{"text":"All the food we had was spectacularly....meh. Nothing was horrible, but nothing was even above ordinary from what you'd find at most italian chains. We had the spaghetti bolognese and chicken parm. 
Our waiter was beyond terrible though. It wasn't one specific thing, just a lot of little things that added up to a poor experience. 
The bus boy/bread deliverer/water guy was great, and that's the only thing I can say positively about the place. At these prices, we definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I have had in a while. Rigatoni Allan vodka was very good. Good service. The only thing I didn't like was the music. On occasion the music went to 80s death love depressing ballads that kind of slowed down the vibe."}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful desserts. My veal osso Bucco was good, lasagna was great! Enjoyed our experience"}
{"text":"We had our holiday luncheon there this past week. It was a hit with all of us. Bryan Forgionne,the executive chef, is incredible. My boss has not stopped talking about the good food and service.  I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"From beginning to end, the food and service was amazing. The live band was good as well. The Caesar salad was great! The croutons were hot and soft...and so good. Definitely coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing meal! Went for husbands 50th bday. When I booked the reservation I asked for a table with a view. Got a fantastic table with a great view. Georgio was the best server, great personality, lots of advice. 

Will definitely go back!

Lisa"}
{"text":"The lasagna is very good, and you must try the Italian birthday cake.  It is expensive, but service was good."}
{"text":"Our server was very attentive and explained the menu in detail. We ordered eggplant parm and grilled octopus. The octopus was tender and flavorful. The eggplant was just bland. Atmosphere was nice and we enjoyed our dinner there."}
{"text":"Well to begin with the restaurant was almost empty at lunchtime so not only was there no wait time but also we got a table with a view. 
My husband and I decided to share an antipasto and a pasta. We started with Grandma's Meatballs. I typically don't like red sauce or meatballs but this was soo soo good. 
Then came Nona's Lasagna Al Forgo. They gave it to us in 2 separate dishes which made it a lot easier to share. The portion size was extremely generous especially for lunch. But we felt that it was very similar in taste to Grandma's Meatballs. Maybe ordering similar sauce dishes wasn't the right decision."}
{"text":"We went to Buddy V's on our last night in Vegas recently and had a great meal and terrific service.  Our server was Melissa - she was right on with her recommendations and clarifying portion sizes (we were trying to avoid leftovers).  The two team members working with her (unfortunately, I didn't get their names) were also very attentive and friendly.  

We had the calamari appetizer and Sunday Gravy entree and both were outstanding.  Certainly enough for two to share and leave a little room for desert.  The Tiramisu has a great chocolate cake layer in the bottom which was a great surprise and very good.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Buddy only knows cakes and cannoli's right? Wrong! We had a great time at Buddy V's. The food was excellent and it was a really fun environment!

My wife had the egg plant parmesan for the first time and loved it! I had the Capellini shrimp scampi.

We loved it all. Even hit Carlo's Bakery on the way out. Fun night!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. We went about 4pm and had the sunset menu which had enough choices for us. Has the fried mozzarella appetizer which was different from normal mozzarella this had so many flavors going on. It was really good. Kids portions were big but also 12.00 a piece. Husband had chicken parm said it was good and had lots of flavors going on as well. Chicken was not dry. Had the Caesar salad was saving room for dessert. Salad was good and just the right amount. Desserts are awesome. Must have is the tiramisu the lady fingers are on the side and you dip them in the mason jar of stuff. My daughter had the apple pie it was ok not too sweet came with vanilla ice cream. Would have liked a little warmer. If your in the area would definitely try it."}
{"text":"BEST ITALIAN IN VEGAS!!!!
I had reservations for Friday (11/28/14) night at 6:15. They had a table for me but it was not in the main dining area. I asked to be moved to the main area but was told I would have to wait. The GM Adam came right over and asked if we could wait about 5 minutes and he personally would get find me a table. He found one for us in about 3 minutes. 

Adam spent about 5 minutes with us going over the menu with us and telling us the history of the restaurant and Buddy. After we got our drinks, Adam came buy again and was going to take our order but we told him we could wait for our server. Adam was very personable and made sure we were taken care of. Way beyond your typical GM.

Now the food, we both ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. I am Italian and am very picky about my Italian food but it was excellent!!! The best I have had in Vegas in years. We also had the awesome Buddy V's special Lobster Tail (pastry) for dessert.A MUST TRY!!!!"}
{"text":"So sad!  We had such high hopes for this place.  We eat out a lot (in fact we are trying a new restaurant every day this winter break!)  This restaurant cannot compete with anything else nearby.  Maggiano's -fabulous, Brio - lovely, Buddy V's -meh.  We had the meatball sand and the vodka sauce pasta.  Both were bland, small and overpriced ($23 for a very small plate of pasta.). No hot bread and butter, no attentive wait staff, no one asked how are meals were, we were invisible.  Then we come to the real reason we went - the lobster tail pastry.  At $15 we were sure it would be crazy good.  It wasn't. The cream inside was luscious and the presentation was beautiful, but the pastry itself was so hard and overcooked we couldn't cut it and that made sharing difficult.  Worst of all, I left my commemorative photo of my little girl and I from  the National Geographic exhibit on the table.  When we realized this 2 hours later we rushed back to the restaurant.  They had thrown it out!  Who doesn't keep people's forgotten things for at least the rest of the day?!  A very bad $64 lunch and a sad tale to tell."}
{"text":"Great dinning experiene. Ask for Peter for service....great prices and value, not to mention tasty food and the best service."}
{"text":"This isnt SPECTACULAR Italian food but it is pretty close. We went with two 70 year olds plus a 9 & 11 yr old and everyone liked their meal. This is one of the few restaurants on the strip that actually has real windows to the outside world (no fake ceiling here) which was refreshing. A little loud in the dining room - but then is Vegas known for being quiet? 
We had:
Salumi plate- salumi was terrific, cheeses better than average, olives OK
Eggplant parm- on app menu & can be shared even though waitress said it was too small for sharing. Easily enough for 6 to share
Scallopps- not very Italian, was it bacon? too over cooked but polenta & scallopps were perfect
The lasagne was HUGE & very good.
Kids chix parm was a large sized portion and excellent. 
Chix marsala came with 3 pieces of chicken!
Ceasar Salad was tastey but way over dressed. Very soggy. Ask for less dressing.
With a bottle of wine & tip our meal for 6 was $300. Not an inexpensive night out so don't be misled by the lower $ on yelp. 

Perfect if you have a mixed crowd & need something for everyone. Can't beat the Ventitian atmosphere either."}
{"text":"Had reservations for 4:30 and didn't realize that they had a sunset menu, with limited choices, that was from 3pm to 5pm. With some finagling, our waiter, Michel, got us dinner entrées. We had the calamari appetizer (very good) and the garlic bread with mozzarella (very good). The fresh focaccia with olive oil and balsamic vinegar was excellent. Our entrées were rigatoni ala vodka with chicken (excellent), chicken parmigiana (excellent), and chicken marsala (excellent).  The portions were perfect. We didn't get dessert because we'd eaten at Carlo's bakery earlier in the day. Dessert menu did look good. 

I'd rate Buddy's 4.5 stars, but because of our waiter Michel, I went up to 5 stars rather than go down to 4."}
{"text":"I've dined at Buddy V's twice now and both times it's been consistently good for both food and service. 

My husband had the meatball sub once for lunch which was the best we've ever had and the other time he had the bone in veal parm chop which was bigger than the size of your head! The octopus and tuna caponata are also delicious and the polenta croutons on the Caesar Salad are delicious! I've never seen polenta croutons in all the Italian restaurants I've dined in. Very creative!

Dessert is also a must, I mean it is the Cake Boss' restaurant. The lobster tail is light and crispy and the tiramisu is soooo good with the chocolate cake on the bottom. 

A trip to Buddy V's is definitely a must and the food was so much better than what I had at Carnevino at a fraction of the cost!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Buddy V's and it was AMAZING. The ambiance was great with really nice live music and lighting, the service was impeccable and our food was out of sight! Our server Giorgio was probably the best server I have ever had! He was so friendly and really went out of his way to take care of us and make us feel at home. We also
Got to spend some time chatting with the manager who was also excellent at his job and runs a top notch place. He even had a fabulous cake sent to our table to help us celebrate our anniversary. We had an amazing evening at Buddy V's. We would highly recommend it to anyone and we will be back soon!! Thanks Giorgio!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Food was incredible.  Location is super convenient. I had spaghetti & meatballs & hubby had meatball sandwich w parmesan fries. Everything was superb.  Highly recommend if you are in Vegas"}
{"text":"Had chicken parm with a side of rigatoni. The chicken was dry and fair tasting. Not a great example of traditional Italian chicken parm. The rigatoni was very tasty, though could have used more sauce. Overall not a bad meal, but was expecting more from them. Pricey, but typical for Vegas."}
{"text":"While back in vegas I could not miss Sunday brunch at Buddy V's. Again very Impressed with everything first of all when I arrived I received a welcoming greeting by by Tiffany who does an awesome job! The food is always consistant and the QUALITY of the food amazing. The staff, EVERYONE is so HOSPITABLE and hard working. This time the GM came by to say hi and chat while I was taking photo of food."}
{"text":"Service, professionalism, and very rarely you find personality. Every staff and manager is the absolute  best and somehow even more. 

It all started off with an awkward menu situation, but was cleared up professionally and cheerfully by the staff and the manager going so far as to make sure we were indeed part of their family and home. 

They have effectively made our Christmas and much more. Will definitely always come back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Bland food that was  ridiculously over priced for the portion size. The staff was extremely unaccommodating and unfriendly with a large group. They refused to split the check which was ridiculous. Overall it was a very disappointing experience for an establishment with Buddy's name on it. I wouldn't recommend it to friends and I will definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Yum! Seriously YUM! Everything including the iced tea was amazing! I have no idea what the croutons on the Cesar salad are but they are DELICIOUS! The chicken piccata, Cesar salad, and lasagna were all incredible. The prices weren't bad either."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, but didn't review the first time 2 years ago.  Now 2 years on taking another family trip (2 adults, 2 kids) we wanted to try this place again as we had such a great experience the first time.  Thought this place would be a big disappointment and all hype due to him being a TV personality. But food is amazing and even better, the price is right!  Highly recommend if you want good Italian on the Strip."}
{"text":"First off - the food was good.  I recommend the Mac & Cheese.  It all went sideways from there.

A group of us decided to give it a try last week.  We got right in and the service was fast.  The server knew nothing about where she worked nor any details about the cake boss himself or the famous bakery across the hall.  We informed her as to who Buddy is.  Bad start for this employee we thought.

Later that night we decided to give the bakery a try and experience the famous treats we had only seen on the TV show.  We waited in the long line and ordered our treats.  After we paid, I heard some construction noise and realized that a construction person was knocking bricks off the wall some 15 feet behind us.  In fact the debris actually hit one of our guests.  In the small bakery their is a small bar to sit at, but in this case that was even closer to the construction guy.  We asked the cashier if we could sit across the hall at the Buddy V's to enjoy our treats.  She said ok but to inform the host.

We crossed the hall and asked the host if we could sit in the dining area that was in the hall, she said no that area was closed.  The restaurant was near empty and I clearly pointed out the construction mess as it was only 30 feet across the hall.  I then asked if we could sit anywhere inside to eat our already paid for treats.  She said no, I should go eat it at the bar inside the bakery.  Needless to say we left and found some tables out in the mall.  

I can not believe that the same establishment from across I the hall would treat people so negatively.  I will not return given their lack of service.  Too bad, the food was pretty good.  They really need some training as to who they work for as well as the true value of a customer.  I will never go back for that reason."}
{"text":"My husband & I just got back from our Vegas trip & before arriving, we had decided to go on a mission of finding the absolute best happy hour on the strip. We were staying at the Palazzo & let me tell you to not look any further!!!

The hostess enthusiastically escorted us to the sexy lounge area adjacent to the dining area.
This is not your typical \"sit at the bar\" experience, it's more like a \"VIP club experience\" with stellar views of the strip. Our super friendly waitress made our experience memorable. The food is totally authentic grandma cooking & the prosecco is a delicious brut, not sweet. The drinks were $4 & the appetizers were $5.
 Just as we couldn't drink or eat another bite, my husband was closing the tab & we quickly realized WTF are we doing turning down desert?? We are in the cake boss restaurant. As we were deciding between cannoli's or tiramisu, our adorable waitress suggested the Nutella cake with espresso ice cream. What a slice of heaven!!!!!!

As soon as the bubbly started to hit, an amazing jazz band ( The fabulous baker boys) arrived & blew us away with their great jazz/Italian hits. They were more than happy to accommodate requests. Dino, Frank, Bobby Darin, they know it!

The vibe reminded me of an old school Italian \"Goodfellas\" experience & because of that, 
This is my new go to spot when I am in Vegas.  : ))"}
{"text":"We had lunch there 11/10/14 while at the Venetian for a few things before we left town. The food was 4.5 stars, but the service was 3. Our actual server was a unfriendly dud. She was not pleasant and acted as if we and the table next to us was an annoyance. The servers' assistant however, was perfect! He was very polite and friendly, he took our drink order and kept them filled as well as boxed up my leftovers. The server took our food order (Hoboken Cheesesteaks - Delish!) but a runner brought our meals from the kitchen, she stood around leaning on the servers' station while we waited for our food and ate, then she turned around as if she were offended when I declined the dessert menu, then she literally dropped our check folio on the table. Yes, I realize they are famous for desserts with Carlo's Bakery across the hall but I had 2/3 of my meal boxed up because of the generous portions, we were stuffed! I hope they split the tips with the assistants because she was awful and the young man took very good care of us the entire meal, even my hubby commented several times about her demeanor and expressed that he wished the assistant was our actual server."}
{"text":"Had a really good experience at Buddy V's.  Nice Italian food and truly HUGE portions.  On a Wednesday night, it was kind of like family night with a lot of kids in the room.  Speaking of kids, the kid menu portion were also huge.  As it turns out, 3 of us could have easily gotten a way with a single entree.  These were heavily cheesy meals with pasta to perfection.  

What keeps the place from being a 5 is that the actual quality wasn't that special but it's a definitely above average offering and experience"}
{"text":"Great meal here last night. Salads were top notch, bacon Mac n Cheese excellent, and each of our three entrees was superb (the lasagna was exceptional). Not a ton of cutting edge dishes here; just classic Italian fare done right! The dessert menu is inventive and excellent- the hot Nutella cake is a winner!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch - I would give it 3 1/2 stars.

The sauce was good, meatballs OK and service very good.

If I had to go back, I would, but I would not seek it out."}
{"text":"Average food, decent service. Nice setting but the grandma meatballs, chicken parmasean,  garlic bread were disappointing."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, awesome food, awesome location. Staff was friendly but not attentive (most into gossiping with each other). 

We ordered the calamari appetiser, chicken pasta and chicken parma. Everything was delusions and the calamari is a must have, however the chicken in the pasta was quite tough as it was reheated and not freshly cooked. Pasta on the other hand was al dente. 

For dessert we got the XL Lobster tail (if you have not tried this, you are missing out on a whole new world). And the trio of donuts (good but not something I would order again)."}
{"text":"Terrible service from the time I called the restaurant to be put on hold for 10 minutes to  make reservations to the host who answered the phone and snottingly responded, \"what's this regarding?\"  really? Its regarding me eating at your restaurant and paying your paycheck.  Really snotty servers and hostesses. Due to possible poor management?  Buddy V would be ashamed.  Really disappointing because the food was great...."}
{"text":"After trying to get a table at other places, we went here. It's not that we didn't think it would be good, but didn't want to go to yet another celebrity-associated restaurant. Enough with the names and prices to go with it. We were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed it. 

There was a wait at 8pm on a Sunday night, so reservations help. We were told the wait would be an hour. We made reservations on-line and only waited 25 minuets! 

The decor is nice-- the ceiling light fixtures are cool. Big whisk attachments-cool use for them. They have an open kitchen and it smells wonderful. Lots of red and dark wood, feels very comfortable. 

We ordered a Caesar salad, garlic bread and panzenella salad to start. The Caesar salad was the best I've had in a long time. Very garlicky, croutons that were warm, soft with a little crunch and a hint of fennel in the salad.  Just the perfect amount of fresh Parmesan cheese. The panzenella was delicious with the same lovely bread, fresh tomatoes and a great dressing. The garlic bread was cheesy, dense and delicious. Just like you imagine good garlic cheese bread should be. 

For dinner, we ordered the spaghetti Bolognese ( for the little one), lasagna, and the Sunday Gravy. The little one wanted lasagna instead, so I traded with him. The kids' spaghetti was plenty for an adult ( I left half of it at that) and incredible. Some of the best I've had that I can remember. The lasagna, although expensive for what it is, was equally delicious. Baked in a cast-iron pan, it was warm, gooey and delicious, with a light tomato sauce on top. The Sunday Gravy was good, but he agreed that  the Bolognese and lasagna were infinitely better. 

We didn't order dessert, but those around us who ordered got cannoli, which looked fantastic. By the way, Carlo's Bakery is across from Buddy V's if you want something for later. 

We would definitely go back and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised. I thought it would rely in its name to generate business. First thing is the service was excellent. Drinks were never empty and servers were friendly and prompt. The food was very good too. My son had Mac and cheese and said it was the best he's ever had. I had an Italian sub and Caesar Salad and both were delicious. We didn't have dessert but from what we saw that was probably a mistake. I'll definitely be back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure where to eat with my husband and two young teen daughters buy took a chance.  This food reminded me of my great grand mother's table.  Meatballs were authentic and loved the veal Marsala.  My girls had the kids chicken parm with was perfect.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.  We finished with cupcakes from the Carlos' Bakery for the girls."}
{"text":"great service, great food, great experience, great ambiance, even general manger stopped by to say hello and check on us."}
{"text":"Brunch was great! My friend and I did the bottomless drinks & buffet brunch. You can mix and match from a few choices of drinks for $14.99. There was a variety of food offerings and it was all pretty good! I will definitely be back! Service was great. Our server was awesome and informative. The manager Emily at the time was great too! She saw us waiting at the meat station and immediately went to help us and another server went to cut up meat and serve us. Great service great food! The entire staff was helpful and friendly. Came here just because I loved watching Cake Boss but my expectations were surpassed!  Try the mac & cheese and chicken parm... don't pass on the Canola! Thanks to our server Freddy...he was the best!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed. Great food and good service. I ordered the Spaghetti Central, had a great flavor to it. Also the fresh bread was a great addition to the meal."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! The veal Marsala melted in my mouth and I mopped up all of the sauce with the perfectly cooked spaghetti it came with. The lobster tail for dessert was amazing! The filling was perfect and held together by a perfect, flaky pastry. Our waiter Rocco was more than accommodating with my multitude of requests and questions - always responding with a pleasant smile and great attitude. Thank you Buddy Vs! We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch on Sunday and it was one of the best brunches we have ever been to in Vegas.  The brunch price was fair $32.95 and then for $14.95 you could have unlimited mix and match drinks from a good selection of adult beverages.

The brunch had quite a few items from the menu and everything was exceptional.

Also the wait staff were really fantastic.  Everyone was friendly and ready  to help in any way.  Dirty plates were removed quickly.

We live in Henderson so we don't usually go to the strip but we will be going back to brunch in the near future."}
{"text":"The staff has their job down to a science and that makes for a very smooth flowing dinner; never had to wait for anything. 
Meatball app was good- perhaps too much for two people. 
Chick parm was decent- not used to baked chick parm. Substituted spaghetti for rigatoni w/ meat sauce. Good flavor."}
{"text":"This place is a must eat has to be the best Italian restaurant is Vegas if the not best overall. The service and environment are second to none. From the time we walked up to the hostess stand to the time we paid we felt we were the the most important customers there and they were quite busy. The food, was absolute amazing the best Italian food I have ever eat. Our waiter was the most patient caring and professional waiter ever (Giorgio) is a must ask for! I would give 12 out of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We ate in the bar area, and thoroughly enjoyed the happy hour food and drinks. The atmosphere was pleasant, while the food and drinks were surprisingly good. Highly recommend the meatballs. The only disappointment was the service from server Miko. He was very chatty with a few tables, while short and dismissive with others. He would take your order, but didn't return to the table to check on you, refill drinks, recommend additional food items to order, take new drink orders, etc. On the other hand, the men and women who cleared the tables, refilled water glasses, brought out new utensils, etc were efficient and pleasant. If management reads these reviews, please pass along praises to your staff who work hard and deserve recognition for a job well done, while taking note of the one employee who seriously missed the mark."}
{"text":"My friend Katie from Calif. chose dinner at Buddy V's to celebrate her 50th birthday, we are so glad she did! We are obliged to express our amazing experience of the service we received by our server Peter on the evening of November 14, 2015. We have always been pleased with excellent food and service we receive at Buddy V's. However, this time Peter's professionalism and attention to details (serving 5 women, each requesting something different) exceeded our expectations and he made the celebration dinner even more memorable. Such commitment to great customer service is to be commended! We highly recommend Buddy V's as a place to celebrate, and request Peter as your server if you want the 5 star dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Buddy, Cake Boss so we tried his restaurant. Food was amazing! Portions are very small for their price. We ordered pasta, thought the serving was too small for $28. 

But you can never go wrong with their desserts. Really the best!!! Cannolis and lobster tails are scrumptious! Tried them in Vegas and New York."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? The food was to die for, the service was even better. Big shout out to Giorgio who educated us not only on the menu choices themselves, but on what wine to try with our meals and even dessert. He checked in frequently, as did the young gentleman who was refilling water glasses (I regret not asking his name). If you like Italian food at all, Buddy V's is a must try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The food here is so fresh and SO good. The restaurant itself is stunning and the service is wonderful."}
{"text":"I went with my family for lunch, and was not disappointed. We had the meatballs for an appetizer. They were delicious and the sauce was so tasty.  All the food was made very well and the restaurant is very nicely decorated. I loved the dessert, so much better here than across the ways at Carlo's Bakery.  Service was great too."}
{"text":"Great family friendly restaurant on the strip, good food and service, variety in the kids menu and an all around great meal.  Chaz was a great server, and is a dead ringer for the Rock!"}
{"text":"This could be the first time I have ever said that a dinner on the strip was a bargain. Not only was it a bargain it was excellent. We had a family dinner with 6 people and did family style dinning. It was wonderful. Tons of food and a wonderful selection of tastes. If you go and have a chance to do the family dinning you would be crazy not too.  The only negative I can say is that it was a bit loud making conversation a tad difficult."}
{"text":"Service was great...went there twice during our stay :) Caesar salad was average and the macaroni carbonara was average but everything else was amazing!  Looking forward to next time!"}
{"text":"It was well worth the wait. Incredible  food. The wait staff was incredibly friendly the food was homemade Italian like my grandmother used to make I am in heaven especially for here in Sin City"}
{"text":"We love Italian Food, and we felt like treating ourselves. We had heard so many good things about Buddy V's, being locals, so we decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed. The service was impeccable - friendly & attentive. The server was knowledgeable and described the dishes well. We are \"Wine Snobs\" so we were worried about the wine selection, but to our surprise they had a great selection of Italian and Californian Wines, and the Server seemed fairly knowledgeable and recommended a suitable Italian Wine. And the food was everything we hoped it would be - classic, fresh, simple and delicious.  The restaurant was busy and vibrant.The kitchen is situated right in the middle of the restaurant, and you can watch the action. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Came here with clients our company brought to vegas. Wanted a place with good food and low cost. Very satisfied! Good service, good food, nice view of the strip from certain parts of the restaurant, cosy family feel. Ordered the bone-in milanesa and it was AMAZING! overall great fun and good food. :)"}
{"text":"We're there sat at 830. No one waiting. The lady ask us to wait for a bit. After 10 mins, the other girl lead us sitting outside of the restaurant. We asked if there is any table inside. She replied. Oh inside, it will be another one and half hr wait. (But clearly there have several tables open inside and it was not a busy night). Then we politely said we will go somewhere else. The lady said. Really, are you sure.       :)  There are lots of choices in Vegas..  We end up with another Italian restaurant.   Thanks but no thanks buddy."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here because our flight landed earlier, and we wanted to find a decent restaurant to eat in. We got there at around 4 and ordered a meatball sub and caprese salad. 

I didn't like how they didn't give us bread but instead some type of cracker. We were hungry, so we munched on until we saw our entrees.

The meatball sub was decent looking with seasoned fries. The fries were tasty, but the meatball sub wasn't worth the money. It was tiny and tasted like it had been heated in the microwave. It was still passable if it was about $10.

The caprese salad was not worth the $16 we paid. From left to right were a whole tomato, a small blob of caprese, about 12 cherry tomato halves drenched in dressing, and a spinach leaf. It was the tiniest salad I've ever eaten. Wasn't that good and definitely not worth the money.

If you're hungry and don't want to spend over $30 for two people, try somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service amazing! You feel at home and very welcomed as soon you walk in the door."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. The place has a nice atmosphere and a live band. When you step out of the restaurant you can smell the fresh cakes out of Carla's bakery"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  We were seated quickly, ordered promptly, food came out quickly, and the wait staff was attentive throughout our experience!  The chicken parm is excellent and the tiramisu is second to none!"}
{"text":"Awesome....came here for Sunday brunch and could NOT have been more satisfied!!  From the doctor your own Bloody Mary bar to the many stations of different foods to try, my husband and I left extremely full and happy!!! A great way to recover from a Vegas Saturday night!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Had lasagne and it was better than any franchise. But pieros is still the best Italian food and this didn't come close. My blend-wine was the best I've had since being on this trip out to Vegas. Service was decent. Piano player/singer was everything!!! Loved it :))"}
{"text":"Above average scallop dinner, however surprised when I receive a bill for $16 beer. I was asked when seated if I wanted small, medium or large, I went with medium. When questioning the $16 charge, I was told this was because I can keep the glass.  I don't want a cheap glass to take home, I want a reasonably priced beer."}
{"text":"We went at prime time for dinner. The place was so full we had to wait 45 minutes for a table.

Once we were seated though the place was great. Service was good though a bit slow at times, the waiter was really passionate about the food and was able to recommend several options for my parents who don't normally eat Italian. 

We ordered the osso buco, the shrimp scampi, and the gravy with rigatoni. All the food came out hot, and parmesan was very quick to be offered.

The food tasted great. Like the waiter said, the osso buco literally fell off the bone, I didn't need the knife at all. It was a bit oily, but otherwise very good. The polenta it was served with was creamy and well seasoned. I felt some vegetables/salad would have gone down nicely, but it was very good overall.

The shrimp scampi tasted very good, but the pasta seemed slightly overcooked (by maybe half a minute) and the sauce a little scarce. Flavour wise it was brilliant. 

The gravy was probably the least impressive in my opinion, the sauce just needed something extra in terms of flavour to really make the meat stand out.

Portion sizes were generous, originally we were keen for dessert or a visit to the cake store just opposite, but it was a bit too much. 

Overall it was a very good meal and one of the few decent Italian places I've been to in Vegas or anywhere else and it shows in how busy they were, but it seemed slightly let down by some small details."}
{"text":"Wow, we loved everything we ate here! The lasagna was the perfect balance of cheeses, sausage, pork, and tomato sauce. The chopped vegetable salad was loaded with veggies and garbanzos and perfectly dressed. Don't even let me get started on the heavenly meatballs. I just kept eating even after I was full because I rarely get food this good. Thank you, Buddy!"}
{"text":"Just went in for happy hour and sat at the bar, service was good and the small plates where not bad. They also do a all happy hour out on the patio too."}
{"text":"My brother claims the garlic cheese bread takes like its made by Jesus... And it does. Most amazing garlic cheese bread ever. Although, fettuccine Alfredo is not on the menu.. You can order Alfredo with other noodles and chicken. My brother rated that a 5. My mom got the chicken Parmesan and said it was a 5 star meal as well. I got the spaghetti with meatballs and I have to go with my mom and brother and say mine was 5 stars as well."}
{"text":"This a casual place.  Background music was 70's and 80's, which was fine by me; as I walked in, Tom Jones was playing followed by The Who.  And the beat went on.

Ordered Grilled Octopus; broth was spicy and tasted good.  The problem was the rest.  Actual octopus was fine; only thing was, there was only one bite and rest was filled by greens and potatoes!

Then ordered Shrimp Scampi for main course.  It was with angle hair pasta which was fine.  Taste was fine.  Here again, there were only 4 medium size shrimps with tails on to make them look bigger than actually they were!

I understand this is Vegas and understand this was inside of a casino; but, by no means one gets his/hers money's worth.  There are many other Italian places in the same casino that serve great Italian food and one gets close to reasonable amount for his/her money!"}
{"text":"WOW My husband and I have been here 5 times already, Our server Rocco has been the best of the best, the food is delish and the desserts are to die for, a must is the Lobster Tail Pastry with fresh fruit, the cannoli's come in second best but all are good
Every visit we ordered something different to try and we have not been disappointed
one of my fav's is the margarita pizza, last night we had the sunday gravy pot, meatballs, pork, lamb, sausage with a bowl of rigatoni, so yummy, we had friends from NJ visit last month and this was the first place we took them, they can not wait to return
matter of fact I can't wait for our next visit, so until then I will have to patience but it won't be long,  thanks Buddy for opening on the strip
see you soon"}
{"text":"Best pasta carbonara I have eaten to date. The rest of my family also seemed very pleased with their dishes. I'll be coming back in the future. My family has been there once before without me and said the service was incredible. I didn't necessarily get that experience but the food was wonderful. 

Tip: the garlic bread is phenomenal"}
{"text":"Great environment and great service. There was live music and our serve was nice enough to walk us through the menu. We got the salad and the lasagna, which was both amazing. The salad was too salty for my taste, but I guess I should have asked for light dressing. Otherwise, everything was great!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a business trip and I remember a friend posting on FB what a wonderful dinner she had at Buddy V's a few months back so I checked it out on Yelp.  After viewing the pictures, I had my heart set on the lasagna but the chicken parm also looked good so I asked the waiter what he would recommend.  He said both were good but since I was by myself, I should have the chicken parm because the lasagna was large enough to serve two.  Since I was there in time for their pre-show prix-fix menu, and chicken parm was on that, I went with that selection.  The Caesar salad had a nice dressing, not overly powerful.  The chicken parm was good but not so delicious that it made me not wish that I tried to lasagna instead.  I went with the chocolate hazelnut cake (can't remember the exact name) and that was delicious.  I really wanted to try the lobster tail, but it was not one of the options on the prix fix, but unlike the entrée, I was not disappointed that I didn't have what I walked in intending to order.  Although the chicken parm was a bit disappointing, it wasn't bad, just nothing special.  I would go back to try the lasagna."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous evening at Buddy V's last night. Sat in the bar with my husband and enjoyed the meatballs, caprese salad, shrimp scampi pasta and lasagna. We got all the food at once so we could have a little bit of everything at once. 
Everything was cooked to perfection and OMG the mozzarella was amazing. 
Definitely worth a visit if you like Italian cooking!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, the ravioli's were to die for!  Excellent service, very professional and friendly.  Crazy good deserts, but that is to be expected!  Wonderful atmosphere with a great price point!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go before you catch a show. Not to pricey for a nice meal in Vegas and the food is good. I enjoyed eating here but it wasn't anything spectacular."}
{"text":"Here for the Super Bowl, if you are thinking a great combination good food and football big mistake the food and waiters service along with the tv size is a big disappointment don't waste your time"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Host sat us at the bar when she said that the dinning room was full. After us a bigger party came in and they were sat in the dinning room."}
{"text":"We went to Buddy V's for a late lunch around 2:30. The restaurant was less than half full, plenty of seating, no wait. There were 4 of us, with two more on the way. The not so pleasant manager said they do not sit incomplete parties...are you joking, there were so many open tables!! We said we'd like to be seated to order drinks, they refused. So we waited a few minutes, went back up to the host stand asked if they really couldn't seat us with all the open tables, it seemed a little ridiculous.  Still a very rude no. We left went to another Venetian Italian restaurant, got seated right away.  Will never go back, horrible service. I understand if your busy, but they weren't, just very rude and unaccomadating."}
{"text":"We went to Buddy V's on our anniversary for wine and cheese.  We were very impressed with the portions on the cheese/salumi platter.  The wine was delicious and the service we received from Pete our waiter was outstanding.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This review is based truly on the service and not the food.  My husband and I ate here on 3/9/14 during Restaurant Week while visiting Las Vegas.  I would like to start off and say that we are lenient when it comes to services.  It is a very hard job and not everyone is cut out for the job and unfortunately Perry M. at Buddy V's is one of them.  
Our evening started out with us walking up to the hostess station around 5:15 that Sunday evening.  We asked the two ladies if we could have a window table.  They stated it was going to be about 20 to 30 minutes.  We stated no problem that we will go to the bar and have a drink to please come over and get us when the table was ready.  They stated that was fine.  We ordered two drinks at the bar and about 20 minutes later we saw two tables being cleaned at the window area.  So my husband was paying close attention and before we knew it the hostess was taking up a couple that had just arrived.  Luckily a table was being cleared up behind them so my husband had to go grab the hostess to remind her of our table.  She then remembered we were waiting and sat us down.  Point being, if my husband wasn't keeping an eye out we would have lost those window seats we were waiting on.  
Now on to our next adventure, we meet our waiter Perry M., he asked if we wanted water and we stated we did.  The assistant waiter came through and gave us bread and I stated thank you to him, but got no response back.  Perry then came back and got our food order.  The food came out as scheduled and was delivered by a young gentleman from the kitchen.  Our assistant waiter came by and gave us more bread and again I said Thank You with no response.  I come from the south and when someone says thank you, your response should be Your Welcome or My Pleasure.  To me this is plain rude.  Again, we are just holding our tongues in the whole situation.  My husband wanted another beer.  Ever since Perry ordered our food we never saw him again at the table to ask how everything was.  I told my husband to put the empty glass on the edge of the table maybe he will notice it and walla' he did.  My husband asked for another beer and he went on his way.  At this time our water glasses are now empty.  Well after 10 minutes still no beer has arrived at the table.  By this time the dessert has arrived and my husband and I are sharing a glass of water since we have not been refilled or asked if we wanted any.  Again, we are not saying anything.  We don't ask for much.  We know it is hectic sometimes doing this job.  We were going to let go not getting the beer, but we do like for our water to be filled up WITHOUT having to ask.  So we just asked for the bill and were just going to chalk it up to bad experience and not return.  Until our bill came, the first two charges are for the restaurant week special at 30.14 per person (which is correct).  Then two additional entrees where added and the kicker was he added the beer that never arrived.  Our total check should be in the range of 60+ change, but the total was 122.00.  So that is the point my husband lost it and grabbed the manager.  
The manager that night was Sean Fiori whom assisted us.  We explained everything to him expect the experience with the hostess earlier.  We explained our experience with Perry M and his assistant.  We showed him the bill and he immediately apologized and said he will fix the bill and gave us an after dinner drink to make up for not getting the beer.  We are not people to complain.  We put up with a lot from waiters/waitress, but this was awful.  We are simple people and want to be acknowledged and respected and just fill up our drinks every now and then.  Literally he orders our food and gave us the messed up bill.  That was all and wants us to tip you on this service.  Don't get me wrong.  We had no problems with the food, but the service made this experience awful.  Hopefully he gets continued training or he needs to find another profession."}
{"text":"Food and service were great.  We reserved ahead of time, we were accommodated quickly upon arrival and given a nice view of the strip.  Fresh baked focaccia was great.  Grilled octopus was a little spicy but good.  Best dish of the night for us was the Orecchiette & Italian Sausage."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Italian food, which is what you might expect from a unique restaurant owned by an Italian family. The staff was wonderful as well, from the hosts at the front all the way to the manager who greeted us and had a minute or two conversation with us. 

The menu suits itself to family style dining. My wife and I each had drinks, split garlic bread with oil and vinegar, and the pollo rigatoni alla vodka, which is one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. The polenta croutons on the Caesar salad must be tried to be believed. The salad looks so simple that you might be disappointed when it comes to the table vs. my wife's house salad with beautiful heirloom tomatoes, but both were exceptional.

Contrary to many of the reviews I read, they do bring some small bread. Thinking that we didn't, we ordered the garlic bread, which could easily be split between 4-6 people. It was a little much, and if I did it over, I'd leave off the garlic bread and order dessert. We were simply too full! 

I'd you're looking for phenomenal food that's not terribly expensive (with drinks and all we were under $80), don't even give it a second thought, and come here. You may want to reserve your table through open table or something similar to get in quickly. Our reservation was delivered exactly on time."}
{"text":"I don't even know how to explain how horrible service was. After being seated, we waited about 15 minutes for our server to take drink orders! He was hardly apologetic and to make matters worse, he was so rude while I asked him a few questions about the appetizers. 

After 45 minutes of ordering, we finally received our food. It was okay. Not worth the bad service. 

I have been to many restaurants and I have never felt so uncomfortable or treated so rudely from a server, ever."}
{"text":"Got to try Buddy V's today with some co-workers... The atmosphere is open and has a modern with a hint of old world vibe going on. I had the Chicken Parm, which was a huge portion and was a great dish I will enjoy for dinner too! The smashed meatball sub and the Salmon were ordered by the others in the party and all said they really enjoyed their dishes! We also got an order of the garlic bread which was the right amount of garlic and cheese! The service was good and nicely paced! Overall great experience, great food and I would recommend this place to others! Sadly we were too full to order dessert."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Vegas from Atlanta, relaxing and enjoying her birthday weekend. 
Bobby V's was one of the eatery's I specifically wanted to visit while we were here. Upon being seated we were met with welcoming and friendly customer/guest service. 
Caleb was our server and hit a Grand Slam in doing so. He was very attentive to our request and even provided suggestions when I seemed unsure. 
I ordered the Tomato & Basil soup and my wife ordered the  Aunt Nina's Mozzarella en Carozza for appetizers. At first bite, the authenticity of the food was evident and the Riesling and Moscato wine that followed were right on time. 
Shortly after finishing the appetizers, our entrees showed up and my wife's Capellini Shrimp Scampi and my Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno  dishes pushed the experience over the top. 
All the while being treated like relatives by Adam, the Asst. General Manager. I pulled Adam to the side and mentioned that I had a confession and that was, that my wife and I eat out a lot, while home and this was the best all around experience we've had in a long time and thanked him for the wonderful experience. 
The cherry on top was when they brought out a piece of Chocolate Expresso cake, on the house, for the Mrs.'s birthday and a couple of lattes.
This customer service is what I strive to exemplify in my own business at Ambassador Barbershop, Atlanta, GA, because long term relationships are better than short term money, any day. 
Adam and Caleb, we'll see you next time we're in Vegas.
Thanks again,
K. Jones"}
{"text":"What a treat!  I made reservations for two the day before we decided to go.  We walked up and were seated quickly.  Our server greeted us shortly thereafter.  The menu has such a great variety of classic  Italian staples. It was hard to decide what we were going to eat.  For the appetizer, we ordered Mozzarella en Carozza (\"mozzarella in a carriage\").  Hands down, this was the most delicious appetizer we've had in such a long time.  The crust was nice and crispy.  But the gravy (sauce) just took it over the top.  It was so full of flavor.  It was a nice balance of tomatoes and basil.
 
For the main course, my hubby ordered the Sunday Gravy.  I loved the presentation.  They served the meat in a separate metal pot.  Plenty of sausage, lamb necks, pork and meatballs.  It's served with rigatoni.  This entrée was so tasty that we immediately started looking for the recipe on the internet.  I ordered the Linguini with Clams.  It came with plenty of clams.  The portion sizes were perfect.

We were pretty stuffed by the time we were done with our meals.  However, we wanted to try a dessert while we were there.  I loved the dessert menu. It looks like a family photo album with pictures of Buddy and his family.  We selected the Italian Wedding Cake.  I didn't think I had any room for dessert.  But this little cake was so good that we knew we had to finish it all. Luckily we had a long walk ahead of us. The restaurant was at the far end of the shops in the Venetian.  We will definitely make this a must the next time we're in Las Vegas.   You should too.  We plan to try the chicken parm.  The atmosphere was what were looking for.  It was like a huge Italian farmhouse kitchen.  And you could see into the kitchen.  Loved the whole experience."}
{"text":"Okay, the hostess took awhile to sit us down.  On the phone but didn't even look at us to smile.  This is they reason why I gave 4 instead of 5 star.  But overall, our waiter was nice and prompt.   The order were fast.  The food is alright.  We heard about the bakery and always see a long line.   We decided to give their dessert a try.  It's not the best we've tried but it's alright."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a perfect experience for any Cake Boss fan. The food tastes like you stepped into Buddy's home. Very delicious! And the portions are the perfect size. The garlic bread is amazing and fresh. And you have to go for the lobster tail for dessert!"}
{"text":"My family and I had lunch at the restaurant,  food was amazing, being from Honolulu you can't get better than Buddy V's, our busboy Ron was awesome, raspberry  iced tea great . Being a chef from Honolulu it's an eye opening experience. Good job Buddy, open one in Honolulu please . Mahalos  Robert Denis"}
{"text":"Would have given this place five stars because my husband and I really enjoyed our dinner when we dined there on our vacation last week. But we felt our waiter although very nice was not totally truthful and sneaky. We had ordered a salad and the fried mozzarella for an appetizer, both were delicious! But our waiter casually asked if we wanted cheesy garlic bread and the way he asked it came across that it was complementary...it wasn't $9.00 :/ the other thing was that my husband and I had both ordered beers, and when I had ordered mine he pulled out the menu and pointed to two choices and asked which one I wanted...I just pointed to the smaller of the two choices. When we got our bill it turned out he had added on a souvenir glass (an extra $5.00) without informing me that was what he was doing. So we felt we got a little bit scammed into adding on all these extras. So ask questions before you just say \"sure!\" to something."}
{"text":"Kind of a disappointment, we had the chicken parm and the chicken was very dry! Everything else was very mediocre not worth the price, kinda expected more from buddy"}
{"text":"Love this joint! Carlos - why don't you open one of these in NJ? The Sunday sauce is to die for. Also loved  the shrimp scampi & the Nutella cake.  Thank you Peter (our waiter) for making the evening! You are the best!"}
{"text":"Outstanding from start to finish. Caprese salad was great. The gravy dish was loaded with veal, meatballs and sausage. And the best part, the desserts!"}
{"text":"Was told it would be 30 mins and it was 50 mins while I could see seats open. Then they cram as many seats and tables together where I am less than 2 feet from someone not in my party. Could not turn my head without feeling like I was invading someone else privacy. Also some tables is right next to kitchen and with all the banging and yelling in kitchen could not hear myself think much less have a conversation. Server disappeared for 15-20 at one point. Food was average. Basically running on name alone"}
{"text":"Terrible service! People that work there really unhelpful!! Don't recommend at all!!  We came there to get a desert and they gave us a table at lounge area, after we gave the order they asked for my ID which I didn't have with me and told us that we can't seat in that area, first of all we didn't even ask to seat there and they told us to leave and didn't even give us a different table. Why would they even give us a table make us do an order and then tell us to leave? Terrible !!! Terrible service!!"}
{"text":"Soo excited to go to the Cake Boss restaurant and bakery! The food and atmosphere was great! service was excellent!! The chocolate mousse cake was the most amazing cake I've ever eaten!!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing and they were very attentive. I tried the chicken parmesan and spaghetti which was delicious. There lasagna was humongous. Overall a 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"When arriving we had a huge joyful greeting from the hosts. We had reservations but I want a widow seat for my party.  They quickly when into action to make my request happen. They said it would be 20min but was only 10. Wow the appetizers are very flavorful we had mom's meat balls and eggplant, I recommend both. Very diverse wine and drink list. Main dish was cooked to perfection, the steak and the veal was our choices both very well prepared and delightful. Server has very good and attentive too. 2 piece music group in bar area was outstanding. This is a great pic for a good meal. Peace out!!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Venetian and decided to eat here. Food was great. Probably some of the best Italian I've ever had. The service was great. Our cups never went empty and when I spilled a scant amount of tomato sauce on my shirt, the waiter came out of nowhere and gave me club soda to help with the stain and it worked! I will definitely be coming back here the next time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I brought my daughter here for her birthday lunch. She has a passion for cooking and baking and Buddy is her idol. She was so excited. We made a reservation for the 6 of us. When we showed up I was automatically taken back by the lack of personality and sheer lack of respect from the hostess. I must have high standards seems how I work in a restaurant but I certainly would expect more from a restaurant of its caliber and popularity. We had no greeting, no hello, no nothing. When we were seated we were handed menus and we knew it was a bit pricy before we went so that wasn't a shocker. It's the Las vegas strip and you're paying for the name. But honestly for the price and because of the name I really pictured a warm, friendly atmosphere. Not a cold environment where we were treated like we intruded and were not welcome. I felt so sad for my daughter. She was excited to go there for the amazing experience she thought she'd have and to have my 12 year old on her birthday feel so let down and disappointed about the service is very disheartening. She felt like she was personally let down by Buddy himself. The food was good but when you feel so unwelcome, it ruins the entire experience. Such a bummer that the Bake Shop service wasn't any better either. Can't say I'll be going back and I Definately don't think this is how Buddy would want people to feel walking into his restaurant because he is such a family guy who's welcoming and makes it feel like home."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best eggplant Parmesan I have ever had!!!!  Def try it as an app or a small main."}
{"text":"We ordered the veal marsala for 24 bucks, not sure if we got veal or pork, it was way tough than any other veal I have had. Sauce was over powered by wine sauce and that's pretty much all I tasted. Probably won't come back here again"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! It reminds me of family from the moment you walk in! Te atmosphere is remarkable. The decor blends perfectly with what Buddy stands for and who he is. The most memorable aspect would have to be the chandeliers. They had whisks handing from them as well. That shows creativity and passion. The food was amazing! The flavor profile was on point and we got to try the canolis. 

Overall  service was great,  the place was clean, the dishes were affordable, and the environment felt like home. Thanks Buddy for a great experience in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food was okay( something you can get at a regular Italian restaurant), the service was amazing, very friendly. Me and my husband were celebrating our one year anniversary and a day that special I would of prefer spending it some where, where they don't take your plate when your not finish. It was a Sunday and not that busy but it was like they were trying to kick you out. Not the best experience, never coming here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!!!
Came here for lunch on Labor Day. There was no wait to be seated which was great.

The Food is soooo good !!!!!! We ordered the 
Aunt Nina's mozzarella en carozza for an antipasto. Let me tell you that is a definite order again next time we go back. My husband ordered the Lisa  V's linguine & white clam sauce and I ordered the chicken parm. The servings are big that I could not even finish one of the pieces of chicken parm after the app. and of course saving room for the lobster tail for dessert that we shared between the both us because it is huge. It is bigger than the ones you get at the bakery across the from restaurant. 

Everything we had was soooo good and can't wait until we go back in the future to try something different on the menu but this time it will be for dinner to have a bigger selection to choose from than the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The wait staff was kind and attentive. Even though the place was packed, we were never unattended. I had the scallops and they were easily the best ive ever had. My mom had the turkey lasanga and it was so good. Definetely reccomend those two things."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. My hubby and I had a delicious meal. if you go after 6 , it was crowded. We arrived at 500 so we avoided the crowd.  Service was ggreat!!!"}
{"text":"We made an OpenTable reservation.  We arrived five minutes early and we were seated right away.  Our waiter, Charlie, was able to answer our questions about the menu with ease.  He provided the right amount of attention to us without being intrusive.  We were a party of 3.  I had the orecchiette and Italian sausage.  It was rich and flavorful, with only a hint of spice, which was exactly what I wanted.  My husband Tim and my friend Gina both ordered the linguini with clams.  They liked it a lot.  I've been friends with Gina for 25 years, and this was probably the only time I've seen her finish an entree at a restaurant!  If you're concerned, don't be; the portion size was generous.  I also had the Italian greens.  They were good and the portion size is large enough for two if you want to share.  We finished with cannoli and apple pie.  Both are worth trying and can easily be shared."}
{"text":"No stars..... Had Reservation at 9:15. We just walked out at 9:48 after not one person came for our order.  Worst service ever experienced. Restaurant was not busy by any means."}
{"text":"First time here and it was an overall great experience. Our waiter Charlie was fun, energetic and knowledgable on the menu. Tried \"My dads bucatini carbonara\" which was excellence. The Nutella cake was super delish! Will be going back for sure"}
{"text":"I didn't know until just this moment that we were there only the second week they were open.  We had no idea this was there, but were at the Venetian and followed our noses.  Service was excellent, attentive, but not invasive.  We weren't that hungry, but proceeded to order the octopus appetizer which was great.  The octopus was cooked perfectly.  

My husband ordered the (I think it was called the Sunday gravy or something).  It was a pot with red sauce, sausage, veal, and meatballs.  He said it was very good.  I ordered the eggplant parmesan appetizer and the creamy polenta side.  I was too full to finish it, but it was delicious.  The eggplant had a wonderfully crisp coating and was not mushy at all.  The polenta was creamy and wonderful.

I also had a frozen Bellini that was yummy.  We are talking about going back to Vegas just to eat there again!"}
{"text":"The chicken parm was delicious. However service was not the greatest. We waited 10 mins at our table before someone even came to our table. After ordering The waiter never came around to ask if we needed anything, we finally had to stop another waiter to ask for a refill on our water."}
{"text":"My husband & I dined here 11/17 to celebrate my bday. First off the place is difficult to find. They are so new the restaurant wasn't listed on the directory. We had a hard time finding it & even after asking an employee at palazzo they had no idea where it was! We called buddy v's and they directed us where to go. I was disappointed where they seated us, we had a seat facing the kitchen while the gorgeous view was behind us. I thought since we had a reservation& a bday to celebrate we should have been able to enjoy the view. The food definitely made up for the bad seat. My husband ordered the chicken Parmesan and I ordered chicken Marsala. Both were excellent, but the chicken Marsala was the best I've ever had. Service was awesome, no complaints there. Can't wait to go back!  Hopefully we'll have a better seat next time."}
{"text":"Had a great meal, appetizer, chicken Parmesan and dessert were all great at a good price."}
{"text":"Very good meal! My friend and I were satisfied with what we had while on a trip to Vegas.  After several mediocre/disappointing meals, the items we had at Buddy V's left us very pleased! 

Definitely recommend the calamari fritti (something similar to that spelling) it is the option hat is breaded and comes with green peppers and lemon aoli. It was fabulous and perfectly cooked. 

We also shared the veal Marsala.  The noodles and the actual marsala sauce on the veal were VERY good.  Thumbs up! 

Their canolis looked amazing but we were too full to get any. Next time though! :)"}
{"text":"Buddy V's Ristorante is a lovely place to go for home-style cooked Italian food.  The menu offers a variety of appetizers, salads, pasta, chicken, veal and seafood.  Last but not least, the cakes are insanely delicious- not surprising, seeing the restaurant is owned by the Cake Boss himself.  Do whatever you have to do to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went in here tonight around 7. The hostess was very polite and seated us right away. We sat ignored at our table for over 20 minutes, we were never even offered water. We finally left and found another place to eat. Very disappointing, we were excited to eat there and the food looked delicious."}
{"text":"Ambience was good 
Ordered fried calamari and lasagna. 

Fried calamari: 
Portion was okay for 2 to share. 
Could have been more deep fried. 
Came out a tad bit soggy 
The breaking fell off for the most of the pieces. 
Too salty 
Size of calamari was food 

Lasagna- 
Good portion for two to share
Taste is home made- which is what they are going for."}
{"text":"I loved this place. It reminded me of the old Villa Penza and other old school joints where the cook or the owner mingles and sits with you for a while and makes you feel at home even though they know you are leaving.  These are the special touches that made the old school joints what they were with tile floors and checkered tablecloths and the food was nectar of the gods and 'ambience' was for people who didnt know anything about food.

These elements gave us the confidence to break some rules like 'never order spaghetti and clam sauce outside of the metropolitan area'.

The simplicity of this dish was a revelation.  The DeCecco macaroni was cooked to perfection, It was the perfect platform for the teeny tiny baby clams that are mandatory for this dish and no substitutions.  The fragrance of the baby clams, the garlic, the textures, it was just magnificent and like no other commercially prepared dish we have had in years.  Kudos!

I dont like sitting on top of the kitchen.  Its too loud and too hot.  This was neither.  It was very entertaining.  They were loving the food they were preparing and it made you that much more excited about how good it was going to be to see this.

The veal marsala was fantastic.  It was good quality veal and the marsala was not cloying and sickeningly sweet as the cheap marsalas are.  This was proper marsala.

The osso buco was great, cooked to perfection, falling off the bone resting on a pool of creamy polenta.

I highly recommend the 'birthday cake' for dessert.  Its an experience.

While many of these authentic homestyle dishes are stylized for presentation, this is the way we really eat in  NJ.  Great meatballs.  

This visit was AFTER Gordon Ramsay Steak and in no way was it a letdown, it was right up there with GR.  

Kudos to Adam Margolies and his exceptional staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my family of five as we cruised through the Venetian for a late lunch. We were really headed to Carlos' Bakery but were hungry and went in to Buddy's.

Two kids got meatball sandwiches, one got the margherita pizza, and my wife and I split the salumi and cheese plate with a couple glasses of house red. Happily I got a few bites of the meatball sandwich and it was probably the best I've ever had. The salumi and cheese plate was a great split for a light meal, with excellent meats, cheeses, and I loved the olives. Not normally an olive fan. My daughter really liked the pizza, too.

The bill was about eighty five bucks and the service was good, not great.

Tip: If you want to hit the bakery, grab a number before or during your meal. There was a significant wait for the bakery, although perhaps the novelty will have worn off after a little time has passed."}
{"text":"These guys are a solid 3.5.  The service is very good, it is Vegas after all.  It is though a chain-like, more modern casual Olive Garden.  The food is a bit better than Olive Garden with some good items like the Sunday Gravy.  If you're expecting high quality Italian food this might not be the best stop. If you want some comfort food at a decent price, this is a good choice. 

Sadly they don't have much from the Carlo's bakery dessert menu though."}
{"text":"Positive - Nice view. Nice atmosphere. Polite staff. 

Negative - Too pricey for what you get. I felt the food quality was pretty low. The person I went with didn't care for it either and it was his second visit."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Underseasoned capellini shrimp scampi with not even a hint of garlic. It had flavorless shrimp - boiled instead of sautéed?  Merely average lasagna. Bland, gummy focaccia that needed longer baking and the addition of rosemary. At these expensive prices, expected better food. 

On the plus side, service was quick and waitstaff excellent (otherwise this place would only have gotten 2 stars). The olive oil/balsamic dipping sauce was excellent (but not enough to redeem the sorry focaccia). The lemonade was great - for $10, glad it came with free refills."}
{"text":"A small group of us went to try this place out for dinner and overall we loved it! The food was good and so were the cocktails. I liked that the menu was kind of small because as it was I couldn't even decide what I wanted to eat, lol. I finally decided on the chicken Marsala and the sauce was yummy.. The noodles that were served with it were a little salty for my taste but I still liked the dish. We also had the pizza and spaghetti and meatballs, which they said it was good too... I recommend the calamari for a starter."}
{"text":"The prices were reasonable and the food was very good. The waitress was just ok, I had asked to do a  doggy bag which she forgot. She was also supposed to find out a having a cake sent to my little girl, but she never did find out. I finally just left. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"So this is the second time we go to Buddy V this week. We loved the Sunday Gravy but it is a lot of food, so come hungry. We went in a Thursday night so the band was planning, those guys are great, music was good and they really make an effort to play the music you want to hear. Hersh was our waitress, she's awesome. Props to her, very nice and came by to make sure we were good many times. She deserves a raise. Lastly, the location is great and it is a nice resturant so I highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"By far the worst sevice i have ever had in a restaurant.  We had a party of 6 sit down for dinner and a birthday celebration.   No bread no  water for 20 minutes oue appetizers were ordered and another 30 minutes for those.  Do even get me started on how long for the entrees to arrive.   Horrible, horrible sevice.  Another couple got up and left after similar poor service.  Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a fabulous meal we had last week. My husband and I are major foodies and have eaten at some of the best Italian places in the USA. We loved the best of course in Boston little Italy and Buddy Vs is as close as it gets.  I had the Osso Buco and my husband had the ravioli,  and both were amazing. We had to keep sharing with everybody at our table.  The only trouble we had was finding it.  It is on the second floor, but we kept asking for directions from everybody in the Venetian  and nobody could tell us.  Finally a drink server put her full tray of drinks down and went to a wall phone and got directions for us. You would think they would have training on directions in the hotel on how to get what you are looking for.  But it was definitely worth the navigating.  We will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant a tout faux ! Dès l'accueil on vous place selon votre tenue si vous n'êtes pas chemise et pantalon vous serez placé au bar en vous faisant croire que c'est pour patienter le temps qu'une table se libère. Le bar avec ses tables bancales et son chanteur qui se prend pour franck Sinatra est un endroit insupportable, impossible de tenir une conversation. Finalement on vous apporte vos plats (seul point positif car bien cuisiné). Vous payerez 24 dolls pour des pates ou des lasagnes merci ! En bref un mauvais moment"}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night. They weren't too busy Got seated right away, server was so nice and accommodating (as we were in a hurry) and everything looked very nice and Italian. 

The food is kind of expensive. ($15-30) 
We ordered 2 appetizers (garlic bread and meatballs) BOTH taste yummy! We got six pieces of each. There were four of us and we finished everything. We also split the shrimp scampi and it was good too. (Nothing unique but it definitely hits the spot and is satisfying.) we left very happy."}
{"text":"Best meal in Las Vegas. Much better than Delmonico's (Emeril's place). 5 star service from Georgio.  We have eaten somewhere different for almost a week and this was the best.  Ask for the family style sampler. We didn't see it on the menu but they bring their signature appetizers, entrees and desserts. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Ate here twice during our stay because it was so good. Fantastic Italian food and feel-like-family service. So many restaurants disappoint, but this one lives up to the hype. Ordered an appetizer, salad and entree each time and loved 'em all. The spaghetti and meatballs were the best evah! 
Also, be sure to order dessert!"}
{"text":"We tried to go there last night and, if the hostesses don't change their poor customer service, this place won't be there for too much longer.
Walked up at 5:15 p to make a reservation for 8 at 6 p. The restaurant was very light with guests and, there were plenty of open tables in our sight.
One hostess told us the earliest we could be seated was 7:15 p. Then, a 2nd hostess popped up and said it wouldn't be before 7:45.
Not a problem, we went to Cannaletto in the Grand Canal Shops. We were accommodated, the food and wine was superb. It was a great dining experience.
Buddy, you better go visit soon or, you're going to regret it. Your restaurant management is killing your restaurant and, your reputation."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to come here, we were really hungry after a long day of sightseeing and it was our last night in Vegas. Ready to indulge one last night. We were seated in the couch/lounge. I thought it looked cozy, only to sit on an extremely awkward, low, deep sunken in seat. Odd. But can be overlooked. 

Our server Christin was nice enough, not really helpful when we asked for an opinion of favorites. So I ordered the veal marsala and my husband ordered the ravioli. (How can you mess up ravioli?) Well... after a long wait for food to roll out, his ravioli was disappointing and very very salty. Same salt issue with the veal. My pasta on my plate tasted like pasta roni, and was cold. My veal, extremely hot. The ravioli portion was small and didn't even begin to fill him up even though he tried to stomach the saltiness. 

Our birthday canolli was a nice thought, but we didn't really eat it. Maybe we ordered the wrong items? But this felt like a dressed up version of the olive garden. A bit disappointed to end our trip this way. My favorite meal was at B&B downstairs."}
{"text":"Had heard good things and wanted to stop by before seeing a show however the hostess was on a major power trip and wouldn't even FATHOM letting us sit at the completely empty bar in the completely empty restaurant (no joke this was 5pm and there were maybe 3 people in the entire thing). All we wanted were some appetizers and drinks and they wouldn't even let us in because they were \"completely booked\" that night and people were coming \"at any second\". Since when do restaurants book spots at the bar?? We were completely incredulous and the hostess could not have been ruder. She definitely gets off on shooing people away, but honey this isn't an exclusive club it's the Cake Boss's restaurant..."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome.  That is how I would describe every aspect of this restaurant.  My wife is a huge cake boss fan, and we were told Buddy opened a restaurant.  Of course, she thought we should try it and I was glad she forced the issue.   We started with grandmas meatballs, and they were tender and delicious.  Followed this up with the Lasagne and I will say that I am a bit of a Lasagne snob and am very picky.  Up to this visit, I openly stated that my home made lasagne was the best I have ever had, and I now have to admit that Buddy's was a bit better.  A very healthy portion that I could not finish, and the mix of cheeses, meats, pasta, spices and sauce was a true delight.

The waiter we had was great and was extremely helpful with the menu and wine choices.  I would suggest to anyone to go here for a good hearty, filling meal.  Great job Buddy!"}
{"text":"A bit hard to find but worth it. Good food and good value for money. I just wish the staff was a but more attentive"}
{"text":"Great service by the service staff. Recommending all the food and wine to us. The starters Buratta salad is great, as well as the calamari. We loved our prawn pasta. Amazing. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special. Chicken Parm was delicious. Also came with tomato basil soup. Prob one of the best versions I've ever had. Very tasty. Appetizer main course and dessert for under $22. Very good deal and worth the price."}
{"text":"First of all, very hard place to find. It's tucked in a lone hallway across from RockBar and of course Carlos Bakery. Went to Carlos to get a couple pastries and decided to poke in and see what this place has to offer.

Went for an early dinner with my wife and was seated by the window in the back next to what im guessing is a party room. View was amazing, service mediocre, food a little high priced (the strip) but overall not bad at all. I had the osso buco my wife had the carbonara and we started with a panzanella salad. Server was pretty absent for the most part, but the view made for good conversation and weren't in any hurry. Overall i wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if i found myself stuck in the Venetian i might wonder back over."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time here for brunch... if I could give it six stars I would! We were lucky to get Charlie as our server... he was amazing! He knew what I wanted before I asked for it... ten stars for him! You should definitely come here... ask for Charlie!"}
{"text":"Went for a birthday celebration and they made it nice with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the dessert that my daughter selected. Food was fantastic--cheesy garlic bread to die for, meatballs yummy, eggplant parm and dad's bucatini great. Flatbread pizza wonderful too. Portions are very generous. Several people had chicken piccata or chicken marsala and said there was too much chicken but that's a good thing! Had cannoli and warm nutella cake for dessert--great!

Now my concerns---service left a lot to be desired starting with the bar. We arrived early and had drinks then were ready to move to dinner but the bar made a huge thing of needing to close out our tab there first (3 drinks, one of which was a happy hour drink, so not a big tab!). Okay that's fine but then it took forever to get the waitress to come so we could close out. Not good.... and then at our table the waiter was very nice (Rocko) but not very efficient nor was his helper. We had to ask for olive oil and vinegar for the bread and they brought one for the table of 6 so we asked for another and never got it. Later in the evening we asked for two decaff coffees and those never came. 

We were not in a hurry so it was fine but they need to look into these issues. Would definitely go back for the great food!"}
{"text":"The most uncomfortable, worst dining experience I've ever had. 

We (a group of 4) were seated in the \"lounge\" area near the bar because they didn't have any regular tables available. It was like sitting at a coffee table to eat dinner. Between that and the giant  LED screen outside the window blinding half of our party, it was quite uncomfortable. We were there a good 20 minutes before the waiter came to take our drink orders and it went downhill from there. 

The garlic bread was disgusting, and the chicken parm tasted like a frozen TV dinner. 

And that brings us to the service... Our waiter was the rudest server I have ever had. I was on a business trip and needed to have the checks split, which took him 3 tries and about 25 minutes to get right. Then, when he didn't bring me an itemized receipt (which I need for business trip expenses), I asked for one and the reaction I received was rolled eyes and gritted teeth. He did eventually bring it, but it was served with a lot of unnecessary attitude. 

I would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! My wife is a HUGE fan of cake boss we have been to Buddy's cake shop in Hoboken and she has been to a decorating class at Lackawanna, so Buddy V's was next on her list. She made a reservation for a Sunday night lucky as they were really busy. We were seated within 5 mins of arrival at a table beside the kitchen, within 2 mins our waiter came over to offer us a quieter table in the corner near the window and had our drinks within 5 mins. I ordered caesars salad for appetiser my wife had Grandmas meatballs, both meals were amazing you could see the herbs in the meatballs and the flavour was incredible, my Caesars salad was fresh and croutons were not to crunchy but fresh. We ordered off a theatre special menu which was $38 each for a 3 course meal which we thought was pretty cheap ( being from Australia its hard to find an entree for around that price so this was cheap for us). My Entree was chicken parma and my wife had Buddy SNR Bucatini carbonara, dessert was Nutella cake and a cannoli which we took desserts back to hotel room as we were full from our mains. All in all this restaurant was AMAZEBALLS  we will be returning again in the future and to top it off we went to Carlos bakery  right across from the restaurant.

Beware alcohol is pricey....

BONUS our waiter looked like THE ROCK!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Food was some of the best Italian we've had, Krystal took great care of us, price was unexpectedly reasonable and atmosphere/music was enjoyable. Will come back."}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back tomorrow!   Michele, Adam and the entire staff are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Incredible food. Amazing sauce. Our server was Mourad, and he was so knowledgeable about the restaurant and it's history.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Lasagna was great , caesar salad had these incredible croutons made from polenta. Service staff was really great but our waiter was pushy and a little rude. Kept trying to force us to have the family meal, when we declined dessert he kept telling us full or not we had to have it. When one of the kids asked about a dish he told them when he was young you ate what was put in front of you and explained to us how we care to much what they (children) think. Overall food and atmosphere was great ...maybe we just weren't getting the waiters spence of humor."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS RESTRAUNT!  Food was so delicious, and the waiters/waitresses were super nice and helpful.  Was great for lunch and dont get me started on the canoli's....  DELISH!  I will deffinately be returning!"}
{"text":"Buddy V's was fantastic!  We had the meatballs, grilled octopus, salami and cheese plate, osso buco, veal parm chop and the \"lobster\" for dessert.  Great service, no wait with reservations!  Will return!  We live in Vegas and some strip restaurants are over rated.  However I do recommend Buddy's!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the chicken parm and lasagna, he said it was one of the best if not the best chicken parm he'd ever had, and I absolutely loved the lasagna. And we both agree the Nutella cake and salted caramel ice cream is up there with one of the top desserts we've ever had. And our waiter Giorgio was wonderful he took care of us with a great friendly smile and personality."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere, great food, service was great, a little over priced, but it is Vegas. I had the shrimp scampi and he had the lasagna, both were excellent! We decided we would definitely come back here again but maybe only once in a great while."}
{"text":"Best service ever. They treat you like family. And the food is to die for. It's amazing all the way from the antipastos to the main entree. So so delicious."}
{"text":"I had very bad experience here. The price is a little bit high?but it tastes good. The most worst things that I want to say is the poor serice. The serious woman waiter wrote the final total payment for me and asked me to sign my name. She wrote 25% tips for me and she did not even smile to me. Maybe I look like Asian and she think that I would never come here twice. After she asked me to sign my name for paying?she just left and did not give me a chance to ask her the question. Maybe I look young and Asian. I am studying in America and I just finished my final. I want to have great time in Las vegas?but this experience really made me upset. I just want to share my true experience here. I would never come here again. Thank you."}
{"text":"what an amazing dinner and unexpected surprise!!!  I took my wife here for her birthday thinking what else than the \"Cake  Boss\" can suffice for her birthday celebration.  We were seated and after a few minutes our server Georgio approached our table.  unbelievably upbeat and personable.  We were blown away by his descriptions of the menu items and took his recommendations wholeheartedly, and it was amazing.  His table service was incredible while making us laugh the WHOLE time!!  At the end he sang to my wife in Italian as she sat there ready to burst with tears of joy.  By far more memorable than her last birthday where we spent 3 times the amount and half the quality of food and service.  Thank you for the super memorable night Georgio and the Buddy V staff.....The Klausberg Family"}
{"text":"Being a spaghetti lover, I naturally wanted to try Buddy V's. My fiance and I were able to be seated right away without a reservation, but we did go on a Monday evening so that may be why. I wish we were seated at another table because the waitress we had got on our nerves. My fiance and I do not drink, so when asked if we wanted any alcoholic drinks, we declined. Our waitress looked at us like we were from outer space and make little comments the rest of the night about us not having a drink or two. I thought it was very rude of her to do so. The food was tasteful, but slightly expensive for what you get. I've had spaghetti that's been more flavorful before, but the garlic bread was out-of-this-world good. The atmosphere is calm and the decor is very nice. Overall, I would eat at Buddy V's again, but would order something different than spaghetti."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised tonight!  Everything about our time here truly couldn't have been any better!  We were greeted by the hostess and only waited a few min to be seated for our reservation.  Peter, our server came right over and took our drink order - he was awesome!  He helped me choose my entree, the seared scallops ... which were beyond incredible.  They were served with polenta and shrimp - it was all cooked perfectly.  Polenta was creamy and a fantastic side with the scallops and shrimp.  The sear on the scallop was just right ~ they were tender and very fresh.  For dessert I decided on the butterscotch creme brûlée - again, it was beyond perfect!  Holy cow!  Creamy, rich, just enough butterscotch flavor and the caramelized sugar on top with the pecan short bread cookies... I just couldn't stop eating-even after I was full!  The manager stopped by our table - she thanked us for being there and asked if there was anything we needed or had questions about.  Peter was attentive without being intrusive - he was well versed in all aspects of the menu from starters to drinks to desserts.  I am already excited to plan my next trip here."}
{"text":"FYI - this restaurant is across from Carlos' Bakery. I made a reservation for dinner beforehand. Pros... Super friendly service, great ambiance, and the food was tasteful (the cheese ravioli = yummy)! The only slight complaint: the server picked up my friend's unfinished plate too early and didn't bother to ask if she wanted to take it to-go (she's a local). Anyway, I must return for the Italian Birthday Cake!"}
{"text":"Really good Italian food. My kids loved it especially the view of the city we got. We waited for almost an hour for our table but that's our fault for not making reservations. Waiter was very kind but didn't come as much as I'd like. I kept running out of beer and would have gotten more than two if he had came by more. Their grilled octopus was great and the Sunday gravy was pretty good."}
{"text":"Omg YUM. This place is so good. Perfectly cooked pasta. Fresh Cesar salads with homemade croutons. The decor is adorable and the service is wonderful. Not overly expensive either. Then you can go across the walkway and get homemade desserts from Carlos Bakery. I wish we had Buddy V's in So. Cal!"}
{"text":"Truly the best Sunday Gravy I've had in awhile!  Would highly recommend their food to anyone.  They even beat out that 3 star Michelin chef Gordon Ramsey!"}
{"text":"We showed up for a snack just as happy hour started. The waitress really sold us on the sangria, but it ended up tasting pretty bitter. 
The gnocchi was weird. Very bread-like, not your typical starchy pasta. The taste was forgettable. 
The wife thought the mac&cheese carbonara just tasted like bacon, but the other two at our table thought it was great (maybe they just like bacon lol).
And the sliders were pretty normal. Nothing to write home about. 
I found it weird that the happy hour specials were only available in the lounge. Maybe that's normal in Las Vegas/America but it caught us off guard."}
{"text":"Restaurant week provided the perfect excuse to try Buddy V's. We dined with a group of nine. Service was a bit sluggish at times, but otherwise attentive. They started us with delicious herbed focaccia which paired well with oil and vinegar. I only wish they left the bottles on the table so we could help ourselves. We didn't know upon ordering, but draft beers in the 20 oz and Liter sizes come in a souvenir glass with $9 refills (the cost of a pint). So, that was a nice surprise when ordering a second round. 

The restaurant week menu is $40.15 and it came with choice of appetizer, entree and dessert. The majority of the table ordered Grandma's Meatballs, made with beef, veal and pork. They were tender and juicy, the marinara sauce was nicely balanced and flavorful. I was quite pleased. Likely, the second best meatball in town. Those that had the Panzanella Salad seemed satisfied, the mozzarella was very fresh. 

The table tried each available entree: Pasta Bolognese, Sea Bass, Carbonara, and Chicken Parmesan. Each were beautifully prepared and damn tasty. My Sea Bass was perfectly seasoned and brightened with a spritz of lemon, the side salad was fresh and light, which was welcomed since I was already pretty full. The chicken parm came with a nice helping of pasta and two lightly breaded baked cutlets topped with mozzarella and provolone cheeses. The pasta across the board was the ideal al dente. 

And for dessert we had a choice of tiramisu or cannoli. Both were well executed and scrumptious. I loved dipping the lady fingers into the layers of the creamy tiramisu. The cannoli was filled end to end with sweet ricotta; no hollow center. 

I was a little skeptical, but dinner was delicious. Many celebrity chef restaurants fail to deliver, but that's not the case here. It has good eats and casual charm. If you have the opportunity, there's still time to check out the restaurant week menu which is an absolute steal. It's well worth navigating the labyrinth that is the Venetian. Don't park at Venetian like we did, I believe Palazzo self parking would provide better access."}
{"text":"Second time here for another visit to vegas, and I absolutely love this place!  The portions are huge (the first time there was just too much leftovers), so order an entree per person if you really want to stuff yourselves.  Be sure to save room for dessert.  The tiramisu is very unique and not too sweet -- perfect for me, maybe for you?"}
{"text":"I visited Buddy V's not too Iong ago and this is what I thought...

Pros: friendly service, family friendly, big portions, great prices and live band playing while you dine...

Cons: Few items on menu and long wait...


However, Buddy V's is highly recommended and a must go to restaurant when visiting Las Vegas. Buddy V's is located in the Venetian. FYI...I always back up my reviews with pictures...the dishes in the pictures are the surf and turf and lasagna."}
{"text":"Everything was like eating at mommom sophie's. From the chopped salad to the garlic bread and bowls of fresh made meatballs!  Recommend it to anyone!  And im going across to carlo's bake shop for a cup cake!"}
{"text":"This is a good plan to take the family for grub. Typical American version of Italian food, nothing special. Would have preferred bread with linguini and clams over breadsticks. Decent liguini dish but nothing to be wowed about."}
{"text":"As I am a big fan of Cake Boss, I was looking forward to dinner at Buddy V's Ristorante. This is a family restaurant in Venetian. So  I gave it a try.

I ordered Margarita pizza, Cesar Salad and Garlic bread. The pizza was not good for me. It was not what I expected from Italian pizza and was expensive for its size. The Cesar Salad was not bad though. It was with warm, chewy croutons, with a hint of fennel in the salad and plenty of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. The garlic bread was not bad either. 

Overall, not bad, but there are a lot of better restaurants in the town with this price range."}
{"text":"All the servers were excellent I believe the main servers name was Gianni but his two helpers and the hostesses were fantastic too. This is one of my new favorite restaurants. I have to drink tonic water for my leg cramps and they made sure my glass was never empty. Also the main server recommended a fantastic drink we enjoyed every moment of the evening. Great job and the service was second to none."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Some of the best Italian food I've ever had !! from start to finish service was amazing and the food was worth every part of the 5 stars. I would definitely come back here again and recommend it to friends"}
{"text":"Wow. I was wondering if Buddy Valastro was going to be a sell out by lending his name to restaurants and bakeries across the US. I can definitely say no. I judge Italian restaurants by their sauce and their meatballs. I know both being from the Philly/NJ/NY area. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. I was served a very generous, steaming portion. The presentation was lovely. It was very fresh. The meatballs were outstanding. Firm, flavorful and delicious. The spaghetti was perfectly al dente, and the sauce was as if it came from an Italian grandmother's kitchen. The service was very very good. Friendly, knowledgable and attentive to any need. Bravo Buddy Valastro!"}
{"text":"Second time going to Buddy's this year. Both times the food and service were great. Went for lunch and the menu isn't huge but the meals were great. Had their meatball sub (meatballs were great!) and their chicken sandwich and we really liked both. Finished it off with a cannoli - lets just say you can tell why he's famous for his cannolis."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Pasta, salads, appetizers and bread  all yummy!!! Service was so so. Bakery had a small line. But worth the wait for all the goodies."}
{"text":"Did enjoy my food with the exception of the chicken parmigans burnt ends. Luckily portion was a good serving that I didn't feel that I was robbed of my meal will go again likely to try another menu item."}
{"text":"The food was great. Had the chicken a la Vodka, Panzanella, bruschetta, carbonara Mac n cheese, and a lobster tail to finish things off. Food wasn't really bland as a prior review said. The apps needed a little salt, but all else was good. Service was great and not slow as mentioned in other reviews. Prices are reasonable and portions aren't gargantuan so you have some room for desert. Very neat place and I'd go again for sure. The wife liked it as well. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if it was an option."}
{"text":"AMAZING! This place is delicious. The service is fantastic. And you have to try the CANNOLIS! I had the chicken parm for dinner and it is easily a plate for two; you will not leave there hungry. At. All. 10/10"}
{"text":"Overall the food was good, the service was friendly, but a bit bumpy and the wine was disappointing.  
For appetizers, we shared the mac & cheese, salumi and mozzarella en carozza.  These were all solid dishes, with the mozzarella probably being my favorite.  Our entrees were brought out before we were even half way through the appetizers, but when I said something they took them away.  I was a little worried that our meals would be sitting under a heat lamp, but kudos to the staff for bringing us fresh dishes when the time came.
I thought the wine list was rather lame.  I like wine, but am not an expert, so when I recognize a bunch of the wines as the variety I can find at my local Smith's, I am a bit let down.  I finally ordered a bottle of an Italian variety I liked, but when it came time for the sample taste I was almost tempted to refuse it.  It wasn't spoiled, but sure did taste as though it had been stored at the wrong temperature.
For entrees, we tried the lasagne, Dad's Bucatini and spaghetti and meatballs.  Again, all the dishes were good.  I especially loved the Bucatini and would get it again.  Desserts were not quite as good as I expected.  The cannoli were fresh, but the filling was lighter than the ricotta I expected and overall had a strong cinnamon oil taste.  The Nutella cake was your standard lava cake that has been around since the 80s.  The coffee was nice and strong."}
{"text":"Our initial plan was to stop by Carlos' Bakery at Venetian, buy some cannoli and leave. However the line was kind of long and we decided just to have an early dinner at Buddy V's cross the hall and get the deserts at the restaurant.

The hostess was courteous and the waitress was very nice. We ordered Calamari appetizer, clam linguini and mac & cheese. Linguini was al dente and kids liked the mac & cheese. But the deserts were the reason we stopped by. We ordered cannoli and lobster tail. Sure they did not disappoint, the cannoli's filling was fresh and crust was crispy. The lobster tail's skin was crunch and filling goes very well with the fresh fruits. 
The price was the average Las Vegas casino meal price and the overall it was pretty good dining experience."}

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Gr8 restaurant hidden away in the Venetian. Went for lunch and service was fast and friendly. Ordered the chicken parm and it was awesome!! Not the biggest portion of pasta but more than enough chicken. Didn't make it to the pastry side but it was very busy over there. Def will go again."}
{"text":"We sat at the Bar and the 2 men Group   Nick and Howie play awesome music.  Kathy the bartender has a great attitude and a full time smile. We had tapas at the bar great calamari.      Nice ambiance. Ra ra ra"}
{"text":"Great food, poor service.  Sunday gravy was delicious and loved the piccata.  Birthday cake, cannoli, and lobster tail were on point.  The beef tenderloin was on the rare side for a medium.  Kudos to the kitchen.

For the service, I'll keep it short. Just our luck as first time diners to get the waitress in training on a Saturday night.  It would have been tolerable if she had any personality or acted if she even cared about our experience there.  Never engaged us, we had to continually ask for refills on water,  and brought me the wrong drink.  Trainer right at her side, for what? I blame the management and trainer for this.   Servers in training should be up to speed for the weekend dinner service before being put there.  When customers leave satisfied with the food but disgruntled over the service after paying nearly three bills for a mediocre dining experience, you end up losing a repeat customer.  

You want great reviews and repeat business? Then don't use the trial by fire method with new servers and send them to charm school first."}
{"text":"A client lunch with great food and conversation. Give this establishment a try when in Las Vegas. 

Had the salad with shrimp. Was fresh, fast, and tasty. Great service and staff was attentive. 

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was courteous, fast, and friendly. An even better bonus: Buddy himself was there that day to film for his show! He stopped by every table to greet everyone, ask how the food was, and to take pictures. The sangria was great, as were the panzanella, meatball sub, and canolis. Not saying this because we met Buddy, as I already formed my opinion on the food before we met him. Great experience, and I would definitely recommend if you're on the strip in Vegas."}
{"text":"We recently visited Buddy V's before seeing a show on a Saturday. The restaurant didn't seem too busy for a Saturday night, the view was pretty nice as the sun was setting. The noise level was a little high and we weren't thrilled by the seating. A lot of the tables were up against a very long bench seat which they all shared. This created a situation where we felt like we were having dinner with the two sets of people on each side of us.

Our waitress wasn't too attentive, but our bus boy was pretty awesome! The food was really good and the potion size was huge. After eating my lasagne it looked as if I didn't even touch it. 

The most awesome part was the dessert... I love canolis! They were fabulous!! Perfect hint of cinnamon in the pastry and super yummy cream! My husband has the tiramisu which he said was also great."}
{"text":"Not the greatest... Back to the basics!
I was told the there was a steak/arugula salad as an option for dinner. I am not a fan of arugula, so I asked to have it on romaine (as they had a Caesar salad on the menu).  He asked the chef and the chef said no. I then said, can you just give me the Caesar salad and place a filet on it. He said sure. The entree came as follows... One plate with a filet (6oz) and one small bowl of Caesar salad. I asked what is this??? The server proceeded to tell me that the chef did not think a filet would go nicely on a Caesar. I told the server that I ordered the meal and not him. This really frustrates me. Cater to the customer, especially when this is a middle of the road restaurant. I also had (2) vodka and soda with a lime. The third one came with lemon. I asked why and where was my lemon. The server said that he did not want the drinks messed up? What?!? This place needs some flavor added to the meals, re-training of the staff and the chef to have a new attitude. I miss the First!!! The First was the restaurant prior."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here last night and let me say..it was perfect!. We did make reservations even on a Tuesday because we had theatre tickets and did not wanna be late. We asked to sit at a booth by the window but was informed that was for guests with a party of 6 but she did seat us at another booth that was smaller. Ok no big.
 Our waiter was excellent and very prompt! His name was Chaz according to the ticket. Great service, very knowledgeable about the menu and had great recommendations. He also never let our drinks get very low because he was bringing out a fresh one which I feel is hard for other servers to do anymore. I opted for the Margherita pizza while my mom got the Shrimp Scampi. While waiting they had fresh bread that just came out of the oven and was delicious.
 Our food was great and looked good too :) they also start live music at 530 so that was a nice touch. After we were stuffed from dinner we had to look at the dessert menu because let's face it it's Buddys! The dessert menu had pictures of Buddy and his family which was a wonderful touch! We ordered Lisa's nutella cake and holy crap it was heavenly! I highly recommend it.

All in all we had a great experience and would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Buddy's but not a fan of Buddy Vs... over priced for mediocre food... the highlight was the garlic bread...spaghetti was runny... pizza was a little too hard... hopefully Carlos bakery will be better... stick to what you know Buddy. .."}
{"text":"We had a the tomato soup which was absolutely delicious, and Aunt something's bread and cheese thing. The bread and cheese thing was good but not great. The drink were very good as well. One of us had a steak, which was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. The other, got a Margherita pizza which honestly kind of spoiled the whole meal. The dough was meh, and the toppings were almost non existent. Only about 20% of the pizza had cheese on it, there were 3-4 tomato slices and basil leaves spread across the 8 slices. The worst thing however was the sauce, my first impression when I tasted it was that they had used sewer water and canned tomatoes to make. The whole thing was soggy with this sauce, which was simply gross. It's a shame, because the rest of the meal was great :/"}
{"text":"Went to happy hour and sat in the bar. The staff was nice but there was confusion about getting the happy hour menu. Ordered drinks and watched them sitting on the bar until I got up to get them. 

Finally spoke to the assistant general manager, Adam who listened to our concerns & he was kind enough to buy us a second round of cocktails. Service suddenly approved dramatically. The meatball sliders were fabulous & the drinks generous. 

No place is perfect, but I respect a place that goes out of its way to make things right. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"The best chicken parm there is! And their cannolis are so delicious. You must eat here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the food was not great either. I would be happier grabbing some burgers and fries at In-N-Out instead of this crap."}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch and it was perfect. Had the mozzarella bread for starters and the chicken parm for the meal. We added some meatballs to it and it was out of this world."}
{"text":"The food was great. I had the cheese ravioli with chicken added. It came within 10 minutes and was amazing! Our waiter was also friendly. He made sure we had everything we needed! Great cheese bread with vinegar and oil before the meal!"}
{"text":"All I can say is the best!!
Lasagna is bomb!!! Spaghetti is perfect no to saucy but just right!!!
Lobster tail and cannoli are sooooooo goooood!!
I wish there was in LA!!!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here early on a Sunday evening. Get here early enough and you can snag one of the tables overlooking the strip.

I had the \"Sunday Gravy\" which is a variety of things - sausage, meatballs, lamb, etc. served with pasta and red sauce. Great dish and very filling. Dining companion enjoyed her chicken parm. Pricing is reasonable for the strip, but obviously you can get cheaper Italian food in a locals restaurant. Service was good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars as the food was great and service was outstanding but while eating my linguini and clams I bit into sand in my clams. Clams need to be cleaned better.
The garlic toast was awesome. Caprese salad is a must. Overall great place to eat."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here last weekend. The service was outstanding and the good was good too. The Focaccia bread they serve for their bread service was moist and flavorful. I took our server's suggestion and ordered the Chicken Parm dinner. The pasta was good but not great. The chicken however was cooked perfectly. I would certainly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a new place for Italian in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had!  The sauce tasted just like my grandmas. Almost like she was in the back making it!  The atmosphere is fun. We didn't order drinks because we're recovering from the previous night but the bread to the entree was delicious! Would definitely return when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"First thing first - Standout dishes:

- Buddy's Caprese: I am normally not a fan of Caprese salads, but Buddy really nails this one. High quality ingredients, and finely tuned flavors make this a worthwhile starter.

- Cheese Ravioli: I know what you're thinking. \"I can get cheese ravioli anywhere.\" Yes, you can. The great thing about the ravioli at Buddy V's, however, is that it is a perfect companion to Buddy's outstanding roasted tomato sauce. It's bright, tangy, smooth, and well rounded all at the same time. Definitely memorable fare.

- Cannoli: I am normally not what you would call a \"fan\" of cannoli, but, once again, Buddy has proved me wrong. Most cannoli, in my experience, are disappointing in their grainy, and under-sweetened filling. Not so with these cannoli. Perfectly sweetened, incredibly smooth filling paired with just the right amount of cinnamon in the pastry make these cannoli worth writing home about. (Added perk: After eating at Buddy V's, you can walk right across the hall, and buy a whole box of cannoli from Carlo's Bakery to eat back at the hotel if you are so inclined.)

Now, to business. There is definitely no shortage of Italian food on the Las Vegas Strip, but Buddy V's is definitely a major standout. Even among all of the other celebrity chef restaurants to be found in Vegas, the Cake Boss is definitely holding his own.

My wife and I stopped by for lunch one afternoon, and had a great time. Our experience was so good, though, that we went back for dinner two days later. For lunch we just stopped by, but for dinner we made reservations through OpenTable. Neither time was the place so busy one would need reservations in order to avoid a wait, however.

Here are some highlights of Buddy V's worth noting:

- The service at Buddy V's is excellent. They are easily on par with restaurants with much higher price points.

- Having worked in food service, I am hyper-sensitive about cleanliness. I had absolutely no complaints here, however. The entire restaurant is very clean, comfortable, and inviting.

- The pricing of most menu items is very reasonable in comparison with many similar Vegas eateries.

- The whiskey/scotch selection at Buddy V's bar is truly impressive. It's not hard to find a bar that serves Johnnie Walker Black anywhere, but one that serves Johnnie Walker Green, Gold, and Blue is tough to find at any price point.

- Unlike most restaurants in the Venetian, Buddy V's is right near an entrance making it an easy place to duck in for a meal without having to stray too far from the strip.

Final pro tip: Be sure to note on your reservation that you are celebrating a birthday, if that is the case. They have some fun, no-loud-obnoxious-singing-involved surprises for birthday-folk. I would imagine the same is true for most other celebrations as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I were dying to go to Buddy's new place in Vegas. So I made reservations ahead of time and couldn't wait. We went earlier in the day just so we could know where in the mall it was located. I'm glad we did since it was off a corridor from the main forum shops. We liked how the place looked. Well set up and inviting. They had a long row of outside tables in front of the restaurant. 

So we go to the place and they found our reservation and went to seat us. They brought us into the bar and sat us in the corner with a view of the strip. I didn't mind the view but if I made reservations why was I sitting at the bar? Kinda of set the mode already. It was not to crowded for a Friday night which we were very surprised when most restaurants are hopping. There were bread stick on the table already but they were prepackaged ones and not from Italy, they were made in New Jersey. 

We wanted the best from Buddy so my wife ordered his wife's linguine and clam sauce. While I had Buddy's chicken rigatoni \"ALLA VODKA\". My wife's meal was plain and not worth the $26 that they charged for it. It tasted like my wife made it herself nothing fancy or fantastic taste. Mine had maybe 6 pieces of chicken in it and the pasta was kind of chewy. It was like my wife made it also. Not saying I wouldn't eat it but not real fine dining. We have been to several restaurants in Vegas since we go 4-6 times a year. So I'm no newbie. 

Oh I missed the garlic bread we ordered before the meal. Which consisted of three pieces for 9. Nothing special and little over priced again. My wife and I agreed Buddy should of opened a café type restaurant and not fine dining. The food is more family food but over priced for Vegas. It would be totally packed everyday if the prices were lower and family orientated. 

But not to jam on Buddy over his place. We had the Italian birthday cake and let me tell you it was no disappointment. We loved it and that what Buddy is famous for Cakes. I wish he had a bakery with the restaurant because that would go no stop. Hope this helps you guys out. thanks"}
{"text":"Average food, terrible staff. 
Las Vegas caters to numerous business travelers, yet the staff at Buddy V's couldn't figure out how to provide me with an itemized receipt and seemed bothered by the fact that I even asked for one. They also screwed up a simple request to help me celebrate a team member's birthday. 
Whoever manages that restaurant should find something else to do. Because he or she isn't very good at managing restaurants."}
{"text":"4 stars for food

I had the Chicken Parm/Garlic Bread/Caesar salad

2 stars for service

20 minute wait so we sat at the bar...big mistake, I think they forgot about us or didn't have enough staff

Needless to say, worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"Loved the pasta (tried the ravioli,  carbonara,  and spaghetti).  The bread with olive oil and vinegar was tasty too.  There were tiny sticks on the table too.  I have had better chicken parmesan at Maggianos.  The caeser salad was probably the best I have ever had.  By the time our desert came I was already bursting at the seams....."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. Stopped by for restaurant week $20.18 lunch. Service was great and you can't beat the price for a 3 course meal. Caesar salad was unremarkable but the polenta croutons it was topped with were fantastic! They had a hint of lemon that really made them stand out. The tomato basil soup was also a hit. For entrees we had chicken parm & spaghetti meatballs. The chicken was moist and flavorful as were the meatballs. The pasta was cooked perfect but the sauce was just average. Not something I would want again. We were too full for dessert & got it go. Totally enjoyed it later!! 

I might return for happy hour. I heard they have the croutons as an appetizer on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here on our last night in Vegas and had a great time! The food was soooo good. You won't leave hungry I promise! I'd come back again."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I've ever had in my life. The environment and service is amazing. This is a dinner night my family and I will remember"}
{"text":"Happy hour 4.30-6.30pm 7 days/week offers $5 small plates and $4 prosecco/wine/sangria. 

Recommend: 
- granny meatballs flavorful, smooth, hearty
- calamari crispy yet juicy
- ricotta cheese light, goes well with grilled bread

Ok: 
- sausage pepper sliders"}
{"text":"Since we were in Las Vegas to celebrate my husband's birthday I was in search for a great Italian restaurant, either on The Strip or not far from it. Most of the Italian restaurants we've picked thus far have been quite good.  Buddy V's received great reviews from various sites so we made reservations there and gave it a try.  It exceeded our expectations!

First timers or those not familiar with the location of restaurants in the Grand Canal Shoppes should allow time to navigate.  Buddy V's can be a bit hard to find but worth the search!  Upon entering the restaurant we found the ambiance handsome and comfortable...neither too elegant or casual.  Views of The Strip were an added bonus.   The staff was courteous and efficient.

Being Italian food aficionados, we look for entrees that'd are a flavor-packed indulgence when dining out. We asked to split the Caesar Salad, which was kindly plated on two plates, and very good.  The fresh warm cubes of polenta in place of regular croutons were a tasty option.   The warm bread that came with our meal was also very good. I ordered \"My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara\" and my husband ordered \"Valastro Sunday Gravy\" which includes meatballs, sausage, lamb, pork and a bowl of rigatoni in a delicious red sauce.  Both pasta dishes fulfilled our culinary wishes -- generous portions that were delicious!  (reasonably priced for on the Las Vegas Strip)

One of the reviews I read suggested letting them know if it's your birthday, which we did, and were treated with a delicious dessert with \"Happy Birthday\" drizzled on the plate.  Our meal was excellent from start to finish!"}
{"text":"Just went there and WOW was it good and I mean really good. Me daughter and myself had dinner there. Simple meals but explosive flavor. She had the cheese ravioli and I had the chicken Parmesan with spaghetti. The flavor that burst inside your mouth never stopped. We were pretty much smiling throughout the entire meal. Me beer was cold. Both beers. And the garlic bread appetizer with marinara was the perfect prelude to the entire meal. The service was really nice. We felt comfortably serviced. The environment with the background music selection made you feel like you were at home eating your grandmamas cooking. And they were staffed properly. All very important things to look for. I would put the pricing star to a level three though. Won't be back for awhile but let me say that if you are in Vegas and are looking for some killer fare Buddy V's is a must have. By yourself or with somebody else. DO IT"}
{"text":"Awesome choice for brunch. For buffet brunch and unlimited drinks (beer, mimosa, sangria, bellinis, wine) $50. Doesn't get much better than that. Went for a bachelorette brunch and our service was incredible. Our drinks never got less than half full and he started leaving pitchers on the table for us--truly bottomless. Our server even made us to go cups of our drink of choice!! The brunch itself was excellent, the Mac and cheese was to die for and so was the dessert table. I'll be including Buddy V's for brunch on all my Vegas trips from now on!"}
{"text":"BEST. FOOD. EVER. and the red bull drink is absolutely addicting. I will return to vegas JUST for buddy v's."}
{"text":"Good food, nice presentation, great service even though it was crowded. But truthfully, for what we spent, I expected it to be a little better than it was. Fun to go once, but probably would not go there again!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Buddy V's except that it was absolutely amazing.  My wife and I dined here with my mom and her partner durning a recent trip to Vegas.  We were greeted by a smiling Italian server who explained to us that we could enjoy the food one of two ways.  The first way being just ordering our own thing off the menu and enjoying it like that or secondly we could close our menus sit back and let the restaurant take us on a culinary experience.  We had to go with a culinary experience.  We were amazed.  The firsts course had meatball, calamari a meat and cheese board and a great salad.  Entree was sea bass, chicken and pasta, lasagna and filet and for dessert a Italian cake and their signature lobster tail.  Everything was so good good and service.  Didn't expect a pastry guy to have such good dinner food"}
{"text":"Super disappointed in our recent visit to our once beloved Buddy V's. With so many excellent choices in the Vegas culinary field, it's critical to place the upmost importance on customer service if your intention is to remain relevant, not just a mere tourist destination. As always, the food was delicious, atmosphere beautiful and location perfect. However, the customer service has significantly declined. Our waiter was inattentive, bothered by our request to split the check for a party of eight, less than fourth coming with the cost of a birthday treat for our daughter's 16th celebration, incorrectly calculated our ticket (hopefully in error) and expressed his exasperation in an evident and unappreciated fashion. Sadly, I think we will be forced to expand our Italian palate....."}
{"text":"My little sister watches a lot of Cake Boss, so we decided to come here and try Buddy's restaurant as a treat to her. The place is very family-friendly with a relaxed and cozy ambiance. Food is good, but I wouldn't say it was memorable. My family ordered different dishes (chicken parm, caesar salad, buddy's favorite pizza), and I got to try each of them. They were all good and the portion sizes are great, but they weren't rave-worthy.

The service, however, was fantastic. Our waiter was so friendly and helpful, and we really felt like the restaurant was a cozy, family-oriented establishment. The service really made the whole experience more enjoyable - probably enough to come back a second time when I'm in Vegas again with friends or family."}
{"text":"Great food! This might sound funny but, the croutons on the Caesar salad are to die for. I had the sea bass and it was perfectly not a bone in the fish. My husband had the lasagna and it was a very generous portion and delicious."}
{"text":"Came here this past Sunday night to celebrate my sister's bachelorette event in Vegas. There was 10 of us ladies. I must say the ambiance was relaxing, semi formal-casual. Our server Peter was very attentive to our needs. They gave us this fresh rosemary garlic bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil and it was amazing. We ordered the chicken picatta and added mushrooms and it was quite tasty, chicken marsala, lasagna, linguine with clams, mac and cheese, chicken rigatoni alla vodka, the caprese salad,  caesar salad, and veal marsala. Everything was pleasing to the palate. I also ordered the salted caramel ice cream to go and it was delicious. I would definitely come back here again to get my Italian fix the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"If you know what authentic Italian food is... Don't go to Buddy V's. For $22 each, (lunch special) you can get an appetizer, main, and desert. While the portions are appropriate, the food itself was not. My meatballs (\"grandma's meatballs\" appetizer) were great, they tasted homemade! The \"Spaghetti Bolognese\" was incredibly basic, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the spaghetti noodles were simply basic. The biggest disappointment was the cannoli. Obviously I had high expectations not only because of the price, but because of the insane hype that surrounds this restaurant, because of the fact that it is owned by Buddy Valastro and family, from the show Cake Boss, which regularly features and highlights their cannolis as a staple item. It was so incredibly stale on the outside, I had to literally smack it with my knife to knock a chunk off of it to eat, which would have been okay if it wasn't just a greasy, dried up piece of crust. The filling was sub-par as well, I'd have rather had some cool whip inside there, at least it would be somewhat pleasant. Overall, the food was poor.

Our service was phenomenal, both of our waiters/ servers were very kind, fun, and knowledgeable. 

If you're looking for good food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I teetered between a 3 and 4... the four because the portion size was good (my linguine with calms had clams in the shell AND chopped inside the pasta,) not huge 5 pound plates of pasta; however, spending $26 for a plate of pasta may turn off a lot of customers - but you're in Vegas. A four because my Drago Rosso cocktail was very good, a touch of spice and the mango garnish was delish. Also enjoyed a regular Caesar salad, but the \"croutons\" were actually yummy, warm, cubes of polenta, right on! Now for the \"eh...\" Sunday gravy plate - loved meat variety, but couldn't look over salty sauce. Service was okay, couldn't find her half the time, but when she was there she was attentive and kind, without being over the top. Lastly, I made a reservation, confirmed the next day, and when I showed up at five 'till then said they couldn't find it. A 4 because they said they'd sit us anyway, and we did within 5 minutes, but how do you lose my reservation? Doesn't make me feel like my time was worth it to you if you can't even find my name in your records. Will come back, because that was my second visit and I craved to go back last night. But I will be more open to try a new restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Great food an great service.  Had the meatball sub  and ny friend had the bolognese pasta.  And Danielle was great!"}
{"text":"Delicious Sunday Brunch! Be sure to try the meatballs and Italian Sausage. Decor is simple, but well done and the food is home style, simple, but perfectly executed. ONLY because it has the CAKE BOSS name attached to it - dessert could have been a wider selection."}
{"text":"We stopped in and found out they had a Happy Hour Menu with small bites for $5. Must have is the Mac and Cheese. Very very flavorful, creamy and oh so DELISH!!! The peas were perfect and POPPED in your mouth. The panchetta was a perfect contrast to the silky smooth sauce and the crunchy bread crumb top provided a great texture to the top. The meatballs were fantastic and the bread with ricotta cheese was fantastic. Ask for Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar on the side. I ordered a melon martini off the drink menu. It was light, bright and strong! Had a wonderful bit of mint and citrus zest throughout. Lastly we rounded out the dinner with the Nutella Cake!! Oh my GOSH!!! I am not a BIG fan on Nutella and ate around the dollop in the center. The cake was extremely moist! The Salted Carmel ice cream that is made in house at their other restaurant was SUPERB!!! Loved the peanut brittle on the bottom. Try each one seperate and after all together you will NOT be disappointed! We sat in the bar by the window and the view was great. Loved the decor with the rolling pins hanging throughout and HUGE beaters mixed in with the lights. We had a great night! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So this is going to be a bit of a longer review covering so much. 

Ambiance:
This restaurant has an incredible energy! I love the display kitchen. So you will see everything being made and exiting the kitchen, if you are near the kitchen. 

Food:
Honestly this menu is one of the best menus. It offers everything from pasta, pizzas, burgers, and everything in between. The quality is incredible too! The chefs have an incredible sense of what flavors go together. 

Service: 
The initial welcome from the host was incredible! She greeted me and inquired about anything that I am celebrating. She then very politely showed us to the table. Now my waitress was a different story. She greeted us nicely at the beginning. However she made us feel very rushed! Like the restaurant was not busy, why are you rushing us? Like her first question wasn't for drinks but rather food we want. Then when we ordered drinks we never got refills on our water until our food came out. Once we finished the main entree, she was quick to try to give us the check until she remembered we are celebrating a birthday. Overall I'm disappointed in the service. 

I still give this 4 stars because it was a great restaurant but had a few bad staff members. Overall I would return but I hope I receive better service next time."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Slow bar service to table. Slow service for check to table."}
{"text":"We ate dinner last night before the George Strait concert, the restaurant is very well decorated and has a nice ambience.  

The service was outstanding, my wife had the ravioli and she did the marinara was very good.  I had the carbonara and it was excellent.  

I would definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting a great dinner for a decent price."}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews and liking the proximity to our room at the Venetian, I made a dinner reservation here.  We were a little late because we kept getting lost in the maze of the canal shops, but they accommodated us without any problems.  We were seated by the window in the bar area.  Nice view of the strip below, but it was so loud.  Music was already playing at a loud volume, and then it seemed as if they turned it up even more.  So no dinner conversation for us.  We only like to yell at each other when we're angry.  

Lots of choices on the menu, and I almost got meatballs, but I decided to try something else.  The menu had a prix fixed dinner that included a starter, an entree, and a dessert.  So we went with that.  Our starters were the Panzanella salad, and we were served a warm piece of focaccia style bread.  The salad was different than we expected--it contained a lot of greens--but it was still very delicious with fresh buffalo mozzarella and excellent croutons.  My entree was the orecchiette with sausage.  It also contained broccolini and roasted tomatoes.  It was tasty and super satisfying.  My husband's entree was the steak pizzaiolo and it was served with a side of polenta.  It looked good, but my husband was not happy with it.  Difficult to get a steak cooked to his liking outside a steak house.  For dessert, we both chose cannoli.  Very pretty and extremely sweet.  Served with warm chocolate sauce--this part was pretty amazing!  I really enjoyed my food, but it's way too loud inside."}
{"text":"My husband and I come to Vegas often and have been wanting to try this restaurant. Walking towards this place you could smell the aroma of garlic! 
We were seated within minutes and had a great waiter. Wish I could remember his name. He was very friendly and accommodating. He recommended great dishes. We ordered a variety of different foods which were all delicious. 
We sat in a comfortable booth overlooking the whole restaurant and enjoyed watching the chefs cook while we ate. Overall, a great place to eat. Great service, great food. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Make reservations if you want to sit at a real table. We had to sit in the lounge at a high top - not ideal for dinner due to the lack of space. I had the Mac n Cheese Carbonara - delicious, creamy, smoky flavor. Despite sitting in the lounge, they served the full menu and the food was out almost instantly. Great prices for Vegas. Fun eclectic modern decor. Try to get there from 4:30-6:30 for happy hour on appetizers and drinks! I enjoyed a $4 Sangria."}
{"text":"We are back!!! Express lunch was delish as usual. We shared meatballs and caesar salad (love polenta croutons!) Carbonara hands down....they kill it here! Just wish they served bread or soft breadsticks instead if crunchy packaged sticks...Buddy V is a \"baker\" after all. Need to wipe the sauce off the plate. A tiramasu and canoli to hold us over until next time.
CIAO!"}
{"text":"Took the family for lunch as a Christmas treat. Service was good, especially friendly even with three small children including accommodating special requests. We tried the calamari, meatballs, Hoboken chopped salad, carbonara, kids Mac and Cheese and pizza. For dessert we had cannoli, nutella chocolate cake and Cheese & Cake. First, the Nutella Cake is insanely amazing! Everything else was very good as well. Honestly their kids Mac and Cheese was one of all our favorites! It should be available for adults. The meatballs were prefect. Loved the flavor combination of the chopped salad but my 19 year old daughter who likes things simple, thought it was too much. The cheese & Cake, a take on cheesecake was good not super sweet but definitely not the top choice of the three we got."}
{"text":"Good buffet. There wasn't a lot of food but the dishes there were above expectations for a buffet. It is worth the price and especially bottomless drinks, alcohol (almost said alcoholic which is how I'm feeling after 4 days in Vegas lol) is worth the $16.99 price."}
{"text":"Very good Italian restaurant. Great ambience. I got the shrimp pasta and shrimp really big.  It is a little pricey but to be expected for the Venetian. Very romantic setting with fresh food.  House made focaccia bread is a must. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Attempted to come here once and couldn't get a reservation.

Second time around was able to get one. 

Place  is very nice and clean. Menu is pretty extensive and you can find most something for everyone, however is a little pricey. I had the eggplant appetizer (for an entree) and was very pleased. The bread they bring your table is addictive it's so good! Service was great. 

Deserts were kind of a let down. I tried the Nutella cake and was kind of let down for the $10 you pay for it. Seemed kind of small and didnt really taste much like Nutella. I was disappointed as buddy is known for his amazing over the top deserts."}
{"text":"The garlic bread appetizer is the best garlic bread ever, hands down. I had the rigatoni alla vodka and my fiancé had the lasagna. Both very good. We also shared the Nutella chocolate cake which was every bite as amazing as it sounds. 
The service was wonderful. As silly as this sounds, my glass was never empty. It drives me nuts when I have to ask for a refill so to have someone always on top of it was wonderful. The waitress did a few weird things like take the drink menu away as soon as we order the first round but otherwise she was wonderful."}
{"text":"Buddy V's place , after watching cake boss I had to try this place on my visit to Vegas and I am glad I did :)

We ordered :
Ice tea : refreshing
Vegetarian Pasta: one of the best I have had till date 
Eggplant parmigiana :  super yum ! 

Service : 5/5
Food : 5/5

Only regret I have is I didn't try the dessert , will have to come back for that :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian food I've ever had! Makes me curious about the bakery now, the lasagna is a must have."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Came here on a Sunday with a girlfriend and we both loved the food.

We were running a bit late so we called the restaurant and they were so nice and had no issues pushing our reservation back by about 15 minutes.

Once seated we ordered some wine and sparkling water. I know this is something very minor but I loved that the sparkling water was nice and cold -- you'd be surprised how many restaurants give it at room temperature. We immediately ordered entrees and I ordered the Chicken Rigatoni Alla Vodka and my friend ordered the Bucatini Carbonara. Both of them were so so good. My Rigatoni had just the right amount of sauce and it was incredibly flavorful and they gave Parmesan cheese and red chili flakes on top and that just added the perfect touch. I had a few bites of my friends Bucatini and it was so delicious -- usually restaurants use spaghetti to make Carbonara but using Bucatini was such a great touch. I love that the egg was mixed perfectly in without scrambling it. My only regret is that I wish we had been more hungry to eat more!

I've tried A LOT of restaurants in Vegas but this is one where I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"My wife loves Creme Brulee.  She has it at any restaurant that serves it.  I like Creme Brulee.  My wife likes butterscotch.  For me is butterscotch is just ok.   Who would have ever thought we would both love the Buddy V's Butterscotch Creme Brulee so much we have it every time we are in Vegas.  Multiple times!   Now Creme Brulee at other restaurants just doesn't quite measure up.  The Grandma's Meatballs are also the best I have ever had.  The Mediterranean Sea Bass was good.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Poor service, mediocre food. With so many options in Vegas, there are many better choices"}
{"text":"Surprisingly fantastic.  I was skeptical since Buddy is not only a TV chef, but one known for cakes and pastries.  I'm glad I gave this place a try though.  It was fantastic.  The food was well above average, and greatly helped by more than reasonable pricing.  Generous portions too.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  I'm hard-pressed to think of a better meal on the strip that's in at-all the same price range (dinner for two came to under $100)"}
{"text":"Casual place. Smells are fantastic. We sat at a window and had a nice view of the strip. Eats okay. Had the veal marsala. I hate to say it, but it is true, this doesnt hold a candle to the same dish at Caraba's."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant on the strip so far-the orecchiette pasta with Italian sausage was great"}
{"text":"great service! - we told our waiter we were running late for the blue man group show and she was able to get our food out very quickly! 
the my mother in laws shrimp scampi was great. DEFINITELY get the garlic bread! so delicious. and the meatballs were nice too. these 3 items were plenty for 4 girls. awesome food!"}
{"text":"Ordered their cannoli dessert since on Buddy's \"Cake Boss\" T.V. show, it's the best thing ever. Tried it, but it was very stale. I'll give it another try next time to taste their main dish to see if they're any good but the real reason why I'll be returning is their phenomenal service."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Sunday without a reservation; they were busy but we only waited for about 20 mins. Our waiter brought us the drinks and dinner menu and took our orders right away. I ordered the creamy tomato chicken pasta (forgot the exact name), my hubby ordered a meat source pasta and we ordered a Mac and cheese for our toodler. Before the meal, they gave us a piece of freshly baked bread to start with. Our meals came fast and it looked and tasted very good. We finished everything fast. Our waiter was very attentive and the restaurant was nice with live music. 

oyster bar at harrah's, this restaurant only charged me 9 dollars for the kid meal with a much better service and food. And you charged us 11 bucks for a plain white rice and a piece of dry chicken breast."}
{"text":"I attended Buddy V's brunch in mid April after out-of-town friends asked some Strip brunch suggestions. I was really pleased with their choice and so were they. The selection was smaller than a typical strip Buffet, but everything I ate was high quality and tasty, unlike a lot of dishes on a typical Buffet. The shrimp cocktail we're huge and plentiful, the meat and cheese selection was awesome and the crepes with berries were excellent. The dessert table allows you to try many versions of Buddy's pastries, my favorites were  zeppole(zonuts), the cannoli and the Italian cookies. I was so impressed with this brunch, that the following month when my mother and Aunt came to town, I brought them there as a treat. On my second visit I did the Bloody Mary bar, which was excellent and I was pleased to learn that I could choose from other alcoholic drinks as part of my $15 all you can drink price. I also tried the Bellini and the sangria and both were excellent. I will be bringing many people to this brunch when they come to town. $35 for a Strip brunch of this quality is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Experience was good. Food was good. Food took a little longer than expected to come out? 

Service was stellar and our server was funny and informative. They always made sure we had what we needed."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant.  I went there recently for dinner and sat at a table in the bar area.  To start they will bring a basket of bread/breadsticks and olive oil.  You know how sometimes you want to get an appetizer but it might be too big for 2 people so you don't get it?  No problem!  We were lucky enough to have gone during happy hour and didn't realize that they had specials during that time.  Because of happy hour we were able to try several appetizers in smaller portions so we could enjoy and taste a few things.  We had the calamari, Grandma's meatballs.  For salads were tried the cesar and mozzarella caprese.  They have homemade croutons in their salads that are unbelievable.  All were delicious.  In addition we had Italian sangria for $4 a glass.  Try and top that in Vegas folks!  For dinner we had the shrimp scampi and cheese ravioli.  Everything was excellent.  We were saying how we wish Buddy would open one of these restaurants in our area because we would be regular customers.  We'll be back Buddy -- thanks again!!!"}
{"text":"Buddy V's bottomless brunch was perfect! I feel like a brunch buffet can tend to disappoint, this one did not. The Mac and cheese carbonara and carving station were my favorite. But the bottomless drinks is where it's AT! Our waiter was the best, he kept the bottomless drinks coming, no need to ask. And the drinks weren't 80% juice either like you can find with a lot of the bottomless drink offers, they were legit good drinks. I'm so happy we made it over here - would absolutely come back, worth every penny!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Buddy V's looking on Yelp for an Italian dinner while in Vegas.  We lucked out that it was restaurant week too, so we were able to try quite the variety of options.

The restaurant is located in the front of the Venetian, so overlooks the strip making for a nice view at night.

We started out with the cheesy garlic bread, which was huge and quite good.  We also had the meatballs, which were very flavorful and the red sauce was delicious.  For dinner, the other half had the chicken parmesan, which he loved. I had the linguini vongole, which is my go to usually, and I thought it was fresh and well flavored, and not overly oily (my sometimes complaint).

We finished with a plate of all of their desserts, and every single one was good.  I think the cannoli may have been my favorite.

I did not realize until know that this is the Cake Boss' restaurant, but now that I know that, I think he should be the Boss of an Italian dinner too."}
{"text":"First off... Buddy V's food...  Always amazing!  Service usually amazing as well.  However, this review is for the waiter Kaleb.  Who wasn't even our waiter.  We made a reservation and were seated at one of the two chef's tables.  After giving us the details on the family style meal not on the menu our waiter filled our drinks.  Then we met Kaleb... Nope not our waiter.  He informed us we were being moved because they wanted to use our table for a 12 top.  There were six of us.  He didn't ask he told us we needed to get up and move and leave our drinks on the table.   We asked what was going on.  He just kept saying we had to move.  So as we were being basically pushed to another table at the back of the place he was being a jerk through the process.  Then he tried to switch us from the lunch menu to he dinner menu without explaining what the difference was.  Also telling us he would get a free desert for one of us.  Apparently the menu change is basically a higher price and more items.  Luckily he wasn't going to be our waiter at the new table.  As most should do we called the manager over.  He apologizes and asks us if we want a different table.   Which we didn't care about the table.  He was missing the point Kaleb was being a jerk.  He offered at least free desert to all of us.  We even confirmed it was all of us and not one of us.   Our waitress Kristy... Was amazing!!! So again take note this 1 star rating is not the norm... we generally would give it 5.  Kaleb should get a 0.  Even a few of the staff agreed and confirmed Kaleb was a jerk.  The manager was subpar.  When ordering the apparently free desert we were told it was for 4 of us.   Our waitress went and made sure it was adjusted to what was promised.  Again, We would request Kristy because her service was amazing and she dealt with the situation better than the manager.  When we left 2 hours in... The 12 top never showed up.  We were going to order the family dinner.  So they lost out on probably twice bill and still would have been able to seat the 12 top.  When we told the manager on the way out that that party never showed he said they had to save the reservation and we should be happy because he bought us over $100 worth of desert.  We reminded him that 6 people x $9 doesn't quite equal that.  He says ... \"Well I tried.\" We didn't care about the free desert.  It was how the restaurant handled it.  The point is how this situation was handled.  In our opinion ... It was terrible."}
{"text":"I love Italian food in general, but this place is NEXT LEVEL AMAZING!!!! Everything is delicious. Plenty of sauce on the pasta, homemade croutons on the salads that were still hot (!), and mouth wateringly rich desserts. 

You will not be disappointed with your meal, no way."}
{"text":"Food was good and the service was excellent. Classic Italian place with a nice happy hour. Good for a quick bite and a couple drinks."}
{"text":"We have been to Buddy V's many times and the food is delicious!  My favorite is the eggplant parmesan...delicious and tender!! Their bread is always served warm and fresh and you just want more.  My only complaint is that I never have enough room in my stomach to have dessert!"}
{"text":"We were SO happy with our meals. There were 8 of us and we all walked away raving. The service is fantastic. The food is amazing. I had a plate of the best spaghetti pomodoro i've ever had--that sauce was unreal. We're from NJ and NY so good italian food is what we are used to but we were really, really impressed here. Its casual too which is great and convenient. No white tablecloth. The portions were perfect. I hate when you get a huge overwhelming plate of pasta and you can't finish it or you overeat. Take my advice and get the warm chocolate cake filled with nutella served with salted caramel ice cream for dessert. It was out of this world!"}
{"text":"I was at the Venetian/Palazzo Shops when I saw a sign that said \"Carlos Cupcakes\" and \"Buddy V's Ristorante\". We went to Carlos and had an amazing eclair and I saw that across the way there was this restaurant which I found out was owned by the same person who owns Carlos. Anyways let me tell you why this place is amazing.

Service:

It was lunch, so we got in really quickly. We asked to be seated at a window and they did just that! The servers were all really nice and were happy to be doing their job. One plus is that I was really thirsty at the time and they were on top of refilling my water. (5 out of 5 stars)

Ambiance:

It's really beautiful in here. When you sit inside it feels nothing like the craziness of Vegas. It's so nicely decorated in here, and it's huge so you get seated quickly as well as you don't feel crammed or packed! (5 out of 5 stars)

Food:

So we were sinners and had dessert before lunch (to be fair we didn't have breakfast). I said to my family, \"if the eclair is this amazing, then I'd love to see what the restaurant is like.\" My dad wanted to go elsewhere, but I made him come here and all of us were drawn by the selection on the menu. We all ended up ordering Philly Cheesesteaks. Let me tell you, that was probably one of the best Philly Cheesesteaks I've ever had in my life! So flavorful! There were other things on the menu too, like chicken parmesan, pastas, and lasagnas that I saw people eating nearby which all looked amazing! (5 out of 5 stars)

I am for sure coming back! This is our new favorite place. It blew away all our expectations and I am dying to have more of that Philly Cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"The $20.18 lunch for Restaurant Week drew us in on a Sunday morning. We got seated right away and was pleasantly surprised to hear live music (Sinatra songs) and a wide variety of appetizing brunch stuff . I ordered off of the restaurant week menu : Caesar salad, tasty and good size chicken parmigiana with spaghetti and cannoli. My husband made a mad dash to the wonderful brunch spread ($34.95). Picture of brunch selections is attached to this review. It was a perfect Sunday morning for us: live, relaxing music, wonderful brunch and service by Freddy and busser Christian was excellent! Mac and cheese carbonara, sausages and bread selection was top notch and lastly the tiramisu is amazing. We highly recommend and give 5 Stars all the way !"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Staff was friendly and helpful! Only reason they didn't get 5 stars is the weird menu and times. There are too many different times and menus. It got pretty confusing. We went during brunch and didn't realize it was actually a buffet until we sat down. We ended up eating off the A La Carte menu. Chicken Parm was the best I've had. While chicken fingers were included in the brunch buffet, you couldn't order them off kids menu. Ended up getting plain & dry chicken parm & son ate it up. Food is great, just be sure to look at menu & times ahead of time so you aren't disappointed."}
{"text":"For Strip dining this is VERY good and very good price point too!
    They offer a lunch special menu with Gr8 selections 3 courses $22.00 soup/salad, main & dessert, not including drinks 
    Started with the Caesar salad, which is killer~ the croutons are deep fried corn meal & the creamy dressing is not over whelmed by anchovies . My gf had a spinach salad beautifully presented w/ red cherry tomatoes, red onions, grated parmesan. 
    Main courses ~ mine was the spaghetti Bolognese, flipping fantastic!!!!! The sauce or gravy depending where your from is \"Outta Site!\" My gf had the salmon generous portion (cooked to perfection) over sautéed veggies, again both were beautiful to look at and tasted equally DEEEELISH!!!!!!
   Dessert ~ I had tiramisu, excellent with a cappuccino & my gf has the raspberry sorbet with coffee .
   All in all just a great stop and quite good for the kiddos too!!!"}
{"text":"Slow service ( we were super hungry and wait about 35 minutes) bread is burned, bad experience!"}
{"text":"Best Italian I have had.  The Sunday pasta dish was incredible and I would fly to Vegas to have it again."}
{"text":"great meal, and great service.  authentic Italian food.
go and enjoy the wonderful dishes, and grab a canoli for dessert"}
{"text":"Amazing!! The food and the service were fantastic. The Italian Birthday cake was to die for!"}
{"text":"Just average.  We had reservations, but still waited for 20 minutes.  Once seated it took 20 minutes for our waitress to show up.  Meatballs were average.  Veal was tender and pretty good.  Won't come back:"}
{"text":"I made reservations through open table and was seated immediately upon arrival. Our waiter was excellent, always checking in on us and he had a great attitude. You get fresh bread with olive oil & vinegar once you order. We all ordered the $40 price fix dinner menu. Caesar salad to start (this comes with polenta croutons, it was an unexpected surprise!), chicken parm and the cannoli for dessert. All were delicious! The entree is large enough to split."}
{"text":"Eat here!   Food is fantastic.  Service is top notch.  A don't miss in Vegas.  The carbonara was excellent.  The cheesy garlic bread is a great appetizer.  Meatballs are fantastic. Chicken Parm is more than one person can eat."}
{"text":"So I love the food! Food is fantastic. Service was subpar. Our server Deanna seemed irked by our presence. If this is suppose to be a family friendly restaurant I definitely didn't get that feel. Half our party arrived and sat down and began eating. Then the rest of us joined them about 15 minutes later. We stood there waiting to be seated with our group for about another 10 by that time some of our group had finished eating stood up and left so we could sit. No one came to ask if we needed help as we stood next the table. Like I said food Amazing service Subpar at best."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Buddy Valastro as a tv chef personality; however, his restaurant did offer some delicious and memorable appetizers. 

Pros

Macaroni & Cheese Carbonara: One of the most decadent and rich mac & cheese I've had. Although the pancetta was lacking, the cheese sauce was pure heaven and the penne pasta was cooked just right. 

Aunt Nina's Mozzarella Corozza: It's pretty much a delicious version of the grilled cheese sandwich filled with plenty of mozzarella and pesto that is placed on a chunky bed of ragu. The only dislike I had about this appetizer was that the sandwich was drench in too much olive oil for grilling. 

Margherita Pizza: A simple pie that was baked to perfection with a perfect ratio of mozzarella, tomato, and basil. 

Overall great dining experience with delicious food to start off the day. I definitely will return and also will be saving room for dessert to try out his popular bakery, Carlo's Bakery that is located across the restaurant."}
{"text":"The menu had an insert for restaurant week that got you three courses for around $40. I had a salad, the spaghetti bolognese, and the pictured cannoli. My wife had the Cesar salad, the chicken parm, and a Nutella cake. Everything was really great. The service was very attentive. 

The restaurant is tucked away at the far end of the Venetian shops, and even though we're staying at this hotel, we'd have never found it. It's a relaxed atmosphere, and right across from it is Buddy V's bakery that had a line out the door. Looked fantastic, too!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Cake Boss, so I just had to visit the bakery and try the restaurant. I was impressed with the food. Everyone in my group ordered something different: spaghetti, pizza, and chicken parm. The chicken parm was my favorite. Also, the inside of the restaurant looked really neat. It's a fun place to eat at, and it is definitely a place you need to visit if you're a fan of Cake Boss! Also, I recommend the cannoli's! They are to die for! The cannoli cream was delicious and sweet! In fact, even if you're not hungry for a full meal, I recommend stopping by for a cannoli as a snack or dessert."}
{"text":"We had reservations for dinner at Buddy V's on our second evening in Vegas. However, after indulging in a tall, alcoholic slushy sold on the Strip, we were not up for dinner and canceled our reservation. Throughout our stay, we dined at several high end establishments, but none were as good as we found Buddy V's to be when we popped in for lunch on our last day!  The staff greeted us warmly, suggested we take a window seat with a great view of the strip and were responsive and attentive during our meal.  My husband and I ordered the three course express lunch, which was an incredible value at $22 by Vegas standards. I had the panzanella salad and found it to be superb. My husband had the Caesar salad served with polenta croutons, which was pure deliciousness. For our entrees, we both had the chicken Parmesan, again delicious . The lunch portion was so generous, that we could have easy shared one order. We looked forward to the dessert, as that is what Buddy V is known for. We were not disappointed: the cannoli was heavenly on its own, but the dark chocolate sauce put it over the top. Hubby had the salted caramel gelato served with biscotti. Good, but no competition with the cannoli.
We were so glad we were able to finally dine at Buddy V's! It was the best meal, value and service of our vacation."}
{"text":"Ordered pasta, italian birthday cake and meatballs. Bartended was attentive. Price is ok with the food and its in Vegas so a lil bit pricey."}
{"text":"Best food I've ever eaten in my life.  We tried beef medallion, carbonara, Mac and cheese, shrimp linguini, Italian birthday cake, warm Nutella cake, creme brûlée, homemade lemonade. Wow wow wow, best food and drink I've ever had. Even the coffee was good. Everything was authentic. Staff were friendly and good looking. I absolutely love this place. Kudos to the chef. Thank you to our servers Caleb and Angelo for a wonderful night at your restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I had an amazing experience here on Saturday night. They accommodated our large group and the service was exceptional. The food is delicious and the ambiance is very lively and fun. The views of the strip are great as well. I frequent the Palazzo and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was delicious!! We were here twice and all the time the food was perfect! Pasta and chicken are deliciously good! In my opinion, this is the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas...and in San Francisco! Highly recommend to try it!"}
{"text":"We went to Buddy's on our first night in Vegas.  The atmosphere was great and I really liked the decor.  Our waiter looked just like Buddy's cousin and had a great personality.  I started with a Caesar salad that had more dressing than lettuce.  the best part was the soft croutons on top.  A bowl of those would have been awesome.  Salad, not very good.
I then just wanted meatballs and the waiter talked me into pasta and meatballs.  The balls were small and not very flavorful.  My wife had chicken marsala.  there were 4 full breasts in the order.  it was a huge portion.  She liked it.
We passed on dessert in order to gamble sooner.  Overall, the food was ok but the price for what we got was too expensive.  
The next night we went to Lavo in Palazzo and spent $20 more per person and had a way better eating experience.  Do yourself a favor, and stick to Buddy's Bakery across the hallway and skip the restaurant. Too many better options in and around the Venetian."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas!

Excellent happy hour, large amount of seating, welcoming environment and totally tasty! This joint is delish, the hubs and I have been twice and I highly recommend it. Service is great, cocktails are fabulous and food is fantastic. The price is a little high for my usual, but is on point for a quality spot in this city!

The service is also great, the bartender to the hostess are all friendly and on top of it. Our recent experience even had a fab server (Christine?) who said she constantly checks the yelp reviews to ensure quality experiences! She also recommended the creme brulee, but we were so stuffed from garlic bread and pasta that there was simply no room. But, I might have to give it a try next time!

They also have a fantastic happy hour, and supposedly a great brunch. I say yes!"}
{"text":"Much better than I expected.  Went on a Sunday morning so it was a brunch buffet that I did not partake in, so I only ordered Tomato Basil soup.  The soup was good, though serving size was small for the price and it didn't come with bread.  My wife got the buffet and really liked it and she snuck me some bread for my soup and that bread was also good.  

All in all, for a place founded based on a TV show, it's really pretty decent.  However, it's overpriced.  As a bonus, the Carlo's Bakery is across the hall."}
{"text":"We came here for the brunch buffet and it was honestly the most amazing food I've ever had. Everything was so delicious and fresh. A lot of buffets have an overwhelming amount of food and you don't get to try it all. Buddy V's had the perfect amount of food. I was able to try everything that I wanted! I would highly recommend the brunch buffet. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Not as pleased as I thought I would be!

Came here for a birthday celebration while in Vegas and was let down.

Got here on a Saturday evening ready to feast and was seated promptly after waiting for the rest of my party to arrive. The hostess lead my group to a table by the window and we were seated and given menus.

The items on the menu seemed really good. I knew I wanted something with sausage while the rest of group went with the steaks and spaghetti. The first issue came when everyone had decided on what they wanted and they server took 20 minutes to come back to the table to take our order. That was somewhat odd especially since when the drink was taken he overlooked my order, seriously!!!! I had to ask another waiter who was helping another table to grab my drink, that's not good.

Next, when the waiter did eventually come over to take our orders he insisted on orders rather than giving recommendations, hmmmm, not smooth! The issue with the orders was that everyone's order was taken except for one but that member of my party could not order because the waiter has walked away after getting the 5th order. Why would you do that when there is another person at the table!!! Once again, we had to get another waiter to add another steak to our order because our waiter was unable to do that the first time!!

As for the food, my meal was great. Everyone that ordered a steak loved their food. However, the spaghetti, I was informed, was a bit sour! I did not try it but I told by another member of my dinner party. 

Once finished with our food. We had to wait another 20 minutes before we could get the check. Getting the check went like this. In finally getting the attention of the waiter I got two words out asking for the check and then he interrupted and didn't let me finish to offer dessert. Seriously, usually there is a back and forth in communication but this guy had to speak over me, confusing to me! Again, he was insistent about getting a dessert rather than suggesting or recommending. 

Once I finally got the check everyone was ready to go because this waiter was just no helpful in explaining anything or being attentive to our party. Not a memorable birthday dinner for the birthday girl after talking with her about her dinner. She liked the food but the service a bit aggressive. I guess working here causes the workers to be impatient and overbearing. I don't think so because the other waiters that I talked to were very gracious about assisting my table. I think the gentleman that helped us that evening was just trying way to hard and no making a good impression. 

The food was fine but the service was below what I expected based the reviewed I have heard about Buddy V's. I wanted to 5 star this place but the service killed that potential rating. I hope this situation does not happen to anyone else. But, kudos to the chefs in the kitchen who worked hard to prepare the food.

{"text":"This place is always good. Eveytime we come to vegas we have to stopped for dinner here or lunch. The chicken parm is delicious and the service is always good. I also get the buddy vs specialty pozza yumm and the cesar sals with the calamari is on point"}
{"text":"Excellent top to bottom.  The service at the bar was great.  There were two gentlemen who played music in the bar area and they were talented.  Extensive wine list.  Caesar salad had a nice surprise-and-delight element of warm polenta croutons.  Yum.  Grandma's meatballs...excellent.  I am a tough critic of restaurant meatballs and those balls delivered!  Beef, pork and veal is always the right combination of flavor.  Red sauce great.  And the chicken with rigatoni in vodka sauce with pancetta...delish.  Rich, big flavor.  Huge portions.  The hubs and I split everything so don't be shy about sharing!  Great experience."}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of Buddy so my friend and I decided to try it out. Service was exceptional, and we were suprised at how fast we got our food. The chicken marsala was good, but nothing more special than the others I have tried. The real reason we came was for the lobster tail and cannoli. It was amazing and even better then we imagined.  A definite must try when visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. I think about this place and my mouth still waters. Yes, I agree it is a bit pricey, but what my fiancé and I ended up doing is splitting the food. We went for dinner. We got the \"My Wife's Eggplant Parm\" for the appetizer and it was AMAZING. It is pretty filling. For the entrée, we got Chicken Rigatoni \"Alla Vodka\" and it's just WOW. The food was filling and tasty. I will definitely go back to it. The food is rich and creamy. You don't get food like this anymore."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to have dinner here. My partners Spaghetti was nice but we both agreed that my Lasagna wasn't. I didn't even eat half of it and when I told the waitress that I didn't like it that much she didn't even reply. It was okay, but severely overpriced, felt like a let down overall."}
{"text":"The service was bad and slow and the food was mediocre. They were trying to have a home cooking vibe and it was a fail. I wouldn't go again"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Venetian. Service is good food is even better!! If you watch the show or are a fan of Italian food you need to try it!"}
{"text":"Excellent meatball sub - it's huge and good to share so you have room for the super fabulous cannoli! The food is amazing and the service is amazing as well! This is a must in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm a cake boss fan and I keep it real! I have visit the Hoboken bakery, New York, and now Vegas! In my honest opinion majority of the desserts are very good but price wise they are overpriced! I remember going the first time and spending over $50 on a couple treats! Now let's talk about the brunch! It is totally worth $34.95! ALL YOU CAN EAT for a reasonable price! I rather go eat for brunch than spend that money on a few desserts! Think about it! You can eat as many tiramisu, red velvet cake and so on for one price! Not to mention the delicious grandma meatballs, mac and cheese, chicken, french toast, Italian sausage, and so much more!! The service is a PLUS everyone was awesome and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant convieniently located within Grand Canal Shoppes.

Food: Chicken Parm comes with two big pieces of chicken smothered in cheese and a side of spaghetti, which is perfect for sharing.  Buddy's favourite pizza was good too but could have more toppings.
Chocolate nutella cake with ice-cream was delicious and only $9.

Place: nice ambience, liked the Cake Boss display of cakes at the front of the restaurant and the his family themed decor and menue was a nice touch.  Get a booth seat or seat by the window.

Service: very good, friendly, and prompt

Overall would recommend for a moderately priced Italian meal.  Also try a treat at his pastry shop across the aisle."}
{"text":"We love everything in Buddy V's Sunday brunch! Just the right amount of choices for a buffet. Not overwhelming; Nothing goes to waste  Service was great too!  and there was live feel-good music while we enjoy family time and our scrumptious meal  Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"If you come here, ask for Peter!  He was an AMAZING server!!  And hands down, eat the linguine and clams!  Warning: There was a lot of garlic!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at buddy vs this weekend and it was pretty good. Except my chicken Parmesan had VERY salty cheese on it. Calamari was pretty good and they give pretty good portions."}

{"text":"Amazing dinner, great atmosphere and exceptional service! We came here for my moms 60th bday. Our server, Peter, was so incredibly friendly and was joking around with us the whole time. He definitely made the experience an unforgettable one! The surf and turf was SO good, my steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare and that lobster! Yum! We order the garlic bread and mozzarella appetizers and they were both just delicious. The creme brûlée was INCREDIBLE. As was the lobster tail dessert and the Nutella chocolate lava cake thing. We will definitely be coming back! Thanks, Peter for the great service! Oh, and the prices are so reasonable! Between $30-$50 per plate but it has the atmosphere more like a fine dining setting."}
{"text":"Had a yummy dinner here with hubby and a friend during a work conference. We started off with an order of fries and a caprese salad. The fries were excellent, and our waitress had the kitchen made a larger caprese salad for us so we could share it. It turned out it was burrata cheese, which was awesome. Hubby had the enormous veal parmesan chop and it was the size of a dinner plate. Our friend had the lasagna, and I had the scallops. All the entrees were excellent. They miss the mark a little on dessert. Although I had a molten nutella cake which was delish, hubby had the Italian birthday cake which was extremely bland and very disappointing. Our friend had the lemon cheesecake, which had a nice bright lemony flavor, but I'm just not a fan of cheesecake, so I can't impartially rate that. Overall, a great dining experience, although the place is extremely loud and I was hoarse by the end of the meal from trying to be heard over the din! Oh, and Buddy was actually there that night making the rounds saying hello to people. That was kind of fun too!"}
{"text":"Overall probably 3 is fair. The space has gorgeous views and is worth the short walk from venetian or palazzo. The food is above average Italian, but not spectacular. The focaccia should've been warm, and why do we need to ask for olive oil? That's not authentic . We had chicken parm and pasta. We said we were sharing but plates were just dumped. Had a very nice bus boy but the waiter was creepy and a little scary. The chicken parm was good, pasta was a little on the creamy side. Overall pretty mediocre for the Boss, hope the cakes are better and they hire some pleasant waiters"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Some of the best Italian that I have ever had. Went there for a birthday dinner and was very happy and full when I left."}
{"text":"Absolutely enjoyed it. We went with reservations (pardon the pun) expecting the food to rest on the tv show. We were happily surprised. Our waitress found out we were from Virginia as she was too. The personal touch was very nice. Food was great, served at the right time, tasted great, and ample portions. The price was very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Not easy to find, but no big deal.  Had the Meatball Sub (Hero) and the problem I had was that it came on a toasted roll?!  It does not say that in the description on the menu and to me, changes the whole delicious simplicity your watering mouth is expecting. Taste of the Meatballs were good and I ended up just eating them.  Now YOU know."}
{"text":"Cake was average. Nothing special. Looked delicious but lacked in flavour and was honestly too sweet. 

I ordered the rainbow cake which was visually appealling but lacked any flavour. It tasted like sugar imbalanced with more sugar. At $8 a peice it was hardly worth the price and it took me almost 8 sittings to finish because i couldnt handle more than 3 bites at a time due to overwhelming and overpowering flavour of sugar. I love desserts but it wasnt balanced at all and honestly most church bakers or even school bake sales make better cake. 

Only upside was the short line and the great single serve packaging for the cakes to go. Otherwise skip it and head ANYWHERE else. Its a fad place from tv and the desserts are extremely lacking in quality."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a wedding and stopped in here for dinner after the wedding rehearsal. There was 12 of us and we did not make ressies. However they were able to sit two tables of six next to each other which was nice.

We all ordered drinks and food and the time was pretty good. The drinks were a bit slow but that's probs a good thing because it slowed down my dranking pace. There were  two servers helping us, one for each table and they asked that we all order at the same time. We all got our foods which was delicious. I felt that the serving sizes for the prices were a bit off. $12 for a side salad seemed a bit high, even for Vegas. The server at my table did a good job upselling a bunch of items, like shrimp with the scallops and scallops with the steak but she did not mention that there would be a price increase or the amount. Which is fine, we were hungry but a courtesy would have been nice.

They also brought out a birthday cake for the group in honor of the new couple. That was a very nice touch.

Overall this place was pretty good Italian. It is also across from Buddy's Baker which was genius. I got dessert at the restaurant and also at the baker across the street. I regret nothing."}
{"text":"Great place to go. Had some awesome hh specials food is great and the bar staff was super friendly. Not too expensive. Second visit and both times it was great"}
{"text":"Place was phenomenal,
We even saw Buddy walking around with his wife, such a great experience.
We went for the Brunch Buffet, I really cant find anything that I didn't like, all around a great package meal, plus we did the bottomless Drinks, from Mimosas to Bellinis and great beer. Awesome views and the service was excellent.
Emily the Bartender/Server was on point, we broke two glasses and no one made a fit or said anything, they only care about your satisfaction. Ill most definitely be back for any meal on my next Vegas visit."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas you HAVE to come here. The food here can not be beat. The best meatballs in the world as an appetizer!! The chicken Marsala is to die for, and the Nutella chocolate cake made me speechless. The prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I have eaten here recently a couple times. One time the service was shitty and the other it was great. The food gets 5 stars easily. You get what you pay for here. 

Grandma's Meatballs: beef, veal, and pork. Good flavor and easily shared but you wont want to. 

Free Bread: dude came around once with bread and that was it. I wanted more bread! He poured some oil and vinegar for us (a lot of it) and gave us 1 piece of bread for it. That's ok I made up for it by eating all the bread stick thingys that are in the cups on the table. 

Buddy's Salumi and Cheese Board: damn yo this was real good. I didn't care for the olives but I'm not a fan of them anyway. The meats and cheeses I could have ate all day.

Orecchiette and Italian Sausage: This dish had sausage in its name so I ordered it. It was not as heavy as a spaghetti with sauce which was nice. I ate every bite and would order it again. 

Spaghetti Bolognese: I was very surprised to like this. When it came out I expected some sort of red sauce on it but that wasn't the case. My wife took a bite and really liked the taste too. Winner winner bolognese dinner!

Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake: Came with salted caramel ice cream. This was hot and good and everyone should order it. 

Zeppole: I guess a spiced sugar is outside of these but I didn't taste anything but fried dough. I didn't like this."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and I was so excited to find a place with bottomless mimosas, sangria, and bloody Mary's.  It is a great brunch spot with a great ambience.  The meatballs were delicious and the build your own crepe was cool. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"What a nice place to eat! Not too fancy. Not too cheap. Great for families! It wasn't the best in flavor since most everything was on the bland side but it was still good. 

Chicken parmigiana- a bit bland chicken. Needs a bit more spices. Still good to eat though! Spaghetti was yummy! Some Italian places make this dish too salty so I preferred it more bland and adding a bit of salt. 

Prime rib- yes, at an Italian restaurant. Not the best to order but it was a prix fixe meal so we tried it. Prime rib was also a bit bland, but again, better than salty, which I've gotten too. 

Lou's gravy- meat lovers would love this one! All kinds of meats- sausage, meatballs, lamb, I forgot the others. Husband loved it! He said it was actually too much meat. That's not often heard of. 

Clam spaghetti- seasoned on the bland side again but clams were juicy and not chewy. 

Garlic cheese bread- now that was delicious!! I could have more of that!! We're ordering more of that next time. 

Customer service- 5 star rating!! The young gentleman was very accommodating. He was so patient with my son too. When asked why there was no star on the Xmas tree, he said he wasn't sure but he would look into getting one next year. He then took my son to see a bigger tree at the back of the restaurant to check for a star. He said he'd tell the manager that that tree needed one too after confirming with my son. The extra help in getting out dishes and filling our cups were so \"johnny on the spot\" too!!! Loved every bit of the wait staff!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was  very unexpectedly good! Good service and good food! Spaghetti and meatball was great and good amount. I always went to Allegro at Encore but I found a new love now! Great place to try especially with familyz"}
{"text":"I had the panzanella salad, and it was delicious!!!! I was looking for something light to eat but with substance since I was going out to drink later that night (vegas, go figure). Perfect amount of veggies to cheese. Yum!!!

For dessert, we ordered the lobster tail! So good. We came for my bachelorette dinner so they even decorated it for me!! Although the \"flaky pastry\" was a little too crunchy for me, the custard cream and fresh fruits were perfection!! 

Definitely get the lobster tail next time you're here!!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! Coming from a \"enlarged family\" through a recent wedding, I am part of an Italian family and we eat a lot of italian food. We were on a Girls Trip to Vegas, each celebrating something different but together and wanted to dress up for a ladies night out. We were able to get a reservation same day, the wait was so short once we got there and we were able to get some great group shots thanks to some other guests. We got an amazing window booth that over looked the strip and could see the gondolas below - it was not too loud and had a great vibe. 

Our waiter Chaz - was amazing! Quick and efficient, he recommended his favorites and we took his advice - food was perfect and portions were definitely Italian Style!
Share plates so you can try a little of everything! and still have room for Buddy V's award winning desserts."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar only

While my loving, wonderful husband waited in line at Carlo's Bakery, I thought I'd pop over to Buddy V's across the way and try a libation.  Since I had no clue what I wanted, I asked the bartender to \"make something up with amarone\", and she did.  I like surprises!  

Open space with a nice view - and it's right across from the bakery.  Check! Check!"}
{"text":"As a NJ expat, I can say one of the few things I miss most living in Hawaii is exceptional Italian food. Luckily, my boyfriend comes from a line of Italian chefs and isn't afraid to be super critical when it comes to Italian, and I can say he would have approved and I can't wait to take him here. The eggplant Parmesan was mouth watering my delicious, and caprese salad had the freshest ingredients. The four sides we ordered (polenta, asparagus, kale, and mashed potatoes) were a bit too over seasoned or cheesy, but the main dishes were phenomenal. Highly recommend the cheese/cured meat board. Friendly atmosphere with a great view of the strip."}
{"text":"We were super excited to go to Buddy's and were definitely not disappointed! Portion sizes were great and everything was presented beautifully. Our server, Georgio, claimed to be Buddy's godson and produced a picture of Buddy holding him as a baby, but I'm a natural born skeptic and wonder if it's true :) Nonetheless, Georgio was very attentive and knowledgable about the entire menu. He even told my friend that what she was planning to order was too boring and she would probably prefer something else! He made a recommendation and she ended up loving it! My dish was nothing short of fantastic and next time I'm in Vegas will definitely be going back! The bread before dinner was served warm with traditional oil and tasted soooooo good. 

My only suggestion is definitely talk to them ahead of time about how the checks are going to work. We felt bad making him split it a couple ways because it took a while in the system."}
{"text":"I ordered from the lunch specials and chose the tomato bisque, chicken parmesan and tiramisu. All dishes were phenomenal and the service was fast. The chicken parm dish was really filling so I took some to go and ate it as a later lunch."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is overpriced at $34.95 per person.  Food that was provided was good quality as was the service.  Would be improved by including a drink, smoked salmon, omelette station.
Recommended gratuity is calculated including sales tax which is inappropriate."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to stop in buddy v's for our last night in Vegas to get some homemade Italian food. 11/4/16. We had made reservations for 8pm for 7 and by the time that came around we still had to wait half an hour for them to clear the table and what not. After being seated we were giving menu and drink menu. Everything sounded really good and look delicious! I order the madiline penne and my friends all ordered something different. The food came out fairly quick, but it seemed like our waiter kept on forgetting what we had. The service was okay, but it was as they were almost rude. The food was also okay it wasn't as expected. I've actually had better! So overall buddy v is just hype because of the TV show. At this point it was an experience and that it's really up to you if you'd like to try it out. Give it a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Great atmosphere. My husband and I were looking for a place for lunch and stumbled upon this place. While I know of his show I can't honestly say I've ever watched it. The capresse salad was delicious! I had the penne alla vodka and it was too die for! And my husband had the meatball sub, which he also loved. We shared the Nutella cake for dessert and it was also good, but the salted carmel ice cream was the true star! I would highly recommend stopping in here for a meal!"}
{"text":"Brunch Review: fresh, delicious, attentive staff.. Even the strawberry lemonade was freshly made by the bar and taste amazing, not too sweet -added perk it comes in a keepsake glass.. HIGHLIGHT OF THE DAY!! Buddy Valastro walks in mid brunch and says hello to everyone, and takes pictures with us.. Very sweet and humble!"}
{"text":"The restaurant's web site shows that it opens at 11:00 a.m. That is incorrect. We arrived a bit after 11, and that, in and of itself, was a trial. Then, we waited...and waited. Finally, a bit after 11:30, the gate was rolled back. Second in line, we asked for a table by the windows (remember: empty restaurant). The er, um, \"hostest\" told us that THOSE seats were only for groups of 6 or more. By the time we left, 3 of those tables were occupied (out of about 10), all with parties of 4 or less.  Our waitstaff was attentive, as was the person who filled the water glasses and actually brought out the food. Both orders had been left under a heat lamp too long, and the one order, a pizza, was less than warm. The other order had much to be improved. We will not be returning, nor will we suggest it to out of town guests."}
{"text":"True Italian breadsticks: thin, crunchy, and dry just like I remember from NY and New Jersey. Calamari: crispy but not chewy, came with some thin sliced grilled lemon, green pepper; an interesting combo.  The fried mozzarella could have been an entree: more like a massive stuffed grilled cheese sandwich with a light marinara sauce. Caesar salads came with fried Parmesan cheese polenta cubes.  What a flavor accent! Carbonara (oh to die for): just enough bits of ham, a good dose of cream and tons of cheese with al dente pasta that tasted homemade. A large enough portion that I got a dogie bag and enjoyed it again the next day. The lobster roll: a flaky layered pastry with a cream filling and surrounded by berries.  Who could not like it?
We came as part of a romantic promotion through our timeshare. Both hubby and I agreed, it was a shame we waited until our last day to eat there. Or we would have returned to try other dishes.  The wait team kept us filled with ice tea and water without apparent effort; we never sat with used dishes on the table (one of my pet peeves). All in all, I felt like I was back in the hood, eating Nona's good food with familia."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The waiter was really good as well. He took real interest in our food preferences and suggested food/wine. During booking the reservation, I had told them it was my girlfriend's birthday, which they remembered and surprised her (and me) with a cake and candle. The ambience is really good as well."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Good service. By hard to find. Not many signs to find restaurant. The bakery across from the restaurant does extremely well."}
{"text":"My mother and I came here for the Sunday Brunch Buffet. Everything was amazing! From the fresh made crossants, to the chicken Parmesan and all the yummy desserts! We will definately be coming here again."}
{"text":"Great meal at Buddy V's! The Grilled Octopus app was the most tender I've ever had. The Chicken Marsala was savory, the way it should be. Too many restaurants use sweet Marsala wine and ruin the dish. Buddy V's was right on, and a good portion size too. My wife's Capellini Shrimp Scampi was terrific. Very nice wine selection by the glass. By the way, the Caesar Salad with polenta croutons is a must have as well."}
{"text":"1) The linguini & clams was too salty. 
2) Manager took it back and told me yes chef agreed it was too salty.    
3) they replaced the plain pasta without the clams.
4) the second time complained it was not my order the linguini without clams and the manager attitudes changed so unpleasant and took the dish back to replace the 3rd.
5). The final bill, buddy v's charged me two orders on linguini & clams.    
6).  I will not go back and wont recommend on the services either."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. The spaghetti was great. Best garlic bread I've ever had! The Nutella cake dessert is an awesome choice. Our waiter was super friendly. He was Buddy's cousin and he was a lot of fun (taking pictures and joking with my 9 year old daughter). Food was stellar and he made it very memorable."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful brunch. The food is fresh and authentic. If you love Italian food this is the place. We opted for the all-you-can-drink Bloody Mary's, Bellini's, mimosas. The service was awesome and they were on top of the drinks and the refills. Although we didn't have children with us, there was a specific section for children's Foods like chicken fingers, Etc and desserts. This is our second time humor and we will be back."}
{"text":"Food was very good.   Service was very attentive,  perhaps too much so at times.  Very nice atmosphere.   If you are at Venetian or Palazzo give yourself some time because I found it tough to find.  Overall very nice experience and very good value.  Oh yeah, very good portions"}
{"text":"So happy I stopped by for lunch! The chicken Parmesan is AMAZING! Came in after a client told me how good the food was, hands down will be back. Probably after we found that client her dream house!"}
{"text":"Amazing service & food.
We were served by charles and he was the best server ive ever had. He really knows whats hes doing . Buddy should be greatful he has him representing his business!! 

Charles gave us advice about vegas attractions, and gave us advice about the menu... boy was he right. Get the bolanase speghitti amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was not good at all. Service had to be reminded to bring drinks and spoons returned because they were dirty. Recommend you skip and find another place to eat.   Highlight was the spaghetti."}
{"text":"My experience with BuddyV was terrible. I ordered house salad and the house special of shrimps with fettuccine. I told the waiter that I cannot have any bacon or pork products (due to religious reason); he understood but didn't care to mention that the salad has bruschetta on it. Well when the salad came I raised concerns and was told another salad is coming without meat.. but after ten minutes and rest of my party already had their salad finished; my salad never came. Later the manager came asking the same questions and promising another salad; to which I told him no since I didn't want start on salad while my party is on their main entrée'. I was hoping the food would be good, but no.. The pasta was not fully cooked, hard to chew, dry and only 3 shrimps!!! For a $30 entrée' I was expecting some good.  But no! This place is over rated; like many other things in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service! Cool bar with nice views of strip. A little bit of a walk to find the place. But once you do find the place it's very inviting. Chicken parmesan was good. Linguine clams was delicious and had enough to fill you up with a little bit of spice 
The deserts are AMAZING!!! The apple and the lobster things whatever you call them they were soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING Restaurant with an AMAZING crew! Joy, Thank you for being amazing! You gave the best service i have seen ever. My friends and I came to this restaurant not too long ago and Joy gave us the best service I have got ever. I highly recommend this place to everyone. The whole team was incredible."}
{"text":"I had the linguini with clams, my husband had the parm and my son had the spaghetti with meatballs.  It was all delicious!! The service was great and very family friendly not like some restaurants in Las Vegas that could be intimidating.  We also
had the hazel nut dessert with the salted Carmel ice cream and it was just the best!  Love this place."}
{"text":"Great Italian food and great value!

I found Buddy's on Yelp and was so happy that I gave the restaurant a try. We got there during happy hour and there was a variety of small plate appetizers for $5 each and a full menu as well. 

I ordered the fried calamari happy hour small bite for $5 and the sea bass for $29 as entree. The calamari was crispy and flavorful and for $5, it was a steal. 

The sea bass entree came with an arugula salad on the side and the fish came deboned and was crispy outside and perfectly tender inside. 

The ambiance is casual and the wait staff was very friendly. The restaurant was right across from Carlos Bakery and it is a great stop after dinner. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there for a friends birthday last night. Atmosphere is really comfortable and welcoming. Good crowd and energy. The food 100% delivered. My challenge was with the service. They're new so I'm sure they're working out kinks. But the waiter was so spotty - wouldn't see him for 15-20 minutes at a time. Forgot requests, didnt bring any pens for the checks. Overall great experience and ill be back."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Hostesses were not accommodating and acted like they were the ones running the place. Manager is clearly not on the side of the customer and inexperienced. With all of the choices available at the Venetian, I would think they would be more customer focused."}
{"text":"Been here for dinner before and loved it, so when I read about the Sunday brunch, I just had to come back and indulge.
I'm here to share with everyone that this brunch for under 35 dollars is a steal!
Fantastic fresh foods to meet everyone's needs. Charcuterie, cheeses, garlic breads, 5 carving station meats, panetone French toast, eggs, pastas, chicken parm, meatballs, killer tiramisu and other desserts. It's kid friendly too with a kids station even an adult would enjoy.
The staff is on top of things and Asst. GM Adam Margolies is visible and easy to talk to.
Sean was great to us last time for dinner, so from top to bottom, Buddy's has it all!"}
{"text":"Very good food! Service was very attentive! We ordered the smashed meatball sandwich and it was very good."}
{"text":"Classic Italian food with a cozy, yet contemporary atmosphere ~

I have to admit that I wasn't a fan of TLC's \"Cake Boss\" and didn't follow it but I knew of the show and appreciated that it was a family affair. When the restaurant opened in Vegas I didn't really have any desire to try it out until my man had a business lunch there and told me I had to try it. 

We've been here twice now and I'm happy to say that the food is just delicious! My favorite dish is Buddy's mother in law's capellini shrimp scampi. Packed with flavor I can't stop eating it and it never comes home with me for a late night snack. There's tons of garlic, roasted tomatoes, spinach and white wine! My man has enjoyed everything he's tried from the meatball sandwich, chicken parmigiana  and his favorite dish which happens to be the super cheesy lasagna. 

The warm, complimentary focaccia bread is always a hit and we've had the calamari and caesar salad which were great.

Don't forget to tell them if you're celebrating anything special as they'll bring out a mini cannoli on the house. 

Located across from the restaurant is Buddy's bakery which serves the best chocolate dipped strawberries in case you want something for later!"}
{"text":"The Tiramisu is the best I've ever had in my whole life. I order it every time I am here.   Beware that there is always a line if you come with a big party.  Make reservations in advance or take a chance with the bar area, which can give you a great view of the strip.  When I was previously here, there was live music with people dancing next to the bar area, but they didn't have a band this time. Not sure if this was due to a slow season in December.  Overall a very lovely atmosphere with great food."}
{"text":"So I went here with my family and everyone ordered different dishes. I tried a little bit everyone's dishes because I just love sharing food, and I must admit this place is amazing. I ordered salmon and it was cooked to perfection. My nephew had macaroni and cheese and it was the best I've ever had. Service was even better. The view is just incredible of the strip and I loved the big windows with natural sunlight coming in. It perfect and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was not a fan. The food was ok. Our food came out soon after we ordered it but that was the only positive. It took a long time before our order was taken and a very long time before getting the check! Will not be returning ever!"}
{"text":"I ate at the bar for happy hour. We really weren't planning on eating there but after going to Carlos bakery right before we thought we might get a snack here. Our bartender was cool at first and then became a bit pushy. The drinks were good. I got the sangria, my friend had a Bellini. 
So we each ordered a caprese salad and gnocchi to share. We received our caprese salads. It was a pretty good portion. We both agreed our salad needed some more vinegar and a bit of salt. It just tasted so bland. I love caprese salads so this was a real disappointment. We then receive ricotta cheese and bread. Neither of us touch it since we didn't order it. Then we figure out the gnocchi isn't coming. We eat the ricotta and both think the cheese is bland too!
I won't be coming back. But food was a huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"The last two times in Vegas I've eaten at Buddy V's. Both times I've had the smashed meatball sandwich. Big thumbs up! Meatball subs are, in my opinion, generally too dry, but the two I've had at Buddy's have been pretty moist. The parmesan fries are hot and crispy, they were very good. Sevice has been good, no problems in that area. My one complaint was the first time I went I got breadsticks, second time none. I am not a fan of Cake Boss so I was really just there for the food, next time I might try something different like chicken parm. Both times I was there it was a weekday afternoon right when they opened so it was not crowded. There was a lot of people at Buddy's bakery across the hall though."}
{"text":"We arrived around 11 to get some desserts at the bakery next door. The line was LONG so we decided on lunch here instead. You can get a Lobster Tail (for $15) and a few other things that you can only get at the restaurant. Prices are decent for a strip meal. The place was pretty empty so we were seated quick. They had a lunch deal which included a salad, entree and dessert for $22. They had enough options to choose from and everything was pretty tasty. I got the salad panzanella, margherita pizza and cannoli. Everything was great. I would have liked more fresh mozzarella on the salad because it was so good. The pizza could have used more sauce but those are my likes when I make that salad and pizza. I would go again for sure and maybe next time get the $15 Lobster Tail."}
{"text":"Excellent well worth the price! Went for desert but ended up having salad, dinner and desert.  We split the Lobster Tail and great coffee for desert.  The portions were perfect to split. We live in Las Vegas and can't wait to return and share with friends and family."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, excellent food, I love this place. will revisit when I am back in vegas."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Cake Boss, so when we visited Las Vegas, I have to eat at Buddy's restaurant.  The location is nice. Price is on the higher range. The serving size is good for one person, definitely not for sharing especially if you are hungry.  The pasta which we ordered Linguini with clams and lasagna are on the salty side. Actually it is salty. My son who ordered chicken blt like it a lot.  For desert, we ordered creme brulee and canoli. Of course, the canoli is to die for!!! Love it!!! But the creme brulee, i wanted it to be more like a flan but their version is more cream version."}
{"text":"Buddy V's restaurant was good but not great, which was disappointing. The service and setting was excellent and notable. I found everyone from the hostess to waitstaff to be courteous and helpful. The restaurant specializes in classic Italian-American fare like lasagna, chicken parm, and cannolis. 

The lasagna, Caesar salad, house salad, and cannoli were all delicious and a highlight of our visit. The chicken parm, unfortunately, was disappointing. There was barely any marinara sauce present and the chicken was not soft and succulent like I've come to expect from excellent Italian-American joints in the New York area. 

Overall there is clearly a strong vision coming from Buddy Valastro's family home cooking, but I assume there is some miss in the execution. The restaurant is good and I would recommend if in the area, but it was not a standout."}
{"text":"Outstanding food in great desserts sat at the bar two times when I was here this week Tawny Was a great bartender great server and a pleasure to talk with, comingback again which I do at least a few times a year."}
{"text":"Very good food! Some of the best bolognese I've found. Chicken rigatoni with vodka sauce was lovely. Good ceasar salad. No room for dessert, unfortunately. Eat here and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The design of the place is awesome and cozy..so many cool details. Service is on point...very friendly and attentive staff. Food isn't anything you haven't had before but simple and good, nonetheless. I wouldn't come here for a special occasion..more of a casual lunch spot in my opinion. Tomato soup is excellent and so was the pasta with vodka sauce..worth a visit. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"the pre fixed meal between 5-7 is a GREAT deal... appetizer meal and desert for $38... great views of strip and meatballs that melt in your mouth!!!!  excellent service and wonderful food..."}
{"text":"This is a great family style restaurant!  The food is extremely tasty and is set in a relaxed atmosphere. I definitely recommend you stop here while in Vegas ."}
{"text":"We were so excited about eating here, and the food was excellent.  I can't give it a higher rating because the service was absolutely terrible.  We were seated in about 10 minutes during lunch hour (1240ish).  We were seated at a table overlooking the strip (great) in the bar area (no problem).  The problem was that our waitress was the bartender, and despite only having one or two people at the bar the whole time we were there, it took ages to get anything done, including ordering drinks, our meal, dessert, etc.  It took almost 2 hours to have an app, a split meal, and a dessert.  The hardest working person in there was the busier, who was busting his butt the entire time!  He deserves a raise. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing !! Our waitress was so awesome. We told her we had a show to make and she said she would tell the back we were in a hurry. Our food came out in 10 mins and was so good. She was attentive and vey friendly could not have asked for better service. Completely impressed."}
{"text":"The service was totally awesome, our waiter Randy was very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine selection, and the buss boy Jamal was super attentive and very helpful. I didn't feel rushed, even though our order was complicated and had a few special requests. The food was the best Italian food I have had in a long time. We had 3 dishes with a range of steak, seafood, and pasta, and it was all amazing. I am very impressed with the whole experience, and I think Buddy V should be proud of this place. The management is obviously doing a great job here!"}
{"text":"Here for a quick lunch and I swear I wish...and I might come back for more. I had the lasagna and it was hands down the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"We got to experience this place randomly for happy our and are so lucky! This is a great happy hour stop! The sangria is to die for, great flavor and punch! We enjoyed their meatball HH app, delicious! Definitely put this place on your list of things to do!"}
{"text":"Fun environment based off of Cake Boss. Food was very good, and the service was decent. We had a nice seat by the window with a view of the strip which was neat. It seemed a little loud inside and our service seemed slightly rushed. The presentation and flavor of our dishes were wonderful."}
{"text":"We paid more and less in Vegas, but Buddy's was the best.  The \"Parm\" was a cheesy dream, The grilled salmon was cooked perfectly.  I guess it is the simple combination of the best ingredients with the presentation skills and technical excellence of a master baker that makes it so good.  This was the only restaurant we visited on or near the strip that didn't seem to be charging a location premium.  It was not inexpensive, but it was reasonable.  Oh-ya, save room for desert OMG!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come to Vegas frequently so of course when Buddy's opened we had to try it.  We experienced the best service of our lives, and we've eaten at 99% of the restaurants on the strip.  Our server Deanna was very attentive and friendly.  I will definitely request her table during my next visit.  The food was top notch quality food.  The caprese had amazingly fresh mozzarella, and the chicken parm was tender and delicious.  The cannolis are to die for....melt in your mouth amazing.  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have to say it was so much better than I was expecting! We found the restaurant pretty easily by following the maps around the shops but I can see how it can be difficult to find. The red and white checkered tablecloths on the tables in front of the restaurant made it obvious we had arrived. 

Buddy's is very spacious inside. I loved the decor of lights made with whisks from large mixers. Also, the rolling pins hanging and bundt pans were so creative. It felt very cozy and welcoming. 

On to the food! There were breadsticks waiting on the table. We were pleasantly surprised when they brought out olive oil and balsamic with warm focaccia bread...melted in your mouth. The bread was so soft, yet crunchy at the same time! We ordered the meatball sub with Tuscan fries, the Margherita pizza and kids spaghetti with tomato sauce. The Margherita pizza wasn't exactly as thin as most that I've had but very good! The crust was soft and a little thicker with chunks of tomatoes and fresh basil. My daughter ate so much spaghetti she couldn't believe how good it was. 

On to dessert! I loved how the dessert menu had pictures of Buddy's family, so sweet! We opted for the warm Nutella chocolate melting cake with salted Carmel ice cream. Words cannot even describe...we fought over it with our forks...it almost got ugly. There was not a crumb left. 

The service was great. I wanna come back for dinner now!

Con: the only thing negative which was quickly fixed, my daughter ordered a Shirley temple. It had no taste, tasted like colored water. No idea what the problem was but they brought another out and it was perfect."}
{"text":"The service was FANTASTIC!  We were a table of five and shared our entrees to have a variety of tastes.  Some of us loved the calamari, the other half thought it was too tough.  The eggplant parm was actually hard, so I'm glad it was a shared appetizer instead of a meal. I had read great things about the lasagna...but I must say, I was slightly disappointed.  The portions were huge but if nothing about the dish makes you want to  eat more then who cares?  The chicken parm was GREAT!  But the pasta it came with was OVERLY salty!!!  The Osso Bucco and Polenta were OUTSTANDING as was the Veal in bone parm....although another party at the table complained there was too much cheese on that.  The XL Lobster Tail for dessert is to die for :) ...and I really loved the cannoli.  The ambiance was great....and like I said, the service was stellar!  The portions were great, ... I just have a few complaints....and a few disappointments.  Would still give it another try to taste a few more things before discounting it."}
{"text":"Stayed at The Venetian and made a reservation for 5:15pm on Saturday night.  When we were to be seated, the hostess tried to sit us right opposite the open kitchen, which is brightly lit, noisy, steamy and certainly not where we wanted to be. She then went back to see where else we sit and we got a table for 2 in the bar. The food was good. Foccacia was warm and they offered oil and vinegar as well as butter. We found the service was fast, maybe a bit too fast.  Maybe Saturday night is a busy one,and they try to move their diners along. We had the beef medallion, $38, cooked a little too rare for medium, but it was tasty. The mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach that it was placed on, could have been a bit more generous. Very skimpy on those portions. We also had the price fixed dinner for $38, which gave you choices. We had: Grandma's meatballs, chicken parm with spaghetti and they were tasty but they skimped on the sauce so although it was good, it could have been better. The chicken parm was very crispy and tender but the spaghetti was a bit dry. The meatballs had a nice portion of sauce served with them, so we should have kept that dish, just for the leftover sauce. The desserts you could choose was a cannoli or a Nutella cake with salted carmel ice cream.  Nah...didn't appeal to us, but we were told you couldn't substitute from that menu.  Really?  I can understand the entrees but the desserts? We were told that they had a 'full dessert menu' but our waitress never offered to show it to us. Carlo's Bakery is right across the hall from the restaurant, but by the time our meal was done, so were we. There was quite a long line waiting to get into the bakery, and it wasn't moving very quickly.  What we did notice, was that when you go to sit at the bar, there are 2 steps up, and there is no handrail in the middle of this wide expanse. We saw two patrons stumble, and one of the waiters actually took a flat out fall. We may go back to give Buddy V's another try and since we now know the lay of the land, so to speak, we will be specific about where we want to be seated, and will order with a request for \"additional sauce on the side\". I'm from Jersey City NJ originally, so come on, Buddy, take a little constructive criticism to heart, from a neighbor who loves ya'!  :-)"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!

Great food and great dessert!
You must try the carbonara pasta!

and their molten cake and Italian bday cake dessert are to die for, I swear!"}
{"text":"I took my mom here for a Mother's Day lunch and we were not disappointed! I almost didn't give this place a shot because we did not like Carlo's bakery very much, but this place turned out to be so great! We were seated within 10 minutes and got a great table next to a window with a view of the strip and right next to the live music. Our waiter provided great service and my mom even got a flower for Mother's Day. We ordered the Salmon, Chicken Parm and Garlic Bread. All of it was so delicious! The salmon was cooked perfectly and the chicken was tender and juicy. The spaghetti had great flavor, I definitely recommend getting the extra Parmesan on top and adding some crushed red pepper! I also love that they offer unsweetened tea and come around to provide refills regularly. There are so many restaurants to choose from in Vegas, but I would probably go back here next time and try some other items off the menu. (The spaghetti in my picture looked prettier when it came out,  I messed it up)"}
{"text":"They gave me a rotten panzanella salad! They cheese was not fresh at all, and I was afraid to eat it. The rest of the salad was a flavorless bland combo of bread, cherry tomatoes, rotten romas and rotten cucumbers. It was disgusting. I tried to pick around the rotten produce and just eat the cherry tomatoes accidentally getting a rotten one in my mouth before spitting it out , not wanting to cause a scene... the waiter never came by for me to even tell them it was a health hazard!  

Also, I didn't even have bread to eat because they give you these tacky bread sticks in a plastic bag. Overall the worst experience at a restaurant I have ever had in Las Vegas, which is rare because there are a lot of amazing restaurants on the strip. I have never been served rotten food before. My husband's dish was bland small, flavorless and overpriced. 

Don't waste your money because Buddy is on TV (Cake Boss), his bakery is great, but his restaurant is terrible."}
{"text":"Buddy V's has always been great for us.  The food is very good and the brunch might be my favorite in Vegas.  The carbonara mac n cheese (I think is what it was) will have you battling your Nonna for the last bit in the bottom of the tray. 

It's great for the holidays too. We came here for Xmas and thanksgiving and they always do a special spread.

The wait staff is always incredibly friendly and fast, even if they can be a bit quirky.  One of them accidentally gave my girlfriend a backhanded compliment, realized his misstep, and then saved himself.  It was actually kinda funny.  The attitude of the wait staff we've had has been to make sure you have a fun experience along with excellent service.  And we haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"A must try when coming to Vegas! I tried the chicken Parmesan it was perfect, as well as the chicken piccata which was the best I've had so far. Meatballs were tender & flavorful as well as the polenta which tasted like butter. Waiter paired our wine to our meals & you have to try the Bombolinis!!!!! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place a 5, but no vegan options- not even sides on the dinner menu. Anyways, we had just ordered 3 orders (husband, daughter, and I) of spaghetti pomodoro, and our waitress asks if we are vegan, which we reply yes (she also mentioned she was vegan ). She immediately makes a suggestion which was AMAZING! It had veggies, pasta and they switched the pesto sauce with a tomato sauce! For dessert, she reminded us that the only vegan option was the sorbet! What amazing service and the foods was also astounding!

The atmosphere is casual. Not too busy (Thursday afternoon). Perfect to bring your kids!"}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations and they fell flat fast! Service slow and the food nothing like what I expected after reading positive reviews? The caprese salad was $16.00 and literally was 2 ounces of buffalo cheese with some wilted basil and a small spoonful of cherry tomatoes no seasoning big disappointment! The chicken parm that everyone raved  about tasted like something from Olive Garden but no seasoning and the Spaghetti on the side came cold no flavor .    Did not order dessert since everything was a big let down went to Bouchon for dessert! The bakery across the way looked very busy maybe should try that next time."}
{"text":"I am really surprised to read about poor service here. Our experience was completely opposite of that. This was quite possibly THE BEST service we've had in LV in the 4 days we've been here. Our waiter, Mourad, was beyond awesome!  Super attentive and responsive. We never had to ask for refills on drinks - plates were cleared magically-staff was friendly.  

The food: meatballs. Best I've had - even better than Mom's... shhh don't tell. 

Salmon: I'm from the PNW where the fish is amazing....this place rivals great seafood restaurants near Seattle. 

Chicken Parm:  Fork tender, sauce was perfect, pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly 

Cannolis:  fan-dam-tastic. 

If you like your meal, check out the bakery across the corridor!"}
{"text":"O. M. G. 
The food is so amazing and the service is great. Everything we ordered was served family style. I'm not sure if that's the norm, because I was there with my husband and a company dinner. We had some of everything. Lasagna, calamari, filets, scallops...and several more items. EVERYTHING was good. The lasagna and calamari were my favorite. So flavorful and presented beautifully. 

I am in Vegas a few more days and I will definitely be back for round two."}
{"text":"Awesome Restaurant! You must get the Caesar Salad with the polenta croutons then get the appetizer of the polenta croutons to go. The service is always good and you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"So the wife and I went to Buddy V's last night and here are my thoughts.  Overall it was a good dining experience, but not a great one.  I wasn't bowled over by either the service or the food, (except for the desert).  It was just kind of okay and most likely won't go back.
First off, the restaurant is tucked away in a spot that has a fantastic view of the Strip, but the internal design was emotionally cold.  I want an Italian-American restaurant to be warm and inviting and this place was trying too hard to be fancy, (which is most likely a result of its being in the Venetian). 
We didn't order any appetizers but for entrees my wife had the Veal Marsala and I had the Chicken Parm.  My wife and I both loved the taste of our meals.  They were both well prepared but both were a bit on the small side for the money they are charging. The Chicken Parm had only two cutlets and the side of spaghetti was only about a half a cup's worth.  Same with the wife's dish.  Like I said both tasted real good, but not really any better than any other Italian joint in town. Also, they give you fancy Focaccia bread with dinner.  Sadly they offer no butter or Olive oil to go with it and really, the bread had a distinctive taste to it, which made it non-optimal for dipping.  I'd rather have warm, fresh, and plain Italian bread over the fancy stuff. 
For desert we shared a Tiramisu and that was fantastic.  The quality and taste of it was spot on.  
As far as the service, the wait staff was very attentive.  Our waiter was professional but a bit stoic.  
We probably won't go back because I can get just as good Italian food from a local spot 10 minutes from my house but the desert was great so maybe it's worth it to try lunch there instead of dinner paired with desert."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch last week. Cost was about $50/pp with bottomless cocktails (included Bellinis, mimosas, Bloody Mary bar, and a few other choices I can't remember). I thought there could've been more food choices in the buffet. They had a crepe station but only offered two fillings, they had a decent mix of sweet and savory dishes to choose from though. We went up three times to refill our plates, and I enjoyed everything I ate. We loved the Bloody Mary bar! Such a cool addition! They also had live music which added a nice touch. I would recommend to anyone who loves a good brunch."}
{"text":"We didn't make a reservation on the night we stumbled upon Buddy V's inside the Venetian Hotel. It was a pleasant surprise as we have watched his family on tv for years. Adjacent to the Cake Boss bakery you will find the restaurant. The decor makes you feel like you are in Buddy's family kitchen with a trendy twist. First off, we were impressed with our servers knowledge of the restaurant, the beginning including how it all started, how it's grown, and Buddy's role in all of it. He seemed to really love working there and his passion for the company was inspiring. The menu is full of Italian comfort food dishes. A surprising twist to the evening was the lemon croutons on the salads, we ordered a side of them to indulge ourselves throughout dinner. The dessert menu is adorable, it looks like an old family photo album complete with pictures and the history of each recipe used. The personal touches Buddy and his family have put into this restaurant truly make you feel as if you were invited into his personal home. We are so thankful we stumbled upon this gem, and look forward to visiting again on our next trip to Vegas.  If you are a Buddy fan, this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"We went to Buddy's on a Thursday for dinner there was a group of about 10 of us the wait was about an hour and a half(which I understand with a large group) to be seated and another hour just to get our food out. I understand it's Vegas and all but the experience was not great especially when all we ordered was pasta it shouldn't have taken that long to get our food out. We overall spent 3 hours to be seated, get our food, and eat.  The restaurant wasn't very busy to have waited that long either. The food was fine but I didn't think it was worth it for the price."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly, one of the best meals I have had in Vegas.  The focaccia brought out first was delicious with oil and balsamic vinegar.  Grilled octopus as a starter was to die for.  So tender and flavorful, with a slice of grilled bread to soak up the sauce.  Followed by sea bass simply prepared with a super fresh salad alongside.  He had the veal Marsala and ate it all up.  The big downside was the live music, it was so freaking loud even though we were 2 rooms away, it really detracted from the dining experience.  The singer wasn't bad, just way too loud!"}
{"text":"My family owned an Italian deli/bakery for 26 years (9 of which I worked) so I know what homemade sauce, meatballs, sausage, etc tastes like.
 
With that being said, my girlfriend and I were very happy with our meals and exceptional service. Walked in around 5PM on a Tuesday night. We were quickly seated. We each ordered a sangria which shockingly were only $4 each since it was happy hour. They were delicious. Lots of good fruit in them. They were not cheapened because of HR.
 
We each ordered the same dinner, the rigatoni with lamb, pork, meatballs. and sausage. At a $26 price tag, I was very happy. Most Strip Italian places will charge $18+ just a plate of spaghetti alone. We meats were tender and delicious as was the sauce. The pasta, cook perfectly. Freshly baked bread was served before dinner as well. Again, delicious.
 
I look forward to returning. The service was as stellar as the food."}
{"text":"I love Cake Boss & Buddy so we went to his restaurant on our recent trip to Vegas. We were a group of 5 vegetarians. We ordered a couple antipastos & pastas. The service was good but the food was ok. Nothing was spectacular. We went with high expectations but were not impressed at all. For dessert we ordered Lisa's Nutella cake which was good. I will add that I liked the decor of the restaurant but that won't bring us back."}
{"text":"Excellent location with great service. The food was delicious and I enjoyed every bit of it. The tomato & basil soup was really great way to start off things and make sure you end it with their popular canoli. No complaints and honestly one of the better friendly services."}
{"text":"Celebrity chefs have let me down before in Vegas, but I was pleasantly surprised by Buddy V's. For a man known for his cake, he can dream up some good Italian food. 
You may be shocked by the prices at first (well probably not it is Vegas), but the dishes are served family style. Yes, you can realistically share a dish with someone else. (My exception to this would be the spaghetti.) The Cesar salad was crisp and coated in dressing and could easily be split between two or three. There are very few options for vegan's or people who don't want dairy, but you can opt for the Spaghetti Pomodoro. Usually, I do not like spaghetti at restaurants because most of the time I can DIY. However, the flavors of the sauce were fantastic. Super tasty my only gripe is that in comparison to everything else the portions were tiny. Luckily you can load up on the deliciously garlicky, buttery, and cheesy bread.
This place seems to stay pretty busy, so get there early. In a world of lackluster name driven Chef restaurants don't be affraid to take a chace on Buddy V's Ristorante."}
{"text":"Came in with my boyfriend for my birthday on January 19th. We had reservations at 7:00 and even though we were about 10 minutes early we were seated right away. I really liked our table as it was right next to the window overlooking the Strip. The restaurant was busy but not overly packed. 

This is where it started to go downhill. We sat for almost 15 minutes before my boyfriend had to flag down a busser to ask him to call our server. We hadn't even been poured water or given bread at all. The busser was nice enough to bring us both, telling us that our server would be right with us. 20 minutes goes by before our server even acknowledged our presence. What was really disturbing was that she was the waitress for the table directly next to us and had been walking right past us and using the register right next to us the whole time! I would not expect service like that from this type of establishment. Especially when it wasn't even very busy. 

We ordered the mac 'n' cheese carbonara for an appetizer and it did not disappoint. It was very tasty and just the right portion size for the two of us. I decided on the chicken parmesan while my boyfriend got the spaghetti and meatballs. The food came out quickly and was delicious. 

The only complaint was of the service and lack of attention from our server. Every time my boyfriend tried to get her attention to let her know it was my birthday she would ignore him. She seemed very preoccupied with a table of older men. I understand she saw a big tip but it kills the restaurant's reputation as there are many different groups of people who come in to dine. 

It was good but there are other Italian restaurants in LV that have better food and prices with much better service. I have to say it really bummed me out that this experience wasn't what we had hoped for as it was a special occasion that we had been looking forward to for some time."}
{"text":"Words cannot express how AMAZING our meal tasted! Dreams came true this day as we tasted Buddy's very own recipe. The ambiance was that of classy comfort, gorgeous staff, attentive service and PHENOMENAL food!!! I can't wait to go back to try more!"}
{"text":"The Cake Boss is everywhere these days and I am glad to see a place in Vegas. 

I made a reservation which you can do on line so getting a table was a snap. 

The chicken Parm was amazing, perfect breading and plenty of food. They give you spaghetti also. The food is absolutely fantastic. 

The lasagna is amazing also, perfect. The portions can be large however. 

Tried the garlic toast also and it was a perfect match. 

The staff are absolutely amazing, the waiter made a perfect recommendation for a wine to pair with the chicken Parm and knew the menu and food. There was also a couple assistants that kept everything flowing. This made everything work like a well oiled machine. The Cake Boss did an excellent job and I will be back if in Vegas again."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is super hard to find in the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes area. Locate Tao, then use the exterior door to get the covered balcony, hang a right and it's past Rock House. I'm usually good at navigating casinos but this place was hidden! Worth seeking out though.

Came in for Restaurant Week lunch menu with Lauren C- $20, 3 courses, $4 donation to Three Square food bank, so a win all around. As expected, they are spectacularly good at carbs here, from the house focaccia you are served upon seating to the polenta croutons in the Caesar. We shared the spaghetti and meatball and chicken parm entrees, both with more than ample pasta for a lunch portion with a great robust sauce and well-seasoned protein. I'm not much of a dessert person, but the NJ style cheesecake was well made and nicely accented by strawberry compote and chocolate almonds. 

Service was attentive and I really love the ambiance of the dining room. While this spot is hard to find, I'd come back to try more. As a local, RW is great for giving a discounted opportunity to try a place I otherwise wouldn't seek out (who voluntarily goes to the Strip these days?!), while giving back at the same time!"}
{"text":"Picked up 3 things during our stay in Vegas and took it back to our room. (Cant comment on service). 1. The Margarita pizza was the bomb! Very delicious. Decent size for the price.  2. The spaghetti central was so freakin good!!! Second best spaghetti Ive ever had. (First is Mama Depandis at RPM Italian in Chicago.) 3. The parm polenta is the best polenta Ive ever had hands down! Definitely will be coming back to this place on return trips to LV."}
{"text":"Holy cow. If you're not down to read this long review, the gist of it is: best buffet in Vegas hands down.

I came here for a comp'd Sunday Brunch buffet, which is normally priced at about $35 per person-- already pretty reasonable for the strip. But you're getting SUCH BETTER FOOD than you're finding at the standard all you can eat buffets in hotels. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The food is constantly being swapped out for fresh batches, and everything just TASTES homemade. The meats were the biggest surprise-- I don't think I've had meat that tasted that good and UNprocessed since visiting Europe... I'm not joking. The pastries were also fluffy and clearly created by an expert. 

There was a lot of variety though I did feel that the brunch leaned more lunch than breakfast... so know that coming in. The breakfast food was limited to regular scrambled eggs, \"Sunday Style\" eggs (with cheese and veggies mixed in), bacon and sausage options. Other food available was cheeses, meats, shrimp, pastas and a SLEW of desserts.  I tried getting a small taste of everything and there wasn't one thing I didn't like. I often have trouble with buffets where I grab a bunch of stuff on my plate but it doesn't necessarily taste great TOGETHER-- but that didn't happen here. Everything was very cohesive and worked well together no matter what you piled on your plate.

I highly recommend the Orichette pasta, the Carbonara Mac & Cheese, the sausages, and the croissants. You won't go wrong with any of the desserts-- but be sure you grab one of their famous cannolis!!"}
{"text":"Food = 5 stars
Overall = 3 stars

We had a very uneven experience at Buddy V's. The room was nice, but you really want a booth, as the tables had very uncomfortable-looking, unpadded chairs. Service was scattered and disorganized. Our server, Kacie, while very nice, seemed to be kinda all over the place, we had just sat down when she asked us if we were ready to order (??) and the bread service didn't arrive til after the entrees were served -- disappointing, as the restaurant had been open for long enough to smooth out those kinds of issues.

On the bright side, the food was excellent, we started with the meatballs, which were surprisingly light and tasty, with a nicely seasoned red sauce. I had the whole wheat penne pasta with pesto and veggies, delicious with a lot of flavor but still light. Hubby had the shrimp scampi with perfectly cooked shrimp and angel hair pasta and a light and flavorful sauce. 

The prices were pretty good for Vegas so we felt we had a good value, but it was really too bad that the overall experience didn't match the quality of the food. With so many options in Vegas, I doubt we would be back."}
{"text":"Made a reservation and when we get there the hostess said we will be right there and then was joined by 4 other coworkers and just continued to talk and have a private conversation instead of getting us seated ( I thought you were at work but clearly we are on your time) 
Happy hour is good but the staffing in the bar area was slow! Poor girl was all by herself in the lounge area and you could tell she needed back up. Food was good though, smaller portions."}
{"text":"This place surprised us with how good it was. We just shared a ton of appetizers between 4 of us-salumi & cheese board,  mozzarella carozza and meatballs. The sauce was out of this world and the mozzarella carozza was all around amazing, to the point that even as full as we were I couldn't let any be left over. I hear they have a great happy hour which unfortunately timing wise we missed. This was definitely a winner and would be interested to try some of the actual entrees and pizza/pasta."}
{"text":"One of my Italian Food places ever! First of all, the best dessert I've ever tasted in my life....Italian Birthday Cake is the bomb and a must have! I just wish Buddy would open a place in LA, so us Southern Californian's could partake in the flavors of his families recipes ! His Chicken Parmigiana is outstanding, (order extra sauce!) and the Chicken PIccata is my husband's favorite. We love the feel of the restaurant, the view is beautiful, (although we hate that it's in Sheldon Adelson's place), and we try to make sure we stop there every time we're in Vegas. We even ordered meals to go last time we were there....and the restaurant packaged everything up beautifully for our drive. Order your desserts when you're dining at the restaurant, and you can skip the line across the way at the Bakery."}
{"text":"We had a nice and delicious dinner earlier tonight. We had the spaghetti with clams and prawns, fried scallops, spaghetti carbonara, and a cannoli for dessert, all to share among 3 of us. The only thing that I don't like was the ambience. It's a noisy restaurant. Service was good and helpful."}
{"text":"We checked out Buddy V's for their weekend brunch buffet.  I love Italian food so this buffet was perfect IMO.  It is not overwhelming big, but has just enough to have a bit of everything.  There is also an option to add on endless wine, beer or mimosas.  The stations include an antipasto bar with cheeses, charcuterie, salads and veggies.  The carving station cooked up Italian sausages and breakfast meats.  The hot food station included Italian style scrambled eggs, pancakes and of course pasta!  My favorite part was the dessert spread with favorites like tiramisu and mini cannoli. I left feeling satisfied, not overly full, and felt I tried everything without having to waste.  The decor and ambiance is also really cool with and open kitchen."}
{"text":"Came here for the great happy hour menu. $4 sangria was excellent! Ordered the cheese and charcuterie board (not on the happy hour menu), and it came with a good portion of three different meats and cheeses, olives, and delicious grilled bread slices. We devoured the bread, and they immediately brought us more! There was live music, and they took requests, which provided a great atmosphere. We already had dinner plans elsewhere, but we had to try their desserts. We shared the lobster tail pastry and the warm Nutella cake with salted caramel ice cream. The lobster tail was amazing, with perfectly flaky layers and a sweet creamy filling, served with berries on the side. The Nutella cake didn't have as much Nutella flavor as we were hoping, but delicious nonetheless. The real star was the salted caramel ice cream! Would love to come back again and stay for dinner, as everything looked delicious."}
{"text":"We were quickly seated for lunch. Prices were average for Vegas, but the food was so delicious I would have paid more. Eggplant parm amazing! Salad and carbonara what dreams are made of. The waitstaff was very attentive, great meal"}
{"text":"I had my heart set on Chicken Parm for lunch. I was extra excited to find the best lunch deal i've seen on the Strip here at Buddy's included chicken parmigiana. Boss' Express Lunch for $22 got us an antipasto, main entree and dessert. For a starter, Grandma's meatballs were tender and sat in a bed of tomato ragu. The much anticipated chicken parm was a little on the dry side but nothing a little more sauce could've helped with. It was just the right amount of food. My heavy lunch was offset by the refreshing lemon sorbet with biscotti. Very strong lemon flavor, it was good! I would also suggest the Panzanella - i tried a few bites and it was a really great salad if you're looking for something lighter to start your meal with.

Fun touches related to baking and family incorporated into the decor. Ceiling lightbulbs encased in mixer whisks, rolling pin structures and at home pictures on the brick walls. Big restaurant and comfortable, family vibe. Huge fan of Buddy's show Cake Boss. Was hoping to catch him but maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious dinner with my husband. The Venetian Hotel is a sight to see and the food at Buddy Vs was incredible- possibly the best I've ever had. I had the Bronzino and my husband had the chicken parm- Wow. My martini was incredibly good. No dessert- we were super satisfied from our dinner."}
{"text":"Went to Buddy V's for my birthday dinner and it was the best decision I could've made!!! Dinner was amazing and service top notch!  Our waiter was very attentive and made us feel like home.

We tried the garlic bread, chicken Marsala and the lasagna and they exceeded our expectations, big portions and delicious taste! 

Also, they have the best tiramisu I've ever tried and I can't wait to go back to have some!!"}
{"text":"We went back this morning for Sunday brunch and it was good. Not great but good. It was lacking in variety. The Mac and Cheese was yummy, as was the hot pasta salad. There was a small selection of cut meats and cheeses and some tasty meatballs and my husband was thrilled with the carving area. But the crepes weren't very good (no matter how much Nutella I loaded on) and the blueberry muffins and chocolate croissant were dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Had the Philly sandwich for lunch and it was amazing..  Service was great.. Diffently want to come back for lunch again.."}
{"text":"My wife and kids love watching \"Cake Boss\" and I usually always stay at Venetian/Palazzo so when I heard Buddy opened up a restaurant there I knew I had to go.  They had only been open about 10 days or so when my friends and I went so I did take that into consideration when writing this review.  Upon entering the restaurant I felt that the decor was quite nice.  They have framed family photos all around the walls which gives it a \"homey\" feel.  Even though some of the prices may be creeping close to fine dining prices the cuisine is not fine dining (which I like btw).  The whole table had the Jersey City style fried Mozzarella, margarita pizza, chicken parm, warm nutella cake, and XL lobster tail dessert.  I really enjoyed the fried mozzarella as it was not breaded like traditional fried mozzarella but rather sandwiched between two prices of bread.  The pizza is nothing special to me and did not stand out compared to the same style of pizza at other restaurants.  The chicken parm was a good portion which came with pasta that really did taste homemade.  My friends thought the Lisa's warm nutella cake was the best dessert they have had in their lives!  The service was spoty and our waiter would be gone for long periods of time but the busboy always made sure we had what we needed.  I chalk that up just to being a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Peter was the best server! So attentive, knowledgeable of wine and menu... and awesome service! He knew I was a teacher and comped us a free dessert for Teacher Appreciation month! So thoughtful! Food was delicious as well! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the service is 5 star. Very friendly and enjoyable atmosphere. Christian was the best server. We will be back on our next trip to Vegas.  Great location across from Carlo's Bakery."}
{"text":"A really great Italian restaurant here at the Venetian.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  Terrific food & even better service.  When they offer three types of olives for a martini, that's top-drawer."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful, but the service was terrible.This restaurant would have had five stars if it were not for the poor service. It took 20 minutes for a waiter to come to our table, Then the waiter asked us if we wanted bread, because they brought bread to everyone's table, but our's was different it was a garlic cheese bread that we did not order and he charged us for it.  So the food was great, service terrible!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Buddy v's (in Las Vegas) because we knew we were going to have a great cannoli but we ended up having such a great time. The staff was so warm and friendly we decide to go there the next day for dinner; so we canceled our other reservations and it was five stars across the board. I would recommend this restaurant to any person."}
{"text":"Als ich in Las Vegas reise, war ich den ganzen Nachmittag bei Venezianischen. Zum Nachmittagskaffee war ich hier in Buddy V's. Die Leute hier sind sehr nett. Ich sitze neben dem Fenster und habe Tiramisu bestellt. Es war sehr speziell und bisschen anders als ich in Italien probierte. Aber es ist super lecker und lohnt sich zu probieren."}
{"text":"I just returned home from a trip to Las Vegas with a girlfriend of mine. One of the highlights of our trip was to go to the Carlo's Bakery and Buddy Restaurant. Although the treats at the bakery were amazing we were extremely disappointed by how we were treated by one of the male wait staff at the restaurant. We are in our mid twenties and I feel like he didn't respect us as customers. We ordered a few cocktails as well as the cheeseboard. It was not a pleasant experience and I don't know if you will see this but I think everyone should be treated fairly dining at the restaurant (also the opening time on the website is wrong). That part of our trip was ruined. I love the show and am a huge fan."}
{"text":"Best place ever! We tried the express menu, from the soup to the dessert, everything was awesome. Definitely worth trying if you are on the strip."}
{"text":"Ordered calamari (4), lasagna(3), egg plant parm (3), cheese bread (4),cannolis (2), and the bread pudding (5) which was the best thing we ate on our visit! I would definitely recommend coming to this place for that bread pudding but the food itself is just okay, nothing out of this world. Service was great and fast on a Tuesday afternoon (about 1pm) where we did not have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Glorified Olive Garden....the dishes resemble that of a similar American knock off. This is the place for all those pasta loving eaters; however, for the prices, the dishes are no different than something you might find elsewhere for a lower price. The service seemed to be quite busy which made getting the check at the end of dinner seem endless."}
{"text":"My husband and I are really picky about our spaghetti sauce and Buddy V's nailed it! It was like eating at your Italian grandmother's house. The meatballs tasted homemade along with the bolognese sauce. Calamari batter was crispy and light, not to mention the delicious pizza (I recommend Buddy's Favorite). Don't forget the famous Carlo's Bakery cannolis. Everything was so amazing including the service. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  I am so happy we decided to try Buddy's.  I had a feeling it would be good but it was way better then expected!  My hubby and I both got the early special for $38.  You choose a starter, entree, and dessert.  Hubby got the meatballs and I got the Caesar salad.  The meatballs we so freaking moist! And the sauce was perfect!  The salad...probably some of the best dressing I have ever had and the polenta croutons! OMG!  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, so yummy!

Then for our entree hubby got the carbonara and I got the chicken parm.  Both were amazing!  Pasta was cooked perfectly, the carbonara was creamy and rich, the chicken was moist and crispy, just...yes!  And then there was dessert.  I couldn't even finish my meal so we got the warm Nutella cake there and the cannoli to go.   The Nutella cake with ice cream was like heaven on a plate!  And we are still so full so we haven't tried it yet but I'm dreaming about it haha!  This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Best place to spend your birthday ! Staff is really friendly and food is delicious we cleaned every plate ~ not something I usually do. Italian birthday cake was amazing as well and it was nice that they brought it out with a candle .. thank you so much!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this new LV restaurant because we are huge Cake Boss fans. We should have asked for the dessert menu first because the appetizers and entrees were just okay. I'd recommend just coming for the desserts! Sorry Buddy. The food was fair. Location is very nice- can't beat the Venetian. Nice atmosphere. A tad pricey for our family's budget, but expected for a LV strip restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here because we saw it when we went to the bakery ro get a canoli. Best experience ever at this restaurant. The calamari is delicious here the chicken parm with the side of spaghetti is delicious. The drinks here were amazing shout out to danny our bartender. Im glad i came here. Will be back before we go back home."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, especially bc the owner is the star of TLC's reality show 'Cake Boss.' I had high expectations, but unfortunately, they were not met. 

I took the safe route and ordered Chicken Parmesan. This dish is pretty difficult to mess up since it's so common and every Italian restaurant has it. But to my surprise, it was just....Bleh. Nothing spectacular about it. Tasted better everywhere else. 

I was with 7 other girls, who ordered a variety of dishes. All didn't seem wow'ed at all, too. Two girls ordered the same thing (forgot what they ordered), but one girl's dish was way more salty than the other. We all had a taste of both girls' dish and agreed. 

Service was also just.... Bleh. Whenever we asked our waiter for something, he had a lame excuse why it couldn't be done or if it can be done, he would take forever to do so. One thing I don't like is how they can't split up checks. Even very small restaurants don't have problems with splitting checks now a days. I also don't like paying a lot for food that's less than mediocre. 

I must add though that their dessert menu looked amazing. Too bad none of us were in a mood to try anything. I MIGHT be back to try out a dessert or two when I make it out here again to L.V."}
{"text":"Nothing touches this food. Nothing. This is the one restaurant I recommend in Vegas over everything. You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you're in Vegas & looking to eat Italian & don't come here. Don't break the bank at Rao's or Carmine's or some other fine dining Italian restaurant. Eat at the place that feels like home but has the quality of food that can compete with the more expensive places. At those places you're going to pay extra for noodles with your parm. At Buddy V's it's all included for a lower base price. 

I'm not going to give a review based on a specific experience because each time I've gone it's been nothing but the best. Girlfriend and I love it. We start with the meatballs that will blow your mind; I order the chicken parm & she orders something new every time. While you wait, piping hot, fresh bread is delivered to you with classic oils for dipping; however, I'm a much bigger fan of dipping it in the meat sauce that comes with the meatballs. Red wine to wash it all down & I am a very happy man. 

Aesthetically, the restaurant feels like someone's home; classic oldies & doo wop are played throughout the restaurant. Seating has never been an issue for me even when I go at 6 or 7 PM on a Friday or Saturday. Restaurant may be packed, but there's plenty of bar seating. 

Two entrees, an appetizer & a glass of wine runs you roughly $70. Kinda pricey, but well worth it. Servings are huge. Most restaurants in Vegas will run you close to that amount anyways. You came to the wrong city if you're looking to pinch pennies and be frugal."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely spectacular in every sense and I highly recommend anyone visiting Vegas to pay Buddy a visit! I made a reservation after reading the great reviews on yelp. The restaurant is classy yet casual. The ambiance is welcoming and doesn't make you feel like you are entering a \"yuppie\" restaurant. We were seated very quickly with my reservation. The kitchen is open so you can see the workers cooking and it is super clean. Smells delicious! I ordered a wine which was good. We had the mozzarella pesto bread as an appetizer. So good!!! Ok let's get to the meal. I had the rigatoni a la vodka. It was to die for! My partner ordered the chicken parm. It was so good too! We ate so much we couldn't get dessert. I'm sure those are delicious as well. Our waitress Kacie was very friendly and fast with service. I highly highly recommend this place. Buddy, great job!!"}
{"text":"3 words: Creekstone Farms Burger. Amazing. Cooked to perfection, flavorful, and delicious. I seek out Creekstone Farms meat because it's open range, organic, and also happens to be Halal. I called and was told quickly that they do indeed serve Creekstone Farms Beef burgers. 

Locating the restaurant was a little tricky but a couple directions later we made it. Inside is beautifully laid out, while not overly fancy, it is classy. 

We were seated in a clean red booth immediately and drinks brought right away. The burger was $16. I asked to have the meat cooked away from pork and the server kindly let me know that the only pork they cook is in the meatballs in a pot. The grill only cooks shellfish and steak. Super nice. 

Burgers came out with Parmesan fries. Asked for pickles and had them right away. Drinks filled automatically. No breadsticks or other food while you wait. There are some really thin straw like bread sticks on the table that are average. 

But all in all, a fantastic experience for lunch. Will definitely be returning on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Jolie déco et bon service, mais c'est tout : garniture annoncée non présente dans le plat, cher pour la qualité et la quantité, se dit italien mais ne sait pas faire de carbonara italienne."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Buddy's V's. Food was great staff the same would highly recommend if you are in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I'll describe Buddy V's in 1 word...perfect. From the Caesar salad, the broccoli rabe / sausage rigatoni, the Bronzino to the Tiramisu, everything was bursting in flavor, perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. A most enjoyable experience.  I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars on Yelp, but Buddy V's is well deserving. Don't hesitate making reservations. Incredible!"}
{"text":"1st visits to Buddy V and I'm thinking of making it a regular spot on my quarterly visits to Vegas, service was good, food great and drinks on point. So happy I made a reservation because it seems as waiting it unpleasant."}
{"text":"My husband and myself researched this place before we came on our trip. This place looked like it would be delicious. Since I liked watching buddy v's show I expected big things. Well I was soarly mistaken. We ordered the carving board. The cold cuts at my local Kroger's are way better. All of the food we ordered was terrible."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian done family style. Love this place food is always great. Must try the calamari and mamas meatballs"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken parm and the bf had lasagna.  We also ordered the fries. Chicken parm was very good. Nice and crispy and the inside was juicy.  My bf said the lasagna was the 2nd best he's had,  his Italian moms is number 1. From hostess to waitress to server everyone was very nice and attentive.  Everyone seemed happy to be there making our visit much more pleasant."}
{"text":"I wanted to rave about this place, but it was middle of the road Italian food for me, nothing special or memorable and not really worth a second visit due to the service and prices. I had to ask for ice cubes in my water, asked for bread twice, lemons for my water twice, ranch for my son twice. It just wasn't the wow factor I expected for pricey Italian food."}
{"text":"Very casual place. The food was delicious, we had Caesar salad, eggplant parmigan and chicken parmessan. The food took awhile to come out, but the wait staff were very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food. Comfy interiors and friendly servers. We had a good bottle of wine that our server recommended, and even though it wasn't one we originally wanted, it was fabulous! We shared a salad and pizza, along with a dessert, and we were full."}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant with many homage's to Buddy's family. I love his show, so I wanted to try his food- got the prix fixe meal with the Cesar salad, chicken parm, and cannolli. The ceasar salad was super good and had polenta croutons. Our attendant (not the waiter) was AWESOME! He kept our waters full, and came by with more bread. Our waiter, was just okay. He was super chatty with other tables, and he tried to up-sell everything. Kind of felt a little pushy at times. Overall, we had a great time. Just had a horrible view of the Trump tower when we went but a cool view of the Strip. Ain't nobody wants to look at that tower while they're dining. But that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow this place was really good. I had the carbonara and it was one of the best carbonara's I've had which says a lot since it's usually my go to at Italian restaurants. We order Buddy's favorite pizza for the kids to share and it was excellent as well.  Finished with Lisa's chocolate cake and the cake was good but the salted ice cream that came with it was amazing. Service was good too. They got us seated at our reservation time and didn't rush us out which was nice since we were dining with extended family."}
{"text":"The express lunch menu was a great value for the quality and quantity of food. Choice of appetizer/salad, entree and dessert.  Chicken Parmesan and spaghetti with Bolognese sauce was excellent. Service was fantastic. Beautiful and yummy deserts."}
{"text":"When here for my mom's 60th birthday and was pleasantly delighted. The service was fantastic and the food was delicious. 

I ordered the lasagna, while pricy, is the best I've had in town and the portion was huge. So, it was well worth it. In fact, I could have and should have saved half as a leftover; however, I couldn't stop eating."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this restaurant listed in RESTAURANT WEEK!! I've been wanting to come here anyway & this was the perfect opportunity. A 3 course dinner for only $30.14!! I had Grandma's Meatballs for my app & Chicken Parm as my entree. Restaurant week's portion came with 4 meatballs. 2 pieces of chicken & a small but good size spaghetti. Both were just amazing. So much flavor in the meatballs & you can see the herbs when you cut into it. The breading on the chicken parm was perfect. Not too thick so it's not filling. The spaghetti sauce was simple & delicious. Mini donuts as the dessert with a chocolate & raspberry I think it was sauce to dip. 5 small pieces I believe. Spiced sugar coating the outside of the donut. 

The specialty cocktail list was awesome! Everything looked good! I ordered the DRAGO ROSSO-absolut ruby red, pomegranate, jalapeño & mango. A spicy treat! I've always wanted to try a spicy cocktail & this one was amazing. I had to take small sips cause my throat burned a little! The jalapeño seeds were floating at the top too. I think I should have asked the bartender to not make it that spicy. But it was good! Priced at $14. 

The restaurant is beautiful! It's huge. The kitchen was open so you can watch them cook (love that). Brick walls & floor to ceiling windows with great views of the Strip. There are old pictures everywhere & cool decor. Unique chandeliers & a great wine shelf! We had a great table next to the window :) 

Service was great! Everyone was so nice. I even got a birthday dessert from them with a sparkler attached! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very solid food and service. Not the best, not the worst, but also better than \"okay\".  When you think Italian food this could definitely come to mind. They serve fairly decent sized portions. I ordered the chicken parmigiana, which was very good. I sort have expected when I ordered garlic bread that it would be knots and not just bread covered in cheese, garlic and herbs. It was served with the main course, which was kind of pointless, I would have liked to get the garlic bread before the main course. Anyway, the place was definitely solid, decent price, I would recommend it and I would return if I want good Italian food next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Buddy V's Ristorante has a variety of great tasting Italian food. 

I loved the atmosphere, it was welcoming and personal. While waiting to get a table, I hung out in the bar area which was very spacious and had great waitresses. I had a Moscow mule, it was pretty decent. 

They got us a table in 35 minutes, which was exactly what they estimated. I got a Caesar side salad, which was decent. I wasn't super fond of the croutons. We also got garlic cheese bread, which was very tasty. 

My main dish was eggplant parmesan, with a side of spaghetti. I really enjoyed the eggplant, it was presented very nice as well. I also liked the spaghetti sauce. Since it was my birthday, they brought me a delicious birthday dessert. I must say, it was probably one of the best desserts I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Delicious. The food was delicious. I had the Sunday sauce and it was amazing. Probably enough for two, so I had food waste guilt. The caesar was good, weird croutons, not really croutons but slightly crisped focaccia pieces... not so good. But the salad and dressing were great. But that sunday sauce......  yum."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple appetizers. Loved his famous meatballs - not to heavy - lots of flavor! We were offered a pitcher of sangria, drank the whole delicious thing! They then offered to clean and box the pitcher as a souvenir! Nice!! Their Birthday cake was a wonderful way to top off a great appetizer snack! Worth every penny! Go - enjoy!"}
{"text":"Calamari is mediocre, like many other places in Vegas it is overhyped. They are not flexible. Bread is very tasty with oil and vinegar. The main attraction is the desserts. The Caesar salad has delicious cornbread croutons that are soft. Chicken Parmesan is well made not anything special. The chicken piccata is excellent and very flavorful. Tomato Basil soup is well but not anything special. The lasagna is on par with several franchise locations nothing extravagant. The Nutella cake taste like any other chocolate cake I could faintly taste the Nutella. The salted carmel Ice cream and raspberry sherbet is excellent and has a unique flavor. The cannoli is very good as well and is a must to order if you come here
I will say the service is excellent. Waiters are very attentive and are aware of their customers desires and level of drinks. The service is very friendly and insightful on the menu.      
In conclusion many of the dishes are very normal tasting. The desserts are very good overall. It is overpriced for what you get in respect to food but I say it's good to try once. If you are in for the deserts the bakery across has the same ones but will have a long wait."}
{"text":"Delicious food and superb service. Our waiter Peter provided us with excellent and impressive service.  We ordered the grilled salmon, shrimp scampi, clams with linguini, and the cheese ravioli. Would definitely recommend!!!!
One of best restaurants in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I RARELY go out for Italian food. Why? Well, because we can make most of the dishes at home with high quality ingredients. Well, when I had some family in town, I suggested all of us going to Buddy V's only because :1. Pit stop at Carlo's Bakery; 2. It's easy for me to get back on the I-15 to head back to suburbia. 3. Italian food is always safe when entertaining guests.
Well, my cousins decided to day drink while waiting for me to get off of work, so by dinner time, they were fighting off a massive hangover. And it wasn't even 5 PM. Then they blew us off. 
The hubs and I decided to take advantage of our time together with our diva because we both had lobster tails from Carlo's Bakery on our mind. We figured, dinner was going to be a bonus, so I don't have to cook and clean, and we made the trek from suburbia to the Strip. 
We checked in for our reservation and was seated within a couple of minutes. When I made the reservation, I requested a table along the windows for the view. I noticed all the tables along the windows were designed for larger parties and I was prepared for them to seat us at a smaller table since our party decreased from 6 to 3. But no, they get a high five for seating our party of 3 at the  primo table that had a view of the Strip as well as a view of Carlo's Bakery so we can keep an eye on our number. 
Our server, was personable, just a tad slow. I'll take 'a tad slow' over crappy personality any day.
We ordered:
Kids Margharita Pizza
Grandma's meatballs
Caesar salad
Chicken Parmesan
Agnolotti

I enjoyed  everything that we ordered. I thought the pizza crust was outstanding; thin, crunch AND chewy, perfect amount of sauce and cheese. The meatballs were heavenly. The Caesar salad took us by surprise. When it arrived at the table, we thought the salad looked dry. But when we took our first bite, we understood why it looked like it was dry. It was one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had. It didn't need all that dressing because each bite had the perfect amount of acid, garlic, cheese and saltiness from the anchovies. The croutons were unique; I forgot to ask but I think it was made out of polenta. The croutons were perfect to dip with the meatballs. I had the Chicken Parmesan; it was good not great. MY hub's agnolottis were divine. Hand made, they were filled with veal shank, sausage and pork with a creamy, sage brown butter. The one complaint I had was I thought the agnolotti pastry was a tad thick but the flavors were very good. 
All together, we spend $113 with tip for 2 adults and a princess. A tad high for a family dinner, but overall, it was a great experience for us. Too bad my cousins were too drunk. But that's what you do in Vegas."}
{"text":"A little disappointed as I had expected great food! Do not order grilled cheese pesto sandwich! Awful ! Meatballs were average ! 
The orange sponge cake on the other hand was awesome! One of the best cake I've e ever had!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a small dinner and was blown away by the food and the service. The Eggplant Parmesan was absolutely amazing and the Garlic Bread was just fantastic. The service was wonderful and very attentive, and the live music was a wonderful bonus.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Going against my diet was so worth it! Lol. I went here with coworkers with the idea that I would eat healthy but saw the menu and that all went out the window. I couldn't visit an Italian restaurant and not have pasta! 

I shared some calamari for my appetizer and skipped a salad to save room for the main dish. I ordered the chicken rigatoni with a tomato based cream sauce. Omg it was delicious. I tried not to eat it all and failed miserably. The sauce really makes the dish. You probably won't have room for dessert but try to chicken rigatoni and you will leave happy!"}
{"text":"Restaurant week lunch menu 2015 review 

The Skinny: maybe I just don't get it but the food is okay,  not great... Surprisingly their dessert was the worst course and cannot recommend. (3) service is good and prompt (3) value: it was okay for Restaurant week special but I would skip this place at regular prices. 

We came in to try their restaurant week lunch menu which serves a 3 course lunch for $20.15. 

I got her Caesar salad,  grilled salmon over a cucumber/chickpea/artichoke salad while the hubs got the tomato basil soup and spaghetti and meatballs.  Both came with a dessert course of cannoli and cookie selection. 

The tomato basil soup was a little too bland and needed more basil. The texture was good.

I liked the Caesar salad better albeit it was a little heavy on the dressing and needed more acidity. The hubs thought there was a little too much anchovy in the dressing but I kind of like that. The polenta croutons were a great addition textural and flavorful. 

Spaghetti and meatballs was really nothing special and the sauce was too bland -  there really wasn't enough tomato flavour to really make this dish stand out. The meatballs were under seasoned. The spaghetti itself was cooked a bit beyond al dente which in a dish like this,  makes it disappointing. 

My salmon dish fared better. The grilled salmon was done perfectly. However the salad of cucumber,  arugula,  chickpea and artichokes was a bit underwhelming and needed more acidity/brightness to bring the flavors together. 

The worst course was dessert. It each came with a cannoli and 3 cookies -  oatmeal, chocolate chip and sugar cookie. The cinnamon cannoli was okay albeit rich...there wasn't enough cinnamon in there to really distinguish itself. The cookies were really bad -  they did not have that rich buttery taste to them. The sugar cookie especially tasted more like shortening and artificial flavors. I think they also skimp out and use cheap artificial vanilla extract.

After we finished lunch I was watching the bakers at Carlos bakery. Guess what I saw? A half used package of pre-made manufactured Rice Krispies treats with the shiny blue foil packaging and Kelloggs branded elves (see the pic). Seriously. As a bakery,  you cannot make rice krispie treats yourselves? (Just FYI, all you need is a microwave,  marshmallows,  butter,  rice krispie cereal, a bowl,  a spatula and 10 minutes to make this dessert). To me,  that is just bad form. 

At the end of the day, I give the dining experience a 3 star -  it's okay but nothing I would return for. As for Carlos bakery -  just the cookies and the aforementioned shortcut I saw are enough for me to stay far away."}
{"text":"So I can't say I love the fact that Buddy's feels very much like its part of a mall. I think it's due to the fact that the entranceway is huge. The open floor plan just makes the restaurants main Dining area feel like it's right in the middle of the mall. However despite this minor flaw the food here is authentic. Our waiter was from Naples and had a true passion for the food he was serving. Our apps were delicious including the Caesar salad and calamari. The meatballs were top notch. For dinner I ordered the mixed meats with pasta. The dish had a name but I can't remember for the life of me what it was called. The lamb was fatty though which is why I can't go to five stars. Plus the dish was missing a component in my opinion. Like maybe some cheese or vegetables. My friends dishes all looked good. No one seemed   blown away but we were definitely satisfied and impressed by the cleanliness and authentic Italian cuisine we were served."}
{"text":"Solid Italian dining option at the Venetian. The staff is all top notch and the food was pretty good. We had sangria to drink which was good and then a really fresh and delicious salad for an appetizer. My entree was the chicken rigatoni alla vodka - I thought this was ok although I have had better vodka pasta elsewhere. My two friends rated their entrees highly. Overall, a solid option that probably won't dissapoint but it did not blow me away."}
{"text":"Amazing place! In terms or prices, its on the more affordable side of Italian food in Vegas (but still runs about $20-$30 a plate), and is worth every single penny! Our waiter was the most amazing person, he was very attentive, personable, and charming, and made the experience here the amazing experience it was. The style of the restaurant is very charming and cute as well, and the environment was perfect for a night now while still being relaxing and comfortable. The proportions on the food were well worth the money too, I ordered chicken parmesan, which came with two huge pieces of chicken. The three other people in my party ordered other chicken, and every single one of us had to take home more than half our meal. Would highoy recommend to anyone looking for a good meal, this was the best we had on our Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience! We reserved a table through Open Table and we didn't have to wait at all. We had a nice booth near the open kitchen. The wait staff was attentive and nice. Both of our dishes, chicken piccata and chicken Marsala were both amazing, film of flavor and perfect portions. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Service was A+. The food we ordered was good, but not \"great\", though we wouldn't mind returning and trying some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was delicious, the creme brulee is to die for!  Service was fast and courteous.  Atmosphere was a little loud for me, but it's pretty good for a restaurant on the strip"}
{"text":"Went to the Venetian to find a good place for dinner and I am extremely happy this was the lucky spot we decided on. Drinks were perfect and our meals were delicious. This place can be as casual or formal as you want it to be. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice italian meal that won't break your wallet, still in a trendy setting!"}
{"text":"Plainly speaking, this restaurant looks nice, the food is fairly good and the service is above par, but you pay a very high price for eating here.

So, if you are okay with or need to impress someone by spending about double what you would normally pay for a good, but rather run-of-the-mill and somewhat small portioned Italian meal, then you will likely be satisfied with your experience here.

Otherwise, you'll probably feel like what I felt afterwards. No longer hungry, but not particularly impressed.

We had the panzanella, turkey dinner, linguine and clams, cannolis and apple crostata. The panzanella was good, but we wished there was more than the four small slices of cheese on it. The turkey dinner was good. Was it $24 good? Not so sure. The linguine and clams was somewhat overpowering with the spices. Is linguine and clams supposed to make you sweat? Apple crostata was pretty darn tasty. Easily the highlight of our meal. The cannolis? Seeing as how the cannolis are seemingly a signature type thing, you'd think they would wow. They didn't wow us. They're good cannolis for a Hoboken bakery. But for a $$$ restaurant in the Venetian? For $$$ it needs to be BETTER than \"home cooking\"."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were so looking forward to the food and the experience.  I will say it was very busy and we got right in to our table.  The wait staff is amazing!!! they were so attentive and they were never missing in action.  The lasagna was to die for and the portion was enough for 4 people.  If anyone is going there get the lasagna you will think you have died and gone to heaven.   For dessert we had the lobster claw with cream and berries again outstanding and enough for two people to share.  They also let you reserve on line. 

I would suggest that you take full advantage of that.  Some days are harder to get into the restaurant than others.  And online reservation makes it more convenient.    I would also suggest that you don't go home with out visiting Carlos Bakery which is located just across from the restaurant   I am going there again very soon and they also have a Happy Hour menu with lots of specials especially for all the locals."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Excellence at its best. The Assistant General Manager Adam Margolies was very professional and made my daughter's 12th birthday a very special occasion. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Decided on Buddy V's after looking into all the great restaurants on the Strip. Prices are reasonable for a \"famous person's'\" restaurant. Sat at a table with a view of the open kitchen.  Thin breadsticks individually wrapped at each table.  Great calamari fritters appetizer. Crispy and nice marinara sauce on the side. Ordered Clams and linguini.  They were ok.. chewy clams, very light on garlic, but substantial portion. Friend ordered vodka sauce rigatoni with chicken.  Good sauce, chicken breast a little tough but all around not bad. We opted not to have dessert with our meal since we were full and instead went 'across the street' to Carlo's Bake Shop. I've never been to the original one in New York, but I'm guessing they serve many of the same items in Vegas. It was just as crowded as the restaurant if not more.  There is a large window to view the pastry chefs/bakers decorating the cakes - a great way to pass the time while you are waiting to get your desserts."}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks! We had the meatballs and the eggplant Parmesan. The staff members were all friendly and efficient. We hope to go back before we leave Vegas."}
{"text":"Nothing special - it's like Maggiano's or Carmine's but not as good

Best parts are the service and the desserts"}
{"text":"Restaurant is huge, doesn't give you the warm feeling that an Italian restaurant should have in my opinion.

Food and drinks took forever, server was very polite but could make up the fact that everything took a very long time to get to the table.

We had the caprese and the panzanela salad, both were ok, nothing out of the ordinary.

For an entree I had the veal Marsala, comes with a side of linguine which was flavorless. Veal itself was decent but nothing that would impress.

Desserts was the only salvageable items that we had, cannoli and lobster tail made me give them 2 stars.

Would not return to this place, there's other Italian places that are much better."}
{"text":"There food was delicious! There sauce was soooo good, but the the portion sizes are extremely small, very pricey for the size but other than that this place is perfect, great atmosphere, great food, what more could you want."}
{"text":"Very hard to find such a friendly place, even the chef came out to greet us! Shoutout to Chef Forgione. Great view and tasty food. The garlic bread and meatballs are a must!"}
{"text":"The best meatballs I have ever had. Food was good and the service was excellent. The portion sizes are great and the prices a very good for being on the strip. I come here every time."}
{"text":"Two stars because the service was horrible. We waited for over 20 minutes when we were first seated to have a waitress come over. Food was good. Trying to pay bill was a nightmare. 20 minutes and still waiting!"}
{"text":"We amazing got a order to go chicken piccata and it was amazing. I also went over to Carlos's bakery and took baked items to go and chocolate strawberries they were awesome thank you so much service was great and the bartender was very friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat at if you want authentic tasting Italian food while you are visiting Las Vegas. The service was amazing & the food was even better. And on top of that the drinks are strong. My group had the garlic bread & calamari for an appetizer which was nothing short of extraordinary!! For the main course I had the Mama's gravy which came with pasta on one dish and pork,chicken,& beef on the other plate. It was a combination of a lot of food and great taste all wrapped in one. I highly recommend this place while in the area. Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I expected a lot more because of the name behind it. I Have to admit I was pretty excited to try this place out and not that I was disappointed but more so I wasn't wowed or left with a \"can't wait to come back\" feeling. A couple friends were in town and like any vegas visitor wanted to try something new. We came for Sunday brunch and instead of ordering off the regular menu they offer a Sunday brunch buffet. Though the selection was more than enough to fill me up, don't expect a lot of food (the idea most might get when thinking of a vegas buffet).  The food was ok. Nothing spectacular but very well presented. First time ever seeing dragonfruit and lychees (served in original shell and \"hair\") in a restaurant so that was new for me. Disappointment #1 for the price you are kind of better off checking out one of the other casino buffets.

The restaurant itself was cute, family like and had a really open feeling. Love the concept of the open kitchen! 

As for service, this would be disappointment #2. Our server sold us the idea of unlimited drinks for an upgrade (of course) but the fact we only saw him 2 times our entire visit, limited the drinks we could order. We had to ask our busser on 3 different occasions for more water. Plus side though the bloody mary bar was pretty neat, lots of hot sauce options, vegetables and additions to choose from...good touch! We could tell they were a bit short handed since we only saw 3 servers (from what we could tell) covering the entire floor and they were fairly busy.  So we cut him some slack because he was very nice. 

Hostess staff was a little rude and not very personable but our interaction with them was short enough to make it tolerable. 

We wanted to visit the bakery but the line was so long we decided against it. I'm a local so not sure I would visit again unless visitors from out of town really want to go, but even then I might suggest another spot."}
{"text":"Yum!!! It's insane how many restaurants there are in Vegas but my friends and I decided on this one because the menu looked good and it was in our hotel. The service was really good. Our waiter took the time to suggest us some appetizers and gave us his opinions on his favorite entrees and pastas. For appetizers, we got the fried calamari and a margherita pizza. The pizza was good and the calamari was really great. The calamari also had fried green peppers which was a little strange and I would have preferred those peppers to just have been more calamari but whatever. It also had really thin lemon slices that were somehow cooked to the point that they were crunchy and they tasted so good with the calamari.

For my meal I decided on the chicken and rigatoni a la vodka because I love pasta with vodka sauce and I don't have the chance to get it a lot. It did not disappoint at all. I loved the pieces of pancetta in it and the pasta was cooked perfectly. Sure it wasn't the healthiest dish (I definitely felt like I needed some vegetables after my meal) but it was delicious so I have no regrets. A couple of my friends got the sea bass and both loved it. Others got the chicken parm and carbonara and everyone enjoyed their dishes.

On to price, is it worth the price? Yes, the food was good, but $24 still is a lot for a pasta dish with sauce and chicken. If it wasn't on the Strip, I would say the prices were ridiculous. However, I think this is one of the more reasonably priced restaurants considering some of the other restaurants nearby. Its good for groups of friends or for families, and I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Grand Openings are not always grand.  I get it.  Staff is nervous.  Owners are stressed, etc.  Today was the opening of Buddy V's in the Venetian.  My fellow event planners and I wanted to escape the 3200 person conference we were working on and go somewhere without strobe lights and bass, so we came here.

I will start with the good:  
The decor here is great.  It takes up a corner spot on the Canal Shoppes level and you have a view of TI, the Trump and the strip.  It's rustic and familiar.  Red checkered napkins and rustic wood tables with interesting lighting fixtures.  My favorite was the children's artwork on the walls and the family photos everywhere (especially the dessert menu).

The food was GREAT.  I had the Orechiette with Italian Sausage.  It was flavorful and satisfying.  It had a perfect balance of al dente pasta, savory sausage and broccoli and tomatoes.  I wasn't starving, but I ate ALL of it. My team had the spaghetti and meatballs, the Burratta Salad and the meatballs.  They ALL raved without exception.  If it only depended on food and decor, i would have been more generous with my rating.   However, for me, service trumps it ALL. 

The not so good:
Service was odd.  We arrived for our noon reservation and the restaurant was probably 1/4 full.  There were PLENTY of open booths that would have accommodated us perfectly, but the hostess decided on putting us at a table in the back.  Once seated we waited a bit to be greeted by our server, but he eventually showed and took our order.  Once orders arrived, we all seemed to receive what belonged to someone else.  Then we had an unfortunate situation that involved our waiter spilling ice cold lemonade all over someone in our party.  It was a mistake and I felt terrible for him.  But the problem was he didn't seem prepared for the situation.  He remedied it as best he could by getting help, some towels and eventually a staff tshirt for our young group member (which lucky for him was not someone in an expensive business suit).  At the end of our lunch he announced his apologies and included that his manager was so sorry about the situation that he would be sending over a dessert for the table.  Now I don't know about you, but once I was at BJ's restaurant and there was a spill at our table that hit a few of our shoes and the manager raced over, paid for our dinner AND offered to pay for our shoes and dry cleaning!  and that was at a chain pizza place!  I'm going to take a wild guess and say that if someone spilled ice cold anything all over one of Buddy V's kids, he wouldn't be so keen on getting a hard puff pastry filled with custard as an apology.  While the spill was the waiter's mistake, management could have comped her lunch or at least her drink -- which he still charged us for!   

Unfortuantely, this is what I will remember most about my time at Buddy V's."}
{"text":"After speaking with the GM & Owner, learning of their concern for our health and desire to retain us as customers, really showed great customer service us. We appreciate their effort to provide support anyway they could. #GottaLoveGoodCustomerService"}
{"text":"My family and i went for brunch. The services and drinks were great, but the brunch menu was limited. There wasn't much of a variety."}
{"text":"Where to start...

Location is awkward (end of a mostly deserted hallway) and was certainly of no help to former occupant FIRST Food and Bar.

Ambiance inside the restaurant itself is quite nice, although tables thrown in the hallway seem strange.  Outdoor seating is laughable and ill-conceived.  It's essentially at the top of an escalator leading up from Walgreens/down to the Strip so plenty of foot traffic will get to check-out your food.  The outdoor view is obstructed by a wall.  This area was never intended for restaurant seating and has emerged as a hot spot for Grand Canal Shoppes' employees to congregate and smoke.  Enjoy!

Service is slow and uninterested, perhaps even worse than FIRST.  Maybe the same staff?  A friend of mine said he and his date waited 15 minutes at an empty bar to be acknowledged, let alone served.  He was so aggravated they left without eating.  He's a bartender in the Venetian and understands the importance of timely service.  My experience wasn't much better.

My food was bland, we're talking CPK bland.  A penne dish was swimming in flavorless oil and assorted vegetables that looked to be left-over from some other dish and the chicken parm was just as bland.  Skipped dessert which was probably my mistake given that's the namesake's claim to fame.  Speaking of, who thought naming an Italian restaurant after a well-known PASTRY chef was a good idea?

I've already spent too much energy on this place.  Maybe it will improve and it seems others have had better experiences, but I won't give it a second go."}
{"text":"I've been in Vegas 4 days and have eaten here 3 times and will be back for lunch tomorrow. My husband doesn't like Italian food, so I don't get my fill, but this place changed that. Twice I've been here alone and the service and food has just been fantastic.  I've gotten the pizza, lasagna, tomato basil soup and caesar salad and liked the salad least of all. Both desserts - the cheesecake and creme brulee- were fantastic.  I wish we had one of these in Austin!!!!"}
{"text":"Kickass Italian food. This is one of the best Italian meals I've ever had. I have my favorite places in Chicago and San Francisco's Little Italy, but Buddy V's is every bit as good as they are.
The grilled octopus was one of the most delicious dishes I've ever had in my mouth. My entree was the \"Sunday Gravy\" and I can't imagine ordering anything else. It was Fan-freakin-tastic!
Service is top notch.
Go. Here. Now!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch with the Wife. We shared the smashed meatball sandwich. I started with a caesar salad and I do not know what they do to those croutons, but damn they are good. Head up on the salad, they are heavy with the anchovies. I did not mind it and almost licked my salad plate clean. 

Then the meatball sub came out. The meatballs were awesome, the bread nice and crunchy, and the right amount of cheese(more mozzarella than ricotta). 

We both enjoyed the meal and left full. 

The waiter seemed like he was in pain, the way he was moving around, almost like he through he back out of something. So maybe that was why we did not seem to be in that great of a mood. 

All and all a great meal and will try it again on another trip."}
{"text":"The food was great, must try the garlic bread, calamari and can't skip out on dessert, the cannoli is absolutely delicious. Service was a little slow but they were great which made up for it. They have a $22 lunch special which offers an appetizer, main entree and dessert."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here for a bachelorette dinner. The host was nice enough to see if we can have our happy hour bites at our dinner table and luckily we were able to. The one thing that dampened everyone's meal was the server. She was haste and not very amicable. I feel like I saw her at most 3 times during our entire meal. 

Nonetheless, the meal itself was pretty delicious. We order a variety of the happy hour bites such as the meatballs, sliders and Mac and cheese to share. I ordered the chicken and pasta which I actually felt like it was large enough to share. I would also recommend taking advantage of the happy hour drinks to go along with your meal. Overall experience was a little more than average but definitely could have been better. Hoping to make another visit to give this place another try."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Loved everything! The Sunday Gravy is the best....Service Amazing and our Hostess Marissa was beautiful and classy!"}
{"text":"This was probably some of the best authentic Italian I've ever had. The Chicken Rigatoni Ala Vodka pasta was phenomenal. I've been dreaming about it since I left Vegas! It's going to be a place we definitely visit again next time we come back! I love the fresh baked bread we got once we ordered and the Moscato de asi we ordered with ate dinner was also wonderful. Love this place! We had great service and a wonderful environment."}
{"text":"I got spaghetti with meatballs, and my friend got Lisa V pasta. Dayummmm portions are small but after finishing my dish, I'm perfectly full. Flavor is just right, noodles are not soft but a bit chewy. I can seriously eat another one in a few minutes. It's that good!! My hot server was on top of her game, checking on us every 5-8 minutes to make sure we're okay. Food and service was perfect!"}
{"text":"I normally don't order spaghetti and meatballs, but it was included in the Prix Fix meal, and I wanted a salad.  So,  I reluctantly ordered it.   Man oh man, am I ever glad  I did.  It was just like my aunts, if not better.  The most succulent meatballs ever!! The sauce was so good too.  I almost ate the whole bowl.  I left  a few bites because I was so stuffed.  I thought about it he next day, that's how I know it was good!!!"}
{"text":"The food and staff here are fantastic! Some of the best Italian my wife and I have ever ate!"}
{"text":"Always great to come back here. Cheese board is always great. Very fun atmosphere and servers are always great. I recommend coming here for the authentic Italian."}
{"text":"2nd visit to Vegas and again we go to Buddy V's and have an awesome meal and reasonably priced for Vegas. The cannolis are the best ever. This is a definite keeper on our next visit."}
{"text":"Casual family friendly restaurant in the Venetian. My husband is a huge fan of Cake Boss, so we had to stop here and Carlos's bakery when in town.

No reservations were needed for lunch and there are many tables. Casual Italian fare of sandwiches, pastas, and some meat dishes. We shared the eggplant starter and each had one of the sandwiches for lunch. The eggplant was okay - presentation was on the sloppy side though. My BLT was nicely presented with grill marks on the bread. Service seemed a bit forced and over cheerful. Food was a little slow to arrive given that it wasn't particularly busy when we arrived.

Overall a-ok but there are much better spots in town for mid-range pricing. The main plus is that it's family friendly if you have kids in tow."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian I've had!! Got the lasagna and chicken parm, unbelievable!! Was worried, Italian can be done REALLY wrong, this is old school basic Italian perfected! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Everything was delicious. The busser was awesome and made sure the drinks were never empty. He is definitely a hard worker and I appreciated it. The waiter was great also. Affordable prices with decent portions. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Service:  Wonderful.  For the first week of a new operation, the waitstaff was friendly, helpful and efficient.  The servers had issues figuring our who ordered what, but this was probably because we were four sitting at a booth that could seat six.  Extremely accommodating.

Decor: Great views of the strip from the window booth. Nicely laid out with not too many tables and not too close together.  However, the cold air was blowing on us the entire time and I didn't go to Vegas for the cold weather.  Please fix this.

Food: Turkey meatballs were wonderful.  Chicken Parm was chewy and probably overcooked.  We came for the desserts and were disappointed that there isn't a more traditional cake.  I realize you have to spice things up, but if you are going to have funky desserts, you should also have at least one boring chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Was expecting more from this dining experience. Had a charcuterie plate and they went with boring, everyday cheeses. Poor garnishments. Not what you'd expect for $19. My son had the Hoboken Cheesesteak and the meat was excessively greasy. He couldn't finish it without fear of gastrointestinal issues. I had the spaghetti with meatballs. It was good. Not great. Certainly not what I expected from a celebrity chef."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful customer service by the manager here. He treated me very poorly when I spoke with him about our server (who was wonderful). He accused me of taking a bribe from the server to give him a compliment. I'm highly disappointed."}
{"text":"We were excited to see that Buddy Valastro had a restaurant in Las Vegas & had to try it out. Definitely were not disappointed! 

Both of our servers were excellent. Went with the recommendation for the Caesar salad as it included polenta croutons that were out of this world good! Salad was crisp, bright & fresh. Hubby greatly enjoyed the mac & cheese, while my eggplant parm was fantastic! Will definitely come back on our next trip West!"}
{"text":"Place is actually better than I expected.  Classic Italian food with huge portions and prices. Carbonara like spaghetti was awesome.

Squid was excellent also.  Desert here was good. Had some kind of chocolate hazel nut cake with coffee ice cream. So creamy and fulfillling.

Then We Walk Over To Carlos bakery.  :)"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for this gem without much background info on it. We were immediately greeted and welcomed into a cutely decorated restaurant. 

I had the chicken parm, husband had the cheeseburger and soup, we also got the cheesy garlic bread. My husband enjoyed his burger but was very disappointed because he didn't get he chicken parm. This is the best chicken parm I've ever had.... chicken was so moist and juicy. It melted in my mouth and left me wanting to finish off this large potion. Thankfully, my husband ended up eating some of mine and saved me from devouring the caloric bomb. Everything we had was tasty and we will definitely be returning. 

I encourage you to stop in here and give this place a try. It's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant I love the Children Parmesan it is a very good choice. The atmosphere is also very nice. My family and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Our first trip to Vegas and we selected this as our finale meal. We had good food at a variety of places in Vegas, but this was certainly the best. As a table of four (or more) we had the family style option, a fixed price, multi course meal. It was spectacular. Our server, Georgio, was the perfect combination of attentive and conversational, while knowing when to allow us time to chat and digest between courses. Family style dishes are determined by the chef. First course was panzanella (Italian bread salad), fried calamari (accented with thin sliced fried lemon!), grandma's meatballs, and a charcuterie board. Each item was prepared perfectly. We had a very nice Chardonnay with this course. If the meal had ended there we all would have been wonderfully satisfied with our meal. After letting that settle a bit, out came the entrees: a perfectly cooked beef tenderloin on a bed of mashed potatoes, a gargantuan portion of lasagna, tender chicken medallions in Marsala sauce, and a beautifully prepared sea bass. With the entrees we had Pinot noir. There was no room in our bodies for another morsel of food, but we cheered each other on to eat a bit of each of the desserts: a miniature Italian wedding cake (in honor of our brother and sister in law that were celebrating their 25th anniversary), chocolate cake with coffe gelato, and a conical, cream filled pastry called a lobster tail. 
A meal of a lifetime, with impeccable service. If your budget allows, definitely make Buddy Vs a priority stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"The staff is very good at up selling a rather mediocre menu at best. The restaurant counts on the fame of Buddy and really not geared to a true foodie."}
{"text":"I was a little worried about dining at Buddy's since he's know for his pastries, but my experience was superb.

My friends treated me to Buddy V's for my birthday. We went in on a Sunday around 5pm with no wait. 
We ordered from the prix fixe menu which I believe was $39 for three courses, and we also order the highly recommended lasagna. We ordered meatballs and Caesar salad our starters, chicken parm for our main and ended with Lisa's Nutella cake for dessert. We were also given complementary bread.

In one word, go! Everything was unbelievably amazing. Even the croutons on the salad, which are made to order with a crunchy exterior and warm, soft interior. I always seem to go to Italian restaurants for my birthday, and this is by far the best that I've been to. It's a little pricey, but so worth it."}
{"text":"Real NY/NJ Italian. Chicken Parm was one of the best I've ever had. Panzanella was good, a little overdressed and hence soggy. Caprese good but wished there was more tomato. Focaccia (complimentary) was amazing. Margarita pizza was small and just ok. Tiramisu was small and pretty good. Service quick and on point."}
{"text":"This was the best food we had in Las Vegas the whole 8 days we were there!  My husband got the lasagna and I got the spaghetti with marinara sauce.  It was all awesome and we ate it all.  Sweet tea was great!  Serving staff left a carafe of it at the table for us.  We will definitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Delicious and promising authentic Italian food.  Expensive though.   Make this a one trip dining during your stay in Vegas.  Food reminds you of Grandmas."}
{"text":"We stopped by Buddy's this week to get cannoll's to go.  We were told to go to the bar.  After being ignored for at least ten minutes the rude female bartender finally got our order.  She does not need to work in the service industry!  The cannoli made up for it though!  Excellent.  Went back the next day for more.  Again Buddy would be appalled at how rude the waitstaff in his bar area is - even if you are busy you tell someone you will be with them in a minute.  But once again the cannoli was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Can't for the life in me figure out how this place has eeked out 4 stars. I give it 1. 

Ate here for lunch. Very limited menu at lunch. We ordered the carbonara bucatini for $23 a plate. Next to no sauce and only a few chunks of pancetta. Had to flag down the waiter and order more sauce. \"Garlic\" bread appetizer came as 3 slices of dried out cheese bread with I swear not an ounce of garlic taste to it. The next table to us ordered garlic bread also and got 4 slices; not that I WANTED more but really.....


Place looks nice and clean however."}
{"text":"our waiter was fine.  very polite and attentive.  that was the best part of the meal!!!  
that's sad!

so disappointed in the food here!  absolutely horrible lasagna.  might be the worst i've ever had (maybe chef boyardee is worse - MAYBE!!!)

do not go here to eat.  so many better places in LV!  

absolutely bland and boring food.  calamari was just meh.  the meatballs were ok but kind of bland.

DO NOT EAT HERE! cannot stress that enough.  unless you want to overpay for bad food. 

VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. They really made sure my  anaphylaxis child was safe and able to eat his meal. I'm so thankful. Service and atmosphere were amazing. Having my son eat and feel safe beats the taste of the food.  As for the food, well it was eh, ok. Nothing to write home about but service was great!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and even better food.  Went there with a large wedding party.  If you like Italian, and even if you don't, this is the best restaurant in town."}
{"text":"The dessert was delicious! My chicken rigatoni was raw. The chicken was chewy so I cut all the pieces and sure enough it was pink! Super disappointed. The pasta wasn't bad at all...a little salty for my taste. The chicken Piccata was cooked nicely. The cannoli was very good. The cheesecake was amazing!!! The manager took care of us...free dessert. We will go back for dessert and a no-chicken dish :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here earlier this year and I can say the service is truly amazing. We dined on a late Sunday evening and our waiter was very attentive throughout the time. 

Food: I wasn't super impressed with the food based on all the reviews. No complaints, just didn't live up to the hype I saw in the other reviews. We had the fried mozzarella, lasagna, and garlic bread (huge portions). I felt like Maggianos has tastier sauces for everything we tried, and similar pricing. Would I come here again?? Sure, why not as service was great!"}
{"text":"From appetizer to desert Buddy V's was a great Italian dinner. The mozzarella en carrozza was delightful, the scallops were seared to perfection and served on the creamiest polenta I've ever had. My wife enjoyed her ravioli and my kids had the pizzas. All delicious. 

Desert: we had the lobster tail and Nutella cake. Both were decadent. The lobster tail was smaller than I had anticipated; but it was flaky and the cream filling wasn't heavy."}
{"text":"Well, i just have to say that this is the best italian restaurant I have been in , service, food and place was just amazing!
Eggplant parmigana 10/10
Lasgna 9/10
Chicken parmigana 1000
Pasta a la vodka 1000000
Tiramisu blow minded"}
{"text":"Looking back at this experience, I'm actually angry. Maybe it deserves a 2, but this is the worst experience I've had on strip, I expected much better. I feel used, dirty. We had a party of 8, 4 couples. I brought 2 bottles of wine (tempranillo and a cab/syrah) intending to pay the corkage fee, which turned out to be $35 (highest I've ever encountered). The waiter said that since we were Seahawks fans and he was too (night before the super bowl) he would waive one of the fees if we tipped him more, more or less, even though he'd rather see us enjoy an Italian wine with dinner.  After examining the wine list we opted for the ones I brought. The waiter also informed us that since we were a big party we should take advantage of an \"appetizer platter\" for us all to share, meats, cheeses and salad, sold to us as a family style Italian sharing experience. We talked it over and all agreed it sounded good. Then we ordered our entrees, 1 couple opted to split the ravioli, my boyfriend ordered the lasagna and I planned on ordering the small margherita pizza so we could share. When I tried to order my margherita the waiter told me it was really small, just an appetizer, I told him I wanted small because I wasn't terribly hungry and didn't want leftovers, he insisted I should get the chicken alla vodka because they had just won an award for it, I asked if it was small, he said \"oh yes, very small\" and gestured with his hands. I caved, and ordered it, after all, I do love pasta and vodka sauce.  Appetizers came shortly after, 2 different salads, 2 meat/cheese/bread platters, calamari, and the meatballs (6). It was all ok, nothing spectacular, but one of the salads was pretty good (it had arugula, yum), and the meatballs were pretty good (nothing compared to Casa di Amore's off-strip though). The entrees came and my pasta was huge (bigger than he implied at least, average dish size for most restaurants though). My noodles were undercooked and the chicken was incredibly dry, sauce was decent, but not enough to make the chicken palatable.  I gave away most of my dish to the couple who split the ravioli, as they were pretty underwhelmed with theirs too, and thought mine was a slight improvement. I took one ravioli in exchange and nibbled my boyfriend's lasagna which was actually pretty amazing (in comparison), meanwhile kicking myself that I didn't just stick with the pizza.  The check came, north of $400, turns out the appetizers were all billed separately, so we should have just ordered what we wanted to begin with.  Looking back I'm convinced that the waiter only wanted me to have the more expensive entree, not the one I'd be happy with, and it angers me that he wouldn't just take my order as I intended. I suppose I've learned my lesson, stay away from gimmicky strip restaurants, stick to your guns, and recognize the upselling. What a swindle, this waiter put used car salesmen to shame, I've never felt more used after a dining experience, and the food was mediocre at best. I'm pretty sure he wasn't really a Seahawks fan either. Buyer beware. We'll stick with Casa in the future."}
{"text":"I was actually stupid-impressed by this place. I didn't have much in terms of expectations, but things went incredibly well here from the food perspective. Our waiter was also incredibly cool, and we definitely enjoyed the overall experience. The food was American-Italian as all get out, and among some of the best for that style you can expect to get. 

However; the things that drop the rating down are more about the overall experience. The starters were okay (meatballs), and the whole place/atmosphere overall was a bit iffy. The chairs are your standard fare for restaurants like this, and seemed really flimsy and were uncomfortable. The drink list felt a little lacking, and I feel like the suggested drinks were more a marketing speech more than a genuine recommendation. 

Negatives aside; dat veal parm was just fantastic. Hardly can think of another that I like more, it definitely stands there near the top of some of the best I've had of that particular dish. Want more...."}
{"text":"Food and service were on point. Servers worked as a team. Someone was checking in every 10-15 minutes, to make sure I was ok.

I had the tomato soup which was very rich and a nice start, their lasagna was filling but could not stop me from their Nutella dessert and salted caramel ice cream. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness we had the best salad (Buddy's Caprese) to start and were smart enough to share the salad and meatball sandwich.  The salad had the most unbelievable croutons in it.  I almost filled up on those alone.  Oh and the cheese in it... stop it.  So delicious.  We then shared the meatball sandwich and fries.  The sandwich is a bit messy just as any good Italian should be.  I thought the meatballs were very good and authentic.  I am surprised by the low reviews from various people because my experience could not have been better.  I also went to the bakery across the way and bought a cookie and brownie and both tasted homemade.  I really dislike \"bakery\" tasting cookies and to my surprise these were as if I had baked them in my own kitchen.  I'd highly suggest this place.  Also, I noticed a great room for big parties which I might use when in town again on business down the road.  The bar has a cool ambiance although I was there during the day on a Monday so it wasn't crowded.  I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Special thanks to Bethany our fantastic waitress for recommending the Beef Tenderloin with sauteed spinach, mashed potatoes, chianti sauce! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try based on the yelp reviews they received, and boy were they spot on. It had a great atmosphere and a friendly staff. 

Our server (Peter maybe?) was super helpful with great suggestions. When we couldn't decide on a dish he assisted us in building another dish to combined the best of both worlds. When we were unsure of wine, he made a suggestion based on our dish. 

The food was great, the wine was delicious, and we had an overall great experience. We were very please with the customer service and recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"A little hard to find if you're in the casino but a great place to eat. Service was good but not polished. The meatballs were perfect. Very flavorful. Sea scallops were delicious. Ambience is nice but it's more bustling than relaxing. Italian birthday cake is something I'd highly recommend if you're in the mood for dessert. Skip the drinks, they looked overpriced and sugary."}
{"text":"The appetizers were good but the sea bass was a disappointment as it was dry and over cooked. At the $29 price I would expect more. The manager did not seem to care about our complaint and was rude.  There are by far better places to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Told us we had to wait 45 mins for a table for 3 people, when the 45 mins was up they offered us a table in a hallway outside the restaurant and never mentioned that's where the table would be. When we asked how long the wait would be for a table inside the restaurant we were told it would be a 30 Mom wait due to \"private events\"."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to see if Buddy V's cooking lived up to its hype, so instead of taking a trip to Jersey, we decided to stop in to his Vegas location. We went on a Sunday morning (the morning of the Route 91) massacre.  

We ordered the brunch buffet (about $35 per person, all you can eat, including pastries), which gave us a large variety of meats, salads, veggies, appetizers, pastas, soups, and of course, pastries. I can't say that this was the best Italian food I've ever had, nor can I say the pastries were phenomenal, but everything was authentic and tasted good. The meatballs definitely lived up to the hyped up reviews. I even enjoyed the \"peel your own\" shrimp. 

Price was decent, considering it was owned by the world famous Buddy V. There was also a live band that played in the bar area, creating a really nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not bad for on the Strip, but far from the best Italian you can get within the Strip, let alone the Venetian/Palazzo - where Buddy V's can be found.  

It's in a great spot on the Strip with some killer views of Las Vegas Blvd.  At night though prepare to be blinded by video screens that are within close proximity of the restaurant.  As far as food goes...We went fairly straightforward with our dining choices. 

Grilled Garlic Bread - We did this because you are not served complimentary bread,  
Bucatini Carbonara - Probably the best thing we had to eat out of our 3 dishes.  Pretty good flavor and the pasta was al dente.  
Chicken Marsala - This was just very meh.  Not much flavor going on, but at least they give you a decent sized portion.  

Buddy V's fits a 3 star rating perfectly.  It's not the cheapest place, but it's also not the most expensive.  It's not the best, but it's not the worst.  As long as you know this going in, you will have a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"I went to Buddy V's with some out of town guests who love Italian.  The location is good, the ambiance nice, the service was decent. The food was just OK; Not great by any means. Maybe I had high expectations, but I was seriously disappointed and so were my guests. I had the carbonara, it was super salty. My husband had the clams. He was not impressed.  The ceasar salad was excellent. For the price, not a great value."}
{"text":"Great service, good food.  Definitely worth a try.
Fave: chicken Parm with Spaghetti 
Least Fave: Margherita Pizza"}
{"text":"Was there with family last night, the food was even better than the 1st time we were there.  I booked a reservation on open table & requested a view for my visiting cousins; they gave us a beautiful booth with an amazing view of the Spring Mtn corner.
I can't speak highly enough of the server & buser...so on the ball that we never had to ask for ANYTHING! 
My cousins LOVED the experience; not just the food...it was a great night:)"}
{"text":"Dinner last night with 3 very close clients. Overall very good, excellent spin on Italian with references to Buddy V's heritage. We shared a variety of appetizers, the signature dried meats and cheese board was excellent. For entree's a couple of us opted for pasta, cooked perfectly, flavorful. We also shared a couple of desserts of which the Canoli was very creative and extraordinary. The Canoli is kind of deconstructed which makes it fun to eat. Overall highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Overall a great experience and wonderful food! We were early for our reservation, so we started with drinks in the bar. Sangria was good, it's a blend of white and red wine which was different. Only complaint was service was slow.

When we moved into the restaurant area, our experience just got better from there. Service was fabulous! All of the wait staff were very attentive. We ordered grandma's meatballs, lasagna and the chicken parm. The meatballs were absolutely delicious! Best restaurant meatballs I've ever had. My husband raved about the lasagna and talked about it the rest of the night. We would definitely go back just to have that. Chicken parm was good, but not the best in LV. The sauce on all the food had great flavor and consistency. Being Italian and growing up in NY, this restaurant exceeded my expectations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Normal, fama devido ao programa de tv. A sobremesa foi o melhor. Pratos individuais mas bem servidos"}
{"text":"Excellent service. We were seated quickly not know that the were closing. All staff members were accommodating and friendly. A member of our party had a gluten allergy and the staff went out of their way to make sure she found something on the menu despite all the Italian carb/wheat options. They do apparently have a gluten free penne pasta option. The food came out quickly and was delicious! I would recommend and come back. Oh... And prices very reasonable. #winning"}
{"text":"The RJ did a review on this restaurant and I had no desire to visit until I read it.

We came for a late dinner on a Monday night. I didn't think we would need reservations. Walking down the hall, we were met with a huge line and I hoped it wasn't a dinner rush. I suddenly second guessed my decision to gamble on a walk in. We got closer and realized the crowd was for the bake shop located directly across the hall from the restaurant. Still, there was a good amount of people in front of the host stand. Turns out, Buddy and some of the guys were there! He was near the bar that was sectioned off for a private party, but it was still pretty cool to see them there none the less!

We were seated right away and really liked the decor and vibe of the place. Caleb was our server and he pretty much made our night. He offered bottled, sparkling, or tap water to start while we looked over the menu.

We started with Aunt Nina's Mozzarella en Carrozza as suggested by the RJ review and also by Caleb. Be sure to order this when you come! Think fried mozzarella, but done the way it should be. The outside provided a perfect crunch and the inside had all the ooey-gooey-ness you hope to find when you get fried mozzarella. It comes dressed with a tomato sauce and pesto sauce drizzle. After our first bite, we immediately contemplated ordering another. We held off as we planned on saving room for dessert.

My fiancée ordered one of the specialty cocktails as well. I don't remember which one..it had good flavor, but the alcohol was a little strong for her liking. Caleb was attentive enough to notice she wasn't drinking it and asked a couple times if she would like him to get her something else. Being in the service industry herself and not wanting to create more hassle, she declined and figured she would drink it with her entree. Caleb came over once more and took the glass and said he wanted to get her a glass of his favorite drink on the menu. He brought back a cocktail the was tequila based and had a sprig of rosemary. My fiancée doesn't care for tequila but I enjoyed the drink very much. We were very appreciative of Caleb's initiative to make our experience the best it could be.

My fiancée was torn between the chicken parm and the chicken rigatoni \"alla vodka\". Based on the descriptions and recommendations of our server, she went with the latter. I ordered the Agnolotti. The rigatoni was perfectly al dente and the sauce was very well prepared. The Agnolotti was so hearty from the flavorful meat filling and the brown butter sauce was a perfect compliment. 

We somehow managed to save some room for dessert. My fiancée has a weakness for cannolis so her decision was made fairly quickly. I came in with the intention of ordering the XL lobster tail pastry. After the meal I just had, the \"XL\" part turned me off of that idea. I was torn between the birthday cake and the Nutella cake. I turned once more to Caleb for advice trusting he would once again deliver and not turn us astray. I ended up with the Nutella cake.

The cannoli was very flavorful and had a nice touch of cinnamon. It was served with a side of chocolate sauce. The Nutella cake was actually a lava cake. It was very moist which is often lost on such a dessert. It was served with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream which perfectly balanced the sweetness of the cake.

All in all it was a great experience. The dinner menu is a little bit smaller compared to other Italian restaurants, but if every item is executed well, who cares?? Be sure to ask for Caleb and be sure to order Aunt Nina's mozzarella. I am convinced that everything on the menu is delicious and we will definitely be returning to test that theory."}
{"text":"First off, the food is not bad here, not great but would give it B+.

The problem is the noise level; it is horrific.  We sat in banquets by the kitchen and heard every order 3 times and every pan bang.  As if this is not enough noise, they play cheesy music soooo loud."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and excellent service! We were seated right away at our reservation time and had a great visit. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and service was great. I most enjoyed Mama's Meatballs but not the polenta croutons that came with the caeser salad. Do not get the polenta croutons unless you like polenta."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED everything here! We asked for a table by the window and had a nice view. The drinks are all really great. Highly recommend the chicken parm. We ended the night with a cannoli which was PERFECT!!"}
{"text":"thankfully it was right where we entered the hotel (from the pedestrian walkway/bridge), so we didn't have to walk far into the venetian lol... there's a lil tables w/ chairs and umbrellas section by the windows near the entrance of the pedestrian walkway/bridge (it's right by huge open windows, no screens so birds literally flew in and ate crumbs off the tables!! idk if u like birds w/ ur meals but i sure wouldn't.. idk y they don't have screens on the windows! but yeah this is their version of an outdoor patio i guess) and also  there's even more extra seating outside the restaurant if u wanna be in the venetian hotel corridor and do people watching (but this section was roped off when we were there). anyway so we find out we didn't have to wait either :))) we got a nice table by the window so we got a nice view of the strip. our waiter was very nice and informative all around. the bread provided was errr different lol but VERY soft which i appreciated, but def do NOT use the oil concoction provided, OMGOSH it has a horrible taste!!! it only lasts a couple secs but man i was tempted to spit it out lol and my husband actually did.. i dunno, maybe the waiter did the concoction wrong? anyone else get bad flavor w/ it?? i really don't see the appeal of that stuff *shrugs.. anyway, i ordered the 'valastro sunday gravy' which is rigatoni pasta w/ various meats: meatballs, sausage, pork, and lamb.. everything was really soft and tender! however, the meatballs didn't taste like i like em (oh well) and the pasta sauce looked a bit orange rather than red, i don't wanna be insulting but my husband did say 'chef boyardee' when he tried my rigatoni lol.. it was still good tho and great portions. also, the server who brought it actually took the meats out of the lil pot they come in and placed em on my plate of rigatoni for me, i thought that was a nice touch :)...
  
i also got 2 desserts which the waiter suggested i do cuz i asked him if it was better to get desserts in the restaurant or across in the bakery (price-wise, etc). he suggested the restaurant for the lisa's warm nutella cake (i love nutella so this was a must and tasted very good when i had it later that nite). the lil cake has a filling of peanut butter (if i remember right) in the middle, it was thick lol, i wish i had eaten it when i was in the restaurant still... also, it comes w/ salted caramel ice cream which i wasn't a fan of the taste.. i like my ice cream sweet lol, not salty so that was an adjustment for my taste buds but i ate most of it nonetheless.. the crunchy bits that came w/ it were tasty tho IMO... and of course i had to get the tiramisu (i LOVE tiramisu so i was having high expectations w/ this!) it came in this lil jar deal w/ a few lady finger cookies on the side. i was pretty satisfied w/ the tiramisu but i do wish it was more traditionally plated (a square freely on the plate.. idk what it is about vegas strip restaurants putting desserts in jars lol). a nice lil touch is, they give u an italiany postcard saying thank u on it w/ the check which i appreciated and brought home as a souvenir! :) overall, the food wasn't to die for IMO, w/ buddy's shows and cooking/baking being his forte, u'd think his restaurant would be amazing food-wise, but idk maybe the chefs were having an off day or it should've been cooked by buddy himself lol... either way, i still adore the guy and will continue to watch his TLC shows happily as i have been since day 1!"}
{"text":"The brunch was so much fun and delicious!! Come hungry! A little expensive but I didn't regret it."}
{"text":"Good food and good service! Pretty traditional Italian fare. The layout is a little wonky. But the focaccia bread was so good !!! A wonderful dinner out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I, are locals, celebrated our anniversary there tonight and it was fantastic. It's a little piece of the Italian family we have back east, complete with Sunday Gravy---highly recommended!! Also they make their own mozzarella & ricotta (you'll want to make a meal out of those alone)."}
{"text":"This restaurant was okay. There weren't a ton of people and it took FOREVER to get served. Also,there is no bathroom in the restaurant so you have to schlep out into the hotel which is a pain. 
The food was fine, not really memorable. The decor was odd, it was like old home comfort mixed with a modern feel? Either go old home comfort to match your food or go modern? The server was nice and personable."}
{"text":"Pretty decent little restaurant and we will be back. That being said I think this place is entirely overhyped due to its celebrity association. We came here at a weird time and only had a choice of like 5 real food items. A bit oddd. I am sure my review will be better if I eat during a different time."}
{"text":"We went to eat at Buddy V's Ristorante, not knowing what to expect, neither my husband or I really follow his show. However, we were starving and figured since it was newer to Vegas it was worth a try...

Absolutely delicious!!!! Everything we ordered was really good. The brick oven pizza was the best I ever had! We could tell that only the freshest and best ingredients were used. 

I liked the interior as well, it was modern looking but felt also had an old world Italian feel to it!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  Great service, great food, great atmosphere!  A must try whenever you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went to buddy v's on another recommendation from my fellow yelpers. Good solid food. Great service. 

My sister got the lasagna and said yes it tasted like home and I got the chicken parm which was also delicious. Both were good and I think next time I'm in Vegas I will stop in.

The prices were pretty reasonable as well as we both got wine and I think our bill was only about $80."}
{"text":"Was extremely looking forward trying the Buddy V's, however, the food was extremely salty.
I tried the fried calamari and was very awful and salty, the garlic bread was the best among all of my orders.

Waiters were friendly and professional but still we came for the food and it was not good."}
{"text":"Being the owner is a cake boss and I'm from Delaware only 1 hr from the original location. I was spectacle about coming here for good Italian food but we were in Vegas and hungry so we gave it a shoot. First we didn't have a reservation but they sat us in only 15 min wait time. So while at the bar I seen they have a signature The Cake Boss Martini and let me tell you it was best martini I have had in a long time! The garlic bread was awesome, portions are huge and the desert is wonderful. We even talked to the manager Stewart and expressed what a great place this was to visit!"}
{"text":"We were very surprised the food was very tasty.
The portions are big enough to share, we ordered the 3 course menu and one appetizer extra, this was more at enough.
Very nice waiters, good service. 
We will come back!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food!!  The caprese salad was fresh, light and the burrata cheese was delicious.   The meatball sub had a great creamy cheese on it."}
{"text":"Had the $22 three-course prix fixe, \"express lunch.\" Started with the panzanella, and it was amazing. This place probably has the best croutons in the world. Next time I go, I might just ask for a side of croutons with my salad because WOW. Because I split our main courses with someone else, I got to try both the Bucatini Carbonara and the Spaghetti Bolognese. I personally preferred the Carbonara, because I thought the sauce had struck the perfect balance and the noodles were great, but the other person slightly preferred the Bolognese. Moral of the story: both were excellent. We finished with cannoli and tiramisu. Both were, as you could have guessed, fantastic. Moreover, the servers were very friendly and we felt that they paced the meal perfectly. I can't wait to go back.  However, before you do, make sure to call and ask if the prixe fixe is on the menu that day because, when we first arrived, even though it was a Thursday at noon, the waiter said that he had to check.

UPDATE: I came back, and learned that we are not limited to their packaged breadsticks for lunch. Instead, they have (free) focaccia bread. All you have to do is ask for it, and then someone will come around with a big pan of focaccia bread. Make sure to ask for the olive oil and vinegar too!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Went for Mother's Day brunch.  Every bite of everything was delish!  I even loved the sauce and meatballs and I don't eat those out EVER!  I'm Italian!  The food and desserts were to die for.  Service was excellent.  If you are in Vegas you NEED to go there!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews n had to try it,...this is the best Italian restaurant in las vegas. I had chicken marsala very good, caprese salad excellent n calamari a must."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. The food was excellent and the service was out of this world. Our server was prompt, courteous, and funny. Our drinks, appetizers and entrees were out quick and piping hot. Lots of attention to detail. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is always great. The service is great , food is great. We met the Cake Boss himself, Buddy V was in the restaurant and was super nice.  Nice to have this place around the corner from where we live."}
{"text":"WHO: I know all of you are TLC Cake Boss fans like I am, who wouldn't be?! So, for everyone in the world who LOVES Buddy V as much as I do, be a NERD and come eat here (Don't forget the pictures, lol!)

WHERE: Located inside of the Grand Canal Shoppes of the Venetian and or Palazzo.

WHEN: Monday through Sunday from 11:30am-10pm; Friday & Saturday from 11:30am-11pm. & most importantly, Happy Hour from 4:30-6:30pm! =D

WHY: BECAUSE EVERYONE'S DOING IT! Lol, just kidding. Wouldn't you like to take part in a sit-down lunch or dinner with your friends and or family in Buddy V's first restaurant in Las Vegas?! & also because Carlo's Bakery is going to open in a few weeks to months just right across the restaurant! SO PERFECT!

WHAT: The first time I came here, my family and I did dinner. As I walked into the restaurant and to the table, I noticed the perfectly dim ambiance that filled the entire room. I love ROMANTICKLE restaurant settings! It makes me HAPPY! 

Random Tangent: Sometimes I make words up so don't dictionary.com them because it most likely won't be in there. Haha

So as my family and I were seated, we were handed the menus and ordered. I love dinner with family because we purposely order something different so that we can try each other's food! Too good!

FOOD:
Chicken Parm- I personally got the chicken parm, and it was excellent! I wish there could have been a tad bit more spaghetti with it, but overall Yummy!
Margherita pizza- My younger cousin chose this pizza, and I'm glad he did because there were slices for every single one of us! SHARING IS CARING!
Nonna's Lasagna al Forno- My older cousin ordered the lasagna. From the bite I took, I remember wishing I ordered it! It was definitely a hearty meal because there were leftovers! Thumbs up!

DESSERT:
Buddy's XL Lobster Tail- As I was scanning the dessert menu, my eyes suddenly zoomed into this dessert! I absolutely love the flaky pastry shell that enclosed the yummy, creamy, and PERFECT custard cream! (Everytime I go to NY, I search for Lobster Tails!!)
Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake- My cousin is addicted to chocolate, as this made his eyes light up! I loved the hazelnut praline crunch, good touch to the chocolatey goodness!

I still want to try the rest of what's on the dessert menu!!! GIMME GIMME GIMME!

HAPPY HOUR: My cousin and I just made it in time for HH the other day, and we went HAM!
Grandma's Meatballs- The perfect tasty, softy GOODNESS! I love these meatballs!
Macaroni & Cheese Carbonara- I am a mac&cheese fiend! This mac was pretty good. I've never had it with peas, but it actually gave it a sweet taste, GOOD COMBO!
Calamari Fritti- Loved the grilled lemon pinwheels, banana peppers, and the tomato aioli! AIOLI!!
Meatball sliders- We couldn't get enough of the meatballs, so we had to order it in bread!

Lastly, try the \"CAKE BOSS\" chocolate martini! If you love chocolate & alcohol, it was a really good mix! Tasted exactly like a chocolate cupcake... the only difference is it is in LIQUID FORM, and you may not be able to walk straight after! Lol

Before I continue typing, I am going to STOP and leave you with one thing... ENJOY!! & LET ME KNOW WHEN CARLO'S BAKERY OPENS! HOLLER! =D"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and the decore is beautiful.  I love the way the kitchen is open so you're able to see the food being prepared.  The surf & turf was good the steak was very tender. The olive oil  mashed potatoes were to die for! The staff was super friendly and made sure that our glasses stayed full and all of our needs were met. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"Really really wanted to give more stars because I am such a fan of the Cake Boss, but our meal was mediocre at best for the amount we paid for it.  The spaghetti and meatballs were extremely salty with little flavor otherwise.  

We did not have any dessert, but the cute pictures in the dessert menu we so wonderful!

The service was acceptable and friendly, but I'm not sure we will return.  Sorry Buddy

PS... Okay I decided to go back  2 nights later to give it a second chance. We heard the tiramisu was wonderful so we asked to get some to go, and they said they were unable to do so...... What a disappointment.  Two strikes and your out!"}
{"text":"A wonderful meal!  We chose to go with the family style and allowed them to bring us the selection.  Worth it.  I would go back just to have more of the marinara sauce.  Everything was amazing.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Peter made out night! What a great fun evening. The lasagna was AWESOME and I had 1/3 and shared the rest with the group. Grandma meatballs were way SALTY! My guess is that they sit in a bath of constantly evaporating liquid that just gets more and more salty.  We wanted to try famous desserts but were carb'd out after bowls of tasty pasta. Easy OpenTable reservation and to note is was Valentines day but we ate at 5pm."}
{"text":"SERVICE

{"text":"I was here a couple of months ago, dining solo, and had a 5 Star experience.  
I brought my family last night and was truly disappointed.  As soon as we got our drink order in, our server was difficult to call.  Our dinners were extremely salty and only 1 out of the 4, did we enjoy our food.  At one point, we had the manager come over to help us."}
{"text":"The ambiance was very nice.The restaurant seemed kind of dead for a Saturday night.I ordered the Lasagna and a glass of Moscato.The lasagna was very delicious and they gave a pretty nice portion.The bread they served with the food was ok but not great.But overall it was a pretty good eatting experience."}
{"text":"Due to the amazing spaghetti and meatballs, we had to come back! Again, the food was amazing! We did try the chicken parm and the caprese this time and were impressed with those as well. Definitely put this place on your list when in Vegas!  The service was great, we were well taken care of and left very happy! Just make sure to get spaghetti and meatballs!"}
{"text":"It was our last night in Vegas and my husband wanted Italian. Being from New York (and having an Italian husband!) my expectations were high. The restaurant had a nice, homey atmosphere with an open kitchen. It was fun to see the meals being prepped and watching them come out. We started with the caprese salad and fried calamari. The burrata was delicious. The calamari was crisp and light and very tender. For our main diss, we shared the Valestro family gravy. What a hit! We both loved the \"gravy\" ! Very authentic, homemade sauce..Italian husband said one of the best he's ever tasted. Portions were nicely sized. Sever was on point but not very attentive. One HUGE complaint..a bread basket was not provided!! A great Italian restaurant with no bread so sop up all of that saucy goodness??! Come on Buddy! Breadsticks in a bag! You can do a lot better than that! Lost a star on the bread issue...We will return on our next visit..with our own loaf of Italian bread!"}
{"text":"Came in for the happy hour specials and a drink or two... Loved the grandma'a meatballs!!! And would go back just for that.. We got Mac & cheese, ricotta cheese, and the calamari.. Also a cannoli... The food was great and the service was awesome.."}
{"text":"We chose this location on our last night in Vegas, which was a bad decision because we didn't have a chance to go back.  Our waiter was one of the best I've ever had!  The mozzarella appetizer was fantastic!  The lasagna is really the best I've ever had and the butterscotch creek brûlée is an event all on its own!  This is a must experience in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Food is great, atmosphere is comfy but it is pretty loud and if you're at a big table conversation is very difficult.  Service is very quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Great if you like pasta and Italian food. 

I think this would be a great fine dining experience if you like cheese and carbs.  I would have given this place 5 stars when I was a teenager. So take your kids here and buy them a cupcake at Carlos after."}
{"text":"While I still think dinner is a solid three, their Sunday brunch buffet is five stars all the way! 

I really don't like traditional breakfast food, and Buddy V's Sunday brunch had two egg dishes and one French toast dish at the buffet. Perfect! 

The buffet is divided into five stations: starters (charcuterie, shrimp, antipasto, soup, Caesar salad); carving station (props to the bacon and the spicy Italian sausage); Kids corner (Mac n cheese, pizza, candy); entrees (loved the meatballs, chicken Parmesan, carbonara Mac n cheese) and DESSERTS! Delicious tiramisu in mason jars, cannoli, and zonuts were my favorite. 

The buffet is $34.95. I opted for the extra all-you-can-drink mimosa deal for $14.95 and you can choose from mimosa, Bellini, sangria, beer or wine. The Bellini was tasty but that sangria tho! I'm embarrassed to say how many glasses I had. 

My fiancé got the Bloody Mary deal for $18.95 in which they bring the vodka and you craft your own Bloody Mary from a different station. He had fun doing that (and adding shrimp from the appetizer station) and he also got to choose from all my drinks. He ended up switching to the sangria as well and drank as much as I did. He got to keep his glass as a souvenir. 

We got seated right away with no wait (even during March Madness weekend) and I can't wait to come back. Wish it was served every day!"}
{"text":"Meh, Buddy V's is a 3.5 stars for me but rounding down because of slow service and complicated bill -_-

I made a reservation at Buddy V's for my birthday. We were a large party of 15 that seated us pretty quickly once our whole party arrived. I know that we were a large party but I just felt like the overall service was very slooow.....The older man (maybe the manager) walked us very s l o w l y....to the table and as we were seated, it just took a long time to get our utensils or menus. It was around 4:45 when we arrived and the restaurant didn't look too crowded at the time.

I am a huuuge fan of moscow mules and I make it a point to try a restaurant's signature mule. Buddy V's has a \"Jalapeno Mule\" on their cocktail menu and I was instantly intrigued and pleasantly surprised upon tasting it. It was bright and zesty, but the subtle kick of jalapenos would kick in afterwards. It's not a really overwhelming spice, but rather quite refreshing. Highly recommend trying this!

And for my meal, I ordered the linguini and clams and shared with my friend who ordered the sea scallops. Much to my disappointment, the linguini was super salty and extra garlicly. I didn't mind the garlic but the salt was just too much for me and found myself taking gulps of water in between bites. The sea scallops on the other hand were quite enjoyable. The creamy bed of polenta beneath the beautifully seared scallops complemented it well.

The dessert was probably the highlight of the meal. The Italian birthday cake was soo delicious. I'm not a big fan of desserts because I don't have much of a sweet tooth but the sweetness of all the different layers was not very overpowering in this. I loved the chocolate mouse layer. So dreamy....

It was time for the check and here's where things got unnecessarily complicated. Again, service was slow and we seemed to be waiting for forever for the check to come out. Prior to even ordering I had asked if we could split the check into separate bills, by tables, since we were a large party. They had forgotten, but no big deal, I asked them if they could fix it and they said they would. We wanted to split the bill to put it on two separate cards. When they brought back the check and I took a look at it, I was so confused. Our server had literally split everything on the check in half (see my photos), which made it 39247038x more difficult for my party to figure out who we needed to pay back. I clarified with our waiter what I wanted and off he went to fix our check. What could possibly go wrong? So instead of just ringing up another two new bills, he took a looong time trying to move halves from the two checks around. So instead of \"linguini and clams\" on the bill it said \"1/2 linguini and clams\" twice. He spent a long time trying to move things around but didn't move everything properly. I think it would've taken equally as long to just create two new bills where each meal was not a half.

So yeah, that was frustrating to deal with. Everyone was getting grumpy because we had been in the restaurant for so long because of the slow service and we were ready to leave after two hours of being there. But our waiter did try...and he was nice...just not efficient. Overall, good food and a nice interior! However, I was expecting a little more from the service since it wasn't too crowded but hey, they tried."}
{"text":"I came here Wednesday night for dinner with my mom, dad, and brother. The decor is very nice just like an Italian restaurant. Our server was very nice. For an appetizer, we started off with fried calamari, it was very crispy and delicious. For my entree, I had the classic cheese pizza and it was good. I also like their margherita pizza but I can't remember the last time I had it because I've been going to Vegas for the past 3 years. Can't wait to return for my next vacation!"}
{"text":"Buddy Vs is actually right outside the Palazzo parking garage. If you park in the Venetian parking garage you have a LONG way to walk. 
Excellent service and the food is just amazing--best Caesar Salad ever--however the noise level is off the charts---is extremely loud in the restaurant - we were there at 9pm and wasn't even full but seated across from someone you had to yell to be heard.  Overall great restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food!! Chicken Marsala is a must try. The rest of my group enjoyed their food as well. The spaghetti was also very good. Check this place out."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Served in a timely manner and with extremely fresh ingredients. HOWEVER, the staff is extremely unpleasant. The hostess had an intimidating face and seemed like she didn't like her job. The waiter was polite but not friendly. I would not come here unless I was dying for the food."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic! They were very fast and courteous. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the view of the strip. However, I wasn't a fan of the food. It's mediocre at best. My boyfriend's food tasted a lot better, but it wasn't enough to rate this place any higher."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of his bakeries, so I had high expectations and this place definitely delivered. Nice, swanky look to the place, GREAT view of the strip and even a giant billboard against the backdrop of the Wynn and Encore that was pretty cool to have there. I actually don't really like Italian food, but I thought the food was great. Great service too. The clientele was nice and above-casual. The desserts were amazing. Would definitely come here again. Best part is, when you leave, Buddy's famous Carlo's Bakery is right there!"}
{"text":"Took my 13 year old daughter there for her birthday dinner. She loves cake boss. We however brought our own cake and they were nice enough to store it in back.  Our server Perry was top notch and went above and beyond to please my entire family including finding candles for me because I forgot them. From beginning to end perfect service that complimented the tasty food.  You will not be disappointed.  Get a seat by the window so you can see the strip.  We will eat here again!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise!  I made a reservation for a coworker and I to have dinner here before seeing BAZ last night.  We were warmly welcomed by the hostess as well as our server 
- he was so enthusiastic and a pleasure to have help us.  I started with a glass of sauvignon blanc and we shared an absolutely delicious caprese salad - a little different than the norm...in a good way!  I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken rigatoni alla vodka as my entree and could have licked the rest of the sauce out of the bowl...it was that good.  Fun, lively atmosphere...especially after the piano player/singer started.  The restaurant was packed early, so that is always a good sign."}
{"text":"I went here last month with my parents because my mom is a fan of their TV show. I love Italian but I wasn't sure how well I'd like this place. It turned out to be be the best meal my whole trip. The spaghetti with bolognese sauce was fantastic. Even better I did not have to ask for extra sauce on the side. I can't remember the last time I didn't do that.

The wait staff was extremely polite and helpful. Our food was out to us in almost no time at all. The waiter even told my mom about a location opening in the city my parents live in. Thedecor was nice without being stuffy. There were old family photos on the wall as well as the dessert menu. It was a great value. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Sorry, I couldn't tell you about the food since we didn't get that far....

 Buddy might make this food for his family, but not allowing them to sit until the entire party is present is rude!!  I fully understand when it is busy, but there were so many open tables it was almost alarming.    We asked both the hostess and the manager (both rude and short) if we could sit and have a drink and we were told no, but you can go to the bar and get a drink.  Since a few of us worked in the industry, we understand the policy when it is busy, but when it is not I would think a good manager would make the right decision.  We felt like Greg Focker in Meet the Parents when he wanted to board the plane. 

That's OK, Canaletto happily sat us (they were slammed btw) and enjoyed taking our $250 lunch tab along with the 2 additional friends who came when we were finished of our referral."}
{"text":"One of the newer restaurant that opened here at The Palazzo, it is located on the second level of The Grand Canal Shoppes, next to Barney's New York.

Came here on a date and yes, I do agree with a fellow Yelper that it IS a big spacious restaurant so it doe not give you the intimate, romantic/family style a Italian restaurant should be. But hey...it's located in a 5 diamond hotel right ON THE STRIP...what else can you expect?

To sum it up, everything we ordered was delicious. The service was great, our waiter was attentive the entire time keeping our drinks filled, napkins/utensils were delivered quick. 
We got an order of their famous meatballs as an appetizer. I believe it came with six. Perfect to start off with. The meatballs were very flavorful and they weren't puny little meatballs either.
For our entrees, I ordered chicken Parmesan and my date ordered a pasta dish. Let me tell you, like most restaurants here on the strip, portions were pretty big. I definitely had leftovers for the next day. My chicken Parmesan wasn't dried and they put the perfect amount of melted cheese on top. 
We also ordered dessert. Not a big fan of sweets to begin with and I was already full from dinner. But my date suggested we share something soooo....sure, why not? We ordered the canoli and it was wayyy toooo sweet for my liking. The cream filling....bleh....over powering. I much prefer a gelato or something if I ever get a chance to come back here.

Overall, this is a really good restaurant and I can see it thriving here at The Palazzo. Prices aren't as expensive as say, Dal Toro or Bouchon. If you're in the mood for Italian and kind of on a budget.....I definitely recommend Buddy V's.

(P.S.) Heard Buddy V is going to open up a bakery shop at the Venetian sometime in March 2014. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"We were a party of seven with reservations and were seated promptly. We started with their yummy bread with olive oil. Calamari, cheese bread and the mozzarella with pesto. All were delicious. Everyone loved their entrees. They were delicious and large portions. I couldn't finish half of my lasagna which made our son happy as he ate the rest. Highly recommend this restaurant if you love Italian food. Great decor and service."}
{"text":"Authentic In every way! The chicken parmesan is the absolute greatest ive ever tried. took one bite and my eyes watered from its perfection.  chicken was seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly as for the spaghetti it was paired with was nothing short of immaculate. 
Service was fantastic not once did we feel pressured to order as the waitress was very polite. I will say this place was one of the highlights of my vacating and I will be visiting again for seconds!"}
{"text":"Went for a late afternoon meal and cake for hubby's birthday. Great octopus very tender and salad dressing was superb. Also got charcuterie plate, very well done toasted bread cheese olives and 3 cured meats. BUT THE HIT OF THE EVENING WAS THE BIRTHDAY CAKE A CYLINDER OF HEAVEN the stuff dreams are made of. WILL GO BACK ON NEXT VISIT"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool and view of the strip is nice. The bolognese was very good but the meatball sub was so-so at best with bread so hard the stuff in the middle spilled out everywhere. The house salad was nothing more than romain and the lemon vinaigrette was incredibly salty...like bathed in salt. Not sure I'd come back, so many other good options that are in the same general are."}
{"text":"Great service and good food.

My husband and I came her w/ my sister in law and we sat at the bar. Our bartender was very attentive and polite. She always checked up on us and made sure our drinks were topped off. Overall, service was great. The food was good, but it wasn't spectacular. I got the spaghetti and calamari for an app to share, my husband got the chicken parm, and my sister in law got the shrimp scampi. The price was fair for being in Vegas but the flavor of the food was subpar."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding brunch , everything was fresh, and appealing. Good coffee.  The best dessert table.  There was also a children's table which was nice.  Worth every dollar we paid. There were 3 of us and we all agreed. We compared it to Bellagio, and Wynn and Buddy V's took first place in our review."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Great flavor for your taste buds! Service was good. Staff made sure you had everything to enjoy your meal. Friendly waiter and fast service during lunch. Great experience! Didn't get a chance to have dessert because we were so full from apps and entree. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Buddy V's has absolutely become the Italian restaurant gold standard on the strip. Not only is it an affordable meal but the food is exquisite. It's \"real\" Italian food that tastes homemade but is served in a Strip-type location and atmosphere. I especially love the ravioli. We've tried the Sunday gravy, the lasagna, the spaghetti, the Veal parmesan, the kale (which is amazing) and my favorite the parmesan polenta (delicious). Really I have never had anything that wasn't good at Buddy V's. The tiramisu is excellent (although I admit I was very disappointed when they went away from the traditional large portion down to the small mason jar). They used to have an amazing portion tiramisu  with surprisingly moist chocolate cake at the bottom. I have eaten a LOT of tiramisu all over the country and this is hands down the best. Even better than the great restaurants I enjoyed in NYC. If you'er a local or are in Vegas for a vacation, go to Buddy V's."}
{"text":"Eaten here a half dozen times now.

Straight up Italian food like I grew up on back home. All the favorite dishes like chicken parm and grandmas meatballs are killer. Great pricing and huge room. Great place for Happy hour in their massive bar area.

If you are in The Venetian or near by this is a no brainer if you are looking for a place to eat and drink at with friends."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes!
This guy does more than cakes, and he does it well!
We came here for Sunday Brunch and we were not disappointed! Everything was outstanding, and well prepared. My wife raved about the tomato soup, and she was right -- it was awesome!
Oh, and the waitstaff was amazing! Dirty plates didn't linger on our table, and our beverages were never empty. Great job!
Spend the money and indulge in this great experience!"}
{"text":"This was just bad. Charged us for meals we sent back and for a slice of birthday cake that we didn't want but they insisted we should get. $300 for a meal where only one dish was actually good (the chicken vodka). Went to Tao for nearly the same price and had the best sushi of my life... Buddy V's was just a waste of money."}
{"text":"Soooo I was mostly disappointed with my dinner last night.... I liked the ambiance of the restaurant and the Grilled garlic bread was really good but the salad, pasta, and dessert left something to be desired! My salad was pretty boring but I longed for another salad once I got the completely unseasoned pasta. I had to add wayyyy to much salt and pepper to give it some flavor. My friends pasta was also really really bland. Together our check was like $125 which is a bit expensive for a meal that you left feeling kinda blahhh about! At least in my opinion."}
{"text":"This was the answer to a several month long search for a simple but ass kicking great tasting Italian meal. It was a busy Tuesday night, so we took a bar seat and enjoyed the great bartending by Mike. We asked him about a wine, he said it was good. When he brought the bottle it was a screw top... I was a bit concerned with the screw top. We had the wine with dinner and enjoyed a great meal. We met some nice peeps next to us and had some great conversation and a most enjoyable evening. Thank you Mike and Buddy V\"s for a most enjoyable time and meal. We'll be back. Highly recommend for great tasting authentic style Italian food, with a classy twist."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Great space with tons of seating and a nice lounge area where you can wait for a table. The service is impeccable and the food is absolutely amazing. Fine dining is what it's about here. They have tons of tables with a great strip view. If you're in town and need a place to have a wonderful dinner, Buddy V's is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Really fantastic food! We ordered the cutting board, Burrata, Charred Octopus salad, eggplant parm, Nutella cake and washed it all down with a bottle of Far Niente Chard!! What a day!!!"}
{"text":"Classic Italian dishes. The benefit of this Italian restaurant is that in Vegas everything is expensive and this spot is reasonably prices.  They do not serve oversized portions so when you order do not prepare to get a giant plate that you can split.  Each person will need their own dish, but you won't really take leftovers with you unless you are staying at the Venetian anyways so it is perfect.  Priced and portioned well."}
{"text":"The weekend brunch was SPECTACULAR! Some of the most authentic and delicious traditional Italian dishes paired with incredible brunch staples(seafood, charcuterie, etc.)! 

The service was superior and definitely measured above board - friendly and attentive but didn't hover. I can not recommend a brunch spot anymore highly than Buddy V's! Whether it's a party of 2 or 20, this places delivers!"}
{"text":"Good southern Italian style cooking.  good meatballs which is key!  bone in veal parm was great.  reasonable prices and one of the few restaurants in large hotels with a window view of the strip"}
{"text":"I went here for Valentines Day and it was the best Italian food I've had in Vegas! Great service and pretty fast. A nice view no matter where you sit and pretty atmosphere/good music. I had the Chicken Parm and it was soo good. The Chicken Marsala was so tender too. And the fried mozzarella appetizer was delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I give it a three only because they took forever to bring our food. It did not feel like how Buddy describes it. Very slow service. Did not exceed my expectations for the first time visit."}
{"text":"Just went tonight with my husband for our anniversary. We were both nervous trying such a new restaurant but we were impressed. We had a great server, Daniel, who was very knowledgable about the wine and food. We bought a bottle of wine that turned out being amazing. My husband had
the chicken Parmesan and I had the chicken rigatoni with vodka sauce. Everything was so good and the only thing we could say is it didn't taste like restaurant food, it tasted homemade. We also had to order the lobster tail. Even after a bottle of wine and our dinner it was so light and airy. Amazing. When Daniel found out it was our anniversary he brought out a plate of Italian cookies and bottle of sparkling dessert champagne. It was such a great experience all around and next time we come to Vegas we will be coming back to Buddy V's!"}
{"text":"Nice place, but the crowd is a bit too casual and the food a bit lacking for a restaurant that costs two people $150 total, including two drinks each. 
$22 ravioli - nothing to write home about. 
Empty plates and glasses collected on our table before anyone finally decided to pick them up toward the very end of our meal. 
Kids leaving their table and running around the place -- not the fault of the establishment, but not the way I prefer to dine. 
I'm sure there are a lot better places to spend $150 for a meal in Vegas. If it were less expensive I would have given it three stars."}
{"text":"Cake Boss? Where's the cake? They barely serve cake. The ravioli with tomato sauce on kids menu -which they were not serving until 5p and we were there at 4p. My Margarita Pizza was to thick and tasted like something I could make in the oven out of a box. We ordered a $9 apple pie for desert and Sara Lee does better."}
{"text":"I'm a local and when friends came into town to attend a wedding (officiated by Elvis, no less) I suggested Buddy V's for a late lunch, even though I'd never been there before. 

3pm is a perfect time to visit! It's slow in the restaurant, but the service is top-notch. They even had a specific menu for 3-5pm which was a-little-lunch-a-little-dinner. Here's what we chose and the consensus on each.

1. Meatball Sub and Fries: Good! large meatballs, delicious marinara and cheese, crusty bread, tasty fries that seemed almost batter dipped. I ate half so I'd have room for dessert.

2. Chicken Avocado Club Thingy: Good! The Caesar salad that came with it had what looked like croutons on top, but really they were a fried cube of something - we thought polenta - with a mildly lemony taste. Really added to the salad and surprised in a good way.

3. Margherita Pizza: Good! The person who ordered this enjoyed it a lot. I had a bite and thought it was good. One other person at our table thought it was horrible. Whatever. I'd still give it a solid B+.

4. The Meat and Cheese Board: Excellent! Our difficult-to-please patron got this and enjoyed it immensely. It had 4 kinds of Italian cold cuts, very fresh and very good, sliced thin. A few hunks of cheese (the Parmesan was to die for!) and some olives and other pickled veggies rounded it out. There was also some toasted bread.

Nobody finished any of their meal, and it was boxed and given back to us in a pretty bag with utensils and napkins for later.

We'd saved room for dessert and got the XL Lobster tail with fresh fruit, lemon sorbet, and the caramel creme brulee.

All of them were very, very good, but I've got to say that hands-down, that was the BEST creme brulee I've ever had. EVER. And I love creme brulee. And it wasn't even my dessert!

I'm not ashamed to say, I used my finger to get the last of the creme brulee out of the bowl. Well, maybe I'm a little ashamed. 

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that, while everything was good and fresh tasting; it lacked something. Very good, but not indistinguishable from other good Italian meals that I've had. I'd love to say \"there's nothing out there like Buddy V's\" but I can't. Yet.

I think I'll have to try again, just to make sure."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow, is all I can say! This place is heaven on earth! Ask for the express lunch menu if available, best bang for your buck. For $22, you get a three course meal. For dessert I recommend the cannoli or the tiramisu."}
{"text":"Great food...wonderful service.  Had the opportunity to take a picture with Buddy.  Thrilled to hear that he may be opening up in Chicago.  What a nice change from some of the chef owned restaurants...they are very accommodating and strive to please the customer."}
{"text":"Great food!

We dined at Buddy V's for our anniversary.  The service was fantastic and the food was amazing.  They serve the best warm focaccia bread with olive oil & balsamic while you wait.  

We both had the linguine & clams with sides of polenta and broccolini.  Usually when you order linguine & clams you get very few fresh clams in the shell.  It's typically just enough to add some theatrical value.  But this place piles them on.  We both were given a lot of fresh clams in the shell.  The white wine sauce was excellent and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.

There was no room for desert so we didn't get to try any of Buddy's famous confections.  Next time.

Only complaint... When you're coming from the valet parking garage the place is sooo hard to find.  The signage in the Venetian isn't very good and every person you ask sends you a different way.  We walked around that enormous hotel for more than 20 minutes looking for this place and almost gave up.  The staff acknowledged that it happens frequently."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect in terms of fanciness or price. My husband and I came here to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and we were very pleased with our service, the food, and the ambience. 

We've watched Cake Boss before but we didn't know this was THE Buddy from Cake Boss. The bakery was right across the way but we were so engrossed in our conversation and the yummy food we didn't have time to get any sweets for the way home. 

We each orders from the Prix Fixe menu....I got the Tomato/Basil soup, Chicken Parmigiana and the Tiramisu. Everything was perfect!!! I'm always on the hunt for good tomato soup and it was delicious!!!!! My husband ordered the meatballs, carbonara, and canoli and he said everything was yummy as well! 

Our server was great and attentive...she was training another server but it was never awkward or intrusive. The manager came over also to check on us and wish us a Happy Anniversary. The restaurant was very busy, even for a Wednesday night, but we never felt neglected....we always had people checking on us. We had a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife during our anniversary trip to Vegas. I have nothing bad to say about this place. It's not necessarily a romantic atmosphere but that's just Vegas in general. Doesn't matter where you go, there's always someone in shorts and a crappy t-shirt and flip-flops. Having said that, we still managed to have enjoy a nice romantic evening. The waiter was great. The chicken parm was great, the corozza was great, the lobster tails and Italian birthday cake were of course great. And just because I needed to try the tiramisu, we came back a few days later. And of course, that was great too. Nice touch with a little bit of chocolate cake in the bottom. I liked that the place wasn't overly crowded and we could go and sit down pretty much whenever. It was certainly one of the highpoints of our trip and I very much look forward to going back. And next time, I'll look forward to stopping into the Carlos Bakery shop opening up just next door. I know some complained about the pricing. I would argue that once again, that's just Vegas. Cocktails cost pretty much $14 wherever you go, unless you're sitting at the slots, and restaurant food is pretty much always $20+ for entrees. That's just the way it is."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Georgio was amazing, he made our experience soooo memorable and made some incredible Menu recommendations.  Our entrees were great, wines selection was extensive.  Xoxo"}
{"text":"I will say this, it is nice to see service return to Veags in a big way. From the minute we walked in we felt like family. Awesome, awesome, awesome friendly folks and they really care. Food is fabulous."}
{"text":"You only want to read one line?, \"So good, at least gotta try it\"...

Got there around 9:50pm (they close at 10pm) and the service was great, our server was super nice and really willing to help us make decision and stuff. On a side note: her recommendations were upstanding. We were not planning to have a full meal there, just desserts and coffee (at least I wanted coffee, 10pm? Yes, but it's Vegas). 

Everything was amazing! The coffee, the Nutella Volcano (or something like that), the tiramisu and the cocktails, the bella regazza wow, tbh we had 2 and it was not for the ladies at the table. 
The place is \"hard to find\" have to really look for it inside the Venetian but I'll be worth it. I don't feel that there's the need to say this but, the place is kinda pricey (obviously)."}
{"text":"Had a Chicken Parm that was off the charts amazing!  A friend that was eating with us ordered the Veal parm, I had never seen a piece of veal that big, I thought they had brought out a small breaded pizza.  The veal was also amazing. 

The atmosphere was casual but the view of the strip was incredible.   We had a great waitress that not only had great recommendations and fast service but also gave us directions on the quickest way to get a cab for our next adventure of the night."}
{"text":"Food was great.  For the quality you cannot beat the price.  Wait staff was excellent.  Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"We came by earlier on a Friday night after we got off our flight. We thought this was just going to be a touristy spot with mediocre food off the Vegas strip... and we were delightfully mistaken. The food was actually great. The calamari was fantastic, and the Salmon was terrific. Our server and bus boy were all super friendly and very fast accommodating us. The prices weren't terribly expensive either, so overall it was a surprisingly great experience! Others have mentioned to make a reservation, and I'd recommend that! I think we got lucky to be able to walk in. Either way, great place to eat if you're nearby!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing the food was so good! Sunday gravy was the best Italian dish I've ever had and I'm from Chicago we are known for the best food! I recommend coming here . Grazie"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to trying this place bc I love watching cake boss when I saw that he had a restaurant here in Vegas I had to try it. The hostess was nice and sat us down quick but overall look of this place I wasn't impressed at all, waitress was slow and took forever and when our food came out I wasn't falling in my chair in love with it. Taste like every other Italian restaurant every where, nothing special or wow factor about it. It was really disappointing to come here and think that the food would be over the top to die for yummy and turns out it was nothing to recommend to friends. Probably my first and last time here, also it is pretty price for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Peter is amazing! The service was great and Peter, our server, was so accommodating and sweet! He made a recommendation for the linguini with clams which was delicious! We had a blast and Peter even gave us canolis to go! Thank you Peter for making our first visit to Buddy V's so great! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant. I ate the shrimp scampi and it was amazing. The portions are very big so make sure you're hungry. For dessert the nutella cake is super delicious the cake super moist and soft."}
{"text":"Another outstanding meal at Buddy V's.  The cheesey garlic bread is to die for.  I have never had garlic bread with that much flavour.

I had the free range chicken breast with fingerling potatoes and spinach.  Juicy chicken with outstanding flavour and an amazing presentation.

This restaurant hits it out of the park every time we eat here.

We hope to be back in Vegas in 2018 and will definitely be back.

Thanks for making our Vegas experience that much better."}
{"text":"Before we get to food or ambiance, first you have to find the place - which is buried in the maze of the Venetian / Palazzo Canal Shops.  I have been to the real Venice many times and I swear it is easier to find your way around there than it is around the Canal Shops.  At least the real Venice has guidebooks with maps.  It would be helpful if Buddy V's website would at least give a clue, like saying \"We are on the second floor, about 30 yards down a hallway from Barney's New York, and overlooking the porte cochère facing the Strip.\"  Would that be so hard?

So, anyway, after a few wrong turns and roaming around for 10 minutes I'm a little grumpy but we find the restaurant.  My first impression is that someone crossed a mob restaurant from Jersey with a Chuck-E-Cheese.  Very bright.  Very loud.  Very crowded.  Lots of kids.  Hard chairs at the tables, although the booths looked comfortable.  (The booths were all full at 6:00 p.m. on a Wednesday.  Whatever criticisms I have about this place, they sure don't seem to be keeping the customers away.)

The wait staff was attentive.  Drinks came quickly (I needed one), along with a piece of foccacia bread and some olive oil and vinegar for dipping.  We were here for restaurant week, which meant ordering off of the prix fixe menu.  I started with Grandma's Meatballs; they were not the best I've had.  They had a kind of a light, mousse consistency and not much (if any?) sauce.  Well, I've never understood the iconography of \"Grandma\" as the pinnacle of  the culinary arts anyway.  Personally, I'm more impressed by training at the Culinary Institute of America and a few years working in a Michellin starred restaurant, but hey - maybe your Grandma was a better cook than mine.

My entree was the roasted sea bass, and that was a very nice piece of fish.  I also had a side of Mac & Cheese Carbonara, which was excellent,  My wife had a Cesar Salad and a pasta entree, and she enjoyed them both very much.  For dessert we each tried the cannoli, which was kind of mediocre.  That surprised me, since Buddy V is known, first and foremost, as  baker.

The $40 prix fixe menu was a good bargain, although the prices on the main menu were definitely creeping into the \"fine dining\" range.  Oh, it's not Sinatra or Giada's by a couple of hundred dollars, but it wasn't priced as a family restaurant either, even though it felt more like a family restaurant.

So, time for the trek back to the parking lot.  At least we didn't get lost this time, and the Venetian is one of the few Strip hotels that still provides free parking - hat tip to Sheldon Adelson for that."}
{"text":"The best meatballs. We always order it. We also get the garlic cheese bread. We also ordered the Tiramisu~~~amazing !!!!!!
We always come here when we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! I HIGHLY recommend!!! We had the meatballs and cheese garlic bread, chicken parm, and lasagna. This was hands down our best meal yet! WARNING the portions very large! One of the meals could have filled my husband and I but we were piggies and had to try more LOL! First my husband is Italian and VERY picky about his sauce and this fit his criteria for good sauce. The chicken was fresh and the breading was light but crisp. The the lasagna was outstanding I can't say enough about it. The filling was cheesy, there was meat but not too much, and the sauce was fantastic. We ended the meal with a cannoli that was very well done. Usually the ricotta is too gritty for my taste and this was creamy with just enough sweetness. We seriously can't say enough good things about this meal! If you get the chance to come it is a must. Our only regret is that we couldn't eat more! 

My husband would like to add that his ONLY complaint is that the chairs felt cheep."}
{"text":"Another fabulous meal with superior service from Randy! Each dish was delicious....we ate the Pasta E Fagioli, Sea Scallops, Veal Parm Chop, Chicken Parm, & My Mother-in-Law's Capellini Shrimp Scampi.
The Italian Birthday Cake was tasty & so cute!"}
{"text":"I was slightly skeptical thinking it would not be good. The apps are average. The pastas...exceptional! Pomodoro was perfect, the lasagna is super huge and delish and the pasta alla vodka was amazing! All of the pasta is perfectly cooked. Oh, and make sure you leave room for dessert. The tiramisu had a chocolate cake surprise at the bottom. I hate the word moist but that's exactly what it was...MOIST. I couldn't stop eating it. Nice views so ask for a table by the window. The restaurant is not easy to find so just ask for directions...don't wander around."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly. The staff are great. Friendly, professional and attentive but not overbearing. 

The food is outstanding. My daughter is a very picky pasta enthusiast and she said it was the best pasta she has ever had."}
{"text":"Best happy hour on the strip! My friends and I were staying at the venetian so we decided to try this place as it was right in the hotel. Luckily, we made it in time for happy hour - drinks were $4 and food was $5! The regular dinner menu itself is a little pricey so the happy hour is definitely a steal. 

We all got a round of sangria - perfect amount to get you a little tipsy at dinner! For $4, the drinks are the best deal because you can't get a $4 cocktail anywhere in Vegas. We ordered some of the $5 appetizers from the happy hour menu for dinner. We all got an order of the meatball sliders which is their famous Grandma's meatballs in small burger buns. I would highly recommend ordering these! The flavor was delicious and it was a good size. We also ordered calamari to share, and tried the mac and cheese carbonara. The calamari was nice and crispy, and came with fried jalepenos. The mac and cheese was okay...super creamy and the noodles were a bit overcooked. 

Service was a little slow as there was only one waitress for the outside happy hour patio. But would highly recommend coming here for happy hour for some drinks and snacks especially before going out!"}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette dinner and I have to say I was pretty impressed. It was a pre-fixed menu so everything came out pretty quickly. The bridal party selected the items before arriving and I thought they made great choices. We had the following items:

Starter: Margherita pizza 
Appetizers: Grandma's Meatballs
Mains: Chicken Rigatoni and Spaghetti Bolognese
Desserts: Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake and Cannoli 

It came with huge portions so even though we were all sharing, we had tons of leftovers. My favorites were the meatballs and the nutella cake. I would highly recommend this place and I would definitely like to come back and try to rest of their menu"}
{"text":"Great service, great food!  Chicken parm, spaghetti with meatballs, chicken marsala, and Caesar salad all very good!  You will probably need a reservation as this place typically has a long wait.  Request a table by the windows overlooking the strip!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent!! The meatball appetizer a must!! It was just like my aunt made. The orecchiette pasta with sausage was delicious. The lemon drop martini was very good. I wouldn't order the brocollini appetizer again. The focaccia bread was delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! We were beyond impressed with the food and service. William did a fantastic job checking on us and answering questions. The food was incredibly delicious and the staff is very efficient. I would highly recommend checking out Buddy V's if you are looking for somewhere new as a local or are visiting Las Vegas. Buddy V is also known as Cake Boss. Across the way you'll see his other store, which always has a long line. We made a reservation because we went at 5pm. I would recommend making a reservation to ensure you are seated quickly. Within minutes the place was packed for dinner. They also have  great happy hours specials I would recommend checking out."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. It taste like good homemade Italian food. Huge portions 2 people could split a dinner.  
I only gave 4 stars because. We were trying to have a nice dinner of just us 2. 
And the hostess puts a party of 8 right next to us when there were available tables not right on top of us. Plus they were extremely loud. It really took away from our celebratory dinner!"}
{"text":"What a treat this place was. We arrived without a reservation around 6 pm and were able to get seated right away. The hostess asked if we wanted to sit in their patio and we agreed but once there we quickly changed our minds. We found ourselves sitting out in the pathways of those coming in and out of the Venetian Canal Shoppes. We asked if we could be moved over to the bar and this was no problem. There was plenty of seating in the bar area and this is were we stayed and made it just in time for happy hour. They have some food items as well as alcoholic beverages for $5 and ends around 630 pm. I ordered a Caesar salad and the Eggplant Parmesan and my friend ordered chicken Parmesan and carbonara from the menu. Our app was calamari. It was all delicious and plentiful. So filling in fact that we had enough to take home. The true delight was in the tiramisu which came in a little mason jar. That alone would make me return. The bartenders were wonderful and definitely sold us on our meals. We really enjoyed the service as well as the food."}
{"text":"Pass...  We love Cake Boss, so this place was a no brainer, despite bad reviews on Trip Advisor and some here.  The service was wholly underwhelming, except for the thin older gentlemen who filled our water and brought us bread, he was the only good part of the evening!!!!  The server was courteous but rushed she paid us little attention and it took forever to place an order, to get a dessert menu, and get the bill.  We definitely did not feel like Famiglia:(  Sorry, Buddy, this place needs LOTS of customer service training.

Food: Meh, the lasagne was forgettable, my wife liked the Sunday Gravy OK...  Portions were HUGE, Italian Birthday cake was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Hearing so much about Buddy V's cake boss, I was eager to try out his restaurant as well and it was so perfectly placed right across from the cake boss.  It was perfect timingly as there was absolutely no wait time when we went and we were seated right away.  So my husband and I both decided to try his pasta, but we first started off with his meatballs as an appetizer.  They were decently sized but to our disappointment, there was not much flavor to it.  We were expecting a burst of flavor but there wasn't much to it except for ground meat.  Not much seasoning to it at all and it was honestly, something that I make better at home.  For the main course, I ordered the chicken regatoni \"alla vodka,\" which I always have to try at all italien restaurants.  It was pretty good except a bit on the salty side.  My husband ordered the \"my dad's bucatini carbonara\" which he thought was just ok.  Our waiter was very helpful and did suggest the meatballs for us to try.  Everything else about the restaurant was great."}
{"text":"I am not an Italian food snob or claim to know how, \"good Italian food should taste.\"

The not so good - Calimari. It was very chewy and may have been a little undercooked. The sipping sauce was pretty good, had a bit of chipotle/spicey flavor to it.

The good - my wife and I split a plate of Chicken Rigatone A La Vodka. This meal was very flavorful. The noodles were large and had chunks of chicken mixed in with it. The vodka cream sauce was very tasty, I would order this again.

They are a little cheap with the bread but it is great and quite frankly I dont need to eat it anyway.

The service - friendly but a little slow.

I would go back!"}
{"text":"The Restaurant Is Nice. Food Is Ok Lasagna and Grilled Cheese Bread Were Stars Of Show But I Was Disappointed With Chicken Parmigiana. So Many Positive Comments But It Was Honestly Bland Besides The Cheese Being A Good Quality."}
{"text":"The food really just isn't good. Bland, dry, and not cooked well. The reviews made it sound like traditional Italian cooking, but it tastes like a tourist trap. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"We wanted to try dessert from Carlo's Bakery, but the line was extremely long.  Instead we decided to come to the restaurant which is across from the bakery. We sat in the lounge/bar area.  The desserts we had were the Buddy V's XL Lobster Tail (custard cream, flaky pastry shell, and seasonal fruit), and the Cannoli (cinnamon pastry, sweet ricotta cream, cocoa drops, pistachios).  LOVED the lobster tail!  If you're dining here, save room and share this incredible dessert!  I will come back for dinner the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Tomato soup was delicious, caesar salad had lots of chicken."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to visit the new Buddy V's at the Venetian Las Vegas. We found the outside menu to be very interesting and the offer of happy hour irresistible!  unfortunatly, the man we met at the front desk did not share our excitement.  He acted irritated with our presence, but when asked, directed us to the upper level of the restaurant as the appropriate area for happy hour values.  after selecting a place to sit, we were accosted and told not to sit \"there\" as \"that\" isn't happy hour seating, \"this\" is happy hour seating.  (beware the hi top tables as they angle your drinks to the floor). Our poor waitress (April) seemed very unhappy to see us. She described a few of the beverages when asked, but after ordering \"bellinis\", she told us the Bellini machine was broken. When asked if the drink could be served on the rocks, she acted shocked and said it was impossible as it was made from a mix. We heard the bartender say the machine wasn't quite ready. When quizzed, the waitress said it wouldn't be ready for \"hours!\". We settled for the house red, and let me tell you, i do mean settled.  the transparency of the liquid lent itself more to watery cool-aid, with legs and bouquet to match. We did sample a pasta appetizer, which might have lead us to believe the food was worth putting up with the service, but a smart phone app lead us to better Venetian opportunities. Our party was met with a hostile glare as we were fleeing the establishment, and i was forced to resort to mad dogging the man(ager?) to make good our escape. 
greeting cold, directions sketchy, service irritated, food potential but unknown, farewell hostile.  1/2 star...."}
{"text":"We came in for a early dinner around 4 pm. Excellent service today from our server Brittney.  She knew the menu and gave us good recommendations. All our orders were excellent. We had the Lisa warm Nutella cake for desert that was awesome!!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere, the decor, everything. Server's are extremely nice and the food is beyond phenomenal. However, they lost a star because I asked for the dessert menu for more than 4 times, that's about it from my experience. GOOD JOB BUDDY"}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago.  Just had an appetizer:  the Mac and cheese.  Made with fontina cheese, it was very rich and delicious.  Enjoyed it better than Yardhouse Mac & cheese."}
{"text":"Omg...I was caught off guard here. Being Italian and a pretty good cook myself I was surprised by how delicious, flavorful and well prepared everything was. Had the meatball appetizers which were like my grandma used to make and a little better shh don't tell. ;-) next I had the shrimp scampi....it was perfection for me, jumbo shrimp with spinach, tomatoes in a divine sauce. Buddy you hit this one out of the park for me. On side note, atmosphere is great, comfortable restaurant, excellent service. Will be returning, perhaps once more before I head home."}
{"text":"Beautiful Mediterranean sea bass, crispy, moist and great service! Had the \"lobster\" desert oh myyyyyy."}
{"text":"This is my second time around at Buddy V's......
Very good food, going-rate prices for the strip, and the ladies working the tables and hostesses are as stunning as they are efficient."}
{"text":"Visited Buddy's restaurant 5 nights ago. My friend and I sat at the bar and were taken care of by a wonderful bartender Miko. He was pleasant, funny, and totally on his game as far as drink orders (ask him to make you something - he's got a few awesome drinks up his sleeve!). He definitely steered me in the right direction for dinner - the cheese raviolis are out of this world! We also had a few appetizers that ended up being a meal - grandmas meatballs were heaven, the mozzarella cheese appetizer was not like anything I've had before (in all the right ways), and the antipasti plate was this awesome combo of cheeses and meats and olives that I was swooning over. The only bad part? No room for dessert! Guess I'll just have to go back next time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"Very good meal, timely reservation and service!  My only complaint would have my balsamic salad dressing was below standard although the ingredients of the salad were good quality.  The Lasagna is a mega-meal onto itself.  The Tomato Basil soup was good and my wife loved her Spaghetti Bologanese.  The Raspberry Sorbet was excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff and food. Only gripe would be please put bread on table not the bread sticks. Especially if crowded. We had chicken parm and veal marsala. Both very good. They serve whole wheat pasta which is nice."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great atmosphere, and amazing food. The cannoli was to die for!  The do a brunch on Sunday's or we would have gone back a second time. It's a little hard to locate, but make sure you do!"}
{"text":"Mouard was our server and was excellent in attitude and service throughout our dinner. My brother is a huge fan of the show Cake Boss and was start struck to eat there, but the manager Kristina Poole really tipped the cake off with a signed Buddy V Carlo's bakery flier, a coffee cup and water bottle. Thank you for making his experience that much better and definitely deserve a rare review from me here. Keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"I just had the best chicken parmesan ever. The service was attentive, every time I looked someone was filling my drinks, asking how I was doing and bringing me food. I ordered off of the lunch express menu. For $22 I received 3 large meatballs, a full sized chicken Parmesan and a cannoli. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place and finally glad we did! Their happy hour from 4:30-6:30pm everyday is by far my favorite in Las Vegas right now. They have $4 drink specials including sangria and bloody Mary's that were delicious. They're appetizers were $5 plates and everything we have was amazing. What made my mouth drool was the meatball sliders with ricotta cheese. I don't usually like ricotta cheese but it totally made these sliders out of this world. The calamari was also a favorite with having deep fried banana peppers mixed in as well. If you are looking for a good happy hour, this is your place to go!"}
{"text":"Just had a brunch buffet at this place.  Live music and great foods.  It's one the best in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This Place Is SHADY!!! Our server was the biggest swindler of them all. We ordered a Stella and he said \"medium or large\" we go with the smallest being the medium. When the bill comes the Stella Beer was $16. I inquired on why so much and they said because you keep the glass. I said we wanted the beer with no glass and they said that's the only option. The bus boy came around to clear off the table and he said they do have a smaller 12oz version without the stupid souvenir glass for which we weren't given the option.

Then for dinner my daughter asked for a white pasta instead of the kids spaghetti. Waiter said he could do a kids Alfredo. Come the bill was a charge for a $20 Alfredo when the other kids entrees were $12. We had to ask the manager which quickly took care of the problem.

I personally ordered a Caesar salad and as the waiter walked away he said he would being enough to share. Bill comes and were being billed for a huge family portion for which 2 people ate and more than half was left.

The cocktail we ordered was too sweet and liquor. We could have got a better value and experience and mastros for the cost paid. We dine out 3-4 times a week and know the routine of value, quality, service and overall customer appreciation. This place provided NONE!
 
The overall experience sucked, service sucked and we were left feeling like we were takin advantage of.

Steer clear of this over priced and over rated restaurant."}
{"text":"Best tomato basil soup I have ever had! I also had the margarita pizza, it was not the best pizza I was disappointed. My wife had the Chicken Parmesan it was fabulous."}
{"text":"Lasagna is amazing, Sunday Gravy is also awesome! Will return soon to try other dishes!! Deserts amazing also!"}
{"text":"Staied at Vegas for 3 days with my wife and randomly walked in to this place after check out the pictures of their food. People who gave less than 4 stars probably had better Italian food than we do. This is the best one so far we have ever tasted."}
{"text":"We vacation in Las Vegas several times a year and plan our dinners in advance.... Buddy V's is ALWAYS on our list. We love everything about this establishment! Not only is the food some of the BEST Italian we've ever had, the staff makes the experience. Thank you Emily, Nichol and Joy for another wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good! The service is great and so is the ambiance I will be dreaming about the food for months, it's that good"}
{"text":"Loved us some Buddy V's!

So, full disclosure...I've never seen Cake Boss. I ate here because they had great reviews and sounded like the homey kind of Italian restaurant I prefer.

Bestie and I were in a major hurry to catch our flight but had a hankering (and a reservation!) for Italian before we left Vegas.The hostesses were incredibly accommodating and let our server know we had a tight timeline.

As a result, we sat, ordered and ate - including dessert to go - and drinks in a mere 30 minutes! Clearly a dining world record.

Our server Kristin had impeccable recommendations. We started off with the caprese salad and then had lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs for our entrees. The pasta was cooked al dente as it should be. Everything was piping hot, fresh and flavorful. After the complimentary bread and breadsticks, there was no way we could eat all that food. Portions are this side of ginormous.

The manager Adam came by to check on us and chatted about other Vegas restaurants we had been to even offering future menu suggestions for a steakhouse we had been to the night before. He clearly runs a tight ship while making sure guests are well taken care of and well fed.

Will definitely be adding Buddy V's to my list of Vegas faves!"}
{"text":"Gosh, I hate to do this but honestly Buddy, you need to know. First, we went for lunch...ok, so its lunch. The bread was dry and stale. We mentioned to the server and she explained to us
we are here at lunch and bread is make in AM so it is older. The \"FRESH BREAD\" IS FOR DINNER\". Yikes~ We understood we have to ask for it at lunch but honestly, dry/stale bread?
ok, so even gets better. I ordered a Stella, took 15 minutes to reach me. ONLY ASKED AFTER desert arrived is I'd like another Stella? WHAT???? keep the alcohol coming. Its Vegas. 12 minutes for desert. They had to make it fresh...We were laughing that perhaps the staff was in the long bakery line outside the restaurant. Food was good/fair, SERVICE HORRIBLE. Your staff is going to kill your business and should not be tolerated. Our bill was wrong. you name it. and....the best of all--our friend ordered spaghetti/meatballs. He opted for sausage instead. So, he was $6 for CRUMBLED SAUSAGE? WHAT? We discussed with waitress and she was defensive telling him \"i distinctly told you it was crumbles\" Well, she did not tell him $6 for crumbles. Whole sausage are only available at DINNER? Not cool at all. His family needs to get over there and educated their staff or this place will FALL! I will NOT be back. We ate appx 3pm so not too off for dinner. Very disappointing experience :("}
{"text":"I love it when a place holds up to expectations. Not that I had anything to compare it to, other than fancy, but family style strip Italian places. I can't wait to return. I will take the long annoying walk from valet for it, it's that good. 
My sister and I took my dad here for his 60'th birthday. We didn't want to be too fancy, but still wanted authentic Italian food. I am so glad we went out on a limb and tried Buddy V's! 
They have a selection of appetizers, most named after a family member. Then for entrees they offer pasta, meatballs, veal, chicken, tons of Italian classics! As a family of 6 Italians at the table, I can tell you we were very satisfied. My dad wanted a veal picatta. They have chicken picatta, and veal angelo, so they didn't hesitate to make him the dish he wanted. 
I went with a Sunday gravy dish, and it exceeded expectations. The appetizer platter of select meats and cheeses was phenomenal! Literally the best prosciutto and blue cheese I ever tasted. 
We skipped on dessert because of course we went across the hall to Carlo's! I am sure it was the same cannolis, but it's the point! 
This will be an Italian place I continue to come to over the years. It hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner at Buddy V's last night for a friend's birthday dinner. I had been there before, she had not but i raved about it. 

We had a 7:30 reservation and showed up a few minutes early. We were seated right away which is always nice. We had a great table with a view of the open kitchen. 

Our server came over to bring our drinks but it seemed to take him a rather long time. This would be indicative of the rest of the meal.  As we watched our server he seemed to have tables all over the restaurant so every thing we asked for took a long time. 

Come to find out the server did have a servers assistant but it would have been nice if he introduced this gentleman to us so we knew who to ask for what. 

The food was good but I would not go back again any time soon."}
{"text":"Could only be better if it were a little quieter but I can't fault the restaurant for the acts of rude tourists that were not taught how civilized people dine out in public. 

The service was excellent and attentive, the food was perfect. The veal marsala is possibly the best I've had and I order it frequently. Great italian restaurant ambiance. We enjoyed totally, will be back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I did not know that Buddy can cook.  My overall satisfaction is definitely five stars I love his salad I would have never imagined that a Salad could taste so delicious; especially with the croutons and fresh mozzarella I even tasted the ground peppers on that salad.  I'm so glad that I went to his restaurant at Las Vegas it was once in a life time experience and the first time is always the best."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. Went there for dinner with friends Ina recommendation from our lunch server. The pasta was amazing and desserts were delicious. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The wife and the children enjoyed this place. The ambience is chill with an open kitchen. Right across from it is Buddy V's bakery but didn't get a chance to try their pastries. The food was good. We ordered the calamari which is a very generous portion. It was fresh and tasty. The kids enjoyed their pizza and we ate the spaghetti bolognese. The sauce was to die for. For desert the Nutella cake with caramel salted ice cream was the finisher and we were in heaven. We went twice in 4 days. That should say something considering the options in Vegas."}
{"text":"You tawkin' to me? You tawkin' to me? Fahget about it! Buddy Valastro's Italian accent makes my heart skip a beat, and the delicious dishes he's serving up at his self-named restaurant in Vegas will do the very same!

Work trip.  Boooo.  But in Vegas? Hell yeah.  I stayed at the monumental Venetian hotel and had the most luxurious suite of suites.  It was late.  I was tired.  I was hungry, and to make matters worse, I was indecisive of what to eat. (Don't you hate that feeling?)  One of my suppliers suggested grabbing a bite at a place called Buddy V's.  \"Oh like Eddie V's brother?\" I asked.  \"Nooo.  Buddy V's as in Buddy Valastro.  The Cake Boss,\" she replied. Ahhh.  How did I not know this?  

We grabbed a table towards the back, and I acquired the perfect view.  It was about 10PM and I was facing the Las Vegas Strip--the beaming lights shining down on the commotion of pedestrians as they scurried towards the various hotels and casinos.  For my first time in Vegas, this, ladies and gentlemen, was a sight!  

I gulped down the most delicious glass of cab, and ordered the spaghetti carbonara and added Italian sausage, per the waiter's suggestion.  It used to frustrate me watching Diners, Drive Ins and Dives because every other episode, Guy Fieri exclaims \"this is the best ________ I've ever had!\"  When you say that about every dish, what makes one different from the other? Driving my point home, the Spaghetti Carbonara at Buddy V's Ristorante was THE BEST PASTA DISH I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!! And I'm not Guy Fieri-ing you.  The pasta is obviously made in-house, and that sauce is ridiculously rich and creamy.  The Italian sausage just drove the dish right on home for me.

Buddy V's is... Simply put? OUT OF BOUNDS, and I can't wait to get back to Vegas and eat there again and again!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday Brunch. Expectations were low.The last brunch I had was at Yardbird, and if you read my review on that, you may understand why. 

Buddy V's offers about 25 food items, and 10 dessert items for a $35 price tag. They also offer a selection of unlimited alcoholic beverages for another $15. 
They also have a limited al la carte menu that offers pretty much everything that is already on the buffet, but why would you pay $23 for just chicken parm?

Here we go...

As we walked in, the aroma of GARLIC just punches you in the face! 

My! How quickly expectations can change. 

We were warmly greeted buy 2 pretty hostesses, and immediately sat at a table. I couldn't wait to look around. Our server greeted us, and went over the workings of the Sunday Brunch. We also got the unlimited alcoholic beverage option.

My lovely wife got sangria, I started with a domestic beer, then went a red wine. Sangria was great, and so was the vino. We stuck with that for most of the meal. 

As a foodie, I have to say ALL the food offered was FANTASTIC. If you like Italian comfort food, this brunch will satisfy all your needs, and make you eat way too much. 

I ate so much, I did not eat again till the following day. 

The italian sausage on the carving station (see pic) was luscious. The fritatta delish, orecchiette pasta amazing, the french toast unlike anything I've had before. Chicken parm was tasty. They put fried polenta croutons in that amazing fresh, cold, caesar salad. Meatballs were nice. My wife loved the ham on the carving station. 

EVERYTHING was so good, so good, so good. 

I visited the dessert station and discovered a totally different Tiramisu than what  I'm used to. This one was done with love. It was light, wet, and beautiful. The bread pudding and red velvet cake changed my mind about not liking bread pudding and red velvet cake. Hey, the cake boss apparently ain't no joke. These desserts were great. I can't wait to go back to try the Italian wedding cake.

I thought I was done after dessert, but went back to get more of that sausage and meatballs. With a little garlic bread of course. Also had a bloody caesar that was very good also. 

Did I mention how good everything was? Man! this place is my new Sunday after church brunch spot!

I've been to buffets on the strip that offer 3 times as much of a selection for about the same price. You know what though? No one could possibly try that much food. Even if you could, not EVERYTHING would be fantastic. The other thing I dislike about buffets is that the food is almost NEVER hot. 

Buddy V's Sunday brunch offers a smaller selection of fantastic HOT, FRESH food in a buffet style setting. 

The food is so good, that when you float out of there on a euphoric foodie coma trip the last thing you think about is the price. A total value experience."}
{"text":"Bone in parm chop baby - that's where Vegas life starts to get really good.

Had dinner with a group of friends last Vegas trip - I was impressed! Solid classic Italian. Very good food - prices aren't bad for the Strip.

Dessert - I have been avoiding them lately but the Lobster Tail Thingy (really, I think that's what it's called) was awesome.  No lobster in it (not a bad thing) just simple, buttery shreds of puff pastry filled with a slightly sweetened pastry cream.  Simple, but very good.  Totally rocked in fact!"}
{"text":"This was not just a dinner this was an EXPERIENCE!!! Food was incredible especially veal parmigiana! Omg I don't even eat veal GLAD WE TRIED IT! Big enough for left overs that are just as good later THE SAUCE IS AMAZING. I'm more impressed each time we go eat there! The eggplant appetizer amd calamari are like nothing I have ever experienced- anywhere! Butterscotch creme brûlée (even though I was stuffed) I could not stop eating! Fantastico!!!!!well done Peter Nick the manager and especially chef Bryan Forgione and entire kitchen crew! Love this place more and more"}
{"text":"The service and the food here were PHENOMENAL! Came here for my Aunt's 21st Birthday. I had the Carbonara, my aunt had the salmon and mash potatoes, and my two friends had the chicken parmigiana; EVERYTHING was tasty. The mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery, the carbonara had great flavor and was filling, and the chicken parm was sooooooooo good. 

I never had to look for my waiter or ask for a refill. There was always more person to help and meet my needs. I would definitely go back here. If you are looking for affordable (on average $40 for a appetizer and entree) meal while in Vegas, please go here."}
{"text":"Poor service, small portions, and the red sauce they use was wayyy too salty. Prices are in the higher range. The bread  was good. That's about all that was... Basically your just paying for the name. Never going back."}
{"text":"Delicious! We did Happy hour! Pam, bill, Dan an Lynn sat out side on there terrace enjoyed small plates an wine! Really good an service with a smile! Thank You"}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Relaxed, kid friendly atmosphere. Set up very similar to Olive Garden or Maggianos. Tons of servers and busers keep things moving quickly. Water refilled fast. Courses come out timely. They offer a fixed price menu - $40 for 3 courses. All the food was delicious. Portions are huge."}
{"text":"Excellent quick service with delicious food! Everything was cooked perfectly from soup to ente We had a wonderful time in a pleasent atmosphere with an attentive waitress!"}
{"text":"Very good food, pasta, lasagna, and appetizers. Nice views, cool atmosphere. Waitress a little impatient with dishes and order, and it was a little expensive for the money. But overall it's a safe option to eat great Italian food."}
{"text":"Do not bother...... simple simon way over priced.  All dried pasta, no fetucini alfredo, meat balls had bone chips. It was a tourist trap joke. 
  There are far better choices at venetian

Note to Buddy, rethink it bro, dried pasta, at least cook it perfect.  It cod not be simpler to make your own pasta.

I
Got spaghetti and meat balls 30.00"}
{"text":"Updating to add a star. Dinner experience was much better than brunch. Chicken parm was excellent and the cheesy bread as an appetizer was delicious! We had a reservation and was seated immediately.
*******

Pretty pricy for what you get. $35 each for brunch. $10 for bottled water at the table. Very little at the carving station. Chicken parm was out, but they did replenish it eventually. It was pretty good. I didn't see much else that I liked. Got some pizza from the kids section to try to fill up. Dessert was the highlight, but it didn't blow me away. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Can we talk about that chicken parm?! Can we talk about it?! G'DAMN!

This was the best chicken parm I've EVER had. Period. I wanna book a flight back to Vegas rynah just to have that dish one more time. They give you two huge chicken breasts covered in sauce and cheese along with perfectly proportioned pasta coated in just the right amount of marinara. I am drooling just reminiscing. 

Take me back, please! Someone take me back!

If you're gonna eat anything in Vegas, eat that. Do it for yourself, but more so... for me. Cause I miss that parm, man."}
{"text":"Much better than expected...thought it was another gimmick restaurant.  Very happy with all our dishes, we ordered 3 different appetizers and 5 entrees and 2 kids plates.  Would be 5 stars but hostess made me wait in front of her for over a minute before acknowledging me...not cool....just raise your head up and say I'll be with you in a second."}
{"text":"Solid Italian food!  I took my boyfriend to Buddy V's Italian restaurant at The Venetian, because he loves watching shows such as Cake Boss.  It didn't disappoint!  

We came around 5 pm in the evening, and I was pleased to find that the wait was only a few minutes, and that we were promptly seated.  The service was quick and respectable, as well. 

The food here is a bit upscale, but still not too bad.  We got two different carbonara dishes - one of them a macaroni carbonara!  I really loved the macaroni dish, although my boyfriend said he liked the pasta a lot more.  I thought they were both very creamy and rich with flavor, and tasted delicious.  They were also very filling, and we were full by the time we finished!  

They provide little packs with sticks of bread in them on the table, but I didn't care for them too much.  I kind of was wishing that they would provide some complimentary bread and olive oil like a lot of Italian restaurants, but they didn't offer any.  

All in all, a solid Italian restaurant at The Strip.  Very good, solid Italian pasta dishes, and efficient service.  A bit pricey, but reasonable for the type of restaurant that it is, and I feel I thoroughly enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"The bread! The pasta! The desserts!! I don't know where to start, but I do know that Italian food is one of my favorite genre of food (other than Thai or sushi) and I can be a picky one when it comes to taste. I must say the service at this restaurant was impeccable, and the food was all sorts of delicious. Their wine selection was pretty impressive so that is another plus. I recommend the Calamari for an appetizer or the mozzarella en Carozza, which is basically fried mozzarella. I have only been here once so the dish I had was the lasagna. I make lasagna from scratch at home so I know good lasagna, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Wow...
Had mozzarella and meatballs for appetizers that was good had a bottle of pinot noir.
Main meal: chicken parmigiano. ..ok
Scallops. ..boooo...this was terrible. ..fish taste like on verg of going bad, bacon tasted like old grease, the sauce don't even know what that was supposed to be, and for 32 bucks...booooooo. 
Lasagna was good..
Service was good 
I make better itialian at home"}
{"text":"I must admit I was a bit reluctant to try this place. After all, this guy is a baker not a restaurant chef and every celebrity food person has a place in Vegas and most aren't anything to write home about.  This place is outstanding. Their Cesar salad is a must. They serve it with warm polenta croutons. Talk about a bowl of heaven. Crispy on the outside and full of warm polenta goodness. Yes, I wrote 3 sentences about croutons. They are that good. After that I moved onto the scallops. Sweet, briney with the perfect sear on the outside. Delicious. This has become our must eat at place every time we pass through town. Great wine list, fair prices, excellent service. Worth a visit.

We made a stop for lunch and found the treat of a 3 course meal for $22. I got the Cesar salad, chicken parm with salted caramel gelato. The chicken itself was okay but the pasta was delicious. The gelato was worth a stop in itself."}
{"text":"First off the menu is not very impressive, kind of reminds me of Quick stop Italian joint, not a sit down restaurant. Your better of going to the polazzo and eating at carnivore. 

We started off with the mozzarella sandwich in marinara sauce which was pretty good. Very hearty and pleasantly seasoned. Then my wife ordered the chicken parm which she enjoyed. I ordered the meatball sub, I know what your thinking \"meatball sub how can you judge off of that\" well the waitress told me it was a signature and it sounded good for lunch. Well my take on the sub was the bread was great, a little butter action with the melted mozzarella, but the meatballs were not so good. The texture was not there for me, it was like the microwaveable meatballs, honestly if you blind folded me and but a subway sub in comparison I would probably pick the subway sub."}
{"text":"Bad experience for a celebrity restaurant.  My wife loved the cake boss show and she wanted to try buddies restaurant.  

There was HAIR in my food (gross) and the manager gave me some stupid excuse about the company that services the napkins \"whatever\".  Waiter was nice, manager was not pleasant in-fact dismissive about hair in my food.  

Buddy V \"Cake Boss\" well-known household name, good reputation in the food/restaurant industry and positioned  as high profile fine dining restaurant at The Venetian in Las Vegas. The experience was all but excellent: HAIR discovered in my food (GROSS!) and poor presentation of product (plates were extremely worn)."}
{"text":"Food and server were amazing. I got the shrimp scampi which was full of flavor. First time here and we will be back."}
{"text":"Best Eggplant Parmigiana I have ever had. My sisters (shared the steak) also loved their meal. The host was absolutely fabulous - didn't get his name but he is Buddy's cousin. He had an eye on everything and was always dropping in to all the tables to make sure everyone was having a good time and if anything was needed. Always managing to take away a stray glass or refill an empty one as he chatted. I asked for the appy Eggplant Parmigiana as I wasn't too hungry. When he brought it out he said \"don't get upset now but I upgraded you to the entree size, no charge, but it is just too delicious to eat just a small bit\". He was right - best ever and since my sisters took a fair bit off my plate, it worked out well. For dessert we ordered one cannoli to split. We were so full! Anyway what does he do but come out with 3 (no charge) because it would be \"terrible\" if we couldn't pick them up with our hands and  eat one each to ourselves. He was right again and they were incredibly delicious! Best host ever! Great dining experience!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant with a group 9 last Wednesday night. I had heard great things about this restaurant & being a foodie I was excited! First problem was they pushed 2 tables together resulting in them being uneven with each other = disaster when putting wine glasses down. Unacceptable .. Not even an apology or offer to correct the problem. 

Service was extremely slow and the restaurant was NOT full. We got our wine & beverages &'appetizers approx. 10 min before our meal came!! We couldn't even get a waiters attention to bring us wine! 

The food was average. Nothing I couldn't cook as well in my own kitchen. The dessert was a treat.. I will say the Cake Boss knows his desserts. That was about it. Sad to say I won't be returning to Busdy V's"}
{"text":"Our experience at Buddy V's from start to finish was easy breezy. Buddy V was able to accommodate a part of 15 girls for a Bachelorette Dinner. Prior to our dine in, the manager provided us with different menu options that would best fit our party. We eventually went with a pre-fixed course that included these options for about $64pp (including 8.25% tax and 21% service fees):

Under Starters- select 1
Appetizers-select 1
Mains-select 2
Desserts-select 2.

We selected the items below:
Starter: Margherita - 
Appetizers: Grandma's Meatballs
Mains: Chicken Rigatoni and Spaghetti Bolognese
Desserts: Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake and Cannoli 

Overall, all the dishes were delicious, a bit on the saltier side FYI. And of course we left with shameful amounts of leftovers (because that's what happens with girls in Vegas, we tryna look good in our night swim bikins, don't hate). The winner goes to Lisa's Warn Nutella Cake... this is a MUST order. As soon as the soft chocolate molten cake with warm gooey nutella inside hits your tongue, it will make you......mmhmm. Yes. Exactly THAT thought :)"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. Service is wonderful!! I came with my family in thanksgiving and everyone treated us like family. Talked to my kids and food was amazing. Just come and eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Today I ordered the Sunday gravy. Truthfully if my mother had made this type of food for my father it would've been Monday divorce. I started with a Caesar salad. Croutons on the Caesar salad were warm polenta croutons. Yuk! The rigatoni was overcooked bag rigatoni. The meat was over done. The sauce had zero flavor. Notably the pasta and the meat had two different sauces. That seems kind of strange since typically you would use the meat sauce on top of the pasta. I didn't stay for dessert got my check and went home."}
{"text":"My second time dining at this restaurant and I must say I'm a fan. I had the Chicken Parmesan and it was amazing. Two generous cuts with a decent portion of spaghetti cooked perfectly al dente. The dessert was wonderful as well, a unique take on Tiramisu inside a small mason jar with four ladyfingers set next them. All in all I would definitely recommend to everyone and I can't wait to go back and try other dishes on menu. Special thanks to the staff which were attentive and worked very well to ensure a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My father and I went for my 21st birthday and had brunch! We met the assistant manager and he was the most down to earth guy. Remembered us when he saw us the next day in the grand canal shops as well. The food... well it was the absolute best I have ever had. Must go for anyone in vegas!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went here after a show -- we were pretty much just starving and wanted pasta and this was the first place we saw. The wait was about 20 minutes so we just grabbed a seat at the bar easily which was great, however we were pretty much ignored for 15 minutes until the bartender finally came over. My friend asked for the wine list and the way she rolled her eyes you would think that's a dumb question (is that a dumb question?). When she finally came back another 10 minutes later to get drinks I asked for a food menu and that was also apparently really labor-intensive for her because she seemed crazy annoyed. The place wasn't that busy but I could tell she was the only one behind the bar which I can sympathize -- I'm a pretty patient person so if I have to wait it's not usually a big deal as long as you're pleasant when you do get to me. So that whole exchange was sort of a bummer. 

All that said the food was pretty good. Not the best Italian food I've ever had but it was straightforward pasta and good sauce. I had the rigatoni and my friend had the orecchiette and both were good enough that we finished them. 

Will I go back? Meh. But I am pretty excited the bakery is opening across the hall!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I asked for best tasting dessert and they delivered. Mouthwatering!!"}
{"text":"Had visit as soon as I saw the ad walking through the canal shoppes..this place did not disappoint!!! The salad is out of this word good and fresh. Buddy's signature pizza is great.. And the cannoli is what we came for especially. It was way better than expected..can't wait for Carlo's to open across the way...so coming back!!"}
{"text":"I was at the Sands Expo for ISC West and waited way too long for lunch.  Every place I went to had a super long wait so I was happy when I got into Buddy V's with a 5 minute wait.  
   The service was very good with the waiter being perfectly attentive.  The restaurant has a nice interior and despite  a busy lunch service was very clean.  
   I ordered the Veal Marsala which was priced at $26.  It came with garlic butter spaghetti noodles.  The garlic butter noodles were the highlight of the plate.  The veal was not even lightly salted and had no flavor.  The Marsala sauce was overly sweet.  It was ok but I have had much better.  I was starved so it filled the void.  
   I wasn't impressed so this was my last and only visit to Buddy V's."}
{"text":"I wish there was 0 star bc this place deserves it. We went here to order cannolis for Xmas tomorrow. We ordered 8 and had them put the cream separate. They charged us then 15 min later while we were waiting charged us an extra 33.00 bc we asked for the cream separate! They never told us this when we ordered or we would of told them just to leave the cream inside. On top of this the staff Jacqueline was so rude. Then we came home and realized they only gave us 6. We called them they never called back. I plan on calling my Amex. It's the principle on this. Bad business and bad ethics"}
{"text":"Wow! We wanted a place for Sunday Brunch that also offered bottomless drinks besides the standard champagne or mimosa. For an extra $15 each we had our choice of sangria, mimosas or pomegranate bellinis. Our waitress was wonderful and we certainly got our money's worth as our glasses were never empty.

The Buffet food ($35) was delicious too! There were several stations located throughout the main dining area. They included salads/appetizers, a carving station, kid's station and the dessert table. Entrees were lined up right next to the open kitchen and included Chicken Parm, meatballs, French Toast, scrambled eggs and a carbonara mac & cheese. Be sure not to miss the traditional mac & cheese at the kid's table which was the best we've ever tasted!! Also, get your protein fix with the delicious carved ham and chicken sausage. 

The dessert table is, of course, not to be missed! We saw a line a mile long across the way at Carlos' Bakery on our way in and were looking forward to being able to sample some of those offerings. The cannolis and the bread pudding with fresh whipped cream and caramel sauce were the highlights at the Buffet. They also had big jars of bite-sized wrapped candy which made for a nice little treat later in our room at The Palazzo. Parking was a pain since Venetian/Palazzo are two of the last on the Strip who do not charge but Buddy's Sunday Brunch will definitely be on our repeat list for our next trip!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! I ordered off the kids menu, Alfredo and mushrooms with chicken parm. OMG I didn't even eat half, SO RICH."}
{"text":"Best meal we have had in Vegas! Everything was amazing! The meatballs were incredible and oh that sauce. We loved the manager Stuart! He really made sure we were taken care of the whole evening. I would highly recommend! Great food and even better service. Thanks Stuart for making us feel like family!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Our server, Chaz was spot on. The water and bread guys were always there. Oh and the decor is fabulous. Split your meal. The portions are way too big. We ate off our veal chop for 2 days once we brought it home."}
{"text":"Great food and the staff is always helpful in feeding to your tastes. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences in Vegas. The food, drinks, service & atmosphere was amazing! I'm recommending this place to everyone! We arrived 10mins before closing and were beyond pleased with the service & accommodations. I'm coming back every time! And won't stop raving about this place!"}
{"text":"I was craving Italian food and stumbled upon this place when walking around in The Venetian.  This is Buddy Valastro's (celebrity chef from Cake Boss) restaurant, so I figured it has to be good and it did live up to my expectations.  I ordered the Chicken parmesan and spaghetti. It's oven-baked, provolone, and mozzarella.  It was crispy and with the perfect amount of cheese.  The spaghetti was with marinara sauce-$22
             
My wife ordered Lasagna Al Forno, which apparently is what they're known for.  The lasagna contains italian sausage, beef, pork ricotta and baked cheese on top. My wife was a fan.  It was $22.

The portion was big enough to share, which we should have done, since we had food coma shortly after. The customer service was great and our server was attentive.  I just think the food is pricey for Italian food and it didn't even contain any seafood, but then again anytime you have a celebrity chef attached to the restaurant's name then expect to pay more, so excuse my rant."}
{"text":"One word. AMAZINGGGG!!!! Definitely a 5 star restaurant. I came here because I love Cake Boss. I knew it wouldn't be a disappointment at all. My friends and I ordered: chicken parm, mother in law shrimp scampi, salmon, orecchiette & Italian sausage and a margarita pizza. All were on point! I'm def coming here again"}
{"text":"Nice looking place, nice staff, but the food.....the food was tasteless. Meatball sub had no seasoning and the fries were just....fries. my wife had the pizza and it was just bland and subpar. I asked for a Coke and the waiter brought me a cherry coke. I asked him for a Coke again  and he brought me what tasted like a mix between Dr Pepper and cherry coke. My went on to try the canoles, and they tasted like chalk.  We were really disappointed. We were rooting for the \"cake boss\", but he just didn't deliver."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good! Their birthday cake was totally awesome. The busboy Victor M was more helpful than our waiter! The hostesses are rude, nasty & lazy! They were so busy talking about what they were going to do that night that they actually got upset with the people in my party for interrupting their plan making! Put these girls in the kitchen to wash dishes where they belong! Get some one better out front please!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service!!  The food was excellent. My daughter even asked for something not on the menu and hers was amazing. The wine options were excellent. Would liked to see a gnocchi option on the menu. We skipped the dessert because we were too full."}
{"text":"I didn't have my phone with me last night. Forgot to check-in. Bf & I wanted to go to Trattoria but it was closed because they were expanding. So we ended coming here. And it turns out that it was Buddy's place! Cake boss!!! Awesome!! Wait time was an hour, we put our name down and went shopping around to kill time. We got sitted in front of the kitchen. It was awesome to see the cooks say \"yes chef!\" Decoration had whisk, bundt pans, and rolling pins hanging off the ceilings. Cool! Yelpers said the portions are big so bf and I decided to share. No splitting fee. We got the calamari and chicken Parm. The focaccia bread was warm, soft, and perfect. The dipping was olive oil & balsamic vinegar. It was well balanced. Our order was taking soo long. Then our waiter came back with the wrong order for our appetizer. He was so confused. We were confused. He goes back to the kitchen and we hear the head chef get angry and started to yell at the waiter. The manager comes to our table apologize and pays for our appetizer. Great service!! Finally our appetizer arrived! Our calamari was perfect. Lightly battered, soft, and the sauce was great! It wasn't chewy! I hate chewy calamari! Our entree chicken parm was perfect as well. Well seasoned, lightly battered, juicy, thin, and huge!! No room for dessert this time.Next time we will come back and try the dessert too!"}
{"text":"Great experience and amazing service...

Here's a legit spot to get Italian food on the strip of Vegas. Had a plentiful selection of dishes ranging from pasta to pizza to seafood/meat. Overall cost for the dishes were sorta pricey... However, we're in Vegas so the whole situation is justified 

Here's we're we got:

Focaccia Bread 5/5- So bomb ! I wanted to eat the four or five more rolls but we had so much food. Dipped this in oil/balsamic and it's like heaven.

Calamari Fritti 5/5 - so delicious! The breading was perfection. Not too dense and not too salty. The perfect blend. I would highly recommend it!

Grandma's Meatballs 3/5 - they aight. Personally, didn't think it was anything special.  I feel like I make better balls myself . 

Dad's Bucatini Carbonara 4/5 - This dish was very rich and creamy. I was in the mood for something like this so I knew what to expect.  I was very pleased with the taste and how it turned out. There was a nice crunch from the pancetta. But beware, this might be the creamiest dish on the menu. The sauce was so nice and think that I felt like my stomach was putting on a warm blanket to keep my belly warm.

Mother and Law's Shrimp Scampi with Linguine 4/5  - here's a nice size plate with good size shrimp. Scampi sauce was buttery and rich and worked with the pasta.

Veal Marsala 4/5 - Strong plate with a very nice protein.  Marsala sauce was very good with a strong red wine taste. Veal was super tender and tasty.

Caramelized Sea Scallop 4/5 - Very good dish. 6 small sea scallops and everything was very tasty. Crispy prosciutto and parmesan polenta was on point. Only negative was that the dish might be good for someone with a smaller appetite. You definitely get more bang for the buck on a pasta dish.

Lisa V's Linguine and Clams 4/5 - Another great dish. Sauce was tasty, clams were fresh, good size. Can't really screw up a clam linguine unless you really try.

Overall, solid place to eat and great service. Great for taking a date. Didn't get any dessert because we were so full. But I'll be getting that next time!

{"text":"While we waited 30 minutes for a table (we did not have a reservation) it was well worth the wait. The two of us split everything - meatball appetizer (to die for), ice cold crisp Caesar salad, and Chicken Penne a la Vodka, and Buddy's Lobster Tail for dessert. Our waitress pointed us in the right direction from start to finish. Oh! And they served this warm cheesy bread - awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, prices are very reasonable if your not looking to spend a lot of money, and the food is spectacular. My wife and I got the ravioli, I took a few bites Bc I'm not a huge ravioli person but it tasted very fresh, and my wife loved it. I got the classic cheese pizza but added spinach and mushroom to it, it was the best pizza I have ever had, my mouth is currently watering thinking about it. Also the calamari here is a must, it's the second best calamari (behind Mastro's I have ever had). If you go between 3-5 u can get the pizza and the calamari off the happy hour menu for 20 bucks. Best 20 bucks you'll ever spend, unless ofcorse you put 20 bucks on a number in roulette and you hit ."}
{"text":"Loved the food. The portion sizes are very large. We had to split. The staff were super friendly. I could eat here again"}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing to write home about. We sat down and drink order was taken right away. Two min later a different person gave us the drink list and tried to take our drink order. Two min after that a 3rd person did the same thing. Portions were VERY small but taste was good. Service was terrible! They seriously took our plates away as we were still eating--like fork in hand headed toward the mouth and they take the plate away. We went for lunch and the restaurant was very empty so this type of rushed service was unnecessary! Probably will never go back."}
{"text":"Great dinner. We ordered Panzanella Salad, Chicken Piccata and Tiramisu.

This is the best pasta I have had in terms of flavor. It was just perfect. The salad was a bit on the salty side for us, but it got compensated by the Tiramisu.

Do recommend and make reservations. We didn't and had to side outside, which isn't too bad, but sitting in would definitely have been much much better!

It is on the pricey side as expected from a restaurant located in Venetian."}
{"text":"Spur of the moment choice but well worth it. Entertainment was good & food was excellent. Nice happy hour special & the garlic bread was terrific"}
{"text":"I must say, I ate one of the best Italian dishes in my life at bobby's V last night. From the moment you walk in service is great. Had a great view of the last Vegas strip. One good thing was that they didn't have any dress code which was important because i sure didn't feel like dressing up and walk a casino with heels on. 
 
There was live music performed by 2 incredible guys. The singer song need amazing and very classy.  Now back to the food. To start of I had grilled octopus and cheesy garlic bread. I was a bit skeptical about the octopus but it was really good. After that I had the mamas linguine and shrimp pasta. I ate a lot more that I'm reviewing. All I must say is if you come to Vegas and your in the mood for some home made Italian food come to this place."}
{"text":"The lasagna is simply delicious, chicken parm as well.  Chicken Caesar is ok. Some stuff is overpriced overall kids had good experience and enjoyed their food. Service is great they are on top of things"}
{"text":"This place was ok, but nothing out of this world.  We wanted to try his pastries and have a drink. The line was super long so we sat at the cake boss restaurant to save time since they sell the same pastries in both. We had two pastries and a drink and water and the bill was $41dll I don't mind the price if it's good, but this was just ok, average. if you ask me its terribly over priced :( maybe my expectations were to high and that's why I seem harsh Lol. Save your self some money and just make the huge line for his bakery and don't waste your time and money at the restaurant. Line is about 20 minutes long. Service was terrible,  the waiter took forever to take our order and after he did  he took even longer to bring the drinks out, we just paid for the bells and whistles, which soumded more like beeps and toots, Lol"}
{"text":"Mike was our busser...nuff said...that's how good the service was, we remembered his name!

Ah yes...the chicken parm was off the chain!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner reservations and arrived 30 minutes early. We requested a window table and were immediately seated. The table had a great view overlooking Las Vegas Blvd. 
Service was prompt and friendly. 
The meal started with a basket of bread along with Olive Oil and Balsamic. 
In support of Restaurant Week we ordered off the special menu.

The Caprese Salad was perfect. Nice variety of heirloom tomatoes, silky burrata, and the green beans was an interesting addition

The entrée of Spaghetti Bolognese was just the right size. The meat was very tasty and the sauce flavorful.

Dessert was Zeppole coated with spiced sugar and served with a raspberry dipping sauce. A great finish

Thanks Buddy V for your support of Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"I can't say anything bad about the delicious restaurant. You smell the del ious home cooking as soon as you get close to this restaurant . My husband ordered a ceasar salad and the croutons were crisp but baked soft on the inside. I swear those croutons changed his life! I had to try one for myself and it was different and delicious. I ordered the lasagna and grammas meatballs. The meatballs and tomato basil soup was so good. I could barely get started on my lasagna but the few bites I did take were Devine. I had to get a go go bowl. X since I didn't have a microwave to eat it later, I put it in my room fridge until it was time for me to go then I carefully wrapped and packed it and brought it home to Houston. I enjoyed it at home."}
{"text":"A more casual spot with a fun atmosphere that had some pretty good Italian food. I ordered the linguine with clams and sort of wished I would have gone with the shrimp scampi after I did it. My pasta was good, but the sauce was really brothy and most of it sat at the bottom of my dish, leaving less flavor to the pasta than I would have liked. The wait staff here is nice and attentive and the prices are reasonable, given the location."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Not what I was hoping for. This was my very first experience at a celebrity chef restaurant. I had high hopes. The atmosphere was nice, homey touches here and there, nicely decorated, and cute touches like whisks for the light figures. My disappointment was with the food. I ordered the chicken Marsala on the advice of our server.  Unfortunately, my chicken was not properly trimmed, and had a large strip of fat on both pieces. In addition, the chicken was overcooked and chewy. (A patron at the next table had chicken rigatoni, and felt his chicken was overcooked as well). It seemed like the chicken breasts had been cooked earlier in the day and then reheated. The Marsala sauce did not have the sweet flavor you usually taste with Marsala, and tasted more like a simple brown sauce with very little flavor. The side pasta that came with the Marsala was well cooked, well seasoned, and quite tasty. My husband ordered the lasagne, as it was a \"specialty\" according to the server. The lasagne was fine, although not really any better than other Italian restaurants I have tried. It is heavy on the veal, and heavily seasoned with anise.  If you really like anise, it's definitely the lasagne for you. We ordered the famous lobster tail for dessert.  It was a very small portion for the price ($9 for a piece the size of a very small pear) and did not taste fresh. The cream filling was very good, but the pastry was very chewy and even hard to cut through.  On the plus side, the service was very good, and the focaccia before dinner was also very good.  I was just disappointed that the food was not better quality for the price."}
{"text":"We had a reservation there a few weeks ago and were seated right away.  Service was attentive -at first. We got our drinks, went straight to the entrée. After that, our server wasn't very present. The chicken Marsala was pretty good; however, the pasta carbonara was very rich. My friend ordered it and I felt overwhelmed after two bites. Dessert was wonderful -we got the lobster tail and it was decadent. Great flavor and texture. The pit of night was when our waitress, Kacey, dropped the bill and told us the gratuity was already added so all we had to do was pay the total noted at the bottom. 
  The problem there was that we were a party of 3. We looked at the bill and printed directly on there was something along the lines of:
\"No gratuity has been added to your bill. For your convenience, here are some preset gratuity amounts, just circle the one you'd like to apply.
- 15%
- 18%
- 20%
- 22%\"

Kacey had circled the 20% option and wrote the new total at the bottom because I guess she thought that that was what she deserved. After she dropped the bill, we noticed she was constantly circling our table, waiting for us to provide a method of payment. We were a party of 3 and even though we are young (early 20s) we know how to tip. It was pretty insulting. I get it, you work in the heart of Vegas where many international visitors aren't aware of the customs. But that doesn't mean assume everybody is like that. After talking it over amongst ourselves, I got her attention and pointed out what the receipt stated and said that if it says that, then the gratuity amount should really be up to our discretion. She tried to cover it all up by saying something like, \"Oh, that was just a suggested amount, if it's that big of a deal I can just take it off.\" And she ripped off the bottom of the check. 
  I've worked in the restaurant industry and servers face heavy disciplinary action for that type of behavior. We still left a tip but the whole ordeal really just left a bad taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting Buddy V's.  The first time I came was about a year ago with several other couples on an adult trip.  We celebrated a friend's birthday and we had the most amazing experience and an extremely attentive waiter.  Our waiter completely took care of us with a flat rate per person and an unending amount of food, all of which was incredible.  We enjoyed it so much that we've been planning for the past year to come back and bring our children so they could experience it for themselves.

On Friday evening, April 7, 2017, we had the opportunity to bring our children, however the experience fell short of what we'd been long anticipating.  In town for a volleyball tournament, our first Vegas dinner was at Buddy V's.  We had a party of 8 and were celebrating birthdays for two of the girls in the group.  Upon initially sitting down at the table, I placed my purse on the back of the chair, as I do in every restaurant.  I pulled the chair out to sit down and as I sat, I fell completely on the floor as the chair had tipped over.  My purse is not THAT heavy, but rather the chairs are incredibly lightweight and not durable.  The waiter attempted to help me up but made no offer to get me ice or to notify management.  He did ask if I was okay, but due to the embarrassment and humiliation of falling down in front of other patrons, I quickly said yes, even though my elbow was hurting.  Leaving the restaurant that night my right elbow hurt.  Saturday morning I noticed my right elbow was bruised in addition to another bruise on the back of my left arm.

With regard to the meal, my daughters ordered off the Dinner Prix Fixe menu where you get a salad, an entree, and a dessert for $40.  The girls split their meal.  When the bill came, our girls had been charged for each item they ordered according to the a la carte menu pricing, instead of the Dinner Prix Fixe menu and it was added to the other party's ticket instead of our own.  The waiter also expressed displeasure with having to split the bill for the table into two separate tickets, which should not have been shared with us.

We asked the waiter toward the end of the meal if they could sing to the girls for their birthdays and he notified us that they don't sing.  He offered instead to bring each of the girls a birthday cannoli.  What he failed to mention, however is that there would be an additional charge.  I would not have minded had he mentioned that before bringing the desserts out but rather I discovered the additional charge when I got my bill.

Feeling dissatisfied with our overall experience, I decided on Saturday evening to write this Yelp review but wanted in all fairness to first call the restaurant and speak with the General Manager to let her know of our experience.  I called at approximately 6:30--not the most ideal time to call, which I acknowledged but I felt it needed to be addressed before anymore time had passed.  She told me that anytime a customer falls in the restaurant, she is to be notified.  She mentioned she was there on Friday evening when I fell and no one made mention of my fall to her.  She asked for my email address and told me that the next time we were in Vegas just to email her and she would take care of everything.  It is now Sunday at 11:15 a.m. and I've not received an email or phone call from her.

Incredibly disappointing, especially with all the hype I've given to Buddy V's in anticipation of this trip.  We will be looking for a new location for Italian cuisine on future visits to Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some dessert and an after dinner drink with a large group. I liked what I had but take issue with the fact that he has an Italian spot in Vegas. I mean, come on, you are known for a crappy TV show that has an emphasis on desserts and you \"film\" in Hoboken. I dont care if your grandmother cooked Italian...mine did too.

This place features fo-talian food with a of Carabbas feel. Hmmmm, I wonder where you got the idea? 

In their defence though, their lobster tail pastry was delicious. Everything else was underwhelming. 

Will I be back? NO. Im tired of all these wannabe TV culinarians."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I have had, we order the grilled garlic bread that we so moist and cheesy makes me want more just thinking about, the shrimp scampi that was awesome as well, the chicken parm was probably the best could not taste the fried taste which is great, and the carbonara that was great as well. We also tried there itailian beer is was smooth and had a great taste we also got to keep the cup another plus."}
{"text":"Came here after watching a show expecting something wonderful considering the prices.
Came on a Wednesday night expecting a wonderful experience considering this is Buddy's rest. Who we have loved for many years on TV. The service was slow and not up to what we usually get at a good resturant. As far as the food. It was good not great. SORRY BUDDY.
But we won't be coming back to your resturant."}
{"text":"We visited the  restaurant during brunch buffet. This was s great way to sample what a variety of the menu without ordering everything at once. It's fair to say the food was good but the desserts were amazing. I ate 3 cannolis. 
After getting extremely full we walked across the way to the bakery called Carlos Bakery. This is just the retail bakery side of the Buddy V. I am not sure what the deal is but there is always a line down the hallway with stantions. The wait was 45 minutes. You get up to the pastries and wait another 15 minutes to get your name called to pay. It a bit insane to have only 2 cashiers that can ring you up and keep this line control thing going. The people who put the pastries into a box and out your name on it then stand around to get rung up is inefficient."}
{"text":"Our experience at Buddy V's is always fantastic.  I had brunch there this past weekend and had such a great time.  The buffet style brunch has everything from eggs to chicken parmesan and it is all delicious.  They also have a bottomless drink package that includes beer, wine, mimosas, bellinis, sangria, and bloody marys for $16 which is such a steal.  

Our server was Charlie and we couldn't have asked for a better person.  He was funny, attentive, knowledgeable, and helpful.  In the few times that I have been to Buddy V's I have not had better service than I did with Charlie.  We will definitely be asking to sit in his section next time we come back."}
{"text":"You were so looking forward to a celebration meal at this restaurant. This was our destination restaurant for our special trip. When I made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. I stated we were celebrating a birthday and a graduation. When we arrived they acknowledged the celebration at the hostess stand. That was the last time it was mentioned. Not one of our servers recognized the occasion. It was less than impressive. The food was good. We had meatballs and spaghetti, chicken parmesan, and Mediterranean Sea Bass. My sea bass was tasty and came with a nice side salad. The food was all good but I wouldn't consider it excellent. A huge disappointment was being charged $10 for a glass of tea. The food prices were reasonable and what I would expect but I could have had a glass of wine for that price and it wasn't listed on the menu. Being gouged for iced tea is insulting. Next time I would pick a different restaurant in Las Vegas for a celebration."}
{"text":"I went here on our last trip to Vegas. It was convenient because we were staying at the Venetian. The food was amazing!! So yum. I got the ravioli and it was amazing! I was trying to save some for later that night but ended up eating it all! I definitely want to go back and try the other meals. The only downside was the waiter wasn't as nice, a little rude."}
{"text":"Finally made it to my 200th review!!  I decided to use this special spot for a review on one of the best plates of spaghetti I've ever had, EVER! Hubby and I had been excited to visit Buddy V's since the construction announcement. We are big fans of Buddy's so we were curious to see what his restaurant would have to offer. 

This restaurant is located in the Grand Canal Shops. I'll give you a shortcut - if you enter from the side Walgreens is on, just go upstairs and you'll see the signage. Go in through the glass doors for the shops area and you're there. No need to go through the entire casino. His bakery is right across the hall. 

Hubby and I decided beforehand that we were going to split the Chicken Parmesan and split a Lobster Tail for dessert. We got a great seat over by the window in the main dining area. The entire restaurant is decorated really cute, and I loved the family photos. Service was attentive but only by our waiter's helper - our waiter took our order then went missing until time for the check. The assistant was great, he deserved all of the tip but I doubt it ended up that way. 

Chicken Parmesan was huge, definitely big enough to share. We each got a chicken breast and a large portion of spaghetti so I'm glad we split it. The spaghetti sauce was amazing, I'm still dreaming about it. Noodles were cooked perfectly. Chicken was cooked nicely, no complaints about the meal at all. Our Lobster Tail was a little hard though, like it was either over cooked or a few days old. Not flakey in a good way, more like shards of hard bread. And the pastry cream tasted like whipped cream, not what I was expecting for the price. We'll definitely be back but only for the Chicken Parm. Might try a different dessert next time."}
{"text":"The service are terrible, I ask a bigger table because I wanna more space and the restaurant are almost empty at Monday 15:40 P.M and the attendant say no because it's for big families. The margherita pizza it's the opposite of the real one, the waiter dropped water on the table, water I don't ask for. They bring the tap before I ask a desert, totally rude, bad bad service."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Buddy Vs with a group of 8 and it was amazing!!!!! We did the Imperial family style tasting... I think that's what it was called. They brought out a tasting of all their specialty items from start to \"sweet\" finish and it was unbelievable!!!!! Now to the best part which is hard to almost impossible to find in Vegas.. SERVICE!!!!!! Our waiter Giorgio was probably the most incredible waiter I have EVER encountered in all my 40 years of dining 3 to 5 times a week. Astounding and personable, funny stories were shared between him and all my clients and he single handedly made the night... one of my potential clients enjoyed the evening so much he whispered on the way out that anybody that has great taste in dining establishments like Buddy Vs is someone he can see himself in business with.. THANKS GIORGIO!!!!!!!! See you next time in Vegas for sure!! A must visit!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Casual restaurant that's great for family or date night. Quick service with a friendly smile and small talk. Had the lasagna it was huge and delicious. The shrimp scampi has large fresh shrimp. Sauce was just right and not too heavy. Also tried the scallops they were delicious except they were small. But the dish was overall filling."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their chicken parmesan is unbelievable!  It is a great environment and fun place to go.  For desert the lobster tail pastry is a must and is definetly enough for a few people.  So good!!"}
{"text":"As good as American Italian type food as you can get. Spaghetti and meatballs were home-made tasting, in my book that means you can taste the true tomato flavor and it is not overwhelmed by the many spices normally found in spaghetti sauces. 5 medium size meatballs complement the pasta in a heavenly smelling and tasting treat. Garlic bread was buttery, crispy, garlicky, and substantial. Calamari crispy, peppery, with lots of tentacles. This is how calamari should be.

Wait staff amazing, in my book. I had technical questions about the tomato sauce, as in how their Bolognese is prepared. Suffice it to say, it tasted great...not too infused with basil and oregano. Polite and courteous, all staff were pleasant and kind.

The breadsticks were wrapped in separate packages. Just ask for more if you want more. Real grissini torinesi, as they are long and thin, with a hint of olive oil taste.

As good as it gets now...if you've read my reviews, I only give 5 stars to any place only after it has consistently shown, after many visits, that their quality and commitment never wavers."}
{"text":"The orzo, the chicken Parm and the cheesecake. Enough said! 

I brought a large party here, and it was rave reviews all around. The atmosphere is causal, but delivers on home cooked style goodness that pleases the masses. 

I would definitely go back, and I would definitely bring people here again!"}
{"text":"Buddy designed a restaurant that made you feel like you were having a meal in his family kitchen.  Service was incredible and the meal didn't disappoint.  Chicken parm, meatballs, and meat/cheese board were all awesome! Atmosphere and attention to decorative detail was impressive.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I am a Las Vegas local who is originally from New Jersey and boy was I impressed. I did not even care for any of the pastries at Carlo's Bakery back in Hoboken, but we wanted to try a little taste of Jersey in Sin City. 

The Sunday Gravy (have no fear, you can get this every day) reminded me of those many Sunday dinners back in NY/NJ that started at 2 and ended around midnight. It almost brought a tear to my eye eating that food because it tasted so much like what my grandparents would make for us. Those grand meals are unfortunately a thing of the past, but Buddy V's brought it back to life. The meats in the Sunday Gravy were perfect, the pork was so tender, and you can taste the flavor in every bite of the sausage and meatballs. It was quite a feast and a pretty good value considering that you are right on the Strip. My wife had the lasagne and it was massive. The service was excellent, attentive, but not overly. 

Buddy, your pastry shop may not be great, but your Italian restaurant is. Great job! Thank you for bringing a taste of New Jersey to Nevada. The location is tricky, it is on the side of the Venetian between the Palazzo, but once you make it there, you will be back."}
{"text":"So glad we were able to experience this restaurant! I ordered the carbonara with wheat pasta, and my fiancé ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Both were delicious. Spaghetti sauce was very fresh with ripe tomatoes. My dish was flavorful and not too heavy for a cream-based sauce. The complimentary bread was also tasty. We did not try the dessert here, but wish we had because Carlo's Bakery across the way was a disappointment compared to this restaurant. Next time, we will order dessert here and see if it's better than the quick stop place."}
{"text":"My mother and I came here the evening of 12-12-2017.  The one star is not for the food - the food is wonderful and worth the trip.  The one star is for the service.  Although at first 'Caleb H' (from the receipt) was pleasant, his follow-up service and care was horrible.  I watched him as he checked on the other tables - he did not come back to us after taking our orders at all.  Although dinner was around 8:00 PM, it was not too busy (considering it was a weekday too).  He even passed by us twice without saying a word.  When I looked at the other servers around us, they checked up on their customers at least three times.  I wonder if it was because I mentioned we had a coupon from booking a stay at The Palazzo?  Did he treat us differently thinking we were cheap?  I wonder if it could be something else?  I mean, we spoke English, so it could not have been because we were Asian.  I wonder at times though.  Every other restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas had servers who were attentive enough to check back with me/us at least once.  

At least Mourad was kind enough to make sure my mother and I had everything we needed during our meal there.  He apologized, but there was no need.  I also voiced my concerns with the on-duty manager.  If the server does not want to serve me/us, at least send us someone who will.  Mourad and the on-duty manager were kind and listened to my complaint about the service.  Hopefully, 'Caleb H' will not disregard other patrons as he did us this evening - it was insulting.

Come here for the food - not the service by 'Caleb H.'  I should contact The Venetian/Palazzo to stop considering giving hotel guests a coupon to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Place is my go to when I'm out in Vegas. Their bottomless mimosas, bellinis, &  sangria are so delicious food is good. I wish they'd keep it hot. The food is like room temp to cool. But other then that I'd definitely recommend it to people"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic Happy Hour.  We tried a bunch of the small bites and got the Buddy V's pizza as well to truly experience the restaurant.  If you're coming for the Happy Hour you have to sit in the bar area but there's plenty of seats and it's very comfortable.  Great view of the strip can be seen from most seats, as well as TVs for watching the game.  

I began with a $4 house red wine and then ordered the sausage and pepper sliders, veggies and olives, calamari, gnocchi, and meatballs.   I would specifically say the calamari has a very nice texture to it and isn't too crispy.  In addition, the meatballs are simply outstanding.  The gnocchi is a bit weird as it's not the typical pasta variety, but instead a cubed pasta variety.  Still tasty, but not what I imagined when ordering.  The sliders were great and come 2 to an order.  And the olives and vegetables were a nice addition to any meal with crispy, tasty bread to add.  The pizza was actually very good as well with sausage and fresh cheese.  I had to get a pinot noir by the glass added to my order off the main menu to compliment the meal.  In total, I got out of a Las Vegas strip restaurant with all of that food and 2 drinks fro $60.  What an incredible deal.  This place is a must for Happy Hour (until 6:30pm) and I imagine their main dishes are just as good.  I had high hopes coming into Buddy V's given their association with the Honey Salt and Andiron team, but this Happy Hour and my experience overall was just phenomenal."}
{"text":"We made reservations for 9pm we ran a bit late but ended up nabbing a great booth facing the main street. The servers are prompt and polite, we had very delish bloody mary's (mine was virgin) really flavourful. My date had the chicken parm, he described it as cooked perfectly. I had mama's chicken holy smokes! Juicy and bursting with a medley of flavours. Loved the restaurant, a definite highlight. I look forward to the next trip."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cheese Ravioli and a side Caesar Salad. WOW! Definitely one of the best Caesar Salads I've ever had and the Cheese Ravioli was ridiculously amazing! My friend got a Salumi & Cheese board that was also amazing. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Vegas who wants a nice sit down meal at an upscale restaurant for average prices!"}
{"text":"I recently ate here when I was in town for my birthday, and I'm glad I did. From the start to the end, service was great. 
The food was delicious. I remember before arriving looking at all the pictures and how cheesy everything was, which our plates did not disappoint with the amount of cheese. The garlic bread we orders came with three large slices, more than enough to share. I ordered the shrimp scampi. The shrimp were large and juicy, yum! My fiancé ordered the chicken Parmesan and he really enjoyed it. 
Atmosphere and food were great, the price was fair for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Our service was excellent and the waiter was very nice. I ordered the calamari and the caprese. The calamari was good but also very salty. The caprese had great flavor and I loved how the bread was so perfectly cooked that it had a nice crunch, combined with the flavor of the cheese etc. it made a perfect flavor leaving you to eat all the others."}
{"text":"I would give more stars if I could... my family and I were in town for my cousins 21st b-day and we decided to eat here for dinner on night one. We had just arrived and hadn't eaten all day, so we were starving. They have skinny bread sticks in a cup on the middle of the table and we were so starving that we all shared them, I thought to myself I hope this isn't one of those restaurants that gives you tiny portions and these skinny bread sticks and charges an arm and a leg lol and than the bread came out. OMG!!! I was wrong and in complete heaven. I had the Lasagna (best I have ever tried) trust me I am a Lasagna expert! My fiance had the Chicken Parm (Best he and I have ever had) this place will NOT disappoint you. The service was excellent as well!!"}
{"text":"Buddy V's is one of, if not the closest you'll ever get to legitimate New Jersey dining. You get the plaid napkins, Torino breadsticks, a wide variety of Italian entrees and desserts. The desserts are from none other than Carlo's bake shop so you'll be in for a fine treat. I personally ordered the Sunday Gravy entree and it was one of the best Italian dishes I've had in awhile. It's tomato stew served with tender veal, homemade Italian sausage and meatballs served with rigatoni. Think of it as spaghetti with meatballs but more variety of meat for you meat lovers. A great experience overall!"}
{"text":"We were only here for the night.  We were staying on the strip, walking, and looking for something different to eat.  I've watched Buddy on T.V. and have been impressed with his portrayed personality anyways.  So when we saw the restaurant we decided to try it.  All of the tables with the view of the strip were taken so we decided to sit at the bar where my husband could watch the hockey game that was about to start.  Christian was our bartender.  She greeted us promptly, set us up with waters, offered suggestions, had a vast knowledge of the foods and drinks and patiently waited for us to make up our minds. They offer a decent selection of bourbons and whiskeys.  My husband loves a good old fashion.  Not only was Christian accomplished in making one she recommended the Elijah Craig and took it to another level.  She muddled the fruit and then strained it off which he always appreciates. Comes over square ice, nice presentation with orange rind and not one, not two, but 3 luxardo cherries.  We got there in time for happy hour, which ends at 6:30 or 7 p.m.   I had the sangria for $5.  You can't beat it.  Probably 1/2 cup of fresh fruit at the bottom.  It was refreshing and the wine was actually a decent one, which isn't always the case for sangrias.  There was another bartender working, Matthew.  They worked flawlessly together.  No one's drink without ice or is left with an unfilled glass.  Usually  you get the attention of 'your' server but here, they are attentive and make you feel like family.  Speaking of which, Matthew recently became the proud Pappa of a preemie which he is still visiting daily at the hospital.  Prayers for speedy growth and discharge home.  Thanks to these two our stay was wonderful and the food was completely overshadowed.  But allow me to address it.  We had the meatball sliders.  I found good.  My husband found wonderful.  The macaroni and cheese was very good.  And we had the lobster tail dessert.  Crispy croissant cooked perfectly with a french creme in the middle.  This is wonderful!  Don't forget afterwards to walk across to Carlo's and get some of their .."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service!!! Our food came out very quickly, and there was always a staff around to refill drinks and get other things for the table. Had the chicken parm and cannolis for dessert. Could not complain at all!"}
{"text":"Came here for their brunch buffet. The food is much better when it is ordered off the menu instead of a buffet. It's still good but it's not as good. For example, I love their chicken parm but it's soggy at the buffet. The croutons in their panzanella isn't warm and crispy like they usually are. However, it's a good way to try a lot of the items off their regular menu. Service is still good and $35 for a brunch buffet is super reasonable."}
{"text":"We had Thanksgiving dinner for four at Buddy V's Ristorante.  According to our internet search for top Las Vegas restaurants for Thanksgiving dinner 2015, Buddy V's was showing a delicious menu including a squash soup to start and a main plate, all for $28/person.  When we arrived, it was $10 for soup and $29 for the main plate.  They explained that somehow, it was the 2014 menu and pricing showing online.  The soup arrived and it was way too sweet.  It should have been served as dessert, not an appetizer.  I barely had three spoonfuls and when  they took it away, they didn't even ask if it was ok.  The main course arrived and it was tasty, but cold.  We sent it back and asked for it to be hot.  When the second plate arrived 10 minutes or so later, it was still cold.  We hoped that the third time would be a charm, but it wasn't.  Half the plate was hot, half was cold.  I'm sure they must have microwaved it.  The really scary thing was that half the turkey and sausage was gone, so I'm still wondering if they served me my plate or someone else's plate.  We spent over $250 for four with a $40 bottle of wine, before tip, and were tremendously disappointed with the service, and the fact that they're incapable of serving hot food, despite several attempts.  The flavor was good, but that is not sufficient to give them our business a second time."}
{"text":"We celebrated our daughter Victoria's  21st Birthday with family last night at Buddy's  and we loved it. We had a great server by the name of Peter who recommended family style dishes ( veal parm, chicken marsala, lasagna  & more that were just  amazing !  In addition , Peter and his team of helpers made sure everything was taken care and everyone was comfortable.  It was an amazing experience and I highly recommend Buddy's for your next special occasion . Ps- I ordered my daughters birthday cake from Carlo's Bakery across the hall from the restaurant and it was so delicious!"}
{"text":"Had chicken parmesan with garlic cheese toast. Both we good with generous portions. It's a good family Italian meal, at a 5 star price.  Great Italian restaurants that for the price maybe better choices."}
{"text":"We went for lunch without a reservation and sat at the bar. The chicken Parmesan was outstanding. Very fresh ingredients and fantastic iced tea. We really enjoyed it and had a view out to the strip."}
{"text":"Great for lunch. Hubby had meatball sandwich and diet Pepsi, I had the Hoboken cheesesteak sandwich and a Brooklyn summer ale. Both sandwiches came with fries, which they top with a little bit of shredded cheese. Hubby didn't want cheese on the sandwich or fries.... Orders came out perfect. Sandwiches are large enough to share. Service was a good. Water refilled often, free refills on soda. Cute decor. Would definitely return when visiting Vegas again. Thanks Buddy V for the real homemade Italian food!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to come because we heard this place was great for families with kids. That is an understatement! The restaurant is loud (due to awesome music playing) enough to drown out our very vocal toddler. 

But let's talk about the food I had the beef tenderloin and the wife had the grilled salmon. Both were close to perfect as can be. Meanwhile our son had the cheese pizza which was so good...I stole a slice. It's enough for two kids so I didn't feel bad. 

To cap off the amazing dinner we had the Nutella Cake...which was heavenly and we ate ever last bite. 

You got to come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Only place in The Venetian that disappointed . Felt like the Olive Garden.  Bread had no taste. Very stingy with the pasta. The waiters were nice and desserts were good. Loud and overpriced.  Even the $12 bloody Mary was bland."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour, it was great! Service was frendly! Will come back to try their dinner! We tried everything at the happy hour menu!!! They were all good!!"}
{"text":"Total waste of time and money.

They get a star for service - our waiter was quite personable and competent and the bartender made some tasty drinks. But that's where the praise ends. I ordered something simple: spaghetti and meatballs. It was very...ordinary. As in \"I've had better at my junior high school cafeteria.\" Absolutely nothing to praise about the dish. I make better at home. So does the wife. So does Chef Boyardee, for that matter.

The wife ordered the veal parmesan. It was a huge hunk of meat, on the bone, pounded way too thin and then burnt under the cheese. The cook obviously put it on too high a heat and forgot it for a bit. Totally inedible.

For a place opened by a \"cake boss,\" you'd think the desserts would be exemplary. Guess again. The rum birthday cake was so-so, and the cannelloni were stale and flavorless. Again, worthless food served in a nice room with good service.

Save your money and taste buds and go anywhere else for dinner. Maggiano's is just down the block and light years better tasting. Heck, go to Battista's. It's a dive that's over-rated and still better than Buddy V's. Or just stay home, heat a can of Chef Boyardee and eat it while tearing up $20 bills. In the end it's the same experience."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is fantastic! I googled best chicken Parm in Vegas and this place popped up... It did not disappoint. We got a great view from our table looking towards the strip. The bread they give before the meal is good. Our food came out in under 5 minutes. It was some of the best Italian food I've ever had. It didn't hurt our waitress was amazingly good looking as well. Overall great experience and I'll definitely be going back again. I think my favorite part is that it is underrated and not a lot of people know about the place."}
{"text":"Hands down, best Italian restaurant I've experienced. Italian food is my absolute favorite food and I have been to A LOT of Italian restaurants, but Buddy V's is by far the best. Everything about it was authentic...even our server! He was awesome! I had the Sunday Gravy. It's a pasta with sauce full of different meats. Everything about it was amazing. The Lamb was the best and most tender I've ever tried and the Italian sausage was amazing. The food was so delicious that we passed all of our plates around the table so everyone in our group could try each dish. The Mac and Cheese and lasagna are to die for as well! This is definitely a restaurant worth trying during your trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Popped on in on a Tuesday for lunch while walking the strip. Service was quick, the servers were happy to be there and very friendly. There is a variety of food and drinks to choose from. The calamari was good sized and delicious! I went with a party of 4. The main courses ordered came out timely and hot!

It was slightly on the pricey side though I'll not complain as the experience there was well worth it!"}
{"text":"His name speaks for its self the food is delicious the pasta is just to die for I've probably had almost every pasta and i can't say one is even bad. And the deserts are just as phenomenal. The price is great too i recommend all my clients to come here if they want amazing Italian affordable dinner."}
{"text":"Service was terrible!!!!!! I am in the restaurant business and I saw the busser more than my server. Caleb H checked on us probably about two times during my dinning experience. I ordered the chicken parm and was not even offered extra parm or fresh ground pepper. If you come to this location make sure you don't get served by Caleb H!!!!!! I am a server and I know what to expect for quality service. I felt like I was under served just because I was of the younger age group. Definitely not worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken parm I've ever had! Really good, comforting Italian food! Scallops were amazing, vodka sauce was amazing.  Really good food!"}
{"text":"Average Italian eatery. Laid back atmosphere, do not get dressed up here. There is not much to say - nothing really impressed us but nothing was disappointing either. Not a bad price for the strip. We had calamari, meatballs, and chicken parm. All are average."}
{"text":"This restaurant was stumbled upon because we wanted to find a great affordable restaurant that we could go to before going out for a bachelorette. This restaurant is located right in the Venetian hotel right across from Carlos's bakery. The restaurant was dimly lit inside. It's a great restaurant that has an amazing view of the north side of the strip. You just have to request it when making a reservation. It wasn't too crowded and for Vegas it is truly affordable! The dishes run between $15-30. They give you just the right amount. It's definitely not a family style Italian restaurant so I suggest not sharing. I had the chicken rigatoni which I made spicy and omgosh it was so good that I had every last bite and wanted to lick my plate up haha. It was amazing and this is definitely a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"We had an early dinner. Stopped in around 4:30 p.m. The restaurant is really nice, open and clean. There are great views. The portions are pretty big. I didn't care for the drinks. But other than that the menu is pretty simple and easy to follow. The prices aren't that bad for being a restaurant in Vegas. Definitely good for either a big family dinner or casual dining."}
{"text":"The smashed meatball sub was amazing and the rosemary seasoning on the fries was delicious. Loved the vibe in there too! 

I noticed that our server gave the table beside us different attention. He asked them if they had been there before and when they replied no, he gave them an intro speech of sorts, describing who Buddy is and how the restaurant came about. I was a little disappointed that he didn't bother sharing that with us. I'd suggest that it was because  we looked like tourists, but you know...they ARE located on the strip!

I will definitely go back for dessert. They looked phenomenal."}
{"text":"Valastro Sunday Gravy, I was NOT ready for you! When I read the ingredients listing for this dish I just didn't believe it. I honestly took it for a joke. It was no joke. Valastro Sunday Night gravy is one of those thick, rich and hearty Italian dishes that you imagine Sophia would be cooking for the Golden Girls on a cheesecake and ice cream night. So saucy and full of meat, meat,  meat!!! Veal, sausage, pork, meatballs and bones. Ohhh the lovely bones. I ditched the rigatoni for spaghetti and I was soooo satisfied. Shame on me for swooping down on the soft and super tasty basket of bread like a starved hawk. So much bread made for a crowded tummy but I couldn't help myself. Butter and olive oil for sopping weren't necessary. That's just how tasty the bread was. Dessert??? There was no room and no way. This ain't The Olive Garden. The chefs in Buddy V's ristorante were definitely paying attention to their Italian grannies in the kitchen. I'm sure of it."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner one night and I enjoyed a good service.

I wasn't really hungry when we walked in here as I just ate gelato not too long ago. So I just ordered scallop dinner.  It was cooked well but flavor was less, I think I was supposed to eat with bacon served with the dish for flavoring, but I put bacon aside and I think I wasn't supposed to do that to fully enjoy the dish.

They had good drink menu including variety of wine.  While the list wasn't extensive it was easy for me to spot what I liked.

Ambiance is really casual, for being casual restaurant, I thought it was a bit pricy. 

Service was great. He was professional with nice smile. The way he presented the desert menu to me, for a moment I thought I was at a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"Indulgent Italian fare that hit the spot for our family celebration feast! My sister got married in Vegas and we choose this place for our reception, so to speak, and had a fantastic time. The food was amazing with huge portions. The apps we all shared included the meatballs  (EXCELLENT! And I know my meatballs lol), calamari and the focaccia. Everything came out at the same time (bravo!) and we had wine chilling next to the head of the table.

The chicken parm was just like home and was so good after trying it someone else had to have it as well and changed their order. Definitely one of the best things on the menu. There's a great deal where for a set price you get an app, soup/salad, meal and dessert: WORTH IT. I enjoyed my carbonara pasta: SO much flavor. 

You could take home leftovers, but you'll just eat them at 4am without regret and it'll still taste good!"}
{"text":"The food was not bad here but definitely did not have that wow factor. Mostly just skip the spaghetti and meatballs, the meatballs were quite the let down :( the calamari is great and the shrimp scampi noodles were on point but the rest of our food (spaghetti and garlic bread appetizer) was just okay. Ambience is cute and servers were nice and on top of drink refills and checking on our table."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding !  My wife was given a complimentary glass of wine for what they called a delay. There was really no delay they were just on top of Service so much that they apologized up-and-down for the delay!  The veal chop was hot and tasty and the lobster tail was out of this world. My wife's veal Picata was outstanding as well will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the show cake boss four years, so I just had to go to buddy's restaurant  in Vegas! And it did not disappointe, food wss fantastic, great staff and  wonderful at Atmosphere!"}
{"text":"So, I'm not crazy about the whole celebrity chef thing. I have seen Cake Boss, but I didn't know they had branched out into regular Italian food. But my friend wanted Italian for dinner so we went to Buddy V's. She was excited about it. 

My absolute favorite, I order it wherever I go, Italian dish is eggplant parmesan. Somehow at Buddy's it is an appetizer, not an entrée. Luckily I asked the server and she was able to make it an entrée and add a side of pasta. I was nervous, not knowing what appetizer eggplant my look like, but it was delicious. It was layered slices of perfectly fried eggplant with a chunky tomato sauce and cheese. Honestly, I was half starving from walking all day, but I would say this is one of the best eggplant dishes I've ever had. I cleaned my plate. 

So, food was fantastic. Our server was pretty mediocre, but I was so happy with the eggplant I don't even care. They get 5 stars from me. I may have to give this celebrity chef more credit."}
{"text":"The food is full of flavor. We decided to eat here after reading a few Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. My husband had the Veal Marsala and I had the Chicken Parm. Both were delicious! We wish we would have split a dish though, because by the end of dinner we didn't have much room left for dessert, which look so dang good. Sad face. Next time we will definitely split a dish so that we can indulge in some yummy Italian dessert."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals of my entire life. Molto bene! I wish I had room after dinner for dessert. Lol. The staff are very friendly, helpful and professional. Make sure you make a reservation in advance. The only issue we had was the air conditioning was blasting so it was very uncomfortable. Bring a coat just in case!"}
{"text":"Chicken Parm, the bread....the grilled garlic bread....was the BEST I have EVER had. We never leave LV without a stop at Buddy's.  I have sat in an actual old Sicilian lady kitchen's after they have cooked ancient old family recipes for days and it doesn't compare. Yum Yum"}
{"text":"This review is for their Spring 2014 Restaurant Week Menu.

Can I tell you how much I enjoy this place? I don't watch \"Cake Boss,\" but I'm a fan of Buddy V's Ristorante. Its setting: rustic and contemporary with a homey ambiance that's reflected in its decor. The tall windows open up the space, providing view of Las Vegas Boulevard below. All right, enough of the interior design, on to the food!

Appetizer - Caesar Salad with Polenta Croutons, Parmesan, and Eggless Garlic Dressing: During Restaurant Week, I ate my share of Caesar salads from one restaurant to the next, and this one was the best because of the polenta croutons that were crunchy and soft at the same time. I wish I could eat this salad every day. 

Main Course - My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara with Pancetta, Cracked Black Pepper, and Egg: One word: Divine. Ok, maybe a few more descriptive terms like creamy, pleasing to the palate. I would lick the entire bowl if no one was looking. 

Dessert - Cannoli: Good, but not the best that I've had. It definitely packs a crunch and isn't too sweet as is, but there's always the option to sweeten it up further by dipping it into the chocolate sauce that it's paired with. 

Not on the Restaurant Week Menu. 

Appetizer - Garlic Bread: Topped with melted fontina and mozzarella cheeses. Makes a good, tasty starter. 

Dessert - Lobster Tail: Filled with buttercream and garnished with fresh berries. Pretty yum, though difficult to cut into. 

Service - Staff members were always aware of our table, never missing a beat.

Overall - This has quickly become a new Strip favorite of mine, and I'm already looking forward to my next meal here."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service from Kristi and Alex!

The Gravy is amazing with tons of flavors. And the chicken parm is the best I've ever had. Get a booth that over looks the strip and it's perfect to watch. Don't forget the calamari!"}
{"text":"I was seated at the bar during happy hour and i enjoyed it. Happy hour is from 430-630 and it includes beers, wine, sangria, and appetizers. I had some beer with calamari and riccotta cheese. They were excellent. Best calamari I've had in vegas. I also liked their cocktail hour music which was a plus. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING on January 6, 2018, Saturday, dinner around 6:00-6:30pm. I had the salmon (cooked) entree and shortly after the meal became lethargic and nauseous. Had a horrible night as symptoms progressed with fever and weakness until finally the poisoning passed around 2:00pm the next day. Stay away from this place, they are not handling their seafood properly and unfortunately most everyone going there is a tourist so they don't have to survive on repeat customers. But from my experience of getting very sick from eating the food here I would not recommend this place to anyone. In my opinion you're placing your health at risk."}
{"text":"Holy moly! This is the BEST food I have had in Vegas and we've been coming here at least 3x a year for the past 6 years. Shrimp scampi and chicken Parmesan along with caprese salad will keep us coming back for sure. Love the atmosphere and windows to the strip. Waiter was great and tiramisu delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to Buddy V's today. First let me start off by saying the hostess  tall thin looks like asian descent with ponytail who sat us was not very friendly. We asked to sit at a booth after finding the chairs too slippery and uncomfortable. When we asked to sit at booth it was like we bothered her. 

Once we got to sit down we were promptly served by a great busboy. Our waiter was Rocco.  He did a great job. We were talking and were not quite ready to make our order just yet but the rude hostess came over took all menus but one and said we could share? Does this place not have enough meñus? 

The food was ok. I got the angus burger on brioche and others got pasta items off the menu also said it was ok but not for price. Fries were not savory. It was just ok and overpriced. 

In the past I have tried the zappolis and wedding cake and they were phenomenal!!! But on this trip  I was just here for food. I wanted to give this place a better score but I was not happy with the limited selection, prices and the taste. 

Maybe just a bakery there would of been great."}
{"text":"Yummy food here! We ordered lasagna and chicken parmesan- two great choices! Large orders that we could not finish but definitely took it to go to experience it all over again the next day."}
{"text":"Solid Italian in the Venetian.  I had the fixed price deal with meatballs, bucatini and a cannoli.  Service was OK, food was quite good.  Setting was nice, noisy, but not too loud.  Prices were better than the average Strip restaurant.  I would go back."}
{"text":"What normally is a decent place really seems to have gone downhill with regard to the hostess group at the front.  They have no idea what they are doing.  Upon arriving at 10pm for a table of five, we were greeted with \"Is everyone here?\" ..Yes, we reply. 'Ok - they're setting it up\".....5-10 minutes later we ask what is going on and we're told \"It'll be 5-10 minutes\" not remembering what they said earlier.  We get to a table by the window and it's too breezy with the vents so we ask to be moved.  She says she can clean off the table next to us and we can move there.  

The waiter comes by later and says that's nonsense because that table JUST ORDERED!

So we ask again.  This time we're told we have table 38 in the corner...they just have to set it up (again).  We wait patiently.  When our group sees another group of five moving to table 38, it stuns me.  They of course get seated and I have to ask for the manager.  

She promptly comes by and asks all sorts of questions - and in the end comes back with \"Sorry for the confusion.  It's been really busy\".

REALLY?  ROCKET SCIENCE?  I think not.

With so many choices in Vegas, we will be going elsewhere from now on...don't need to be treated with incompetence from hostess to managerial level.

Good luck Buddy.  We even passed on dessert.  A shame really.....


**** UPDATE NOTE ****   Management did contact us directly and seemed truly concerned about the experience.  Very nice to know that they do care about what went on that evening."}
{"text":"If I was on death row and got to choose a meal it would definitely be Buddy V's at the Venetian in Las Vegas.
OMG this meal was absolutely AMAZING! No I did not count calories or point. We started at the bar awaiting our table with sangria's and an app of meatball sliders. (We could have stopped there... but no we continued)
At the table we chose to go for the cheesy toasted garlic bread and the price fix \"before show\" meal. Michael chose the meatballs for an app, the  Orecchiette & Italian Sausage as an entrée and for dessert the cannoli and I chose the Caesar salad, the chicken Parmesan and for dessert Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake with chocolate sauce and hazelnut praline crunch with salted caramel ice cream and a cappuccino too.
We could have been rolled out the door we were soooo stuffed, but we chose to walk up the Las Vegas strip back to our hotel to \"burn off some calories\". I will definitely need to hit the hotel gym in the AM to work off this dinner.
But it was worth every bite and calorie."}
{"text":"We had our company holiday party in their back room and everything was fabulous.  The manager, Christina was accommodating to all of our needs.  We had a group of 50 and everyone was raving about the food.  Chef Forgione greeted and thanked our employees for coming.  The food was incredible!! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am not going to lie, But this was by far the best experience that I have ever had at a resturant. We made a reservation in advance because we knew that it was a popular high demand place to eat. When we came to to the resturant we waited about 5 minutes so that while they got our table ready.  Once we were seated, we were instanlty greeted and served with drinks. Our Waiter was extremley nice! We informed them that we have people with food allergys and they took note to them.  Our waiter asked us what they were and took note (peaches, peanuts, onion, shell fish, and nuts where the allergains.) When it came time to order our food, he helped those with food allergeys first. Insuring that they order somthing that they can eat. He even made sure to check with the chef if it can make something without it in the dish. 

Everytime someone came out with food they asked who the people were with the allergey and told them wheather or not it is safe for them to eat it. One of the managers informed us that it would take a while for the food to come out since there are so many allergeys. All in all it took 50 minutes for our main entrees to come out and 30 minutes for the appitizers. The food not only looked amazing, but it tastes delicious.  We also had some cocktails, which were not only very strong (for those who like to drink with their meals :)) but they were very refreshing. 

Towards the end, we had informed our waiter that we have two people celebrating their birthday and he went to the back and brought them both out a canoli with a candle. 

This was by far the best experience that any of us could have asked for. I highly reccomend if you are looking for great italian food."}
{"text":"Went at 4:30 with some friends for the happy hour specials.  Service was sincere and friendly. The drink prices were killer for happy hour, and the food was great. I recommend the calamari, not to spicy, and the sauce is great."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this place.  The whole restaurant reminds me of classy establishment that will not scare you away from wearing jeans and a tshirt.  The food is Great and the service is excellent.  Our waitress yesterday was I believe Graciela and she did an excellent 5 star job !  Nuggs had the classic cheese pizza.. of course.. and although the presentation was nice the sauce tasted like it was straight from the can (in my opinion).  It did not compliment the pizza at all and I could only compare it to what would seem like Hunts canned tomato sauce accompanied with good pizza dough and cheese.  My friend had the Chicken Parm , and I had the Bucatini Carbonara which I hoped I spelled correctly.  Definitely NO complaints on those two dishes!  I would definitely try those if you are not sure what to get.  Cheesy Goodness accompanied with the subtle flavor of bacon and texture of what seemed to be bread crumbs in the Bucatini are going to have me coming back in July for a double order!  Super deliciousness! My only sadness is that for 23.00 nugget stole most of it from me and there wasn't enough for me.  It's a portion size designed for an average person I would imagine but being that I'm on the bit larger side of the spectrum I could have eaten two plates easily.  Chicken Parm with spaghetti was demolished by my friend so I would imagine that should tell you how good it was.  The Cheese board is also a good add to your list of things to get while you are here.  Great selection of meats and cheeses but the bread was not enough for the amount on the board.
Desserts I might have to say are phenomenal !  I would have to say a best choice would be the Nutella cake and ice cream.  I say this only because after our meal the nugget had finished most of her pizza and half of my pasta so when I asked her if she wanted a dessert she replied NO.  I received my nutella cake and after having one bite I asked her again .. Are you sure?  It's nutella cake.. and the result about dessert is in my picture for this place."}
{"text":"They did a nice job renovating the former First Food space. It feels more homey and approachable. The interior may skew towards an over-the-top, typical Italian restaurant  with red and white checkered tablecloths and a panoply of picture frames, but there are cool touches like the light fixtures and use of rolling pins throughout. The place doesn't reinvent the cuisine, but executes traditional Italian-American dishes with a few subtle modern touches to create one of the better Italian restaurants on the Strip.

The eggplant parm app has plenty of great flavor, but could have benefitted from a crispier exterior. The dough of the aggnolotti was a touch thick, but the crispy texture from being pan fried was a nice touch. The sweetness of the sauce with the savoriness o the pork filling was great. The winner of the night was the huge brick sized portion of lasagna that arrived in a small cast iron dish. The mixture of proteins along with the boldness of the ricotta made for a wonderful combination that was only enhanced by the depth of a red sauce that any Italian grandmother would be proud of. For little ones, there's a kid's menu available. Among the items was a large order of buttered noodles that my kid loved. No meal is complete without dessert, and the nutella cake was a satisfying way to end it. It's their version of a lava cake with a rich, moist cake enveloping a gooey nutella mixture. A scoop of salted caramel ice cream accompanied it with a brittle underneath that added a good contrast in texture.

The execution was solid and the dishes different enough from your typical Italian American joint to make Buddy V's a good choice among moderately priced restaurants on the Strip."}
{"text":"Came Here From California And Had To Stop By Carlos ' Bakery didn't even know that his restaurant was across the hall. only a 20 minute wait and they texted us when our table was ready which was very convenient.  

all the staff is great, very nice and always made sure our water was full ! everything on the menu looked great and our part ordered a little bit of everything. 

the pastas are really good and full of flavor.  of course we had to try desert since the line at the bakery was too long and with my lack of patience I just figured we could eat at the restaurant and order some desert . BAMM best of both worlds.  wrong not all the deserts are available at the restaurant, BUT there are some good ones on the desert menu.

the bathroom isn't in the restaurant, it's actually down the hall from the bakery across the hall, seems inconvenient but there wasn't a line any of the two times I went. 

Of course we had to try a canoli and of course we were not disappointed!  overall great restaurant with even better deserts."}
{"text":"If you want a fast food setting and to be in and out as quickly as possible...go to Buddy V's.  

Incredibly disappointing in that we hoped for a casual dining experience. Instead, we hadn't finished our salads and our entrees showed up!  As well, the server pulled my salad away and when I explained I wasn't done they acted \"surprised\" when I told them to leave it!  A person who may have been a manager, ( who knows....she didn't introduce herself)...apologized but instead of comping us anything ( like the salad I didn't enjoy anymore) she proceeded to ask if we wanted Parmesan cheese on my entree.  

AND as soon as we sat back from our incomplete entree, our check arrived!  Imagine the servers surprise when I told her I wanted another glass of wine.  She was put out because they would mean running our check again.

I don't think this is how The Cake Boss envisioned this. 

Save your money if you want a nice, un-hurried dining experience. We especially wanted this to be nice because it was the last night of our honeymoon.  Epic fail."}
{"text":"I ate here for Restaurant Week Spring 2014 and again the following night from their regular menu. The portions here are nice and the different types of dishes on the menu make it hard to decide what to order. Our server, Perry is fantastic! He checked on us often and made sure everything was to our liking. Managers, Adam and Christopher also stopped by our table at different times to introduce themselves and make sure we were enjoying everything. I could tell that not just the managers care about the experience of every customer, but the servers and rest of the employees do too.

The cost for the RW week dinner was $30.14 per person which I found to be a very fair price considering what I got. I had the following:

Buddy's Caprese

Chicken Parm & Spaghetti

Zeppole

The next day I at the following:

The meal started out with warm bread and oil and balsamic. Nice start!

Buddy's Caprese ($16) - This salad is sooooo good! It had charred green beans, burrata, tomatoes and balsamic. The variety of tomatoes and different colors of them were nice. The tomatoes tasted so fresh. The burrata was fantastic! So soft and tasted great. 

Buddy's Salumi and Cheese Board ($21) - Prosciutto, spicy capicola, genoa salami, gorgonzola, pecorino, grana padano, pickled veggies, olives and grilled bread arranged beautifully on a cheese board. The meats had such great flavor and the olives (they contain pits) had a nice garlic flavor to them. All the cheeses were good, but the gorgonzola was my favorite. It was creamy and easy to spread on the garlic toast. Delish!

Chicken Parm & Spaghetti ($23) - This is oven baked with provolone and mozzarella. I thought mine from the night before was soggy, so I asked that it be cooked longer this time and it was just perfect. Nice and crispy were is should be and the cheeses tasted good. The spaghetti on the side had marinara on it and parmesan and even though I barely had room, I couldn't let it go to waste! I did take half of my chicken parm home and it reheated nicely. 

Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake ($9) - The cake was warm and baked perfectly. It also came with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream that was excellent. 

Zeppole ($9) - These are served hot and coated in a spiced sugar. 2 dipping sauces accompany them, lemon raspberry jam and chocolate. The raspberry jam I wasn't crazy about, but the chocolate dipping sauce tasted great. 

They also have a kid's menu as well a lunch menu that offers burgers and sandwiches. I am eager to come back and check some of the sandwiches out. I was very pleased with the service, food and atmosphere. The first night, we sat at a table near the bar area next to a large window that overlooks the strip. The next night we sat at a booth that was closer to the kitchen. Both are different experiences so try them both! They also can host events here."}
{"text":"This restaurant was really good! We had never been here before and didn't really know what was on the menu other than knowing it was Italian food. Everyone was really friendly and service was fast.
We took our 8 month old and all the waiters and the hostess kept her entertained allowing us to enjoy bout lunch, the hostess even volunteer to rinse my baby's bottle when she dropped it!  Food was excellent and our waitress took time to explain the menu and make recommendations and we love the dishes she recommended. We will be definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This review is for the hostess. She turned me away with an elderly person and my 2 children. I could not get a table and order a drink. She said I had to order food and turned us away. My father in law has a few medical conditions I will not list but to be turned away is a joke. This place will never earn my business again!"}
{"text":"food was ok. customer service while at the rest was ok. after was bad. both my gf and i got diarrhea after. called back in the next day asked to talk to a manager, was transferred to christina (i think). she said that i was the first one to call in about the problem and would talk to the chef and call me back the next day. never got a response. so, feel free to try your luck at this table if u have been feeling lucky while your in vegas

2nd review
christina immediately called me after, was really nice and apologized for not calling me back immediately. i really appreciate their efforts in trying to fix everything and will definitely be back and try their food again!"}
{"text":"We eat at Buddy V's every time we are in Vegas. The food is generous and always delicious. Great wine selection and the cannoli's are divine."}
{"text":"5 stars for being the best meal in our week long trip to Vegas. A couple people in our party really wanted to eat here. I could care less thinking it was just a cash in on the cake boss thing. I was wrong. This place is legit. 
Food was great, service was pretty good, and prices not really bad if you compare them to other joints on the strip. I paid almost $20 for a terrible cheeseburger at the TI. I paid $24 for some of the most amazing chicken parmesan at Buddy Vs. I know which I'll be going back for next time. 
We started with the salumi and cheese board. Everything on the board tasted great. You really get a lot. We had a party of six and didn't eat all of it. I loved the pickled peppers that came with it. 
I had the chicken parmesan. Crispy breaded chicken with delicious marinara sauce covered in gooey cheese. So freaking good! It came with a side of spaghetti which I don't normally care for (don't shoot me), but theirs was really good. I just couldn't eat it all, and I'm a big guy. 
My wife had the chicken piccata. It was a big portion and delicious. Also served with pasta. 
We both loved this place and will most definitely be back! Next time we'll try to save some room for that awesome looking Nutella cake."}
{"text":"We had a really great experience at this restaurant. The food was great. Service was great and fast. Love the polenta croutons for the salad. Hope to eat here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge cake boss fans. We've visited the bakery multiple times, met buddy, and even ordered birthday cakes from Carlo's. He's such a nice guy, and his family is so genuine. 

Of course we had to try one of his newest additions. We showed up on a Friday right when they open, at 11:30a. We were seated pretty promptly. Our server was friendly, but not very authentic... Kinda 'going through the motions'. Too early to be at work I guess.

We ordered a pizza and a sausage and pasta dish. Both were very tasty and average sized, not huge but not small either. 

The decor is very authentic Italian, and has a homestyle kitchen vibe. Really spacious with tons of seating, only the weren't too many people dining , that day at least. 

I'll be back next time in in Vegas! I hope others will too!"}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 star place...
Had a team lunch here on a Friday and they do have a nice lunch special where $22 get you one of the three selected app/salad, an entrée, and a small dessert (tiramisu or cannoli).  I opted for the regular menu, lasagna, and a regular sized tiramisu.  As we were having lunch, we noticed our neighboring tables all got the 'birthday cake' for dessert so we also added that to our order.  It was good, but the tiramisu was still more delicious to me.  The waiter that attended to us seem to be in the weeds...

Overall, the food is decent but was a tad bit pricey for what it is worth."}
{"text":"Place is roomy, food is good. A bit overpriced but it's worth it. Kinda hard to find inside the hotel and casino. If you have someone that can't walk too much I wouldn't recommend it cause it might take a few minutes to find it inside all the Vegas chaos."}
{"text":"Took our workers for a nice dinner after a long day at the tradeshow.  Make sure you reserve this place as lines can get long and you may have to wait a while.  Service is attentive from start to finish.  Food is very good for commercial grade restaurant with a celebrity endorsement.  Live music was very entertaining, playing all the oldies with a drummer and a singer/pianist.  

Food wise, can't go wrong with anything you order here.  Everything is just fresh and piping hot.  Seafood is immaculate, meatball are succulent, desserts just melt your arteries and bread is bread.  Wine is expensive obviously but what do you expect.

I'd come back again to entertain guests or just grab a good italian food fit for a tradeshow attendee.  Their birthday cake is made out of diabetes so it's really good."}
{"text":"In LV for business and this was my attempt at branching out for dinner. The service was very good and we didn't wait for anything; drinks, bread, appetizers, refills. I ordered the calamari and it was ok. A bit too salty for my taste, but my dinner partner liked it well enough. He ordered the caprese salad and loved it. My other dinner partner ordered the meatballs and was gaga over them. I don't eat meat, so I couldn't taste it.  The wine choices were varied. We all got something we liked. Dinner was phenomenal. I had the shrimp scampi and I was bowled over. Crisp, flavorful, tasty pasta and 5 nice sized shrimps. I had plenty for breakfast the next day.  

Two of us ordered dessert. I had tiramisu and he had Nutella cake. I thought he'd lick the plate. I wasn't in love with the tiramisu, but the mason jar presentation was cute.

If you like pasta, give this place a go!

Side note: The live music was wonderful! The waiter kept pushing wine refills on my dinner partner after he says no more, emphatically."}
{"text":"We went here after checking out of the hotel for their weekend brunch. It was pretty darn good! There was such a variety of food, which all tasted great. I couldn't get enough of the meatballs and french toast. The decor is awesome. It feels like an old school Italian home. They had a live performer in there singing Frank and Dean songs. I thought it was the radio until my wife pointed out it was an actual guy. Awesome way to leave our very memorable trip!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars!! From start to finish it was the best experience in dining both my husband and I have ever had!! Arrived a bit early for our reservation and were greeted by two extremely friendly and gracious hostesses who said they were happy to seat us early!! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and very clean, looks brand new inside although it's a couple years old! We were seated in a lively bustling dining area. And a young man immediately, upon us sitting down, took our drink order and poured us water. Right after that Caleb (our waiter) arrived, wished us a happy anniversary and asked if we would like to move to a more private table with a special view..we agreed of course and within 2 minutes he had checked with the hostess stand and ushered us to the back of the restaurant where the bustling was at a minimum and sat us at a beautiful table looking out over the palazzo and the strip. Was already amazed at this point and we hadn't even ordered yet! Caleb then spent a few minutes chatting with us and made some recommendations, we ordered the recommended appetizer a crispy mozzarella bread in red sauce..OMG they brought it so fast and it was to die for...could have just eaten that for dinner. I had the 3 course special, chose Caesar salad(amazing), chicken parm(light and Delish..ate the whole thing) and the Nutella chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream(words can't describe how Devine) hubby ordered the bone in veal parm chop. He was in heaven!! Throughout the meal Caleb gave us just enough attention but was careful to give us space to enjoy our meal, the wait staff had our drinks filled any time they were half empty...never had to ask for a refill and even completely cleared and wiped down our table before bringing desert. I've dined at many 4 and 5 star establishments who could take a lesson in customer service and good food quality from Buddy V's. Thank you Caleb and the staff for a meal and experience 2nd to none, and for making our Anniversary dinner one we will never forget!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Thought I was going to have a mediocre lunch that was \"mall food\" but i was pleasantly surprised. Definitely a must if you are in the Venetian in las vegas"}
{"text":"Average food. Overpriced. Loud atmosphere. Service wasn't all that. Spend your money elsewhere even if you are a cake boss fan"}
{"text":"Please Save Your Money
Wife and I had dinner there on Friday night. Overall the entire experience was very very disappointing. The value for the dollar was not good. 
We had 2 drinks, 2 Apps, the caprase tomato's, laughable small  no taste at all. The potion size was the smallest I ever saw. The price was high even for the strip and it was tasteless. Wife had the tomato basil soup. Was only avg. 
I had had the spaghetti bolognese and wife had the regular red sauce. I don't know how Buddy can call himself Italian but the bolognese  sauce was totally tasteless. red sauce was just avg. 
Our male waiter upset us big time. Coming to Vegas 4 times a year I am or so I thought well schooled at efforts to run up the bill however.. We ordered drinks, apps etc and he says, oh do you want garlic bread at the table? Thinking it was an opening (welcome) dipping sauce and bread like most Italian restaurants, we say sure.
Well us and the table next to us made the same exact mistake. It comes and it is actually $13. charge. We both looked over and said, we just got taken! Shame on Buddy V's for this type of tactic to its guests. BEWARE..
Also, FYI, tables are very close to each other, private conversation is impossible. We heard everything the table next to us said and they were not loud at all. 
You need to understand that the value for the dollar you pay is NOT there.. 
Buddy V should just stick to what he does best, bake!! The open kitchen quickly reviled that there wasn't an Italian in the entire kitchen as it shows in the taste! 
There are much better choices on the strip. This is just another celeb chef guy trying to capitalize on the name.
If people stop going to these places to eat they will go out of business or start getting it right. 
For the life of me I cant figure out why there are positive reviews unless these are being gamed intentualy. 
By the way, a manager never came around to even ask us or the other table how everything was. Just another sign! We will never go back."}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant located in the Grand Canal Shoppes. I was craving spaghetti and meatballs and I was very pleased how good it was here.  The pasta was perfect and the sauce complimented so nicely I could have had it without the meatballs. But who am I kidding, those meatballs just took it up a notch! Definitely freshly made, juicy with all the right spices. I was so full that I had one meatball left and yes..I took that fist sized meatball in a doggy bag! No shame here. 

My kids enjoyed the oven baked Mac & Cheese gooey on the inside and crispy on the outside & the gourmet burger on freshly baked brioche bread with aioli and side of fries. Happy campers with full bellies! 

Of course being so full we had to take our cannoli to go. It looked so darn good that to my surprise tasted even better than I imagined. We ordered the chocolate chip and pistachio nut toppings. The cannoli stayed crispy/flaky even after eating it hours later. The cream and chocolate sauce was sheer perfection.  Definite must! 

A casual, hearty establishment for the entire family.  Bundt cake molds for wall decor as well as kitchen utensil inspired lighting and fixtures.  Booth seats overlook the Vegas strip. Since lunch was a hit, I would definitely come back here and check out their dinner menu."}
{"text":"5 stars for service... We got immediately seated. Initially we had intended to go to Carlos Bakery but the line wrapped around the corner, it had 3 different lines! So we decided to check out Buddy's restaurant instead and it was the best decision as we got to sit down. The restaurant is clean, large and well designed - it has elements of a modern Italian restaurant and they have pics of Buddy and his family on the dessert menu. We ordered the cannoli, tiramisu and large lobster tail. Since we ate lunch, we weren't hungry and thus didn't try the entrees. But the lobster tail dessert was worth 15$ and it can easily feed 4 people. The tiramisu was not good and the cannoli was sub par."}
{"text":"We are here tonight for my best friends birthday and from the moment the waiter spoke to our table we all felt that he had a HUGE chip on his shoulder. We then proceeded to wait 35 minutes with him never coming back after taking our order, no bread, no drinks. Finally we complained and the manager, who was beyond apologetic, nice and understanding came over and made sure the rest of our evening was great and it was. It was just disappointing to watch the original waiter serve other people in front of us like we were less important than the other parties. I work hard for my money and chose to spend it at this restaurant so it's disappointing when someone treats me like this. Hay being said the four stars instead of five was because of this. The waitress we were moved to was wonderful and lovely. I don't think I would go back but it was a great experience AFTER the first impression was made."}
{"text":"out of the world Italian food
servers were extremely nice and made you feel very comfortable
complimentary freshly baked focaccia bread with olive oil and vinegarette for dipping
(you may ask for more, they don't bite)

the lasagna was very cheesey (good thing) and you get a bit of everything in each and every bite

kid's meals were a good deal also especially their chicken parm

pizza was good but not my taste 

nice and dim atmosphere"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, attentive staff and pretty yummy and authentic food. Not too expensive given it's Vegas. I recommend the carbonara. If you want drinks too I recommend pre-drinks next door at rock house!"}
{"text":"Had another outstanding dinner here; I stop every trip to Vegas. (Twice a year).   The lasagna was so big and filling, and tonight the spaghetti bolognese was great.    Don't forget the Sunday gravy as a tasty option.   Alexis, our waitress, was delightful and made dinner perfect.   Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Vegas. I brought prospective customers here during Shot Show 2015 and it was an overwhelming success. We ate in the bar area during happy hour. $4 American beers (16 oz) and $5 appetizers. The food consisted of the best meatball sliders I have ever tasted, sausage and pepper sliders, calamari and ricotta cheese with garlic toast points. Outstanding food, great staff (especially Mike the bartender from The North End). What else would we expect from the Cake Boss?"}
{"text":"After reading some positive reviews I wanted to try Buddy V's for some decent Italian food. It's a nice place with a nice view of the strip, with the neon lights flickering in the background. Here is what we had:
- Grandmas Meatballs. These were pretty tast but our order was cold. I know they are not made to order  but you expect them to be warm.
-Calamari Fritti. You basic calamari with 2 slivers of a banana pepper and grilled lemon. Another dish that came out cold.
-Lisa V's Linguini and white clam sauce. This dish has the most balanced flavors and a decent amount of clams. This was the 3rd dish in a row that was cold. I would have mentioned it to our server but he wasn't around much.
-My mother in laws shrimp scampi. The one dish that came out warm . It had pretty good flavors but not the best scampi I ever had. My mother in laws is much better!.

Where most authentic Italian restaurants might offer you freshly grated parm you had to ask for it and it took a few minutes to let the food get even colder. We also asked for some bread, mainly for the scampi since it had a nice broth build up in the bottom of the bowl. The waiter looked as if I was asking for ketchup at a steak house. Another dissapointing Italian meal in Las Vegas, my search continues!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is for the experience of TRYING to eat here, NOT for the food! But trying to go to a restaurant--particularly when you are on a vacation or a Staycation--may be almost as important as eating, itself.

Went by Buddy's early in the day (in late morning), to look into dining later that night. I immediately LOVED the decor, and homey, yet elegant look. The awning, wood floors and red checkered table cloths go well together, and it feels like you are in South Street Seaport in New York.

But, the hostess was useless, and had little to tell me that morning.  She was not friendly. She seemed more interested in dancing by herself to the tune that was playing. (They play good music there). So, I just decided to return later that night with my dinner companion. 

Well, that was a mess. Now, for the first time that evening (at around 6:15pm), I learn that we needed reservations, and that the wait was 45 minutes to an hour, which we were not willing to do on our schedule.  And again, the hostess was super useless. She did not apologize for the wait, or invite us to sit at the bar (which was empty), nor did she explain why there was such a lengthy wait when we could clearly see that there were at least 4 or 5 apparently empty tables in the foreground. Instead, she made it seem like we were complete fools for not having reservations.  Not a good tactic with your prospective customers.  

And I have a pet peeve of restaurant hostesses dressed like they are headed to a trashy nightclub.  Does not fit the family vibe that Buddy's seems to be going for (especially with the quaintly named dishes after family relatives, such as Aunties and Grandma).

The bakery across from the restaurant seems much better run and friendly! 

I might return, but it will take a while and maybe some convincing."}
{"text":"AMAZING!     My friend and I both had the Sunday Dinner Gravy and it was incredible.  Service was impeccable and Joy the bartender was great! Loved conversation with her and had a brilliant time."}
{"text":"This is a great Italian food place with great views from Palazzo that look onto the strip. Good place to take your date and score of points! Lol"}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed because I was really looking forward to eating here. Buddy's menu kind of disappointed me because he is an excellent baker however the menu for his dinner is very minimal and boring. I went all the way as far as sitting at a dinner table to have dinner but after opening the menu and reading the items, I closed the menu got up and walked out the restaurant. I give him three stars because his bakery across the way is very good."}
{"text":"Girls night in Vegas on a Friday night usually a very busy night and hard to get a table but making a reservation made that so easy! Our food was beyond delicious we will definitely be back. From the environment to the service to the awesome view of the strip. They are doing great over here! Our bus boy Christian was so hospitable and got everything we needed so efficiently. Order nonnas lasagna and chicken parmesan it came out so quickly and you cannot beat the fresh out of the over bread! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, food was good on Valentine's day until the AGM Adam Marguiles( not sure of the spelling) Decided to interrupt or experience by chasing his server/bartender around yelling at her and chasing her around the bar...Then he screached at her she was cut, right next to my ear.I was shocked to see how the employees are treated there.Buddy V would not approve ,I'm sure...Someone control this situation, it was horrible.We will never go back."}
{"text":"This place was a must do for our weekend getaway! This place is so amazing that I had to write this review DURING brunch! The food is phenomenal and the service is impeccable! Cheers to Buddy V's!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since we didnt want to spend too much on a buffet. Food was not impressive. Portions are just ok and definitely pricey.

Make sure you ask for tap water so they dont charge you more than $10 on bottled water. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday and was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was. Arrived around 2:30 pm and the place was pretty dead. I didn't have high expectations for this place because it had a very chain restaurant feel. SO WRONG. 

Ordered:
x Panzanella Salad w/ Shrimp (buffalo mozzarella, focaccia croutons, tomatoes, arugula, balsamic red onions) - Salad with lots of flavor. Wait, what? It was perfect with the added shrimp, but I think if you order it without protein it'll feel more like a side salad. LOVED this salad. Croutons were amazeballs.
x Grilled Salmon (Mediterranean chickpea & artichoke salad, roasted tomato vinaigrette, balsamic) - L-L-LOVEEEEE! I like salmon, but I don't LOVE cooked salmon. kinda tastes the same for me everywhere I order it, but this one was excellent. Highly recommend for a healthy option from the menu. All the components complimented each other very well.
x Butterscotch Creme Brulee - My favorite dessert in the world. I didn't really care for the cookies or the vanilla cream it came with, but the creme brulee itself was perfection! Probably one of the best ones I've ever had. 10/10 would recommend.

Service was extremely slow, but the food made up for it. Ask to sit by the window and enjoy A+ food with a strip view :0)

Cake boss knows wssup."}
{"text":"My husband & I came here for dinner, they sat us by the window, which had awesome view of the  strip. Our waitress was pretty good, knowledge of the menu. Started with the calamari, which was good & soft. Then I had nonna 's lasagna, so good & cheesy. I would go back again."}
{"text":"I love Buddy V. It's authentic, friendly service and the views are very nice. On the weekends they have a brunch for $35 which is highly recommended since it's a buffet style and you are able to sample out many dishes, my faves are chicken parmigiana and the meatballs. The desserts are to die for as well. Great decor and great presentation"}
{"text":"AMAZING. The Lasagna was freaking amazing. Service was great. They serve Coca Cola, even bigger ++++."}
{"text":"From the service to the food, I was extremely pleased with my dining experience here.  I had caprese salad, which was very nice and the lasagna- delicious!! Portions were on the larger side but that's ok with me. It should make a nice late night snack. 
I sat at the bar since I was here alone (traveling for work). The bartenders were lovely, accommodating and attentive. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We went for hh and the food and drinks were good. We had sangria that tasted great. We ordered mac and cheese, polenta squares, meatballs, and calamari all very tasty.. better than expected."}
{"text":"The setting looks like \"mama's kitchen\", which was adorable w/ rolling pins hanging from the ceiling and bundt cake pans on the wall. Their food spoke for itself from their appetizers, dinner, to dessert. Their cheese board is a MUST and worth the price. The lasagna had a good balance w/ cheese and tomato sauce, but for dessert.... the Butterscotch Creme Brule was sooooo good from the sugary shell and the vanilla mascarpone cream. Their customer service was just the cherry on top SHOUT OUT TO PETER bruhh! I can't wait to try their brunch (.... bottomless mimosa and bellinis!)"}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. Been here many times and every time it's excellent. I've had a real link weenie and clams and the lasagna in there Mediterranean sea bass. All very good"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the NY strip steak was incredible.  Would highly recommend this place. Everyone was attentive."}
{"text":"Took my chic here last night for her birthday because she heard Buddy on 98.5 and asked if we could go, so off we went. I have been to the best places in Vegas and some are over hyped and some under hyped. I went into Buddy V's not really thinking anything was gonna be all that amazing but I was wrong on a few things.

One, The mussels they have are the best mussels I have ever eaten in my life. The mussels were so good I ordered another order after dessert.

Two, The surf and turf I ordered was cooked to perfection.

Three, The XL Lobster dessert is probably one of the most amazing things on this planet.

I love to watch new restaurants as they open just to see who really has their shit together and I think Buddy V's did a pretty good job on their opening. Staff was nervous and If I worked there I would be too. Not only is it opening day but the owner, owners business partners and the owners parents are all there. 

We were greeted by Adam Margolies who is the asst G.M. and it was really great to talk to a guy who is really into the property enough to where he had an answer for every question. I know to people reading this that may not seem like much but being from Vegas it is really hard to find knowledgeable people that know things even at the places were they work. We asked him how the XL lobster is made, where the cuts of beef were farmed from, if the scallops are flown in or driven, if the broccoli is organic, if the chocolate chips in the Gelato was made from scratch or store bought. 
We asked all these questions and he answered all of them with no hesitation. 

The decor is 10/10 for the type of restaurant it is and I think it will do well here in Las Vegas. I love eating at places that don't feel stuffy as I don't believe you should ever feel uncomfortable anywhere in Las Vegas.

Welcome to Vegas Buddy V!! Your gonna do great here and we are glad you chose Vegas to serve. Gonna get more mussels now !"}
{"text":"My husband asked what's the waiting time, the hostess she said it's 30 Minutes or maybe less. 
we go ahead waited anyway because the kids were hungry. After 30 minutes we still waiting on our table. My husband thinks they forgot about us. After they got us a table and took the orders, there were another 30 to 40 minutes waiting for 
our food. Shrimp scampi was okay, but the kids really liked the spaghetti. That's the only reason I gave them 2 stars."}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas and stopped in for an early dinner. We were extremely impressed with the food and service. We ordered a healthy amount of food, our bill was $95. We will return for sure if we're in the area again."}
{"text":"I was extremely afraid that Buddy V's Ristorante was going to end up being a case of \"never meet your heroes.\" But luckily the food that they're serving was amazing and the service was even better. We had a designated person besides are waiter taking away our plates, bringing us refills on our drinks, and giving us the best service possible. The only problem was how long the kitchen took to bring our main courses to us. After waiting about 45 minutes after we ordered for our food it finally came, and with an apology from the manager. For desert we ordered the famous lobster tail which was amazing. Definitely go if you don't mind spending the money."}
{"text":"I loved it! Disclaimer: I am a huge fan of Buddy and his shows, so I'm a lil biased.

I came in for a late lunch, the staff was friendly and attentive. It was pretty quiet, not too many people around which was nice, I didn't feel like competing or waiting for a table.

I really loved the decor, it was decorated like a nice italian kitchen; I thought the rolling pins that decorate one of the walls was a cute and creative idea. There were family pictures on the walls that gave it that homey feel, and I have to say I really appreciated that the restaurant was spacious, so it didn't seem cluttered.

My friend and I ordered Aunt Nina's Mozzerella en Carozza, which was fried mozzerella with crotini in a tomato sauce.....OMG!! So Freakin good!!!! We were tempted to order another one, but decided to wait till we had tried the rest of the food we ordered. 

We also order the linguine in white clam sauce that was also pretty good, it had lots of clams yummy!

For dessert, we got a lobster tail and a cheesecake. The lobster tail was too f*ckin good!!! We were in heaven, the flaky pastry filled with fresh custard cream and fresh berries, it was perfect balance! Not too sweet, not too tart, the berries complimented the pastry perfectly.

Needless to say after that we were stuffed, so we had to take the cheesecake to go.

This place is a must for Cake Boss fans!"}
{"text":"I came to visit for the first time for Restaurant Week for my sister's birthday. I'm pretty impressed Buddy. I have to admit that so far, your dishes taste just as good as your cakes (well...the cakes look good so maybe as good as your cakes look?) 

I booked reservations for seating on Open Table for my sister's birthday. Told them the occasion and requested a nice little \"surprise\". They did more than that. They gave us the best seat (take note here because this seat is the seat you want) in the house. You walk past kitchen, past the bar, and the main floor. You'll see these big windows that help open up the room with natural sunlight. In front of that window lies a simple yet perfect table for four. You can look right out and see the strip from above, and if I'm correct the pirate show at TI also!

My sister and I ordered the garlic bread, caprese salad, meatballs, and Chicken Parmesan. 

The MEATBALLS are definitely one I recommend, but beware! These come as appetizer and can be very filling! So if you intend to make it to dessert, I'd be careful with this one. One order would be good to share with your party. It's so full of flavor, juicy, and tender. Major noms. I think it's because of the veal. 

The GARLIC BREAD. Oh the garlic bread is also a major 5! Extra cheesy, extra buttery, and extra extra garlicy. An extra 5 points if I could because it tastes just as good as a leftover. It came with 4 HUGE pieces and one is a good size to split in half with another (that is if you're a light to medium eater). 

CAPRESE SALAD is also a great recommendation if you're looking for a nice salad to eat. Full of color and flavor. They have like 3-4 different types of tomatoes in it. There was cherry tomatoes and some tomato that is red, purple, and green (it's good I swear!). It was topped with a perfect ration to cheese and drizzled around with a light olive oil and balsamic vinegar. 

**CHICKEN PARMESAN two extra stars because Buddy V's chicken parmy will probably become that GO-TO-MUST-HAVE dish. I mean it's just chicken parmy right? I know...but it was perfect. The sauce wasn't too much nor thick or overpowering. The breading on the chicken had that perfect crunch to their tender chicken. It had that nice bed of creamy melted cheese topped with a wonderful POW of garlic flavor and herbs and spices. I'm a variety seeker so I always go to different place and try different things, but once I find THAT DISH it's hard to steer me away from it. That dish is THIS PARMY.

**DRAGO ROSSO-It hasabsolut ruby red, pomegranate, jalapeño & mango. It's divine! I love spice. This has a whole lot of spice. If you're into bloody mary's or the mexican drinks with the clamato juice. You have to try it. WARNING though. It is really spicy so if you only like a lighter taste of spice for your palette I recommend you pass.

BUT! Service was great, the ambiance was amazing. Casual, but upscale? More for business meetings, lunch, and special occasions. Lastly, it was cute after my request they surprised my sister with bakery made cookies with a light up sparkler.

{"text":"Our service was excellent! Nice, friendly, and attentive server and busser. The drinks were also great. I enjoyed the carbonara mac and cheese and caprese very much. The buddy pizza was just okay."}

{"text":"Very good service and food was good! I would not say it is a must go to place in Vegas but it will not disappoint you either."}
{"text":"Nice food and service. I like the place with enjoying out sight view and food. I'm very picky. Some of the order was not mine taste  as other might have their favourate"}
{"text":"Go here, Vegas must! BEST Italian food I have tried by far! I had their chicken parmesan which was absolutely perfect! My sister had \"Buddy's Favorite Pizza\" and it was also delicious. Their cannolis are also to die for, so yummy! Also, SUPER friendly staff! No complaints here."}
{"text":"I have heard of Buddy V thru his cake boss show but I didn't realized he had a full restaurant.  The kids had mac and cheese and a cheese pizza and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi and I had the 3 course meal with a salad, sea bass and cannoli and cookies for desert.  Everything was very good.  There was so much food we didn't have room for desert!  Good food, good service, can't do wrong here!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for work and took the family with me. My daughter who is a huge Buddy fan wanted have dinner here. She is 10 and she loved it. The place is charming, very cute. The food was very good as well. Service was friendly and fast. I would definitely come here again if I am ever in Vegas again. If you are looking to have a nice dinner at a place that  is kid friendly, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"This place has everything from great food, amazing ambience, incredible service, and live music as the icing on cake.  I came in for brunch for a friends birthday and was blown away.  They have 3 different buffet stations as well as a Bloody Mary station to build your ultimate Bloody Mary which I did.  I am stuffed and can't wait to come back.  Well I have returned and the experience was incredible once again.  The manager came by I believe her name was Milly.  Great suggestions and I loved the Nutella cake."}
{"text":"Where to begin??? This was our third trip to Buddy V's and the food will keep us coming back. We love the flavors, rich sauces, perfectly cooked meats, and quick, tasty appetizers, almost everything we have ordered here is amazing. 

The Service is good and friendly and realized last night what my biggest issue with this restaurant is. The appetizers come out fast, which is awesome, but the wait time between your apps and your entree is excruciatingly long. We ordered plenty of apps to keep us busy but 45 minutes elapsed between apps and entree. This was way too long. I think I blamed the server on my second trip when the same thing happened but I realized the kitchen is just slow to get out entrees and the servers lose attentiveness when they have nothing to bring you. I hate having to ask for more water or a refill. 

That being said, I highly recommend Buddy V's, the food is amazing Italian food, the desserts are delicious and the live music was a nice touch last night. 

Food:     5 stars
Presentation: 5 stars
Taste: 5 stars
Desserts: 5 stars
Service: 4 stars 
Waiting for second course: 2 stars
General Manager: 5 stars
Thanks for the attention and for listening to our previous concerns."}
{"text":"Everything is good, from their savory butter garlic bread to their Octopus salad to their non-rich but so damn good four layers tall tiramisu! The atmosphere is pretty darn special too (giving you a warm holiday feeling)!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!This restaurant has the best service by far and our server, Peter was simply outstanding! The GM Christina also was exceptional! My husband and I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Good all-around experience. Came here with a group of 7 business colleagues. We decided to go with their special \"family style\". This was a great call as we got many, many plates of appetizers, mains, and desserts. Very good value for money when you have many folks sharing!

The ambiance was an enjoyable one. A touch loud on the music, but hey it's Vegas, that's petty much the norm. Good for families and business groups alike. Good options for wine and cocktails as well!"}
{"text":"Great food and decently priced. And the service was amazing. The restaurant was about to close and they served us. They were extremely friendly. The live music is pretty good and is somewhat loud but enjoyable. Some people might not like the music though. The view is also pretty good too."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise. Better than I expected. Very authentic Italian good that reminded me of home (New York). The meatballs and eggplant parmigiana were like my Mom used to make - delicious! The cannoli was to die for! My kids loved it too."}
{"text":"Decided to try Buddy V's when I was out with one of my friends since we both had been wanting to go. When we arrived, they told us that they didn't have any tables available. I could see that there were open tables, so I'm not 100% sure this was true. My friend mentioned that he was an employee at the Venetian, so the hostess said she could seat us in about 10 minutes. They put us at a table in the back corner of the restaurant with empty tables all around. I wasn't a fan of being put back in the corner. It took a bit for our server to come to our table, so the experience didn't start out too great. 
I thought that the food was okay, but nothing to write home about. 
I haven't been back since, and I honestly didn't even think about Buddy V's last time I was thinking about going to an Italian restaurant on the strip. 
It's possible I might give it another shot."}
{"text":"Located in the Palazzo Hotel, it's not the best Italian food on the Strip, plus the service was poor. We spotted this restaurant, after seeing the huge line for Carlos' Bakery. That's the bakery from the TV show Cake Boss. Honestly, who would wait 30 minutes for a pastry, when Sprinkles Cupcakes is down the street and pure perfection. Anyway, we saw Buddy V's and read the menu at the front door. The prices seemed reasonable for a Strip restaurant, so we made reservations for 7:00 p.m. We arrived on time, only to wait 30 minutes while they took walk-ins before us. Once seated, the greeting was non-existent. I actually had to stop our waiter, and ask what his name was. It was Chas. After bringing our beverages, he quickly recited the one special, and he asked what we wanted. Totally rushed. I stopped him right there, and began asking questions about the restaurant. \"Chas, who is Carlos?\" \"If Carlos and Buddy V are famous for their cakes, why did they open an Italian restaurant?\" As he became increasingly annoyed with my questions, he explained that the restaurant is based on Buddy V's grandmother's recipes, not Buddy's recipes. Naturally, I commented that Buddy V shouldn't have his name on the restaurant if they're not his recipes. Oh well, just a logically conclusion. The veal Marsala came with a side of pasta. The pasta was good, but the veal Marsala was tough and the sauce was tasteless. Really salty and bland. Our dining experience lasted a quick 35 minutes...even with my insistent questions. Don't waste your money or 35 minutes eating here. There's lots better Italian restaurants on The Strip."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! We went on Christmas Eve because it was one of the few with reservation still available that had good reviews. We loved it!! Service was on point, we got our meals fast, food tasted delicious. The pizza sauce is great!"}
{"text":"AMAZING DINNER! I went to Buddy V's with my family and was a bit nervous at first. I love the show and have been dying to try this restaurant since Buddy announced he was opening it. It was probably one of the best Italian meals I have had in a long time, the meatballs were amazing, great portion size and lots of flavour. The caesar salad was also good, very garlicky which I like. Next was the mains, we got a few but the most memorable were the shrimp pasta and the spaghetti and meatballs. Both had tons of flavour and great portion sizes. We were celebrating my 25th birthday and all I wanted was to try something at Carlos Bakery. The manager was incredible, he went across to the bakery and got me a cupcake because he knew how much I wanted to try it and the line was crazy. For dessert, we also had the apple pie, this was the only item we ordered I was not crazy about. It came out like a hard cookie shell and it was nothing to write home about. The waiter was very annoying, he kept trying to push us to order things and he didn't take no for an answer until we said it more firmly. However, overall, it was a great meal. The manager Adam was very nice and seemed to really enjoy his job. He was all about customer service and customer satisfaction. 
My only recommendation is people who dine at the restaurant should also be able to go to the bakery."}
{"text":"I was all excited to eat at Cake Boss Buddy V's and it was a treat.. The staff is very very friendly and made me at home!! This is a very relaxing place with tables that gives you a killer view of the strip.. I always wanted to try the Grandma's Meatballs that Buddy V is popular for and man they were soooooooo good !! Full of flavour and moist .. Simply an awesome brunch for me!! 

Next is to head to his Shop right in front the Carlo's Bake Shop for the famous Cannolis !!! I am soooo full :) ...."}
{"text":"This restaurant is exemplary. The waiter told me that the Philly Cheesesteak was voted one of the best outside of Philadelphia. He was exactly right. I also had the Nutella cake and it was divine. The service was fast, attentive, and friendly. I would return here in the future."}
{"text":"So lazy. That's part of my Vegas living. I don't want to go too far for food. Luckily this was a short walk away from where I was staying at the Venetian

What I ate: 
- Cheese and charcuterie plate: I love cheese, I love charcuterie. Why wouldn't you enjoy this? Great to share. My friends didn't like the blue cheese, but I gobbled it all up!
- Chicken rigatoni alla vodka: Plenty of large chicken pieces, flavorful sauce. This was just a tad on the salty side. The rigatoni were perfectly al dente!
- Buddy's special pizza: Dough was fresh and flavorful, the toppings were delicious. I was glad I stole a slice from my friend and tried it

Pros:
- Easy access from the strip, located in the venetian shops
- Ten min walk from venetian hotel
- Great food
- Service was nice
- Plenty of room for large or small parties. I watched staff bring together tables for groups of 10, and quickly break it down for smaller parties
- loved the open kitchen
- you can definitely get some of their famous desserts without having to wait in like across the hall at their bakery
- Lots of bright light and space

Cons:
- can be confusing to find if you've never been there
- Lots of bright light. If you're nursing a hangover, this may not be the place for you. Order the pasta/pizza to go and eat it in the dark cave of your hotel room

Would I come again? Sure"}

A good thing happened to my wife and I. We were driving down Las Vegas Boulevard and were trying to decide where we wanted to eat lunch.

Heart Attack Grill ? Been there, done that. Please see review.
Carson Kitchen ? Been there, done. Please see review.
Lagasse's Stadium? Been there, done that as well. Please see review.

Lola's Louisiana Kitchen?
Rock N Noodles?
Grimaldi's Pizzeria?  
Been... there... done... that...
Please... See... Review.

Long story short, we found Buddy V's Ristorante and we enjoyed it a lot!
I ate a Hoboken Cheesesteak. I love cheesesteak, but have never been to Hoboken. I'm not really sure what Hoboken would taste like? But the sandwich was delicious.

My wife ate a Chicken BLT and said her's was delicious as well. 
Service was spectacular. Our server, Danny was one of the best we have had along Las Vegas Boulevard. If you don't believe me please see my review for Mon Abi Gabi. 

The bill was under $40.00! But then again that was without alcohol. That's right it is possible to eat on Las Vegas Boulevard and not consume alcohol!

I have two concerns about Buddy V's Ristorante. One, the bakery across the hallway is over the top and smells addicting. Two, there is a kid's menu, but I have a feeling, Buddy V's Ristorante would not be good for kids in the later hours of the day. Lunch or early dinner, sure. 

Great Place. Great Service. In closing I would like to suggest reading my review for Buddy V's Ristorante... but you just did."}
{"text":"Everything was beyond delicious.  Calamari was tender with the proper hint of seafood taste.  The shrimp scampi I ordered was perfect, the added side of scallops were done right.  Angel hair pasta was el dented and not sticky. The atmosphere, the staff, the service was amazing.  You guys crushed it!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  My choice of pasta taste like it was home made.  I finished every bite!  We had a nice view to the Vegas strip"}
{"text":"Mamma Mia!!! Wow!!! Way to go Buddy Valastro! This feels like a classic Italian home the second you walk in. Family photos of the Valastro family, hodgepodge furniture, comfy sofas and chairs...only thing missing is the vinyl and plastic covers, but honestly who misses them? 

Teaming up with Kim Canteenwalla & Elizabeth Blau, who have created beautiful restaurants here in Vegas (Society Cafe + Honey Salt), the trio came together to make the Cake Bosses culinary debut a real knockout, start to finish. 

I went with my Italian buddy to try it out and we were really impressed (to say the least)! Straight forward and diverse food menu, doesn't overwhelm; drink menu follows the pattern of the food menu with good wine choices by the glass.

I chose the agnolotti which was seasoned perfectly and was in season with the sage brown butter sauce. My buddy went to spaghetti central with a rigatoni and meatball bowl and he couldn't hold back the tears knowing the impending rejection his mother would give him after finding a better meatball. 

The meatballs came really really really close to beating my Italian grandmother's secret recipe, but that leads to a lifetime of questions and heartache on my nonna. So, its easier to say that grams are better and avoid the remaining years of rejection by telling her a little white lie.

Dessert was the highlight (as expected) as my Tiramisu was not only flavorful but semi deconstructed as the lady fingers were on the side that you could dip into the cake and creme combo. My friend's salted caramel ice cream came loaded with bits of dark chocolate and an awesome biscotti.

If the restaurant wasn't in the Venetian/Palazzo's Grand Canal Shoppes: A) It would be way busier and the menu prices wouldn't be so high; and B) it wouldn't have awesome floor to ceiling windows facing the strip that make the space even more visually enjoyable.

Mangia!"}
{"text":"We spent NYE at Buddy Vs at the Palazzo. What a great experience!  The food was great, fresh and tasty and not too much, but enough to share tastes with everyone at the table. I had the linguini and white clam sauce, it was delish. I also appreciated that most dishes were slightly under salted. The flavors really came out. But, if you go for no other reason, go for Giorgio!  Even though the place was crazy busy he took the time to give us special service. I've been in family-run trattorias in Italy and that's how Giorgio made us feel, just as if we were in his family's kitchen. It's Buddy's, don't skip dessert!  We had the Italian birthday cake and, Giorgio you were right. It made me forget about run-of-the-mill tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing!! Perfect portion sizes and unique twists to traditional recipes. Try the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. Delicious!! And not what you expect!! Service is personalized and impeccable!!"}
{"text":"I came here Friday evening for my birthday.it was kinda hard to find,but when I did it was well worth it.very nice restaurant,open,clean and great atmosphere.we had a booth by the window with an amazing view of the strip.our waiter was awesome!! Be prepared to spend some $ for two pple it was 98.00. We got a Caesar salad,lasagna,lobster tail and shrimp dish.the lasagna was to die for...so amazing and dishes are very filling.most people were dressed in just shorts and thirst I felt overdressed."}
{"text":"Had a blast with two others I was with. The server, Danielle was great. Very knowledgable and attentive. The food was very good, pizza and pasta. The two I was with enjoyed the deserts also."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Mother's Day & the service was excellent!  My guy had the Sea scallops  and they were cooked to perfection. I had the Chicken Parmesan & spaghetti & it was delicious ! We had the meat & cheese board for starters. Everything was just perfect! Nice casual dining experience & delectable Italian dishes."}
{"text":"We came across the restaurant and I really want it to have dinner their to celebrate my birthday.  When we asked if we need it any reservations the restaurant hostess was very rude. I asked if we can make reservations for a later time and with an attitude she said \"well I guess,  I'll try and squeeze you in,\" although I really want it to eat their didn't feel like dealing with attitude. We decided to eat at a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was a little slow. I've had better Italian. 
My friends' food was a disaster -tasteless and too salty. Mine was ok. 2 stars for the price and meh food."}
{"text":"We had the Roma Gnocchi, Mac & Cheese, Lasagna, and Cheese Ravioli. All were amazing! We sat in the bar area watching the game. Our server, Christian, was top notch! I'm talking Disney trained top notch. Had the Butterscotch Creme Brûlée for desert. It was to die for! So glad we came here to eat."}
{"text":"Had been at the Venetian for 2 days and realized that I have't eaten any Italian food. Walked past Buddy V's several times and decided to make reservations for later in the evening. When I arrived I was seated promptly. The menu was short and sweet covered all of the classics. I usually order Chicken Parm but I was in the mood for Spaghetti. The noodles were great and the meat sauce had great consistency. Buddy V's is very approachable and a solid choice for classic Italian cuisine. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Made a reservation through Open Table for my birthday. We arrived right on time and were immediately seated at our table. We were immediately given ice water which was much needed in Vegas! 

My husband ordered the Sunday Gravy and I had the Agnolotti which was a ravioli filled with a mixture of beef, pork and veal covered in a sage brown butter sauce. We also shares the garlic bread which we didn't really need because they bring you this delicious focattia bread fresh from the oven. During our meal the manager came by and chatted with us for quite a while about restaurants in Chicago he and my husband has both visited. He let us know that what I ordered was the best dish on the menu. 

We could have easily shares the Sunday Gravy between the 2 of us because we were so stuffed we had to order dessert to go! Bit the cannoli was delicious in our hotel room a few hours later!

As with most great places in Vegas it helps to make a reservation so you don't have to wait. And I will absolutely bring my family next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Went for the Brunch Buffet, I chose the unlimited beverage add-on. Food fresh and delicious (Mac-n-cheese carbonara & cannolis were my faves) mimosas were great & Thanks to the attentiveness of Graciela, well replenished!! She made the experience just so awesome along with the natural daylight beaming in & the cool wisk chandeliers & rolling pin decor! She was very friendly & inviting considering they were kind of busy..! She should be recognized!!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Our server was very nice and the busgirl was nice as well.  They were very attentive, no attitude and the food was good and came out quick (they were very busy too) I had the calamari which tasted very fresh, meatballs and parmesan chicken .  Most servers here in vegas are consistently nice compared to our area(md) ."}
{"text":"Lisa's warm nutella cake is exceptional and so are the people who work here. Emily was super sweet and made my day."}
{"text":"Excellent! Service was great, very friendly and entertaining. Good wine list, reasonably prices- menu with good variety of classic Italian meals- we had the octopus with fingerling potatoes- very good, tender with orange, rather than the usual lemon
  Also had the caprese salad with small tomatoes and fresh mozzarella-very good 
  Chicken Marsala was excellent, with side if pasta, lasagna was incredible, a veritable brick if meats and cheeses! Plop, you will jot leave hungry
  Ended the meal with lobster tail, split ingest 4 people- very good with its flakey crust and creamy goodness

Overall, great meal, reasonably priced - would definitely return"}
{"text":"What do the macaroni grill, bucca di beppo and Buddy V have in common? More than you would think.

 We had the lasagna and chicken marsala, both were fine, but very ordinary. If you gave me these dishes from any of those 3 restaurants I don't think I could tell the difference. That doesn't mean the food is bad, but Buddy V advertises and charges like it's something more.  

On a side note the lasagna was a massive block of melted cheese, it was very heavy. Again not a bad thing if you love cheese."}
{"text":"Wow! What a gorgeous, cozy restaurant with beautiful views of the Las Vegas Strip! I absolutely ADORED the decor, from the lighting fixtures to the brick walls displaying real photos of Buddy Valasco's family, to the STUNNING open-air kitchen!! I just felt HAPPY being in engulfed in the ambiance of this restaurant! 

The staff was so friendly and the food was classic, comfort and delicious. (don't miss that salumi/cheese board! YUMMMMMM)

This will be the next place that I plan a big get-together because it is PERFECT for large parties. Can't say it enough... I LOVE it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our second stop at Buddy V's while visiting Vegas.  First you can't beat the location if you are a shopper.  The restaurant is located in the Canal Shoppes which is one of our favorite haunts while visiting.

What always blows me away is the line across from the restaurant for his bakery, it usually is formed at least halfway down the corridor.  All I can say is the bakery must be delish....but I digress.

We only had to wait 10 minutes for a table at lunch which you can sit in the bar or wait in the corridor.  We were seated in the bar area.  The best way to describe the vibe here is casual chic.  The restaurant feels very open yet has a Brooklyn restaurant feel to it.  Servers are dressed casually and make you feel very comfortable.

I would have liked the server to be a little more friendly...don't get me wrong she was very efficient...just didn't seem happy to be there.  However she gave us great service and everyone has those days so it did not take away from the experience.

I had the eggplant parmesan  which was HUGE and delicious.  No way I could eat it all or even half of it...but I sure did enjoy trying.  Hubby had the spaghetti and loved it.  The cheese garlic bread is like an entree on its own...perfectly toasted with yummy gooey cheese.We both enjoyed the menu as all of the entrees have special ties to the owner like My Wife's Eggplant Parmesan or Lisa V's Linguine, this just gives you the feeling of being in an Italian grandmas kitchen.

Hubby ordered a Buddy V's lobster tail for dessert and I can tell you they look just like they do on his tv show...big and stuffed full of tasty goodness.  I only had a bite as i was still trying to tackle the eggplant parm but it was magnificent.

This is definitely going to become a lunch tradition when we are in Vegas.  Great food at reasonable prices"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant for our 6 year anniversary on Friday 9-11-15, he had made a reservation with a special request for desert as a surprise to me! I have been wanting to come to this place for some time as I'm a huge fan of Buddy!! 

We show up and get seated very quickly it was about 8:45-9:00pm we are sitting for five minutes when a biased comes to the table and asks us if we would like some water...sure he brings us water...we've never been here before so we are taking our time with the menu and decide to order mozzarella as an appetizer when our server finally arrived at our table we had already drank our glass of water it was a good 15 minutes after we sat down...unacceptable if you ask me! I don't know his name cause he talked so fast and was trying really hard with what seemed like a fake accent to be \"cool\" and laughed at himself....we told him we've never been here and that we would like to order the mozzarella...he then said are you ready to put on your Order for dinner...I said could I have a few minutes he then proceeded to say that I wanted the Veil Parmesan without giving me time to look uhh ok I guess I'll have that since you are in such a rush for me to order when you haven't even put in my appetizer...my boyfriend ordered lasagna...
I never saw my server again...well not willingly anyways...I had to flag him down for more water...the buss men were passing out cheese bread and vinegar and oil to every table that was there...except us not once were we offered anything nor where my drinks refilled without having to ask!! I wanted to order a soda and nope didn't even get to do that!!!
Our appetizer came was different and so yummy!!! Server never came to see how we where....our food came no server nothing...what if I didn't like my food...oh but I had to flag a biased down again for more water even though they have walked by my table 100 times and I know they seen my water empty!!!
So on with it...I had to yell for my server who had been ignoring us after I've asked for him 3 times by a bus man he came I said may I please have a box...10 min later my box arrived...he asked if we wanted desert I said may I see a menu!!(been wanting Buddy's lobster take for years almost went to New Jersey just to try one!!) then my boyfriend asks for a manager cause the special request he set up was to have a lobster tail desert show up to the table as a surprise with writing on the plate saying happy anniversary....my boyfriend was so upset that they ruined the surprised when he talked to the manager he kind of still felt like it was no big deal!! A new server delivered our desert and the comped it(didn't asked them to nor did we want them to) 

At the end of everything the SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE! I have been in customer service my whole life never would I treat someone the way we were treated!! We felt abandoned when the people around us where being well taken care of!!!

I give a HUGE SHOUT OUT TO THE KITCHEN THOUGH!! FOOD WAS AMAZING!!! I don't eat leftovers never have my whole life but I did eat the left overs for dinner Saturday!! That says something!!

Just disappointing about the service kind of heartbroken cause j was so excited to finally be going to BUDDY V's"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. The Bucatini is the best Ive ever had! Could eat it again and again."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had in Vegas hands down. We were seated promptly after arriving for our reservation. Hostess was very nice and friendly. All the food came out pretty fast for as busy as they were. The server was pretty short and blunt but he never let our drinks run dry and came by to check on us pretty consistently I would recommend this to anyone coming to Vegas that's likes Italian food. Just make sure you call ahead and make a reservation a day or two in advance"}
{"text":"A friend who also travels often to Las Vegas asked me to do one thing on this visit...and that was visit Buddy V's and just sit at the bar for minimum one drink.

Everything she said about the bar was accurate: Comfortable, great view of The Strip and really friendly employees.

Honestly, it was not easy to find this place and I know my way around The Venetian as a longtime fan of Grand Lux Cafe and that casino floor where I once played blackjack with 90210 hottie Lindsay Price.

My bartender at Buddy V's was a tremendously nice guy named Mike and he poured me a strong vodka cocktail.

The entire place just smelled too good to not at least look at the menu while sipping so Mike steered me right in a modest order of Grandma's Meatballs with some delicious bread that was exactly the right amount of food.

This simply was not your typical Vegas bar or restaurant experience...and that's why I will be back on my next visit.

Oh, and the place has some nice windows that overlook The Strip and a few tables are right against these windows if you want to just eat, drink and take it all in.

Buddy V's wasn't too loud, wasn't too snobby, wasn't too busy and wasn't too expensive either.

Maybe the fact that it is not easy to find is a good thing for those of us who already know about it."}
{"text":"Had a birthday dinner here and the staff was amazing.  The night we went there was a live performer there and he was great! The food, price, portions, and staff were all fantastic!"}
{"text":"We made this reservation on New Years Eve, not knowing what to expect from a restaurant on the strip. Our experience in one word, AWESOME! From the exceptional service, to appetizer (meat and cheese board amazing), to entree (Lasagna is a no brained yummy) and finally dessert (Italian wedding cake, never had this before...soooo good) Buddy V's hit a home run. Thank you for making the start of 2018 very delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for my Wife's Birthday. It was \"FANTASTIC\" the service was awesome and the dishes that we ordered were delicious. It was impressive!!!  The only thing missing was not being able to meet Buddy in person and having the staff sing happy birthday.. I love his TV show Cake Boss and I'm a big fan.

Hopefully next time we can meet him."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for Italian! I made a reservation online so we didn't have to wait for a table.  I would advise doing that if possible as it is a very busy place! 

The wait staff is incredible! There is the main waiter and then they have another waiter working for the main waiter.  Setting tables, refilling drinks, bringing bread, etc.  It was a very unique concept that I had never seen before.  It made things run so smoothly. 

They start you off with some amazing complementary focaccia bread. It is seasoned with some Italian seasonings and cheese. It was piping hot when delivered to us in a very cute basket.  I ordered Nonna's lasagna AL forno. The waiter asked if I was ready for the most incredible lasagna I've ever eaten?! To be honest I was kind of thinking \"ya right.\"  well...  He was right! It really was the best lasagna I've ever had! The presentation was great as well.  It came in a cute little cast iron skillet. We also ordered the garlic cheese bread.  It was good but I honestly liked the focaccia bread better! 

You will not be disappointed coming here. The relaxed family atmosphere was very nice! There were pictures of buddy's family on the walls which made it feel like home.  Can not wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"The cheese ravioli is wonderful! The spaghetti was also great. But the desserts!!! OMG! The cannoli was delicious , and the cheesecake too! Wait staff could not have been nicer or any better. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The Nutella chocolate cake and the salted caramel ice cream were to die for! Everything was amazing and we'll definitely be back again"}
{"text":"I didn't know Cake Boss had a restaurant here and I actually found it through Instagram. My friend and I came on Saturday and we sat at the bar since it was happy hour. We ordered the sausage and pepper sliders, mac n cheese and Italian birthday cake. And we were very pleased with our order. The sliders tasted like what you would expect typical sausage and peppers, but tasty. Mac n cheese had chicken and veggies, which is more like a entree versus what most Americans think of it being a side dish.  Service was standard and considering we sat at the bar I've never had a bartender treat me poorly, but I must admit she was kind of awkward towards us. Lastly, the Italian birthday cake was really moist, but not dippy. I can't wait to come here again and try the Chicken Parmigiana, a customer next to us ordered this and it looked delicious. I highly recommend Buddy V's to anyone especially if you're at Venetian already."}
{"text":"The dining experience was great.  They accommodated our party of 8 with no reservation, the wait was minimal, and the food was good.  
But, they added a $29 branzino to the bill that we didn't order.  When I inquired about the mystery dish to the manager, she could only bring the waitress to apologize and say sorry.  Is this normal practice??  
Restaurant policy is to simply add an entree to any large party and hope they will just sign and leave?
Very shady.
Be sure to double check your receipt!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good Italian food with a fun, casual atmosphere.

When we are in town we love to go to Buddy V's."}
{"text":"I would honestly give this 10 stars if I could.

I was craving lemon chicken and saw on the menu they had chicken paccata, which is close enough if I modify it. So my husband and I walked from our hotel over to Buddy Vs without having a reservation. When I first saw the place, and how large it was, I kind of thought this might be just a so-so place, maybe closer to fast food than I had hoped. But it absolutely was not fast food. It was lovely.

Upon being seated, our waiter (Peter) immediately came over to inquire about drinks. When I went to order, my picky self literally needed to modify everything (sorry, chef). Instead of a salad, I asked if I could have just tomatoes and cucumbers with a little lemon. For the chicken piccata, I asked for it without the capers and without any garnish. Sweet Peter says, \"oh, so you basically want lemon chicken?\"  Be still my beating heart. Yes. My cucumbers and tomatoes (at least 3 different varieties) came out quickly and were fresh and delicious. My lemon chicken came out exactly as I wanted it.

From the person filling the water, to the person bringing bread to the table, to the person delivering the food, and - of course - Peter, the service was way beyond our expectations. Not once was I made to feel that my modifying the food was a problem, which is huge to a picky eater like myself. Everyone was genuinely nice, enough so that we went out of our way to find the manager before we left to let them know how happy we were.

If I am in Las Vegas again, I will definitely visit this restaurant and will specifically ask to sit in Peter's section. I hope he knows he can never, ever quit.  :)"}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Decor. Great Service. Started with a glass of Merlot and the eggplant parmesan appetizer. A crispy tower of eggplant with a golden brown exterior coated with piping hot cheese. Definitely a winner. The shrimp scampi was a delicious main course with a healthy amount of shrimp in a nest of linguine, roasted garlic, spinach, tomato and white wine. For dessert we enjoyed the Nutella cake with salted caramel ice cream. I'm not usually one for dessert but how could I pass up salted caramel ice cream!? All things considered it was a great experience and I'd certainly dine there again."}
{"text":"5 Stars for Food. 2 Stars for Service.

The food was absolutely delicious!

From the reviews I expected it to be really good but it was excellent. My husband who isn't a big \"food\" person, was actually quite giddy. I got a Caesar Salad and Chicken Parmesan. The Chicken Parmesan and the Spaghetti it came with, was the best I have ever had. My husband had the Panzanella Salad and Orecchiette Pasta. He said both were amazing. We also shared the Warm Nutella Cake. It was magical. 

I could tell that they took great pride in the way the food was made.

The service was really spotty. Maybe it's because they just opened. But the food was so good it all worked out."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for a bachelorette celebration and we planned to have a nicer dinner on the last day of our stay. Everyone loves Italian, right?! Right! 
Buddy V's is located inside the Palazzo and on one side is the restaurant and on the other side is the cake shop. We had reservations for 7pm on a Sunday night (on Memorial day weekend) and we still had to wait a pretty long time to be seated. So much for a reservation, but that's not too huge of a deal I guess. I was just getting tired standing in my heels lol. 
Aesthetically, this plays feels very home-y, which I liked. There were photos of Buddy and his family members incorporated into the dessert menu (it was really cute), and there were photos all around the restaurant--makes you just feel good inside when you know that this is a longtime family tradition! 

We were seated and a few minutes passed before we met our server. He introduced the idea that we could order family style or we could just order individual plates. Although ordering family style would probably be a more economical option, it was just too much fuss to do with a group of 8 girls. A lot of us (including myself) ended up getting the chicken parm, and a few others ordered a pasta dish (the one with the vodka sauce, I forgot the  name). ALL OF THE FOOD WAS SO DELICIOUS. WOW. Even the appetizers and bread that we got was finger-licking good. JUST LET THE CARBS WIN. GET THE FOCCACIA BREAD APPETIZER TOO. You'll thank me later... 

Although we didn't need the server too much, he was nowhere to be found, never really checked up on us, so service gets a ding. 
The price point was really reasonable given the enormous portions we got (chicken parm dish gives you 2 large breast cutlets; this is easily shareable). We had tons of leftovers that we happily ate after a long night of dancing. 

The only reason this review gets 4 stars is because the service. It was just lacking. But everything else, just superb! Superb food, superb pricing, portions, value, etc. I try not to eat that many carbs, but when in Vegas, carb it up. And come here to do it. Pasta and bread all day BRO! ha."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money going to Buddy V's for Happy Hour.  We were seated outside the restaurant in the walkway and the seats had wood slates that were uncomfortable. We tried 6 dishes that were basically fast junk food with little flavor.

Our waitress was hap hazard with her service forgetting twice to fetch a glass for a bottled drink and only bringing 5 of the 6 appetizers with the 6th one arriving about 15 minutes later.

Afterwards we walked across to Carlos bakery and there was not one item that looked spectacular.  Food was grossly overpriced even in comparison to other Strip bakeries by 30%."}
{"text":"Ótima opção de comida Italiana no Venatian em Las Vegas. Fomos muito bem atendidos e a comida estava muito gostosa. Pedimos de entrada anéis de lula frito e os mesmos estavam perfeitos, de entrada eu pedi o sea bass, muito bem feito e com sabor leve, meu parceiro pediu às vieiras e tive a oportunidade de experimentar, estavam deliciosas."}
{"text":"This is 2nd time we came back for Chilean Seabass (only in October).  I am not a fan of fish but this fish is the bomb!!! Simple cookingn with garlic but perfect combination with salad.  Defenitly need to try if you have a cahnce."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant in a sea of Italian restaurants at the blue canal shoppes. My wife had the half chicken and she very much enjoyed it. I was craving spaghetti and meatballs and I really enjoyed my meal. I will admit we did get two very basic dishes but I've been to a lot of places where they mess up meatballs and this place did it right. We also got calamari for an appetizer and as a connoisseur of calamari I can tell u that Buddy Vs is top notch they have a very good sauce they serve it with. Now the best part. The bread. Their bread might be the best bread I've ever had at an Italian restaurant. My issue was that they didn't give enough."}
{"text":"Was disappointed with the food and service, all I can say about this place is OK.... 
I had the chicken parmigiana, it was good, but the sauce was very acidic, way too strong for me, I had asked the server prior to ordering and she said it was very mild.
My friend had the carbonara, she said it was average.
Our other friend had the scallops and she liked it."}
{"text":"I couldn't leave Vegas or the Venetian without having some Italian food and I especially wanted to try Buddy V's. We only had time to run by for happy hour but I'm glad we did. I grabbed a glass of house red - not my fav but okay. I ordered the meatball small plate and the Mac n cheese small plate for my husband and I to share. The food was delicious. I really wanted to try the chicken parm but I wanted to stick to a small plate. Hm add a chicken parm slider!!!  So the happy hour menu has $4 drinks and $5 small plates. I will post a photo. The weird thing was that you could only get happy hour pricing if you say in certain spots of the bar. I laughed at the hostess. I have never been to a place that excludes certain bar seating. So if you want happy hour pricing - sit at the bar or the high tops. The low tables and other options are excluded"}
{"text":"The food here was good, but wasn't anything to rave about.

We started with the fried calamari.  It was served with banana peppers, which I love.  The calamari itself was tender and not rubbery.

We both went for the chicken parmesan.  My husband loved it, I thought it was just average.  I wasn't in love with the flavor of the sauce, so had to doctor it up with red pepper flakes and parmesan.

The service was not that great.  Our waitress was pleasant, but never came around.

You can get a decent meal here, but for the price, you will not be blown away."}
{"text":"Usually we find with celebrity places that the impression outweighs the quality of what we anticipate we are going to have. 
Such is not the case with Buddy V. The food was amazing from grands meatballs to egg frittata and red velvet cake. We went for brunch and between both of us tasted all we could with no complaints at all.
The service was great and everything tasted homemade from family recipes. We didn't eat again the rest of the day and there was something for everyone (except fish) since its Italian.
I do have a suggestion though:
If you are eating at Buddy's how about providing a menu for the pastry shop across the way and having those to go orders ready and waiting. Having to wait in line shouldn't be something you have to do if you have already splurged on the meal.
Pricey but worth it. Reservations recommended'"}
{"text":"We went to Buddy V's on opening night. Our server was a little nervous but did a good job. Buddy and his family were in the restaurant and were very friendly. I had Caesar salad which featured freshly made croutons that were crunchy on the outside and creamy inside. For a main course I had the chicken parm it was nicely breaded still crunchy just enough sauce and small side of spaghetti. For dessert 3 of us shared the lobster tail and Nutella cake. The lobster tail pastry was a little tough but the filling was great the Nutella cake was amazing. The decor was very welcoming like grandmas house and whimsical with bakery influenced designs."}
{"text":"I went to Buddy's for the first time last week and I was very impressed! My mom and I shared Buddy's Favorite Pizza I believe was the name. And I actually think I fell in love. Everything about it was amazing. We actually shared with the random group next to us. The atmosphere is great! There is a fantastic view of the Strip. You can watch the cooks make meals which is fun for the kids! The service was also very good! The Assistant General Manager Adam was as nice as can be. The only problem is there isn't a Buddy's where I live!"}
{"text":"Not a bad experience, but definitely didn't meet my expectations. I'm a Cake Boss fanatic and have stood in line for hours to get in to Carlos Bakery in Hoboken when it was the only location, so Buddy V's was a no brainer. 

A long line outside the bakery across the hallway, but no wait for the restaurant, possibly just because it was FILLED with exhaust/smoke. They assured us it was not normally that way and let us pick our table in the least-smoky area of the restaurant, which overall got better as we went. Not sure what the issue was.

The octopus salad was super small, so I was glad I wasn't that hungry. More so, the octopus smelled like tuna in a can. I've never had octopus that smelled bad, and almost didn't eat it, but took a chance. The special Cake Boss dessert cocktail was strong, gross, and the red velvet crumbs on top weren't even red. 

There are two cakes on the dessert menu, and we got both. The chocolate cake was underwhelming, but the Italian Birthday Cake.... oh my gosh amazing. Is this really what Italian Birthday Cake is like? We have been DOING. IT. WRONG. Chocolate ganache filling AND cannoli filling, covered with mounds of fresh whipped cream, sliced almonds. Definitely Top 5-10 desserts of my life.

Our waiter Charlie was very nice, but he was overbooked it seemed as it took 12 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and we often waited and waited just to have someone walk by so we could grab their attention. I also asked him 3 separate times to bring the check before he did. 

It all felt extremely, extremely overpriced, too. $100 for 2 entrees, a cocktail, and 2 desserts, that mostly were not very good? Meh. 

Pro-tip to you people standing in line at the bakery: if the dessert you're planning on ordering there is on the Buddy V's restaurant dessert menu... why are you waiting? Order it here. (But skip the food.)"}
{"text":"Asked for side salad with dressing on the side. Got a side salad with dressing mixed in. 
Ordered a meatball sub, the bread was so stale that I wasn't able to bite through it. I told the waitress she gave me a sad look but didn't respond, didn't offer to replace or partial refund. 
Disappointing. 
Atmosphere was decent thats why this place gets 2/5 stars."}
{"text":"I wanted to just check out Carlo's and didn't know Buddy's was here.  I was so tired from travel and we were staying at the venetian anyway that we just came here.  My wife got the spaghetti and meatballs and I got the Sunday Gravy, which includes Lamb, meatballs, sausage, and pork, and pasta all for $26.  We also got the Cesar Salad which they told us was too big for one person and gave it to us on separate plates to share :) .   I've never had croutons like the ones they served.  Had I known they tasted that good I would have asked for extras.  There was so much food we didn't have room for desert.  We will have to stop by Carlo's in the morning and pick up a few for our road trip to the grand canyon."}
{"text":"We just finished doing some engagement photos at Venetian, and decided we wanted to try some Italian nearby. Buddy V's had good reviews, so why not?

On one hand, we were incredibly impressed with the quality of the food. We're accustomed to plain-jane low-budget Italian restaurants (that many people scoff at even calling Italian) like Olive Garden. Buddy V's was accommodating and everything we tried was exquisite. They even made a custom Alfredo sauce for me that they don't have on their current menu.

I had the eggplant parmesan with added Alfredo, as well as the cheesy garlic bread and a caesar salad. The eggplant was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy and full on the inside. And the Alfredo was to die for, especially since I had been craving it so bad. And their caesar salad had croutons made of polenta! Definitely never had that before! It reminded us of tofu at first, but we knew it couldn't be. So good!
The fiancé also was in love with his lasagna but had devoured way too much bread for sure beforehand, and whined that he couldn't finish the size. Haha. 

The downsides of this place is that it was busy, so we ended up having to ask for our own complimentary bread and balsamic/olive oil dip that only about half the restaurant was getting. Also we got sat next to this horrendous couple that were so weird and probably bored with their lives that they sat there discussing and making fun of us like we wouldn't be able to see and hear them. Not really Buddy V's fault, but it dampened my experience.

If I'm remembering right,  they have 7-days-a-week happy hour. That's always a plus for any restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by Buddy V's. I had a fantastic Caesar salad with warm polenta cubes and Veal Marsala that was delicious. I'd say that the prices were in line with a standard Vegas restaurant. We sat in the bar area by the HUGE windows which gave us a great view of the strip. If you're in the area and want some Italian food, it's worth your time to check Buddy V's out."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. We expected a lot more for the price and hype. 

Only thing that really stood out was the appetizers: meatballs and tomato soup. Very fresh and well seasons. But it's $13 for 3 meatballs so I would really not expect anything short of amazing at that price point. 

As for the pasta, nothing exciting about the flavors or presentation. The ravioli dish looked messy and rushed. Reminds me of Chef Boyardee canned raviolis (except bigger) that when you microwave them the sauce splatters everywhere on the plate. 

As for dessert, we shared a cannoli. That was good but seemed a bit soft on the shell. Not sure if it was pre-made so it was starting to get soggy or just a softer shell recipe but not the crunchy cannoli I was expecting. 

We live close to Vegas and go every few months. We will probably not got go here again. I prefer Gordon Ramsay's Fish and Chips, and so does my debit card."}
{"text":"We came for dinner before seeing Human Nature.  I didn't watch the Cake Boss show but I knew about it and wanted to try the restaurant.  We were early and they were still serving lunch so we ordered an appetizer so we could order off the dinner menu.

We got an order of Nina's mozzarella en carozza.  It was like having a toasted cheese sandwich with mozzarella cheese with some tasty marinara.  It was very good.  We shared the order and each had two wedges.

For our mains, my wife ordered  Nonna's lasagna.  It came with beef, pork, sausage, and four kinds of cheese and it was huge.  We could have split this between the two of us had we known how large it would be.  It probably weighed a pound at the very least and it was very good.  We brought 2/3 of it home and have it frozen for a meal for the two of us.

I got the Sunday Gravy.  How could I not go with his signature dish.  It's meatballs, sausage, lamb, and pork simmered in a Sunday gravy and served with a bowl of rigatoni.  The rigatoni was a sensible serving size, but when you added all the meat, this also was a dish that could have been shared.  This dish is worth the praise it gets from reviewers.  The Sunday gravy is excellent and the meat is so tender from the hours of cooking in the gravy!  Saving room for dessert, we opted to have part of this boxed also.

For dessert, we wanted something small and went with our server's recommendation of the Nutella Cake, cake with a warm Nutella center, chocolate sauce, some praline crunch, and served with salted caramel ice cream.  It was delicious and perfect to share at the end of the meal.

Our server, Graciela, was a gem.  She was around often to check on us.  The bus people refilled iced tea glasses quickly,  Service was very good!  The only drawback was the large Palazzo sign along the Boulevard which was at the level of the windows and was extraordinarily bright.  They have a shade which was partially lowered but it should have been lowered more or we should have changed our seating position at the table so our backs were toward the sign.

A very pleasant evening in a really good restaurant!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming brunch. Limited selection of dishes and desserts. Best part is the appetizer bar with very fresh green olives and thinly sliced cold meat. Small fresh carrots/veggie bar at the kids section were also quite refreshing. Friendly service but won't come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for my birthday dinner on August 22nd and I can not express how wonderful our meal and service was. The food was so delicious as well as the dessert. Our server Peter was so kind, helpful, knowledgeable of the menu and provided excellent recommendations. The manager Emily was so sweet and made us feel so welcomed! Over all it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. They truly made us feel so special. I can't wait to go back. Thank you Peter, Emily and the whole team at Buddy V's"}
{"text":"The meatball sliders and sausage sliders were very tasty. The bread on the sliders  melted in your mouth... The Nutella Cake was great, especially with the ice cream it came with. The manager Shawn, was so nice and  professional and made sure we had good service. He gave us a complimentary dessert because they were short staffed."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was ok. We had a group of 10 people eating for dinner. The waiter argued with us when we didn't order what he thought we should order, Including drinks. At the end of the meal he wouldn't separate our checks. He said that they couldn't do separate checks, but after We had to figure out each persons portion of payment he took everyone's cards. Made no sense. Would not recommend to a big group."}
{"text":"I had a reservation for 930 and the hostess was just crawling each time she took somebody to a table she was gone for at least 5 minutes.. I don't entirely blame her I would probably have a bad attitude if I was all by myself on a Friday night . The part that really mad me mad was that there were 2 managers just standing around doing nothing. When I asked one of the managers if he could help he said we had to wait for the the hostess and he couldn't help us. When we finally did get seated we were sat in the bar. That would of been fine but in the bar they had one waiter to take care of the entire bar area while the two managers sat and ate at the bar. The food took for ever and they even showed up with the wrong food for my mother and that took 15 minutes to get her food while we starred at are food till she got hers .the food was just alright and way over priced. I was disappointed"}
{"text":"Spaghetti and meatballs are amazing, reminds me of my grandfathers cooking. The fresh warm bread melts in your mouth. Definitely a must try while in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"brought my family for the Sunday brunch which we have enjoyed many times before. The food...still outstanding...the service...mediocre at best. the host actually made us choose at the hostess stand if my family wanted brunch or A La Carte before we sat. when i suggested we choose at the table..\"No..I do it this way\". Then the pay me no mind severs refilling all our drinks wrong takes away from the overall experience. Still, the best \"East Coast\"  Italian food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch buffet on Sunday. Great food and well worth the price. Came hungry and left full and happy. I would recommend it to anyone staying at The Venetian or Palazzo hotels."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow but the food is pretty good for the price; Bolognese was our favorite!"}
{"text":"Really lovely restaurant -- once you find it!  We asked four employees and most looked puzzled!  We eventually got there and settled in for happy hour -- which lasts till 6:30 pm. Great deal -- $4 wine/proseco/sangria and $5 appetizers.  We enjoyed the calamari, meatballs, and mac n cheese (it was delicious).

Headed to the front desk at 6 pm for our dinner reservation and they assigned us a table right outside the open kitchen hub.  When I requested something quieter?  She walked me back to the bar area!  First I was a little annoyed -- why did I make a reservation if I'm still in the bar?  But turns out it was for the best, a quiet window table in the bar area with a view of the strip.  Perfect.  We were able to order another round of happy hour drinks and their pre-theater menu for $38 pp!

Opting for light choices, we had the tomato soup, salmon, and cannoli.  Salmon was cooked perfectly and the cannoli was a perfect ending.

Both servers in the bar were EXCELLENT, friendly, and attentive.

Sadly, our only disappointment was the quality of the happy hour drinks.  The chardonnay was very dry, which is great for some people, but the big issue was the sulfites in the wines.  Really didn't enjoy the chardonnay or the proseco.

Otherwise, lovely restaurant with good food and great service!"}
{"text":"Holy hell. The food here is amazing. If you're here for the weekend, the brunch buffet is the best. As for weekdays, any entree is great although i always go with the steak. Their tomato soup is to die for and it's one of the best Italian restaurants I've been too."}
{"text":"Wow, not sure where to begin because there were so many amazing aspects to our buffet brunch! Part of the reason we decided to check out this spot was because of the amazing drink special. We were sold on the $14.95 for bottomless drinks, thinking that the food would be a run of the mill Vegas buffet. Our group of 9 ended up arriving pretty late to our reservation due to traffic and the navigation of the hotel. Our waiter, Charlie, couldn't have been more understanding and cool about it. When we ordered our drinks, we found out that with the special you could switch your drink at anytime. Because of that, our boy Charlie was generous with keeping a mixture of carafes on the table, and kept them flowing! Once we actually got started on the buffet.... Wow. Everything was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend the Mac and Cheese (it was on my plate every single time!)  Overall for the price of the buffet/drinks and the actual quality of the food, this place is a steal! I cannot wait to come back the next time I'm in Vegas. I also hope to have Charlie as a waiter again, because his helpful and sweet attitude really just enhanced the entire experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here in late June 2017 in between lunch/dinner crowd. We were seated and our waiter was spot on (not hovering but available whenever needed). I had seen Eggplant Parm on the lunch menu but noted it was not on the \"Sunset\" menu (3-5pm) and our waiter responded he thought they could manage that but said he couldn't promise...but he delivered. OMG...it was DIVINE!!! It was the perfect balance of crispy eggplant on the outside and not too squishy on the inside. My husband got the Spaghetti Pomodoro - it was delicious. But, honestly, it was the Caesar Salad that was even more memorable. My husband took a bite of the \"crouton\" and told me I had to try it. Well, it was polenta squares that were deep-fried. WOW! It transformed the salad to something we had never experienced. Their Acai Mojito was great, too. Impressive and memorable!"}
{"text":"Came in valentines day weekend for a 7:30 reservation. I was worried that they'd be slammed and food would take a while. Pleased to say that was NOT the case at all.
Our server and bus boy were very attentive, made great recommendations and took good care of us. 
We are Las Vegas locals that braced the traffic and tourists to come check this place out because we are big cake boss fans. It was well worth it! 
I think their Mac n cheese was my favorite. It's hard to tell. It was so good we couldn't help ourselves, SO FULL!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10, overall consensus was that we expected it to be better but glad that the prices weren't steep. 

I had the spaghetti and meatballs, the pasta was perfect consistency but the sauce was a bit runny and the meatballs nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quiet place to do a web meeting during my trip and saw this place so I stopped in.  I took a seat on the couches in the bar area and quickly ordered an ice tea and some cannoli.  Once my meeting started, the server checked in on me quietly once or twice to refill my ice tea.  I didn't realize that he didn't know I was in my meeting already.  Oops.  Anyway, this was a nice place to sit and relax away from the crowds in the shops area.  The cannoli was a treat, which I enjoyed one and took the other back to my hotel for a late night snack.  I'll have to try Buddy V's place again so I can check out the whole menu next time."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie the cake boss annoys the crap out of me but we decided to try this restaurant for a few reasons: proximity to our hotel, cuisine, and price point. Well, everything was delicious and service was outstanding! Highly recommend for Italian comfort food (red sauce menu) that won't cost a fortune. Bartender was so nice and attentive, we decided to eat at the bar instead of wait for our table. Enjoyed this meal much more than the $$$$ dinner we had the night before."}
{"text":"I'm never entirely happy with my brunch choices in Vegas, possibly because we pay so much and my standards then are equally high. Buddy V's fulfilled my brunch expectations and was trully wonderful. Each bite was amazing! I will absolutely come back on our next visit. Don't leave Vegas without coming here, and specifically Sunday Brunch. Try everything!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was the best, funny and point. We were there around 8pm. Place was packed. Once waiter took our order it long to get our food. The food was ok. I ordered the Lasagne it was good. I had better.  Their portiions are big. I was not able to eat half of it. Also to heavy to have this late. I could not sleep.
The desserts were very good. I will for sure be back for the desserts."}
{"text":"The portions are large enough to share...which allows you to share and try more. The service was just fine. It wasn't the best meal I've ever had but fed not the worse... If your in the area stop by but I wouldn't make my way over here just for Buddy Vs"}
{"text":"Cake Boss Restraunt? Really?!? Yes. Bunt cake tins and rolling pins decoration. Not bad. They even got a good Dogfish IPA on tap!! Yay!!!! 
Pasta aldente. Look. I'm not Italian but I consider this home cooking by any standard.  I had the veal. Good stuff. 
Pricey but you are in the canal shops (whatever).
Service great! I'll come back!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that if you come here without trying the calimari you are making a mistake.. In fact you will want to come hungry and order more than one because you may not want to share... I ordered the smashed meatball sandwich with parmigian fries.. This was a 10! Great flavor and healthy portion size. I haven't been this pleasantly surprised by a meal in a long time. 2 thumbs way up to buddy v's"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, service and food. Meat and Cheese plate to start. Meatballs and chicken Parmesan to follow. Mac and cheese melts in your mouth. I only wish they had spoons so I could get every last drop off the plate. Family oriented for the afternoon and adult ready for the evening. Desert is steps away Carlo's Bake Shop. Our server (William aka Raspberry) was excellent. Worth the $."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food, great prices. The chicken parm, will fill you up! Love the garlic bread!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple times already. Perfect date spot. Great customer service! The food is just like my friends mother's cooking back in Jersey! The pasta was cooked perfectly. I wasn't surprised with the dessert but his bakery across the restaurant is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Overall love this place! When I come to Vegas I have to come here to eat Grandma's Meatballs and Cannolis for desert. Great service. Is a little pricey but a good option is Happy Hour 4:30-6:30pm everyday in the bar and lounge."}
{"text":"Wow. We stopped in for some lunch here and our expectations were nothing short of exceeded. We ended up having a few appetizers. The eggplant and fried motz (not on menu)  and some ceaser salad. It was fresh and flavorful. Down to the croutons on the salad everything was crafted perfectly. We were gonna go grab dessert next door and the bakery and we're glad we didnt. Our enthusiastic server named Georgio recommended us to have the dessert there. They brought us the desert menu which was adorable like a photo album with family photos in it as well. They had what we would have gotten next door and served it garnished with extra cream and chocolate and even fresh fruit. This place is a must to stop in."}
{"text":"Went here last week with my girls and was blown away literally! They had a cute lil jazz band which was a unexpected surprise. They played right up until we got our main course so it was perfect timing. We split the caesar salad 3 ways and it was enough since we had the hot delicious focaccia bread with it. This is the best caesar salad I've ever had because of the warm polenta bites instead of croutons! Who knew a caesar salad could be exciting to eat?? I got the chicken rigatoni alla vodka sauce...OMG! sooo much flavor. I was full but kept eating it because it was soo good! Definitely have to come back to try the other dishes. One of the girls got the scallops which looked beautiful but wasn't too filling. The other one got the carbonara which she loved. The ambiance was perfect. Didnt have a long wait. Definitely a 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"Muy buen servicio, llegamos sin reserva y nos dieron buena mesa con vista al strip. Los platos son demasiado grandes se podrían compartir para poder probar postres que es por lo que se conoce más a buddy y cómo está Carlos bakery allí enfrente puedes aprovechar.
En las paredes hay fotos de la familia sobre la historia de cómo comenzó la empresa familiar, muy buen toque"}
{"text":"I got here at 9:15 after walking about 2 miles for them to tell me fully committed to reservations for the evening never coming back horrible management"}
{"text":"Great service, customer service was excellent, the manager on duty was amazing she went above and beyond for our party of 10. 

We did wait over 20 mins but the manager and the server sure did make up it."}
{"text":"I took my husband to Buddy V's for his birthday and we LOVED IT! Great service. Their lasagna / raviolis / spaghetti were delicious and the garlic bread they brought was the BEST. Plus, afterwards we were able to walk across the way to Carlos' bakery for desserts."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurants I have bet been too. From the moment we walked in, service was spectacular! They were so on it and sweet!! The food was amazing!!!! I mean to die for!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Excellent service! The chicken parm was wonderful! The cannolis were awesome as always!"}
{"text":"There are too many Italian restaurants on the strip or in the Venetian for that matter to waste your time here. Service was kinda crappy. I was severely underwhelmed by the lunch menu and felt like I was at universal studios at buca di beppo. Tourist trap. 3 stars because it wasnt bad and price was fine. Just not great and certainly not worth trying while in Vegas. Oh and the entrees are splitable despite their up sale attempts. Again think buca's"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the lasagna and the chicken parm. I'm not a fan of canollis, but these were especially good. Also enjoyed the Italian bday cake dessert."}
{"text":"We had a 5:30 dinner reservation but had to wait to be seated.  Not sure why, because the place had lots of empty seats.  The service was good and the food excellent.  We ordered the shrimp scampi which was made with a tomato base sauce and caesar salad.  The croutons were very different...they were served arm with cheese filled inside of these huge croutons.  It was very delicious!!  The breadsticks in packages in a holder on the table were also delicious.  We wished we stayed for the lobster dessert, but we were too filled.   We will be back the next time we're in Vegas visiting."}
{"text":"The service was GREAT right from the start.  The host immediately had the authority after walking us to our table to honor a request to sit at table adjacent that was bring swept as this was a window view table.  No hesitation, she asked for a minute to have table swept and immediately prepared. 

The waiter and the support staff immediately started service even with a full house.  Great team work for service.  

Fresh bread and olive oil was nice.  The meatballs are worth it just to dip the bread.  Kid's spaghetti was high quality and nice with the meatballs to start.  Pasta perfectly cooked.  Caesar was large enough to share with 3 and a real Caesar dressing.  It was really good with unique croutons.  

The Brocalini was great.  But the lasagna was best and perfect.  The wines are appropriate and match nice.

Prices are very reasonable considering location and level of service. The service team was great and a joy.  They treated my daughter with respect and wasn't condescending despite her age, 6 years. 

I'm very dissappointed at myself for bypassing this place all my previous trips to Vegas.  This is now my go to place for Italian on the strip.  Very homey and tasty.  Really high quality and straight forward.  Nothing complex needed."}
{"text":"Great restraunt. Great place, The meals are huge! 

 I went there for my 33erd Birthday and was stuffed. The Granny meatballs were great. If you love meatballs you gotta try them on your visit. Also the calamari is a great dish as an appetizer very good. 

Chicken parm was a good dish too but if I go again I'm getting the lasagna.."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect except it was extremely loud. And our souvenir glasses. 
We ordered the drinks in very nice souvenir glasses. We usually do this at all the tourist places that offer this. We thought our daughters would love them. They love watching the cake boss. Usually they will bring you a new glass wrapped up and you're set. 
When we got back from our trip we gave the boxes to our daughters and they opened them and here they were the glasses we drank out of and had beer residue and lemonade residue in it. How embarrassing. The beer one smelled so bad. I thought we were getting new glasses. They could have at least washed them. Good thing we gave them to our kids and not someone else. They were horribly dirty. 
Our Server was explaining the appetizers and I heard absolutely nothing he said. 
We were sat at a small table for two and I maybe said 5 words the whole time. Because it was too hard to carry on a conversation. 
It was our last night in Vegas and I wanted something romantic and memorable. 
When I think of Italian food I think romantic and intimate. 
It was not. That's the only thing I didn't enjoy. 

Food and drinks were amazing."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas for several days and headed to the strip looking for a dining establishment...just because we were in Las Vegas.  Now here is the problem for one that does not know Las Vegas...it can be very overwhelming by the selection of dining establishments and trying to walk to / find another option than those in the casio/hotel complex you are in, can be challenging given the distances involved.  We were in the Venetian and enjoyed walking along the Grand Canal.  And we ended up at Buddy V's and very glad we did.  Unfortunately it was a Friday night and there was a 90 minute wait for a table.  There was seating in the bar / lounge area and it shares the same dinner menu, so off we went.  

Ordered the $40 price fix menu which included an appy, entree, and dessert.  I selected the caesar salad, chicken parmesan and for dessert, the cannoli.  I will start with the good.  The chicken parmesan is good, really good...nicely breaded and covered with a nice tangy tomato sauce then melted cheese.  The cannoli was okay...very rich and a nice end to a dinner.  The portion size of both were quite large and one will not leave hungry.  Unfortunately there was no taste to the caesar salad dressing and the polenta croutons were simply awful...really terrible.  I had higher expectations for their caesar salad.

Our server was pleasant and attentive and the food was brought out fairly promptly after each course.

All in all, it was a positive food experience and happy to recommend Buddy V's...just not their caesar salad."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal ! One of only 2 restaurant that I would recommend in Vegas. I ordered off the lunch express menu which gives you a 3 course meal for $22. I had the meatballs for an app. You get 3 in a small boat of gravy (pasta sauce ) And they were spot on east coast Italian meatballs. They use the holy trinity of meat which is hard to find on the west coast and the sauce can't be beat . This is the kind of sauce that makes me want to step up my game because it Puts my gravy to shame !! For the meal I ordered the bucatini carbonara - again it knocks your socks off. The pasta is cooked perfectly , pancetta is crispy and the sauce light and creamy.. Simple and elegant . For dessert I ordered the tiramisu which came in a 2 oz canning jar and 3 lady fingers .. What a divine way to end a perfect meal. As a side note my husband ordered the 3 course meal as well. He ate it before I could get a pic , and I didn't get to try anything he ordered except his dessert . So we will have to take his word for it when he says the tomato basil soup was fantastic , and his chicken Parmesan  was the best he's ever had . He stated that the chicken had a light breadcrumb coating (he hates when it's thick like some sort of chicken bird sweater )  and his side of spaghetti was cooked perfect and served with the same type of sauce as my meatballs . For his dessert he ordered the cannoli.. Oh holy cannoli was that amazing!! I ended up eating it for him as he is lactose intolerant .. A good wife would have explained that cannoli are stuffed with marscapone cheese ! But.... Here we are .."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant! Great vibe, great food and even better people! The food was fresh and incredible! Especially the croutons! The wine selection is great. Service is great. And to top it off, we got to meet the Cake Boss himself."}
{"text":"I made reservations mid afternoon on Wednesday for our group of ten.  We were seated shortly after arriving and got sat next to a noisy group.  Our waiter was able to project his voice to go over some of his favorites on the menu.  We ended up ordering two orders of the salumi and cheese board.  I am allergic to fennel and was assured by the waiter that pasta dish I ordered was in the clear.  Several in the group ordered the  Sunday gravy and were in heaven.  The chicken Parmesan was also a hit (a dish I had on my first visit several months ago). One couple in the group ordered the  waiters favorite grandmas meatballs.  The bread and oil/vinegar was amazing as always.  The group was really impressed with the service we had.  Six of them had never been before.  They were very happy with our pick for dinner our first night in vegas!"}
{"text":"Very good and wonderful service. I like the decor. I feels like you're in a home and the food is very filling. It is like a home cooked Italian meal. Great experience and good food. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing staff, worth every penny and not expensive.  Chicken Picatta is to die for!  Absolutely love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was excellent! Every single dish we ordered was superb!!! The pastas were perfectly portioned and flavorful. The portions were huge. And most importantly the customer service was excellent. 

I ordered the chicken parmesan. At first I was very hesitant because EVERYTIME I order chicken parmesan the chicken is dry and junk. However, I got the $40 special that comes with salad, an entree and a dessert... so out of the entree selections I chose the chicken parmesan and boy did i absolutely enjoy it!! The chicken breast was soooo tender and juicy. They put a nice amount of cheese on top too. I wish they gave a little more noodles, but that's okay. They give two chicken slices and each slice was huge. So good!!


I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who values food Italian food!"}
{"text":"Like I said about the bakery, this place symbolizes overrated businesses glamorized by the media for no justifiable reason:

The spaghetti my sister ordered was extremely sour and the flavor was disgusting. One bite of it and my insides starting screaming. Mid-way through the meal, my sister needed to use the restroom.. for a while. 

My margherita pizza? Equivalent to the taste and thickness of a napkin. Zero flavor and toppings spread so thin, they must have evaporated upon baking.

After dinner, I left it to Lisa's Nutella Cake with Salted Caramel ice cream to save Buddy V's reputation. I mean, there's no way someone can mess those flavors up - the title alone is perfect. I was wrong. Overly sweet, dense, rich - one bite was too much (and must have contained at least 75g of sugar). The ice cream had nothing salted or caramel about it. I am a huge lover of desserts - and this made me so so sad.

Summary:
+long wait, pricey, not good - Why would you come here?"}
{"text":"AFFORDABLE DELICIOUS BUFFET! We did the Sunday brunch Buffet the weekend after Thanksgiving (2015). This was one of the cheaper buffets in Vegas. Cheap in price ($34.95 per perosn), but not in quality that is. The food was delicious and there was such a good variety of Italian food, breakfast food, seafood, desserts & fruit. Not to mention, it wasn't your typically fruit you find in your local market. The garlic cheese bread was Heaven! The pasta dishes were great as well. The seafood was fresh and great quality. Honestly, I'm not a big fan on buffet's but this was a great way to try out several of the dishes at this restaurant. ALSO...The pianist really added to the ambiance of the place. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Enjoyed the bread & oil.  Strong drink menu.  Portions are good. White tablecloth place - though priced medium for the Vegas strip.  Hits that sweet spot, where a couple *can* dine for $60 + tax/ tip.  

Based upon strong portions, I highly recommend splitting with your dining companion (easier to do on romantic getaway than conference with \"the work guys!\")

On our visit in Dec., 2016, we split: calamari (good flavor), meatballs (yessir!) and chicken piccata.  This latter option had the most absolutely delicious pasta i have EVER HAD.  So much so, that despite the $7 addition, I asked the waiter for an extra side.  Huge mistake: by the time the kitchen made it, my tummy was starting to bloat.

But this is Vegas baby, so we still visited the bakery counter across the way!  One observation: they are really strict/ serious about the Happy Hour ONLY in the bar. As i recall, they were equally adamant that we would have to \"move tables\" to the main dining area (4 feet away) to order off the regular menu.  We didn't fuss with it.  You've been warned : - )

Would return !"}
{"text":"Truly impressive restaurant with Strip view. 
I've been coming to Buddy Vs for a few years now. No weekend trip to Vegas has been complete for me without Sunday brunch here. Their Bruch buffet features high quality breakfast and lunch dishes, fresh premium fruits, cheese, Italian cold cuts and best of all: the desert bar. The service has always been good and the overall value is reasonable for a major resort Strip front restaurant. 
Today I came for regular lunch. We ordered the salami and cheese platter, spaghetti Bolognese and tiramisu. As always, the food was outstanding. The three cheeses and three meats were of the finest quality and paired with freshly open-fire grilled garlic butter feloni bread. The Bolognese, while a simple dish, has always been one of our favorites here, as they do it perfectly. Saving the best for last, the tiramisu by itself is worth coming here for (and it's served as part of the Sunday brunch buffet as well !!). I also loved their new coffee from Fonte, which is a perfect pair with the tiramisu. 
The weeks before Christmas are always slow, so we were able to get a table by the window with excellent Strip view. Danny did an outstanding job taking care of us and making this a truly enjoyable lunch at one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"While in Las Vegas for Xmas we decided to check this spot out after checking their reviews which were great, We ordered several dishes and was very happy we made a reservation at this restaurant. Great food and great service. I enjoyed the Chicken Parm with a salad and a Shrimp pasta dish. Everything was excellent they had a buffet at the time we arrived but we opted out to order individual dishes instead. The restaurant has a great decor and the staff service was great."}
{"text":"Made dinner reservations before going to see the Fortunate Son in Concert.  The cheese bread is good, and I am not a big fan of cheese.  I ordered the linguini  and clam sauce and my wife got the spaghetti with meat balls. We topped it off with the Apple pie ala mode."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had some pasta that had chicken and a vodka sauce.  I desperately wished I had ordered that instead of the scallops.  The scallops I had were seared pretty nicely and had capers around them for some saltiness, but I kinda wished I had salt or something besides mashed potatos with them.  Mashed potatos and scallops kinda don't go together in my head.  Anyways, his food was so good I kept eating off his plate and he kept letting me because I'm his girlfriend so he has to...  The calamari was also okay.  Compared to Nora's it wasn't that great but if you aren't a spoiled brat then yeah, the calamari is Ok.  I also had the nutella cake with icecream and that was Ok too.  The icecream was raved about by my server last night, and he told me that it is the same icecream as Honeysalt.  I thought I had had it before!!!  I didn't care for the cake so much and just picked out the Nutella.  I don't know why I got that because I can have Nutella at home.  I should have gotten some different dessert.  I will know now for next time to get the pasta and get a different dessert.  That dang vodka sauce and pasta was SO good."}
{"text":"Always have heard about this place so my husband and i decided to check it out. Service was great...but the back waiter was right on. He pretty much took care of everything. My husband had thr shrimp scampi he said it was ok nothing to brag about. There was not much of a robust flavor to it and the pasta was very starchy as in they didnt rinse it very well. I had the Caprese salad and I have to admit that it was amazing. We also had the meatballs which were tasty. The garlic bread was ok but not fond of the cheese on it. The atmosphere was laid back which was nice. We sat in the bar area because there werent any seats available in the dining area.

So I give this place 3 stars because it wasnt amazing but it always wasnt that bad. Average i would say. Minus that Caprese salad that was amazing."}
{"text":"Was visiting Vegas & leaving on Sunday so I knew I couldn't do the brunch but I checked the facebook & saw they were doing the \"Sunday Brunch\" on Saturday now & was so excited! We had the best experience, from the amazing food to the wonderful service. The cannoli I see on TV were so worth it & the red velvet cake, wow! We are definitely making this a Vegas tradition!"}
{"text":"I used to watch Cake Boss. While I haven't seen an episode in recent times, I recall not only being amazed by Buddy Valastro's cake designs, but wishing I could try some of those hearty Italian meals that he and his family would cook up as well. I finally had my chance to try both the sweet and savory while my husband and I vacationed in Las Vegas. 

Buddy V's restaurant and Carlo's Bakery are right across the way from each other inside The Venetian. The line for the bakery was a mile long, so we opted to have lunch and enjoy one of the desserts in the restaurant instead. I loved the feel of the place. It was cozy and warm with large windows to view the gorgeous strip. 

They serve warm focaccia bread with olive oil to start. It was so light and fluffy... We both asked for a second piece even though we promised each other we would save room for that dessert! They offer a prix fix lunch special for $22, which is what my husband ordered. You can choose from a few slightly smaller portions of appetizers or salads, entrees or pastas, and desserts. He went with the meatballs, chicken parmesan, and cannoli. I had the whole wheat penne primavera, which included all sorts of tasty grilled veggies. My husband split his cannoli with me... I really didn't give him a choice. :p It was stuffed with sweet ricotta and dipped in chocolate chips and pistachio. Not to diss my hometown of St. Louis, known for its Italian foods and restaurants, but this was the absolute best cannoli I've ever had in my life! 

My husband and I both left Buddy V's completely satisfied and determined that we would definitely return on our next trip. Thankfully, we visit Vegas often, so I shouldn't have to wait too long for another cannoli!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: 

Last night in Las Vegas, for this trip. It was uncertain room service, Table Ten or????? Well I went back to Buddy's. Sat at the bad this time. Again the service (Danny) was stellar, the food was delicious and again, I ate too much and had no room for dessert. Gonna miss this place! 

Staying at the Palazzo we saw a show about the owner, his love for desserts. We checked it and thankful that we did. The restaurants pretty spacious but not a whole lot of tables yet we were able to get a reservation for two. Service was top-notch full bar there's enough there to please everybody. We ate so much from bread, salad to entree that it's a shame we didn't save room for desserts. What were we thinking! I feel like we got robbed by our own decision to eat it all because it was so good. 

Guess it means we have to go back! Great wine selection too!"}
{"text":"Went twice during my stay in Vegas and I must say, Buddy V's has great service. 

It also has an awesome happy hour with their yummy calamari with fried green peppers coming in at $5. Such a steal especially for a place like this. The meatball sliders were yummy and I enjoyed the sauce of the mac n cheese but it was definitely more sauce than pasta.  Sangria was also delicious and affordable.

Next time I know not to come for dinner though. The pastas were just okay and I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"What a great happy hour menu! $4 drinks and $5 apps every night from 4:30-6:30. Really great service from friendly bartender named Tawny and cool live music playing Sinatra, Bennett, etc.

Can be comfortable in jeans or more dressy.  

You won't be disappointed. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is some quality, authentic Italian food on the Vegas strip. The service was semi snooty when it came to strollers and an extra chair at the table, but overall it was fine. Try to get a seat near the window it's a nice view of the Wynn water show area."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the cake boss and when I found out that he opened a restaurant I was over the moon. Good parts the food and portions are excellent, the price is pretty comparable considering it is on the Vegas strip. Unfortunately the service was horrible!!!!! The server never paid attention to her tables. It took a lot to get refills on drinks, our check, and our change. She didn't even check our table to see if our meal was tasting ok. I will go back for the food, just hope they can fix the service."}
{"text":"In Vegas, never sure if you will be gouged by high prices and mediocre food and service. This place delivers high quality on all aspects. Food was delicious. Prices reasonable. But most of all ... The SERVICE. Wow!! Nailed it!  We dine out 3 times a week (let's face it, I have no business being in a kitchen) and this experience has been by far, one of our best. Georgio, out server ... Hats off to you. Thank you for providing is a welcoming and phenomenal dining experience. And Alex ... A busboy ... Another wow in our books!! Nicely done gentlemen!"}
{"text":"We just got back from Las Vegas and I am still thinking of the meal I had at this restaurant.  We went for a birthday celebration so we made reservations.  I was skeptical because I am very critical of Italian food because I am married to an Italian.  I ordered the Sunday gravy with meatballs pork lamb and sausage.   The dish was fantastic.  Gravy was just as good as homemade sauces I have had.  I will definitely order again.  I probably will share with hubby because entrees are Hugh.  The waitress was accommodating and even allowed us to split the check.  I hope one opens up in Houston soon."}
{"text":"Saturday brunch was fantastic! Be sure to try sunday style eggs, veggie fritatta, and meatballs."}
{"text":"APPS: 
MAC AND CHEESE CARBONARA
MEATBALL

ENTREE:
VEAL CHOP PARMESAN

everything was amazing!! With all the different Italian restaurants and being this was the last dinner we had in vegas it was hard to choose but so glad we came here! Meatballs were scrumptious, carbonara was rich and decadent and the veal Parmesan was so tender and perfectly fried....veal chop was huge hubby and I shared the entree and it was perfect, and of course the pasta was perfect as well. Will def be back to eat here when we return to vegas."}
{"text":"If you like the Olive Garden and Buca Di Peppo then you'll love this place.  if your idea if a good Italian meal is something you'd get in a large northeastern city, you'll find this place very average"}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite places to eat when we are in Vegas,, service is great and the food has always been amazing. Highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"The pasta is fresh and  I love that.  The meatballs are flavorful and really do taste homemade, like mom used to make.  The cannoli for dessert, which my husband loves, tasted good to me too, even though I just had one bite.  I do not like cannoli but I sure liked theirs!  The service was horrible.  Absolutely positively horrible.  Nice people, don't get me wrong, but horrible service.  The \"bread guy\" needed to be told what to do in his job but why couldn't he remember on his own you fill up the water glasses and you keep offering the focaccia?  The waiter was sure to tell me that it was his helper's 19th birthday, but who cares?  Do your job and party later.  The floor manager with the dark black hair and who I believe was dressed too casually for this type of price point restaurant wasn't doing much of anything.  He barely looked up from his texting while showing a waitress what he was texting and laughing about to mumble \"Good night.\".  Help your waiters out man!  Be a team! I believe the waiters have too many tables to be able to give you the service you deserve for paying those \"on the strip\" prices.  My hubby did state his linguini with white clam sauce was not flavorful at all.  He ended up asking for a lot of cheese on top, which you have to wait for also since it is not on the table.  Don't be cheap Buddy, put the cheese on the table!"}
{"text":"A dream come true after watching Carlo's Bakery on TV for years.  Service was good and food was amazing from the bread to the entree to dessert.  Had Madeline's Whole Wheat Penne and then Cannoli for dessert.  Just as good as I had hoped it would be.  Clever interior with rolling pins hanging and whisks on the light fixtures.  Family photo album in the dessert menu.  Great option for getting dessert since the bakery across the hall is always so busy."}
{"text":"!!!So good I tipped the Chef responsible for my Chicken Parm plate $20!!!
 It was the best spaghetti I've had. Not the typical American style spaghetti swimming in sauce. It was true Italian full flavored perfection. Service was very good and attentive as well."}
{"text":"Had chicken parmesan and it was amazing, big, thin, lightly breaded and juicy. We also had grandma's meatballs which were great as well.

I'm def coming back here next time im in vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chicken parm in Vegas!

I think celebrity chefs restaurants get a bad rap on occasion just because a lot of Yelpers don't want to appear \"trendy\". Buddy V's, IMHO, could be named BLANK and have the crowds it does based on their food alone. As my Uncle used to say when he called us to the table at one of his BBQ's, \"It's real good and there's lots of it!\". Great service and views along with great Italian food gets 5 stars from me.

WHEN YOU GO- Reservations at night are a must! I recommend lunch and a window seat!"}
{"text":"Our family had a great meal here last night. The only problem we had was the waiter pushing everything but what we were ordering, pushing us towards the more expensive items on the menu. Making us feel guilty for not ordering dessert. 

The food was amazing and filling,"}
{"text":"Fique decepcionada que não era dia do buffet. Não sabia que era no domingo. Entrada gostosa. Prato principal pasta e lasanha muito gostosa. Ambiente vintage. Bom atendimento."}
{"text":"Brought my family in for my birthday dinner this past Sunday night. Great experience from service to food! The hostess was very friendly, our server was very educated on the menu items, the manager (Sean) stopped at our table and asked how everything was. All in all, we felt very well taken care of. My wife is also in the restaurant industry and she could tell that the managers pay very close attention to up keeping the service standards. Highly recommended for special occasions or just a great dinner out with the family!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! I'm sorry I don't remember my waiters name but he was super nice and made great recommendations. The panzenella salad is a must try. Beautiful restaurant, amazing food and atmosphere. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Spaghetti was the overwhelming choice at the table and it was worth it.  The sauce is not a strong tomato taste as most Italian restaurants, almost had a light cream added to it.  The meat was perfect.  A lot of crumbled beef on the sauasage.   Excellent.  

Would have been 5 stars with better service.  It seems to be a common theme in Vegas, mediocre service at the restaurants.  I think we asked for coffee 7-8 times before being served.  Just not very attentive and no sense of urgency.  

5 star food and 3 star service gets you 4 stars."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience overall, the service was great, the view was beautiful. The only thing I didn't like was that the menu was very limited and the food was kind of too salty, but overall it was not disgusting or anything just okay."}
{"text":"Great food . Friendly staff.  Second time here. Great desert... Yummy. Thank you Buddy V"}
{"text":"Das Restaurant ist im Hotel Venetian gelegen. 
Wir sind dort spontan aufgetaucht und haben auch ohne Reservierung noch einen Platz bekommen. 

Allerdings nur im Bereich der Bar an einem kleinen Tisch für Zwei mitten im Raum. 
Etwas ungemütlich platziert. 

Die Geräuschkulisse ist extrem anstrengend. Man muss sich ziemlich laut unterhalten. Dabei ist es egal, wo man genau sitzt, da der ganze Laden einfach laut ist. Das wird auch nicht besser, wenn die Live-Musik aus Schlagzeug und Keyboard wieder anfängt zu spielen. An der Stilrichtung der Musik ist allerdings nichts auszusetzen. 

Wie zu erwarten ist das Essen typisch italienisch. Man kann sogar zwischen der uns bekannten Bolognese-Sauce und der Soße mit Meatballs wählen. 
Wir haben die erste Variante genommen. Die Nudel waren schön al dente und die Sauce sehr lecker abgeschmeckt und mit reichlich Fleisch. Portion war auch angemessen. 

Für den Preis muss man halt Vegas-Maßstäbe ansetzen, aber immer noch erträglich. 

Abzüge gebe ich aufgrund der Lautstärke. Nach dem ganzen Trubel am Tag wäre es schön beim Essen Abends mal etwas die Ohren entspannen zu können. 
Zu beachten ist auch, dass der Laden schon um 22 Uhr schließt. Wir haben gerade noch Glück gehabt, kamen aber auch schon in den Genuss des abendlichen Aufräumend um uns rum."}
{"text":"Not sure if we were unlucky or what but our service was poor most of the evening. Starting with taking others ahead of us at the beginning. Perhaps it was the fact we had kids and they wanted to segregate us. Everyone else got bread immediately but I had to ask because the kids were hungry. Waitress really seemed preoccupied. Food was OK but nothing special. Very overpriced but I expected that on the Strip. Overall not a great experience."}
{"text":"Stopped for a few drinks and appetizers. 

Service was good. We ordered 2 specialty drinks to try something new and they were great. Mine was the sweet tea vodka drink. Yum!  I wish I had the names. 

We had the garlic bread and meatballs and they hit the spot.  The meatballs were perfect. Very tasty and not dried out. 

Would go again."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here because it was close to the theater where we were seeing a show.

We showed up 30 minutes late and they accommodated us and sat us quickly anyway.  Awesome!  Further, told the busboy that we had a show to catch and could he please tell the server we had to move fast.  Within 2 minutes, server appears to take our order to ensure that we could make our show.  Excellent!

Food:  
Garlic Bread:  Good
Buddy's Caprese:  Very Good
Chicken Rigatoni \"Alla Vodka\" :  Very Good
Valastro Sunday Gravy:  I did not try, but my friend claims it was Excellent.  In fact, he insists I write this in here because he wants to encourage others to eat it.  (He insists that others dip the Garlic Bread into the \"Gravy\".)

We had a bottle of Chianti and it was very good, as well.

Great service, great food and would definitely go again.  So thankful, they were so accommodating to our tight schedule!"}
{"text":"Food was so awesome we didn't have room to try any dessert! Get the panzanella...seriously so good. We also split lasagna and vodka rigatoni.   Wonderful and well priced for vegas!"}
{"text":"Great Place to eat!!! Wifey had me try the garlic cheese bread.....OMG!!! was so Freaking GOOD!!! Highly recommend this place. Staff was great! Service exceptional! Ask for one of (Caleb's Tables). Food Amazing! I will keep coming back any time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious-- ridiculously good-- food. We ordered the fried mozzarella appetizer, grandma's meatballs, then chicken parm, and pasta a la vodka-- SO good. We were stuffed but took a cannoli and lobster claw to go-- more crazy deliciousness. Pomegranate martini a bit to syrupy, but no big deal since everything else was perfection. Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our last dinner in Vegas at Buddy V's. The service was excellent and we were seated right away with our reservation. The live music was also enjoyable. We split a Caesar salad and the croutons were warm and stuffed! I had the orchiette pasta and my husband had the chicken parm. Both entrees were big portions. I recommend getting a table next to the window so you can enjoy the view of the strip."}
{"text":"Buddy V's is a great place for Italian food!  We recently took my daughter, son and grandson there and all of them enjoyed it.  Lots to look at inside and we were kind of close to a window overlooking the strip.  My wife and I get the grandma's meatballs and the garlic bread.  And we were thoroughly satisfied.  The spaghetti my daughter got was very good also.  The only thing that was bizarre  was when our server asked to move the baby seat that was sitting on a chair, bothering no one, to the floor.  My son responded, \"whatever is good for you..I guess.\"  Whatever.   Food was good so we overcame the weird request."}
{"text":"Was super excited to come here being a huge lover of Italian food and a Cake Boss fan.  We were seated relatively quickly in the \"patio\" area for their happy hour.  We started off with small bites right away, but our waiter never came back to take our freaking entree order.  We sat there patiently for half an hour after finishing our appetizers.  He specifically knew we were ordering more since we said we'll start off with the appetizers and asked to leave the menu since we were still ordering an entree.  While we were waiting for him to come back, the host grabbed the menu off our table and gave it to the table next to us, without even asking if we were done. We continued waiting and were so annoyed we didn't even order more food. So after 60 minutes of waiting for them to take our order, even though we told someone to grab out waiter so we could order earlier, we just asked for the check, which took another 30 minutes.  It's not like it was busy. Maybe 25% of the restaurant was full, and they had a separate person seating, a separate person taking order, another delivering the food, and another cleaning the tables and refilling water. Not to mention he was one of like 4 waiters, and the place isn't that big.  He charged us $16 for a medium beer, which is totally fine, but other waiter told us it should've only costed us $12, and then they said just kidding.  Seems kind of steep to go from $9-small and $16-medium. I'm a waiter so I'm pretty big on tipping.  Didn't bother to tip as the service was awful. I think our waiter's name was Danny or something. The host sucked too for grabbing our menu without asking, like dude, come on.  They were middle aged people so this was most likely their full time job since we went on a Thursday. You suck at your job guys."}
{"text":"Staying at the Venetian and craved Italian without breaking the bank. Found Buddy V's thanks to yelp! Never watched Cake Boss, so didn't know anything about the celebrity status of the chef. We didn't have reservations and tried to get a table around 6:45pm on a Saturday for 2 people. Apparently there was a private event so they couldn't seat us til after 9pm, but luckily there was a table at the bar, so we took that. The bar is a bit noisier than the restaurant, but totally worth it to not wait. Before 7pm, they have a 3 course menu  for $38 which includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert. 

Loved the moist and soft Grandma's Meatball appetizer. You only get 3 and they are half dollar sized. For my entree, I got the bolognese. Absolutely delicious and extreme chunky sauce. I also loved the fact that they were very generous w/the sauce so that I actually had plenty of sauce for my pasta! Even had some sauce left over to dip a piece of bread! Got the nutella dessert and thought that it was a tad sweet. Very decadent, but just a tad sweet."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant!  Food is moderately/higher priced, but expected in a casino.  Italian food and steaks are awesome!  Drink menu is one of the best to enjoy new things!  One of the best dining experiences of my life!  We enjoyed with friends as a group of 4.  Top place and hidden gem in Sin city!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a Group. I ordered a margarita pizza and it was delicious. The pastas also looked amazing but I did not want something too heavy. The pasta sauce is well-made and the ingredients are fresh. The ambience isn't too fancy so if you're looking for a upscale Vegas dinner place this spot might not be it. It was however a great place to get in and out for lunch."}
{"text":"The food at this place is delicious. I can't say the same for the deserts though. Had the \"Lobster Tail\" and some cannolis. Baked/desert goods were  nothing special. Odd and funny as this is what Buddy is supposedly known for and yet the food was better than the bakery. Chicken Parm on point. Will be back for the food (ALONE) for sure; Next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the hype. We got calamari for an appetizer which was really good. But as for our main dishes the food was okay nothing special. Definitely needs to have more flavor and spices. We got the cannoli for desert and it was awful. The service was attentive and friendly. Wouldn't come back though."}
{"text":"The Italian food is exactly as generic as you're thinking it may be. It's a noisy environment just like you're expecting it may be. Yes it's a tourist trap type of restaurant. Yes, your teen age daughter will love it."}
{"text":"Honestly all I do is really check in to pecs now a days but decided to write a review because the food and service was so good. Ordered prosseco, lemon chicken piccata (?), and an Italian birthday cake for dessert. I NEVER eat the pasta but it was so good. I'm crying at the workouts I'm going to have to do for this. Everything here is exactly what Buddy V would want it to feel like...family. The food is homey the service people the ambience I will come back!! Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Great meal & great service. My friend & I shared the Caesar salad to start. Instead of regular croutons they were made out of polenta. The pomegranate martini was nice & tart, not sweet which it how I like them. I had the seared scallops w polenta & prosciutto. Melt in your mouth. My friend got the eggplant parm w appetizer with added meatballs & spaghetti. She enjoyed. We shared the Nutella molten cake w salted caramel ice cream. Great finish to the meal. I definitely would come back here!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best Italian food every! Everything was great. I come from a Sicilian family straight off the boat.  Just like Nona's cooking.  Would give it 10 stars if I could"}
{"text":"It was my third time in this place last Saturday so this review is long overdue (I have to go every time I'm in vegas) and again  it didn't disappoint the food is great it has this amazing home taste the place is so nice and the service is great any employee you talk too is soooo nice. I had ordered different things every time and every dish is better that the last one. And lets not forget the dessert I've got the Tiramisu every time and its the best dessert ever. I've also tried the chocolate cake and its amazing. So if you decide to go you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Went to Buddy's for Saturday brunch and it was so delicious! There was such a wide variety of good food and the service was wonderful! Would definitely recommend to anyone heading to Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Long review: First off let me start by saying this review is not about the food. The food is amazing. I've been coming here for 3 years in a row for my birthday and once for our anniversary and the food has not disappointed once. 
This is about their service. Like I stated I, with my family, having been here 3 years in a row and have received excellent service and food, until this last time in August. I originally called to reserve a table for 8 guests and a baby. I was later informed that one more person was to be added, so I called to see if I can get a bigger table. I was told I couldn't because it was a busy night for them, that maybe we could squeeze another chair, that was fine since it was for a kid. When we sat down there was so space for a car seat sling, my cousin's baby was on the floor behind her chair. The manager did not want to move us to a bigger table, which there were plenty of! The whole time we sat and ate and left there were bigger tables all around us! How is having a baby sitting in a car seat on the floor behind the chairs next to another table safe? We asked if this was a hazard or safe or a fire hazard and she kept saying no. We felt uncomfortable leaving him there (he was 2 months at the time) so my cousin had to hold him the whole time we dined. Then came time to pay. We could not do split. He la according to the waiter, the \"computer\" wouldn't let him. So we all wrote down our amounts and the card number on the back of the receipt. He then came back to say we were short. He was talking about the SUGGESTED gratuity. When then explained we would add gratuity when we signed the receipt. He said again that the \"computer\" would not let him because the total of the bill was the amount with the SUGGESTED gratuity includes. How is this even possible? My cousin tried arguing with him other wise but the waiter would not budge! He was determined to get his suggested gratuity. My cousin was getting rather upset so we budged and paid the total and walked away. Happy 30th to me! Sad to say that even though I LOVE the food here, this will no longer be my annual birthday dinner spot."}
{"text":"Had my second visit to this place this past weekend and I'm glad I made the choice to have dinner here on our last night in Vegas. 

The service was amazing. Everyone who came by the table was nice and friendly; there was a lot of personality and charm in the staff which made our time here fun! They were very attentive without being overbearing. 

Everyone loved their food. The chicken parm was a crowd favorite and I finished my shrimp scampi even though the button on my pants was about to pop off. 

Although I don't come to Vegas often because it's not my thing, I would come back here because I know the food and service will be memorable."}
{"text":"Einfach super! Für die Fleischbällchen würde ich alles geben. Wir waren zweimal dort bei ubserem Las Vegas Besuch und es war alles vom feinsten!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal , very traditional Italian offerings !  I ate the Sunday gravy special & it was perfect - just like grandma's !  The atmosphere, staff, decor was all very friendly & roomy.  If your looking for traditional Italian that's fairly priced - you found it !  I would return for sure."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to how wonderful my dinner was.  I had the Chicken Piccata, which was quite tasteful w/a lot of flavor.  The pasta that came with piccata was the best tasting pasta, yet...it had so much flavor...I can still taste it, yum.  The Eggplant Parmesan and Calamari was just as tasty.  I truly was pleased w/how flavorful each meal was.  I definitely will go back and oh...we did go to Cake Boss's bakery...wow!  I had the strawberry tower, will not disappoint you, I promise.  Loved it!
Bought their carrot cupcakes, sugar cookies and  walnut cookies...will be baaaack!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food with an awesome view! It is super cool even going into the restaurant, the ambience is like no other and the decor is perfect. Fun, loud environment, but still good for a date. Made a reservation last minute and they had no problem taking us early when we arrived. Good service, good food. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've dined here two years in a row for Restaurant Week and have been happy with both food and service. 

The service has been attentive and friendly. Both times I had reservations and was seated right away. 

On my most recent visit I started with the Caesar Salad. The salad was basic and not overly exciting, but the polenta croutons on top were tasty. The warm bread served with oil and vinegar was pretty good. 

Spaghetti and Meatballs made for a hearty, delicious lunch. The meatballs were fairly seasoned and I liked the spaghetti sauce on the dish. My friend's Chicken Parmesan was my favorite of the two dishes though. The chicken had plenty of breading and cheese. 

I'm a big dessert person and both hit the spot for me. The Cannoli had a great tasting filling with yummy chocolate chips and pistachios on one end. I just tasted the Cheesecake, but loved the flavor and I don't usually care for cheesecake.

Buddy V's is probably not my first pick for Italian in town, but a solid option if in the area. A big perk is Carlo's Bakery across the hall for more post dinner sweets."}
{"text":"Well, I wasn't feeling very hungry so ordered the Caprese salad and it was absolutely delicious! It came with heirloom tomatoes - some fresh and some were pre-marinated and slightly seasoned, almost as if they were pickled, which enhanced the depth of the flavors. The various ingredients truly came well together. The creaminess of the burrata and the fragrant basil with the tomatoes were simply perfect. I would order this dish again and again. Oh, not to mention the chargrilled garlic bread to boot!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for casual dining in Vegas. Friendly staff. Recommend the meatballs - they're a must! We also loved the caprese salad. Save room for dessert. His bakery is just across the way."}
{"text":"Best Caesar Salad I have ever had! Polenta croutons are an amazing touch. Dinner portions are small for the price but they still get 5 stars for the salad! Will be back every time I am in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service from Crystal.  The meatballs were fabulous,  ravioli was great and their tomato basil soup was excellent."}
{"text":"Decent Italian place. Nice decor. Food was tasty. Had the Margherita pizza, pretty good. Price is good considering it is in Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Delicious food, nice ambience and very good customer service. We didn't have reservation and the restaurant was busy. So we only got the table with super tall chairs. That was the only uncomfortable thing (am short). Would love to come again when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Buddy V's is like eating Sunday dinner with my Nona. The food was traditional, impeccably crafted, and amazingly delicious. The service was beyond helpful, informative, and all around pleasant. The general manager Adam, went out of his way to chat with our table and surrounding tables several times. I highly recommend this restaurant for the good and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Made lunch reservations while in Vegas! I was super excited to try Buddy's restaurant! The place was casual, not very busy and our table wasn't ready. Ok fine. We were seated and it took us 15 minutes before anyone came to us. Mind you it wasn't very busy. Finally, waitress came over and filled our glasses with water and took our order. We got our appetizer which was like breaded mozzarella, still no beverages. :/ we had to ask the bus boy for our drinks. I ordered lemon piccata, dh ordered chicken Parmesan. It was all decent, but the terribly slow service really ruined the whole experience. With so many better options I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Sunday Gravy was AMAZING!!!!.  I have had many excellent dishes at this restuarant but this was by far the best thing I have ever eaten.  Being Italian I don't understand the review that said if you want authentic Italian don't go here.....that person does not know Italian food at its best.  The Cannoli is amazing and I don't know what he is talking about."}
{"text":"Best Happy hour food, service & ambiance we've had in Vegas. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the margarita pizza, just ok, the frozen one from Vons is better, not flavored enough (bland), crust a little burnt, had the Cesar salad w/grilled shrimp, it was good, but the fresh croutons was not what I was used too, was still warm and a bit undercooked in the middle, it was very soft w some lemon or sour taste, didn't eat those, didn't mixed well with the chilled salad, also had the fresh garlic bread and tomato basil soup, this was the best! Our waiter was a Jerk, our bus guy was better then the waiter I wish I could have tipped him, I tipped the waiter but trust I didn't want too! I'm not going back, I'll stick to the bakery!"}
{"text":"Let me start with my granddaughter 
She loved this restaurant
S he had spaghetti 
See pic

Now the chicken piccata according to my daughter and her friend fell flat like a New England patriots football 

The shrimp scampi was excellent 

My son in law ate the chicken Parmesan 
He likes it because it has 2 chicken breasts
But one of our friends gave him another and he ate it
I have a strong feeling he enjoyed it

I had the meatballs and they were okay

The service  was excellent 

The ambiance was excellent"}
{"text":"Good ambience and decent prices.  The food is cooked perfectly, compliments to the chef!  And on top amazing service from our waitress and table runner (Tammy).  They did such an amazing job with getting our orders in a timely wander and making sure we had excellent service.  Two thumbs up!  A must visit in Vegas."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious! My son and I dropped by Buddy V's for lunch and really enjoyed it. We sort of expected a \"cheesy,\" chain style feeling. We were wrong!  The restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated. He had the $22 Express Lunch (he chose meatballs, chicken parm and a cannoli) and I chose the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp (included these amazing polenta croutons!). Everything was tasty and the portion sizes were filling and just right for lunch. The service was extremely friendly and attentive from the servers, hostess, busboy, etc. We look forward to visiting Buddy V's again next time we're in town and would recommend it for anyone looking for a casual, low-key, fair priced and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with the food. Everything was extremely salty. It's like they tried to make up for flavor with salt. And the service was absolutely horrible from the hostess that's nipples were showing through her see through dress to the rude waiter. This place is a def SKIP"}
{"text":"Skip the restaurant and enjoy the Bake Shop across the hall instead.

I thought this place looked interesting and who doesn't love Cake Boss so I tried them for lunch. Had a tough time find them at first. I was traveling solo and dining alone not for whimps. This place seemed to cater more towards families and was not that comfortable here; don't know how to explain it but almost like it was a bother that 1 person was taking a table. Food was average (meatball sub and tomato basil soup). Service was meh. Overall I was under impressed. Hit the bake shop up on the way out and that pretty much saved the trip. 7 layer rainbow cookies, yum!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great... Nice atmosphere great view from upstairs windows ... Service was great until dessert time then our bar/waiter got busy and forgot about us for 20 minutes and he wasn't very accommodating for being so slow to take dessert order ... Just said sorry I got busy at bar otherwise this place is great ."}
{"text":"I came in the restaurant at 3pm on Sunday. Maybe it's because of the odd hour, they are obviously short-staffed. It took them almost 10 minutes before I was greeted by a waiter and served with water. However, service aside, their food was good. I ordered Madeline's whole wheat penne, and their pesto is one of the best I have ever had, but I do think they are a bit over-priced (not by much). In general, I will rate their food 5 star, price 3 star, and service 3 star."}
{"text":"The service at Buddy V's was some of the best I've had in Las Vegas. Everything about the restaurant is very warm and welcoming. The staff are friendly and attentive without being overbearing they where knowledgeable of the Menu and made useful suggestions.
 I had the Sunday gravy it was a nice assortment of meats sausage, lamb, and pork in marinara sauce. My girlfriend had the sea bass and gave it high marks. I don't eat fish so I can't vouch for it personally. We finished with the Italian birthday cake. It was very moist and flavorful without being too sweet. The price was a little high, but this is a celebrity chef with a restaurant on the vegas strip what would you expect. In the end we left satisfied and happier than when we went in."}
{"text":"Very good food!!! 

I had lasagna and my husband had the chicken parm and both were delicious!!!

We order also the octopus appetizer (don't really know the exact name) it was surprisingly yummi!!!! Like a soup but very tasty!!!! 



Huge portions so go very hungry!"}
{"text":"Decided to come to Buddy's on the spur of the moment because of the novelty of being on tv and didn't expect the food to be great but, man were we wrong! We weren't looking for anything too heavy because this was a late lunch and dinner was scheduled for 8pm. 
There wasn't a wait and we arrived during happy hour (4:30pm-6:30pm seven days a week). My wife had the Sangria and I had the Bloody Mary & Caesar. Tasty! 
We ordered the calamari, mac &a cheese carbonara, smashed meatball sliders, & sausage & peppers sliders. All of it was perfect. 
Service was attentive and prompt. Definitely on the list to come back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here the other day.
We weren't as thrilled as some of the other Yelpers, it may be because we didn't choose Italian items... But honestly, I didn't see it as an Italian restaurant when we walked in.
We were also in quite a hurry, so we were looking to be in-and-out people.

That being said, our waiters were terrific - polite and kept our sodas filled. My husband ordered the meatball sandwich, which he enjoyed. His one complaint was that the bread was toasted and made it very hard. I ordered the Chicken BLT, which also had avocado on it. It was quite yummy. It came with a tiny tiny Caesar Salad... So tiny, you can't help but wonder what the point is? 

All in all, tasty and a good experience!"}
{"text":"We got the ravioli with the white sauce and the chicken parmigiana. The food was fabulous and the staff were tremendous. We spent about the same or less than in our hometown. This place is very much worth the visit!"}
{"text":"No complaints about this place. Everything we had was quite good. We came here on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty empty. My husband had the Philly cheesesteak and i had the lasagna. The decor was very nice and the waitstaff was helpful. Nothing was overly amazing...simply good food in a very nice place. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Awesome place to sit down for food or apps with good wine! Our waitress was amazing and suggested fantastic food. Great relaxed atmosphere"}
{"text":"For a restaurant on the Vegas Strip, we were more than pleasantly surprised.  From soup to nuts Buddy V's delivered for a family vacation with four adults and three children. Everyone was happy with what they ordered which does not usually happen with such a large diverse crowd.  I was a bit disappointed in the pastry shop but the girls in our crew loved the chocolate covered strawberries! We would definitely re-visit when in Vegas again and recommend to friends and family. Service was good too.

Stand outs: 

Lasagne
Garlic Cheese Toast
Linguine with White Clams/Sauce"}
{"text":"Food and service were both top notch. We sat at the bar and ate because we were in a bit of a rush. I got the chicken penne alla vodka and it was delicious. The fresh bread they provide is awesome as well. Our bartender was extremely friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian Ristorante!! The food was delicious, the service was great & the portions were large. We were so happy we decided to give Buddy V's a try. We will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"We were given a table to for 3 outside of the restaurant and placed by the public restroom. There was a communication barrier with the pre-server which resulted in a $8.00 bottle of water. The entrees were not aesthetically pleasing to the eye and tasted bland. We ended up wasting 2 hours of our vacation on subpar food. The server was good, that is why I am giving it 2 stars."}
{"text":"This placed is SOOO GOOD!!! This was in our
top 3 favorite restaurants on our last Vegas trip. We went for lunch, the atmosphere was pretty casual,
for dinner you would need to be more dressed up. 

My husband got the meatball sandwich and said it was amazing! I got the Buddies Favorite Pizza, it was the perfect size for lunch.

Everything tasted so fresh! I wish I could eat at Buddy's again.... (well sooner than a year from now)"}
{"text":"I'm not a big Italian foodie but everything for dinner that I tasted was amazing. I ended up having the beef tenderloin and I ate every bite. 2 days later I'm still craving it. Wasn't too impressed with the desserts but did like the creme brûlée a lot."}
{"text":"Met a group of peeps for lunch.  Our first discussion at the table was where is the best place to park. Well, it wasn't the Venetian, where I was lucky enough to park and walk from. Grrrr!  After getting the waiter to confirm, use the Palazzo Valet, but it's still a little trek. 

The waiter was super friendly and nice, even when I returned my soda, because it had a funny smell. I promise it wasn't me...I made half the table confirm it smelled bad. 

I asked the waiter what was good and he said many things. I mentioned the chicken parm, because so many people on yelp ordered it, and he said that was a good option. So I went for it.  Buyers remorse!!  It was decent, don't get me wrong, but the guy across from me got a burger that looked amazing!!!  Who would have thunk it...a burger at an Italin joint?!  Next time!

The parm was ok, and most would probably love it, but I am super picky about my sauce, being raised in an Italian pasta sauce making family. It did have two big pieces of chicken, fried well, and not dry with ample cheese on top. I wouldn't throw it away, but it wasn't OMG, I am ordering this again.  I already know I will be ordering the burger next time. :P

I also wish I had room for the lobster tail dessert, but I just don't. :(

I would come back again, because I think this place could make me happy.  Just not a good start with the strange soda this time."}
{"text":"We were in town for work and didn't have much time for play. We picked this restaurant as our one night out, and it did not disappoint. The service was fast. We wouldn't get half way through drinks before it was filled back up with a smile. Would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I am still in love with Buddy V's. 
I have been to this restaurant several times, and EVERY single time the service is perfect, and the food is paramount. 
I always get the Caesar Salad, I just can't get enough of the polenta croutons. I tried the Steak Pizzaiolo, and IT WAS PHENOMENAL!! The steak was cooked perfectly, the sauce had a delicious Cacciatore flavor, and the cheesy polenta it came with was supreme. For dessert I tried the Butterscotch Creme Brûlée (it was the only one I hadn't tried yet) it's my new favorite dessert. 
When you come to Vegas and your craving Italian try Buddy V's, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here this past weekend in Vegas, we sat in the bar area. Good food, good service, cute restaurant and ambiance."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and with it being a newly opened I expected some issues. When we first arrived the waiter was not my favorite and was extremely rude, once he realized that we were there during restaurant week. But I spoke to the manager and she switched us to a new server. This guy made our night and I would go back just for him to serve us again. The chicken parm was the best I have ever had and lobster tail dessert was amazing. The only other issue was that we got a child's pizza for my son and it arrived after the rest of us were done with our meals. But the problem was fixed again by same manager and they took it off our bill."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. The service even better. The cost will put you in the poor house. Welcome to Vegas!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a really great experience here for lunch.  I wanted the Sunday Gravy, which was the special, but it turns out it is a dinner item.  The waitress insisted on going back and checking with the chef and he agreed to make it for me.  I'm glad he did, it was amazing.  We also had the cheese sticks for an appetizer.  They were delicious, though a bit unorthodox, it was more like a grilled cheese sandwich in tomato sauce.  Service was great and friendly.  The restaurant, for lunch, was relatively empty, but everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on a recent visit to Vegas and was not disappointed.  Their weekend brunches consist of a buffet option with plentiful options of the traditional Italian food options to normal breakfast options.  There is also a massive dessert table consisting of bread puddings to concoctions from Carlos bakery across the hall.  Our server was amazing and made sure our drinks were never more than half empty as we had all partaken in the all you can drink mimosa/sangria option.  He was even kind enough to get our last rounds in to go cups so we wouldn't have to wander the strip drinkless!"}
{"text":"Great appetizers the calamari was exceptional with a good lemon flavor.....chicken parm was on point"}
{"text":"If you want great Italian food with great service, come here! You don't have to get that fancy and the price is just right. The portion size of these dishes is remarkable. I ordered their Chicken Picatta and was blown away. I think I've probably had Chicken Picatta three times in my life. This was the best I've ever had. The lemon and garlic sauce was buttery, but not too thick and the pasta was cooked perfectly; as well as the chicken. I also enjoyed their bread that's cooked fresh. Everyone else was also very pleased with their meal. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Meatballs great flavor. Nice texture 
Ceasar salad v nice. Can taste the anchovy and served w fried polenta instead of croutons. 
Tomato soup, too salty but otherwise good. Very rich. 
Carbonera excellent and also rich. Nice contrast of texture with some crunch too.
Excellent service with effective waitress and water was always filled. 
Nutella dessert puts most molten lava desserts to shame. Must get it.
Too loud."}
{"text":"This place is great for happy hour! Affordable food and drink prices.  The macaroni had a crispy bread crumb topping that was not my preference, but the macaroni itself was good.  The fried calamari was a pretty decent size and also cooked well.  We also ordered the octopus appetizer off the regular menu.  It was tender, but sitting in a little bit of a bland sauce and the octopus was a bit burnt on the outsides which made it difficult to eat.  The fresh foccacia bread which they make is yummy.  Very reasonable prices for what you get. Service wasn't the quickest, but they were also pretty busy.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Decent place, loved the Alfredo Pasta. Not sure why I assumed this was Patio Dining. Staff is nice and responsive. They even adjusted my billing so that it can be billed to the room at The Palazzo which can earn my points towards my status. We really wanted to like the Tiramisu but it can be better.

Fine option if you are looking to spend a lazy day not doing much."}
{"text":"Holy cow, this was the best experience yet! We always go to Buddy V's for lunch when in Vegas. Delicious food, great ambiance and made to order. 

Joy was our server and she's quite an amazing bartender too! Joy's upbeat and positive energy rubbed off as soon as we were seated. She was very attentive, and had excellent customer service skills. She recommended we try her espresso martini to compliment our dessert plate. WOW. BEST MARTINI I've ever had!!! Ask for Joy!

Jose was also kind and attentive. He took photos of us and made sure we were comfortable. 

We gave Joy high accolades to one of the managers (Sean?), sadly he didn't seem interested in hearing our feedback and left the table right away. His attitude was less than impressive. 

Thank you Joy and Jose! Thank you to the chefs and kitchen staff for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to Buddy's and we got in for a late brunch.
You know it's Vegas when you sleep after breakfast and wake up for brunch.

The restaurant wasn't very crowded.
we were seated right away and i parked myself in a comfy booth.
we got 
~ grilled garlic bread (melted mozzarella and fontina cheese)
~ eggplant parm (crispy and crunchy eggplant tomato,mozzarella, parmesan)
~ cannoli (sweet cinnamon pastry with sweet ricotta)

The garlic bread and eggplant parm were good but the star was their famous cannoli which is loaded with sweet ricotta cream, pistachios and cocoa drops served with chocolate sauce.

What i didn't expect was the sloppy service, our server seemed to be having a bad day and it just felt like he wanted us to leave.
I wasn't offered bread and he was ready to bring the check when i had to interrupt him and ask if he would be so kind as to bring us a Dessert Menu.

In the end we let it slide because we were in a good mood and wanted to enjoy ourselves.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Today my friend and I were craving Italian food, and im glad that we chose this place. It definitely hit the spot! 

The restaurant was super clean, and not overly crowded. We were seated immediately. This was refreshing since Vegas tends to be crowded everywhere. We had a nice view of the strip and some of the surrounding hotels. 

I ordered the chicken parmesan, it was very good. The chicken had good flavor, and I substituted the marinara sauce for a cream sauce with penne pasta. 

The whole staff seemed to stop to offer us refills on drinks and bread. Everyone was working together to make sure we had everything we needed. 

No complaints, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food, large portions and Stewart is a great manager. Talked with us for some time. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying,  I'm a native and I avoid the strip like the plague.  However,  my mom had been here before and wanted to come back for her birthday.  So my sister and I decided to take her and her best friend here to celebrate her 65th.  I'm always down for trying new places and venturing out.  Let me just say this place did NOT disappoint!! 

Oh my goodness!!!   We sat in the bar area so we had a view.  Our bartender/server was Danny and he was amazing!!!  He made us a pitcher of sangria and it was ridiculously good.  We ordered lots of small plates/ appetizers so we could try different things.  The calamari was the best I've ever had outside of Maui.  My moms friend doesn't even like calamari and she loved it.  The caprese salad was hands down the best EVER!!!  The eggplant was incredible.....   I could go on and on but I honestly cannot say one  bad thing about this place.  

The service,  the food,  the ambiance....  it exceeded every single expectation!!!  I cannot wait to go back!!!  Absolutely incredible!!!  

It was awesome to celebrate my moms birthday with the most amazing meal possible!  Thanks Danny,  you rocked!"}
{"text":"Poor service, over-priced and mediocre food at best. They were not accommodating to special requests such as a different pasta sauce or adding cracked red pepper to a dish. People come here for the name but leave thinking Buddy V should stick to cake instead of restaurants."}
{"text":"I had got the chicken rigatoni alla vodka and a kale salad. Of course it was a meal that is a little pricey because it is at a hotel/casino. Its hard to share these dishes because they are more individual portions. The kale sald was very flavorful and good. I enjoyed the texture of the kale and it was way to eat. I didnt really like the rigatoni. I think it was undercooked because the rigatoni was hard and very difficult to chew. The sauce was good though. Our waiter was cool to talk to and welcoming. Nice to try because i do like buddy from cake boss, but I'm not planning to come back."}
{"text":"It was good. I saw this place on the hotel eats channel and ever since then, I've wanted to go.

The decor was cool. They're trying to make you feel like you're in your Italian grandma's house on a day where the kitchen is pumping out homemade lasagna. They definitely succeeded in this respect.

I only gave it four stars because the food is just good, not great. Very good ambience and service, but very average Italian food."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I had the chicken parm.  The chicken was good but the spaghetti side that came with it was fantastic!  The pasta was perfect and the sauce was the perfect amount and a great taste.  I look forward to returning.  Great environment too.  Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Well we didn't get to actually eat here because the hostess wouldn't seat us. I had promised my kids a treat from Carlos' Bakery but the line was huge, so we decided to get a table here instead & have dessert & drinks. It was around 3:30 & as it was between lunch & dinner the restaurant was mostly empty. The hostess informed us that since we weren't actually eating a meal she couldn't seat us at a table reserved for people who were eating a meal.  Hmmm, in a mostly empty restaurant. We would have had a few cocktails each as well as desserts, & we always tip well because regardless of how much or little we eat, the staff still has to do their job. So I guess my one star rating is for the hostess. Maybe we'll be back some day..."}
{"text":"came here on a recommendation from a friend. the restaurant is sort of hidden and yet a secret spot to go to when you're around the area. 
my girlfriend and i loved the atmosphere and the attentiveness of the server and staff with refilling our water and checking up on us! i'm in the service industry myself and i'm blown away by now we'll this team took care of us. 
i would recommend this place and the Chicken BLT to anyone!! it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The calamari fritti was a great opener for the family; daughter had the Margherita and polished it off too; father in law had the lasagne, he barely had 1/3 of it, it was huge, but he enjoyed it; hubby had a the steak pizzaiolo and he enjoyed it; had the linguine and clams and it was good, not great, too creamy for my taste but we had a great time, great view of the strip too."}
{"text":"We've always loved watching Buddy V on TLC's Cake Boss.  While standing in line for Carlo's Bake Shop, we noticed that Buddy V's Ristorante looked like it had a great environment so we made reservations for dinner.  We couldn't have been happier.  The food had a true Italian flare to it.  I had the Chicken Parmesean & my wife had the Shrimp Scampi w/ Angel Hair pasta.  We'll definitely being paying Buddy V's a visit the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Well, we've been here the last three times we visited Vegas!  This place definitely hits the spot if you're looking for an Italian fix.  It's traditional Italian food.  I love the lasagna!  The cheesy garlic bread is delicious too :)"}
{"text":"5 stars for the delicious food and the fantastic service I got!!! Its always nice to walk around the Venetian, but the location of this restaurant is quite strange to me, I thought it would be at the heart of Venetian.                                         But anyway I've heard of this place through a client of mine who went to the grand opening, I watch cake boss on tv all the time and I've been curious about this place so I had to check it out for myself.So the wait time for our table on a Saturday night was only 15 minutes, our waiter was great and the amazing client service we got was from our busboy Jamal. He was very attentive,efficient, and he just paid attention to everything. He should definitely get a promotion and a raise! Ok so now the review of the food. We started with a charred octopus (recommended by our waiter)as appetizer and it was seriously delicious, I love squid so this was perfect. For our drinks we got the brooklyn ipa and prosecco which went perfect with everything we ordered.For entreè we ordered Eggplant Parmesan with marinara pasta, Meatball Spaghetti and Garlic Bread on the side. Everything was so delicious. The garlic bread was a meal by itself. The portions here are huge, so you better go here with a huge appetite.And lastly we got the lobster tail and this was the cherry on top it was light,airy, and yummy! I'm very excited that the cake boss opened a restaurant in sin city! Now I don't have to drool all the time while watching him make amazing pastries on tv, I can just stop by Buddy V's ristorante instead! I will definitely go back because the experience and service I got was excellent."}
{"text":"Only thing better than the food was the service. A taste of Italy in Nevada! Made a reservation for a Friday night and got right in with no wait. Hostess staff was warm and welcoming. Started off with a nice Brunello and Caprese with burrata cheese and organic heirloom tomatoes,  accompanied with grilled Italian bread. The manager Kristina was very attentive and brought us their nicest red wine glasses for our Brunello, which we really appreciated. The Caprese was one of the best my husband and I have ever tasted. We have been blessed to spend lots of time in Italy and have had some spectacular Italian meals. Buddy V's was right up there with the best we've had in Florence, Rome and Tuscany. The pasta was perfectly al dente, prepared by Executive Chef Bryan, who we had the pleasure of meeting. We finished our meal with their spectacular cannoli's that were clearly made fresh to order based on their crunchy shell. We can't say enough about our experience at Buddy V's.....from the hostess, busboys, server, managers. This group definitely worked well together just like a big Italian family."}
{"text":"We had Sunday Brunch here and it was a wonderful experience.  The food was all excellent and our waiter was fantastic.

The Sunday Eggs were our favorite, and my wife isn't much of a fan of scrambled eggs.  The frittata had a lot of huge chunks of vegetables, especially asparagus.  The meatballs, chicken apple sausage, freshly smoked bacon, chicken parmesan, and mac-n-cheese were all excellent.  Of course, there were croissants, fresh breads, pastries, cannolis, tiramisu, zonuts, and other desserts.  The food was all delicious and far exceeded our expectations.

We also had all you can drink alcohol.  My wife had bellinis, sangrias, and mimosas.  I had a few beers which, unfortunately, was cheap domestics, but whatever.

I definitely recommend Buddy V's, which is right across the hall from Carlo's Bakery, and the next time we're in Vegas, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"In Vegas last week for a convention made reservations when we arrived we still had to wait around 10 minutes. Once we were seated took forever for our waitress to get to our table so the Manger took our drink order. And then again for another 10 minutes we waited to place our order. She finally takes our order. The food was good not great. Wanted to place a desert order but when no one comes back to take your order how can you.!!Finally waved down the Manger to pay out. Pricey place for such Terrible Service.!"}
{"text":"I have visited Vegas twice this month on business and had to eat at Buddy V's both times. I love the classic Jersey Italian dishes. I had the Chicken Piccata the first time. Skipped Appetizer and Salad since we didnt want to risk getting too full for dessert. Chicken was the perfect amount of Piccata. Dessert was the star of the night with the \"Italian Birthday Cake\". I consider this the perfect dessert. Beautifully presented on a signature chocolate signed plate and pedestal. The perfect balance of not too sweet and not too rich layers of rum soaked sponge cake and cream filling. Coffee was good too. 

Skip Maggianos Little Italy across the street and go to Buddy V's Instead. Far better quality and flavor."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch last week and I would go again if I was in the mood for a treat.  Very friendly waitstaff and managers.  Pretty much a nonstop flow of people refilling our drinks, taking our plates, checking in on us and making conversation.  There was kind of a weird moment at first when our group first came in and went up to the hostess podium and two young guys up at the front literally just turned and walked off without saying anything, but later on made up for it.  

Most of the food was delicious (a few hot items were cold already due to there being too much AC in here, as other reviewers have mentioned, but it's not under their control).  They have mini cronuts!  And really excellent french toast.  Our whole group was very satisfied - there was something for everyone - seafood, veggie items, fancy meats, lots of sweet stuff."}
{"text":"We ate at Buddy v twice during our most recent stay in Vegas. Our first meal was so good (and so reasonably priced) that we went back a second time. For this visit, Kristina, the restaurant manager, could not have been any nicer. She accommodated us with a great table where our stroller could fit (we were traveling with a 3 year old and 2 month old) and checked in with us multiple times throughout the meal, including engaging in playful banter with our son. At the end of the meal, she gave him a light up cup that made his night. In a tourist-laden city where the service often slacks, Kristina did an exceptional job. I couldn't recommend buddy v any more if you are looking for a reasonably priced and family friendly Italian restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"Everything here was amazing including the service, cocktails, and entrees! Surf and turf was perfect. Big thanks to Mourad for the great service and for recommending we add scallops to our plates. Everything was simply amazing."}
{"text":"Best dining experience you can get in Vegas for great taste, generous portion, and chic ambience. Outstanding service"}
{"text":"This the second time we eat here with the wife when in Vegas. Glad we came. The wife and I enjoyed the food. We tried the calamari and lasagna. We were pleasantly surprised with the calamari. I hate when the calamari comes out chewy. Luckily this was not the case. The lasagna was also good and recommended. 

The portions of big so I recommend sharing and entree. My wife and I did and we still didn't finish the food. 

Overall I would it give it a 4.25"}
{"text":"First time here at the Cake Boss' restaurant. Quiet Monday so the place was not crowded. We were seated tight away in a nice circular booth with a great view of the Wynn.

Our waitress was very helpful and went over the menu with us and brought us some hot bread while we made up our minds on what to order.

We ordered the Shrimp Scampi and the V. Family Sunday Gravy. Delicious! The best Italian food and good value for the money.

In addition to the restaurant, there is a bar and a bakery for take out desserts.

Overall a five star experience..."}
{"text":"The BEST linguine and clam I have ever had!!!!
I could tell the clams were extremely fresh. Plus, it had a generous amount of clams and chopped clams in the dish. Heaven in my mouth!!!
It was too good to the point where the margherita pizza seemed so bland. I had to take the pizza home but it was perfect for the late midnight snack. The tomato basil soup was a little bit on the salty side but wasn't terrible. The mac n cheese was also very delicious! The bread crumbs made a great combination with the mac n cheese.
Overall, the service and food was amazing. I would definitely come back more often."}
{"text":"Loved the food at Buddy V's. Great Gluten free options as well!  Very accommodating of our larger group."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going here but we were very disappointed in Buddy's restaurant.  The service was lousy.  The food came room temperature and was sub par.  The veal my husband ordered was overcooked and tough so he didn't eat it. The server hardly came by to check on us and when she asked how our dinner was, my hubby said \"it's ok.\" She left without really listening or noticing that he had barely touched his food. She never attempted to correct the situation or ask if he would like something else.  This place is overpriced and over-rated."}
{"text":"If you want touristy low grade Italian food this is the place. Very low quality food and way overpriced. Buddy isnt going to make it in vegas just on his good name. Meat balls were good, chicken parm tasteless , cheap low grade spaghetti side thrown next to it. At the price point should have used linguini with a higher grade sauce."}
{"text":"Servers are pretty hot and intelligent. Pizza was a little bit too salty. Everything else especially the antipasti tastes great. The main dish medium well steak was somehow pricy. I didn't see one single cow on the way from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. This may explain the tag haha."}
{"text":"By far the best spaghetti I've ever had.  I'm from a place where we don't have many options regarding Italian food SO I have not gotten away from large franchise Italian restaurants much, but this is the best."}
{"text":"Ordered grilled octopus(spicy), chicken parm, food is really salty, just ok level. However, the tiramisu and Italian birthday cake are awesome. I think the ads guy was in Cake Boss show? Desert is worth the visit. Should have made reservation otherwise line is long."}
{"text":"Disappointed!! I ordered my food with high expectations, because well it's a famous restaurant. I ordered the chicken marsala. The chicken marsala at Olive Garden is better than this one. Definitely not worth it for 28 dollars."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. The food was good, but the service was a bit odd. Maybe it was because we were seated in the bar area and it was just a server \"free for all\" but we had probably three or four different people helping us. You would think \"hey, awesome! You must have been really taken care of!\" But no, we found ourselves repeating orders or answering the same question to several different people which became annoying. Prices were Vegas high, which is no surprise. So yeah, just a \"meh\" experience!"}
{"text":"It was good, but $24 for spaghetti and meat balls should have been closer to $17/18. The Caprese salad was also pretty unique and comes with a large tomato you slice yourself as well as cherry tomatoes."}
{"text":"This review is for Buddy V's brunch. It's $34.95 with soda, ice tea, or coffee from 10:30am to 2:30pm (I think) on Saturday and Sunday. In short, it's awesome. It's probably our favorite brunch on The Strip due to the selection, quality, value, and service. 

The selection is huge and there's a menu online but for a brief recap there's a carving station (ham, bacon, 2 kinds of sausages), shrimp cocktail, eggs/frittata, charcuterie station, a couple kinds of pasta, meatballs, chicken parmesan, salad, french toast, crespelle, pastries, like 5 kinds of cookies, like 4 kinds of cakes, cannolis, and fruit. A nice touch is that there's two sets of meatballs/chicken parmesan so if one is empty you can get some from the other station. They were great about refilling the dishes and every trip I went up, everything was available.

It's a buffet so don't expect things to be the same as ordering from Buddy V's off the menu. That being said, it was all still very good. Even the fruit was good (because it was sweet), and they had more exotic options like dragon fruit and rambutan as well. 

Service was friendly and they were very good about refilling drinks and clearing plates. All that said, I think what you get is very good for the price."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at this restaurant , I looked it up here on yelp and thought It  would be kid friendly . Well I Was súper wrong, my 18 month old started to cry maybe 5 min and I Was asked by the manager to take him outside if I could not control him kinda like a dog. I could not believe it !  OMG  of course I wanted to control him! It was 4:30 Pm on a Saturday, instead of making a scene I walked out of the restaurant with my baby and did not come back in. My husband paid our bill, for the meal that we weren't even able to eat because of this horrid situation.  I still can't believe it ! I felt so angry.  I don't recommend it to anyone and I  recommend that anyone with a child  Boycott it !!!!!!"}
{"text":"O M G. If you are looking for homemade, delicious, traditional, NY Italian food- this is where you need to be. The food in this place tasted like home in Brooklyn in my mother in laws kitchen. The restaurant is in a wing of the Venetian and across the way from it, is Carlo's Bakery. (You can easily access the restaurant from outside the Venetain. Its above the Walgreens close to the Deuce stop. Almost like you are leaving the Ventian and walking towards Palazzo). The restaurant was very pretty with gorgeous views. The vibe is very causual, laid back, like you stopped by a friends house. Any clothing goes. No dress code. Not at all stuffy and pretentious like Giadas. (see review). We had a friend with us from Texas who had never had NY Italian food, so we had to take her there and see if it was authentic. Authentic it was. We started out with the mozzerella and Carozz that was amazing. I got the \"Sunday Gravy\"- which is exactly how we make it here. You get a bowl of pasta, with a seperate skillet of red meat sauce with meatballs (OMG delish), pork shoulder, lamb. My husband had pasta bolongese. Insanely good. My Texas friend had the lasagne. It was huge and she ate it for 3 days. All portions were big. The food was not pricey. The dessert menu comes in what looks like an old photo album, and it contains pics of a young Buddy and family with his dad, and then pics of him with his own kids. The whole place is decorated in family pictiures in frames on the walls. For dessert, we had the Nutella (yes Nutella) Lava cake!! OMG. Melted Nutella runs out of the center of this lava cake served with Salted Caramel ice cream. There are no words. Get yourself there  ASAP. You will not be sorry. It was so good, we went twice during out 10 day stay. Had to go back for lunch and got more meatballs, eggplant parm and 2 amazing salads. My new fav place in Vegas. Buddy needs to franchise these places out across the country. I hear Buddy is there monthly. Sadly he was there as soon as we got home to Nyc. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am so glad we stopped by here... we were famished for lunch.

Best chicken Parmesan I've ever had.. Seriously.  The spaghetti served with it was al dente unlike so many places in the USA.  We split it and it was good size for my bf and I.  Wait staff was wonderful to do it without us even asking.

We also had the cheese plate with sliced meat which was really good.. A lot in quantity.  My fav was the salami and blue cheese.  Pickles weren't bad either.

Shared the meatballs as well which were good.  Not the best ever.. Six small meatballs come in the order with marinara."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, amazing atmosphere! This one was really Italian for a very good price! The only cherry  missing on the cake, was having a sgroppino afterwards.."}
{"text":"It was mine and my husbands 14 year anniversary and I was looking for a fantastic restaurant for us to go out to for a romantic evening! I was recommended by a friend to try Buddy Vs because she works as a concierge on the strip and said it has been a pretty popular choice among tourists.... Let me start by saying people must like this place bc of the fact that it's owner has a tv show because I was very unimpressed! 
Ok, let me say that it is a beautiful restaurant but not much for a romantic evening... My husband and I were sat at a table barely large enough to hold out plates on, and we were in between 2 other larger parties! We felt completely cramped and not the least bit romantic! However we decided to try to make the best of our night and ordered some of our favorite Italian dishes! When our food arrived I wouldn't put it too far past a fast food Italian taste! There was nothing great about our food and most definitely not worth the price! We are locals who love good Italian food and there are many, and I do mean many, that we have tried off the strip who far exceed Buddy Vs! We will leave this restaurant for the tourists!"}
{"text":"I love a home style Italian meal. The food at buddy v's is simply perfection in this catagory. We had a special birthday lunch here. What can I say, service was oecable. Our waiter t.j. Was highly versed on the options we had a couple if starters the fried mozzarella left us speachlesd, and the calimari was a great compliment. The best part was their adaption if chop salad for a lunch salad it was huge! Save room for dessert, we had the famous lobster roll and the most Devine Italian rum cake served in a miniature cake stand complete with candles for the birthday girl! We can hardly wait for the bakery to open trust we will be the first in line! Yes this will be someplace to come again and again - oh I almost forgot auto pilot parking if you love valet pull in hop out and a quick elevator ride and you are there! This is a winner! Hands down."}
{"text":"Just returned from Vegas. Had reservations for 5pm before seeing Rock Of Ages Show.  Went personally at noon to confirm reservations, as the two ladies in our party of four were celebrating birthdays, and wanted to make sure we would get window seats.  The original reservations were made at the same time room reservations were made by the pallazo hotel.  We were told we would be given window seats. Well the hostess said she could not guarantee, but made a note of the request as well as the birthday celebration.
We arrived at 4:45pm fifteen minutes early, and found an almost empty restaurant.  As luck would have it, the original hostess was there.  She said she would be able to seat us \"near\" a window table.  I laughed and said, well it looks as though you have lots of tables.....her comment was to go sit in the lounge \"bar\" area until our reservation time.  Trying to sell drinks I suppose.  We sat there , not ordering drinks, and she started to seat us away from the window....again I reminded her, and miraculously she found a table.. It dawned on me later (after my wife explained) she was fishing for a tip to \"find a table\"
Anyway, we ordered.   The Lasagna came, large portion, lots of cheese and meat, little skimpy on the sauce.  Wife had Chicken Parmesan which was overcooked and little sauce.  The other couples order consisted of a new York steak which she raved about, but her husband had steak and lobster, and said the steak he had was tough, but the lobster was good.  
Table service was good, lots of flat bread, water refills.
Oh....if you happen to like a nice fruity White Zinfandel (the fastest growing wine category in the US) you will not get it there.. They don't carry one,  I know some restaurants are a bit snobbish because its a \"blend\"  

So regarding the birthdays?  Well most restaurants will make an effort to do something to acknowledge a celebration.... Desert came and went, nothing...

Anyway, I know they have not been open for very long.  Our waiter was good, food runners ok...The Floor manager spent his time looking from a distance, but made no contact with the customers.  

Place looks nice, food ok, price ok....but Buddy......you need to instill a little passion in your place...Your gonna have to step it up to compete with the upscale establisments located in the same building."}
{"text":"Let me start off by stating the positive, the service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive, efficient and friendly. The food was  average, a bit overpriced. I probably won't go back but had to try it."}
{"text":"This might not only be my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas but just my favorite restaurant period. I have been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. We first came for dinner with a couple friends. We loved it so much we returned the next day for their Sunday brunch. It been a Vegas go to ever since. They also have a great happy hour! I suggest the lasagna or the mac n cheese carbonara. The Sunday brunch is a great spread and different from other brunches. Of coarse Carlos Bake Shop is just across the hall so definite plus for after meal sweets."}
{"text":"a tad hard to find if you're walking over from the palazzo - it's easiest if you exit through the palazzo entrance and then swing a left and walk down the sidewalk. there's a side entrance that brings you right to the front door of buddy v's.

it's a cute italian restaurant and seems very family friendly. portions are huge and easy to share. i had chicken piccata, which is one of my favorite italian dishes of all time. they do an excellent rendition with linguine!"}
{"text":"Customer service is top notch here. Food options not so much to choose from but everything we ordered seemed good. Great portion size and food came out quick. Would eat here but only for lunch."}
{"text":"After spending most of the day in the sportsbook, I was ready to chow down and my belly was craving some Italian food. Upon check in at the Palazzo, my wife and I were handed a coupon book to select restaurants, bars, etc. inside of the Venetian and Palazzo. This included a coupon for Buddy V.'s. So we decided give this place a shot when we saw that this place had opened recently and had received four stars on Yelp. 

We started off on the light side of things with a Caesar salad. There was nothing particularly great about this salad except for the croutons. I'm not really a crouton fan because they tend to be too bland, salty and/or crunchy.  Normally I would pass over them completely. After my wife urged me multiple times and after I had refused multiple times, I saw my wife's fork with a crouton on the end of it right smack in front of my mouth. I succumbed to peer pressure and tasted what was probably one of the best croutons ever. The crouton had a crunchy exterior and then evolved to a smooth and creamy interior with a terrific garlic flavor inside. It was so delicious that I had to fight my wife for the rest.  Looking back, she probably regrets shoving that crouton in my mouth. 

I ordered the Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno which was served in an incredibly hot iron skillet. I think the cheese was still bubbling a little bit when they brought it out to our table. This was probably one of the thickest lasagnas I have eaten in a long time. This lasagna came with generous portions of fresh Italian sausage and ground beef and layered with ricotta, mozzarella and provolone cheeses. The marinara sauce was a perfect blend of sweetness and spiciness and had settled to mostly the sides of the lasagna. The top was sprinkled with a tiny amount of Italian parsley. This was one of the best lasagnas I have had in a long time. Each bite melted in my mouth. There was no doubt I was going to finish dish.

Because of the reviews, tips, and photos of meatballs on Yelp, my wife had to go with the meatball spaghetti. Needless to say, she polished off the dish easily and said it was one of the best meatball spaghettis she had tasted. The meatballs at Buddy V.'s inspired her to go home and cook some meatballs herself. I think that in itself should speak volumes about their meatballs.

We had just enough room at the end to split their Tiramisu which was equally as delicious as our entrees. It was a nice touch to include a side of lady fingers in order to swipe any remaining coffee flavored cream at the end with them.

The service here was top notch. Our waitress was fully knowledgeable about the menu and was ready to offer suggestions. She was great from start to finish! 

Even with the coupon, I agree with the other reviewers that say this restaurant is on the pricey side."}
{"text":"This place has quality Italian cuisine. The salumi and cheese board are high quality ingredients and a must have! This appetizer would feed up to 4 people. The chicken with vodka sauce was delicious. The sauce was perfectly seasoned and the chicken was tender. I did get the famous dessert \"Buddy V Lobster Tail\". It was a croissant style pastry shaped like a lobster tail filled with cream. It looked really fun, but the pastry was so hard I couldn't cut it with a fork. Other than the dessert everything else was great!"}
{"text":"The service was very good. We had a reservation and showed up 10 min early and people were overstaying their time at their tables but the staff made it a priority to get us seated. 

We ordered the garlic parmesan cheese bread and calamari for the appetizer. The bread had very little taste of garlic and was mostly just a cheese bread. The calamari was delicious and was nice and crispy, and I always go for the deep fried jalapeño pieces. For my main dish I ordered the salmon which was cooked perfectly and was light enough for me to leave room for the Italian birthday cake for dessert. The cake was nice and moist but it was very hard to eat for how it was served."}
{"text":"Always the best experience when we go there. Great food, Great Service, Fabulous company."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice so far this year and can't wait to come back in August. The veal parmesan is the best I have ever had. Appetizers and salad also great. I am always with a group and everyone always raves about the food. Good job guys."}
{"text":"Came here for late drinks with a huge party so this is really about the bar service and menu.

They didn't have a huge cocktail menu but whatever they served was pretty darn good.  It's good to see that even the Cake Boss knows you gotta spice up your drinks to make people get sloshed (like we did for a big reunion party).  I had a berry mohjito that was absolutely kick ass.  The bartender was also very friendly and did a good job of making sure the drinks kept flowing.

The ambiance of this place is really nice and there's a good amount of space that can accommodate a large number of guests, making it a great meeting spot if you're part of a big party or celebration."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch. Absolutely love this place. Got a window seat, had a life band, service was excellent, food was delicious. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Einfach nur lecker von A-Z!!!
Dazu noch eine tolle Atmosphäre und sehr freundliches Personal, wir kommen wieder!!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Fast and very friendly service. Food was delicious. Good variety of options on the menu, and our server Crystal really knew how to get everything right even though we had a complicated order. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"So you are on the strip and don't know what to eat? Come here. This place has nice views of the strip and the restaurant is very well designed. 
I ordered the cheese stake and it was amazing, the most addicting part of the fries. The menu offer variety of foods with a mix of Italian and American. You can't go wrong, oh and they specialize in desserts! I loved the tiramisu, must get with coffee. This is my second time here and I'm a local. Oh, and free parking at the palazo/Venetian!"}
{"text":"The wait staff service was great. Hostesses were unfriendly. Food was very bland. The caesar salad was good, but the croutons were terribly weird sponges. Between my husband and I, we had a Caesar salad, a meatball sandwich, and pasta bolognese...the meat sauce was bland, making both the pasta and the sandwich a bore. Another downfall, no fresh bread was served, but instead there were packaged crunchy \"bread\" sticks sitting on the table. Although the location is conveniently located in the middle of everything and the decor cute, the actual food was a disappointment and the cost even more so (+$50 for our 3 item meal!) We will not return."}
{"text":"It was good but not blow-your-mind good. We had the calamari appetizer (great), caesar salad (ok, thought the croutons were weird), chicken parmesan (good, didn't care for the spaghetti that came with it, big portion), and shrimp scampi (wasn't a creamy type scampi, I liked the noodles but thought the shrimp were really salty), and the cannoli (good). Overall pretty tasty but not amaaaaazing."}
{"text":"We were just there last night, and we found it to be great.  Our server was Caleb and he was wonderful, he helped explain everything about our dishes so we could make the best choices for us.  Food was great, service was great, I would go back in a heart beat.  The manager that night was Adam and he was very attentive and funny from the time we walked in to the time we left.  The two of them really made our visit go over the top.Food AAa  Service AAA"}
{"text":"The party I was with of 7 dined here on Labor Day weekend on Friday evening.  Some in the party were in no shape to dine, while I was ready to feast.  As usual, another benefit of Yelp is doing a quick search and relying upon fellow Yelper's to point me in the right direction!

I had one of the best plates of lasagna in recent memory and the photo I took and am attaching with this review attest.   Perfect sauce, heat and layers of fresh and flavorful awesomeness.   So good that those who follow Anthony Bourdain and those who are with Guy Fieri would appreciate it.

The bread to start was perfect warm crunchiness and the cheese plate was incredible-really tasty pecorino and a solid gorgonzola.  My wife's rigatoni with vodka sauce was tasty.  Attentive service in a relaxed atmosphere with a great view facing the strip at night."}
{"text":"Buddy has done it again! Not only is his bakery next door amazing, but his restaurant is great too. I've been here both during lunch and dinner, but at night it has a more dark tone with warm lights, great for a romantic night but good too for families. No matter what table you are seated in, you will have a view of the kitchen and the chefs. 

Our server Brittany was really nice and bubbly. I was having trouble deciding between the scallops and the chicken parm, she recommended the chicken parm and assured me that in case I didn't like it that I could order something else. 

But she was right! The chicken parm was delicious! I personally don't like chicken, but this was juicy and crunchy, covered with hot marinara sauce and cheese covering it all.  It also came with spaghetti marinara on the side. 

My friend was jealous and wish she had gotten mine. She ordered the seabass, which was flaky and good  too, but I still liked mine better."}
{"text":"This is such a great restaurant and I highly recommend this restaurant. I had a lot of food and the stomach pain from so much food was totally worth it. This restaurant has great service and the breadsticks were the bomb. Furthermore, the meatballs were fat juicy spheres of goodness. . Also their cannolis give me life. I hope you enjoyed this review as much as you will enjoy this restaurant assuming you really liked this review.

{"text":"Did not know much about Buddy V background and his rep on desserts. We went in a couple years ago as guests at Palazzo. Now it's a staple on our liSt based on the food. It's not a huge menu but what they got is goooddd. I always go for the chicken parm. Two big breasts and a side of pasta. It's plenty for two. Other folks in our party had bucatini and it was rich with great fresh pasta. Was not over sauced to allow all flavors. We did the Price Fix menu which for $40 bucks gets you an app, entree and choice of dessert (cannoli or tiramisu). Meatball appetizer was really good though they are a little on the small size compared to Carmine's, Lavo or Matrianos. Chicken parm is a little thicker than other places but keeps the chicken juicy without too much breading. The red sauce on the parm and pasta side is super fresh tomato taste. We had one each of the cannoli and Tiramisu. Cannoli was crunchy with cream and chocolate chunks with a side of chocolate syrup. Wow was it good. Tiramisu was also very good and I liked because not to bitter with coffee taste. It comes in a little jar with a couple of side cookies. Both great for sharing at the table. Atmosphere is really good with view looking over the strip. Nice bar/lounge area with live music some nights. Service was really good and efficient."}
{"text":"Delicious! To start, the garlic bread and fried mozzarella really set you up for a great meal. Then for the main course, we had the lasagna (not pictured) and the eggplant Parmesan with a side of spaghetti. Amazing!! And what's a trip to Buddy's without the famous lobster tail?? This has got to be one of my favorite Italian restaurants I've been to. Thanks buddy!"}
{"text":"This my first time here and this is absolutely amazing. The meal the service everything was absolutely amazing. I will definitely be back... this food made me feel like I am home. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE...I went there yesterday to celebrate my birthday.  I'm a Cake Boss fan.  I'm 100% Sicilian and thought it would be fun to try.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.. OK tell me what Italian Restaurant doesn't serve bread... you have to order garlic bread full of grease flavor garlic not even real butter flavor and smothered in melting cheese... how about some nice Italian bread you can dip in olive oil ...the Caesar salad didn't have any anchovies on it,,,, HELLO Italian eat anchovies,,, the portions were very small and just NOT GOOD.... the Lobster Claw said it was filled with Canoli filling and cream... sorry it was just straight whipped cream with baileys in it.... very disappointing.  I'm a NYer and I know what a real lobster claw is supposed to be..., I will never go there again and OMG the prices were very expensive.... 2 for lunch came to $100.00 and it wasn't good at all... Sorry Buddy... you need to get those people trained right... and get some good bread in there..."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Waiter was outstanding! Although a little pricey, its Vegas, you get what you pay for. The service was excellent and the food was very good. It was a little noisy, but all in all, I would visit again."}
{"text":"I would like to thank Buddy V and his staff for making my sons high school graduation dinner exceptional . The food was unbelievable and the staff outstanding,  this is the place to go if you want to have a memorable dinner with a wonderful group of people , they truly were the icing on the cake .."}
{"text":"Food and service here is great! Lunch prices are pretty decent and portions are more than enough for one person. Our server recommended some of their best dishes for our group and they were all delicious! The buddy pizza, lazagna, mozzarella appetizer, chicken BLT sandwich, YUM! :)"}
{"text":"Food was a 4 star but the service was a 3 at best. We used open table to book a reservation for 2 at 9pm about 30 min before we arrived on a Friday night but other people were walking in with no problems. Cheese Bread was good, lasagna was excellent, grilled chicken was good and Ceasar Salad was great. Other servers looked more engaged with their tables than out blonde waitress but maybe just luck of the draw. For $120 for 2 people before tip I'd rather go to Buchon."}
{"text":"Herb bread has a very strong flavor. Lots of herbs. Their cheeses on the adult Mac n cheese is out of this world. There is ham an peas in it. I am a vegetarian so I was surprised that there was ham bits in the Mac n cheese. Salad was very fresh and dressing definitely homemade. Spaghetti bolognes was a very generous portion and tastes of Italy! Excellent ambiance!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good Italian place.  Good atmosphere, reasonable prices for Vegas and super great waitstaff. I'm a pretty snotty Italian reviewer so for most people this may be a 4 star. It has a fairly mainstream flavor. Do try the garlic bread and buddy's Sunday gravy.  Both really good."}
{"text":"How about the best Eggplant parmesan ever. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside but not mushy! Just perfect! The marinara sauce was perfect too. Since it was an appetizer but a good sized portion, got a side order of pasta it. The garlic bread was also amazing! Great location inside the Venetian Hotel on the 2nd floor."}
{"text":"Delicious! Highly recommend the salmon and Cesar salad! The bread is so soft and warm, freshly made. Quality of food is great and portions are more than enough! Price is $$$$ of 5 plan to spend $100 per couple, but I definitely think it's an experience one must try if your in Vegas! 
Cons: No restrooms, restrooms are outside the restaurant not far but an inconvenience. Lasagna had a little too much Rosemary and same with the Cesar salad to many herbs. Other than that great serve and super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We were there for our anniversary. Best Italian food ever,fast service and very friendly waiters."}
{"text":"We didn't expect much from Buddy's. We figured, ah, another TV personality restaurant. Like, whatever. However, we stopped in for a late-night dinner after seeing the Beatles Cirque show at the Mirage, when not much else (even in Vegas) was open at 9:30pm on a Sunday. And Buddy's turned out to be the Boss. As in, very NJ Italian.

Caesar salad usually has hard-as-rock bread croutons. Not here. Buddy's croutons were amazing, soft, warm polenta/cheese cubes. Loved that! The Chicken Piccata was also very tasty, a generous portion with lots of capers and lemon. Very nice. Cute Italian breadsticks-in-wrappers on the table. Surprised and pleased with our meal. 

Finally, don't get the weirdly-frosted cupcakes at the Carlo's bakery across from Buddy's (the ones with gobs of over-colored icing on the top). Instead, DO get their authentic Italian/NJ \"lobster claw\" pastries filled with cream. You could die. They were that good."}
{"text":"I came here the other day for their Sunday buffet brunch special.

 My experience was very enjoyable, from the good food to the excellent service.

Since it was a buffet, I ended up trying a lot of the food they had to offer. Some of the food that stood out to being especially good was the Sunday eggs, the chicken parm, panetone French toast, the caesar salad, the chicken apple sausage, and meatballs. There was mac and cheese there as well. This was the first time I had mac and cheese at a buffet or all you can eat setting, and it tasted exceptional. The noodles weren't over cooked, and the cheese sauce was tasty and creamy, there was a bread crumb like topping on it that help bring it all together. There was even some partially peeled shrimp there. Unlike some places, it was properly cleaned and deveined, on top of it not being over cooked and mushy. I wish the cocktail sauce that accompanied it had some more flavor and horseradish in it. The, what I were to assume, mini cannoli were excellent, even though they were already filled, the shell was still crispy and crunchy while the filling wasn't overly sweet.

All of the food I tasted had flavor, and was appealing to the eye, which tends to be a lacking attribute for a lot of buffet places. While you saw the cooks actually make the food, it actually tasted and looked like it was made from scratch, not something that came from a bag, frozen, or reheated from the day before.

The service was top notch. My glass was never less that 1/3 empty, and the busser made sure I always had fresh forks and knives when I came back with more food. The waitress and busser were very attentive, always making sure I was comfortable, enjoying myself, and asking if there was anything they could do for me.

For the price, selection and quality of food, and service, I was very satisfied with my experience at Buddy V's Ristorante. Not only will I most definitely be coming back for the brunch special, I would recommend the place to other people that I know."}
{"text":"One of the best birthday dinners, ever. The server and busser were so attentive, they could not have been more wonderful. In addition, the food was incredible. Homemade ravioli, yum. Oh and obviously, you're not allowed to not have dessert there :) Thank you. Delizioso!"}
{"text":"2 stars based on decor alone. Everything else was really unsatisfactory.  We were seated at a dirty table with napkins, a receipt and straws on the sticky floor. The hostess grabbed a towel and wiped it off but not entirely.  Still sticky and gross. We ignored that but the wobbly table was obnoxious. The server came over and ignored the garbage at her feet so I pointed it out and asked for something to even out the table. The busser brought by our share plates and mine had a nice long hair attached to it under my napkin. We ordered the garlic bread and meatballs. The garlic bread wad just that. Simple, not exciting, garlic bread, and the meatballs were very dence. We are both Italians and they weren't the soft flavorful moist meatballs we were use to. Just dence and dry. The sauce wasn't memorable either. The wine was fine, but we were just kind of turned off by then. I asked for the bill and got the wrong one. All together I really don't think we'd be back."}
{"text":"The food is average, but the desserts...oh oh oh!!! Some of the best I've ever tasted! The Italian birthday cake and Lobster Tail are to die for. Skip Carlo's bakery and order the desserts at Buddy V's!!!!"}
{"text":"Best experience ever 
We went a group of four and ordered different food
For starters appetizers we got the calamari fritti and the Aunt Ninas mozzarella en carozza

The calamari fritti has been the best ever calamari I've ever taste very delicious the flavor is mouth watering so good 

Ninas mozzarella en carozza is also another must try very delicious 

I had the  Nona's lasagna al forno ,very very delicious very bite was amazing I've never had good authentic Italian lasagna it was with every bite so delicious 

My brother in law : ordered the  spaghetti central meatball ; let me tell you that I've tried different spaghetti and this place right here at Buddy V Ristorante has been the best spaghetti and meat balls I've ever tried in my life the best of the best 


My girlfriend ordered Buddy favorite (pizza) very delicious and flavorful



If your in Las Vegas and craving real authentic Italian food stop by at the Venetian 

Check out Buddy V Ristorante best of the best and a must ride the Gondola it's an Italian experience worth it"}
{"text":"Came here with a reservations and got seated right away. They weren't packed at all. Our servers and bussers were super nice and accommodating. I ordered the scallops which was 5 pieces with prosciutto. The scallops are too seasoned in the rosemary flavor, which threw me off. I'm not a fan of rosemary so it was too much for me. I had to swap dishes with my boyfriend. He had the sea bass which was not bad; crispy on skin and flavor was a bit salty but decent. We had cheesy bread to start off too and it was too filling to finish with our entrees. Our wine was good and the we had a side of broccoli that had a kick of spice to it. It was my birthday too, so they gave us a cannoli with happy birthday written in chocolate. It was complimentary which was nice. It wasn't that great for it to be $114 (without tips). Reminds me a lot of Bucca too except that it's not made for family style. I want to return to try their lobster tail dessert, since i heard good things."}
{"text":"All started out well. After our salads the kitchen then fell apart. We waited and waited and waited. All the other tables were served. Then we asked when we would get out dinner. Oops. Sorry. Few more minutes. About 10 min later we get the food. All ok not great. Cold pasta probably waited while chicken was cooked. By now all we want to do is leave. No offer to comp. No we're sorry we sucked how about a dessert. Nothing. Waiter hovered while we filled out a comment card. Manager disappeared. Found a hostess who was giving a free dessert to another table for their inconvenience. All in all. Don't go there not worth it. Price high. Value low. Food mediocre. Service terrible. Will not return and will tell all to avoid. For a much better meal go to Viva Las Arepas!"}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I had dinner here on a weeknight. The service was prompt and attentive...perhaps a bit awkwardly overly attentive, but no complaints here. The food was discouraging though - It was only so-so. Afterward we moved onto dessert and had the birthday cake and it was mind blowingly good. I have never had better. Although a fan of the show, I can now say I've experienced why Buddy is called the Cake Boss. The disappointment came at the check...we split all dished: an appetizer, main dish, and desert with ice cream and had no drinks....$76. I probably won't return to the restaurant, but I sure will hit the bakery when it opens up next door."}
{"text":"I have many food allergies and our waiter took great care in taking note of them. Then the manager came over and informed us that the chef would be making all of my food himself and fresh. They did an amazing job keeping me healthy and made me feel like a queen. They treated my 3 children like little kings and queens. Such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Bad experience.  They put a single diner in a corner table. No server ever showed up.  The place wasn't busy but they just kept walking past the table.  No one cared until I left. 
The bakery is busy but the restaurant needs some work."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service.
However, how do you run out of Pinot Grigio in an Italian restaurant at 6:30 pm on a Tuesday night? Secondly, after switching to a $16 per glass red wine, it was served in  a Libby 's style wine glass !  Time to upgrade the glassware Buddy!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was really great! I went with my family at 11:30 for brunch and was very satisfied with my experience. The restaurant is huge and the little details make it special. You can tell that it is inspired by Buddy's family which gives it a homey and comfortable feel. The coffee and food was fantastic as well as the service. We ordered the eggplant Parmesan, buddy's pizza, pasta carbonara, calamari, caprese, spaghetti and meatballs, and the tomato soup. Everything was so delicious and satisfying. The dessert menu was a nice touch as well because it is like a family photo album which I thought was a nice detail. Service was excellent and our wait staff was very attentive. We ordered in advance from Carlo's bakery and ate in in the restaurant along with our coffee. Overall this place was excellent and I will probably be back in the future."}
{"text":"This is a perfect low key Italian joint.  The best chicken parm I have had, which is saying something.  Also, the pasta was a perfect al dente.  

Kid friendly, reasonable prices(for Vegas, anyway), good portion sizes.

Casual, non-spectacle joint, which is needed once in a while when visiting this town."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here. The atmosphere is fabulous and the staff are simply brilliant. We had coffee and a cannoli (hope that is the correct spelling) one afternoon and then came back for dinner. We ate the best lasagne ever with a gorgeous ceaser salad. The view was lovely. I loved it and will go back next time I visit Vegas. 
Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced, but hey- it's Vegas. The food was definitely good- HUGE and too filling GOR us to get to try the desert, but it hit the spot."}
{"text":"The sea bass was very tasty. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was that all I had on the plate was the bass and an itty bitty salad....more of a decoration. A small vegetable garnish would have made the plate. I think the plate was $29. It was overpriced for what was received"}
{"text":"I got the cheese ravioli and the Portion was sorta small for the price. Atmosphere is casual and very family friendly. I'll come back an maybe try something else. Servers we're VERY attentive and even gave us appetizers on the house!!"}
{"text":"This place had a very modern homey feel, good menu selections, make sure to ask for the bread it was great."}
{"text":"Best tasting food and dessert. Fast and excellent service . Try everything you can , don't miss the Nutella cake with salted caramel gelato . All pastas are great .. and the appetizer bread is a special mention"}
{"text":"I like the food here. Definitely a go-to spot when guests are visiting and need a family friendly spot for dinner where we can just meet them on the strip. The only thing is that they need new bust boys or more training. My first visit, they just weren't up to par esp on refilling the water. I don't remember too much on the last visit what my complaints were. It just wasn't good. 

Although tonight, it was crappy. My son was eating the cracker sticks and we placed the opened packet on top of the plates. The guy comes to pass out the plates but dumps the cracker onto the table. Literally took the plate and dumped it. Hello...my son was eating that and what kind of table manner/service is that. 

Then they came around with oil. He left and then a few minutes later came with bread. Our waitress finally asked if we wanted balsamic vinegar with it. I said yes, of course. I never had bread with just the oil! I guess the guys did that to the same table as well. 

Our waitress was good it's just the bust boys. They're not what I expect for a restaurant like that."}
{"text":"Came in with group of seven. Said 40 minute wait and was seated around 20 mins (so early).  Took a awhile to order food. And they were out of pizza at 8:30p (so I take it they are frozen)....  So not a good start to the night."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, but doesn't come close to actual Italian food. Basically a few steps above an Olive Garden. The service was great though and our waiter was attentive. Should have went next door and tried the desserts."}
{"text":"we were a large group and they convinced us to order off of a fixed menu family style. surprisingly, the portions were very very small for family style.
it was overpriced and the food was very average.  
I would never come back"}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything about this place!  We sat in there \"outdoor\" seating. It was freezing out when we were there so it was nice to pretend to be outside. While we were sitting their was a cute little skit/show. The bread and olive oil that came out was exceptional. The olive oil had a deep yellow-green color, there was no salt and pepper on our table. I would have liked to add a little for dipping. 
Chris ordered the pasta of the day, lasagna. SOOOO GOOD! The béchamel was layered thin with a great nutty flavor the sauce was light but flavorful and the cheese was gooie with small charred bubbles that still had their crunch when it got to our table. 
I ordered the charred octopus salad OH MY GOODNESS so so so so SO SO SO SO SO GOOD! I was a little iffy about the potato but I should have never doubted whoever made this salad lol. It was excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent service,  delicious food and live music for dinner (specific evenings)!  The best chicken picatta I've ever had and the desserts are divine.   The creme Brule is unlike any other.   The Nutella cake with the star of the plate. ..salted caramel ice cream.  The mac and cheese is also very unique with crunchy topping and decadent smokey flavor."}
{"text":"Great place for some good food and a nice stroll through the Venetian! The servers were friendly the second we walked! Would highly recommend, go again, and listen to the live music soon! Thanks Buddy."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorites in LAS.  Went there tonight with a friend all the while telling him how great the food and service was going to be.  Boy was I wrong.  While the food was adequate, the service was non-existent.  To get anything, we had to constantly flag down staff members.  While some may accuse me of being too picky, I think the fact that the restaurant did not have fresh grated parm cheese available (they claim their wheel broke) is a major blunder for an Italian themed restaurant.  I mentioned how poor the service was to one of the floor managers on our way out, and all she could say was \"Please don't let that stop you from coming back.\"  Really?  That's it?  Spend a couple of hundred dollars on dinner only to be told that?  I think it will be long time before I head back that way.  Which is too bad because the bone-in veal parm, with our without parm cheese, is really a wonderful dish. Ironically, shortly after we were seated, a table of 10 or 11 was seated next to us.  The wait staff fawned all over those folks and the chef even came out to meet the leader of their pack.  I guess we weren't high enough rollers to get the attention that we expected."}
{"text":"Fantastic, a MUST eat!!! The Caesar salad with melt-in-your-mouth croutons, the grilled cheesy bread appetizer, and the lasagna were absolutely delicious! Wife had the salmon and was thoroughly pleased with her meal as well. This will be my go-to Vegas restaurant for future visits, absolutely loved it. And that doesn't even speak for the service staff, they were absolutely excellent at what they do. Thank you for topping off and already fantastic night with Rascal Flatts!"}
{"text":"I must admit I was skeptical due to the fact that many of the celebrity restaurants in Vegas are not worth the hype, but Buddy has a winner with this one! The food was delicious, the service was exceptional, knowledgeable, and entertaining, and the atmosphere is lots of fun.

We had the Cesar salad, pepperoni pizza, spaghetti and meatballs, and bread with olive oil and butter. The bread and salads came out first and we couldn't get enough, they were so good! We ordered more bread even though we had pizza and pasta coming. The pizza was crispy and the flavors really popped, and the spaghetti and meatballs were perfection. We had a table where we could see the strip out the window, which was very pleasant and surprisingly serene. Our waiter was truly Italian and a riot. He made our dining experience even more enjoyable. 

I definitely recommend Buddies and make sure to check out his bakery across the way!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food/service was outstanding!  They cooked the pasta PERFECTLY and every item we got tasted delicious!  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try famous BuddyV restaurant and we arrived at happy hour time. Excellent food but very bad service. Hostess they do not communicate properly because we over waited for seat that while happy hour bar where was empty. We had to inquiry once more happy hour seat and were seated after some time. Food was excellent we took calamari,meat balls and meatballs sliders, 2 prosecco for great price of $4 each and we skip tiramisu due to slow service."}
{"text":"Food is so good, and the prices are reasonable...same prices as Italian chains. Service was excellent. My husband had the chicken parm and it pretty much melted in my mouth. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I wish there were more options on the menu, and options for gluten free individuals (besides salad)."}
{"text":"Wow, did I say wow? WOW! As soon as you've put your order in. The order is at you're table! How do they do that??? Start off with fantastic meatballs. The rigatoni with red sauce was outstanding! The carbonara dish was out of this world. Would it be bad to say go ahead and lick the bowls at the end?"}
{"text":"I'm a NY Italian living in Las Vegas. Most of the time I find it difficult to find great tasting Italian food like I've been accustomed to eating. My husband and I decided to try Buddy's for Easter dinner today. We started with the calamari which was perfectly fried. I usually prefer red sauce with mine, however, the sauce that came with it was really good. The slices of fried peppers were also a nice touch. For dinner I order the lasagna. It was so delicious and had a lot of great meats in it. I ended up bringing more than half of it home. My husband ordered the chicken parm which came with two large chicken breasts. We each had an iced tea and our bill was $80 and change. We skipped dessert and went across the way to Carlo's"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the noisiest place in Las Vegas (the casino is quieter). 
There is absolutely NO option for a conversation, the wait staff is so rushed you get your food handed from all different directions and from different staff each time. 
There is NO atmosphere only a mad rush of feed and fee then flee. 
The food is mediocre to poor and sadly the dessert was the worst plate of all!
What a let down."}
{"text":"Was in Las Vegas for a conference and always try to stay at the Palazzo.  It is a very nice hotel with lots of restaurant choices.

One of my favorites is Buddy V's.  They have great traditional Italian food that is simply prepared with the best ingredients.  The flavors and quality of the food for the price is pretty incredible for anywhere, but especially in Las Vegas.

One of my favorite dishes is the Bucatini Carbonara.  It literally calls my name sometimes.  The best carbonara I have ever eaten is in Austin, TX at a place called La Traviata, but I digress.

Buddy V's Bucatini Carbonara is pretty amazing.  It has just the right mixture of flavors and with the richness of the sauce is just amazing.  I have to confess I was a little high maintenance and asked for a flat pasta (linguine).
 
My dinner Caesar salad was large, but as Caesar salad go, pretty uninspired.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't up to the level of the pasta dish.

The wine list was reasonable (for Las Vegas) with several good selections by the glass.  Since I was dining alone, a bottle seemed an overindulgence.

If you are anywhere near the Palazzo, Buddy V's is a must.  You need to eat this food.  The one star deduct is for the just average Caesar salad.  Everything else was great."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on a Sunday evening as a party of two. The maître de was accommodating to our needs and had very good suggestions in accordance with our likings. The service was cordial and quick and not pushy. Personally we tried garlic bread, cheese ravioli with a white sauce ,and a pasta al la vodka. The garlic bread had the perfect portions of additives making it a great addition to our meal. The ravioli with our requested white sauce tasted phenomenal. Great cheese blend with an accommodating white sauce that was buttery but not too heavy. The vodka sauce was a phenomenal mix and just the right portion of red to white. Customer service was great, we look forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! There were 5 of us and we all loved our dishes... the only reason I am knocking it down a star is because our actual server did nothing for us - the bus boy did everything! And then the server took his own tip. Instead of giving us our change, he kept was was left ...so unfortunately for him that's all he got! 

We will probably be back before our trip ends!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. The meal I had was light and filling and the service was exceptional"}
{"text":"I had the chicken parm which was good. My husband had the scallops and they were delicious!  Not to heavy, just right portions. The garlic cheese bread was very good. The service was great!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food was amazing! And the portion sizes are crazy.  I went here with a group for a friends birthday and she absolutely loved the place. We were all pleasantly suprised with the food. The reason I gave this place only four stars is because of the service. The staff there were really nice but at times were too attentive (refilling the water after a simple sip...wait till my cup is at least half gone). All in all though I loved the place and so did all of my friends. We will definately be going back there next time we are in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Dining Experience!!!
Came to Las Vegas for our 30th Anniversary.  Used Yelp to pick a good restaurant near a concert venue in the Venetian.  
The waiter, Giorgio, was incredible.  Recommended the couples special that consisted of two appetizers, two/ three main courses and a dessert tray.  
Apps- meatballs and a meat and cheese sampling was a meal onto itself.  
Main Courses- Beef tenderloin in a red wine reduction, over mashed potatoes. Wow!
Grilled Sea Bass and Rigatoni. Unbelievable!!!
Finally, a tray of pure delight!!
Cookie Dough Gelato, Molten Chocolate Cake, Canoli and Tiramisu!! 
This place is so good!!
Do yourself a favor and ask for Giorgio, he makes the experience complete!!"}
{"text":"Our party of 7 wanted to eat here after the NCAA tournament basketball games and we were seated sooner than promised on a busy Saturday and st patty's day evening   .  Service was outstanding and food is delicious!  We had pizza, chicken Parmesan( very tender and large serving)  , eggplant Parmesan ( crispy and perfect!)  and Sunday sauce with rigatoni  which my husband loved !   Focaccia bread with olive oil was a great starter.  Definitely recommend and will return next year!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! The spaghetti and meatballs and chicken parm were the best I have ever had! The Nutella cake was chocolate heaven!!"}
{"text":"I chose Buddy V's for our 10 year anniversary reception dinner. We were a group of 12 people including two young kids and a preteen. When we arrived for our 6:30pm reservation, we were asked to go to the bar and wait for the table however once we all started to walk into the bar, the receptionist saw we had our two small kids with us and said that the kids could not be in the bar area. She told us to wait a few minutes and she would have the table rushed to get ready. A few minutes later it was ready, and we sat down at a nice large rectangular table near the open kitchen. At the time, I didn't think twice about the 'go to the bar' hand off but now that I am writing the review, I realize that this was mostly likely a way for them to get us to spend some additional money. 
Anyway, we sat and we chose to do the family style dining. Everything tasted amazing, the food just kept coming out. I waitress told me the chefs knew how much to serve, but it was clearly too much. A shame really, as a lot of it was boxed up but we were all staying in hotels with no available space in the frig (all weight sensitive booze filled frigs). I would recommend order your own dishes, according to your group appetite, and then share it all. Every dish we had was excellent. Meatballs, lasagna, pasta, sea bass all excellent."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised.  Granted, my friends and I stopped by just for a light lunch, so we didn't have any entrees.  But the eggplant parm appetizier, garlic bread and panzanella salad were superb!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try their happy hour, unfortunately when we went here last weekend around 515 pm the hostess said we need a reservation they are expecting 400 something reserved guests so they can't accommodate us. So I'm like it must be really good. I just find it weird when the time we tried to check in, the place isn't crowded inside there are even opened seats outside. So we decided to go the next day for their weekend bunch. It was a bit pricey $34.95 including drinks. Our server was nice and very attentive. Selection was not that many but it is a good food. The tomato basil soup was superb. Their apple sausage was tasty. I like how they have a small portions for kids meal too. I was able to get  Reese chocolate. I was a big fan of sweets so dessert is big deal for me. They have red velvet cake and bread pudding not to sweet but it was good."}
{"text":"Pizza and mimosa lunch perfect after a wild night . 
Terminando with a delicious cannoli. 
Fantastico!"}
{"text":"So I never watched the Cake Boss and only ended up at Buddy V's because they had space for our party during a busy Saturday night.  We were seated at the worst possible table in the restaurant right up in the front and the hostess wouldn't budge when I asked to be moved after I saw a lot of tables available since it was 9:30pm (strike 1).  Our waiter was fast talking and nice but he really tried his best to have us order more than we wanted and actually charged us for a salad which he said was going to give us compliments of the house and then forgot all about his promise at the end of the dinner (strike 2).  Those two experiences were the true reason why I brought the score down because the food (except for the salmon) was very fresh and delicious.  
Charred Octopus-amazingly good
Panzanella Salad-fresh combination of flavors
Seared Salmon-overcooked and dry (strike 3).
Buddy V's is a very large and pretty modern restaurant with decent prices but the little incidences along the way had me leaving on a sour note."}
{"text":"Awesome! We had the Brunch Buffet. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised when we came upon Buddy V's on accident. We just so happened to come during a time they were offering the buffet. I did not find a single thing offered that wasn't excellent! The service was prompt and helpful and the selections were tended to regularly so everything was fresh. Make your way here if you find yourself in the area, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I was at Buddy V'S on 10/3/14 I had Lasagna, which was good but it could of been better with more red sauce, the portion was great the price was high 27.00, the Focaccia bread was outstanding, they put us right in front of where they cook and there was a lot of noise, our server did a great job!!"}
{"text":"This place was fabulous !!! Our waiter was Giorgio and he was FABULOUS !! The food was also very amazing to top off the nice service! My friend and I had the bottomless mimosas/bellinis and our amazing waiter made sure our glasses were never empty! The food was amazing, as well as the desserts, my favorite was the cannoli, chicken parm, Mac & cheese and pasta salad ! Would recommend this place for anyone visiting Vegas! This was a great ending to our great vacation!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to drop in Saturday night to see if we can get a table without a reservation.  Unfortunately they were booked for the night, but the hostess asked if we'd like to sit at a high top at the bar.  Since they offered the full menu we readily agreed.  Within minutes of sitting down we had waters and our waitress greeted us.  The service was great and she happily gave recommendations.  We started with the calamari and it was excellent, the fried anahiem peppers were a great counterpoint to the calamari, which was cooked excellently.  I ordered  the chicken parm and my wife had the chicken picata.  My chicken parm was delicious!  It was two chicken breasts fried to perfection topped with mozeralla and a side of spaghetti with marinara.  I'm very picky about my marinara, I can't  stand when it's sweet, and this was done really well.  Very savory and went perfect with the chicken.  My wife's picata was cooked wonderfully as well but was lacking in the citrus.  She asked for a plate of lemons and was able to season to get desire.  We finished off the meal with a lobster tail dessert.  The pastry was beautifully done, the cream rich and smooth, and the berries tasted very fresh.  

All in all it was a great meal, my only gripe was the decor / ambiance.  It was like they couldnt figure out what they wanted to be.  The decor was that of a nice italian restaurant, low lighting and dark wood.  But their menus looked so cheesy like something from Farrels and the busers all wore bright red shirts but the hostesses wore little black dresses.  They need to go either elegant or cheesy, either would be fine but straddling the line is kinda weird."}
{"text":"This review is only for my pre-shopping Sunday drink experience :) I was just about to order a mimosa and the bartender was pouring what looked like a fresh pink-ish juice of some sort then topping with champagne. I asked what it was and she told me white peach juice. I had her make me a drink with the juice and it was delicious. She was very generous with the champagne and I really appreciated that. I hate paying for a drink of mostly juice. My mom and I had a couple of them and took off to do some shopping. 

I'd love to return to eat the brunch buffet because it looked delicious."}
{"text":"I do not like being cheated out of my money, and sadly, guys, that's exactly what they did to me here. This is the first time I have stopped by in years after claiming they have the best tiramisu. It was so HUGE. And now.....it comes in a mini mason jar. 

I understand businesses have to make money, but some dishes and desserts have become painfully small and remained at expensive prices, which is just plain sad. 

Furthermore, they try to trick you into paying for water now. Instead of offering tap water like they used to, they get rid of the option in their speech. 
--SO if you DON'T want to pay for nestle water, and they say \"Still or Sparkling?\"...SAY TAP. Don't pay for water unless you really want to. Because that is just a damn waste of $10 folks. 

They never used to trick me before, so I was totally not expecting this. I can't even rate them like I normally do, because I was so mad. 

The big points are: 
1) Their food is just average, so just skip it. 
2) The dessert is the better part of the meal, so if you want some, just go to Carlo's Bakery. 
3) They do have really good service, but they tricked me, so that was a little messed up since they didn't used to do that. It's totally what you expect restaurants that serve $80 per head to do. If you're going to do that, can't you at least do it during the more expensive dinner time?

I'm pretty mad, so it'll be a while when I come back, if ever."}
{"text":"We love the food, but today the service was terrible! The chicken parm is FANTASTIC! My husband loves the meatballs and the kids swear the pizza is the best. Usually the service is wonderful, but for whatever reason today the server was totally inattentive. Luckily the food is so good, we will come back."}
{"text":"I have been here every time I visit Vegas because we like it that much. The food is your typical italian food, but so much better tasting. I always get the three course meal they offer for $40 a person. It gives you some pretty good options for the appetizer, main dish, and dessert. The chicken parm is by far my favorite. The portion sizes are relatively large too which is great! Also, the service was fantastic as usual and we are never forgotten for too long. While it can be a pricey meal it is worth the food and restaurant setting. I would recommend trying this place on your visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service.  Excellent seat by window on Strip.  Super low lighting only negative.  Great value.  Mains are huge.  We shared."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Nice restaurant. Not much to complain about. The service was great. Our server was very nice, kept our waters filled and really seemed like he knew what he was talking about. The restaurant was very nice, good atmosphere. We came for lunch so it wasn't so busy so it was nice and peaceful. The food was good. The tomato sauce tasted a little canned but we only had 1 dish with sauce on it so over all it was good. Dessert was good as well. The tiramisu tasted very authentic. Over all a very nice restaurant."}
{"text":"I had brunch here and it was just ok. Not great and not bad. The service was good and the food was average."}
{"text":"Booked a reservation for my anniversary here, they sat us by a wall in the bar. In the bar?? Really!!?? We couldn't get a regular table or booth after booking a reservation? On top of that I mentioned that is was a special occasion as I booked and they never made any mention of it or brought out dessert for us. Service was awful, food was almost too salty to eat and way overpriced for the quality. I was extremely disappointed and embarrassed for taking my fiance here on our special day. Will never ever return!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! I had the chicken rigatoni and it blew me away! The canoli shells were incredibly flaky and rivaled my grandma's."}
{"text":"I am a baker, I love watching Buddy's Baking Show. I had to come here. Omg! I had the best Cannoli ever. Pure heaven. Hell if I could only work here, lol ... Love the bakery and next time around I definitly have to eat here. I cant wait to come back. Friendly employees and good customer service."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident and it was absolutely amazing! My boyfriend and I actually went twice when we were in town for the week. The calamari appetizer was tasty to start. The shrimp scampi is awesome and the gravy with rigatoni is delicious! Great service and atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! The waitress, Deanna was awesome. She was very helpful, gave a great recommendation for what we were hungry for and kept our glasses full.  The piano and band were very good in the background adding to the ambiance. We definitely recommend this place to anyone. Prices were fantastic compared to other places we ate at. We will be back for sure!  Thanks Deanna for making it a successful dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome all around. The food is amazing. Service spectacular and view is perfect. I give my highest rating and will come every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would. The food was amazing and our server was excellent! Georgio was absolutely incredible. He made dinner so much fun and even sang me happy birthday in Italian! He was awesome! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Everything is delicious! We had the salmon, cheese ravioli, shrimp scampi, chicken piccata and Caesar salad. The sauce is perfect. Service was quick and friendly. We only had to wait 30ish minutes. All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"We were at a party in the bar.  There were many foods laid out and an open bar.  The bartenders were up beat and helpful.  They never seemed stressed or impatient even though they were going full steam with many customers.  They took the time needed with each customer to serve them professionally with kindness.  
The bar area is open with easy access from the inside shopping area of the casinos.  There is adequate seating.  It is clean and the food is good. Everyone at the party seemed to be pleased."}
{"text":"Food is fresh, served quickly and delicious. I had the free range chicken which was good; but that was it. The potatoes, mushrooms and artichokes served with it were very little. My mom had the chicken Parmesan and it had pasta and two huge pieces of chicken. Much better value at a dollar less than the free range."}
{"text":"Who's not a fan of Buddy V? I drool over the eye candy on Cake Boss (the food eye candy!).  When I realized that Buddy brought Jersey to Vegas, I couldn't wait to try it. It's difficult to find a restaurant on the strip that has character, good food, and great service. Buddy V's has all three. We made reservations on a weekday evening and the restaurant was about 3/4 full. The ambiance was casual with an upscale Italian vibe; translation: fine dining without leaving a hole in your pocket. Win Win. There were two people taking care of our table, so we got double the attention and service. Both our waiter and waitress were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered \"My Wife's Eggplant Parm\" as an appetizer and chicken rigatoni alla vodka and Nonna's lasagna al forno as our mains. 

My Wife's Eggplant Parm- clever! I like how Buddy gives cred to those who deserve it. The eggplant parm was pretty much a tower of crispy goodness. Eggplant, melted mozzarella, tomato parm, eggplant, melted mozzarella, tomato, parm...you get the picture. The eggplant was had a nice crunch and the melty cheese and tart tomato sauce were a delicious combo. I'm using to a more traditional baked eggplant parm as opposed to the deep fried dish that was served. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I was missing the deep flavors of the eggplant that was fried away. 

Chicken rigatoni alla vodka- rigatoni, pancetta, grilled chicken swimming in a decadent tomato cream sauce was heaven. I really enjoyed the creaminess of this dish. The sauce was a perfect combination of flavors (it's all about the sauce). This pancetta was a nice touch of smokiness. Super filling, you will have leftovers! 

Nonna's lasagna al forno- YES. CHEESY, MEATY, traditional lasagna with a ton of flavor. This hefty lasagna had Italian sausage, beef and pork, ricotta cheese, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan baked to perfection. Four types of cheeses people. It was cheesy. If you are looking for a classic and delicious lasagna, look no further. The only thing I was missing was a bit of sweetness in the tomato sauce. Otherwise, I would absolutely order this item again. Totally big enough to split. 

I truly enjoy traditional Italian food. Big portions, big flavors and lots of sauce. Warning, you will be in a food coma after you finish your meal. Come with an empty belly and be prepared to eat. We had a ton of leftovers which is what should happen when you go out for Italian food. I enjoyed the decor of the restaurant, the ambiance, as well as the service. We let our waitress know that we were on a time crunch, and she got us in and out of the restaurant in no time with full bellies and smiles on our faces. This restaurant was closer to Palazzo then Venetian and somewhat of a mission to find, but we found it and we were glad we did. A very solid option of casual Italian food in the heart of LV."}
{"text":"An unexpectedly good place to eat, we didn't really have a look online on where to eat, just went to the casino and picked a restaurant. We didn't realise it belonged to that 'Buddy' from the TLC cake boss until we sat down. There was virtually no wait at all and we got a table within minutes. The service was wonderful and the staff seemed well organised and knew what they were doing. We were given fresh bread to start off with, just like an authentic Italian resturant. Then we ordered the Sunday gravy and the mac and cheese. Both dishes were full of flavour and was delicious! It was a perfect amount of food for 2 people, however it was such a shame we couldn't squeeze dessert in."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with reservations. The service is excellent. The servers and employees are very welcoming and check in on you. As for the food, my wife and I both had the prix fixe menu for $40/person which include an appetizer, entree, and desert. I had mama's meatballs and the chicken Parmesan, along with the tiramisu. All of the food was out of this world. My wife had the Caesar salad, chicken Parmesan, and Canoli. She really enjoyed the food. Also, I should mention that the restaurant overlooks the strip and has an awesome view. Come here. It is reasonably priced with great service and awesome Italian food."}
{"text":"Solid Italian food.

I had the lasagne which was delicious. My wife the chicken picatta.  She loved the pasta but thought the chicken was just ok.  They only give you one piece of bread at a time, would be nice to have a basket of bread on the table instead of having to ask everytime you ate the one piece they served you. 

Ordered the meatballs for an appetizer, they were very good.

Overall a nice meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"I'm always down for Italian as a safe favorite. After a long day of traveling, we weren't really sure what we wanted, and Buddy V's had availability on a Friday night. 
I got the dinner deal that came with an app, entree, and dessert, while my BF got pasta with vodka sauce. 
The Caesar salad was fantastic! The croutons were the best croutons I have ever had. They were piping hot with soft centers. 
My chicken parm was apparently the thing to get (I listened to everyone else's suggestions). It was so much food and very tasty. 
My BF's pasta with vodka sauce was good, but he said it tasted like a dish you could get anywhere. Nothing too special 
The tiramisu for dessert was good, and had little shortbread cookies for dipping. 

Overall, I liked the ambiance and location (within the Venetian), but it wasn't anything super standout. Should've just stuck with his cake shop across the hall!"}
{"text":"I had a couple of friends in town to celebrate a 21st birthday. We tried a few options; the club, people watching, etc but it wasn't living up to The Experience (although I am local) for my friends. We ended up stopping by at Buddy V's and Joy, the bartender there, completely turned our night around... From her wonderful personality to the detail she put into creating and explaining our cocktails - THAT is what Vegas is about. The experience. We didn't plan on being there last night but we spent a good 2-3 hours there having a wonderful time and joy ended up giving my friend the experience we were all looking to get."}
{"text":"Buddy V's is a great Vegas strip experience.  The Brunch is fantastic , and a window seat for people watching is a fun way to chill out while you sample their unlimited drink option. We tried the sangria with brandy and fresh fruit, the pomegranate mimosa, and the Bloody Mary with a full condiment station. All were superlative, we sampled them over and over.

The brunch is done buffet style but with small trays that are refilled  frequently.  The antipasto/charcuterie table is outstanding we selected a great blue cheese variant, prosciutto, shrimp, focaccia and cheesy bread. The chef's corner entrees were fantastic, the standouts were the mac n' cheese carbonara, Sunday eggs, and crepes with in-house whipped cream and an amazing compote that was entirely comprised of fresh berries. The carving station had delicious sausages and a sumptuous slab bacon that was more like pork belly. At most brunch buffets the deserts are so-so but this is the cake boss's place so they were all incredible the exceptional items were the cannoli, zeppoli, and Italian cookies platter. 

The service was friendly and accommodating regardless of how busy the restaurant became."}
{"text":"Came for my mother's birthday. Let me tell you about my mother:
- She was born in Calabria, Italy
- Loves Italian food (given), but almost never goes out for Italian food since we have it with family often and her standards are high.
- She does not like to spend money, everything is compared to a cheaper alternative and rarely thinks money is well spent at restaurants. 

Our waiter hyped up the family style dining experience, which we usually do on our own. The fact they had a program to do so was great to hear, and it did not disappoint.

The food was amazing. Exceeded all of our expectations. We had a great spread that really covered all the bases from the menu. One dish was better than the next.

The waiter, Georgio, was the best in the business. I've eaten at great restaurants around the world and had great service but he was truly world class and made the night. He was funny and entertaining but did not overdue it. Sometimes you get a funny or personable waiter who you like but they are too busy chatting they forget a request or get distracted, but not Georgio. He even sang happy birthday to my mother in Italian which really was the icing on the cake. 

It was a night to remember, thank you to Buddy V's for making it special!"}
{"text":"We walked and walked and walked and walked..... this place is hard to find! After going on a mission to find this spot for something sweet - my two friends said it all looks like supermarket bakery items and didn't order- wtf? We worked too hard to get here! I ordered a hazelnut mini cream puff (about $3 or $4 I don't remember exactly- a little pricey for its size but not crazy). The ordering part sucks ballls! You order with one person then another bags it up, while you wait on yet another line to pay then another to pick up.  There were only 4 people in front of me and this ordeal took 20 minutes! This is where they lost a star.  I finally got my little golden chocolate hazelnut nugget- and OMG!! So good.  Worth all the hassle- I didn't even share with my friends- who judged this pastry by its cover."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Cake Boss and was excited to come here. A bit hidden in the Shops at the Canal This has place delicious authentic Italian food. We did not have to wait to be seated, with a view of The Strip. The service was great. And the food exceeded every expectation we had. We started with the tomato and basil soup and was so good that we wanted to order some more (and I'm not a tomato soup person). We ordered the chicken rigatoni \"alla vodka\" and it tasted amazing. It was rich and creamy. We also got the roasted sea bass with arugula salad and it was a great choice too. We went big on desserts with the Italian birthday cake, a layered sponge cake, YUM! And the lobster tail also great. If you want rich Italian food with an Italian feel don't look any further. He also has the Carlos Bakery across from here. Didn't get a chance to go but the pastries looked delish."}
{"text":"So let me just start by saying the food here is amazing.  The drinks are meh, but the pasta was DELISH!

The reason why my review is so low is because our server sucked.  I'm not some snooty restaurant goer either.  I used to work in a restaurant, so I know how it's not hard to be an okay server.  However, that being said, we were there for a Bachelorette dinner, and we had maybe 2 small interactions with our waiter.  He was extremely show, didn't check on us once, but decided to charge us extra for some souvenir cups we didn't ask for and failed to inform us that a smaller bottle of water was $10 each.  We waited for 30 min after we were done eating for him to come by to us and check if we wanted anything else or our bill.  Horrible service and really disapointed about this restaurant as I'm a huge Cake Boss and Buddy fan.  If the service improves by a lot, then I'll be back, but until then, I'd rather be checking out other restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"This is the first time I didn't bite into a tiny pice of rock in my clam linguine  The service was excellent. I would tell my friends who like to eat to come here.  Buddy's bakery is right across from the restaurant. Yum yum. ."}
{"text":"This food is like Ragu.  Really, I am losing trust in Vegas yelpers.  :P
I got the special sauce with meat, the one with lamb, meatballs, sausage in sauce which came with some type of tube pasta.  The sauce was so bland.  Maybe add some oregano, basil, less tomato paste, I don't really know what it is.  The lamb was okay, the balls were okay, the sausage wasn't bad.  The pasta was nothing special.  Though if you go, hubby enjoyed the chicken parmesan, so give that a go.  We didn't stay for dessert, I wasn't feelin' it.

But the waitress was fantastic!  She was really polite and I noticed she had a rude customer and she kept smiling.  The drinks were okay, the bread was eh and the Cesar salad was heavily dressed, but wasn't bad.  I enjoyed the croutons in the salad."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Went in for Happy Hour. Sat down and waited. No one approached for almost 10 minutes and then only to tell us us the table we were at wasn't for Happy Hour. We moved to the bar and sat for another ten minutes. Bartender was not around when he did come into view,
He never looked our way ignoring us completely. We finally gave up and left. It wasn't that busy to not even be acknowledged! Too bad!"}
{"text":"Visited the Ristorante for my daughter's birthday. The food was excellent. I had the eggplant parmigiana. The ambiance was great. I really enjoyed the feel of the place. It was a bit loud, yet i enjoyed the hustle and bustle around me. It added to the character of the place. The only issue that I had was that our waiter was not very attentive. On arrival, we had him store a birthday cake that we bought at Carlo's Bakery so that we can sing happy birthday and have the cake for dessert. It took the a very long time to take out order and being our drinks. The food took even longer. He did not stop by our table to check on our refills or if we needed anything. We had to flag him down each time we needed something. It seemed like we were in the restaurant forever because the service was so slow. We could no longer wait on him so we asked for our cake and decided to bring it back to the hotel.  Other than that, I loved everything about the place and plan on visiting again."}
{"text":"Great dinner tonight. The service was excellent as was the food. Lately, whenever we go for Italian I order chicken piccata and tonight was no exception. It was delicious. My daughter enjoyed her \"Mac and cheese\" and my hubby loved his sea bass. Our server suggested a wine which was great and the cannoli for dessert was one of the best we've ever had. I would definitely return and recommend!"}
{"text":"The cheese ravioli was good. Service wasn't great. Our server Peter J seemed pretty put out by us being there. Never got the Pepsi I ordered. He catered to the other tables and made us feel very unwelcome."}
{"text":"The food was good. The child's cheese pizza was big and delicious. The chicken piccata had a great white wine sauce and the capers were delicious. My wife enjoyed the chicken Parmesan and couldn't finish the lunch portion. The price was decent for Vegas (lunch, about $17 per person). 

The only reason it didn't score higher was the service was VERY slow. We had to ask for water multiple times and generally had to follow up with our waitress quite a bit. 

We would come back again."}
{"text":"Boring average Italian food that lacked adequate service.  There are much better places to spend your vacation dollars."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and have been very impressed both times! The service was great!
The food is amazing. Best pizza ever. The crust is the perfect combination of soft and crisp. Tomato sauce has just enough spice. My kids, who aren't sausage lovers, thought the sausage was amazing!

I have also had the vegetable salad which has just a little lettuce and TONS of vegetables. The steak - tender, juicy!

I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food, ate here two nights in a row because it was THAT good!

Sunday Gravy is incredible, sorry to say but better than my mom and grandmas...and I'm Italian!
Garlic Bread is killer!

Excellent place to get authentic Italian, service is great and vibe is not stuffy like most Vegas celebrity restaurants. 

Lobster tail for desert!!"}
{"text":"Great dinner with the family to celebrate moms bday in Vegas.  After walking and shopping in the Venetian we opted for Buddy's so that we can get Carlo's bakery cannoli's right after. The restaurant was beautifully decorated with various seating options. We were seated in a quieter room next to a window that overlooked the strip!! We started off with sangria to share and calamari! The calamari was flavorful and crisp! Even the cut lemons were edible! The sangria was perfect with our pasta, fish, and steak dinner.  I couldn't decide between red sauce or clams so our server was kind enough to get me a side of pomodoro sauce.  My dad enjoyed his steak that was cooked evenly throughout with a nice semi glaze.  My moms salmon was seasoned well and my sisters chicken picante was tender.  Overall, a great dinner in a beautiful setting!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice. Once for happy hour and the other for Sunday Brunch. Both times the food and service were amazing!! Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Not bad considering the expectations - mine were a little on the lower side based on Buddy's Cake Boss background. Pretty fast and friendly service -bussers were always making sure you don't go thirsty. Portion sizes are on the larger side, but leftover pasta is always great. The sunday gravy special is pretty solid, perfect for a meat lover - spicy sausage, pork, meatballs. Rigatoni and the sauce were pretty good. Orrechiete sausage pasta had good texture and flavor as well. For dessert the warm nutella cake was their most popular- it was great. Cannoli was unfortunately not as tasty and had a strong cinnamon flavor that somehow reminded us of Fireball whiskey - not that pleasant. Overall not bad, not great. 
3.75/5."}
{"text":"Went specifically for the creekstone farms burger. It was a decent burger. It didn't amaze me neither did it disappoint. Cooked medium like I requested and it was juicy with some nice greasiness. I appreciated the grilled brioche bun and the nice melty cheese. Their tomato aioli (cough mayo) added very little. The burger could prolly use a stronger compliment to the meat and cheese. The Parmesan dusted fries paired well with the burger. Overall I was pretty happy with it. Also happy with as many restaurants using creekstone farms as possible."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! My friend and I came here for dinner on my birthday weekend before going to see Mysteré across the street. We had the garlic cheese bread as an appetizer, which was AMAZING. Seriously we both moaned upon the first bite. For my main entrée, I got the Chicken Rigatoni and it was soooo good! The portion size was perfect and the pasta was very delicious! For dessert I got the italian donuts which were also delicious! My favorite was the strawberry one, but the chocolate was a close second! Our server was awesome too, he was very attentive and we never went too long without seeing him. I would definitely come back to Buddy V's!"}
{"text":"Food here was fantastic. We came here last minute without a reservation. The wait was about 30 minutes, but we were able to get seated at the bar right away. 

Service was good and the bartender was friendly. The Nutella lava cake was probably one of the best desserts I've ever had.

Minus one star for high prices, and small portions."}
{"text":"Dont overlook this as a celebrity chef-outrageous hotel hyped prices. The service was alright but the food is really good, with prices reasonable! I split the orrechiate and the portions were large despite splitting it. The pasta was some of the best Ive had and the side fries were really good too. Overall, I paid $25 for dinner which is not bad at all for Vegas dinner prices."}
{"text":"Seeing as my awesome bf let me drag him into all of the restaurants I wanted to go while we were in Vegas when he said he wanted Italian food for brunch on Sunday I gladly obliged.

They had a buffet set up and for $34.95 we got to choose from an array of antipasto, pasta, meats, soups and desserts. We also took the option for all you can drink for only $16.95 additional which included peach Bellini, mimosas, sangria, domestic beer and wine. 

I took full advantage of the cheese board/antipasto area and filled my plate with prosciutto, salami, Gorgonzola, pecorino and focaccia bread. The marinated olive mix with peppers was delicious! Must try this. Also grabbed some iced peel and eat shrimp that had a nice spice to them that I wasn't expecting, but enjoyed. 

Chicken parm was a bit soggy from sitting in the hot tray unfortunately. Orecchiette and sausage pasta was simple, but great and probably my favorite thing. 

Loved the Italian sausage, did not really like the chicken apple sausage. 

Tiramisu was awesome. Cannolis were just ok in my book. 

Great place for families to dine and well worth the price tag for the brunch buffet."}
{"text":"We went to Buddy B's for their Sunday Brunch to celebrate my  birthday. It was fun and delicious! $35 for the buffet that had an antipasto station, carving station, dessert station, breakfast and lunch station and a kids station. Then there we bottomless mimosas, bellinis, sangria and beer for $15! And bottomless bloody mary's with a do it yourself bar for $16! Non-alcoholic beverages were included. Everything was delicious! My favorite was the pasta carbonara. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Buddy V's wins for best happy hour on the Strip! The bartender was super helpful and fast. The portions for HH aren't that large but allow for a taste of a variety of options. We had the meatballs, calamari, ricotta and polenta-all delicious! The sangria was AMAZING! If I was eating on just the HH it would have received five stars!

After HH we sat down and had dinner. The majority of the courses were excellent. I didn't like how the waiter pushed more food than was necessary. I also had the veal piccata and it wasn't that good. Eating starved baby cows only happens once a year for me and it wasn't worth it on that meal. The cheesy garlic bread was very delicious. I would definitely return for the HH but probably wouldn't eat in the main restaurant."}
{"text":"I recommend stopping here if you want some Italian, in Las Vegas. It's located by the Shops in the Venetian.

We both got the Prix Fixe and it was so good! It seemed a little pricey at $40/person, but for what you get, it's better deal than you would think at first glance. 

The complimentary bread they bring for you to dip in oil & vinegar is as a type of a focaccia, so delicious. I don't care for Balsamic vinegar, so the waitress kindly brought some marinara for me, and that sauce was perfect. I chose the panzanella side salad, which was so huge and packed with goodness. They didn't just throw some salad mix on a plate! Very fresh, croutons made in-house and packed with flavor. The cheese, the tossed-in dressing, all in perfect proportion to the greens. Also noted that they halved the grape tomatoes, which is a sign to me that they pay attention to detail. (I love the taste, but hate biting into a whole grape tomato and having it burst.) 

As entree, I had the Bucatini Carbonara, which is a dish I am super picky about, and it was the best I've ever had! Pasta was perfect and I could have easily saved half, if I was a little less hungry, or it was less delicious. As it was, there was such a generous portion, I didn't finish it. 

My guy had Orecchiette and Italian Sausage. It looked lovely, and had some red peppers, broccolini, roasted tomatoes, and the spicy Italian sausage. Really, all the flavors he loves. I tried a bite, and it was fantastic. 

The wine  Paolo Scovino Dolcetta d'Alba 2013- was great pairing with pasta, just enough sweet and mild acidity and richness to be a wonderful accompaniment to the meal. It's a variety I hadn't tried before, so I have a new love. 

Tiramisu was beautiful and flavorful, not too much of any of the ingredients, and a couple of lady fingers on the side. My guy finished his cannoli in about 3 minutes, as well, so I'm assuming he liked it. 

All in all, Excellent! We were stuffed and happy, and the service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm sorry,  a restaurant of this calibre and it ran out of honey to serve with tea....  Unacceptable.  Oh yes,  I forgot to mention that no milk was served with coffee... It had to be asked for after trying to hunt down the server.. 

Although this may seem like a small thing the attitude of the server goes a far way to contribute to the star rating given. 

The whole experience was marred with slow service,  inefficiency and smacked of a back street joint rather than the upmarket restaurant it is supposed to be. 

Guys it is the small things that that matter,  big name but small on performance....  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Best value for lunch.  Appetizer, main corse and dessert for $22. For the Venetian or anywhere on the strip it was a great deal and very good food. I had Caesar salad, carbonara pasta and tiramisu - all great. My friend had salad, pizza and cannoli - again excellent.  Service was good also."}
{"text":"This was hands down one of the top places I've ever eaten. Amazing food, beautiful cozy and inviting atmosphere and the service was phoenomial to say the least! I believe our servers name was Georgio? Not positive on the name but he was spectacular! SUPER friendly, helped us find great drink and food choices based on what we were looking for. Answered  every question we had thoroughly, he was quick and effiecient, even made us laugh and took a picture for us before we left! Of course knowing this is the 'Cake Boss' restaurant, needless to say the dessert was on point. The drinks...they were certainly not messing around with a lack of alcohol but it wasn't so much to ruin the flavor of the drink! With their current special, depending on what drink you get, you can take the glass home. Overall lovely experience and I wish we had on in Kansas City!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the bar for a quick drink. Joy, the bartender, was awesome! Best customer service in the whole casino hands down. Oh and not to mention she makes a hell of a drink. I told her to get me whatever and I was not disappointed. She knows her way around a bar inside and out. Not only was she great, the whole restaurant was amazing. Very relaxing, and a great view if you get a window table. I recommend this place to anyone going to the strip looking for a relaxing time with superb individuals!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation and was given the worst table there! Stuck at a small table when there was plenty of seating. This angered my bf who preceded to order something small for the both of us. Food was good but restaurant seating sucked!!"}
{"text":"My first Buddy V's experience was truly amazing! It was Sunday Brunch so I was expecting the typical all you can eat eggs and bacon. There was nothing typical about the fabulous offerings. 

First the all you can drink package included way more variety than what you usually get at a \"champagne brunch\". The options included certain wine, beer, bloody marys, mimosas, sangria AND bellinis. We ended up trying almost everything and I can't say a bad word about any of it. The fruit was so fresh and delicious in the sangria and the red wine and champagne were top quality. 

 The service was prompt and the waiters and bussers were extremely attentive. Our glasses were never empty, our table was never dirty. The staff was also helpful in making sure we knew where everything was and offered suggestions on the food and drinks. 

Speaking of food... The first thing I noticed was that the food was put out in small batches to keep everything fresh. You could really taste the freshness. The Italian offerings were obviously great and I couldn't believe the antipasto area. Everything was so delicious from the fresh, perfectly cooked shrimp to the very flavorful meatballs. I barely left room for dessert. I was able to take one little bite of most things and well... there are no words!

I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great Place to eat!
My husband and I were staying at the Venetian and stopped in Buddy V's for lunch. 
I would highly recommend this place, reasonable prices and amazing food!
The server and hostess were so sweet I asked their names and it was Joy and Emily. So friendly and made great suggestions. 
Next time we are in Vegas this is a must for us!
You will not be disappointed or feel ripped off with the prices!"}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: A bustling restaurant with dim lightning, large plates, and good service make this a great place to bring friends.

Try:
Spaghetti Pomodoro
Chicken Rigatoni Alla Vodka

Pro:
While the restaurant is usually quite lively, they separate the tables out in a way that makes conversation possible, which is usually an afterthought nowadays. The service was quick and practically invisible, which can be good or bad, depending on your preference.

The food itself was simple, solid Italian. You won't be disappointed, nor will you be blown away. It's a safe choice for a good evening out.

Con:
If you have a large party, you'll have to be split up amongst several tables."}
{"text":"Ate at Buddy V's for lunch yesterday. Ordered the calamari and Garlic bread for appetizer. The bread was crispy and cheesy, it was good. Calamari was big and the jalapeños in it gave it a nice flavor. My husband ordered the meatball sub. The meatballs were lacking a little flavor and I would have liked more cheese, but the sauce had good flavor and the roll it came on was soft. I ordered the chicken piccata. I really liked it. The chicken was pounded thin and the sauce was a little thick and it was the perfect mixture of lemon and capers. I LOVED the Italian birthday cake! It was vanilla cake with a chocolate filling and there was cannoli filling too. It was to die for. It was not overly sweet either and it's definitely big enough to share, but I wouldn't...;)"}
{"text":"I really liked the lasagna!  Very nicely done!  The chocolate molten lava cake was to die for too!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to have Italian on a Friday night and made reservations.  It was painless and pleasant.  

We were seated promptly at the reservation time and greeted for drinks and water immediately.  I also noticed some plastic packages on the table that resembled chopstick containers and discovered they were mini breadsticks.  Yum.   

We ordered salads and the calamari appetizer and they also brought out complimentary bread and olive oil.  Everything was perfect as was the Pino Noir and Cabernet we were drinking.  

For the meals everyone tried different dishes which were almost all shared by the time the dinner was over.  We had eggplant parmigiana, chicken parmigiana, spaghetti and meatballs and cheese ravioli.  Everything was spot on and delicious. 

I finished my meal off with an espresso and two others shared a butterscotch creme brûlée.  As expected everything was perfect.  

As you may see from my reviews, I eat out often and across the globe.  This meal, service, ambiance and decor were as good as it gets.  Me and my 3 other guests all had a memorable time and will be back again.  If I can complain about anything, it would be that they should have linen table cloths on the tables instead of the rustic looking wood surface.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Probably the best tasting Italian restaurant I have ever been to! We ordered the Panzenella salad, shrimp scampi and chicken parm, and everything was delicious. The chicken was served with a side of spaghetti which totally redefined how incredibly tasty spaghetti can be.
The staff and servers were friendly and professional, the atmosphere was upscale yet casual, and I fully intend to return the next time I visit Las Vegas. One word of advice: Bring coats as they keep the air conditioning at a very uncomfortably cold temperature."}
{"text":"First time visitor to this restaurant. I'm Italian, I've travelled the world eating amazing food and I will admit right away, my dining experience was average. First time ever I was not offered bread in an Italian restaurant. I ordered grilled salmon and a side of capellini with \"tons of garlic\".  The salmon was on a bed of cold, uncooked vegetable. Really? I had to send the $7.00 side of capellini back because they forgot to put any garlic in it.  My wine (Super Tuscan) was very good but I don't appreciate drinking a $16.00 glass of wine out of a cheap ass wine glass. Have you heard of crystal wine glasses? Given all of the options in Vegas, I would not come back. First time ever I was not offered bread in an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Did you know the owner of this place is like a famous chef or baker or something? Yea, I didn't know either....but I was schooled by my boyfriend's 60-something year old mom. Learn something new everyday!

Our party of 8 came here around 10:30pm on a Sunday evening. We got seated quickly, even with our big party. None of us were very hungry, so we ordered all appetizers or small dishes and a couple of drinks. 

My boyfriend and I shared a Margherita Pizza (definitely big enough for two -- has about 8 small pieces). Both my boyfriend and I agreed that the pizza was really tasty! We happily ate the whole thing. It was cooked just right and was hot and steamy when it got to our table. Just the way I like it! I also ordered a Salad...I don't remember the name of it, but it was decent sized and tasted fresh. I was so full on pizza, I couldn't eat my whole salad. I definitely could have just done one or the other. 

I don't remember what the rest of my party ordered. There was a variety of dishes, but they all must have been good because I don't remember anything left on anyone's plate when we were done. This means the food was delicious! Or else we were all just hungry. Either way, it was good overall. 

Service was great. Our server was friendly and personable. I like that when it comes to servers!

My only gripe was that our food took forever to come out. We waited a good 15+ minutes before anything came out. That was a long time considering they weren't that crowded or busy when we were there. They may need to work out some kinks in the kitchen. 

On a side note, this restaurant has good views of the strip. I really liked that, and I spent awhile gazing out at the bright lights and the busyness of the strip. Good people watching!

Overall, I enjoyed my time at Buddy V's. I would definitely come back here again on another visit to Vegas!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian food in Las Vegas. We were in a party of 8, so they offer a \"family style\" dinner (bringing out multiple courses for the table to share). All courses were delicious!"}
{"text":"Having enjoyed dinner shortly after opening with friends in town from Phoenix, the plan to re-visit Buddy V's at a later date somehow getting lost in the constant shuffle of Las Vegas' restaurant landscape, recent rumors from a trusted source suggested that the All You Can Eat Sunday Brunch pairs a good price to food better executed than it needs to be, something each day more difficult to find in the Casino properties of Sin City.

No doubt still a hot-spot amongst tourists, the restaurant itself just under capacity by noon as the line at Carlo's Bake Shop continues to snake out the door at all hours of the day, it was just past 11:15am that one adult and a child checked-in at the hostess podium to be quickly led to a tight two-top adjacent the open kitchen, food displays tempting on all sides as the décor of rolling pins, whisks and ingredients continues to impress without making the environment feel like a 'theme' restaurant in the least.

Half-expecting service to be sub-par, most of the full-time Buffets in town generally better suited to this style of dining than a place converting the dining room into a free-flowing event once a week, it was with greetings from a young man who poured water and occasionally returned to clear plates or refill Coffee that instructions were given to \"get started whenever you like,\" a quick perusal of the options that are mostly laid out on the tableside menu showing a decent variety, though certainly not the same multitude of options as the Hotel's AYCE space.

Obviously focusing on Italian American classics and Buddy's interpretation of the topic by way of long-time Chef Brian Forgione, it was with a plate of Charcuterie, Cheese and Baked Goods that the meal got underway, the 9-year old happy to see Peel n' Eat Shrimp offered, but confused as to why the Salami did not taste like the version offered at Von's, the quality theoretically superior and not nearly as processed but nonetheless lacking in flavor while the Prosciutto, Blue Cheese and Pecorino were all good specimens, though the Focaccia was nearly inedible and hard enough to make one wonder whether it had been baked the previous day.

Modestly impressed by the Croissant as well as two mini-Muffins, a Pain au Chocolat entirely forgettable as a result of too little filling, the decision to investigate the Cake Boss' desserts early was well served by a pot of Tiramisu that would rival any in town, the Red Velvet Cake also quite tasty with a most base and tangy frosting while the Cannoli was much like that across the way, already feeling the sog of being pre-filled and generally underwhelming.

Batting about .500 on Italian Cookies, the Almond Cluster and soft Chocolate far better than the dried Butter rounds topped in Sprinkles or Jam, it was with patience that a fresh pan of pasta was waited on as part of plate three, the Mac n' Cheese Carbonara far too heavily salted to be appreciated for any sort of subtlety while the small Breasts of pounded Chicken Parm and Orecchiette with Italian Sausage were better balanced if not particularly memorable, the surprisingly light Roast Vegetable Frittata offering some evidence of a kitchen that is capable of doing 'high volume' right.

Far more impressed by the Garlic Bread than the Focaccia, crispy and fragrant with just melted Mozzarella or when used to scoop up Grandma's Meatballs and Sauce that takes no short-cuts en route to a fresh Tomato flavor without any added sweetness, choices from the carving station including Spicy Italian Sausage and Smoked Applewood Slab Bacon are well-displayed and prepared properly, the youngster at the table also fond of the Maple-Glazed Ham and sticks of Beef Jerky procured from the Bloody Mary Bar.

Going back to the sweet stuff for plates five and six, the common occurrence of dirty stacked plates and an empty mug at this point almost more amusing than it was an annoyance, fans of Bread Pudding would be well advised to save room for Dessert as the version served hot from a steamer with Caramel Sauce and Whipped Cream is a custard-laden masterpiece that far outperformed Panettone French Toast that is a bit dry along the edges, a better investment for the sweet tooth being the dainty Crespelle served with Nutella, Pureed Raspberries and Whipped Cream...or perhaps a bag of piping hot Italian Donuts offered with the same trio for dipping.

**1/2Charged $36.95 per adult and $10.95 for a child, a price not inclusive of tax or tip, the question of whether Buddy V's Brunch is 'worth it' comes down to whether one prefers quality or quantity as well as an understanding of celebrity Chef branding, the recent Buffet upgrades at Wynn, Cosmopolitan and Caesar's seemingly a better value with superior service, though certain items and the chance to sample several of Buddy V's Signatures without investing in a full lunch or dinner seems worth it for fans or those looking for a family-friendly alternative to Grand Lux Cafe while staying at the Venetian"}
{"text":"Service...slow
Meatballs are excellent! (That is the only reason why I would give this place a 4 star)
Our table had lasagna, chicken parm and vodka rigatoni. 
The lasagna received raves from my niece. The rest of the food was sub par at best. I definitely would not get the rigatoni again...ever! 

Loud, yet fun atmosphere. Friendly staff. The management was helpful."}
{"text":"Wow what can I say about this place. Let me start by saying we had high hopes for this place. However, the reality is that this place was mediocre at best. I will start with the good. The service was good, the meatball appetizer was good, and the fresh bread was great. This is where it stops, the spaghetti was somewhat chef boyardee tasting and the chicken parmigiana lacked flavor. Consequently the only flavor from that dish was from the cheese, which was all cheese no chicken. At this point the wife and I chalk it up to a loss and believing the hype and figures hey the desert has to be good, after all it's the cake boss right. WRONG!!!! This was probably the most disappointing part of the meal we got the cannoli and tiramisu. The cannoli was bland and lacked any depth and the tiramisu was also boring lacked any real flavor and to boot was but in a small Masson jar. Oh let's not forget the cookies that were served with the cannoli they were as hard as a biscotti. Now I can chalk up the good as a loss but the desert really?! That should have been second to none. The bottom line, if you want good Italian food and dessert go anywhere else but this overrated excuse of an Italian restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Was here a couple years ago. It was great then and still great today. That kind of consistency is rare in Vegas. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had a reservation at 7. Arrived a little late but we were seated shortly after our arrival. Our booth was right next to the window so we had a view of the strip. Service was very slow though. Waiter was very pushy on what he wanted us to drink. I wanted to drink a sangria but instead he insisted I tried some other wine. Food was okay but nothing spectacular. Had the birthday cake for dessert and the alcohol taste was VERY strong."}
{"text":"Buddy V's is mall food at best.  Not bad but not great either.  We were a group of 12 and our waiter was in overdrive pushing the bill up.  We asked about ordering family style, he had us each order an individual dish and we left a ton of food behind.  He recommended the veal to each one of us (the most expensive item) and when I ordered chicken picatta he asked if he could bring veal picatta instead.  Same for wines."}
{"text":"The food... Eh, what your paying for is the view and the establishment... Drinks are over priced as well as the food. But it is a place for big groups with $ to spend"}
{"text":"As a Las Vegas local, I try to avoid the strip restaurants as much as possible.  They're usually over priced, and over crowded, but when I found myself at the Venetian with my wife and daughter, we swung into Buddy V's on a whim for lunch.  

My wife and I are typically appalled by kids menus because everything tends to be fried, or bathed in cheese; Buddy V's was no exception.  With that said, I ordered the kids chicken parm, however I requested the dish be with a grilled chicken breast, and no cheese. Our waitress gladly made the change, and my daughter loved the food. $12.00 for a kids meal is a little pricy, but it is the strip after all, and the food was a big hit with my daughter. I don't mind paying for quality.

The lunch menu is a little small, and I was wishing I'd looked at it before getting a table, I figured I'd just grab something with little expectation.  Big mistake! I ordered the adult chicken parm, and my wife had the chicken blt.  The pasta with the chicken parm was slightly al dente, and perfectly cooked. The chicken breading was crunchy with juicy chicken inside. 

My wife was a big fan of the thin piece of chicken that came on her sandwich, and the perfectly toasted bread.  The basil was fresh and tomato not mushy, another big hit.

I would have given a higher rating of not for the poor service.  Our waitress, Bethany, disappeared from our table for 20+ minutes. She took our order, and didn't come back until it we'd been finished eating for quite some time.  All in all, we'd come back for the food but the service needs some work. Out total bill was $57.62."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Very nice ambiance with lots of decorations to look at and a semi open kitchen.  High ceilings so it doesn't feel cramped or dark.  Comfortable seating.  Excellent food.  My girlfriend and I shared the Caesar and it was a very nice portion with polenta instead of croutons.  So good!  She loved her shrimp scampi and I loved my veal Marsala as both were recommended by our server.  Everything tasted fresh and real.  Service was attentive and genuine.  I loved that there a nice view of the strip as well.  Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"The service was so good they were so nice the food was amazing it tasted like real home made Italian food. They brought out are dishes fast too! Definitely recommend to come to this restaurant when coming to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception at Buddy V's and everyone left full and happy! The food and service was amazing. The staff was helpful. I did not have to worry about a thing. The lasagna was so tasty and satisfying, the croutons in the Caesar salad were a delicious surprise, and the cake we got from Carlo's bakery was so amazing and pretty. Thank you again Buddy V's!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant because I read a review of burgers and they said this was the best burger ever. Even if it was in an Italian restaurant. It took us forever to find the restaurant. It's not well signed. When we got there a nice lady took us to our table. We waited quite awhile to be noticed. Finally a snoody server came over. He tried to upsell us bottled water. We declined. Of course I didn't order the burger. Instead I had the smashed meatball sandwich. It came on a crisp french roll. It also had ricotta cheese on it. That just ruined it for me. The meatballs were dry and very little sauce. All I could taste was the ricotta. It came with french fries that were nothing spectacular. My friend had the vodka rigatoni. He said it was very good. It should have been for $23.00!! That was the lunch price. I think this place is over priced and to snoody for me. I would have much rather gone across the street to Mangiano's. I never have a bad meal there. No, I won't be back and won't recommend it."}
{"text":"We've been here for dinner and Sunday brunch...we always forget the exact location of this place is: 2nd floor, walk towards Las Vegas Blvd side. The food here is ok and service is great. If the Carlos Bakery line across from here is crazy, you might as well eat here and order bakery items for dessert.

I like how they have \"healthier' options here. The portions are perfect - which means, if you're starving or have hug appetite, you'll be hungry if you eat just 1 entree.

***DINNER***

Roasted Sea Bass:
Branzino with cured lemon, arugula salad and pine nuts.This was just ok. 3/5

Italian Greens:
Tuscan kale, plum tomatoes in garlic oil. Tasty but a little too oily. 2/5

Caramelized Sea Scallops:
Perfectly seared scallops with crispy prosciutto, parmesan polenta in tomato vinaigrette. 3.5/5

Seared Salmon:
Crisp salmon with charred broccolini, pickled vegetables in balsamic reduction. 4/5



***BUFFET BRUNCH***
Muffins, croissants, pan au chocolat, bacon, ham, sausage, scrambled eggs, French toast, crepes, nutella, jams/preserves, mascarpone, chicken parmesan, meatballs, orochiette with sausage, mac n cheese, salad, veggie frittata, garlic bread, tiramisu, cannoli, bread pudding, zeppole, red velvet cake, cookies, etc.

It's a pretty good spread. Definitely get the French toast, meatballs, mac n cheese and veggie frittata. I drizzled Nutella on my French toast....mmmmm...however, I don't think I got my $35 worth."}
{"text":"During lunch they have a buffet. It's not spectacular by any means. I was expecting more from the dessert section. The rest of the food was early average. I enjoyed the live music though."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian restaurant with a great view! Huge serving sizes, definitely think about sharing. Reasonably priced for what you get. I ordered the spaghetti with pomodoro sauce and started with a caprese salad, both really great. Highly recommend the lasagna and the chicken Parmesan. Really you can't go wrong with anything on the menu! I think it's even better food than Lavo Italian. 

Our server was beyond awesome! Good service in Vegas is really hard to come by."}
{"text":"After wanting to try this restaurant, we finally had lunch there recently. So glad we did!!
Our party of four started with calamari fritte and cheesy garlic bread. So good!! The most tender calamari we had ever had!! The bread was hot and cheesy with the perfect blend of herbs and garlic. 
The smashed meatball sandwich with Tuscan fries were delicious!! The most tender flavorful meatballs I've ever had!! The applewood bacon turkey club was also delicious!! Perfect amount of everything with good balance of flavors. The Caesar salad served with the turkey club was just okay. The dressing was mediocre. Overall, great experience!! We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. They do simple Italian dishes really well! Their octopus appetizer is full of flavor and cooked to perfection and their egg plant parm is some of the best I've had! Only downside is that they served their wine in cheap small wine glasses which really took away from the experience and did not highlight their well thought out wine list. Just remember to ask for a better glass if you get stuck with one! No other complaints, just a jersey girl proud of a Jersey chef!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing I was kind of surprised! Expensive but everything in Vegas is... best calamari ever so perfect! Tiramisu and eggplant were delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Revision -  oops, Buddy V not Bobby V!  

My sister's nephew said they serve great burgers here for lunch.  So we came for lunch and three of the five of us had the burger.

Angus beef burger served on a brioche bun.  Cooked to order.  Good but I'm not sure I'd come back just for a burger.

Attentive service at lunch.

You can access the restaurant which faces the Strip.  You don't even have to step into the casino.

Directly across the restaurant is the Cake Boss shop."}
{"text":"The food was really good. It's restaurant week so they had a special. We all got chicken parm with Caesar salad and cheesecake or cannoli for $20.18.  We thought this was a great value. The bread they bring out is delicious and melts in your mouth. The Caesar salad had the most amazing, what we initially thought were croutons, melt in your mouth cornbread-ish squares. The main entrees were plated beautiful and tasted delicious!  Our daughter got chicken parm off the kids menu and it was the same serving size but no dessert or salad for $12.  We got a sangria carafe for $24 and it was very good and it had a lot of fruit...but not so much alcohol which was ok with me. Service was super friendly, but a little slow.  All in all we were so glad that we stopped in."}
{"text":"I came back for the croutons...wait, what? You read that right. Croutons. The little, dried-up bread scraps on salads. I ordered a Caesar salad to start with before my entree, completely unaware of the discovery I was about to make. When my salad arrived, I was immediately intrigued by the croutons - they were unlike any I had ever seen. These croutons were perfect, one-inch square cubes, caramelized to a perfect golden brown on the outside. Biting into one, I discovered a filling of warm polenta - also known as grits in some parts. It was apparent that these croutons had just come out of the oven, and they were HEAVENLY! I wished I could  have ordered a whole plate of them - they were that good. The rest of my experience at Buddy V's was outstanding - the main course, the service, the ambience were all great. It was those croutons, however, that brought me back for dinner the next two nights in a row.

UPDATE: I stopped in for lunch on a Thursday with the family. They had a three-course lunch special. I started off with a Caesar Salad with those heavenly polenta croutons...WOW. My main course was the Chicken Parm, which was delicious. An order of Tiramisu and a cup of coffee was the perfect finish. The service and atmosphere were impeccable. I may have discovered one of the world's best Italian restaurants. I will not miss an opportunity to return!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first about trying a place based on a TV personality. But I am so happy I did. They have a brunch on the weekends until I want to say 230 and it looked amazing with a large variety. I did not try it due to arriving at the end of the time frame but I would go back just for that. I had the meatball sandwich and a cedar salad. The cedar salad had polenta croutons with like a lemon flavor. I love love love polenta so this was everything. I'd even go back just for this salad and it was a very large portion. Also tried the chicken parmigiana and the creamy pasta carbonara. All good. The theme is also very cute with checkered table clothes and very good service. There is also a view of the strip from the windows that I enjoyed. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5, I would. The food was really good! We wanted to dine at the restaurant on my birthday, but they were closed for a private party. So they asked us to make a reservation for the next night and they would take good care of us.  Not so true! We had to wait for a table and the service was bad. The guys in the red tshirts were better than the waiters. As for a bday dessert or a bday wish from the waiter- NOTHING!! Did not make me feel special at all, and to think I was soooo excited to celebrate my birthday there a day late. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Really surprised how good it was.  Ordered the linguine with shrimp and clams. Wasn't on the menu, but added the clams for a small up charge.  Server was really nice as well. Will be back."}
{"text":"The food was great and the friendly service even better. Thanks to Caleb, Rasberry, Adam, and chef Bryan Forgione for making our dinner for six a fantastic memory."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on 1/30/2017 which means Vegas was packed for the New Year festivities. I went to dinner with 11 of my friends who I was visiting Vegas with. The first thing I noticed about this restaurant was that it has a very cozy feel. Great place for family or a romantic night out with your significant other. We had a large group so we were seated toward the back of the restaurant. No complaints there because there was a huge window by our table that overlooked the strip. Our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She took the time to help us order... all 12 of us which I thought was great. For the appetizer, they offer a very flavorful bread with baked on cheese. So not really a cheesy bread. The bread was soft and came with a balsamic and olive oil mix. It was so delicious. For the main course, all of the meal come in very large portions. The menu offerings are also kind of pricey. I simply ordered their meatball appetizer because I wasn't very hungry that night of our trip. The meatballs were delicious. The dish came with about 6 meatballs for about $9. I also sampled my friends' meals and everything everyone ordered was delicious. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant if you want a nice, authentic Italian meal. My only regret is not have a big appetite the night I visited this restaurant so that I could have tried a full size meal. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"YUMM!!! I can't say enough about how delicious this place is! I wanted a second stomach so I could eat more. The tomato basil soup is AMAZING, the garlic cheese bread is sooooo good. I went with a group of 6 people and everything was incredibly delicious. Seriously come here hungry. We all ordered different things so we could try different items and they were all so yummy. Then of course went across and ordered some desserts ;)"}
{"text":"Day two of the restaurant being open so all the staff were on their toes.  Tried the Buddy's Salumi & Cheese Board (olives, pickled vegetables, grilled Italian bread, genoa salami, spicy capicola, proscuitto di parma, grana padano, tuscan pecorino, and gorgonzola).  The capicola and proscuitto were the best I've ever had and the gorgonzola was epic - bleu cheese flavor with the texture of brie.  Cheeseburger at an Italian restaurant?  You bet because the Pat Lafrieda Burger (brioche bun, tomato aioli, provolone cheese, tuscan fries) was really tasty.  The tiramisu was the best I've had anywhere.

Ask for a table bordering the outside perimeter windows for great views of The Strip.  Bring your camera to take pictures of the incredible entree cakes Buddy and his team made."}
{"text":"I give this place a two star because of the following 


1- this message is to the manager: there are ridiculously less amount of staff working in the restaurant,  i was waiting forever to get the check and i had to literally ask for everything. My water was not getting refilled and easily 30 min of our time got wasted for lack of management.

If you want customers to come back hire more staff and be professional, you also impact the poor staff by getting less tip and more work load.

When someone comes to your restaurant expects great experience


2- the food was good but there was so much fat in the chicken... 


The reason i give it a two star is because of friendly staff. I wont go back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"What a fun place to dine. We went for lunch. The service was amazing and fast. All employees were very nice. We ate off the lunch express menu which was more than enough. Sangria was delicious. Bloody Mary was good but a bit on spicy side. Would highly recommend this restaurant especially if looking for a place Away from casino. Loved it! Don't forget to go across the hall to Carlos bakery. Get there as soon as they open!"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding! Our 8 year old girls were cold and the Venetian sets the thermostat so there is nothing they can do about it. The manager brought over two tablecloths for them to wrap up in!

The Sunday Gravy is very good. The cheese board is a bit average. The Italian fish was liked and so were the meatballs.

The lower rating is due to the dessert menu. It is limited and not very good. We ordered the apple turnover, tiramisu, cannollis, ice cream, lemon blueberry cheesecake and the hazelnut chocolate cake. The ice cream is great, but not home made and the only other great dessert was the hazelnut chocolate cake. Everything else was very average. What a surprise!

You have to walk by their bakery across the hall and you see the pastry chefs make these amazing looking desserts through a glass window, but none of them are on the menu! I expected fabulous dessert, but it was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Best meal in Las Vegas in recent memory. Great service - thank you, Georgio.
Amazing lasagna and linguini with clams. The croutons in the Caesars salad were warm and made of polenta. And the desert! the cannoli is what dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Very good place! Some of the best gravy you will find outside grandmas kitchen. You can bank on that.

Also the best Mac n Cheese I've ever had. If only it had Lobster as an option! 

The meatballs are excellent. The Lasagana was excellent. The Caprese was excellent. The calamari was very good.

We will definitely be back.

Oh and the bartender was super hot. We didn't catch her name but we both appreciated her mucho."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was fabulous! The macaroni and cheese and meatballs were great! I personally didn't care for the cannoli, but the brownies were to die for and the cookies were delicious. The food choices were adequate, but I was surprised that there wasn't any spaghetti. Definitely not disappointed!  Great place to dine."}
{"text":"The servers were extremely attentive. The decor was nice and the prices were moderate for a meal at a high end location.   The Mac and cheese appetizer was to die for."}
{"text":"This review is for Sunday brunch. It starts at 10:30 in the morning. It goes until early afternoon.
The price is around $35 per person, unless you include bottomless Mimosas or sangrias or Bellinis for an added $15 or bloody Mary's for an added $17 with the souvenir cup. We chose not to do that.
There are a few stations around the restaurant. To begin with, there is a children's station with candy, pizza, fruit, and raw sliced vegetables. There is a meat section with apple sausage, thick bacon, and other choices. There is a soup and salad/antipasto section. There is a warm food section which has scrambled eggs, Sunday Alex, French toast, crepes with options for feelings, a penne carbonara dish, a tagliatelle dish, traditional Italian meatballs, and several other yummy choices. Finally there is a desert section.
The tagliatelle and penne dishes were disappointing and very average. Other than that, everything was delicious. The breakfast is very good. The dessert table is pretty good and the best part is the bread pudding. The tiramisu was a let down for me which is surprising but I have had way better.
The service is very good. The restaurant is nice. We did have to ask for a different table as we found out our table was way too close to the next table and it was hard to get out to get to the food stations.
For the price, this place is reasonable. Other places are way more expensive. It is not a five star brunch, but it's a solid four star. 
This is a good place for families and it is a great place for kids."}
{"text":"I had a awesome time at this restaurant 
I really loved the food , great taste , great drinks .
Beautiful interior design and really friendly staff.
I really recomend it"}
{"text":"Had tomato basil soup, chicken Parmesan and cake. Everything was ok but comparable to Buca de Peppo or Eastside Marios. Actually the later two I would consider going to before buddy vs. I love his Sunday gravy recipe so I thought this would be an excellent place. Spaghetti was a little underdone. Server was nice. Beer selection was ok. Probably wouldn't recommend or go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic! First time here and it was for a friend's birthday. We had an amazing view overlooking the strip. First, the decor was super fun with bundt cake pans decorating the walls, rolling pin room dividers and light fixtures that looked like giant whisks. Like entertainment too. Although we couldn't see him, his piano and voice could be heard throughout. And a nice variety of music too! Everything from Frank Sinatra to Maroon 5. Now for the food... For appetizers we got some amazing Jersey mozzarella dish as well as a grilled cheese garlic bread. Both were amazing but now looking back perhaps we shouldn't have ordered two cheese appetizers. Cue in the awkward silence... Just kidding! No such thing as too much cheese! For entrees I highly recommend the lasagna, Sunday gravy and orecchiette with Italian sausage and broccoli I. For desert we had some amazing lemon raspberry cheesecake and the Italian birthday cake. Both were excellent! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"fantastic service, there were waiters walking by us and checking on us constantly. they did well to not interrupt us but quietly fill water and bus empty plates. my mom and i shared a caesar salad and a calamari appetizer and it was almost too much for us! their bread and croutons are unexpectedly yummy."}
{"text":"We came for dessert after drooling over Buddy V's cakes. I haven't had this terrible of desserts since...I don't know. They served frozen desserts from some chain supplier like Cisco. Had cannoli, Italian wedding cake, and three scoops gelato of different flavors. Cannoli was in a greasy shell that tasted like Mexican fried ice cream shell and cheese was more like whipped cream, not even mascarpone. Wedding cake was cold and also similar cheap greasy flavor. Gelato had not enough flavor for \"gelato\". Top that off with Vegas pricing and slowest service in Vegas, plus people smoking freely where we were sitting, so will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. You feel like home when you eat here. The plates are huge and filling. Our servers were amazing and super nice. The food tastes homemade and treated us like we were important. The lasagna is huge so if you're not that full, they can split it and it's still a big portion."}
{"text":"Seriously really delicious food. Must orders:
Calamari - one of the best we've ever had
Lasagna- the best we've ever had
Meatballs- better than mine and the best we've ever had

We also had 
Parmesan chicken- moist and yummy probably the best one we've had as it has a tendency to be dry but this one wasn't.

Linguine and clams- very good
Cheese pizza - kids liked it

I will definitely come back!!

Tried the bakery earlier and discovered this gem.  

Don't forget to ask for Rosemary fresh bread and dip into oil with Parmesan...."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here for dinner based on all the reviews but once I left, I wondered why it was so loved. It wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't amazing. 
I called in a week ahead and made reservations for a Friday night. They were accommodating and I called the night before to confirm the reservation. The place isn't hard to find, but it can be better described..I was told it was across Barney's, but there are many levels and entrances. Anyhow, we were seated promptly, but without menus. The waitress came by a few min later and described that they do family style or menu if we prefer. We preferred the menu. Since we were pretty hungry, I ordered 2 fries for our table and we all ordered our food- some of us to share the meals. 
The fries came, and they were mediocre. Then someone came by with warm bread for the table- I wish they did this sooner so we knew. Or even mentioned it. Anyhow, food arrived and it was fine. I shared the chicken parm and it was decent. No one complained about the food, but no one raved about it either. 
It did take some time for the check and then for them to come back to collect it. 
Would I go here again? Maybe but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian experience I have had and their lasagna was phenomenal! Great service and decor."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch wanting to try Buddy V's chicken blt since it looked pretty good in pictures and seemed to have pretty positive reviews.  Honestly, while it wasn't terrible or anything, it wasn't as great as it looked or as tasty as I thought it would be.  To top it off, service was \"meh\" and my reservation requests were totally ignored.  I requested a booth by a window but did not get that.  (It was busy for lunch though and almost every table was occupied.)  I also noted that we were celebrating a birthday but not even a simple birthday greeting was given.  Totally disappointing.  I wasn't crazy either about how close the tables were to each other.  One good thing at least was that our water glasses never went empty?  Also, the Caesar salad that came with my sandwich had warm, soft croutons which added a different but interesting taste to it.  Glad I could check this place off my \"to try\" list, but after that experience there really wasn't anything to make me want to come back here again."}
{"text":"This place is so incredibly good buddy has done in amazing job making sure that this food is a real Italian food the meat balls are and spaghetti are a must. Staff is super bz but they still do a good job."}
{"text":"Buddy V's Ristorante is located within The Venetian hotel. My best friends parents treated us out to lunch here on a Saturday. It wasn't too crowded and I wasn't sure what to expect. We were seated promptly given we had a reservation for 10. After looking at the menu a few of us decided to get a few different items and eat family style. 

// FOOD //
Margherita Pizza: sliced tomatoes, basil, fresh mozzarella. Simple and light. It's a medium sized crust, not crispy or too doughy. I really enjoyed this one with a little grated parmesan and crushed red pepper. 4.5/5

Buddy's Favorite Pizza:  spiced sausage, caramelized onions, fennel, four cheese. I didn't care for this one too much. The sausage and the blend of cheese didn't go well together. I would definitely go with the margherita pizza instead. 2.5/5

Spaghetti Central with Meatballs: Your basic and simple spaghetti with five meatballs. It was simple, but I thoroughly enjoyed the tomato sauce. I thought it had excellent flavor. I would definitely order this again and maybe try it with the bolognese next time. 4/5

Chicken Parm: Provolone, mozzarella, spaghetti marinara. This dish was excellent for sharing. It would have been too heavy if one person just got it, but it was great for our group. They give two chicken breasts with a decent portion of spaghetti on the side. The chicken parm was deliciously cheesy! 4/5

Overall, I was extremely pleased with the service and food at Buddy V's Ristorante. I will definitely be back for more of that tomato sauce goodness. The only thing that can possibly make this place any better is if they served you some fresh break with oil and balsamic in the beginning. Just saying... 

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews. Stayed for the fantastic service and food. I've traveled far and wide in the world and I have to rank this high on my list of great dining experiences.  My thanks to Chris and Tawny for making me feel right at home. 
And to the kitchen for an incredible meal of bone in veal chop!  Absolutely outstanding. Great job Bobby V.  on your hiring and training!!!"}
{"text":"This is a place I have been wanting to try since we moved to Vegas. I think I blew it by going to Bootleggers before coming here. I love Cake Boss's show so I had high hopes for his restaurant. We went at about 345pm on a Thursday afternoon. We were sat right away at a great window table that over looked the strip. It is always nice to feel like we are tourists here even though we have been here almost 3 years now.  We decided to get things we could share...so of course I had to order the garlic cheese bread and Mac.n.cheese to start. Both delicious. The garlic cheese bread was served with amazing marinara sauce. The mac.n.cheese was creamy had pancetta and peas with a crumb top on it. Delicious. Made the way mac.n.cheese should be...creamy goodness. For our main dish we ordered Buddy's favorite pizza and Bolognese. The pizza was yummy, sausage, grilled onions, fennel and 4 different types of cheeses. The crust of the pizza was cooked to perfection, a little crispness, but still soft and very tasty. The sausage was perfect with all the onions and cheese.  The only item I was not impressed with was the Bolognese...lack of flavor, creaminess, and the spaghetti noodles...we're just store bought...I guess since he is a baker...I expected homemade noodles...so I was a little disappointed...and the Bolognese I had at Bootleggers blows this out of the water. It was also $23 for a bowl the wasn't even big enough to feed my man. Had we only ordered this we would have left hungry....and we probably would not ever go back. But luckily we ordered other good dishes...so if we happen to be at the Venetian again and are craving italian...we would go again. I only gave them a 3 because I was disappointed...but I think I just set my bar too high!"}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious!  Our waiter Peter J was exceptional!  Everything he recommended was fantastic.  From the cocktails to the entrees!  I will definitely come back again the next time we are in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Against my better judgement I went to eat here because I assumed that even if the food was mediocre at least the dessert menu should be stellar. Not the case. Two thin,appetizer sized pieces veal and some third rate lasagna for almost $60 in a space that only poor people wont mind dining in. I thought the dessert menu would make up for this but boy was I wrong. About 6 underwhelming options from the \"Cake Boss\". WTF? I ordered two items that were as pathetic as the food. Steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"Happiest Happy Hour

Happy Hour 4:30- 6:30 pm 7 days a week..$5 small bites & Select alcoholic beverages are $4 (Wine, Sangria, Prosecco, Domestic Beers, & Bloody Mary's/Ceasars)

I ordered the sangria...not the best, I wouldn't order it again...But My friend ordered Prosecco and it was a full glass...

We ordered fried calamari (It Was Good), Gnocchi  (Good), & Mac & Cheese Carbonara  (GREAT...smoked mozzarella & fontina set it off)...

Definitely a great choice!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I was with the chef Bryan Forgione for a Guns N Roses concert at T-mobile arena.  Private box.  He is a cool guy and knows how to cook!"}
{"text":"5 stars for service. Team work, communication, a sense of urgency, and very polite. Our food was SALTY (chicken piccata and pasta with vodka sauce)!!!!! 
My boyfriend and I have worked in hospitality for years and understand that mishaps.....happen. We don't rush to complain but the food was not made for consumption. HOWEVER, the service and quick replacement of meals made all the difference. Server and manager were fantastic in having us leave there very satisfied. I ended up getting a new chicken piccata with less salty sauce on the side and my boyfriend opted for lasagna which was awesome (light and airy and full of flavor).
Octopus appetizer was very good and not too salty! 
We shall be back Buddy!
By the way, great team you have."}
{"text":"Way overrated. I think these reviews are based on the happy hour. Just ate there. Food was just ok. Portions aren't huge like people are saying here. SERVICE was horrendous. Waited for ever for a waitress. It was our anniversary even said happy anniversary but didn't even offer a free cannoli. We didn't even want it but she didn't even offer. Her and the water bus boy were too busy cavorting.  The FOOD was just so so. I would never return"}
{"text":"So far this place sucks. Arrogant hostess that just keeps saying we are working on your table. This was going to be a nice company dinner for 6 people. Reservation was made 2 months ago and it is now 30 minutes past our reservation time. Rude hostess and at least 30 minute wait for our table so far.
Not a good start.
In the end the food was good and the server was great. The manager came out and talked to us.
All in all once we got seated it was a nice, pleasant dinner with good food and very good service."}
{"text":"Amazing food great service not a long wait for a table, just keep in mind you get what you pay for in saying that the food is worth the price."}
{"text":"Great Italian food, will definitely come back here again.
5/5 Shrimp on a chopped vegetable salad. Better for the healthy conscious.
Shrimp was cooked perfectly, tender in a butter garlic. $23
4/5 Veal Marsala. Thinly sliced veal in a dark thick wine mushroom sauce. A bit too salty or concentrated. Really good buttery garlic pasta with light cheese topping. I wish I had double pasta.
$26
4/5 Trying to decide Lobster tail desert or chocolate Nutella cake? Lobster tail won, very light, flaky crust with cannoli cream and fresh fruit. Some of the crust was non uniform in crunch but very good. $9/each.
5/5 Unsweetened ice tea. The best tea taste in Vegas so far. Surprising to me so I had to rate it.
Overall with tip and tax $97 for two."}
{"text":"We weren't quite as impressed as a year ago. First, with a reservation, we were seated in the bar area. It was loud, noisy and the a/c was blowing directly on us. The hostess said nothing else was available. We spotted a booth that just opened up lower down and requested the change of table from the server. Great service in the booth that we were moved to. I ordered from their special menu that was all inclusive. I chose the chicken Parmesan. It was tasty but the sauce was a bit more bland than I prefer. I have to say the cannoli and tiramisu were out of this world. I enjoyed the tomato basil soup as well. This experience was ruined by the hostess seating a reservation at a bar table."}
{"text":"After losing a small fortune in a matter of minutes I didn't think I could be so happy so quickly. Buddy V's was literally on of the best restaurant I have been to in Vegas. To start the lobster tail (dessert) could make a grown man cry of joy, I literally would have been happy to stick a straw in it and suck out all the cream out instead of actually ordering a meal (Which is what I did the following day, pretty sure i gained about 10lbs just off of lobster tail filling)

Enough about the dessert (I'll be talking more about it more when I write my Carlos Bakery review, yes it was that good!) The entrees are not something to overlook either. Let me start out by saying I am a somewhat food snob when it comes to classier restaurant. While I have left some places questioning the quality based on what I paid this is certainly not one of those times. As far as Italian food goes it doesn't get much better, the quality is spectacular and there is nothing that I would have changed. To top it off the portions were HUGE! Being a guy in his early 20's of course I forced myself to eat every bite. However most people would have probably took half of it to go.

If you are ever in Las Vegas do yourself a favor and stop by Buddy V's for dinner."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to in a long time. Always been a fan of the cake boss and was excited to try his restaurant. The decor was nice, the tables can feel a little close together but that's not a big deal. The staff were great at helping me to decide what to order from the menu. Ended up trying the Aunt Nina's mozzarella en carozza, Buddy's dad's bucatini carbonara, and Nonna's lasagna al forno. 

Everything tasted amazing, and I was a big fan of the mozzarella en carozza and the lasagna. Definitely coming here again the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Peter our waiter was great. The chicken parm was excellent. Would definitely go here again. Portion was just right.  Meals came out quickly. Definitely make a reservation because they had long wait time if you didn't have one"}
{"text":"With relatively easy entrance from the Strip, competitive pricing to other Italian spots nearby and a nice dining area, it's clear to see why Buddy V's Ristorante has maintained a good level of success since they opened.  I had only previously been to happy hour here, which is one of the best values on the boulevard from 4:30pm-6:30pm daily by the way, and had my mind set on a couple of items prior to walking in.  

Skipping formalities, like ya know...salad, we started with \"Grandma's Meatballs\".  The six spheres mixed with beef, veal and pork were very good and perfectly portioned for the group.  I usually prefer them pan-fried first before being dropped into sauce, which these were not, but eaters gonna eat and they disappeared within minutes.  

And funny how things are always extra special and endearing once \"Grandma\" is added to the front of it. Grandma's apple pie.  Grandma's pet rat.  Grandma's criminal record.  

The \"Bone-In Parm Chop\" was screaming out to me and totally rocked my world.  With a  hefty quantity of crispy, juicy veal meat doused in a mouth-watering marinara sauce and then finished in the oven after being topped with ooey gooey mozzarella and provolone cheese, this dish was outstanding, well presented, and worth the $42.  Being such a large entree, I'd recommend two people going in on it together while getting a few more appetizers to make it a better rounded meal.  I personally felt rounder afterwards.  

A couple of other \"can't go wrong\" items I was able to sample were the ultra meaty \"Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno\" and \"Veal Marsala\" with its rich mushroom ragu.  No room for dessert this time, but I am confident that I can count on this spot for a solid \"pasto\" in the future."}
{"text":"It was mid day and needed a snack from all the walking we've just done. The bar was not too busy as it was 3pm in the afternoon. The bartender was extremely nice along with all the staff that came by to drop off items. 

We asked the bartender what he'd recommend and he stated it was the lasagna. By jolly gee was it fantastic. It came out scorching hot in a pan like skillet. Cheese melted and meatiness in every bite. We also had the Nutella cake with a scoop of ice cream if this wasn't a snack I'd say you can finish the lasagna on your own but it was a perfect share. 

The price was reasonable and the portions are right sized not too much or too little. If your craving Italian this is the spot."}
{"text":"Came for all day outside patio happy hour so you sit inside the hotel watching people wait in line to get there sugar rush on at Carlo's.  We ordered the calamari for my 3 year old and server forgot to tell me its fried with hot peppers so he couldn't eat it and this kid loves calamari!  On top of that both appetizer and pizza came out at once.  Obviously she forgot to ring in our calamari.  Rays loaded pizza was dry and hard bread, don't order it.  Bloody Mary's were delicious.  Server was nice but we were forgotten.  Prices for happy hour is worth it, $6 apps and $5 drinks.  I think the food is good but we ordered wrong."}
{"text":"We are Cake Boss fans, so we enjoyed this restaurant. We had a half hour wait on a Thursday night, not too bad. Good kids menu & a pretty good selection of Carlo's Bakery desserts.  Probably the best meal we had in Vegas."}
{"text":"The customer service is excellent. Our waiter was very attentive. The food is super good. The experience was so worth it."}
{"text":"The chicken parmesan is delicious. Beware their dinner plate is very large. They have friendly staff as well. A bit pricey."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!!! We came here for my sister-in-laws birthday dinner and with all the great reviews we thought it would be a great experience but boy was I wrong. We got seated pretty quickly without a reservation so it did start off good. We placed our drink order and thats when it all went wrong. We got our drinks but after that did not see our server for 20 min even after asking other workers for him and that we were ready to order. He finally came back and we placed our order. Our appetizers came first and after finishing they cleared the table completely taking all napkins and utensils. The food finally arrived to the table and we all were starving but couldn't start eating because we did not have any utensils to eat with. After asking for our waiter and waiting another 15 minutes and having our food get cold we finally got our waiter and he grabbed the utensils. Finally we told them it was my sister-in-laws birthday so they brought out a cake which was not that good and we sang to her. We then received the check and they charged us $10 for the cake we didn't even eat. Definitely will not be going again."}
{"text":"Excellent service, and food. Had a taste for spaghetti and meatballs - best I've ever had. Water glass never went below half, and I drink a lot...lol. Had a melon blossom drink, not a big drinker but that was very good as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Buddy V's for dinner! The wait on a Saturday night was a little long (45 min when we came at 8:30 pm), but we were able to get a seat by the window which we requested. 

We ordered the lasagna and grilled salmon. The lasagna is huge and big enough for 2 to share. The salmon lies on a bed of salad and was light and enjoyable. 

We also tried the specialty cocktail with the lemon sorbet and it was delicious! 

The view of the strip is a great addition to the food. Service was perfect. Would love to come back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Was just here in April 2017, and had the best time! Wait staff was timely and friendly. Knew what they were doing!  Our table of 4 had: MY MOTHER IN LAW'S
CAPELLINI SHRIMP SCAMPI - huge portion, even larger shrimp; NONNA'S LASAGNA AL FORNO - there's no such thing as too much cheese Wonderful!; BUDDY'S CAPRESE SALAD - so many heirloom tomatoes, it's almost a full meal; CAESAR SALAD - with croutons dripping with garlic butter; ORECCHIETTE
& ITALIAN SAUSAGE - large, large portion; GRILLED SALMON - wonderful, moist, flaky; and TIRAMISU for dessert - nice way to end any meal.

Enjoyed the visit - no, it wasn't cheap, but nothing is in Las Vegas, and you're paying for the ambiance and experience as well, and we weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"This was a great Sunday Brunch, my first time there. Flavorful items. They also have a regular menu, for those who prefer there meals served. Delicious Sangria! Kids will love what they offerhave a small appetite and it was enough! I recommend Buddy V's. I will return for the full menu!"}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times. Food is either always really good or just a little off -- like too salty -- but still decent. 
The desserts are always ridiculously good, creme brûlée and lobster tail are delicious, the desserts are definitely the best part of the meal. Customer service, not so good. Servers disappear or really rush around to where you only see them 10% of your entire visit when it should be more like 40%. Drinks go unrefilled and putting in orders or requests can take a while. 
Good food, a little pricey. Just wish the servers would slow down and be more attentative to their tables needs. Wouldn't normally say anything but been here 5 times and noticed this every time."}
{"text":"I honestly had a hard time finding things to eat here as a vegan. I opted for the whole wheat penne pasta with roasted vegetables - mostly mushrooms! It was delicious, aside from the mushrooms. I'd prefer if it was listed in the description what the veggies were! Otherwise, seems like an average Italian restaurant to me."}
{"text":"We had a very nice family dinner with my parents at Buddy V's restaurant. We shared the appetizers family style - Cesar salad with yummy polenta croutons, calamari fritti and scrumptioius Grandma's meatballs.  

We had the following entrees:
1) Linguine with clams
2) Mediterranean sea bass
3) Grilled salmon
4) Chicken Parm
5) Classic cheese pizza

For dessert, we had the butterscotch creme brulee with vanilla mascarpone cream, pecan nib shortbread and the apple pie with caramel cinnamon apples, oatmeal & raisin crubmle and vanilla ice cream. The dessert menu was in a mini photo album with shared memories of Buddy growing up and his family. Overall it was delicious authentic Italian food, fresh pasta and flavorful meatballs, chicken and seafood. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"First time here, had the orecchiette with Italian sausage which was delicious. A little bit on the pricey side, but very good food. Also nice that it's a few steps away from the grand canal so is a little bit less noisy."}
{"text":"The grilled octopus is probably the best I have ever had. My husband and I still talk about it. The drinks are great and the pasta is the real deal here. The service was excellent! This is another restaurant on our list of favorites in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Buddy V's Ristorante on May 10, 2014. I'm a fan of Cake Boss so I knew in advance of our trip that this would be one of the first places we would eat at. She ordered Nonna's Lasanga al Forno which we both enjoyed. I ordered the Valastro Sunday Gravy which also was pretty good. To be honest I expected a little more from the restaurant before arriving there, but at the same time it is what it's described as. A casual Italian restaurant with a famous owner and I'm ok with that."}
{"text":"Me and my Family had an early dinner in the restaurant this Sunday. We had a really bad experience as for your customer service. We arrived with a 1,5 year old toddler and my pregnant wife, they let us wait on the side - even we arrived before the peak time. We needed to ask for a highchair multiple times. Our server (Caleb H, if I can believe the name, what is on the check) was super pushy. He didn't event care about we are with a small child. No plastic cup was offered, not even straw for a child. As soon as we told him nicely we don't want any appetizer, he became even more pushy and extremely rude. 

We just wanted to have a nice dinner, and enjoy our first night in Las Vegas, in a special restaurant. Especially because it was the first experience for my mother in law from overseas - who loves Buddy btw, she even went to see his Hoboken cake shop! 

After we had our meal, Caleb never came to offer Parmesan cheese to our dish and hardy did any check back on us. It was super obvious, that we received \"different\" service, comparing to the table next to us. We felt really unwelcome. 

The food was really delicious and the busser/or server assistant was super nice and caring. He took care of us better, than our server. Unfortunately we don't know his name. He was the only reason we left tip for the server. We hope at least the server treated him better that night, than the paying costumers. 

The restaurant was really busy, so we had no chance to speak to a manager. So we couldn't leave any feedback personally."}
{"text":"I will let you know up front I usually do not like celebrity restaurants because they are overhyped and don't seem to deliver value for the price.  There are a few exceptions to this rule and Buddy V's is one of them for the following reasons.

1) As celebrity restaurants go, Buddy V's doesn't try to be trendy, rather it sticks to rustic italian fare and is very successful at it.
2) Pricing is actually more on the reasonable side than ultra expensive.  For $38.00 you can get a fixed price meal of an appetizer, entree and desert.  I had the Grandma's meatballs which were incredible, light fluffy balls of flavor in a red sauce; a pasta dish consisting of Bucatini, a thin tube spaghetti with pancetta black pepper and egg(this was my favorite dish of the night and is worth going back for more), and closed the night with nutella cake which was delicious.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals.
3) The service is fantastic. The waiter was very knowledgeable, guiding us with knowledge of all the dishes on the menu and providing prompt drink service and bread service. 

All in all a great experience for the simple Italian cooking."}
{"text":"Agree with the reviews, we really enjoyed dinner here. The caprese salad is out of this world delicious! I ordered the bucatini carbonara and my husband got the spaghetti bolognese. Both were tasty. We ended the meal with a tiramisu. I loved the casual atmosphere of this place. Would recommend for a nice casual meal."}
{"text":"Delicious meatballs!  The garlic cheese bread and delicious home made marinara sauce are the bomb.
The bar seats have a nice view of the strip."}
{"text":"Expected a tourist trap and average food. Instead received unblemished service, dynamite meatball appetizer, delicious chicken parm and great desserts. Never know until you try something, and Buddy V's won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Nutella Warm Cake was Life changing! We finished that in less than a minute. All four stars are for that. The atmosphere was charming, I love open kitchens. My fiancé loved the Chicken parm, she said it was the best she ever had, and she gets it everywhere we go, so that says something. Our waiter was being super thirsty and was giving all the attention to the people next to us who he was hitting on ferociously, I was kinda jealous, he didn't even ask us one question except, if we want dessert. The bus boy though he was on turbo mode, my glass was never empty, we always had bread and he was on it. So all and all that balanced it out."}
{"text":"We came here for the brunch. The quality of food was top notch. I am not a big cheese person but I enjoyed the cheese here. The olives were something else!!!
Overall great place to eat."}
{"text":"I came here for a Sunday brunch and holy cow this place was amazing! They serve shrimp cocktail early in the morning at 10:30AM (YES!)

First of all, the hostess and waitresses are very kind and attentitive. They were also informative as well since they knew it was our first time here at Buddy V's. I ordered bottomless mimosas, but you could also change your drinks to a sangria or a Bellini! I thought that deal was one I had to take! Their food was delicious! I loved their tomato soup and the ham that they served. I also loved the scrambled eggs and the mini crepes they had. Their \"Grandma meatballs\" were also very flavorful and satisfying  I've been to the brunch buffet in Paris but I've got to say this Sunday brunch buffet tops Paris! 

I can definitely see myself coming back here again, my only complaint would be that the area is too cold. I think if they raised their tempurature it would have been more comfortable for me but everyone in my party was so cold, which was the only reason why we wanted to get out of there."}
{"text":"When I was booking the Palazzo as the hotel for NYE 2016 I noticed they offered a $25 dining credit for Buddy V's. As I was choosing from several options the Buddy V's credit sealed the deal as I can always fall back on this restaurant to serve delicious \"homemade\" comfort Italian food. With this I convinced my family to dine here for dinner.

Dinner is a different beast from lunch. With lunch the No1DP and I are able to have a pretty quiet meal with plenty of natural sunlight. There's also not much activity going on in the middle of the day. Come dinner, especially on the day before NYE, the place was swamped and the tables were loud. There were also plenty of people in line to get a table or in line for the nearby Carlo bakery.

The 3-course pre-theater menu ($38/person) was a hit with everyone in my family. It made ordering a lot easier and since I was covering the dinner tab, along with the $25 credit made a Vegas dinner more reasonably-priced (but still expensive for regular casual Italian). What made it particularly appealing for me was that the menu options included my favorites: Grandma's Meatballs, My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara and Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake. These were the standout dishes I stated in previous reviews and I was very happy I could have all my favorites in one sitting. This was a lot of food - I remember eating cold bucatini carbonara the next day for breakfast (which BTW is still very good if you don't mind eating it cold).

In summary I've enjoyed both lunch and dinner at Buddy V's though the situations that I'll recommend both are different. I'll recommend doing small plates for lunch as the portion sizes are more manageable if you want to save your appetite for a big and fancy dinner. This is currently the arrangement for the No1DP and I whenever we're in Vegas. I'll recommend dinner as a non-date or casual date option if all a party wants is just some good comfort Italian food.

LUNCH: 4/5.
DINNER: 4.5/5."}
{"text":"Expected way more then what was received.the restaurants decor itself needed help. Very plain Jane nothing special. Looked like a country restaurant serving Italian food. Food itself was bland and plain. Services was just down right disgusting. The waitress and hostess are judgment and rude. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. Had dinner there with the family while in Vegas. Everyone was very happy with their dishes and drinks. Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived about 5 pm Wednesday to take advantage of happy hour pricing which runs 4:30-6:30. Small plate specials were $5.00 each, side salad for $7.00. About 8 choices total. Items we ordered were very good. Originally met by an unfriendly Hostess (I assume she's tired of answering \"where do I sit for HH?\") but our server was very nice, attentive and busy. Would like to revisit if in the area and order off menu but it is pricey."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable dinner at Buddy V's in the Palazzo Hotel. the prices were very reasonable, the service was good, and the food was delicious.

I had the chicken parmigiana and really enjoyed it. It was a very large portion with two large cutlets. The chicken was so tender, I didn't even need a knife, as I could cut it with a fork.

My wife had linguini with claims, and she also enjoyed her dinner. There were plenty of claims with the pasta.

We will definitely return during our next visit in Vegas."}
{"text":"Sorry...not a fan. We opted to do Sunday brunch and the food was just not good. The hot offerings had 2 types of eggs, chicken parm, frittata, and pastas. It was cold and gummy. Mac and cheese was saturated with oil. Carving station had your choice of apple sausage, Italian sausage, and Ham. They were so stingy with the meats only giving you one piece of meat. Nothing special about that. Peel and eat shrimp was good and the panzanella salad. The salad was very light and refreshing. Desserts pretty to look at but sadly, disappointing, even the famed cannolli's not enjoyable. Waitress was too busy flirting with guys instead of serving us. Not acceptable nor enjoyable for brunch."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and all really enjoyed it.  Our waiter was great and helped guide us through the menu. We started out with appetizers of the meatballs, calamari, and the antipasto board. Everything was very good. We didn't leave a bite. For lunch we had the family style serving. We had lasagna, salmon, chicken parmigiana, and vodka pasta. The salmon was very good along with the lasagna. The chicken parmigiana was also very good. Chicken was fried smothered in cheese. Even though everyone was satisfied with the meal our waiter talked us into dessert. We had a tray of canolli's, molten chocolate cake, gelato, and other desserts. Great lunch experience."}
{"text":"That lasagna is amazing and enough for 3 people.  I ate a third of it and could not eat anymore.  The flavors were great and the portion size was even better.  I also had the shrimp pasta dish that was a party in my mouth.  The service was excellent and the location in a great hotel.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here for our anniversary, we asked for the Express Lunch menu (you have to ask) which includes an app, entree and dessert for $22/ person, Out waiter, Danny was very pleasant and took note from my opentable reservation that it was our anniversary and gave us a free cannoli on the House. We will be back on our next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"Short wait for lunch. Service was good and the drinks are strong. The salmon was excellent and had a balsamic reduction which gave it a nice sweet crust. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and food was bland.

They couldn't even make a chicken btl correctly, they \"forgot\" the slice of bread .  No apology fr the manger or chef.

I don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!  The food was amazing! We had the whole wheat penne and the orecchiette with Italian sausage. Really good. We also split the Nutella cake with salted Carmel ice creme. One of the best deserts I have had."}
{"text":"Buddy V's is actually quite an interesting place to dine. This joint is not one of the high end Italian joints that you're used to seeing in Vegas, it's more of a casual dining experience in which you can wear shorts and a t shirt and fit right in. The ambiance is actually pretty nice and the location has some decent views of the strip. The food taste was just average, IMHO... Essentially nothing to write home about, the lasagna was just ok and rather small in portion while the Caesar salad was below average but did have croutons that were awesome (warm and soft). Overall, this may be a good spot to go the next day after a long night out, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.

{"text":"Great family style Italian restaurant and bakery.  Food, service, drinks, ambiance and prices are all great.  Loved the pasta, octopus, meatballs, sausages,  appetizers, kale side dish, fish and bread.  Desserts are to die for and awesome coffee and espresso drinks.  Speaking of drinks the bar menu is fantastic and the wine list is right behind it.  I don't go down to the Strip much for Italian, but, when I do, I go to Buddy V's."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the meatballs for appetizers, and the bread was some of the best we've had. The lasagna was so filling, I had quite a bit for leftovers. This is one of the best Italian restaurants I've tried recently, and I highly recommend it. The customer service was excellent, and we look forward to going again."}
{"text":"I can see I'm one of many who loved this restaurant!  We arrived about 9 PM on a Thursday night.  The place was packed but fortunately there were two seats at the bar, which we prefer.  Christia was awesome.  She made me a great martini and then proceeded to help us order.  We had meatballs and a caesar salad to start.  Both yum.  The croutons are made from polenta which was a nice surprise.  We ordered Sea Bass and Chicken Parm for entrees.  Once again, yum! Nutella cake for dessert.  After stuffing ourselves silly we walked around the beautiful Venetian Hotel and Grand Canal."}
{"text":"I make sure to come here whenever I am in Vegas. Not really that expensive given it is in a strip casino. I really enjoy their chicken parm."}
{"text":"I wanted to start out by saying Buddy V's Ristorante was highly recommended to me by my son from the night before on Mother's Day. My boyfriend suggested we dine there for my birthday the next night. Being raised in an old fashion Italian family that cooked a lot, I usually do not like to eat out at Italian restaurants because the food usually taste too Americanize and falls short of true Italian cuisine.  Well, I must say I give Buddy V's a big 5 stars. Their food, Charred Octopus, Orecchiette & Italian Sausage (pasta), Roasted Branzio (seasonal fish), Italian Greens (Tuscan kale, garlic oil, plum tomatoes) was the best ever!! My whole crazy Italian family would approve! Be warned the tropical drinks are very delicious but very strong. I got cockeyed 1/4 of the way drinking from my glass. I ended the evening with a cannoli which I give a 4 star because I still think my Mom's cannoli were a bit better. I was a little disappointed they did not offer a SMALL comp birthday dessert however they did write happy birthday on my Cannoli plate with chocolate. Coffee was great tasting and the serves rocks! Everyone is friendly and attentive.  I love this place, I may have to come back for brunch!"}
{"text":"let me first state the food was good to very good, the service was lame. our server \"Kristi F.\" left us waiting to the point we had to ask a person who cleared tables to have her come by and take our order. She rarely came by never checked on us. We had ordered several fixed menu items, that included desert, yet after the table was cleared from the dinner course she spread out desert menus saying, this and that were good.. We told her we had ordered the fixed menu that was inclusive of such and it seemed rather a  surprise to her, as she collected those desert menus Luckily the two young girls with us were entertained during the obscenely long 2.5 hour meal fest. I am not impressed.

Do not misunderstand me the food was good, the service was quite poor. I did not see a manager walking around, critiquing the troops on their performance and yet obviously it was needed.

The restaurant did NOT appear full, several tables were unoccupied. This adds to my confusion of tonight's performance. Perhaps we caught a bad night for our server and her customer skillset? 

We had a table of 7, 5 adults 2 children and 2.5 hours is well too long for a restaurant dinner, that is NOT a  dining experience.

It was lame.  

2 stars for food 0 for service.."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place! I am a huge Buddy fan so coming here was a must. It definitely was all that I expected and more. The service was great and quick. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and gave great suggestions. Our food exceeded our expectations. It was full of flavor and the the portions were great. We got a cannoli for dessert and it was AMAZING!!! I cannot wait to come back and try some more dishes, wines, and dessert."}
{"text":"I LOVED Buddy V's and cannot wait for my next trip to Vegas to go back. The atmosphere in the restaurant was great, but the food was what set this restaurant apart. I had the shrimp scampi and my husband had the chicken parm. Both were simply outstanding. Had I been wearing a looser dress, I would have been tempted to finish off the entire bowl of pasta."}
{"text":"Great place.  The marinara sauce was excellent and the motzerella appetizer was amazing.   We went between dinner and lunch so it wasn't crowded so,the service was very good."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. Came here for the second time tonight & they have nothing but fast, excellent service. Their alfredo sauce is on the secret menu but is to die for! Def. must check this place out. One of my favorites on the strip!"}
{"text":"The interior is really nice and the atmosphere is great for just a casual meal or a date.My server was really attentive and always checked to make sure everything was ok. I had the orecchiete and Italian sausage pasta and it was delicious. It was so good that I can't stop thinking about it. Even though the most popular item is the chicken parmesan,I have no regrets getting the pasta. I also ordered a special drink and was given the glass as a souvenir.Next time I'm in Vegas,I will make sure to get the chicken parmesan."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and incredible service! I look forward to eating here again next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Way good!  The chicken parm was fantastic.   Very tasty and much better than Otto down the street.  I couldn't be more pleasantly surprised by this meal.  The chicken was cooked through but not over cooked.  The breading was NOT soggy, was firm and crunchy.  Just a well executed dish.  The pasta was good too.

Services was attentive and nice!  I never had an empty glass and before I could ask for something like extra cheese, they were asking me.

Awesome!  Just awesome!"}
{"text":"We had Chicken Parm and Shrimp scampi. Both were delicious. Most amazing is of course Tiramisu. Made my birthday very special. Finding Tiramisu made right is hard and definitely this place has one of the best I had after a long time"}
{"text":"Our tradition is to go to Vegas every year and find a place to eat for Thanksgiving meal. I will be honest the price is high but the food is great. We have now gone to Buddy's twice now for the Thanksgiving meal.   We love the food. They have a version for kids or they can order from the kids menu. Note: you can order from the menu if you don't want the chefs menu. 

The desserts are to die for. We had the pumpkin cheese cake.  The kids had Chocolate cake and Nutella ice cream"}
{"text":"Very good... So much food we had a lot of leftovers. And the next day it was still awesome. I had lasagna and my husband had the chicken Parmesan (both our meals were so good). Nice place. Sucks cause we were too full to eat or have room for desserts. Happy note is Carlos bakery is right across the way. This place is at the Venetian."}
{"text":"Snap! I go to Vegas frequently and I ALLWAYS hit Buddy V's at least once! Everything is fabulous but the Cheese Ravioli is A-mazing!!! Save room for the famous deserts (the lobster tail is the best IMO)"}
{"text":"Their macaroni and cheese is the BEST that I have ever had! I wish it came in a dinner portion. Their service was nice and the atmosphere was relaxing."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed. But to be honest, I didn't expect to be either. While I had my moment watching Buddy master cakes on the Cake Boss, to attach his name to a restaurant wasn't as exciting as say, having a bakery with his name on it.

I will say the meal started strong with the meatball appetizer. You get large meatballs in sauce and both were very good. So it set the standard high.

One of my favorite items at Italian restaurants is the pasta vodka. While it was good, it wasn't great by any means. Just okay. I did appreciate the al dente noodles though. 

But the most surprising thing was the desserts. I get it, you want to include some family favorites like cannoli's, but still. No cake? What about featuring mini cakes that are decorated? Just something to play off the show. I just expected more than just three plain jane choices of sweets. 

I'll admit I sought it out, having the name attached and being new, but I wouldn't urge anyone else to visit this spot while in Vegas."}
{"text":"We made it to Buddy V's at the Venetian!  Tip: Park at Palazzo Valet, walk down to strip and up escalator next to Walgreens for a shorter walk!

We came during Happy Hour, 4:30-6:30 pm 7 days a week. We were here Memorial Day weekend, and it wasn't too full on a Sunday afternoon. The seating in the bar was really comfy with stuffed chairs and couches, high top bar tables with padded seats and bar seating with padded seats with backs. 

We tried one of everything on the Small Bites for $5 Happy Hour menu!!!  We also had the Butterscotch Creme Brûlée for dessert for $9. So creamy and great butterscotch flavor! It's a good sized bowl, but only about 1/2 inch thick, so not as many calories!

Ricotta cheese was smooth and creamy. It came with grilled buttered bread, and was a great accompaniment to the Olives and Pickled Vegetables, which was served with the same bread. There was enough cheese to also put some on the amazing and Must have Grandma's Meatballs. 3 large beef, veal and pork meatballs with about 1/2 of tomato sauce, sprinkled with a good amount of parmesan cheese. Our other favorites: the Calamari had some big tender pieces that I loved, there were crispy big pieces that that the little tentacles that our friend loved and some fried banana peppers that the spicy food lover liked. My wife's favorite was definitely the Mac and Cheese Carbonara, with smoked mozzarella, fontina, egg, pancetta and peas with a creamy sauce and golden bread crumbs. We got Roma style Gnocchi, which are little fried cubes of polenta with a little metal tub of marinara mixed with pesto dipping sauce-delicious. Crunchy on outside  and smooth inside, great sauce. The smashed meatball sliders was a fun little 2 bite sandwich with peppers on top. Same for Sausage and pepper sliders, which are a bit spicy. 

Loved the little to go novelty light up cup for the soda with unlimited refills for $7. 

Krystal waited on us, and was very happy and attentive. Manager Kristina Poole visited the table and sat and visited us for a nice chat. We got an update on the restaurant, it's sister restaurant in Bethlehem, PA and Buddy's moms health when we asked. The Assistant General Manager, Sean Fiori, came and whisked her away after a quick picture and check to make sure we were happy. 

Very nice evening, could be quick, but this time we stayed and enjoyed ourselves and they were not pushing us out after we paid the bill.

We are here again on 12/18/16 and it's all the same-menu, Krystal the waitress, me and my wife and Flower. She's having the Sangria. No hot chocolate for Tutu, they need to add it to the menu during cold weather.  She got some across the way at Carlos Bakery. Along with Cannoli and a strawberry cheesecake."}
{"text":"last minute decision to meet up friends in vegas and to celebrate my birthday. stayed at the palazzos and had dinner at buddy v's. we tried their popular lasagna dish, pastas, calamaris, cesar salad and a steak entree. everything tasted delicious and authentic, especially the lasagna. the pastas were done al dente with the right amount of sauce and flavor. it reminded us of italy. this is an upscale place preparing solid classic italian dishes. las vegas + great dinner experience = feeling like a winner."}
{"text":"Discovered Lunch Express Menu

I had done some research on Buddy V's Restaurant and found about their lunch express menu. For $22, you can choose an appetizer/soup/salad, your choice of entree and dessert. We had - the Caesar Salad - yummy and creamy. Salad was well tossed. OMG the cheese croutons! I could pop these nonstop! - the meatballs - quite yummy and tasty sauce - Spaghetti Bolognese - mum liked her meal a whole lot - Margherita pizza - fluffy and light pizza. - Bucatini Carbondale - the waiter recommended this dish. It is indeed one of the best carbonaras I've ever had. - Tiramisu - OMG - you don't taste the bitterness of the coffee very much. - Cannoli - crunchy she'll with a cream filling- it was OK Gelato - chocolate and vanilla - cools you down Thinking of coming back for their Sunday Brunch next time."}
{"text":"Traveled to Las Vegas and had dinner at Buddy's!
Restaurant was super nice and clean, open kitchen in the center of the restaurant. My wife and I had spaghetti and meatballs, a Caesar salad and garlic bread. Food was great and reasonably priced based on the quantity and quality. Staff was great and the manager on duty was very friendly."}
{"text":"We had the Aunt Nina's mozzarella and then proceeded to the bone in veal Parmesan (to split)--big mistake!  The veal Parmesan was great but holy cow -that alone for us to split was enough!!!!!  Great food-loved it...but now I am ready for a food coma...."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, as we are a fan of the TV show.  

Prices have definitely gone up.  Usually a \"traditional Italian\" (Buddy V's sells tradition throughout his advertising)  restaurant includes fresh bread.  Not this place.  Order the garlic bread, and await your bill $$$ .  The price of the drinks have skyrocketed as well.  The pasta is not fresh.   For the price of Buddy V's pasta, you have to offer some fresh pasta.  The deserts were actually terrible.   Not sure if Buddy V has actually dined at this restaurant for a while.  The quality has defiantly decreased.   We will not be going back here."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for some lunch after seei by Buddy's place on the map. The bread is great, my salad was so-so. We shared a combination plate that had lasagna and chicken parm. The meal was great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere special to celebrate our anniversary. We spent a good hour narrowing down Italian food restaurants based on reviews and the menu, and we were very disappointed with our experience at Buddy V's. When you walk in the atmosphere is very welcoming, dimly lit, guy playing the piano, and nice decor. That's where the nice experience ends. Once we sat down, our waiter tried to hard sell us on this wine that was clearly the wine the restaurant wanted the waiters to sell that night. We had to tell him \"not interested\" at least 3 times. I don't expect to get hassled and given the \"hard sell\" by our server at a really nice restaurant. The food we received tasted like it had been frozen and reheated. Definitely did not taste fresh. We started out with the Meatball appetizer. The meatballs had no \"crispiness\" to the outside. The sauce was thin and had no flavor.  My boyfriend got the Lasagna (which was supposed to be their signature dish), and I got the Pasta alla Vodka (normally very yummy if done right). The sauce with the Lasagna was runny and had no flavor. He even commented that the Lasagna I made at home tasted better than what he got at Buddy V's. As for my Pasta alla Vodka, the sauce was runny and had no flavor, the chicken was tough, and the pasta wasn't cooked enough. I went to an Italian food restaurant in Shenzhen China that had better Pasta alla Vodka. To top it off, the menu prices were $25+, which is kind of what you expect from Vegas, but I expect top quality food at that price, and especially from a celebrity chef. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"I was hoping that this restaurant was gonna be good... Big fail;( well we went for sunset menu ( 3-5pm) . We started off with the Buddy's Salumi n cheese board($19) as an appetizer...nothing special for the price. Then waiter asked if we wanted garlic bread (FYI not free it was $9 for 3 pieces) bread wasn't even warm, great Italian bread is a precursor to a great meal, not even close.  Menu was limited which isn't bad bc that usually means that the stuff on the menu is usually great...Uhm not the case. The linguine n clams ($25) portion small & there was spaghetti noodles instead of linguine??? Caprese salad($14) there was a whole tomato on the plate which was like boiled n peeled, unimpressed. The angus burger had no flavor n the French fries were overdone n cold, really??? 
Ok so after being disappointed by the food I was really looking forward to dessert... The XL lobster tail ($15) was so disappointing bc the pastry shell was hard as a rock n hard to eat. As you bite into it all the cream would shoot out bc the shell was so hard. The cannoli shell was hard as well, like a hard cookie ($9). If you had real cannolis you know that they are not supposed to taste like that. To top it off the coffee yes the coffee tasted horrible, like it's been sitting in the pot all day. For 3 people and sunset menu which is cheaper than dinner total $153 and that's with no alcohol..for that total there was not one thing I could say anything nice about. I had leftovers that weren't even worth taking home. 
Yes, I should of known better to go to a gimmicky restaurant. But I liked the show and I'm from NYC and was hoping for some good Italiano food n dessert. No love in the food at all. Don't waste your money n time going all the way to the crazy strip for this place. 
Buddy .....if your reading this or your PR person lets you know what's going on with your restaurant. This place is giving your familia a bad name. I've had your pastries in NJ. This place is not giving your bakery any justice. People who travel to Las Vegas and who will never go to your bakery in NJ are going to think that your desserts taste like this ( specifically in the restaurant) not good."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Buddy and his family and this restaurant did not disappoint. The bread they bring you is delicious. Our waiter (wish I got his name) was extremely kind and made small conversation with us which I loved. I got the cheese ravioli and it was amazing. My mother got the meat lasagna which was absolutely amazing. Definitely recommend that. My brother got the scallops and fell in love with it. The portions weren't huge (the turkey lasagna was a pretty good portion but the ravioli and scallops weren't huge), but were very filling! We had Canolis and lobster tails for dessert which were amazing. We had a great experience and it was 100 % worth it. So good in fact we are going back tomorrow for brunch!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it a lower grading this time because we did the brunch buffet and it wasn't that grand.  I had to come back here because of that AMAZING carbonara mac n cheese, but it was on the verge of awful this time.  The stuff in the brunch is not good at all compared to when they make it fresh for you!  It is to die for when it's fresh.  In the brunch, it's been sitting around etc, and isn't very good.  The salads were good.  The Caesar salad croutons are very different.  There almost like a cornmeal texture.  The arugula salad was delicious.  Chicken Parmesan was ok, but I'm sure it would be excellent if made fresh.  All around, the pastas were kind of disappointing.  It's cool to have a bottomless mimosa/Bloody Mary option.  Roughly $15, but it's bottomless.  Service from the bartender Emily was fantastic!  Not a remote complaint in that department.  We would come back, but won't do the brunch."}
{"text":"Wanted a good, affordable meal while in Las Vegas and Buddy V's filled the bill. It's a bit cramped and, of course, touristy (you should see the line for the bake shop across the way), but all in all was an enjoyable, casual Italian meal.

I had the clams with linguine and hubby had the lasagna. We started with mozzarella en carozza. All really tasty and fresh. I took cannolis to go - MY GOODNESS those were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"After a lengthy research online we picked Buddy V's at the Venetian for our Easter Brunch. The selection was not huge but all the items were fresh and had amazing flavor. The salad and bread selection even featured a traditional hot cross buns. Carved meat station had slab bacon along with an incredibly tender leg of lamb. The pastas and meatballs were an excellent nod to the Italian side and made me want to go back for dinner. My kids favorite item was the French toast. The cake boss did not disappoint for the dessert. Individual tiramisu was perhaps the best I ever had and the mini cannoli's had very flavorful filling but we're probably made a bit too early and the shells were already a bit soggy. Unfortunately the only downside to our meal was the grumpy servers and unfriendly host staff. It is a family atmosphere place and they all acted annoyed to be serving children. A pleasant attitude and a smile goes a long way to make you feel welcome. Overall we are glad we picked Buddy V's to celebrate Easter at. As locals we will most likely be back."}
{"text":"We went with the family of seven and wanted to pay separate bills. For some reason we were told we could not do this and had to put everything all on one bill. Imagine The fun at the end of the night of trying to divide everybody's dinner and then pay separately. But then being told that you can either pay on the all-cash or only on a credit card. thank God we had an accountant with us who could figure out each individual bill and tip. Dinner was very good, my meat was overcooked which they took back and then replaced. I did think they would have discounted my dinner a little bit since I did not get to eat with everybody, however they did not; but I guess it was OK because the food was good. We had two people that had birthdays, which we told them when they asked if it was a special occasion? At the end of the night they brought out two birthday desserts to share. The unfortunate part about this was that they charged us for these desserts which we thought were free since no one asked for anything! All in all the food was good, but the crazy bill rules and being charged for what we thought was a complimentary dessert on top of having my dinner late made it so that I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place was really good! Living in NJ, i'm spoiled with access to the best Italian food in the county (in NYC), so I'm a tough judge. But our food was delicious and the service was A++++. We had the mozzarella en carozza which was tasty with a chunky tomato sauce and pesto; delicious, but more like a glorified grilled cheese than the carozza I'm used to on the east coast. The complimentary homemade bread was great though. We also had the veal marsala and chicken penne alla vodka and both were GREAT. I was also pleased with the portion of everything; they weren't gluttonous but large enough for a small leftovers meal. I'd suggest it to anyone going to Vegas, but with SO MANY restaurants on the strip, I don't think it's a \"must visit\" if you're only there for a short time. Staying 4+ days? Add it to the list."}
{"text":"Don't request a different seat they will cancel your reservation! 2 dozen tables open and I can move to the one 5ft away without having to wait another 30min... Thought Buddy was all about customer service! Guess not."}
{"text":"The ambience and staff made our dinner memorable. We arrived a bit early for our reservation and they were able to seat us in no time. Since it was obvious that we were going to be seated at the bar section, Kelly reminded me that bars likely do not allow minors in their section since Katharine is only 17 so I informed the hostess. She apologized and asked us to return to the front for reassignment. For the next 10 minutes three other similar sized parties are seated ahead of us. We end up sitting in a table next to the waiters' cashier station. Not much of an issue since we were still towards the front of the restaurant. We open two of the three menus and the entrée pages are missing. Kelly walks over to the hostess station to show them this and picks up new menus. This slight hiccup at the beginning of the evening would've been disastrous for most establishment but Buddy V's made up and bent backwards to ensure our satisfaction. GM Christopher and his manager kept checking on us to make sure we were ok. We ordered the Caprese to start and had the Shrimp Scampi, Spaghetti and Meatballs, and Spaghetti Bolognese. All fantastic! We finished with the Apple Pie topped with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream. They do a really good job with their food. If you ever get the chance to visit one of their restaurants, it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"The first impression I had was \"housekeeping\" they need to do some serious cleaning in that place! The chandeliers although very pretty were dusty as hell. There was a display of fake food on the right hand side... It was covered in black dust. I work in the customer service industry and I'm sure that the dust that had been accumulating was there for months. 

When I go to a establishment of that caliber, I expect it to be spotless. No excuses. 

About the food, the pasta was great but the portions were rather small. The chopped summer corn salad was a fiasco. It tasted like if the corn and green beans were poured out of a can directly to the plate. If the story was different than the one I'm telling, well taste and appearance didn't make the trick. 

Needs a lot of improvement. Definitely underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Food was good but overpriced. There are other restaurants in town just as tasty for almost half the price. 

I had high expectations for the Lobster Tail XL and was extremely disappointed. The size, first, and then the shell of the pastry wrapping the custard. It was so hard I could barely chew it, much less finish it. The custard itself was good though. 

The bake shop outside of the restaurant is all I'd ever go back for.  Their cinnamon cannoli's are much more worth the price for their quality."}
{"text":"A revisit here did not quite replicate our earlier 5-star experience.  The restaurant was not as accommodating as before, and did not honor our reservation request for a booth.  Instead we were seated at a table where one-half of my party of four was temporarily blinded by the sun near sundown.  Then we settled in, and things soon improved.

Grandma's Meatballs covered in Red Sauce (Sunday Gravy) were authentic classic Italian meatballs, and Aunt Nina's Mozzarella en Carozza was a hot and cheesy confection once again.  Calamari Fritti was another nice starter.  And the complimentary Focaccia Bread was great.

A big side of Caesar Salad was good.  And Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno was again one of the best lasagnas I have ever tasted--besides Diane's vaunted cheesy and saucy concoction which won the 2014 Ardiente Lasagna Baking Championship in a blind tasting by judges.  This time I did not even bother to finish the whole rich lasagna dish.  I filled up on half of what was presented to me, and took the other half home.  Alas, Diane failed to persuade the chef to make her Veal Parm Alfredo, and had to settle for a good Veal Marsala instead, which unfortunately arrived late to the table.

For dessert we were served great Cannoli compliments of the chef, to make up for the late arrival of Diane's dinner entree.  Service was excellent except for the ordering miscue, no peppers offered on the side of the Calamari Fritti, and no available Roasted Potatoes this particular evening.

4-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"Hey,  ba da bing, ba da boom, I'm at the Cake Boss's joint.  You gotta problem with that?  Cause if you do,  he knows a guy who knows a guy! 

That said,  and it needed to be, I rarely eat southern Italian in restaurants because growing up in NY, I had the good fortune to eat the real master chefs cuisine,  my grandmother,  father,  aunts and friends parents. Anyway my point is,  I'm seriously biased. 

My goal was to eat something tasty and not heavily laden with sugar,  flour, carbs as I'm in the middle of a book about that stuff which is gross, scary and fascinating all at the same time.  But,  I digress. 

I went for lunch and ordered grandma's meatballs and a side of Tuscan Kale with roasted tomatoes.  While I get that we didn't use real San Marzano tomatoes here,  it did come close to replicating an authentic flavor.  I should point out that meatballs to Italians is a very serious and personal matter. My extended family can argue endlessly on the what constitutes the perfect meatball, whether there should be inclusions such as pignola nuts, raisens and tons of other stuff you can't possibly imagine. 

The Tuscan Kale wasn't on the menu,  but Star, my server,  not wanting to disappoint,  checked with the kitchen and they said they could do it.  I was very happy.  That's service! Problem was,  it came out very tough, chewy and barely edible.  So I appreciate the extra effort,  not the result, and the results are what matters. Once you commit to me, I'm expecting your A game stuff. 

Appropriate classic Italian Frank Sinatra,  Dean Martin, Louis Prima and other legends sang in the background. I'll go back ang give them another try for dinner."}
{"text":"Buddy V's Ristorante is a lovely place to go for home-style cooked Italian food.  The menu offers a variety of appetizers, salads, pasta, chicken, veal and seafood.  Last but not least, the cakes are insanely delicious- not surprising, seeing the restaurant is owned by the Cake Boss himself.  Do whatever you have to do to save room for dessert!

Our server brought us a tray of freshly baked focacia before the meal.  It was so fluffy and warm.  i could have eaten a whole tray myself!  My sister and her boyfriend shared some of their fried calamari appetizer.  It was great!

The cocktails were wonderful.  I tried my sister's martini called the Cake Boss- red velvet cake, chocolate liqueur and Bailey's.

The restaurant sadly did not offer any Alfredo entrees, which are typically my favorite, but my Chicken Piccata (breaded chicken cutlet in a white wine & butter sauce) was excellent!  The side of pasta was also very good.

I tried my mom's Eggplant Parmesan and was very impressed!  The food truly tasted like we were eating a homemade dinner at a family member's dining room table.

Even though we loved our meals, the best course of the meal was dessert.  I had trouble deciding what to order.  The Cannoli, Butterscotch Creme Brulee and Nutella Cake all sounded so good.  Our server recommended that I try the Italian Birthday Cake- Rum soaked sponge cake with cannoli filling, chocolate pastry cream and toasted almonds.  It was heavenly!

The restaurant's ambience is perfect for a nice family dinner.  It is beautifully decorated with a combination of vibrantly colorful kitchen items and upscale decor.  The restaurant has an energetic and happy atmosphere,  They commonly have upbeat live music playing, but at a reasonable level so you can hear the people at your table talking to you.

The service is also amazing.  The employees make you feel like old friends of theirs- definitely the ideal Italian kitchen."}
{"text":"BEST DINNER OF THE TRIP!!!!! I got a caesar salad to start, the carbonara, and Lisa's Nutella cake! OUT OF THIS WORLD. The only problem was I was so stuffed by the time dessert cake I couldn't eat the whole thing lol. The ambience was very laid back, with piano music playing as we were overlooking the Las Vegas strip. The musician even came over to the tables to see how we were enjoying ourselves. I eat Italian food very regularly as I am Italian and from Boston, and this was up there with the best Italian dishes I've ever had!!! 

The busser was so sweet and attentive we thought he was our server at first! Could not bring us enough bread or help us enough!! However the waitress had no personality, was rude when we asked about the happy hour specials and really did nothing for out experience. Overall I would recommend this to all!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on the way back to California. First of all, we were greeted when we went in. We were sat down right away. I had the Blackberry Collins (drink) and it was delicious. My brother had the drink with Jalapeño and mango and it was so good. Alex Rivera was thee best server I have come across. His skills with explaining the menu to giving us options on what is the \"thing\" to eat. I ended up eating the Osso Buco. It was soooo tender and the flavor was impeccably mastered. I highly suggest going here. Ask for Alex to be your server! I was impressed, hopefully you will be too."}
{"text":"I went here for a small meal with my parents before departing for the airport.  Among us 3 we split a Buddy's pizza and a pasta carbonara.  Pizza was quite tasty and good, very flavorful, but I thought it was too salty for my full and complete enjoyment.  The pasta arrived in a small-lookin portion, for the price we were paying . . (~$23?).  It's not like I was expecting Cheesecake factory portions, but given the price, the pasta could have either used a bit more pizzaz or a larger serving size.  It was a very .. bland okayish dish overall, something I feel that I could have made at home.  Definitely a skippable dish."}
{"text":"I was in need of a sweet fix since Carlo's Bakery right across the way was such a let down. Buddy V had a happy hour, so we decided to take a seat in the bar area where the live band was setting up. I tried a red sangria. It was so bad, I could only take one sip. I also ordered Lisa's warm nutella cake. The nutella was missing and the cake was dry until you reach the middle where the chocolate sauce oozed out. The combination of the cake, ice cream, and the praline crunch paired well together, but the ice cream was the best out of the three, although not amazing. The dessert wasn't as bad as his cupcakes. I just expected more from the Buddy brand. Our waitress and the ambiance were great, however."}
{"text":"Sorry Buddy but everything as just Ok for me. Had the meatballs, lasagna, and a antipasti lasagna was the best out of the 3. Also had the red velvet alcoholic bev. Just ok. I was really rooting for it to be good. Good luck and good eats!!!"}
{"text":"Soooooo pleasantly suprised by this place. Went to the famous Cake Boss bakery since there are only 2 stores world wide! After standing in line at the bakery we found ourselves starving and impatient so we decided to just go into this sister restaurant right across the hall. Went in with no expectations and having read nothing about the place and was totally blown away! 

I had the chicken ceasar salad cause after spending 3 days in vegas all I wanted were vegetables and water. The romaine was crisp, the dressing was yummy, and the crutons were the star of the dish... parmesan polenta crutons!? That's a thing? You're damn right that's a thing and it's amazing! Would give it a full 5 but they were a bit skimpy on the chicken. 4.5/5

The man ordered the Philly Cheese Sandwich which was also delicious. Crisp and soft bread, ooy-gooy cheese, juicey thin slices of perfectly seasoned meat. It's not a traditional Philly in any sense but it's truely one of the best I've ever had. 5/5

Might I add they offer the dessert we were standing in line for at the bakery. Kind of wish we had just dined here and ordered a pastry for dessert!

Would definitely dine here again give it a shot for sure!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a fun weekend and then a conference, so I got to try Buddy V's twice. The first time was for a late Sunday brunch, but we just got there too late for the buffet brunch, which looked really good. Gonna definitely have to come back for that some time.

Me and my date tried the salumi plate, which was pretty good, especially since it came with crispy grilled baguette slices. Schmeared some of the blue cheese on a slice and then layered the salumi and prosciutto for a nice little open face mini-sammy. Yum! I ordered the chicken parm, which came with a side of spaghetti marinara and my date ordered the caesar salad and we split them both between us, which was more than enough food since the caesar was pretty good size and the chicken parm came with two equal sized filets covered with cheese and sauce. The caesar came with polenta croutons, which were amazing and would have been a great appetizer on their own with a side of red sauce! Crispy on the outside and warm and fuzzy in the middle. Almost took away from how good the caesar was. My date thought there was too much dressing, but I like it that way. The chicken parm was awesome! Probably the best I've ever had anywhere. Good thick tender piece of chicken, nice breading, and great cheese to chicken ration with a nice marinara on top. But the coup de grâce was the unassuming side of pasta on the dish. I don't know what it was, but it was just spaghetti marinara but the size and texture of the pasta was just amazing. It was like the unknown actor stealing the spotlight from all the big name actors in a movie! 

I went back for lunch later in the week and got the Express lunch for $22 which included a 3 course selection. I got the caesar, spaghetti bolognese, and lemon sorbet. All were awesome, expecially for the price. But the spaghetti again was amazing. And the bolognese sauce was nice and thick and held to the pasta like glue. Easily the best spaghetti dish I've ever had. Again, I don't know what it was about the pasta (size? texture? taste? perfectly al dente?) but it was like crack in pasta form. I can't wait to go back! And this is from a guy who try's not to eat pasta much because it's a carb bomb. And I don't think I've ever had a more perfectly balanced sorbet. Not too sweet, not too tart (lemon sorbet). And 2 big scoops! What a great way to finish the meal and cleanse the pallet!

Well done, Buddy V! Well done!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was just ok for me.  We went on a Saturday for lunch.  Service was ok, but not great. The food was ok, but nothing outstanding.  Finally, the prices were high for what was served.  Now for more detail. 

My husband and I both had salads.  I had the panzanella, which is mozzarella and grilled bread on a bed of greens.  The bread was wet and mushy.  The greens had way too much dressing.  The good news: the tomatoes and cucumbers in the salad were delicious.  

My husband got the Sicilian charred octopus. He said the octopus was nice.  The problem is, with so many outstanding restaurants close by, \"nice\" just doesn't make the grade.  

Sorry Buddy!"}
{"text":"Love eating here everytime when visiting Vegas ! All the food , and staff are excellent ! Always AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!!! Last night I was craving Italian food and noticed this restaurant across the street from my hotel. I'm so glad we found it. The food was great and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening and was able to get a table pretty quick by sitting in the bar area. Eggplant parm and spaghetti and meatballs were both excellent, lots of seasoning, tons of flavor. Service was great, very polite and friendly wait staff. Will absolutely go again next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Been watching cake boss and drooling over their food for years looking at it on the show, and tonight we finally got to go! Everything was fantastic! Had 2 three course dinners (Mama's meatballs, salmon, and a cannoli and then the chicken parmesan, and nutella cake) and at 38 bucks each, you can't beat that for huge portions at a relaxed atmosphere on the strip. The staff was super accommodating and made us feel welcome and relaxed as well. If I could give more stars, I would! :)"}
{"text":"We had the surf and turf, finished every bite! Excellent food, it was cooked perfectly. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"For the good:

The bus staff was the best thing about this place, making sure your drink was filled and bread was on  the table.  The ones to clear as well.

For the bad:

I know there is over 300 different types of pasta, but the waitress should at least learn the names of the ones where they work.  She didn't know the difference in the dishes, when I had a question.  I asked for the dessert menu up front, so I could decide if i wanted salad verse dessert, she never brought it.  (finally got it from the bus staff).  Slow to do service, waited a long time to pay my bill at the table.

I ordered the carbonara, was not happy with the type of pasta, but more important way too much \"cracked\" pepper on it.    The bread/focaccia was just average.  

For the real bad:

About an hour later, made my stomach very ill."}
{"text":"The calamari was truly the best I've ever had!  Hot and Tender as butter with a  wonderful dipping sauce!  The lasagna was huge, 7 layers, cheesy deliciousness 

The grilled salmon was divine and the scallops were tasty.

Great view, service and ambiance, however it was a little loud.

Do Not Miss the butterscotch creme brûlée!!"}
{"text":"My husband has gotten my birthday cake here for the past few years. They never fail, it is always the best! My favorite is the strawberry shortcake. Yumm!"}
{"text":"Went here for the Nutella cake. Common with the cake boss reviews you have to try it.  The cake was amazing with a nice hot interior and fresh taste.  This is a cake that kills every dessert that I have had.    Wonderful melt in your mouth sugar high.  Is this heaven ?"}
{"text":"While vacationing in Vegas with family we decided to check out Buddy V's at the Venetian.  It was a very pleasant experience for our party of seven.  The restaurant itself is lovely with a tastefully decorated interior and comfortable seating.  The service was excellent, very professional and courteous from our waitress to the bussers. The complimentary bread with Olive Oil and Balsamic Dipping plate was delicious, the bread warm and fluffy and the olive oil and balsamic very flavorful.  The Garlic Bread Appetizer was so tasty, warm and very cheesy...we ate every crumb.  The Salumi & Cheese Board Appetizer was outstanding...very flavorful, quality, thinly sliced Proscuitto, Cappicolla and Salami along with Grana Padano and Parmeggiano, and Gorgonzola Cheeses and delicious olives. The entrees were a home run for all seven of us.  The Veal Marsala, Chicken Parm, Chicken Picatta, Steak Pizzaiola ...all perfectly cooked, good portion size and the accompanying Broccolini and/or Buttered Spaghetti Noodles just made the dishes even more pleasing.  The Sunday Gravy signature dish was excellent, the sauce authentic Italian and the combination of meats reminded us of our mother's and grandmother's typical Sunday dinners.  The wine selection was impressive and our Pinot Grigio and Chianti choices did not disappoint.  Loved this restaurant ... the best dinner we had in Vegas during our trip."}
{"text":"This joint was classy and service was great. Located in the Venetian Hotel, this is one of many great Italian restaurants that offer a unique dining experience. My mom and daughter and I were all under the weather with a stomach bug and was disappointed that we couldn't get the upmost experience but we ordered the shrimp scampi, served with pasta. The shrimp was huge fresh and delicious. My daughter and I split the Filet served with mash potatoes...fabulous in both flavor and presentation and they divided it for us at no extra charge. We were so upset that we were not feeling well enough to experience anything on the dessert menu. I hope we can get back soon. I only have two complaints: the music was really loud so it was really hard to have a conversation and there were two, I assume, managers, one man in a suit and the other a lady, who cased the joint like they were one of the Sapranos...I understand they are paid to keep the place running smooth but I felt like if you had checked his pockets, you would find a pair of brass nuckles or something worse #RoadtripUSA"}
{"text":"Best part is the view of the strip from the bar. It wasn't super busy. Slow service from the wait staff, arrogant manager on-duty, and one-drink-at-a-time bartender make this restaurant experience drop a couple of stars. The positives are a very nice greeter, fast kitchen and casual Italian ambience. Skip the basics, don't get the spaghetti or lasagna al forno because they are not much better than local joints. It's expensive for what it is, so you might as well go for the good stuff. Try the veal or chicken parm, veal Marsala, and the bar. I'll try it again and hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Another favorite place to eat! The only negative is that it is really loud and difficult to have a conversation. We ordered the family style meal with the appetizer, dinner and dessert. It was a homerun! 

The variety was perfect for our group of 7 and there was plenty to eat. I included the before and after of our dessert plate just to give you an idea of how fantastic it was. 
I would like to go there when it's not so crowded next time."}
{"text":"Excellent service with Casey and Georgio! The group of 20! The food was great. No complaints."}
{"text":"The clams and linguine, AMAZING.  The where cooked perfect.    The bread that was brought to the table was very fresh and really liked the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.   Service was excellent."}
{"text":"While waiting in the super long line at Carlos bakery across the way I noticed this restaurant. (Found out later that they are connected) My friends and I had already decided on Mexican food for dinner but I wandered over to look at the menu and inquire about the wait time. As soon as I walked in I was in heaven! It smelled amazing! The prices weren't bad and the hostess sad she could seat our party of 4 right now so I went ahead and followed her to a table (with an incredible view of the strip!) I never went back to my friends... I just texted them and told them we had a change of plans and would now be eating Italian at Buddy V's! We told our server, Casey, we had reservations and were kind of in a rush. She was fantastic and told us which dishes to avoid because of a longer cook time and made a few recommendations on dinner and wine. We ordered Salmon, spaghetti bolognese, chicken piccata and ravioli and all four of us loved our dishes. As promised, Casey had us out of there in under an hour and we made it to the show with time to spare! Great food, great service, great views & I can't wait to go back! Next time I'm ordering dessert because they looked delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Its a little pricey but its Vegas after all (everything in Vegas is pricey).

Hubby and I had the Sunday brunch for $35/each. It was decent but I have to tell you, the bread pudding was one of the best I have ever had! 

View was awesome. Waiters were friendly."}
{"text":"This review is for happy hour and not any of the meals. $5 sangrias were incredible and dangerous - barely tasted like alcohol until they hit you. We got the ricotta cheese small plate, and while the cheese was pretty bland, the grilled filoni bread was incredible!"}
{"text":"My last meal before heading back to oc was here during summer. It's so hard to leave Vegas when you are having fun and with family. I celebrated my mom's bday early here and service was beyond exceptional. We 5 of us were seated in a booth, dinner was about to begin, it was a Sunday but eating here made it feel like we were really away on vacation. The calamari was well seasoned, not too much battered, and crispy. We had Moretti's and it went well with our meals. I love Italian food and the pasta was cooked perfectly and not too al dente.  For us cali drivers, a heavy meal is not the way to go before heading home. Plus the 100 degree weather doesn't help so much. We were stuffed and with to go boxes. They gave us a little cute cookie plate for dessert. I want to come back here for a romantic dinner next trip. Thank you Buddy V's!!"}
{"text":"First thing I am going to say is\" I am so sorry Buddy! I love you, I love your show! I love your charisma, but unfortunately the food at your Las Vegas restaurant is very disappointing. ;( We came here on Dec. 24 to celebrate my daughters first birthday, this i will give you though, your staff is excellent! Great customer service and great ambiance! They were very accommodating and on top of things, Kudos on that! We ordered various things from desserts to appetizers, the most disappointing item was the veal, it tasted funky and it had a weird smell to it, so i returned it and they graciously took it off my bill. the tastiest item we ordered was the linguini with clams, but it wasn't amazing, the other items like calamari, osso buco, grilled cheese, was ok, but not great as well. The lobster tail dessert was just horrible, it was as hard as a rock! I am sorry to say that my expectations were a bit higher, especially since the menu was a bit pricey, but even if the menu was more reasonably priced, the taste was just not exciting my palate. I mean overall it was a fun time, I don't regret celebrating my baby's first birthday there, hey at least the baby loved the free bread sticks, but would I come back? Maybe if somebody else paid, i would be willing to give it another shot, also keep in mind that they just opened this location, and every restaurant will always have its growing pains, that's why these reviews are necessary."}
{"text":"One of the best places for a lasagne on the strip! This place was honestly not the first place we had picked to go for dinner that day, but some how we ended up there and we were not disappointed! The service to begin with is AMAZING. Our server told us that one lasagne would be good for the 3 of us, but we were being naive and didn't want to believe it. So we got 3 lasagnes, because of the high praise from the other staff as well. Our server was not joking, that lasagne is one plate you might never finish in one sitting. All three of us finished only about a quarter of our lasagnes before we were stuffed to our eye balls. We literally couldn't move. But it was so delicious, form the sauce to the meat and the cheese! They also make fantastic drinks and offer great insight on the various dishes. The restaurant offers great views, and even though we didn't get to try it, we heard the high praise of their cheese cake!

TLDR: Get one lasagne for 3 people, you will all be stuffed!"}
{"text":"It's one of the best happy hours in town. Prices are great. Only 5 dollars for appetizers and 4 or 5 dollars for drinks. I can tell that they have the best  fried calamari in town. So soft that they are melting in your mouth . I tried my boyfriend's gnocchi and loved them too even though they are totally different from real Italian gnocchi which you try in Italy. Just a different recipe, not a big deal. The environment is very classy and it has outdoors. There is also Carlo's bakery just in front of it where you can get a desert if you like."}
{"text":"Carlos bakery was too packed so we decided to go to Buddy V's Ristorante instead to taste some of the desserts. We sat in bar area and our waitress/bar tender was not good. She barely spoke, her hair was in my drink and she really didn't do anything more than what she had to. We witnessed another customer, 2 women waiting to be served. They started at the bar, moved to a table, moved to another table and waited and waited and the waitress/bar tender never helped them so they left. It wasn't busy either. As far as food, I had the Italian cake and I wasn't impressed. I'm not a cream person so maybe that's why I didn't like it."}
{"text":"Terrific Happy Hour, 7 days a week, 4:30-6:30 pm in the bar and lounge!  This has to be one of the best deals on the strip, and the best part is it's not just a deal for deal's sake, but it's good quality too. 

We stopped in after having been at another happy hour nearby where it was quiet and more expensive.  Buddy V's was like a happy hour explosion in comparison, complete with live music!  I had $4 wine, while Husband had $4 beer.  We shared two $5 plates of Mac & Cheese Carbonara and Sausage & Pepper Sliders.  Both were really really good!  Warning though, that is a HOT pepper slice on top of the sliders (looked like a slice of tomato to me).  Really good sausage.  The real star of the show was that Carbonara.  Brilliant to make a mac & cheese version of it.  It was rich and creamy and the peas added a nice pop of freshness. 

We would have ordered a lot more if we hadn't just come from another happy hour.  Next time, we'll head straight for this one, or come for a full meal, as we were impressed enough by the quality.  Our Server Gal did a great job, and we enjoyed the free entertainment of the Brothers so much that we tipped them well."}
{"text":"Perhaps I went during the wrong time. My husband and I visited, unbeknownst to me, during restaurant week. Perhaps they prepared their food ahead of time. All I have to say is that I was disturbed by my meatballs. I was flat out disappointed by my meatballs. Those were not good meatballs. 

I had spaghetti and meatballs. My first cause for concern was that our dishes came out insanely fast. Never a good sign in my book. I'm not at Burger King, I do no expect my food to arrive in less than five minutes. The meatballs were small and when I split one with my fork, it did not crumble like a freshly made meatball should. It was hard. And I bet you anything it had been frozen at one point. Sauce was incredibly bland. I was incredibly disappointed. 

Main cause for disappointment? This was not my first time here. I've had their meatballs before. They were heavenly, delicious, tasty and FRESH! 

Saving grace was their Italian Cake. That was pretty good. But as for the meal, all I can say is how corporate of them."}
{"text":"I had a surprisingly solid lunch here the other day. First of all, the view is a big selling point., overlooking the strip. They have lunch specials and they are relatively reasonable in price for a restaurant on the strip. 

I ordered the Italian hero with Caesar salad and my friend ordered the meatball appetizer. The sandwich was really good. Perfectly cooked bread, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The meat was flavorful and had a nice kick. The tomato tapenade added a nice spiciness as well. I tried some of my friend's meatballs and they were great. Moist and well-seasoned. Some of the better meatballs I've tried in town.  

We couldn't stop by without trying some dessert, so we gave in and ordered a tiramisu as well as a Nutella cake with salted caramel gelato. The tiramisu was enormous, large enough for four people to share. The Nutella cake was not overly chocolatey and wonderfully paired with the caramel gelato. I'm not typically a fan of Nutella or cake but this was the perfect combination. 

They are opening a Carlo's Bakery across from Buddy V's, which will be a great addition to accompany this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fried calamari appetizer was delicious. Chicken parmigiana was just ok, needed more seasoning, came with a side of spaghetti which was delicious, wish the portion was larger though. The lasagna was just ok to me, it has Italian sausage in it and I don't care for that. A bit pricey for what you get, but it is Vegas, so expect to pay. Outstanding service, on top of everything, very friendly, polite and polished. Would definitely return, but would definitely get the large bowl of spaghetti instead."}
{"text":"I guess I missed the part of the show where Buddy went to Vegas to start a restaurant??  I'm a huge fan who occasionally watches episodes of Cake Boss and dreams about going to Hoboken to taste his food.  So when I heard about Buddy V's Ristorante during this recent birthday trip, my heart skipped a beat and I told my husband we HAD TO go!

From the outside, the charming decor mimicked that of a quaint cafe nestled in the corner of somewhere in Italy (or so I'd think, since I've never been).  It drew me in!  I love how it felt homey yet upscale inside.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  Our food took a while to arrive but the taste more than made up for it!  I ordered Nonna's Lasagna.  Oh my!  It was as if I've never had lasagna before!  There were so many layers with meat and cheese that just melt on your tongue.  That good!  I wished my stomach were bigger just so I could have more of that lasagne.  It was a very generously portioned dish.  My husband ordered Mama's Style Chicken.  He loved his dish too!  

Oh and don't get me started on the dessert!  Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake was perfect for my birthday treat - chocolate cake drizzled in chocolate sauce with caramel ice cream.  Scrumptious, to say the least!  They decorated with \"happy birthday\" and our server sang to me in Italian.  It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.

The customer service was amazing.  Our server was funny and accommodating.  We had our baby with us and enjoyed a memorable dinner out.  What more could you ask for in Vegas?!  Definitely one for the books!"}
{"text":"My sister label this as a glorified Olive Garden and she was completely wrong. She doesn't appreciate authentic Italian food, carbs and all. Food was outstanding, we had chicken parm, spaghetti and the lasagna at our table and we all tried bite of each meal and all were very delicious and tasteful. Service was a little slow to getting our order and then getting the check but he was a great server none the less, very entertaining. I love the family atmosphere they had as well as the touches of family in the menus. We also had a bottle of the moscato which was amazing with our meals. Highly recommend this place for some good cabs before a night out on the strip!"}
{"text":"We grabbed dessert at Carlo's, and realized that there were not very many tables to sit and enjoy dessert, so we headed over to the restaurant bar.
Our server was very nice. She was attentive, nice, and pleasant to speak too. Ordered a few drinks, chowed down on our Canoli and chocolate mousse cheesecake, eventually we ordered some food (mac and cheese, calamari, they are standard off any Italian menu, however they were delicious!). The ambiance of the bar was very nice, it was packed and had a live singer (with a VERY nice voice, Thanks to the Fabulous Baker Boys!) it was so romantic, and straight out of a movie- I was so in love (we were on an anniversary trip:).

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it all, and look forward to visiting Buddy V's when we in town again! :)"}
{"text":"What a dining experience. My wife and I ate there last night (not our first time) and from the time we were seated to the time we left everything we great. Generally I'm not one to sit too long. Eat and go is my style but our window seat over looking the Vegas strip, sunset and great food put us in no hurry.
Great evening 
Thank you"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. So we went with all the great reviews. There were 4 of us and we all enjoyed everything we ordered! HUGE portions....no room for dessert at the end :(  !!!!! Oh well, next time start with dessert and then go backwards!

The server was very kind person! The rest of the staff that we dealt with were very friendly! I would recommend this place highly. Remember...share a plate that way you can order dessert!!!"}
{"text":"Impeccable service.

Great ambience!

Fantastic view of the strip.

BEST. FOOD. EVER. 

EVER!

If I could, I would eat the chicken parm here every night for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Was really skeptical when my husband told me we were meeting friends here for dinner. So many times famous television chefs have a restaurant and it is not very good...this was not the case with Buddy's!
The service was exceptional. She recommended three different meals: Chicken Parm, Lasagna, and Chicken Rigatoni. We had the Chicken Parm, the Chicken Rigatoni, and I went for the Chicken Marsala, as it is one of my favorites. Each meal was delicious! There was not a speck left on our plates! 
I will definitely return AND recommend it to all,"}
{"text":"Brunch Boss

Parking:

Located at the Grand Canal Shoppe closer to the Palazzo side so it is nice stroll from the Venetian Parking structure. Where parking can sometimes be a pain but usually plentiful.

Establishment:

Service was okay it was a tad bit slow but not annoyingly so. *3 stars*

Food (Brunch):

To begin there is an all you can drink for about $15 which is probably worth it if you plan on having more than 1 drink. Bringing your total to about $50 a person. 

The concept of quality over quantity definitely applies here there is probably about 10 dishes of breakfast items and some Italian dishes some of their Italian dishes were just okay though but nothing I regretted trying.

What shines here though is their dessert. They have a glorious display of desserts that will be sure to satisfy your sweet tooth. *4 stars*

Overall:

First brunch in Vegas so nothing to compare to but for the price I thought it was very enjoyable especially after 3 sangrias."}
