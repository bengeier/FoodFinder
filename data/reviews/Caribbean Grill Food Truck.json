{"text":"So I have been burned by yelp reviews before, but this time they sent me to a delicious food truck! The jerk  chicken was decadent. If you have a low tolerance for spicy, however, probably stick with the beef patty. I promise it tastes WAY better than it looks. We also got the jerk chicken burrito special, which was all the flavors at once. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pro: Their spicy mac and cheese is the best mac and cheese in town by a mile.   The people are also very friendly and helpful.

Con: The rest of the food is a bit mediocre for the price. 

Overall, I hope they can expand and grow their operation.  We need more Caribbean food in town!"}
{"text":"Tasty Jerk Chicken meal comes with rice and choice of side - can't go wrong with fried plantains. Big meal and enough to fill me up, but a little pricey for a college student budget: $8.75 with tax. Very quick order fulfillment is definitely a plus. It's a good deviation from Cracked every once in a while.

{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. My favorite items are the Mac and cheese, beef patties, pineapple rum cake and jerk meatballs. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the jerk chicken and mac n cheese!! I'm always on the look out for this food truck!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Mac and cheese I've ever Had. It has a great kick to it without being too heavy. I got the jerk chicken which was pretty spicy and good on a hot day! Tasted of cinnamon and clove and cayenne. It's fun to watch them chop it up w a big butcher cleaver as you order it. The people working here are so pleasant. I stopped by at lunch and the employees were all in a good mood telling me how they were all appreciating the fact their air conditioner was working on a 90Â° day. Their stops are listed on their website if you're wondering where to track them down."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time yesterday, and the food was delicious.  Will eat there again."}
{"text":"Really delicious food! I got the jerk meatballs with rice and peas. Perfect amount of spice. I think you get a lot of food for the price, too. Yum!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place thanks to their Sunday lunches for February. Our meal was very good. Wonderfully fresh and flavorful. Very nice service too! I wish I could make it for Wednesday's lunches."}
{"text":"Did I expect to find the best jerk chicken I've had in champaign IL? 

No! 2016 has been a crazy year, so I'll take all the good surprises I can get."}
{"text":"I've been to Jamaica eight  times and Caribbean Grill make some of the best Jamaican food off the island. Top shelf food and super friendly service."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!!!  The jerk meatballs are my absolute favorite but everything is great.  I can't wait to have Caribbean Grill every Wednesday.  Customer service was great too."}
{"text":"Caribbean Grill's Lunch to Go Wednesdays is the highlight of my week! Their food is DELICIOUS, with just the right amount of heat. I love their spicy, fall off the bone jerk chicken, their rich, cheesy mac 'n cheese that surprises you with a kick of heat, and their wonderfully sweet plantains that I can't resist ordering extra of. I also love that they let me customize my order. I can substitute mac 'n cheese for the rice 'n peas, or get all flats of the jerk chicken wings. I can't wait until they get their food truck going, or better yet, open their own restaurant. They get a solid 5 stars from me (only because I couldn't do 6)! I highly recommend them to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and a really great staff. I have been acquainted with Mike since a few years back, after writing a small article in a local newspaper about Caribbean Grill. He is super nice and dedicated to what he does.

The food is consistently delicious. I have tried the jerk wings, mac and cheese, plantains, rice and peas (beans) and the upside down pineapple rum cake. Great flavors and spicy-the way I like it. The upside down pineapple rum cake is the best I've had of its kind. So good. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I tried this awesome food truck for the first time today and the Jerk Fish was absolutely delicious! A little bit of sweet and a tad more spice! The cabbage was phenomenal as well! I will definitely be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Let's start with the Mac n cheese. It's soooo good. Not your traditional Mac, very original and by far the best I've ever had. The jerk sauce on the food is perfectly spiced. The cabbage is well seasoned the plantains are good and sweet. The peas and rice are good; never dry! The chicken, tilapia and jerk burrito is yummy! The staff are professional and courteous the truck is very clean!! I recommend you try this place every day!!"}
{"text":"Tried it today and LOVED it! The jerk chicken and mac and cheese were amazing!! Will be back next Wednesday to try to meatballs. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is FANTASTIC! If you don't know what to get, I recommend starting off with the Jerk Chicken Wing Meal. It is so delicious and flavorful. I'm a heat freak, so I didn't taste any spicy heat in these.

Do you love mac-n-cheese? What about plantains? Well, they got you covered! These two sides are marvelous to your taste buds.  They'll be singing for the rest of the day.  When I first saw the food truck I sparked up a conversation with a girl about the food.  She was a huge fan and absolutely loved the mac-n-cheese. Let me tell you, while talking about the mac-n-cheese I could see the girl literally having a food orgasm, then and there.  I was SOLD!  The other sides are good too, no complaints.

Oh yeah, the side of mac-n-cheese and plantains they give you is literally a tease to your taste buds. Do yourself a favor and just pay extra for a large side.

PRO-TIP:  Mike and the crew are very classy and prompt. So if y'all want in on the food(yes, they do run out) you need to show up as early as possible to secure it."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. I seldom order chicken when eating out because it almost never meets my expectations but I've had their Jerk Chicken meal multiple times- that says a lot! Very tender, moist, and flavorful chicken, and a generous portion too. Makes me hungry just typing this. I always get it with the steamed cabbage as a side. And the plantains are delicious! Service is fast, friendly, and efficient too, great place to grab a quick lunch. Too bad I don't have photos of the deliciousness, will add some when I next have them."}
{"text":"AS GOOD AS IT GETS is correct.  I've been meaning to come here for ages and today I finally did.  While the food may look simple, the flavor blows your mind.  I ordered the patty with plantains today and love every bit.  And the portion was perfect for lunch.  This is my new favorite food truck."}
{"text":"Tried it and was disappointed. Got the Jamaican Beef Patty meal. Things tasted like they were microwaved and sat around too long. Not fresh. I thought it was worth trying upon initial impression (never had \"Jamaican\" food before, sounded interesting enough) However, the prices are high for mediocre food. Not worth coming back and in this competitive market - I don't see this food truck staying around without a big rehaul to their pricing and menu/portions. No one wants to eat a pile of dry rice and beans with a little bit of gravy. The Mac & Cheese had a consistency of being left out for too long and not hot enough. If you need inspiration for a killer menu, fresh food and market appropriate pricing, look at Cracked. They did a great job.

On a good note, the guys working there were really friendly."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Caribbean Grill. On wednesday's they have \"Lunch to Go\" at the Refinery and it is amazing! Typically I am skeptical about trying other people's Mac and Cheese but I was pleasantly surprised. I would identify all of the good things on the menu that you should try, but honestly all of it has been great! Try everything!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, not bad but from the reviews I expected something special. They charge for every single little thing that you may ask for, never seen any other restaurant charging extra for one serving hot sauce or \"not\" having ice in your drink! Ridiculous. Customer service was a big turn off to me. Hope you enjoy your experience. 
--This review is for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't expecting a lot. I moved to CU a year ago and thought about coming but I avoided it at first. Why? I haven't had good Jerk Chicken in a long time. I got tired of ordering it from restaurants and food trucks and getting weak a** chicken that has spices or sauces  thrown on it with the label \"jerk chicken\" and people who think they know Caribbean write reviews raving about how great something is.

The jerk chicken is about the process and preparation. It's also about how it's served. It's also the same about the plantains. 

If you're basic and you don't like eating meat off the bones, go to Buffalo Wild Wings and eat that. If you want something authentic with chicken that falls off the bone, come here. The rice is on point too.

This food truck has honestly the best jerk chicken I've had outside of Jamaica. It's the only Caribbean restaurant in miles too. It's worth it, eat here, love it."}
{"text":"Their Friday fish special is amazing! If you plan on eating lunch anytime soon, look up this truck's location and get there!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is beyond delicious. My go-to is the jerk meatballs with a side of steamed cabbage, and mac and cheese - all are so well-seasoned and come in good portions. Staff is always so friendly, too!"}
{"text":"They did our company Christmas party and it was a huge hit! It was my first year putting together the party, and there were some big shoes to fill from last year. 

I'm very happy to say the CG blew them away! The food was great, the drop off was perfectly on time, and we got a great rate for it all! 

I'll definitely be working with this great team again."}
{"text":"Nothing else like it in the Champaign-Urbana area! I've had the jerk chicken and jerk meatballs, and both are extremely flavorful and phenomenal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"In spite of good reviews, I remained skeptical that the food would be authentic. I'm very discriminating about food in general, but since I've been yearning for more quality carry-out, I gave CG a try. I am now a true believer and can testify that CG is the \"real deal\"! The chicken was tender and juicy, with the perfect amount of jerk spices. Between my husband and myself, I think we had all of the sides and found them to be as delicious as the chicken....really! Way to \"bring it\" CG! Many thanks to Yelp for the email on local food trucks because I would never have gone on campus otherwise."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of attending CG's soft opening and as always the food was consistently great. Highly recommend the oxtails and fruit punch. My daughter enjoyed the chicken and mac-and-cheese."}
{"text":"Terrible service at their main location on Neil . So, this is a main location they recently opened. Ok, I liked their food. So I ordered in a Friday night at 7:15 (they close at 8:00) they lady told me, we don't except phone orders. I'm 5 mins away, ok.... I get there, (7:30) they no longer (serve food after 7:00)  like wtf.... whatever, y'all ain't taste like Chicago. any. Damn. Way."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible! Savory, fresh and authentic Caribbean food! Amazing price for the quality. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My first experience with the truck was at an outdoor concert at Allerton Park last night in Monticello, IL.  The food was awesome!  Red beans and rice, crazy good meatballs and spicy mac and cheese.  Can't wait to try again some time.  Supposedly they ran out of food later but I'M SURE that's because this particular concert drew way more people then these concerts usually do and they were not expecting to feed so many."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is a must go! Finding good jerk chicken is sooo hard but I have finally found it here! The rice and peas are some of the best I have ever had! It is so good that I will be going back again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I had the privilege of attending the soft opening of their new restaurant. In short, this place is going to be a hit with C-U residents.

They've got an expanded menu with retail items like sauces and seasonings, along with the original menu items that we've come to love from the food truck. The prices are honestly too low for the amount of food they give you. Get there early when lunch time comes and the restaurant opens for real!"}
{"text":"I'd heard from a lot of people that this food was great. I got the jerk chicken but unfortunately I don't have a high tolerance to spicy food and after about 3 (tasty) bites could no longer taste a thing. Good food but not for people who don't handle hot stuff well. There's even chillies in the mac and cheese. Staff were really friendly and music was good."}
{"text":"The BEST and most AUTHENTIC Caribbean food around. This spot is a true GEM to the CU area. Coming from the east coast, getting used to not having regular access to all of the food that I love was hard. However, once I found CG I found a piece of home! The jerk chicken and rice ' beans are my favorites. Very affordable and great customer service!"}
