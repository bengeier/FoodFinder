{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Saw this place the other day and wanted to try it. Finally did today and it was a huge let down. Way over priced and way under flavored. If you're a pasta place, your pasta needs to be awesome and this definitely did not deliver. Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"Whenever I send a gift from ZiaPia, the recipient always says its one of the most thoughtful gifts they have received in a very long while.   I routinely shop at ZiaPia for Xmas presents and really any other gift occasion.  They have an amazing product selection and Victoria can customize a gift for any and all occasions.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Zia Pia but sadly I wasn't all that impressed. Which makes me so sad to say because the service was lovely and the concept is great. I ordered the mixed fruit French toast breakfast. It came out quickly but sadly, for $10 is was one small pancake like peice with only blueberries (and also fantastic cream). The problems I had were the price to amount of food ratio and the description of \"mixed fruit\" when it's just blueberries. I will definitely be giving zia pia another chance and try some of their Italian food."}
{"text":"The service here sucks. The cashier started taking my order then stopped to answer the phone and take a pick up order. Not sure why she couldn't ask them to hold? I then asked if an item came with a side salad. She said yes. I ordered it. Kitchen didn't put the side salad in. I asked for it. They said it doesn't come with a side salad. I said your cashier said it does. So the cashier comes over, forgot who I was in the five min since I placed my order, and said that doesn't come with a side salad. I told her that she had said it did. She said I did? oh I must've been confused. I said well that's why ordered that item because I wanted a side salad. So she finally asks the kitchen to get me a side salad. I paid $14 for this sandwich; is it that big of a deal to have the side of lettuce you told me it came with??"}
{"text":"This is our first time here and we had the best experience ever. I am very picky about my Italian food. And as a very small and unpretentious place it feel makes you feel like you are in Italy when it comes to the flavors. The marinara sauce is one of the best I have had. The Emelia salad was so perfectly dressed that you didn't need anything. And the Italian ricotta cheesecake pie was so well balanced in terms of richness and sweetness. Definitely we will be back and recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great italian foods you can't find anywhere. Three visits and loved everything I have bought."}
{"text":"I'm just going to sit here and daydream about the giant delicious meatball panini I just ate. It was like the Platonic ideal of a meatball sandwich. I've also had their cheesecake and it was delicious. Definitely worth a stop if you're passing through 7th St. Market."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this counter in the back of 7th street market.  Thanks to places like this, we like coming to the market.  I usually order the butchers salad, absolutely loaded with prosciutto, mortadella, salami, cheese and roasted red peppers.  Not cheap but worth every penny, high quality meats, cheeses and a nice mixed green salad underneath.  I also always get a pasta dish here for my wife and I to share.  I went with egg noodles add meatballs and red sauce this past time.  Pasta was a wide egg noodle that was cooked nicely and in the pan with the sauce so it really sticks to the noodles.  Meatballs were very tender, also made in house, solid.  With the offerings of fresh food, Italian specialty grocery items and confections, this place has it all.  Nice wine stand right next to them as well for the perfect Italian meal!"}
{"text":"Zia Pia Imports is located at the very back of the 7th Street Public Market.  I'm usually there in the morning, so during an early afternoon visit, I decided to give it some love and ordered \"The Gigante\", a sandwich billed as being so large that it would specifically not be served with a side salad.

Well, the description did not lie.  This sandwich was absolutely enormous.  It was on what I can only describe as a ciabatta roll on steroids.  It was salami, ham, and mortadella (i.e. fancy bologna), with provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a garlic aioli.

The roll was tender inside with a slightly crisp crust, perfect for this sandwich.  The meats combined into what would normally be too rich for a single sandwich, but what saved it here and elevated this sandwich into more than the sum of its parts was the aioli.  Billed as a garlic aioli, it really should have been called a lemon aioli, since that is what punched through all the richness of the meats and cheese.  It was smooth, bright, tangy, and a perfect foil for the cured goodness stuffed within.

For such a large sandwich, I shouldn't have finished the whole thing.  Well, I finished the whole thing and was stuffed for the next four hours.  Was it worth it?  Well, let's just say that I'll be actively seeking it out on my next afternoon trip to this market."}
{"text":"I usually find myself picking up a drink from this vendor at 7th street market. They have the San Pellegrini flavored beverages that I love so much. They are always very kind and have a cute little shop!  Check them out!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended that my family of 3 check out Seventh Street Public Narket while we were in town for Rounds 1 and 2 of the NCAA men's basketball tournament.   I chose to get my lunch at Zia Pia, and am happy that I did.  I ordered the Rustichella sandwich, which was prepared with prosciutto di Parma, fresh mozzarella, lettuce, olive oil, balsamic, and tomato on a crusty baguette.  It was absolutely delicious, and I wish I lived closer so I could indulge in one every week.  The pasta side salad was also excellent.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came and browsed around here while visiting 7th St Public Market for lunch. They have a great selection of imported pastas and hard to find speciality items. The most interesting among them, fused olive oils where the flavors are actually pressed with the olives rather than being steeped in the oil. I didn't get to try a sample myself but I overheard a couple stating that the basil
fused oil was \"amazing\". They also have a full menu of which according to the clerk is made using the items in the shop. Everything in the case looked delish especially the cannoli!

I ended up selecting a San Pelligrino pomegranate aranciata.  It was bright and fresh with the perfect amount of fizz. I love all of the San Pelligrino drinks but this is by far turned out to be my favorite one. I have never seen it anywhere else so I will certainly be frequenting Zia Pia to wet my whistle with this delicious beverage time and time again. I'm also looking forward to trying the fused olive oils next time around too. 

Such a charming little spot with such friendly staff."}
{"text":"So this place is tucked in the very back of the building near the rest rooms if that helps you. Like all of the 7th street market places they are set up more for lunch but they were one of  just a few places that was open when we went to try and catch an early dinner recently. I had one of their speciality salads which was very good and they used local fresh produce which was nice.  Their menu is Italian style dell which is a nice addition to the 7th Street Market line up."}
