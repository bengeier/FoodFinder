{"text":"Great cappucinos, a friendly owner, reasonable prices and a nice atmosphere make this my go-to cafe in the Vaughan area.  The owner delivering my cappucino to my table in a real cup was the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"A bocci ball throw away from Canada's Wonderland in Maple resides this exquisite little cafe known as Zona. Wanting to find out a bit about them before I would show up I had the most pleasant phone call with one of the owners. While I didn't have the opportunity to catch her name the things I learned about Zona were so amazing that I needed to try them out for myself - and now I am a fan and a believer.

While this place positions itself as a cafe it also has a hot table that made me drool (despite just having my lunch before arriving). Everything looked hot, fresh and beutifully cooked. I am more than a little excited to try their veal sandwich combo next time I stop by. Looks Delish and like great value :)

Being that it was just after lunch I decided to ask for one of their famed coffees out of their AMAZINGLY unique espresso machine - A Victoria Arduino! For those not familiar with these machines allow me to elaborate, a VA is essentially the Ferrari or Maserati of the espresso/coffee world. Made in italy this machine is a site to see with its smooth lines and curves, pearly white exterior PLUS it makes a damn fine espresso/cafe!! Mamma Mia!

The staff at Zona will tell you that their VA is the biggest in Vaughan and potentially in Ontario....maybe even Canada! A likely tall tale BUT given what I saw that day I can believe it. Worth the trip just to see this baby purr!

Having recently been introduced to the glory that is an Americano I decided I would test the taste of their espresso and ask for one of my new found fav hot bevvies. Now this coffee came with an extra special treat ... a story on the history of the Americano....

Essentially the drink was developed during WWII by Italians when serving espresso to American troops stationed there. A straight espresso was too strong so the Italians weakened it for the AMERICANOS with some hot water. Hence the name Americano! Bet ya didn't know that!! I sure didn't!

What can i say about my drink other than AMAZING. It was hot, had a strong flavour and perked me up quick time! This place was a great trendy spot to work or hang out during the day as it wasn't overly busy, was far enough away from Wonderland to discourage the teeny bopper crowd AND they have free wifi (just ask for the password)

The best part was that the staff was super friendly and welcoming similar to that of any Italian family. Come by this place - I might be working here we can have an Americano together and check out Victoria :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Victoria Arduino, the Espresso Machine which seats quietly on the counter at Zona Caffe.  It's such an aesthetically pleasing machine and it gave me an excellent Cappucino.

It's not one of the easiest place to find and DAILY citizens would not know this place exist as its located hidden behind some building in a somewhat newly added office zone.

A couple men were seating outside sipping their ESPRESSO beverages when we walked in to the empty shop around 11:00 am and the staff/owner lady greeted us.  We were still curious as to the Breakfast menu displayed and she was very accomodating to it although it was closer to Lunch.

We sat in a modern environment with those sleek STYLISH seats that I'm not very fond of but that aside we were happy to see CP24 on the wall unfortunately the audio was a bit loud for relaxing conversations.

I got the BACON & Eggs($3.99) deal that came with 2 Eggs, Buttered Toast and my choice of Sausage and I wanted to add Potatoes($1.49).  Extra Egg($0.99) availabe upon demand.  

Nothing special really except the Potatoes which were very crisp and delicious almost reminding me of Chips.  It seems to be cooked with a Cast Iron GRILL Pan to give it some groove patterns and seasoned with the basic Salt and Herbs, I'm loving it.

The BEST part was the Cappuccino($2.38) here.  I can't really describe it but all I know is that it has made Zona Caffe my new place in the area to have this drink.  

While Zona doesn't incorporate as much aspects of the All-in-One Italian Food Shop that has been growing in popularity in this region, it does have enough to make it a valid place to have Breakfast & Lunch.  Afterall, Coffee is the MOST important meal of the day."}
{"text":"BLESSSSSS! Man, I love Italians. 

It is a rare occasion that I get to have Italian food. In markham, there are not many and I rarely crave it so I barely go. However, after having a work sesh here, I am completely in LOVE! 

The cafe is huge and clean. It has a friendly environment, which is comforting. The owner is extremely friendly and it's great to know that there's authentic espresso + italian food here!! She's oh so sweet and takes her time with each customer and even delivers your coffee to your table. Have I mentioned I love Italians? The cappuccino I had was one of the best I've ever had and upon mentioning this, Kris U. pointed out that they had the Victoria Arduino, a beauty of an espresso machine. Or I'll put in his words \"the ferrari of the espresso machines\"

After doing some work here (no words of rushing from the owner, which was great), I was then introduced to italian hot tables and the beauty of it all. All the food looked amazingly fresh, and they were! The penne ala vodka... DAMN GIRL, that was off the charts. Pasta texture was great quality and not just plain ol' cheap no name out-of-the-package stuff. Sauce was delightful as well. I also have to give a quick shoutout to the veggies, which were extremely fresh. 

Good vibes here, y'all. You need to check this place out! The reviews are amazing for a good reason."}
{"text":"Great coffee,  awesome atmosphere,  great food,  wonderful service. Very friendly and fair price. A diamond in the rough of Vaughan."}
{"text":"Most aromatic delicious cup of cappuccino that I can remember. I have had coffee all over Europe over several decades and I know good coffee and this the absolute best in North America. Compared to this coffee you can pretty well consider Starbucks to be dirt water. The flavour unbelievable and the foam just perfect thick dense and creamy. Can't wait to go back. Just dreaming of it now ...."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here one afternoon when I was waiting for my ride.  I thought I'd grab a coffee and twiddle my thumbs.
I instead discovered that they carried cupcakes.  RED VELVETS!
I ordered one, and it was honestly THE BEST i've ever had.  And I have tried a lot of cupcakes my friends.
Turns out this place gets them shipped frozen from the CheeseCake Factory.  They also have Double Chocolate cupcakes, which are absolute heaven, and Vanilla Bean which are simple and amazing.
There espresso is strong, syrupy, and delicious.  
There sandwiches are hearty and made on scrumptious breads.
However there rice ball was rather, well gross...
The atmosphere is clean and modern and the service is warm and inviting.
Check it out!"}
{"text":"Very good coffee and pastries. The owner is very friendly. I would want to come back for their lunch buffet on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"You have to spend over $5 so getting just a cappuccino isn't an option.  They don't even know how to warm up a sandwich since the inside is cold. Wasn't the best warm cold sandwich either.  

But hey at least the cappuccino was done right."}
{"text":"found it be accident. in the building for unrelated reason, could smell Italian sauce from the open door. Yummmmm,  went in and found amazing hot table with option to dine in or take it to go. 
    Will go back, it was good and prices very reasonable.   Clean inside."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since I work in the same plaza.  The food is always made fresh, the staff is very friendly and always make sure you're happy.  Prices are reasonable. 
Plus don't forget to try the many chocolates and deserts they sell."}
{"text":"All these pretentious trendy cafes in the GTA... you know what's your problem? We people just want to have a good decent cappuccino at a reasonable price!! And please serve that in a cup.. a real cup!! 

Zona Caffe serves their beverages the way that Italians would have enjoy their espresso or cappuccino back home! Nice, simple, strong to start the day or wind down after dinner... from a nice Italian mama barista! :) 

And of course, the price is hard to beat!! $2.50 tax in... 

I did get table service since my cappuccino was delivered to my table while I watching CP24!"}
