{"text":"The food is certainly better quality than dorm food. However, it is over priced for the portion that you get. The only reason I would eat here is if I have class down stairs on the same day."}
{"text":"I love this place. The menu changes daily and now the cafe is using foods from local farms and businesses (Prairie Fruits Farm, Pekara bakery, UI meat sciences dept...)! As mentioned previously, you can get a great balanced lunch for under $5 or get stuffed silly for maybe $7 (they have $2 and under desserts that look tasty). Some of the menu items sound a little strange, but be daring because these kids know what they're doing! I tried a cold salad with potatoes, apples, bacon, candied walnuts, and chicken... yum. Today I had indian stew with lentils, veggies (carrot, bell pepper, onion), salmon, and tilapia.. super yum! It came with verrrry tasty fried pitas. love it! They always have lots of options for discriminating palates and take cards!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots. They really try to accommodate all kinds of diets and most meal choices are healthy options. Main dishes are $5-5.50 and sides are $1-2, so it's really reasonably priced. And definitely check for their Hooked deal, it's a 50% off discount, which means you can eat there for around 3 bucks."}
{"text":"This place is solid.  It's cheap, especially for campus.  The menu varies day to day, which keeps things interesting.  You probably won't love every dish they make, but there's little displays so you have a pretty good idea what you're getting.  The prices have increased a little from what other reviews say, to $5 an entree for lunch and $0.75 for sides.  But I think it is usually worth that.  Some things I've had here: Pastrami on marbled rye: was quite tasty.  Maybe not quite as flavorful as the Beef Stand, but cheaper and closer for me.   Fried okra: is the best I've had in town.  Yum. FSHN chips sandwich: I was a little disappointed in this one - there seemed to be less fish than breading. Beer battered cod and chips - was pretty good. Mushroom and turkey panini - also pretty good, and satisfying on a cold  day. Manhattan clam chowder: I liked this a lot, it had a tasty broth and many chunks of fish.  I'll have to try the soups more often.  Overall: since there are multiple dishes, it seems like there's usually at least one thing worth trying.  I've never had the salads or desserts, but they look pretty good.    Service has been good every time I went, though obviously this depends a bit on the students working.    I've been pretty happy with the food, I kinda like the cafeteria style set-up, and the price is right.  I'll be coming back here to try out more of the menu.  Great for a day when you forgot your lunch or just need a break and some tasty grub.  Since I found it, it has become one of my regular lunch spots.  And you can look the menu up online before you even walk over: http://beviercafe.illinois.edu/index.cfm"}
{"text":"Bevier cafe has significantly improved in 2013. There is much more consistency in the preparation, seasoning, and portioning of dishes. Orange chicken is still too sweet and syrupy, but overall, the quality of food is much better than before."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Pretty good price. Sandwiches are a little small, but the sides are cheap. The service is really fast. My girlfriend says the portions are good for girls, but not for guys."}
{"text":"A great spot to grab lunch during classes.   I like that its student run and a different set of options each day. However meals are very overpriced, and I wonder who is turning a profit."}
{"text":"I ma having a continued, ridiculous love affair with Bevier Cafe.  You see, I have a class from 11-12 in Bevier Hall, and the cafe itself is exactly one floor below my classroom.  Did I mention I get out at noon?  When lunch is served?  Yeah, you do the math.  It's a damn good thing that B.C. is relatively cheap ($4.50 for a major entree, or sandwich), or I'd be broke and panhandling in front of the place at this rate.  The Food Service students run a fantastic local cafe that helps them get hands on experience and gets me lunch time eatin' on the cheap.  There's always a vegetable side, some mouthwatering dessert, and the space is cheery and pleasant if a bit utilitarian.  Bevier's well worth the visit.  That said, it's basically cafeteria style in that you pick up a tray, select your food options, add on bread, dessert, drinks, etc, then pay for your meal.  They'll give you a number, and a smiling food service student will bring you your food--often eerily promptly.    Now, my only request is that you don't crowd up the place when i come charging in all hungry like.  Cuz that's not cool.  But go check out the cafe, with a fantastic array of food orders (and a daily changing menu!), you're bound to be satisfied."}
{"text":"The food here is great and relatively cheap. It's super convenient that it's at Bevier, which is basically my second home. The only thing is that the portion size of the food is rather small, but it usually fills me up. Definitely recommend everyone here to try the butter chicken at least once if it's on the menu for the day!"}
{"text":"When I read the positive reviews on Yelp, I expected to fall in love with Bevier Cafe.  After going to Bevier Cafe yesterday with a couple of friends, the good news is that I don't dislike the place.  We arrived a few minutes before the cafe closed, and they were out of some of their entrees.  The food we got seemed to have been sitting out for a while, and it wasn't as tasty as I anticipated.  Also, their service seems kind of disorganized--you take a tray, tell the people at the counter what you want, pay for it, go sit down with an empty tray, and then the employees bring you your food.  Couldn't they just hand the food over the counter?  Or just have real servers?    Even with the not-as-good-as-expected food and the confusing service, I like the concept of Bevier Cafe.  I'm happy to support a student/university-run restaurant, and I will eat there again."}
{"text":"Nothing says awesome more than one dollar cookie.  Especially when that cookie is as big as your head.  When you're looking to eat cheap.  When you're looking for an AMAZING meal.  When you're looking for something on South Campus, even if you're NOT a student, head to Bevier Cafe.  You've never had a dorm food experience like it, I promise you.  The only reason this place loses a star is because... despite it's upscale menu and the quality of the food they put out, it _is_ still a dorm cafe.  There's not much to be done for a building that was built in the fifties, so you eat in a place that consistently reminds you of that office setting in Joe vs the Volcano, but still.  You'll never eat better!"}
{"text":"Hey, they are now serving local dishes every day. There are many local farmers raising delicious top-quality animals and heirloom produce...which you can now eat for $5!"}
{"text":"i love this place toooooooo!! they are sterile and yummy. :) reminds me of a daily changing ikea cafeteria and i love ikea.  i love coming here for lunch.. and since i'm at IGB these days, i don't even have to leave my building! it's awesome. their menu changes... but it's always decently priced for alot of food! Great soups for a buck with any entree! That's awesome enough for me."}
{"text":"i love bevier cafe and i fear it may be my new go to destination for lunch over all the overpriced sandwich/pasta shops in campustown.  you can get a delicious full sized entree for under $5!! the ambience is a little like a dorm cafeteria but the service is efficient and the food is really tasty.  They also offer portable coffee mugs for $10 with $.50 refills for an eternity after! take that, espresso royale!!  on my graduate student budget, it sure makes me warm and gooey inside to know that i can get real food (and the elixir of life- coffee!) at such an affordable price and in a convenient location.  sure beats my made in 30 seconds pbj for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Great menu, they put a lot of care and thought into the food, AND ITS GREAT.  The use of local ingredients, at an affordable price, makes it even tastier.  Just watch out for the crowd during lunchtime--you'll likely have to wait a while (10 min or so) to get your food, but they bring it to your table and its absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Bevier Cafe has some great deals for good quality food. I love their food, the lasagna is great! But the dessert is just okay. I'm a sweet freak, but even I have to say that the dessert is too sweet, but not enough flavor. Other than that, the food is delicious and nice for a quick bite."}
{"text":"It's a treat!  Great prices and value.  Convenient location on campus. The food is tasty and I love supporting the University of Illinois Food Science students."}
{"text":"Convenient place to grab lunch in between classes. Bevier Cafe is entirely student-run and has a rotating menu of dishes. The portions are somewhat small and the prices are a bit on the expensive side, but you can usually get a $2 discount on the Hooked app."}
{"text":"It's convenient.  It's cheap.  Dessert is always good, and again cheap, so I only feel guilty for being overindulgent, not for spending too much money.  The menu rotates and there is always a vegetarian option.  You order your food, you pick up salad (if you must) and dessert (you must) and get your drink.  Sit down and a cheerful student delivers your hot entree to your table.  And I don't have to go outside to get there.  Bonus!"}
{"text":"Ever since I discovered it a couple of months ago, I have practically been living here.  It's a nice cross between a fancy restaurant and a cheap cafeteria.  There are always at least a few dishes to pick from, rotating daily.  They also have a house salad and Greek salad every day.  They charge $5 for (practically) every entree, which is sometimes too much, sometimes too little for the dish.  On the other hand, all sides are $0.75, so it all kind of evens out.  They also have rotating desserts, but always have big, soft, fresh cookies.  Although going through the line to pay with your tray feels like a cafeteria, the seating is basic, but very nice, wooden, and pretty comfortable.  You sit with a number and relax and wait for your dishes to be brought to you--which usually isn't too long.  They do serve breakfast, but I haven't been able to try it yet.  The convenience of being able to check the menu on the website pushes the score to an A+!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite lunch spots on our campus. They have a clearly well-crafted menu with quality ingredients and the price is very economical. You can catch me here at least once a week. Sometimes you cna find discounts on the Hooked app and they also have a punch card for a free meal after 10."}
{"text":"This place holds a special place in my heart Haha. They have delicious black bean burger and their butter chicken is delicious and very popular! Fresh items and salads. It's a great student - run place and they do listen to the feedback you may leave! Sometimes they have Hooked as well. If you're in with a sweet tooth, grab their delicious cookies or 7-layer bar. My fave!"}
{"text":"The students do a great job running this place!  I have always experienced excellent customer service and great food.  The portions run on the small side which is perfect for me."}
{"text":"The cookies here are amazing. Especially the White Chocolate Pecan. They are so rich and delectable. I also had the South Western Fiesta Turkey and Corn Salad and the daily special- which was Chicken Gumbo. It all cost about $11 which is more than I was expecting to pay but I was very full.   The Salad was great. And I NEVER like salads. I generally go out of my way to pay extra for an alternative but I noticed that the salad today looked pretty good and I was glad I made that choice. It was chock full of fresh vegetables, juicy chicken, and great taste! The salads here are wayy bigger than the entrees.   I was not impressed with the Gumbo. I can't put a finger on it but I have to say that the overall flavor was not appealing..."}
