{"text":"Ordered delivery. Driver was awesome and called when he was on his way. The pizza tasted good. Only reason not 5 stars is because the crust was very soggy in the middle and not cooked all the way. Also had the chicken wings which were pretty good"}
{"text":"'Free delivery.' Hope you like it taking close to over two hours. Ordered a medium pizza, fries, bread and soda. They forgot the soda. We had to call them twice because they were taking so long, and the guy informed us that they didn't 'see my place.' So just decided to never call me and keep my money. After yelling at the manager I got my order over two hours after order and I live less than two miles away. Food tasted bland as well."}
{"text":"We ordered a medium spinach pizza and a caesar salad. We were super impressed and will be ordering again. The food was here in less than 45 minutes and was fresh. The food was AWESOME! The delivery driver stayed in contact with us to keep us updated on where our food was."}
{"text":"This place... Lol should have ordered from dominos if we wanted something slightly above \"cardboard\". I've never seen a flatter, drier, less flavorful pizza in my life. The crust was burnt, there was enough sauce and cheese on the entire pizza that should have been slotted for one slice. My wife is pregnant so one of the pizzas we asked for \"white\"/Alfredo sauce; instead of Alfredo sauce they just neglected to add sauce entirely meaning the pizza consisted of:
Burnt crust, minimal cheese, skimped amount of ingredient... Yum?

Oh yeah and we found 4 pieces of hair. Should have gone to aurellios or somewhere that actually knows how to make a pizza"}
