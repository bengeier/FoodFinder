{"text":"I love Heidi's!!!  I go here often and always receive friendly service and delicious food.  My husband and kids love it too.  As many before me have said, the bread is fantastic. We buy loaves when we are there so we can enjoy it at home. I've tried the eggplant parm sandwich, egg salad, veggie, grilled veggie and a few others and all have been excellent!  I'm a vegetarian, so it's nice to have lots of choices here.  My husband has had roast beef, Italian, pastrami and other subs and has always been happy.  I send friends and family here. Everyone has been happy.  I highly recommend Heidi's!"}
{"text":"One day a co worker came into my office and asked if I wanted half of his sandwich.I asked him what it was he said egg salad with a kick . For the record I am a bit of a snob when it comes to sandwich salads and egg salad is one I am most critical of! I was hungry so I took it 

That was six months ago and the beginning of my love affair with the Hells Kitchen. Spicy Meets Creamy with avacado to balance the flavors out with a crispy bacon crunch  to stimulate the palate. Have it on Marble Rye made fresh daily and you have a unique sandwich experience 

For 5 bucks you get a made fresh sandwich your choice of sides ,pickle home baked cookie and a drink!

Thanks Hedi for adding 5 lbs for 5 bucks!"}
{"text":"Another great lunchtime location.  They make a great Reuben sandwich smothered in kraut and nestled in the most delicious marble rye bread.  I usually get half corned beef and half pastrami.
The only downside to this place is the usual long line of people.  I go there probably about once every other month, and I don't think I've ever been there without waiting in a line at least 5 or 6 deep.  I think the ever-present lines say something about the place."}
{"text":"Ended up at this Deli because every other restaurant in the shopping center was closed.  There's a reason this one has made it there.  Excellent egg salad sandwich! Prices were decent and the service was good."}
{"text":"Reuben, no thousand island, with mayo....awesome! Pastrami or corned beef!

Service is good, but can be abrasive so be prepared. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best place to get an affordable, quality sandwich on the west side!

I had the BLT with avocado and a berry smoothie. Both were delicious. The ingredients were high quality and everything was made with care. Service excellent. 

A few reviews have indicated that the price seems high, but the quality is head and shoulders above a cheaper sandwich. And portions are very generous!"}
{"text":"This is a solid MY style deli on the west side of town. They have a great selection of items and the prices are killer. Why the he'll would someone go to jimmy johns across the street when you have this place?

They make their bread from sctrach every morning and you can tell. Its really really good bread. Excellent flavors and consistency. 

I recommend trying the turkey avocado sandwich or the French dip sandwich. Both have great flavor combinations and are always on point here. They told me they make their potato and egg saldas fresh every morning so Ill be giving that a shot next!

If youre a drink juice fan they have that locked down too."}
{"text":"Star deduction is for the teeny bags of chips that come with your sandwich....Otherwise I had a great experience.  The staff were all very friendly and my sandwich was awesome.  Authentic Brooklyn?  I don't know and I don't really care, the bread was fresh, the veggies were crunchy, the sauces they put on were good.  So yeah, go git cha some!"}
{"text":"went there for lunch , realy wanting a good deli sandwich? well i have to say that the (guy making) the sandwich looked at me like i stole somthing, and made me the worst sandwich ever////  He seemed to go out of his way to give me the (ends of the bread). hard as hell///////. took 2 bites and trew out.  B.S. if the people working there dont like there jobs please leave. dont (screw me) on my lunch?  he was a hispanic and i got the im pression that since i wasint (white) he treated me a lot differnet than the other guest??????Thats why the one on Gibson road is closed?  Treat all your Paying Customers with a little respect and they will return.  Your Job depends on it."}
{"text":"Food has been great. Potions size for potato salad and coleslaw are on the smaller end. Ordered from UberEATS three times and they have forgotten something on ever order so I suggest not ordering. I had to change my password to post this, so, yeah I'm that irritated."}
{"text":"This is not a real delicatessen. Heck, it's not even a decent sandwich shop. Your better off at Jimmy John's... Really."}
{"text":"Ive gone to Heidis for a year or so now because my work is right down the road. Today our whole office ordered from here. I got two salads, one for lunch and one for dinner (we work long shifts). Half way into my first salad I discovered a dead fly in it. This is just disgusting, I understand there are flies in the air at times, but when its dead in a salad, they clearly didn't wash their lettuce properly. That's a good 18-19 bucks down the drain, and no lunch or dinner for me today. I will not return after this experience."}
{"text":"Love this place, they have the BEST corned beef sandwiches around! A little pricey but not horrible, a little dull inside. But all around great sammies."}
{"text":"Okay so maybe it's not authentic Brooklyn blah blah blah, it's a chain store, located in LAS VEGAS...Would you go to Jack in the Box for real sour dough bread? Who cares (obviously all the disgruntled yelpers below)? I like the food here and I'll come back. 

The service at this location is good. I'm always blown away when staff make eye contact and enunciate. I was blown away! Oh and my order wasn't all jacked up either, that indicates that they were actually listening. How nice!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I eat there all the time. The staff are sooooo nice....they even know me by name.  The food is great and the it's at a great cost.  It's very affordable.   Cindy and Daryl are great!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and the place is clean!! The owner (or maybe he is a manager) is very friendly!! Sad because the staff kind of walks all over him and they aren't as friendly but the food is really great and they have a nice variety. They are also really great at lunch hour about getting people through the line WITHOUT making them feel rushed."}
{"text":"I  just wanted a french dip sandwich.  I watched them heat my au jus  in the microwave in styrofoam ??.....Always new employees and clueless.   The sandwich was so tough I could not even chew through it.   Even my dog tossed what I offered.  Meat so tough no one would eat....Maybe it was old, sat there for hours?  I just figured a local deli would have fresh meat..........Sadly fake french dip at Arbys was 10x as good.    Least it had a 
 flavorful taste and au jus that was not microwaved in fumes.     Sorry my event was 
unsuccessful."}
{"text":"I had never eaten at Heidi's, folks from the office and I went there Friday 02/17/17, we ordered a total of 6 sandwiches and some soup. Staff was very friendly, efficient and helpful. The food was very tasty, the sandwiches were immense yet well built and easy to eat. Meaning, the sandwiches did not slide apart while we ate them, always a bonus. Yeah, we will eat there again. I had the Coney isle Ruben on pumpernickel, it was great. most others got Hells Kitchens and chicken salad. I'll certainly try the HK next time. It was very well received by the people the ordered it."}
{"text":"The best Egg Salad Sandwich ever!!!  (Hell's Kitchen)

Keep in mind, that is the only thing I have ever had from there, so I do not know about their other sandwiches (although, my friend loves their BLT, and my husband loved the Bronx Bomber).

I get the Hell's Kitchen on Sourdough.  It is Egg Salad with avocado and this cajun sauce with bacon (I also add onion).  mmmmm.. I crave this sandwich ALL the time.

Cookies are OK, macaroni salad is decent, but the Hell's Kitchen is the best part and the reason I am giving it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Really great place! Staff is very friendly! and work hard! It's my main choice for lunch. The bread is really something, along with the Cajun sauce \"YUM!\" Their \"Hell's Kitchen\" is to die for. They are expensive but it's worth it because the quality is out of this world! Great ingredients and secret recipes. 

I eat a lot of Heidi's and I can say their service and food is consistent which is uncommon but a real treat!"}
{"text":"I've gone here for lunch a few times, since it's close to my office.  The food is decent, not really a Brooklyn Deli, but good sandwiches.  This week I went again, and the level of service was horrible.  

The line when I arrived was around 15 people.  Half the staff was not servicing the line, and a couple others appeared to be just wondering around, not doing anything.  When I finally got to the counter after 15 minutes of waiting,  instead of them making my sandwich, a different employee started arguing with them about how they had screwed up previous orders.  So they argued about this for a while before one of them stoppe makingthe sandwich he was making to remake others, all while the counter was full of people waiting to eat.  

When I finally got my sandwich I had to wait in another large line to pay.  They had one person working the cash register, and he was clearly overwhealmed and confused.  They did not have anyone try to come help him.  I was finally able to pay and get my lunch, in all it took 30 minutes to get a sandwich made.  

I emailed the manager to let him know about the experience, he made some excuses, didn't seem to care about his employees taking a half hour to make a sandwich.  

I think there used to be a different manager there who always worked the register, and things ran smoothly, but the last couple times he has not been there."}
{"text":"On a friend's recommendation, I stopped in to grab breakfast on my way to hike the Towpath Trail. As I approached the front door, I saw the sign out front advertising \"Susie's Breakfast Burrito!\" As a sucker for all breakfast foods in wrap-form, I walked in, took a gander at the menu to see what I would be getting in my sweet bundle of breakfasty goodness. 

Susie's Breakfast Burrito contains the following: scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, or sausage, potatoes, green chili, wrapped in a flour tortilla. Sounds great! 

The deli-man was really nice as I placed my order: \"1 breakfast burrito, no meat, (I went meatless on Mondays for a year on a dare. Stupid idea.) and extra potatoes, please!\" 

What followed was straight out of Monty Python's \"Cheese Shop\" skit. 

Deli-man: \"Just so you know...we don't have any green chili today.\" 
Me: \"Not a problem. Just egg, cheese and extra potatoes will be great.\" 
Deli-man: \"Um, yah...just so you know....we're also out of potatoes.\" 
Me: (somewhat confused) \"OK...how about egg and cheese with avocado and tomato in a tortilla?\" 
Deli-man: \"Um...we're out of tortillas.\" 
Me: \"Ah! Egg and cheese croissant, please.\" 

The sandwich was good. The croissant was lightly toasted, buttery and flaky, as it should be, and the eggs were tasty. 

I'll give Heidi's another try. Hopefully Michael Palin and John Cleese won't be behind the counter. Or if they are, I hope it's \"The Spanish Inquisition.\" NOOOOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly but the food was on par with what you'd buy at a QuikTrip gas station - for twice the price. Save yourself some money and travel: Make yourself a sandwich at home. You'll get a better sandwich."}
{"text":"Best Reuben I have ever had with so much meat and sauerkraut I couldn't finish it.
Not bad for the price."}
{"text":"Since it's just become typical everywhere here in the valley, I quit complaining about prices here in town yrs ago- but if I hadn't.....  this is a very ordinary place selling pretty much very ordinary food. Their cajun turkey's probably the exception, it stands out."}
{"text":"I went for the first time after seeing a movie at Cinemark at Valley View, and was impressed with the ingredients on the deli menu -- lox, avocado, et cetera.  My mother and grandmother had recently raved about the hot corned beef sandwich and cole slaw they had had there.  I ordered the \"Awesome\" Salad, with fresh mozzarella, avocado, tomatoes, and onions.  The lady behind the counter was very nice and chatty while preparing my food, but I began to notice that she was using sad-looking iceberg greens (which I think are a sorry excuse for a salad green, anyway) to pad the lack of mozzarella and avocado in the salad.  Knowing it wouldn't keep me full for long, I added an order of the Brooklyn Veggie Wrap (hummus, cream cheese, avocado, lettuce,  tomato, and onion).  The wrap was average; the salad was sub-par.  I was very disappointed; with all those great ingredients, I could have prepared everything much better at home."}
{"text":"i have to agree with benjamin p. i used to go there alot but always felt like i was bothering them with my business..havent been back in a while..i felt like a sandwich today and was gonna give it another try til i read the most recent reviews..i guess i will go somewhere else...."}
{"text":"When I think of a \"Brooklyn\" Deli, I think of a New York Deli with stacks of meat on a sandwich, Jewish Rye Bread, and Menu that goes along with it. Contrary to some other Reviews about the portions/meat being large/huge don't be fooled, not here. Besides being disappointed by the Business Name not being associated with the Dining Experience, I encountered Processed Meat on Regular Sandwich Bread that they called \"Rye\". So, if you're longing for an Actual New York Type Deli, this isn't the place for either of us. I did give it \"1-Star\" for two reasons: 1) That's the lowest rating possible by Yelp, and 2) I did get a Smoothie (that's found at every New York Deli in the world :) ) that was actually HUGE and worth the Price. Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and nice staff. The bread was thick and delicious, which was my favorite part about the sandwiches. Overall great deli"}
{"text":"Tasty bread as it is baked fresh daily.  Their chocolate chip cookie is also very good.  The workers seem to be a lacking a bit in the service department but overall, the food is good."}
{"text":"Very dissapointed. I ordered the Cajun turkey with avocado,  On sourdough bread. I told the guy to put the sauce on the side and he forgot and put it on my sandwich. 
 I had to have him remake it.The bread was so thick and doughy I could hardly bite into it. There was no salt and pepper on  it at all. very very bland. Paid extra for cheese. I  asked for the side of the potato salad., which comes in a tiny container. It was sour tasting so I had to send it back.I ended up with a bag of chips. I also ordered a bowl of potato bacon soup, which I found out they have shipped in. It was watery and bland, no seasoning.  potatos tasted like rubber. Overpriced. Reminded me of a subway. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Discovered this place a few years ago and have been going ever since. Everything is delicious, great price, great service."}
{"text":"Just had Lunch here today. The Corned Beef here is really good. Give it a try. The customer service is great as well."}
{"text":"FOOD= Great
STAFF= Friendly
PRICE=$$


Delicious sandwiches here try the eggplant on pumpernickel its amazing! Staff is always friendly and doesn't rush you. Anytime I am around the area, I grab lunch here for my family."}
{"text":"Hot sandwich was cold. Rude staff. Paid $9 for thick cut bread and a spoon of potato salad."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best sandwiches I have had, yea sometimes there are lines BUT the Hells Kitchen sandwich is amazing. I have also tried the Ruben which is good too as well as the crab cake sandwich. I highly recommend this place, the staff is nice, the food is great and the place is chill but respectable."}
{"text":"The worst deli by far I would not recommend any buddy come here the service is terrible the serving size is terrible the management is on friendly just very immature workers the employees don't know how to make a sandwich and I would never refer anybody the worst deli by far in the Phoenix area"}
{"text":"I love this place there hell's kitchen is awesom and they have a lunch special.  Its amazing try it...totally worth it"}
{"text":"I got the philly cheese steak.  The bread was decent, but that was about all that was decent.   The steak was roast beef heated up.  The bell peppers were mushy and there was hardly any flavor to the sandwich.  I would much rather have gone to subway.  I would not go back again."}
{"text":"I'm upgrading my review because they have many vegetarian options, I  have more become somewhat of a regular here, and everything is all incredibly fantastic! The bread and soups are all amazing. Definitely try the eggplant parmesan.."}
{"text":"I really feel bad about this but... I Ordered chicken parmesan to eat in. First soda machine was out of co2 ok no biggie. Second sandwich was still cold, third horrible potato salad zero flavor at all & little watery. Everything was so bland and \"meh\" I have no reason to come back. I could get this anywhere. I suggest hot chicken parmesans, with some kind of flavor as well as for the potato salad. Should have went to the gyro place I was going to go to in the same parking lot or go one block up to chompies in the arrowhead mall."}
{"text":"Very good service and very good food. I was ordering food for my mom, sister, and I. I ordered two chicken and rice bread bowls, a chef salad, and a caprese sandwich. All we very good. Customer service was awesome which can be hard to find now in days."}
{"text":"The Hells Kitchen Egg Salad sandwich is probably the best I've ever had. Gotta try this again... and I'm not even a big sandwich fan. :)"}
{"text":"A saw this place after leaving a terrible meal at the musclemaker grill across the parking lot.  I said next time I would eat here and I am glad I did.  Very tasty big sandwiches.  We enjoyed our food very much.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Good food, ok service, great lunch special! Best $5 lunch in the area.

Yesterday I had the French dip on the hoagie, with onions, peppers, and provolone. All the bread is made in house and is AMAZING! The Hell's kitchen sauce is to die for. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Run of the mill sandwich shop, with the exception of the bread, which is homemade everyday.  I ordered the Chicken Parm with no frills on an Italian hoagie roll and a side of cole slaw and banana peppers.

The chicken, sauce, and cheese were nothing special.  All seemed to have been pre-made, not exactly what you would expect from a \"Brooklyn Deli\".  The bread was the best part, and the portion was a good bang for the buck.

The coleslaw was average, and came in a ketchup takeout ramekin, disproportionate to the sandwich for sure.  Banana peppers were jarred, no surprises there.

The expectations and quality of a Brooklyn deli weren't up to snuff, but would give it another try for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and there's always a good radio station playing in the background.  I've been going to this Heidi's for over a year now, typically once a week on an office run for me and three other guys.  I haven't had a sandwich from their menu that wasn't good, and all of the sides are always a good option.  $5 lunch for half a sandwich (just as big as a whole sandwich you'd make at home), a side (chips, macaroni salad, potato salad, or cole slaw), a chocolate chip cookie and a drink is a steal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich place. Honestly, I don't even like sandwiches. They have a Hell's Kitchen that is amazing. Sometimes I eat there twice a week! Their bread is fresh and brownies are amazing. Kevin always gives me amazing customer service and the best sandwiches. You should really give it a try. Five stars in my books."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Deli's in the valley! They bake their bread fresh everyday and it smells soooooo good!! I always get the BLT with avocado on marble rye and a cup of soup! So Delicious! They also have smoothies which are made with fresh fruit and are so delicious! I will always tell my friends and family about this place!!"}
{"text":"alright I loooove heidi's BUT the service at this location suuuuuuuucks. I went during lunch time and it was really busy so I understand that the guys working there are moving fast on orders however the guy that made mine just completely sucked. he was really sweaty haha...I asked for a turkey and he said \"tuna?\" and I corrected him and said no I want turkey...what did I get? I got tuna haha. It was still good but it's not what I wanted. and before I even had the chance to correct what he made me he already called the next customer over...I didn't even have a real chance to walk away. but ehhhh whatever the sandwich was still good and I don't want to be that one bitch who holds everyone up so I didn't make a deal out of it especially since the place was packed."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place, now ive went about 3 or 4 times and i look forward to going to lunch. The crab cake sandwich was pretty good but the Hell's Kitchen sandwich is amazing. Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Great old school style sandwich shop. Traditional sandwich menu with a few uncommon gems. I recommend the Ruben. Fresh ingredients, fresh bread and a large menu including soups and Nathan's brand hot dogs. Heidi's also offers real fruit smoothies made to order with fresh fruit. They are very tasty but beware they are a meal in themselves, possibly a good meal substitute for someone on a diet. The store front and bathrooms are always clean and orderly with little to complain about. To sum up, very comparable in price to the major fast food chains but with quality that far exceeds what the \"big guys\" provide. My go to sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Pretty good pastrami sandwich!  Stopped by for lunch, it was pretty busy so you might want to call in your order ahead of time!"}
{"text":"BLT with avocado, OMG I'm salivating as I type this! Sooooo good from Heidi's! Also the Coney Island Reuben is super tasty. I love places that give you a free pickle with your sandwich. Just makes me smile and reminds me of sandwiches at home made by mom. Always with a pickle. 

I really wish they had a Heidi's in the southwest by my house because I would go more often and get to try more menu items. Or....maybe not. Cause I'd probably just stick to my two faves and have to buy a new wardrobe because of my expanding waist. Yeah, probably better that it's not close to home :)

Highly recommended for lunch if you are in the area. :)"}
{"text":"This place is expensive! $7.00 for a 6\" sandwich. Or the scam of a lunch special. You get a dinky 2 and a half inch sandwich and chips that cost extra with a small drink for $7.29. 
I decided to order the cheesesteak sandwich. The lady first cut my huge piece of bread and placed the ingredients in it. To make it hot she microwaved the poor thing for 1 minute on super power. In fact when she took it out of the nuclear machine it burned her hand. Once the radiated thing they call a sandwich was ready to eat the bread had that just microwaved hardness to it. Bottom line this place is not good on you pocket book or your taste buds. 
The only good thing about this crap place is it is close to Subway and Raberto's."}
{"text":"My brother and I have been branching out to find new lunch options. Heidi's Brooklyn Deli has been a pleasant surprise. I'm hooked on the Cajun turkey with avocado. I've had it on sourdough and marble rye, but I prefer the latter. The sourdough was too dense and dry. When I saw Cajun Turkey on the menu I expected seasoned turkey breast, but it is only roasted. The Cajun comes from the mayo spread. It has a nice kick and combined with the cool creamy mashed avocado it's the perfect match. Crisp lettuce, sliced purple onion and tomato makes it complete. The lunch special is $5 for half a sandwich with a pickle, chips, potato or macaroni salad and a cookie. However, I prefer the full sandwich with pickle, chips, potato or macaroni salad for a buck more. My brother has taken a liking to the chicken salad. One of these days, I'll have to try something else on the menu, but until then I'll happily enjoy the Cajun Turkey."}
{"text":"Sandwich lovers, prepare to feast. This joint has plenty to choose from in that department, and even throws in a few salads, hot dogs and soups to enjoy too. 

I think the sandwiches here are good, but I think what keeps the crowds coming back are the lunch specials. Half a sandwich, a side and a drink for $5 is tough to beat. Even a whole sandwich at $6.99 is fair. There are all kinds of other combos too, salad and soup, soup and sandwich, it goes on and on. The sandwiches are a good size, even the half would be mistaken for a whole by most people. I've enjoyed the mozzarella and tomato, a few of the turkey options and the BLT with avocado. All tasty but what really impressed me on my last visit was the Italian bread. It was still warm!!! Major points. Their wheat and such is fine, but this was the best way to have a sandwich I think. So glad I blurted out Italian. That's the other thing with this place...cut the small talk in line and start reading because when it's your turn to order you better be ready. It's an assembly line of efficiency and I am almost always caught off guard and stumble through my order. 

I'm from NY and this is still no NY deli, but they're trying and it works for me."}
{"text":"Man o man, I eat here for lunch 2-3 days per week and totally spaced in actually writing a review. Anyways, here goes. 
They have filling sandwiches, soups, salads, and smoothies. I've tried the majority of the sandwiches and my favorites are the bronx bomber which is egg salad with pastrami, and the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Tried Heidi's for the first time and loved it. I got the Sausage with peepers and onions with no marinara sauce. I got it with a hoagie bread. They must be known for their bread because every sandwich had homemade bread. It was very tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered the philly cheese steak sandwich!  Such a lifeless sandwich.  The food preparer took a square piece of brown meat cut it up and than heated it up in an oven.   It tasted like crap.  The bill was 11.43$. What a crime!!  I think the sandwich is like 8 inches long by 2 inches wide.  Overpriced and made with pre fab meat!!! What a joke!  You get a dillpickle and your choice of potato salad, macaroni salad, cole slaw that comes in a round container that is tiny like they look like they're in prison or chips.  I opted for the chips.  Don't waste your time coming here.  This place will be out of business soon.  Overpriced with no quality of deliciousness in sight!  I don't mind paying more if it's worth it!  What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"What a great sandwich, actually tastes like a New York Deli. Good variety with awesome potato salad and generous meats in sandwich."}
{"text":"Best lunch deal in town!!! Half Sandwich (largest half sandwich I've seen), potato salad (handmade), choc chip cookie, pickle and a refillable drink all for $5... This meal could easily be priced at 8 bucks and they wouldn't lose business. The choice of fresh baked breads and menu items are numerous. A different meal for each work day of the month and then some."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now, and still am not impressed.  The prices are definitely Brooklyn, but there's not a lot going on there as far as quality meats, breads, or sides.  The tortilla soup I had was one of the worst I have ever tried.  Not on my list of places I would go back to.  DiBellas opening up across the street could spell disaster for this place unless they pick up the ball."}
{"text":"I just want to say that after multiple visits to Heidi's, it's been consistently good. Their bread is really, REALLY great. I've had sourdough, pumpernickel, and rye, and it's got a soft, doughy texture, almost like a (really well-made) bagel. 

Also, the woman who works there is so nice! She always asks about my family when I go in. Yesterday, it was pouring, and I ordered a lot of food to go. She said I should bring my car around (since I also had the baby) and she ran out to put the box into my car. Really thoughtful!

Finally: their chocolate cake is the bomb. I think they put almond extract in it or something. It's really top-notch, for those who love sweet fudge cake like I do."}
{"text":"I used to be a frequent customer at Heidi's, about twice a week.. over the last five years my visits have decreased to maybe once a month. After today, I will no longer return. Their customer service has diminished terribly, the sandwiches are decent, but for $8 I can go to many other places. 
My favorites are the Cajun Avocado Turkey and the Chicken Salad Sandwich. Today, I drove 15 minutes  (20 with the horrible construction traffic on Sunset) to get a chicken salad sandwich for lunch. I ordered my usual, paid, and drove back to work. Once I got to work I opened my sandwich and saw I had received a plain turkey sandwich. wth! I did not drive all the way over there for a turkey sandwich. I called, the guy on the phone was immediately rude when I told him they had given me the wrong sandwich. He said \"bring it back then!\"..  I told him I was at work and I could not drive back over, would not be able to go back that way until Monday. His response \"well bring it back then\"..  How the hell am I going to hold on to a sandwich for 3 days just so that I can take it back to them?? I asked for his name and he did not respond, I asked again and he said \"Bob\". Bob, that was the the most ignorant response I've ever heard to help rectify an issue with an order that you guys screwed up! 

I've tried several other sandwiches and soups from here, but none of them are worth a return visit. Aside from the horrible service, it's annoying that they call this a \"Brooklyn Deli\".  This is a very poor representation of a Brooklyn deli!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for about a year now, and its really, really good every time.  The Hell's Kitchen Sandwich - egg salad, bacon, swiss & avacodo on marble rye is to die for.  One star deduction because the side portion (chips or potato salad) is really, really small, like 1/4 cup small.  Teeny.  The sandwiches however are decent sized.  Other recommended sandwiches:  Bronx Bomber - egg salad and pastrami on rye (yes I love egg salad!), Coney Island Reuben and the Cajun Crab Cake.  All outstanding. 

I am also ecstatic to find that they don't use latex gloves when making the sandwiches, unlike many sandwich chains.  My son is deathly allergic to latex. 

This is not a mom and pop though, its a national chain.  Its just relatively new to Vegas.  But who cares, its great!"}
{"text":"Heidi's is as good as any NY deli !!!

The best pastrami and Swiss I have ever had. 

They make all of their bread fresh on site."}
{"text":"This place was delicious for sandwiches. Their bread is amazing. I rated it a 4 stars because it depends who you get that makes your sandwich lol. Sandwiches are great size and we eat there a lot. I usually get the turkey white.  Can't go wrong. Delish!!! Can't go wrong if you're looking for a good sandwich place."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are to die for, the prices are great and the staff are super friendly. From pastrami to corned beef to prime rib sandwiches and tasty wraps, to fresh salads and healthy smoothies, to mouth-watering cheesecake and other delectable desserts, you'll want to keep coming back to try something new. 

They only use the best ingredients between their freshly baked breads. You can choose from Ciabatta, Pumpernickel, Italian, Sourdough, white, wheat and many more."}
{"text":"I love this place more than words. I now work far away and it makes me sad. The French Dip is my go to sandwich. My hubby changes it up. The people are so friendly and nice. Its not the cheapest place to grab a bite, but really, cheap food = cheap food. I'd rater pay a couple extra bucks for good quality. And the sandwiches are so big, I eat it in 2 sittings!"}
{"text":"Please take the name Brooklyn from your name. I find this a disgrace to Brooklyn. This is not a real deli. Not by my NY standards. 
My coleslaw tasted like fish. My Reuben was soggy. It was not real rye bread. My boyfriends salad was warm. He could not eat it. And too pricey for this kind of food. I will not be heading back."}
{"text":"I've only tried this place once, but I already know the next time I go, I will have the same experience. They have $5 specials and they give you a pretty nice serving. I bought the Cajun Crab Cake on rye and LOVED IT. The cookie that came with my meal was delicious. I love this place and you have to try it if you get a chance. I am going back there today and will post an update"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm about to give you all the inside scoop of this place. I quit about a year ago so sorry if anything has changed. 

Heidi's brooklyn deli..... let me speak straight to you vicki ( the owner) the reason why all these people say employees are rude or that you guys have bad service is because you treat your employees like you don't give two F***s about them. I have never even seen you AND I WORKED THERE.. The only thing I enjoyed was my free half sandwich, at least you have something to hold your employees down. Not only that but your other employees are incompetent and disrespectful.(Except Petra shes super nice) No one looks happy because they hate working there!!! And just so all us customers know, we do bother them when we walk through that door. When they see your car pulling up, believe me they are cussing up a storm right until your finger tips touch the door. I came in not too long ago around 630 ish and the 3 employees were behind the counter already, I ordered my fav. Sammy and the taller white female was incredibly rude to me the whole time. sorry I actually made you work.. I went home and lost my appetite from all the anger. 

As for the food you are one stingy business owner.. and from experience to everyone who hasn't been able to make there own sandwich here, your missing out. These sandwiches have so much potential if they just let us put the right amount of meat on it ..and if we didn't use microwaves. The sandwiches a paying customer gets is so far from what an employee gets. And it's free. I remember trying to cover how much bacon to put on the sandwich because I just felt straight bad putting what 4 strands?  The prices are ridiculous. 

The place is filthy, not by just skimming but if you really look it's disgusting. I'm surprised you guys haven't been shut down by the health inspectors. 

The one star is for the bread and cajun sauce. 

Dear Vicki, I hope you stopped treating your employees like shit. Sincerely, your former pissed off employee."}
{"text":"Bad service- rude and unhelpful.  
dirty - I saw a guy pick up the floor mats and clean them and never washed his hands. 
 The food was horrible. Never again."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, amazing food, awesome service, and really clean deli, diffently coming back again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"great corned beef & coleslaw, better yet bread is freshly made on premises. now all this is a perfect 5 star. where can u find better maybe Chicago or Brooklyn. or another heidis. please put one in sun city az.  ."}
{"text":"Yay for local mom and pop deli's. I enjoy nothing more than a hearty sandwich, with soup and salad. This place is a great addition to Charleston Blvd.
They used to have pies, but that didn't sell too well, so it's just down to the bread and butter of making the items aforementioned.
The lunch special is pretty good 5-6 bucks for half a sandwhich, chips and drink..
I got the half sandwich with soup deal. I enjoyed it very much, left full , but felt satisfied.
Note: W Sahara location closed and moved here"}
{"text":"Get there early during lunchtime. wish they had a wider selection of sides r even chips . but on several occasions ive enjoyed the philly sandwich and some others have enjoyed masterpieces such as a chicken parmesan sandwich & the hells kitchen"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place other than it was clean, service was okay, and the sandwiches are good... but really... what more do you want from a deli?"}
{"text":"Went to this deli yeasterday with my boy friend and well not worth what we paid. I got a ham and cheese sandswich and he got the Italian. First let me say the meat they use I can buy pre-package at any store. When I think Deli I'm expecting something like Boars Head or better. It was far from it. But will say the bread was great. Sides are super small and the smoothies taste watered down."}
{"text":"By far the best deli in town!! They have the best deals!!! You can get a half sandwich your choice of side of potato chips,cole slaw or potato,pickle,cookie and medium drink for $5. I recommend stopping by before or after the 12pm lunch rush because the place gets really packed and on some days they can sell out by 3pm."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the Hell's Kitchen and my husband got the Coney Island Reuben with corned beef. Best egg salad I've ever had! Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich shops, sourdough bread is the best ever! The Hell's Kitchen and the Bronx bomber and my favorite, soups are really good too. You can buy a loaf of their bread if you pre order or after lunch. I wish they were opened later and on Sundays. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I live within a mile of Heidi's and have been coming her regularly for several years. I have never been disappointed with the food. Everything I've tried has been great. The restaurant is typically clean and I usually have good service."}
{"text":"Their Buttertop white bread is the best bread I have ever sunk my teeth into. Fresh baked bread and a taste that makes you go straighback to your childhood. When you have delicious bread on a great sandwich... it's a mouthwatering combo. I always get the Cajun turkey avocado and feel comfortable saying it's my favorite sandwich ... ever. I have had bagels here, very tasty, but a too \"bready\" for my bagel preference.. if you like a fluffy bready bagel these would be perfect for you. Cajun turkey! Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Speed is not their specialty but their sandwiches are! 

Amazing white bread, great sandwich choices, and really delicious potato salad. 

Could definitely work on customer service and speed (talking 20 mins with only one person in front of us) but the food is worth the slow and rude service."}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from my office but I always forget it's there. Not sure why, I've liked everything I've eaten there.

Love the fresh baked bread. It's soft and delicious. They do tend to cut it a little thick but ask, and they will cut it thinner.

Meats are good quality and tasty. Especially love the corned beef. I know other reviewers have commented that it's not a New York deli. They're right. But this ain't New York! For a desert deli, this is pretty darned good.

My only complaint is the sides are pretty skimpy. Tasty, but 2 bites doesn't cut it. So, one star off for that.

Staff is always friendly and helpful. Often a line but it moves fast. Overall, a good lunch choice."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this Deli! They have daily specials if you're looking for a pretty inexpensive meal. A must-try is they're fresh smoothies, they are to die for."}
{"text":"So... The food is awesome but BRING CASH ONLY!!! I have been eating here for years and everything was copasetic until a month ago when I bought a sammich and brownie and the next thing you know, I'm suddenly trying to spend $485 at Wal Mart, buying gas in Boston, Philly, and going to the Home depot in Pittsburgh... all from the comfort of my recliner in Buckeye, AZ! So of course I'm bitching about this at work (right down the street from Heidi's) and 3 of my coworkers who all went there for lunch on the same day had the same thing happen to them! Not a huge fan of debit card fraud, but the cajun turkey sammich is pretty tasty... So, if youre feeling lucky, I recommend Heidi's Brooklyn Deli!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today with DH, should have kept driving.  Two good points: great service and fresh sandwich fillings. Now for the bad...

I got a \"relocated new Yorker\" on a hoagie, and the hoagie bun destroyed it. The bread was split into two pieces, so the tops kept falling off of the halves (ever hear of toothpicks, Heidi? I seriously recommend them). The plates were heavy, but I managed to not drop one on my way to a table. The bun tops, however, kept falling off and one hit the floor. The guys behind the counter were awesome, and they replaced that one. The sandwich ingredients were good, but that dry bread was a jaw breaker and ruined the meal(plus I was being buried in poppy seeds falling off the bun. 

The Cole slaw was \"meh\", no taste. The potato salad was good, if a bit salty. The soda machine needed a new Coke tank but apparently it wasn't tapped enough for them to care (and yes, they knew - an employee was right next to me waiting to get his own drink refill while it sputtered noisily into my cup. Add the lack of salt and pepper shakers, having to fetch napkins from another table (really? Did those dispensers suddenly get too pricey for each table to have one?), and a ceiling fan on so fast that we had to weight down napkins to keep them from flying away, and there just isn't enough left to get me to return. Two sandwiches, two fountain drinks, plus tip = $25 that I will be spending elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"It does make much sense that one who is wagging a personal battle against wheat flour would be dinning in a deli for lunch but the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.

HBD was super friendly and made my \"Hells Kitchen\" egg salad sandwich on lettuce without being the slightest bit judgmental."}
{"text":"I love this deli and lucky for me, it's right around the corner!

Everything I have ever ordered has been fresh and delicious and comes with a smile from the friendly staff. I highly recommend the Pastrami and no matter which bread you choose, it's all made in house and is incredible!"}
{"text":"The team members were pleasant. My 13 yr old son swears that the Hells Kitchen on marbled rye is THEE greatest sandwich he will ever eat! The Cajun sauce is a little much for me, but the Cajun Turkey with avocado is delicious. My husband always gets the Italian and eats the whole thing!!! I don't recommend any of the soups, they are never hot enough, even after they warm them up."}
{"text":"Heidi's was officially closed when I stopped in for lunch today.  Too bad, because their $6.00 lunch special was a great deal!"}
{"text":"The value here has declined. They discontinued the lunch specials. I ordered a half veggie sandwich which came with a side and a pickle and I purchased a fountain drink to go and this was $8.27. The bread didn't seem very fresh and it was the end piece."}
{"text":"Woke up late but could not decide where to eat.  My and the GF decided to try the \"Concierge\" feature on the Yelp site.  Within a couple of clicks it brought us to HBD.

Located in a tiny strip male with a 7-11 and rental car nearby the parking was a bit of a challenge. My recommendation is to park either North or South.

Upon walking in we were greeted by a nice lady behind the counter.  I was instantly overwhelmed by the menu and so I started asking for recommendations.  The lady recommended the \"Hell's Kitchen ($7.99).\"  This yummy little sandwich consists of egg salad, bacon, swiss, avocado ( but I dot remember mine having any) and a spicy cajun sauce.  I chose to have it on sourdough. 

The GF had half a turkey wrap and I was taken back by it's freshness.  In addition, she also ordered up some tortilla soup.  It's was not and delicious.

There are lot's of choices and I look forward to coming back and trying some more."}
{"text":"First time at Heidi's.  My pops and I went to lunch, and he wanted Heidi's.  He used to go quite often, and enjoys their sandwiches.

I ordered the Fresh Mozzarella with tomatoes, pesto, and balsamic on ciabatta sandwich bread.  Very nice and light!  All sandwiches come with a pickle and your choice of cole slaw, potato salad, or macaroni salad.  I opted for the macaroni salad, but the mayo was too sweet for my taste.  I tried my Dad's cole slaw and that was pretty good.

My Dad ordered half a sandwich - I'll probably do that next time because I couldn't finish the whole thing.  I wrapped it up and took it with me.

Looking forward to trying the proscuitto...

Dum vivimus, vivamus!

{"text":"A tree grows in Peoria, uh I mean Brooklyn.  A Brooklyn deli settled in Peoria of all places?  WTF is that all about?   

It's savvy business sense is what it is.  This corner of the Valley is starved for a New York / Italian deli - and from the throng of a lunch-time crowd I think my hunch is right.  This Denver-based deli is new to town, but is taking the Arrowhead area and this Golds Gym strip mall by storm.  If you get there between 12-1 you're looking at a wait about 10 people deep. 

NERD-ALERT ADVERTISING ASIDE
You might recall the two-stage clever billboard campaign about a year ago with with a UPS packaged look to it simply messaged with the words \"Something is coming from Brooklyn.\" A ripped corner on the billboard a few weeks later revealed the logo and location.  Ok now, back to the review.

I had heard about the bread here, but didn't take those comments too seriously.  I swear to God.  I have never seen bread so huge, fluffy and decadent.  These freshly-baked loaves sit at the counter taunting would-be customers with their beauty and scrumptiousness.   The marble rye roll was as big as my face.  The sourdough, wheat and white slices must be an INCH AND A HALF THICK!  You walk up to the counter, place your order with your own sandwich maker - which Heidi's has at about 10 staff members deep!

The sandwich selections are typical of New York or Italian delis and the feel of the place with its clubby dark wood booth atmosphere there evokes Brooklyn alright.  I've had the Transplanted New Yorker and Cajun Turkey Avocados sandwiches.   The TNY comes with five Italian meats, provolone and a spicy chipotle aioli.  Holy crap was that sauce HOT.  I mean, I like my food spicy, but I got a big wad of that in one bite, and WOWEE it made me wince a bit.  Another more popular sandwich there (which I want to try next time) is Hells Kitchen - which silly me, I thought was a trendy Manhattan nabe.  The HK is egg salad, bacon, swiss, avocado and the spicy sauce.   Sounds weirdly decadent yet tasty all at once.  The best named item would have to be the \"Make Your Own, But Don't Be a Pain in the Ass\" Wrap - a more clever way to put it, eh?

If you're a Nathan's Famous hot dog fan, you can get your fix for that here too.   They don't mess around when it comes to portions - with meats on the heavy side.  But at $7 each the sandwiches aren't cheap either.   So you get what you pay for here.   The desserts are similarly fresh-baked, huge and delicious -- having had both the 5-inch square brownies and cookies.  I spied a delicious cannoli here, so keep that in mind too. 

After $9 and change you've got yourself some good deli grub, and probably might consider yourself a newly devout fan -- like I do.

Yes folks.  A tree grows in Brooklyn.  And a Brooklyn deli now grows in Peoria.

P.S. Biltmore and Downtown locations are opening later this year."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches around. Hell's Kitchen is a must. Fresh bread is baked daily in house. Chicken parmigiana sandwich is also great. Price is affordable and potato salad is amazing."}
{"text":"The $5 lunch deal is a lot of awesome food - why would anyone go to the Subway next door?  Because of the popularity of the lunch deal, they're usually super busy during lunch hours.  No matter how long you have to wait though, you'll always get friendly service.

All of their breads are freshly made and you can't go wrong with any of them.  I've tried the wheat, ciabatta and sour dough and they're all really good.

My co-workers and I go there about once a week and we all love the Hell's Kitchen, Chicken Salad, Tuna Salad and of course the Turkey sandwiches, so I'd definitely recommend any of those."}
{"text":"The $5 special turn out to be $6.48. I felt cheated and there was no explanation. The mozzarella  sandwich which I had was not good at all. After the meal, I decided to go to Einsteins."}
{"text":"Stellar deli- wish I'd checked the reviews here before going, because I would have ordered differently. That being said, I still enjoyed everything I did get!

BF and I worked hard moving into our new apartment and worked up an appetite- rushed to Heidi's for sustenance. We each got a sandwich and swapped halves to share: the Transplanted New Yorker on marble rye was his choice while the Salmon Melt on french was mine. Both came with pickles and cups of potato salad. 
I'm not a big spice fan but the NY was a good kind of spicy- it snuck up on you! Each bite started out mild and built up in eat for a spicy aftertaste. Bread was soft, meat was plentiful, and the avocado was a nice creamy touch.
The Salmon Melt was delish- I'm picky about warm salmon (I prefer it as sashimi) but the flavors were spot on. Add in the spicy cajun sauce and it had a good kick to it that added the much-needed \"extra something\" that a lot of salmon sandwiches lack.

The pickle was a great bit of cool flavor after the spicy sandwiches, and the potato salad was with red potatoes- which is so much better than regular mustard/mayo potato salad. Red potatoes make the salad so much better, no clue why. Maybe it's all in my head.

In any case, the sandwiches are effing huge- the half sandwich lunch combo would be a perfect meal, but with the half-and-half swap the BF and I did, neither of us completely finished. Which is a good thing. I could only manage about 3/4ths of each and it's the only meal I ate for the day. 
The meal for both of us, with tax, came to a total of $20- awesome pricing for phenomenal portion sizes, great value.

Also worth a mention? The staff is badass. Super friendly and polite, cool guys. Had recommendations and suggestions, and even offered to make a half pastrami and half corned beef sandwich for the BF in the future. We'll definitely be back- the breakfast burrito, crab cake, and eggplant parm all need to be in my life. As do the soups!"}
{"text":"Will never eat here again. Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced. On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was. Horrible first time experience!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Heidi's for nearly three years. After many good years and despite no major change in ownership, staff or menu, I've found myself avoiding the restaurant. 

Their restrictive hours (they close at 3pm) limit my experiences to weekend lunches only. I live about 7 miles away, so it is a minor trek to get there and why that is no fault of theirs, I always leave hoping the food makes up for the lousy attitudes by the majority of sandwich makers. The same crew of about 5 or 6 have been there for that entire stretch. I never feel welcomed and often feel like I am inconveniencing them to make my sandwich. The only friendly face is the older gentleman. 

Despite the service, I had been going regularly as the food was usually pretty good. I've tried nearly half the menu, love the soups and before they stopped serving them, was a big fan of their smoothies. Recently, their food has been subpar. A combo of sloppily made sandwiches and dry bread have forced me to look elsewhere. Perhaps I'll give them a try again in the future."}
{"text":"I have to say that based on some of the other reviews, I think I went at the right time of day and they did get my order right, yeaaa!  

I ordered the corned beef sandwich on marble rye bread and it was pretty decent, 
I must say.  I enjoyed it.  

I DO HAVE TO SAY THOUGH, that my bread was thicker and meatier than the corned beef between it.  I guess they wanted me to have plenty of room to taste the bread by itself without any meat getting in the way.  And I ASSURE YOU, the meat stayed clear the hell out of the way.  Each slice of bread was 1 inch thick, so I was literally eating through 2 inches of bread, seriously (I actually pulled my ruler out of my desk and measured it, I know it sounds anal :( but I'm just saying)).. I'm still hungry, that's what I'm saying.

All in all, the sandwich was good and so far it is the best I have found here in LV, but I am still searching.  Nothing like the corned beef from Lou's Deli in Detroit, MI, but still good and I will return when I am not as hungry as I was today. Maybe next time I will ask for some butter so I can appropiately say I had half a sandwich and a thick slice of bread and butter for my meal.  :)"}
{"text":"New owner has run this place into the ground.    I usually go about three times a week and the last three times I have been the place is a mess, seats are torn and the food quality has drastically declined.   They used to make fresh bread, but the bread on the sandwich was stale.  sadly I will not be going back."}
{"text":"First time and the last time I will go to this place. Their turkey and meatball subs were a huge disappointment that cost me a total of about $15. The meatball sub was very bland and did not have any flavor. This place is just overpriced for what you get. You have to pay extra to get cheese on the turkey sub, which is a joke. Overall, I would have been happier going to subway for their cheap Jared the child molester subs."}
{"text":"Great sandwich, fresh vegetables and very friendly staff. Would recommend anyone who wants a quick lunch in a clean calm environment to come here"}
{"text":"Food was good and delivered to our table in a timely fashion.

Noise level can be a little high during lunch since the floors are hard surface."}
{"text":"Food is good if you like to be charged TWICE!!

I work nearby and my coworkers recommended this location. I went a couple times and the amounts being charged to my account were more as compared to my receipt. Before noticing this issue; I found another. I made a CASH purchase for $13.31. and a card purchase of $3.27 and then found both transactions on my card history!!!!

So, they actually charged me cash and then charged my card. Double charges have not only happened to me but ALL of my coworkers that have been to this location. My boss the other day told me he didn't go to heidis at all that week (or the week before) and found several transactions from heidis on his card. So they are also storing your card information. SCARY!!!!!!!

IF you decide to go there; take ONLY cash and keep your receipts.

Oh, forgot to mention, the employees are rude and they get your order wrong."}
{"text":"Holy cow, I had no idea this place was a chain, but I am so glad it is because I went to the Henderson location yesterday and loved it so much that I found the Las Vegas location on Charleston today. $5 for a half sandwich, drink, potato salad, pickle, and a cookie!  That is an insanely good deal, not to mention the fact that the half sandwich is HUGE and the bread and cookie are freshly baked.  Thank you Yelpers for pointing me to the Hell's Kitchen sandwich -- egg salad, bacon, avocado, and Cajun sauce.  Seriously delicious."}
{"text":"Bland bland boring bland flavorless flat dull generic tasteless bland hum drum weak 

Let me say boring and bland one more time."}
{"text":"Four stars?'really yelp? This place is not a Brooklyn deli. It's a generic franchised fast food deli. Everything is microwaved, including the hot dog which they put ketchup on. Ewwwww. Never again. I will say the people were nice...that was about the only good thing."}
{"text":"It's good NY style deli. Not a NY deli but close enough. Food is good and service is not bad. They have good beard too."}
{"text":"Not impressed!! I lived in New York for 10 years so i was very hopeful but my mother and i went there for lunch and i had the Cajun crab cake sandwich. The bread was hard, crab cake soggy and it hardly had any Cajun sauce. It came with a shot glass size of cole slaw and a pickle. I ended up taking crab off the hard bread. Mom had the Cajun turkey and had asked the young man to put Cajun sauce on side which he failed to do so when I took it back up to him to remake he was rude about it. Mom could not eat remake because of hard bread so I went back up and asked for a sample of their pastrami, more like a piece of rubber. Needless to say, we declined another sandwich and left. I do not recommend this pseudo \"NY\" style \"Deli\" at all! There are way too many better places to eat. Plus this place was over priced! Good luck!"}
{"text":"I do wish I could rate half stars or something.  I would probably go with a 3.5 on this place, but I decided to round up in this case because I really only have one complaint.  The food I ordered was very good.  They advertise a lot about their fresh baked daily bread, and it truly was really really good bread.  I ordered an Italian sub type sandwich on a hoagie roll and it was pretty darn good.  They made it fresh right in front of me.  It had a good portion of meats, sauce etc.  My only complaint at all was that I do think the place is a bit pricey for what they are offering.  Although the portions were good, I still spent $11.46 on a sandwich, chips, and a drink.  We know we can get cheaper lesser quality other places, so it really depends on you.  If you think a little extra quality, and better taste is worth that much more money, then this is a great place.  I personally don't mind spending a little extra for better food, but I won't do it often because it gets spendy."}
{"text":"I ordered the Italian submarine on an Italian hoagie with coleslaw and a tropical smoothie. 

It was good. Fresh. Coleslaw was kind of gross. Smoothie was delicious! Clean atmosphere, but looks kind of old. Friendly staff. Good place, but nothing too special."}
{"text":"Super extra terrible customer service. Dude walked in behind me, was in line behind me and they looked right passed me to help him cause he was a frequent customer. Another time after that I had the food and it was just flat out gross. Sadly gross."}
{"text":"Order the Hell's Kitchen Sandwich....simply scrumptious! I can't have anything else!"}
{"text":"I love this chain- sad that they closed the Charleston location near me, now I have to trek out to this one to get my fix of the Brooklyn Bomber. Best on rye bread, it's a pile of pastrami topped with a great egg salad. Add their Cajun sauce for a spicy kick. Maybe it's the drive, but it just doesn't quite taste as good as the old place. Still a great sandwich, though."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich place I have ever had! Was recommended by some Peoria Police Officer friends and police officers know good food! I get the Heidi's Club turkey and bacon and I add avocado and it's delicious! The workers are fast and friendly and bread is baked every day. Can't say anything bad about this place. A must have for a good sandwich"}
{"text":"This is going to be a short & sweet review.

I've been to this location and also the one on Sahara.  Both times I got the chicken salad.  Which is delicious!  I have gotten it on the bread (i love carbs!) and once on the wrap (the wrap is HUGE!).  All the sandwiches or wraps come with a pickle, and a side (chips, potato salad, mac salad or coldslaw).  I had the potato salad which was actually really good!  It's made with redskin potatoes.  Good seasoning and good flavor.  (its not mustard based).

Right now they are doing a $5 special.  I think its half of a sandwich or wrap, a side, a soda and a cookie.  Considering most of their sandwiches start at like $5.99 that is a damn good special."}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars I would. Worst place I've eaten on the west side, hands down. The first time I ate here-probably 4 years ago-I thought this place was only barely acceptable. Today taught me never to retry a place that basically sucks the first time! I ordered a small turkey wrap with no onion but I wanted avocado instead. It comes with turkey, lettuce, sprouts, cucumber and tomato. I was charged extra for the avocado. And they didn't put any on it!!! The sprouts were brown and slimy and it was wrapped in a way that everything just dumped out the end! Epic fail!!!! The only good part of the meal was the 2 forkfuls of potato salad that came with it. I'm disgusted."}
{"text":"I ordered the Veggie sandwich and the Brooklyn veggie wrap togo and I was kind of disappointed. The veggie sandwich was yummy and I love the fresh bread but the wrap was just sad! As you can see it just fell apart! ): it was very difficult to eat making it hard to enjoy it. I don't know if it was meant to be like this or if it was a mistake but I didn't like it unfortunately."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here in a very long time.  It used to be jam packed at lunch, with great food and great service.  It has went downhill!  There were 3 people ahead of me in line, but it took 10 minutes just to get my order and pay.  The 4 people working seemed very disorganized behind the counter, including the cashier answering call-in orders while I stood and waited to pay.  All the tables looked like they needed a good wipe-down, all covered in crumbs.  My husband's roast beef sandwich was blah, it didn't have any flavor, not even from the red onions.  My BLTA was just okay.  The \"A\" was almost nonexistent, with only two tiny slivers of avocado.  By no means was the food awful, but combined with all the other negatives, I will not be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"My family and l LOVE Heidi's. The food is excellent. I have only had great service and food. I highly recommend it!11"}
{"text":"I love the Salomon melt!!! although I am a little lethargic now and need a nap. =)"}
{"text":"As usual, excellent food and great service. Tried a smoothie this time and it was delicious. Sammiches are amazing."}
{"text":"I love heidi's...it is a little more expensive, but I think it's worth it! When I worked down 83rd...everyone would tell me about this place and finally I went. The people there are really nice and gave me a couple extra coupons to hand out when I got back to work. I love love love their tuna salad...you can get all the fixings but I just like it with lettuce. The sandwich is huge...thats why you have the option of half a sandwich. The bread is delicious, wish I could remember what type it is. It's only open for lunch and it can get pretty busy in here around noon so be warned. There were a couple times I came in on a lunch break took a look at the line and had to bone out and just go hungry for the day *tear* It's bad because you know when you crave something and nothing else sounds good. You get a pickle and a side with your meal..I get the slaw."}
{"text":"I have spent alot of time in Brooklyn and deli food is a staple of my diet. I can make a home-made sandwich that can compete with the best of them. Now based on a Las Vegas market (which when it comes to certain foods, lacking is the word that comes to mind) Delis are few and far between. At this time any deli out in these parts is a novelty. Other options include making a sandwich at home. Now this defeats the purpose of a deli-To have a delicious sandwich on the go with all the sides and trimmings with no prep or clean up.
H.B.D as far as local food of this genre has the competition beat. Of coarse the comp is the likes of Subway, Quiznos, port o' shit, and Jason's deli. All in all these are franchise delis and will never give you the real mom and pop, nitty gritty New York Deli style food much in demand world wide. 
I have eaten four different sandwiches at H.B.D (pastromi, cornedbeef, turkey club, sausage and peppers)all which satisfied my deli sandwich craving to 80%. It is just missing the authenticity. Even though they make one tastey marble rye I miss the old faithful kaiser roll and footlong italian bread which is signiture in NY.
PRICES- fair 7-10$
CHIPS-No selection and they use the small bags with only 8chips ??!!
PORTION-I was left a bit hungry for my buck
SIDES-Not many to choose and again tiny. I found the salads/slaw
bland.
SERVICE-very friendly, yet they botched one of my two sandwiches.
ATMOSHERE-open plan, no vibe, uninviting, clean, benches. 
MEAT-Seemed low quality, I have had some boarshead better.

The one on Eastern never has anyone there, I hope they don't go out of buisness because I will have no place better to get my cornbeef on Rye which does not say much. H.B.D wins by default."}
{"text":"Horrible place! The workers are EXTREMELY unprofessional! When I went, two young girls were working and they kept laughing and talking, they didn't even greet us at the door. One of the workers was wearing basketball shorts??? Regardless, they were giggling and it was super uncomfortable going in there. WILL NEVER VISIT THIS PLACE AGAIN, and I will DEFINITELY NOT recommend this sandwich place to ANYONE!!!!"}
{"text":"When in doubt, take a recommendation from some of the regulars.

The chicken salad sandwich is to die for. Well, maybe not actually, really, die for... but I'd drive there and pay full price for it.

Other reviewers are right -- this place is a bit pricey if you are on a budget -- but the way to get around that is to go for the daily special. For right around $6 you are out the door with your huge sandwich; a choice of chips, potato salad or coleslaw; and a drink. $1.50 buys you a giant chocolate chip cookie for dessert.

The other secret is that they sell their bread (if they have any left) after 2 pm. I'm still waiting to get a loaf of their sourdough to make into french toast on the weekend."}
{"text":"Cheap, Fresh, and Fast!! I come here for my lunch sometimes and they do not let me down...the sandwiches are made right before your eyes and the bread is literally sliced to order! they have many different types to order from or you can create your own."}
{"text":"Started working in the area and came across Heidi's by accident...

I've tried the Reuben and the Hell's Kitchen, which is an AMAZING egg salad sandwich.  Been there 4 times in the past 2 weeks.  Good stuff!!

Little disappointed on the size of the sandwiches when you get them to go.  Seems like you get more when you eat there."}
{"text":"Worst bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich I have ever had. Also the worst everything bagel I have ever had and the cream cheese I think was whipped and definitely had no flavor. Take Brooklyn off the name. If this place was actually in Brooklyn it wouldn't last a day"}
{"text":"I work close to this place and me and my co-workers go here for lunch. Besides being convenient it is very tasty and a good product, there is a Subway nearby also but I would not even bother with that crap compared to Heidi's, I rather spend an extra buck or two and really like what I am eating. Sometimes service is a little slow depending, if you go during lunch time you might have a good wait but otherwise it is not bad at all. I have ate there probably a dozen or more times and it was great every time."}
{"text":"Amazing. Hell's Kitchen is the best samich the portion is huge the Sammie is fresh and tasty I had the potato salad too which was great! Perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"Great selection of sandwiches - vegie to hot pastrami and liverwurst.  Really enjoyed the Chicken Salad.  Fresh breads made daily really enhance the experience.  Sides and beverages just the basics.  Staff are happy providing a nice repartee (if you participate).  Soups and salads also, but I can't comment as I didn't try them."}
{"text":"Every deli in New York (and within 500 miles) has bulkie rolls, caraway rye, fresh, hand sliced corned beef and pastrami and, yes, half sour pickles too. 

Change the name of your deli. It's a LIE."}
{"text":"I came here while at lunch at work. I've been to a few deli's and this was one of the best I've had. This was my first time here. I had gotten the Cajun turkey w/avaocado. The bread was so fresh that it was still steaming while she was making my sandwich. They had just taken the bread out of the oven. I had the potato salad along with my sandwich. Potato salad was really good also but that sandwich was awesome. 

I would have given this place 5 stars but the service was kind of whatever. The lady making my food was whatever and when I was going to pay I was just standing there waiting for someone to come by. They would see me but they would say one moment or something. So by the time I had paid my buddy who was ahead of me already devoured 75% of his sandwich. 

Otherwise this place has awesome sandwiches. I recommend."}
{"text":"we've only been to the new location on gibson near american pacific.  i loved it, nush said it was \"really good.\"  their bread is made fresh and tastes delicious.  so far the top favorites are the: crab-cake & the prime rib sandwich ."}
{"text":"Friday was 2nd time coming here on my lunch break and my first experience was much better. The first time I had a Philly that was great and the ordering/paying  process was smooth. This time I ordered the wrong bread (hoagie was hard), had to repeat my 1 sandwich order several times and then had to wait in line for longer than what should be standard to pay. The people in front of us had hot sandwiches and my dad had soup but we were standing in line just waiting to pay while other orders where being made. I think if this place can work out the kinks in that process it would make customers feel more comfortable and we'd tip much more. Also, they were out of wraps. :/"}
{"text":"Such a delicious sandwich. So much meat and sooo big. Yummy wheat bread, tasty Italian meats. Just loved it. Huge selection, so cant wait to try something different."}
{"text":"Heidi's is a small deli tucked into a nondescript strip mall near the Henderson Valley Automall. I resisted going to this place because it didn't have the reputation of say, an Oldtyme Deli, or Weiss's, but after one of their offerings given to me by a coworker, I'm hooked.  I have only had a couple of their sandwiches, but judging by the freshness of the bread and the quality of the ingredients, there's no reason anyone should overlook this place for a great New York style deli, unless they can't find it."}
{"text":"Tried it twice, and I think's it nice.

Honestly, Heidi's is pretty awesome. If you're ready through the reviews, you have probably heard that they make their own bread. All sorts of varieties which fills the air with fabulous scents. 

It really has a NY feel to it. The furniture and they layout.. you really feel like you're in the City until you look at the window and see actual trees.

The food:

I have been twice and have ordered the fabulous, well-priced lunch special ($5). I think both times I've gotten the Cajun Turkey with Avocado on wheat. The sandwich is awesome, but super spicy. Great flavor though. I'd recommend it. The macaroni salad is really good as well, but you only get about three bites. If you're hungry, opt for chips.

The first time I went the line was ridiculous, but it was definitely worth the wait. Today wasn't so bad, and it's Friday. Maybe go slightly before noon?

Five bucks for an appetizer (pickle), meal (chips/sandwich) and dessert cookie. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"First time going to Heidi's and heard that it was pretty good. There were four people ahead of us, and thought it wouldn't take too long. There were two people working, one to be presumed as the owner on a Saturday at noon. The man (presumed owner) was rude and seemed like he didn't want to be there, but proceeded with our sandwiches anyway, and checking out. The whole process took over 20 minutes. Would definitely not recommend if you need something quick. Upon sitting down, the two workers were on their phones and customers had to wait in line until they were noticed. 

Food was okay (reason for two stars), small portions, but the service and attitude of the workers are enough to be turned off. Not going out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Can't beat the $5 special!! Delicious food and friendly people. My only complaint is that there is always a long wait. Even when there's nobody in line, I feel like it takes the staff forever to make the sandwich. When there are lots of people in line, I usually just grab something at 7-11 next door instead (I only get a 30 min lunch break and I'm not wasting 20 of those in line lol)"}
{"text":"I have been eating at the BD for about a year 4-5 times a week.  Everything I have had is really good.  I was especially impressed with the corned beef sandwich piled high like in NYC.  I love the chicken salad sandwich, meatball sandwich, and hot sausage sandwich (although not spicy, but still good).  During the week at lunch time there is a line about 15 deep but you get your food pretty quick. Their bread is the best in PHX. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not impressed. No one there as far as customers. The big guy behind the counter was no help at all. TYPICALLY, when you mention you've never been somewhere that's your cue to fn  explain your menu. 
Ok, so we got our food to go and I'm home and we ate...
The food is good. Not $23.00 good but good. We got the #9 and the # 23. Two sandwiches two sides two sodas. 
The food is good but not outstanding enough to warrant a second visit."}
{"text":"I so enjoy their sandwiches here! However, I don't like paying the price of a chipotle burrito to get a deli sandwich. Albeit a fresh, tasty deli sandwich. 

As people say, their bread is absolutely delicious. Fresh baked each day. Sandwiches are creative and do represent various New York neighborhoods and aspects. As Rachel B. said, the transplanted new yorker is a wonderful combination of deli meats and cheese. I usually have mine on Ciabatta bread. 

Overall: They have a bunch of different deli meat sandwiches, Mortadella, Corned Beef, Roast Beef, Honey Ham, Bacon, Prosciutto, Salami, Pastrami, Turkey, Liverwurst. I think there's a couple more. Cheeses, Avocado, Fresh Veg, etc. Oh and a really tasty Spicy Mayo! 

Sandwich comes with pickle and choice of potato salad, coleslaw, or chips. There are soups, wraps and smoothies on the menu as well. 

Service is incredibly friendly and they always make sure to explain to new customers what the place is about. And usually mention that when the Cavs are training they order food from there. 

It's good. Try it out if you're near."}
{"text":"First time there today. Long line, but sign on window states long lines because our food is good. Ordered the chicken salad on toasted wheat to go. Bread was not toasted and I have never had sweet chicken salad. WAY sweet. Won't order that again. Not sure if I will try them again."}
{"text":"Ordered a combo. The soup was microwaved using a styrofoam cup and the French dip was horrible. The au jus was probably microwaved as well and was flavor less. The bread tasted old. Just not at all what I expected"}
{"text":"ordered a Rueben sandwich and they microwaved the meat and kraut, pathetic excuse for a NY Deli."}
{"text":"Pretty good find on a hunt for lunch. Had a tasty wrap but was disappointed the Tomato Basil soup was already gone....at prime lunchtime...unacceptable. Overall, we may try this place again when in the area."}
{"text":"I went to Heidi's for the first time today. I got the special for $6.99(during August)--a 1/2 sandwich, side, pickle, cookie, and a drink. I had the chicken salad sandwich. Sooooo yummy! And the cookies are awesome, too. I did ask the cashier if there was a frequent/loyal customer card. She said no, but that it was a great idea. I would definitely come back, and especially if a loyalty card was implemented."}
{"text":"Love that the breads are made fresh daily. I got hot pastrami and marble rye. Good sandwich but nothing spectacular. The bread was very good though. Sandwiches are a decent size but the sides are tiny. I'll be back cause I really want to try the Cajun crab cake sandwich. Just wasn't feeling that adventurous today. Lol!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. I Work down the street at the barber shop and my sandwich is always fresh. We always get delivery and they're pretty prompt. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting quality fresh delicious food."}
{"text":"I got the lunch special and I was not disappointed it was a good size portion for me I got the chicken salad on wheat with coleslaw and the cookie was cooked to perfection !!! It was my first time and I didn't really know the menu and the staff wasn't as helpful as I would have liked but I rate my reviews solely off the food. I will be back to try something new !!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Some folks take tome getting used to the deli style ordering system, but the sammiches are great! I love the Cajun Turkey with Avacado, the bomb.

Try this place out if you ion the area."}
{"text":"Overpriced and dirty in just a few words....... the sandwiches we ordered were less than tasty."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty ! Staff is amazing i  came in and simply said I need a hungry gurl sandwich !!! She recommended the Italian sub 3 different kinds of salami ham on an Italian hoagie! Fresh bread is soft and just delicious ! I'll always come back! #Tastetastic only con is I wish they were at least open til 8pm lol"}
{"text":"Here's the thing, the food is actually pretty good. I'm not from Brooklyn or anything but the sandwiches I've eaten there are certainly tasty.

My biggest tip to you is be aware that as of late, any addition or change to your sandwich costs you extra. Prices of ingredients go up and that's fine... but don't start adding those ingredient and THEN tell me it's going to be extra.

There's a lady there who consistently starts adding cheese or will scoop a big helping of avocado on your sandwich and then say \"Oh, that's going to be $1.50 extra, is that ok?\"

As long as you're aware... good food."}
{"text":"Gotta agree, staff isn't the most upbeat. Seemed annoyed when I mentioned, Yelp listed them closed. Sandwhich was good, better thank Quiznos. Wish they had more veggie topping options. I had the chicken salad on pumpernickle. Very generous sized sandwhich for price."}
{"text":"Terrible service. A bunch of kids running this place. What's with the lox. I ordered a nova and bagel platter and they cooked the salmon and it was broken into little pieces that's not how lox and bagels is served. Very confused and really don't want to complain to these children."}
{"text":"Was going over by bookmarks for lunch and this was right down the street. The four star average caught my eye so off I went. 

Located off of Charleston, there is only one driveway going into this Red Rock Plaza so if for any reason you are trying to escape the police in your car, don't go in here. :P

As I am going over the menu, I see there is a lot of choices. The guy behind the counter suggests I get the 5.99 combo. What's that I ask. He mumbled something about half a sandwich, a side, and a drink. I said nope. I was wanting a full sandwich damnit.

So I go with the Italian, which has cappacola, salami, ham, montadella, provolone, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, oil n vinegar, salt n pepper, and oregano on Italian bread. Sounds good right? NOOOOOOOOO! 

The bread to meat ratio was rather large. The bread itself didn't seem fresh and there was a lot of it. If you refer to my pic, the overall size of the sandwich is mostly bread. The meat didn't seem much. I think dude forgot to put oil and vinegar for I don't remember my taste buds ever tasting any. When I got done, I still had some bread left over after running out of what like 3 or 4 kinds of meat I think? Total I paid was 8 and some change. 

The place is pretty big with enough tables and chairs for about 40 people.

Customer service was ok. Dude did his job. Nothing extraordinary.

As I was leaving, I couldn't help but think of how this place could average 4 stars. To be fair, if I just happen to make another visit and my experience is better, then I will update this review accordingly. Sorry Heidi, I was not impressed.

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #28"}
{"text":"This is my new go-to place for a quick and healthy lunch. As soon as you walk in the door, you're blasted with the awesome aroma of freshly baked bread, which tastes AMAZING! They have this awesome deal called the Heidi's Special which includes 1/2 a sandwich, a side (chips, cole slaw, or potato salad), a cookie, AND a drink for only $5!! It can't get any better than that! And you definitely can't get that deal at Subways. And the 1/2 sandwich is more than enough to fill you up. So next time you're looking for somewhere new to try for lunch or dinner, give Heidi's a shot! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place everything is delicious. My favorites are the awesome salad or tuna sandwich. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a change of pace for lunch on a Saturday and since there aren't many good sandwich places in the west valley we decided Heidi's sounded good.

When we placed our orders they made the sandwiches right in front of us, Italian on a sub roll for my wife and a Reuben on marble rye for myself.  Wow, that bread was fantastic, you can tell that it's freshly made.  It's soft and moist, I loved it.  You get a choice of several types, but we stuck with the defaults.  The sandwiches were also generously piled with the ingredients, I had corned beef on sauerkraut.  The meat had great flavor and the sides were also quite wonderful.  You get your choice of potato salad, cole slaw, or chips.  I had the slaw and wife had the potato salad.  Both tasted better than store bought, but I think the sandwiches were the stars.

The store was roomy and open, it was fine for a deli.  The sandwiches were in the $6-$7 range.  There were soups and wraps as well.  We'll definitely be trying there again, as it's much better than Quizno's, Blimpies, and definitely Subway."}
{"text":"Ordered the crabcakes worst idea, ever. Service is awful The place's atmosphere reeks of death. The trays are hoarded and if you throw them away the employees are forced to dig for them. And to top it off the food is so extremely expensive. Just keep driving, go to sprouts across the street get a better sandwich for way less. Hey even Subway would be a better choice."}
{"text":"Seriously the fuckin bomb ! The best sandwich ever !!!the tomato basil soup is really good too my boyfriend had the the pastrami and I had the tuna . Definitely my new favorite spot ! They have wraps too looking forward to going back for more !"}
{"text":"The food is very fresh. The staff is polite & doesn't rush you & allows you to ask all the questions you need. Reasonably priced also. The benches need to be replaced & a good thorough cleaning of the dining area would help but I would very much recommend this deli."}
{"text":"Not your regular sandwich place. Last time i was here the cashier recommended I try the Cajun crab cake, and I opted for the salmon instead. This time I took her up on it and OMG. It to die for. I really didn't expect for a crab cake sandwich to be good. And when the lady was making it i was regretting it lol. But I'm glad I stuck it out. 

The Caribbean spice smoothie also sounds weird but is really really good ! I'm so glad they don't have unoriginal flavors of anything here.

Even the potato salad was better than most."}
{"text":"Me and my husband tried this place for this first time on Monday and have gone everyday this week! I'm not sure what took us so long to try it but great place for lunch. Quick service too, we are always in and out in less than 10 min. The bread is probably my favorite as it's baked in house and so fresh and soft. Prices are great too! Everything we have gotten so far has not been a disappointment, can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Normally I love this place. I ordered a sandwich though a delivery service and received my order incorrect and an item missing.  After 5 or 6 attempts to call them they finally answered.  I explained my issues and they told me what they received on their end for my order, which was different. They totally ignored that I was missing an item. I understand there is some sort problem with their system not printing everything but they tried to blame me for not entering it correctly  (even though I did and have a copy of it). They, in not so many words, told me too bad.  I have never had a restaurant try to fix a problem. This is very disappointing since I really like the food and have been a customer for years. They will be missed."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Typical deli-style sandwiches and what have you. 

The customer service, however, was not anywhere near acceptable. A person in my party asked what was in a particular sandwich. The man behind the counter responded with, \"You did not just ask me that!\" He then proceeded to stare at us for about 10 seconds before telling us what was in the sandwich. 

If a deli, or any restaurant for that matter, wants a new customer to return, try not being so damn rude!"}
{"text":"Not coming back. I heard it was good but was completely disappointed. Overpriced and small food portions for money paid. Vegetable soup was cold and wasn't the same as advertised in the picture. In the picture there were zucchini, carrots, potatoes and corn but in reality there were only rice and potatoes. Rude service, the old guy looked he didn't want to be there and when I asked for something he just did it without smiling or answering my request. Sandwich did not come with cheese and (before ordering) I was told it was free of charge but when I ordered my sandwich, this rude person did not ask me if I wanted cheese (I forgot to request but still I should be asked) and of course...I didn't get any. Paid $15 for a very small portion and cold soup, rude staff. The female cashier was the only one nice in there. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"BIG portions. I usually get half a sandwich and it's enough for me. They have weekly specials. The bread is pretty thick so I ask for them to slice as thin as possible."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday for a casual late lunch and a first time visit.  I decided to order the 1/2 turkey wrap, soup combo.  Veggies were fresh and the tortilla was soft but the turkey portion seemed to be very meek.  The chicken and rice soup hit the spot.  My partner in crime ordered the daily special (egg salad) on marbled rye.  She was surprised that they cut the bread slices by hand to order and that the bread was so thick and tasty.  She said the egg salad was delicious and was only able to finish half of her sandwich it was so big.  We were inspired to try Heidi's again and hope to order hot deli sandwich, Cajun crab cake sandwich and a smoothie next visit."}
{"text":"Nice little deli. Staff is friendly and food is good. Place is always clean when I have had lunch there. Prices are good also."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop. The bread is to die for!   I love the Cajun turkey but any sandwich you get will be great with their bread. They make their bread in-house and sell it off at the end of the day so it is always fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place. Sandwiches are so big that I can split it between 2. Great fresh bread and soups as well."}
{"text":"Went there for a quick lunch with my coworker. The service is fast and staff are all friendly. For 5 bucks, you get a half sandwich, a side (chips, potato salad or cole slaw), a cookie, and a drink. That's a pretty good deal. All their bread are freshly baked and delicious. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"As a seafood-vegetarian, I'm often stuck with the  too-much-mayo salad sandwich.  Thank you, Heidi's, for taking pity on us non-meat eaters and giving us options!! The Cajun Crabcake and Salmon Melt sandwiches rock my world. And, in trying to compete with its $5-footlong neighbor down the street, Heidi's offers a $5 combo, which includes a 1/2 sandwich, chips, a pickle, a chocolate chip cookie and a drink. Damn, Gina... now that's some EATS!"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch almost every day and it's always delicious! The family that owns it is amazing and it's always quick. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Decent lunch selection.  I liked the fact that the sandwich bread was cut from a fresh loaf; you don't see that too often.  6 dollar lunch special is a good deal...half sandwich, small side, fountain drink (they have ice tea) and a small cookie.  My meal: ham and swiss on wheat bread, macaroni salad, chocolate chip cookie and an arnold palmer.  Pretty decent food quality as far as I can tell.  Out the door for under 6.50."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming my go-to spot for lunch especially if I'm craving sammiches. Now I've never been to Brooklyn or NY for that matter so I couldn't tell you how close it is to the actual 'brooklyn deli' style but I'm telling you it's some good stuff.

You make a choice between cold or heated sammiches and both are equally as tasty. My favs are the Bronx bomber (pastrami with egg salad) and the awesome cheesesteak. All sammiches comes with a side of potato, macaroni or snacks.

Facility is always clean and tidy af. Warning! They do have some weird hours. They close at 5pm on the weekdays and are closed during the weekends (lolwut). Dunno what's up with that but otherwise they are stellar I definitely recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Just because it says Deli and says Brooklyn, do not mistake for Jewish or New York. 
Sadly, this place felt like a glorified Subway but the fact that the bagels come off the Sysco truck clinched the truth for me. Good thing the Dunkin' Donuts across the parking lot has bagels too!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed let alone that it was a chain. 

Searching for a quick lunch spot between two meeting places, Heidi's Deli popped up on the Yelp app and figured why not, seems A-OK! The service here is fast, but not so friendly, this didn't deter me from still enjoying my lunch and catching on up on some emails.

I got the Cajun Turkey with avocado; sliced deli style turkey, tomato, lettuce, avocado and spicy Cajun \"sauce\". If you look up turkey sandwich in the dictionary there's picture of this sandwich next to it... look nailing it isn't a bad thing, but damn man, spice this bad boy up. Adding some spicy mayo doesn't really do the trick. This might be the basic b*tch of sammies. 

The service here doesn't come with a smile either. I was a little confused with ordering process and asked a question about building your sandwich or using a prefixed menu and I was made to feel like I just asked where babies come from. BTW - A stork's butt is what I still think. 

It does the trick for a quick lunch, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Love this place! We've come here for years. Love the sourdough bread, sometimes we buy a loaf to take home. My favorite is the Hells kitchen, I also love the pastrami on rye, the crab cakes are great...  So many great sandwiches. Always friendly service."}
{"text":"No what I was hoping for.  

First, let me say that the girls working the counter were very nice and helpful.  That is why this is three stars instead of two. 

The good:

The bread is very good
The service is good
The portions are good
The coleslaw is good

The bad:

The price:  $21 for two sandwiches, two bags of chips and two fountain drinks is way too much.
The fact that I had to pay $0.50 to get cheese for a pastrami on rye.  This is why I'll never go back. Seriously, that's messed up!
All \"hot\" sandwiches will be microwaved.  
Oh, no! You did not just throw roast beef in a microwave and call it a Philly Cheese Steak. That's sacrilege!


The food was actually not too bad.  My wife was skeptical about ordering the Philly but she tried it and thought it was alright, but she wouldn't order it again.  The only redeeming factors here where the service and the bread.  Not enough to bring me back, but others will be OK with this place.  Maybe some of their other food is better?"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a higher review. However, the service was less than stellar. My husband and I decided to stop here to grab a sandwich after the gym. I looked on this exact Yelp page to see if they took Apple Pay- it specifically said 'yes'. I walked in, only customer in the place, and went to order my food. The older gentleman behind the counter could use a little sunshine in his life. He works in the service industry- a friendly smile and 'how are you' goes a long way. He didn't make eye contact the entire time and seemed extremely unhappy to be there. When I went to pay, I told him I had Apple Pay, and he proceeded to give me my total. I asked him where I use Apple Pay at and he stared at me, with an annoying stare, and said \"credit card\" and shrugged his shoulders. I told him this Yelp page said it accepted Apple Pay. He just told me it was a corporate page, not his. Based off his behavior alone, I would question going back. Word of mouth goes a long way- that's unfortunate. Regardless of being able to use Apple Pay or not, I've been to shitty fast food places that give better service than this guy does. I've worked in the service industry for 20 years- I would never allow an employee to act this way. Happy Saturday !"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious French dip sandwich.  I love the service and the price is just right"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Highly recommend you trying the Bronx Bomber. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had."}
{"text":"My dad went in there three times in the past couple weeks to get their 'take out' and based on his experience, I wouldn't recommend take-out from this place. The first time he ordered a large soup to go they gave him a teeny tiny container which he didn't realize until he got home. The next time he specified large and told them what happened last time and they gave him two mediums and a small container (their version of a large) and as they were placing the soup in the bag they shoved it in so hard that the cheap styrofoam containers broke and leaked through the bag everywhere and burned his hands. So the next time we brought our own container in and explained that we will pay for large but request that after they measure it all out they put the soup in our container. We told them what happened last week when we were In there so they would understand the request. They were dismissive and said we don't sell large anymore we can only sell you two mediums. What they gave was mostly broth and hardly any noodles or chicken yet they charged for a large without offering an apology for breaking the containers last time and burning us. So the service here leaves a lot to be desired. The food is tasty but I don't think we will be going back based on principle due to such horrible service."}
{"text":"Love this place!! These sandwiches are delicious, & huge. Try their spicy sauce, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh Heidi, please take Brooklyn out of your name.  You're disappointing your NYC friends.  Your reuben was ok, but if I were in Brooklyn, this would be one star.  Yes, the bread is homemade, but if the goodies in between aren't great, it doesn't matter.  The sides weren't appetizing, so we ended up with a bag of Lay's potato chips.

Bummer.

The caesar salad was laughable.  Romaine topped with shaved parm and store-bought dressing.

Heidi -- call yourself an average deli.  We'd all be much better off."}
{"text":"''Hell's Kitchen'' Avocado (bomb) Bacon (bomb) Swiss Cheese (bomb) Egg salad w/ mayo & honey pepper (bomb) on either Pumpernickle or Rye. BOMB."}
{"text":"Just a bragging point: I've totally been to the original Heidi's Brooklyn Deli in Denver, Colorado. Its Peoria counterpart is a fantastic place to get lunch in the West Valley. 

I have sampled quite a few of the menu items. I do tend to stay away from anything with mustard, ham, bologna type meats, and rye bread. However, the meatball on Italian bread and the chicken marinara on French bread are delicious menu options. I also like the Club sandwich on the croissant. They also have a \"build your own\" option if nothing on the menu looks appealing (an impossible feat). Every sandwich comes with a bag of chips and a pickle. 

The milkshakes and malts are made from real ice cream (also available by the scoop) with generous portions. All of the desserts are fabulous, but they advertise the cheesecake as \"homemade\" and I'm pretty sure it is not. 

Heidi's also serves breakfast, but I've never gotten around to trying it. I would love to sample their lox bagel because it looks out of this world. 

The prices are more than reasonable for the portion sizes and quality that Heidi's offers! My only complaint is that the restaurant keeps odd hours. It seems like they are never open when I get a sandwich craving!"}
{"text":"Holy Hannah....I can't believe that I never knew about this place! Now, I am always in the mood for a good sandwich. Heidi's is where you will find me from now on...probably more often than I should be. The two calorie/fat ladened sandwiches that my friend and I split have probably taken about 2 years off my life but they were well worth it.

The Cajun Crab Cake Sandwich was to die for!! The crab cake was crisp/hot and the special spicy sauce was delectable. We had our choice of homemade breads and decided to go with the French Hoagie....fresh and soft. And if that wasn't enough we had to be gluttonous and try one of their cold sandwiches.  Since it was Halloween day and we were in a festive mood we decided to go with the Hell's Kitchen sandwich....wow...I never thought egg salad would taste so good between layers of bacon, swiss, avocado and their special spicy sauce. 

Good prices and a very friendly staff....Heidi's is a spot to try if you are looking a good sandwich away from the norm. Be warned...they are addicting...."}
{"text":"Popped by here with my guy, I had a nice cheesesteak and I loved the pickle and potato salad with my sandwich.  Prices were good and the menu has a lot to offer.  Definitely going back again to try other menu items!  There's some really creative sandwiches here that I'd never imagine the flavors mixing, so definitely check it out"}
{"text":"They make FRESH BREAD daily and often! SUPER YUMMY Reuben!! You MUST try!  I'd give them a 5 star if they can improve on their order time with customers. It was slow. Yet, the customer service is appreciated. : )"}
{"text":"i come from new york.  lived in staten island all my life...next door to brooklyn.   this is a franchise, not a real brooklyn deli.  i ordered a pastrami sandwich. it had about 2 slices of pastrami on it.  thats not a way to make a sandwich....a real deli would pile it on like katz's deli in manhattan.  one of the worst sandwiches i ever had.  then my wife wanted a nathan's hot dog. the lady thought they were out . but finally found some in the back room.  i would never return to this establishment again....i was totally unsatisfied.....i would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"my coworkers love this place, but i find them to be just okay.  for the price you pay, i think they could put a little more meat in the sandwiches.  i'd rather go to Cugino's, Table 34, or Panevino.  i also feel they are pretty slow at making your sandwhiches, especially during lunch hour and there is a long line of people.  either their process needs to speed up or the workers need to speed up.  either way, something has to change with their service."}
{"text":"Food is sooo good here!! Hands down the best, freshest bread in town! I would go here and just eat the bread!! But the sandwiches  are very good too. The line can get long sometimes but they always move quickly and it's worth any wait"}
{"text":"I love the food here it is some of the best sandwiches I have ever had, but I will make sure when I go again I will not order or stay when they have three of the rudest don't care about their jobs kids working behind the counter. They made me feel like it was an Inconvenience  that they had to help me. Stood in front of the blond with a pink bandana in her hair for 3 minutes before she said a word to us.  Then she said someone will be with you in a Minute. Well low and behold she ended up helping us (if that's what we are calling the poor customer service). The young boy behind the counter you could tell was not real excited about being there and was wanting to be somewhere else and the third dark haired girl looked lost and scared and had no clue just sat and stared blankly. So yes I will go there but will walk out if I see any of these three behind the counter."}
{"text":"First, all their sandwiches are to died for, one of my person faves are the Hell's Kitchen with no bacon, with bacon it's also good (vegetarian that's why) all their soups are delicious and there sides dishes too! They do have vegan/vegetarian options, but every time I go in to buy something off their veg menu they NEVER have anything, but I am telling you to try their food tho, if ever in doubt get the Hell's Kitchen. They also have AWESOME COSTUMER SERVICES"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and they are always wearing a smile, if you want a real deli experience show up and place an order. (Hint) try the New Yorker."}
{"text":"This was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! The Italian Sub was so full of meat and fixings I could barely eat it. The bread was delicious and tasted freshly baked. All the toppings were super fresh too!"}
{"text":"More like 2.5, but again, Yelp won't let you give half stars...and I can't round up on these guys.

First and foremost, I'm just gonna be blunt here, do not call yourself a deli...you aren't a deli.  I'll be OK with sandwich shop, but you are most certainly not a deli.  Giving a pickle with your sandwich does not make you a deli.  

And, while we're at it, take Brooklyn out of your name, too...there is absolutely nothing Brooklyn about you.

As for what killed this place for me...the excessive microwaving and re-heating of everything.  That's not called cooking, that's called preparing...and I can do that at home.

Having said all of that, the food was OK.  Nothing special...nothing inoffensive.  The meatballs (frozen) were tasty...the marinara (canned) was tasty...my daughter's Nathan's Hot Dog was as it should be, if not a bit too nuked, along with the microwaved bun.  The roastbeef on the beef dip was ok but the nuking was excessive.

I won't be going back and will not recommend to anyone I know...not because it is awful...just unnecessary...and ill-named."}
{"text":"Went here with a buddy who loves it, mostly because of their $5 lunch special (which was actually $5.99 and therefore 6 bucks in my book, but still reasonable enough.)
For that meager sum, you get 1/2 a sandwich, drink, cookie, and a choice of chips or side salad.

  The sandwich is generous, and on the plus side they slice the bread right from the loaf as you order. I chose rye because I like it, but for the future,  clearly the correct strategy would be to eyeball which loaf is about half gone so you will get the maximum slice out of the middle. Yes, I am a pig. She got the Hell's Kitchen, which involved egg salad, Swiss cheese, bacon, and hot sauce.  Surprisingly good combo of richness, smokiness, and a little heat. Thumbs up. I tried the chicken salad, and it was just how I like it. Chunks of chicken, a little sweetness, and no hard things to ruin the whole experience. 

For my side, I got the chips since they came in a bag and were a normal serving. Side salads were dished out in those tiny little plastic cups one associates with ketchup or tartar sauce, not cole slaw. WTF? Good thing I observed this in time to order accordingly. I suggest you do the same.

And I agree this is misnamed as a deli. Definitely a sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!the sourdough bread is to die for! I also recommend the Cajun sauce so good! Gotta love the lunch specials as well. The make all there bread at the store and you can tell it's homemade!also Wednesday is free cookie Wednesday!"}
{"text":"This is the best off the strip sandwich spot. Everytime I'm in Vegas, this is the first place I stop before heading into the casinos. Their selection is fantastic and the half sandwich, drink & chips is a steal."}
{"text":"In my never ending quest to find a good east coast deli hot pastrami sandwich I decided to stop by Heidi's Brooklyn Deli.  I was somewhat apprehensive yet optimistic when I pulled up to Heidi's for lunch the other day. After all there were several \"signs of goodness\" as carefully evaluated my surroundings upon entering Heidi's. 

Sign #1 this place was going to be good; they were very busy when I walked in; hence there might be a reason why, busy usually = good eats.     

Sign #2 this place was going to be good; I noticed there were a lot of older peeps, aka snow-birds eating here as I walked in; hence there might be a reason why, older peeps usually know where the good deli's are.     

Sign #3 this place was going to be good; the smell of fresh cooked bread hits you in the face as you walk in; hence there might be a reason why, fresh cooked bread usually = fresh cooked everything

Well to my chagrin this did not hit mark but it was an enjoyable experience. My hot pastrami was shaved cold cut and heated. My rye was the best feature of this main event.  It was awesome, well balanced with just enough crisp vs chew and extremely fresh. My potato salad and cole slaw was store bought not fresh.  I asked the person that was waiting on me why they don't offer more fresh options and she stated it's all about the bread and their fresh approach to sandwich selections.  

They offer several different sandwich selections other than the traditional such as a chipotle chicken with guac, spicy may, veggies on a baguette or bread of your choice.  I sampled that as well on a second visit and it was good but most definitely not east coast.

Lesson learned; Pay no attention to \"signs\" for people have different taste and expectations of what a good deli should be in Phoenix.  Heidi's is a great alternative to burger and fries. They have wonderful breads and offer a good selection of sandwiches, salads and soups."}
{"text":"Had a good meal at Heidi's and would make a visit again in the future. The menu options are many. Today, we tried the Bronx bomber (pastrami and egg salad), Reuben (corn beef), and a chicken noodle soup bread bowl. The bomber was tasty but for me, the bread was the best part of the sandwich. The Reuben was the best sandwich and full of flavor. Again, the bread used with the Reuben was awesome. Lastly, chicken soup bread bowl was good, but didn't love the bread as much with the bowl then on the sandwiches. Overall, good sandwiches at a fair price and really liked the amount of sandwich options."}
{"text":"I work right by this place and have tried it a few times.  The food is good, especially the Transplanted New Yorker (or something like that). BUT, I have to say, its overpriced.  $9.00 for a sandwich and tiny bag of chips is too much in my opinion, so I won't be going there too often.  That's a shame because the food is quite good."}
{"text":"If you like crab meat and Cajun spices then you've got to try their Cajun Crab Cake sandwich.   I order it with pepper jack cheese, avocado, and Cajun sauce on toasted Ciabatta bread.  It is the best and the only sandwich I ever order from them."}
{"text":"Dirty food preparation,  the guy was on phone and then he when to prepare a sandwich.   The food has no taste , subway would of been better!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good, too bad the customer service is so poor. Our office order was wrong, drove all the way back. Instead of making it right, (I even offered to pay again) they just stood there and argued with me that it was what we ordered. Ok, but I can't eat it so can you please make me another sandwich?? I had to yell out that I would pay, begged them to  please make the right sandwich. Seriously, are you kidding me? What a nightmare, completely unprofessional workers and management. Too many choices, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the best experience here at Heidi's! They saw me sitting outside with my pup and brought him a bowl of water and some cheese and salami for him to snack on! The service is great but the food is amazing! I love the freshly baked bread! We will definitely be visiting here again!"}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for sandwiches! The bread is fresh baked every day, I am a big fan of the sourdough myself. My go to favorite sandwich is the hot pastrami on sourdough, he people at the front are pretty friendly and the portions are good size. You have to try the potato salad, fresh made as well! I drive out of my way to get this sandwich because the freshness of the bread and meat is what really makes it."}
{"text":"This is one of my very favorite lunch spots. A bit hard to find, but worth it. Soup in a breadbowl is EXCELLENT. Try the cajun turkey with avacado. For a treat, add bacon! Actually theres not much i dont like on the menu."}
{"text":"Exceptional salads and sandwiches.  Their \"awesome salad\" is a great meal without being too heavy, and with very good nutrition.  The shakes/smoothies are excellent too.  The only downside is the longer wait during rush times."}
{"text":"$8.00 for a small, Deli-Sandwich and a tablespoon of Potato Salad. 
Quality is good but portion size for price is not.
Location is everything here and probably the only reason for the revenue to stay in operation."}
{"text":"I had the Coney Island Reuben with potato salad. The bread was fresh and toasted. The sandwich was pretty good mostly because of the delicious bread. The potato salad side was a little smaller than expected. I like the fact that they bring your food out to you with out a number or name they just remember who ordered it."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm not a huge fan of sandwich places but my bf took me here for lunch one time and I totally fell in love with this place.

It was very busy and I can see why.

They have a few different sandwiches to choose from i got the Cajun Turkey w/ Avocado with a side of macaroni salad. Omg this was probably the most delicious sandwich Ive ever had the bread was so fresh and soft and the cajun mayo was super delicious and the avocado just made it even better. I finished every single bite and this is coming from someone who hates sandwiches. The macaroni salad was also tasty very sweet and delicious. 

I can see why this place is always packed, even writing this review makes me crave one of their tasty sandwiches. 

Good quality food, friendly service and decent prices = happy customer"}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  Floor was dirty.

LIKE  The sesame bagel. The breakfast sandwich. The Power Punch smoothie.

LOVE  Nothing."}
{"text":"I try really hard to be patient and polite when food places fu@! up my order to avoid a juicy loogie in my sandwich or my bun being used to mop the floor. But how is it possible for a sandwich shop to make sandwiches wrong EVERY TIME?
Why give people the option of  mayo or mustard, choice of bread, lettuce, tomato, onions, sprouts, choice of cheese when they dont give you what you ask for. Is it only when they feel like it?

After the 5th or 6th time of screwing up, my anger turned into a humorous game. Kind of like those HIGHLIGHT books you had as a kid. The \"WHATS MISSING?\" game. A picture of a horse with no leg or bicycle with no tires. Thats what comes to mind when I hear someone mention \" Heidi's Deli\"

 I ordered the usual turkey sandwich on rye bread and got a tuna fish sandwich. At least they got the mayo right even though its mixed in with the tuna.

I  personally went to heidi's to see what idiot makes my sandwich. Just curious... Maybe if I personally go up there, its a lesser chance to fu@* up my sandwich.

A polite woman with somewhat broken english takes my order. She already starts off wrong by giving me the wrong bread. She apologizes and asks me \"what kind of bread was it again?\" Rrrrrrrrggghhh...
While making my sandwich, a police man comes in and she starts making small talk. Shouldnt you be focusing on making my sandwich?
I couldnt see everything she was doing because the counter is so high. In the end, after driving to the park with my sandwich in my hand, no cheese, no pickle and no onions.

No offense, but Heidi must be blonde."}
{"text":"I was drawn in and enticed by the combination of the words \"Brooklyn\" and \"Deli.\"  Unfortunately, this was no New York deli experience. 

My Cajun Turkey & Avocado Sandwich was a disappointment. The bread to meat ratio was not proportionate. The hoagie roll was much too thick and, honestly, a little dry. The Cajun sauce came through prominently and had a nice kick. I had a difficult time locating the meat because it was overshadowed by mouthfuls of bread. The scant amount of meat I was able to encounter tasted as if it came out of a package. My lunch companion's sandwich was better; his sourdough bread was more fresh than my hoagie roll. Nevertheless, his option was also fairly average. I was really looking forward to a sandwich reminiscent of what I usually experience in NYC: large stacks of  meat on thin, soft, doughy bread.  

The pickle included was not fresh or crunchy; rather, it was limp and sad. NY deli pickles always have a classic crunch.

What also turned me off was the unfriendliness of the staff, specifically by the two older gentlemen that assisted us. They seemed annoyed that we had to ask what types of breads and sides they offered. I suppose that's the only thing authentic about this \"Brooklyn deli\" : the NY attitude."}
{"text":"Went at lunch. Great service. Good size portions and fair pricing. Such a pleasant find. Had the Reuben and it was very tasty. Will be back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Definitely not the most original bagels, somewhat overpriced. Reuben was decent quality but didn't taste good. Had a few other bagels and coffee and they weren't so good. Service is great."}
{"text":"I went here around 10am. The sign said open at 8am but it looked like they were just opening. When I walked in the lady at the counter looked like she was setting up & counting her money. Then a couple members of her staff walked in & she seemed relieved that they showed up. My brother in law says they have good sandwiches & bagels there so I ordered a veggie jalepeño bagel sandwich. I needed my morning fix so I asked if she had coffee. She said that they only had hazelnut which was ok for me. The sandwich was pretty good. The coffee was alright. The place was clean. The staff was alright. They weren't that friendly. Maybe cause they just woke up. Lol"}
{"text":"I've ordered take out a couple of times from here and there Foods pretty good the portions are on the small side. The first time I came the Reuben was pretty good and there was a decent amount of meat in it. The last two times I got takeout the sandwich was much smaller there was hardly any meat and it was very dry. There's not a lot of consistency in their food preparation."}
{"text":"1st time there had pastrami on rye with coleslaw, It was very delicious. The hubby had Philly french bread toasted also great.My son had a kids giant hotdog and fresh fruit smoothie ,He ate the whole thing! My favorite part was the girls whom attend to us they were very patient and helpful. Definitely going back to give the 5th star!"}
{"text":"Was just delivered the worst pastrami sandwich I have ever seen.  A little bit of meat between a dry roll - NOTHING ELSE!  No au jus, no special sauce. Obviously these people are not very passionate about what they do."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today. There was a line when I came in but they had me out the door with my order in less than 10 minutes. I ordered 2 sandwiches because I was starving and figured the quantities were small. I was pleasantly surprised! Let's just say one sandwich was so big I only ate half. I recommend the Hell's Kitchen on sourdough and the Cajon Crab Cake on sourdough. They have wraps, soups, and ice cream too (: Super good grub."}
{"text":"Great service and reasonable prices. There can be a line, but it goes fast. Hubby got French dip. It was good, but the meat and jus were heated in the microwave. It would have been better if the meat was heated in the jus, but it still had good flavor. My chicken salad sandwich was yummy. Very simple recipe letting the chicken shine. I like chicken salad with apples or grapes in it, but this was still very good. It has a little honey for the touch of sweetness that the fruit would give, so I was still happy. But bottom line, it's all about the bread! They make it fresh in house daily and have the beautiful crusty loaves sitting on a bakers rack in the back to tempt you. I had my chicken salad on their wheat bread. Slightly sweet, like a squaw bread, with whole oats flecking the top. It would pair well with a turkey sandwich too. Hubby's was on the French roll which sopped up the jus like a sponge, yet still held its shape. I can't wait to go back to try their marbled rye and their sourdough!"}
{"text":"So one day we're waiting on a prescription and absolutely ravenous. We avoided all of the chains and stumbled on Heidi's while turning around in their parking lot. 

The place was VERY clean. The owners(?) were there, and very friendly. My husband got a BLT and it was pretty good. I got the 'Awesome Salad' and it was anything but awesome. Chopped iceburg, DICED tomatoes, slices of mozzarella and what has GOT to be pre-packed quacamole (it tasted like rotten eggs) - all jammed into a clear plastic to-go container. 

I've never been so angry about a salad."}
{"text":"Wow!  Was recommended to go here from the csr at Hertz.  Good recommendation!  Great sandwiches and potato salad!!  Prices are good too!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches....for me it all about the bread.  Sourdough is my favorite and it is always super fresh!  I am also picky about my chicken salad but theirs is my favorite around the area.  Sometimes a little bit of a wait at lunch to get thru the line but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"5 stars for their lunch special consisting of my favorite sandwich: Hell's Kitchen and their awesome chocolate chip cookie.  

Their Hell's Kitchen sandwich comes with egg salad, avocado,and bacon!  So good it haunts me on a weekly basis.

Their chocolate chip cookie is once of the best I've ever had!  

Come for the lunch special; good price and perfect sized portion!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try a sandwich from this place for a couple of weeks now when I perused their menu online.  I found myself saying, \"That sounds sooooo good!\" after reading the description for every sandwich they offered.  It has been one heckuva week at work so I opted to treat myself to a to-go order from Heidi's.

The location is in a convenient spot right off Thunderbird with plenty of ample parking in a nice shopping center.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how clean it was and how good it smelled inside!  They bake their bread fresh every single day!  Not only that, but they take pride in the simple fact that they do NOT use nitrates, hormones, GMO's or antibiotics.  As I've gotten older, this has become a lot more important to me as it should to most everyone.  Additionally, all of the cheese they use is 100% certified organic and did I mention the fact that they bake their bread from scratch each and every day?  ...oh yeah, I couldn't remember if I mentioned that or not.

So anywho...  I opted for the hot salmon melt sandwich because not only did I want a hot sandwich after work today, but I love salmon.  [chanting] Omega 3's!  Omega 3's!  Omega 3's! [end chant]  So this behemoth of a sandwich comes fully loaded with a slab of peppercorn salmon, melted pepper jack cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, onions and their cajun sauce.  All of it was wedged in between two thick cut slices of homemade sourdough bread which was grilled / toasted to perfection.  The cheese sort of covered the salmon in a blanket of freshness and the veggies were crisp and fresh.  The sourdough bread wasn't terribly sour, but yet, it had a discerning enough taste that distinguished itself from regular french bread.  Sooooooo good!  The sandwich came with a pickle slice and a bag of potato chips (but you could also opt for potato salad or cole slaw).  Additionally, I paid a tiny bit extra for this gigantic brownie that was staring me eye level.  It was approx. the size of a tiny house... perhaps a little larger.  

My kitty attempted to eat some of my salmon so that's pretty much how I knew it was fresh.  After devouring my meal, giving it two thumbs up and reminding my kitty where her kibble is, I opted to jump right on Yelp and tell all of you awesome people about this review.  I would not hesitate in the slightest to recommend Heidi's Brooklyn Deli to any of my friends, family, co-workers or kitties for their phenomenal sandwiches!  Sadly enough, I've never been to New York and I have absolutely no idea what an authentic New York delicatessen tastes like, but I suspect, it looks and tastes something like this.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Sad blt sandwich I got from here. It was the first time my friends and I ordered from this deli and my sandwich was sad and disappointing. We had ordered delivery and it was pretty quick, but I know I won't be ordering from here again. I ordered a BLT on sourdough bread with potato salad. I literally got ONE piece of lettuce, one tomato, a few slices of precooked bacon pieces and small cuts on the bread of avocado. The potato salad is in a little side like ketchup container. And my meal was about $10. It's the worst sandwich I've ever seen/ had. Well, at least I know now."}
{"text":"Popped in for our lunch break. They have an awesome lunch special...$5 for a half sandwich, drink, cookie, and your choice of a side (potato salad, coleslaw or chips).

I was ravenous driving over and debated whether or not a half sandwich would cut it.  HOLY MOLY! This is the biggest half sandwich you will ever see.  This lunch special is truly a smoking deal!

I got a delicious sandwich called the new yorker: salami, cappicolla, provolone, avocado, lettuce and zesty cajun spread.  I chose an Italian hoagie for my bread.  The bread is baked fresh daily onsite.  You can choose from pumpernickel, sourdough, white, french hoagie, italian hoagie and so on.  It was fluffly and chewy, and fresh and awesome!  The meat was piled high.  Nothing skimpy about htis sandwich.  Really really good sandwich.  The cookie was chewy and delicious too.

The coleslaw sucks.  No thank you. 

We've already planned on going next week to try a new sandwich or wrap from the big menu.  There was quite a line when we arrived but they have lots of staff to move it pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"This is a great deli and the employees are very friendly. The sandwiches are great and the bread is very fresh. I haven't ordered anything that I didn't like here!"}
{"text":"Stopped by without checking reviews and should have walked out like I wanted to.  There were 2 employees who obviously did not want to be at work and the food was horrible.  Bread was old,  hotdogs were overcooked. ........ It was bad. The place was empty and all the prep tables looked out of food.  Maybe the place is about to close.  I don't know? !"}
{"text":"Very unhappy with my experience here...
Paid nearly $10 for a crappy italian sub that didn't even have cheese on it (I ordered it to go so I didn't realize this until I left). I ate the sandwich anyways and the meat on it was gross. It was worse than the ham bolognese mixture they serve at Subway.


Unfortunately I have to report that I think the lady making my sandwich left the cheese out on purpose...
I say this because while I ordered I asked if it comes with chips and a drink (For $10 IT SHOULD). She told me it only comes with chips. I then asked if I could substitute a drink for the chips and she replied with an irritated answer saying no we can't do that. I briefly tried reasoning with her that a drink would be cheaper to give than a bag of chips.. but still, no was the answer. I could tell she didn't like me even though I really wasn't being rude.. I asked nicely. 

I will never go back here again. I don't get how this place even stays in business."}
{"text":"Every sandwich is the BOMB! AMAZING homemade sour dough bread. I would suggest they use albacore for their tuna but other than that everything is super fresh. Best sandwich shop in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options. We beat the lunch rush by about 10 minutes so we didn't have any issues with service or wait times. I love that the lunch special comes with a little cookie and you can't beat two adult meals and a kids meal for under $20. Yay!"}
{"text":"Love coming here, the food is delicious!!! My personal favorite is #14 Cajun Turkey with avocado.  Today I tried something different #11 Transplanted New Yorker ( Italian sandwich) with red and green garlic peppers!! It was soooo good.  The service is great, the young lady that made my sandwich was helpful and friendly.  She help me change it up and pick the #11 which was a great choice. Their sandwiches are big and satisfying. Love it!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine why this place has any good reviews.  The workers are very unprofessional.  After each item that each person in my group ordered, the workers would elbow each other, whisper, and laugh.  The one girl rolled her eyes and whispered to the other, \"We ALWAYS have to tell people that,\" after I asked what kind of bread they have. It was obnoxious and offensive.  The food is not good.  The tuna salad is extremely sweet like it has a handful of sugar in it.  The floor and tables were all dirty.  The laughter was bizarre.  I've never been so uncomfortable trying to get a sandwich."}
{"text":"This is the home of my must have sandwiches! 1. Chicken Salad. 2. The new yorker.  3. The French dip.  A must try for #deli #sandwiches"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! Good food and friendly staff! Give them a try.
I had tuna salad with coleslaw and a pickle, I will return.  Everything was very good.   Place is clean too."}
{"text":"I have been by Heidi's so many times, but I never realized the greatness that was waiting inside. 

The layout was a little confusing, but I soon figured out that I needed to get up to the \"Order Here\" sign. The friendly staff helped me negotiate all my options in the menu. 

I had the Coney Island Reuben with a side of slaw and a pickle. I figured this was a run of the mill sandwich. I wasn't expecting the flavor awesomeness that came off that plate. The meat and the sauerkraut were balanced perfectly and the dressing accented the flavor, it didn't overpower it.

I am looking forward to my next visit, there are so many sandwiches left to try."}
{"text":"Great food - the Bronx Bomber was excellent, and everyone in our family found something they really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Great service. AMAZING sandwiches. My personal favorite: the spicy avocado turkey= soo sooooo good. Also, great $5 special- 1/2 sandwich, pickle, potato salad, cookie, and a drink. I just went to this place a few weeks ago for the first time, and now I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Deli meats were good. Ordered the club with turkey, ham, roast beef and bacon. They skimped on the turkey which was disappointing considering it was a $10 sandwich. Bread was fresh and service was good. I'd go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"When ever I'm on this side of town I always stop in for lunch. The Hell's Kitchen is my favorite. The staff is always kind and the place is very well kept."}
{"text":"Decided to come here since it was close to Hertz Rental and we were in the mood for deli sandwiches. I ordered the Genoa Salami and Provolone on Italian and they made it just right. It's a little expensive and the taste was pretty good but nothing amazing. I don't like that the combo only comes with 1 bag of chips (lays) and if you want a different kind, you have to pay extra. That's kinda weird and ridiculous in my book. We ordered a smoothie and it was okay. Not really any flavor and kind of bland. Kind of bummed me out but no biggie.

They have a big dining room with plenty of seating so that was nice. The customer service was friendly. Just a little too expensive."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had lovely experiences both times. Yesterday, my friend and I were in the area, and I suggested Heidi's. The line was long, but the employees were working fast. The sourdough bread, cut fresh for my sandwich, was still slightly warm from the oven. I added avocado (generous portion for only 50 cents) to my chicken salad sandwich. It was divine, and far more than I could finish, so I have my lunch for today as well!  Total cost with a drink was $9 and change... Not unreasonable at all. Employees were friendly and while the service was a bit slow, I'm convinced that good food takes time, so I'll wait and not get worked up over it. I will be going back to Heidi's every time I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Delicious and $5 dollar special is great! I like all of their sandwiches :-) My favorite is Cajun Turkey."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast bagel. Very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"It was okay. Not much to the sandwich for the price they charge. Macaroni salad wasn't the freshest. Rueben was no where near Coney Island style."}
{"text":"I was enthusiastic to try this deli because of the positive reviews, but one in particular made me nervous. I hate reading a review that has slammed a place because it makes me reconsider trying them in the first place. Me and my husband stopped here on the way  to run some errands. We had a great experience. 

It is clean and neat, with clear signs to help you order and a staff that is quick to acknowledge you and offer assistance. We enjoyed their personality. That gets a star. 

\"But the breads all taste like shit and are extremely doughy to the point of almost being wet, the meat is about as low-quality as I've ever tasted (think that $0.99 cent stuff you can pick up at the supermarket\" What? I mustn't have eaten the same sandwich. Okay, the meat might not be Boar's Head quality, but it's fresh and tasty. I would buy that meat at my supermarket if I were making my own sandwich. Good enough for me. And the bread... I like mine soft, not a baguette. It sure wasn't doughy or wet. Neither was my husbands. It was FRESH. The quality, though not 5 star or world class, is something I might use in my own home and this gets another star. 

\"Your side is a choice of a ramekin of either mac salad or potato salad or a bag chips - a super-small bag of regular Lays, regular Lays, or regular Lays.\" Um yeah. SO WHAT? Comparing them to Subway isn't fair here. Subway doesn't have potato salad, macaroni salad, or sliced pickles. They have chips. And I rather enjoyed the fact I didn't have to eat chips with my sandwich. I chose the potato salad. And it ROCKED. And for $5 my husband got chips AND a cookie. Their selection gets another star in my opinion. Bigger selection of meats, breads, cheeses, sandwiches, soups, breakfast sammys, etc. than subway. Let the chip thing slide. 

\"And why the hell can't I easily see the condiments available to be placed on the sandwich over the plexi-glass counter??? \" Know whats funny? I've been to capriottis. They have rave reviews. Can you see over the counter? No. 

\"The only thing healthy to get is a turkey or roast beef or something like that with mustard.  At least at Subway I can get a buffalo chicken sandwich or something like that with my choice of chips.\" Not really true here. Subway's bread is dried out and they aren't really THAT healthy. Their meat sucks. I had the New Yorker and it tasted BETTER than a buffalo chicken sandwich. And why are you so health conscious when you proclaim to need a selection of chips? No chips are healthy. Sorry. Heidi's doesn't fail. It rocks."}
{"text":"Great Deli. First time eating there. The food was fresh. Clean environment. Friendly staff and the line moved pretty fast. I am definitely coming here again. And lots of choices in there menu. My dish was great! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome find ! I wished they were open longer into the evening hours! The crab cake sandwich and Hells Kitchen sandwich are my two favorites ! Petra is awesome at meeting all your sandwich needs!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place it's too bad the one on Sahara closed down. This time around I had the BLT on sour dough with avocado. It was delicious!  It made me sorry for trading half of my sandwich for my husband's half of Tuna. I wasn't a big fan of the Tuna Sandwich it was a little too fishy and sweet for my taste. We both had the potato salad which had  big chunks of potatoes and just the right amount of mayonnaise. 

If you don't have a big appetite they have $5.00 deals on half of a sandwhich and a side. They also have fresh cookies and brownies here if you are craving something sweet!"}
{"text":"I will travel across town for the \"Hell's Kitchen Sandwich\", literally.... and, I have to, ever sense they closed the Charleston location.
It is seriously one of the best egg salad sandwiches I have ever had!
Your choice of fresh baked bread. I usually get wheat bread (toasted) then it is egg salad, bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado and an amazing Cajun sauce that is the key to the whole sandwiches success!!! 
Get the Hell's Kitchen Sandwich, you won't regret it! You may be addicted though... like me."}
{"text":"At first the atmosphere reminded me of Wildflower with the set up and seating but they make your sandwich to order right in front of you which takes a little while and can back up the line.  I love that you can see how they make it from scratch and event the bread is getting baked while your their.  They did tell me that the Hells Kitchen and Cajun Turkey with Avocado were their best sellers and it lived up to some pretty good hype.  I ordered the HK and wife had CTA, my HUGE sandwich has egg salad, bacon, cheese, avocado, and cajun sauce....WOW was this sandwich so fricken good that I ate the whole thing and that caused problems later for me.  The combination of all those ingredients is making me hungry right now but just dont eat the whole thing.  My wife loved her CTA and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch. Best crab cake sandwich around. The hells kitchen is also delicious. Always fast and friendly.."}
{"text":"I was having a \"me\" day today, and felt like getting a deli sandwich.  I was in the area, so I headed in their direction.  I got there about 2ish, so the lunch crowd had pretty much left.  The place had a few tables going, but for the most part, nice and quiet.  

The woman behind the counter was very nice.  She greeted me, and asked if I had any questions...I did have a few.  She answered with what I wanted to hear, so I proceeded to order.  I wanted a corned beef (not hot) on rye.  There were 3 options for rye, so I got the regular.  I had been here before, and sometimes they cut the bread slices way too thick for me, so I asked for thinner slices.  She showed me the cut, and got my approval.  All I wanted was the spicy brown mustard on it, with a side of slaw and a bottled water.

When I sat down, I couldn't wait to dig into my sammy...and it was sooo good!  The bread was incredibly soft and fresh, the corned beef was sliced thin and piled on perfectly and there was the right amount of mustard on it.  Their slaw is of the sweet variety, and I like to spoon a little bit on my sandwich as I take a bite...yummy!!!

My only complaint (if it really is one), I was sitting by myself, and would've liked to have the TV on.  I guess I should've asked, but I didn't."}
{"text":"I visited this deli for the first time tonight and was not highly impressed. I am not sure if the time I visited the deli was the reason for such low energy and bad cleanliness. 

When we walked in we were greeted by a filthy Oder but not greeted by the employees. Instead after standing in front of three workers for a few minutes they looked at us and said \"are you ready yet\". I would expect a little more personality and maybe a \"hi welcome to the deli, anything I can help you with?\"

I then noticed all the bread that they had on the cutting board was just sitting there, within inches of a trash can. Then I looked back and noticed the filth of this location throughout all the machines and the bottom metal racks holding the bread (which the bread was way too close to the ground) were disgusting and looked like they had never been washed.

So we order our food and the lady that helped us kept walking in circles, as if she was still learning the place.

So we get our food and sit down and I opened my coleslaw, or lack there of. The coleslaw smelt old and looked more like a mixture between a soup and potato salad. Then I went to bite into the sandwich and it was pretty good. The bread was good, the microwaved meat was sub par, overall the sandwich is the only reason why I give them 2 stars.

If they were to higher employees that enjoyed there job and had them spend less time talking to each other and more time actually cleaning the place it has potential. Also they should think about the layout as the way you order a sandwich is not inviting and confusing to some customers.

I am not sure if I am going to go back, but I wish them the best."}
{"text":"This was a spur of the moment decision on my way home the other night and it was one I do not regret. I was buying for my husband and myself, assuming we would do halfsies, so need two sandwiches. 

Having never eaten here before, I carefully read the entire menu and decided, to get a feel for the place, I would go old school, hot corned beef with mustard on marble rye, and new school, Cajun turkey with avocado on sour dough. I watched them slice my bread from big fresh loaves and proceed to construct the goodness. Let me say that turkey sandwiches typically do not thrill me, even with the addition of one of god's perfect food, the avocado, but when the dust settled, I admit that I would order the Cajun turkey over the corned beef (which was excellent) ANY DAY. It was spectacular!  The bread totally made these sandwiches! Soft and yet dense and BIG, it is worth a trip in just for that.

We also added an \"Awesome Salad\" (that was the name) with greens, cubed fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, red onion and more avocado. Name was pretty appropriate.  We will be back!

Actually, as I write this, it's 10 am and I am contemplating going back for another Cajun turkey... :)"}
{"text":"I like this place. I've only been here twice - both at lunch time - but I've been impressed both times. They have a $5 lunch special that you just can't beat. For said $5, you get half a sandwich, a small side (coleslaw/potato salad/mac salad), a pickle, a cookie, and a \"medium\" drink that's pretty damn big. Both times, I ordered the Pastrami sandwich on marble rye bread. Their pastrami has just the right amount of fat to make it delicious.

One day, I'll probably try something else on their menu. Or maybe I'll just end up ordering the same $5 special all the time. Why mess with a good thing?"}
{"text":"My buddy, originally from Brooklyn (and Jewish, so he knows his delis), warned me that this place was worthless.

I, against better judgement, decided to try it anyway.

The breads were done really well and the snacks were good (which is the only reason it got two stars), but the food itself sucked llama balls.

I barely finished my sandwich and threw out most of it. If I wanted to eat kraft singles, I'd buy it at the supermarket.

In the only way they could understand (since they are so \"brooklyn\"), FUCK YOU HEIDI AND YOUR FUCKING LOUSY WANNA-BE BROOKLYN DELI."}
{"text":"Favorite deli on the west side.  Don't leave witout trying the Hells Kitchen.  Their bread is amazing too!!!"}
{"text":"This is not the first time I've been to heidi's But I will be the first to admit she makes an absolutely amazing sandwich make sure you get there early before 1130 or late after 130 because if you get there at 12:30 expect to wait and wait they can make a sandwich fast But not that fast If you happen to be in the area great place to try all their sandwiches are absolutely delicious including their French dip their pastrami is great and they never hold back on the meat"}
{"text":"I'd say this is a nice little place to stop off for a quick sandwich. I haven't had any bad experiences the employees are friendly and the foods pretty good. It's nothing too different than your normal subway/Quiznos joint."}
{"text":"Do not advertise gluten free bread on your website and then not have it in your store!  We went there specifically for the gluten free bread!  The BLT was made with zap it in the microwave nasty bacon too!  Was not happy.  Guy who waited on me acted like it was my fault that they didn't have what I wanted to eat after they put it on the website.  I am not a fad dieter I am a Celiac and I look for restaurants that are closer to home that offer the foods I can eat.  Never going back there!"}
{"text":"the sandwiches/sides are not much better than grocery store deli

the staff were not friendly.  i don't care if this place is supposed to resemble new york.

the only thing the resembled new york was the bad attitude."}
{"text":"First off, I read reviews before visiting and it's ridiculous that people have given this joint less stars due to feeling uncomfortable with the employees laughing and having fun behind the counter when the place is empty.  If you are uncomfortable in your own skin, please don't whine about it on Yelp.  

Place wasn't too busy and wasn't too crowded.  The folks behind the counter were helpful when I asked a lot of question and they were friendly.  They didn't see bothered with me asking a lot of questions! 

The prices were fair for what I got, which was the eggplant parmigiana sandwich.  It was ok.  The marinara was rather plain and so, everything didn't have a lot of flavor overall despite the really good roll that it was on. 

I opted for potato salad which was just ok.  Personal preference, it needed just a dash of salt, which I added and it helped.  

Overall, I'd go back to try something else because the place has potential for greatness."}
{"text":"How does this place stay in business?!?!??!?! Worst service I have ever received! The person behind the counter Bob treats you like crap and makes you feel like you need to leave because your bothering him. If you have never been here and you decide to go make sure you don't run into him. He makes you feel stupid if you ask any questions on what they have to offer on their sandwhiches. I'm shocked this person still has a job here. Well I will never be back here and will make an effort to tell every person I meet about what an awful experience I had."}
{"text":"I got dragged here for lunch with friends and it was NOT a good experience. The place was a zoo, parking was atrocious, the soft drinks and cooler fruit juices and such were overpriced (even by Vegas standards), and good luck finding a seat. But when I got to the counter and had 3 orders screwed up because the staff couldn't listen to me I have a problem with that. When I asked them to fix their mistake and had to repeat myself 4 times, and then got an attitude back on top of that? Oh no! I won't be back. I don't do cattle call lunches where you mooove 'em in and mooove 'em back out the door. Do yourself a favor, find somewhere else to eat. 

The ONLY thing saving them from a place on my Absolutely Not list is that the food once they finally figured things out was edible. Boring, uninspired, blah, but edible."}
{"text":"I'll keep this as short as possible.

Everyone I know has told me how great this place is.

So I walk in yesterday with my friends at 5:10pm. First visit ever. 

As soon as we get to the counter, one of the sandwich guys loudly says \"Hey guys, we close at 6, so make it quick. We close at 6 and we need to be out of here AT 6.\"

There were two employees. One guy had a goatee. And the other guy didn't. The other guy is the one who said \"make it quick.\" 

This visit took place on Thursday March 20th at 5:10pm. 

\"Make it quick.\" Wow. Heidi's must be doing really well to turn down business 50 minutes before close.

Terrible first impression from an ungrateful worker. Never going back. If it was my store I would initiate documented coaching and if he had previous issues I would fire him."}
{"text":"Awful customer service, if you ask for cheese dont expect a drink!!! They are that stingy, even though they are already overpriced for the quality of service they provide."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place today.  The sandwich I got was super yummy.  Loved the French bread.  I will be returning.  To try the hells kitchen"}
{"text":"Heidi...I don't know if all deli's are like this in Brooklyn, if they are I surely don't need to visit then.  Very, very dull and boring inside with no pizazz at all.  I was hoping to emulate a NYC trip by coming here, but that didn't quite happen.  

The sandwich I had, the reuben with pastrami on rye bread wasn't too bad.  The meat and saurkraut were about average.  The highlight was the bread as it was very fresh and full of flavor.  At least they got something right here.

Overall I may or may not come back here.  I'm sure the place serves the lunch business crowd and that's what it's good for."}
{"text":"Not impressed, stopped in this past Sunday in hopes of finding a new go to deli/sandwich shop. The employee's not very friendly and really made you feel rushed, was there at 12:30 only four tables were occupied and every table was dirty! The hoagie roll is so hard it's not edible, the sour dough bread was really good has good flavor. The portions are small for what you spend the side of potato salad probably isn't even a teaspoon. Very bummed at this place, someone needs to clean it, old food on table and bottom of chairs and just gross. Dont think we will return"}
{"text":"Told me their recipe for Cajun sauce was just mayo, Cayenne pepper, and a bit of honey. Made it at home and its exactly the same! Good stuff! Now I don't have to eat it on a nuked sandwich. Bread is good but there is nothing Brooklyn about this deli. Everything is microwaved!"}
{"text":"After craving a french dip sandwich, we consulted Yelp. Good stuff. Feels like a go in, order and eat lunch, and leave. Nothing special, just food and a place to eat it. Clean, good service, and a menu with lots of variety"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find, just happened to drive bye and decided to give it a try and sooooo glad I did.
I got the number 24 the Coney Island and it's a home run
Piled high pastrami. Trust me give this place a try"}
{"text":"Walked in and didn't even get a hello from either of the guys behind the counter. One didn't even look at me almost the entire time while making my sandwich and checking me out. The other one eventually was very nice. 
Food was giant, hence the 2 stars, but taste was average. 
I've been wanting to try this place for a while and now I know it's just eh. I'll give it another try at some point and try one of the hot sandwiches just so I get the full feel of the menu. But this visit? Not impressed."}
{"text":"Always quality and fresh. I've even come in to buy french bread for spagetti at my house. The white bread is buttery and the egg salad....TO DIE FOR!"}
{"text":"First time here and WOW! Try the Cajun Crab sandwich, you won't be disappointed.  Absolutely our new favorite place to go for quality, fresh and flavorful food."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Clean. Reasonable price Convenient location of the 101 and TBird."}
{"text":"Ok so I ate here when I first stared my job. My boss suggested it and let me tell you. The bread is so good. I had the BLT and man oh man it was the Bomb.com. I'm actually craving it now. Thank baby Jesus it's pay day tomorrow"}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time but due to its generic exterior, I have not considered trying it until a friend recommended it to me. Overall, the service was lacking, what I purchased was overpriced, but the food was good enough to make up for the two other areas and I will definitely return. 

The flow of how and where they expect you to order is just confusing. You have to walk through a row of tables or walk against the flow of customers ordering to get to the spot where they want you to order. Once you get there, there is an awkward pillar right in front of the main menu. I found myself hovering to each side of the pillar looking at different parts of the menu. On top of all that, the sandwich makers stare you down until you start to order. I felt pressured to decide what I wanted immediately. I had very little time to ponder over my decision. Once you order, the flow of what to do next is uncertain for new customers. I walked across the counter to the register only to find out that the sandwich maker would hand me my sandwich back where I originally ordered. Then, I committed the sin of asking for baked chips and I was forced to walk across the store to pick those up. Oh and FYI they charge 69 cents extra for any chips that aren't original Lays. Once I got to the register the cashier did not offer me a small size drink. She showed me the medium and said, \"this size is okay right?\" I found that to be a little sketchy. Finally she was ready to ring up my order when another employee came up and started talking to the cashier about her schedule. The cashier didn't even say anything to me, stopped helping me, and talked to the other employee for about a minute. Eventually my order was rung up and I was able to sit down and eat.

Before I review the food itself, I want to briefly talk about the value of the food. I paid for both my girlfriend's and my meals. We each got a full sized sandwich, medium drink, and a side. The order totaled around $18. I feel that Heidi's is asking a little too much money for what you get. To be fair, they do offer a $5 special that includes a half sandwich, side, small drink, and a cookie. I wish there were other ways to upgrade to a meal without downgrading my drink, sandwich and being required to have a cookie. So basically if you want to buy into the only real good value in the store, you have to compromise in what you are getting. 

Flow, service, and value aside, the food was amazing. I ordered the Fresh Mozzarella Sandwich on (thick cut) wheat bread. The sandwich included mozzarella, tomato, balsamic vinegar, lettuce, onion, and a mouth watering pesto sauce. The sandwich reminded me of how some people act with crack, I just couldn't get enough. Even after I left the store, I kept wanting to go back and get another one. My girlfriend got the Chicken Salad Sandwich on wheat bread.  Her's was equally delicious. I can't wait to go back and try something new.

I gave Heidi's 4 stars despite the negatives I described in this review. I was really judging them during the ordering process, but once I sat down and bit in to my sandwich I was hooked. I believe if a restaurant has some flaws, the food can sometimes keep you coming back. That is definitely the case with Heidi's."}
{"text":"First time going there and being from Brooklyn I wanted a to try it. Got a breakfast bagel put thru that open toaster twice eggs were microwave scrambled and ham was too. Sandwich ended up super soggy n tasteless. And the fruit smoothie was ok but no choice to mix different fruits. I don't eat bananas and every smoothie except for maybe one contained bananas i asked if i could switch bananas for strawberries the unfriendly lady making my order said I couldn't because the fruit is pre packaged as they are on the menu. NOT A TRUE BROOKLYN DELI AT ALL! Should definitely be more BROOKLYN where everything is made on a hot grill or hot plate and made to your liking and your ingredients. New Yorkers are pretty picky and particular with their food and how it is cooked. Seriously they should take the Brooklyn off their name! And really train their employees on better customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Place is perfect. Soup and sandwiches. Try the hells kitchen egg sandwich. Packed with flavor and great price for the combo. Love it"}
{"text":"Good deli food, large sandwiches, very small sides. Good, friendly service. We came between busy times, and tables were not clean. Decor is blah. I had the Rueben and it was good. My buddy had the Hell's Kitchen, basically an egg salad sandwich on steroids. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Heidi's is a great spot for lunch. There chicken salad sandwich is so yummy. They have an awesome special as well."}
{"text":"Honestly as long as you order it to go and skip the entire line it's not bad at all! I usually get the Italian sub, it's better quality than subway. Don't get anything other than side chips, because you'll end up with a dinky cup of anything else. It's def. not a place I would go to for lunch regularly.."}
{"text":"Delicious! A decent, healthy meal for only $7- half a sandwich (still good size), soup, a pickle and a side. The staff was really friendly and the cookies are to die for. Definitely glad I found this place today!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Heidi's for the first time and it was great. They had a white board with the day's special written on it: a chicken salad sandwich that came with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato and onion, your choice of a side, potato salad, coleslaw, or chips, and a fountain drink for $5.95! What a great deal! We asked the girl working if she liked the chicken salad and she replied that she did not like it because they use honey in it. I appreciated her honesty and got it anyway, I like honey! The chicken salad was great! Certainly not what I expect chicken salad to taste like, but delicious. I chose to have it on pumpernickle bread, which they bake fresh. I decided on potato salad for my side. It is made with red potatos and tasted good but the portion was very small! Now that I know how tiny the side portions are, I will always get a bag of chips instead.
I am excited to go back and try some real deli classics and see what else they offer for cheap daily specials!"}
{"text":"I must say I was not impressed. One surly afternoon I found myself in a rut, nothing seemed to be going right. I decided that I needed some New York Deli (I know, random right?) I pulled out my trusty iPhone and proceeded to search for a Jason's or McCallister's, but to no avail. It just so happened that I was also in need of the services of my local post master, so as I drove to the post office I came across Heidi's New York Style Deli, coincidence? Fate? Happenstance? I proceeded inside. I ordered the hot pastrami on marbled rye and a chefs salad for the Dutches of Surprise (my wife) this is when everything began to unravel. My first clue that I was headed on a path of disappointment was when the pleasant young lady proceeded to place my sandwich in the microwave, pause for dramatic effect... I guess it was my fault for asking for a \"hot\" pastrami. The next disappointment came when the lady handed me my salad dressing in a pouch, a pouch! Deli? No, New York style? No, Authentic? No, Heidi's? I don't even know anymore :("}
{"text":"Love this sandwhich place! The bread is fresh and so are the deli and the veggies. I usually order the turkey special, which for $7 comes with a drink and a choice of side, chips or potatoe salad, or maccaroni salad. I usually just get the chips, because the other stuff were too small. But all still a great deal!

Staff is great always service with a smile. This is on my top lunch list! :)"}
{"text":"I work in the same business park as this joint....  Its seems to be quite popular being crowded at lunch.  I ordered the pastrami reuben.  It was 6.99 comes with a side and dill pickle.  The bread is freshly made daily on site.  The sandwich was decent, nothing to come onto yelp and rave about...  It was a nice sized sandwich, I wouldnt say over stuffed but filling. In conclusion, this place is ok, not great, but is there really a great deli in Vegas...  Location makes it easy for me to grab a lunch and will try other things...  I would be mainly for convience not for the great taste...  I would tell friends to try it, perhaps they will find it to be better than me.   Hope this YELPS....


7/14/12
I tried the tuna,, it was okay, the portion wasn't that big.  I am sure many of us could make a better tuna salad than these folks..  The bread being fresh is very good.  I paid 6.99 for a tuna on white, includes a bag of chips or a mouthful of some salad... My recommendation,, buy some albacore mix it up yourself... Skip the tuna at this place or go go the subway, it tastes the same... Hope this yelps"}
{"text":"Visited Heidi's for the first time yesterday with my co-worker during lunch break. I'm not really a sandwich person but she wanted to try it so I agreed. I choose the ham and cheese club sandwich and it was pretty good, big sandwich, lots of meat. The only downside was the avocado was more of a spread and I wasn't a fan of that. I will probably be back to try something else as they have plenty of variety."}
{"text":"I just didn't like it.  I ordered a wrap.  It was pretty bland, and the meat wasn't very high in quality... not that I expected for it to be all that great, but come on.  Worst of all, I ordered soup on the side.  The guy put the little bowl on the plate with my wrap and proceeded to spill soup all over the plate.  My wrap was all soggy (like, soaked... he missed the bowl and poured a whole ladle of soup on it), but he refused to make me a new one.  He said, \"oh, it will be fine\" and acted like I was being fussy.  Whatever.  I just won't go back."}
{"text":"This was the first time I ever tried this place. The chicken Parmesan sandwich was absolutely disgusting, so horrible that I threw up the one bite I had taken in their bathroom. The chicken literally tasted as hard as a rock and it was awful. Once mentioned to the staff they seemed to not even care or even apologize. I definitely don't recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"If you go away hungry at Heidi's you must have a tapeworm. I liked this restaurant. They make their own bread, have a lot of combos for sandwiches. I had a half chicken salad wrap and minestrone soup. I had never had a wrap before and didn't really care for it. But that's me. I think there was at least a half pound of chicken salad in it. I thought the soup was watery. I am definitely going back to try something more amazing! The service was excellent (smiling faces) and patience. Very clean. The only real problem was the acoustics. When it started getting busy the smoothie machine blasted through any conversation you were having. I will write again when I return, and that will be soon! Yes I have been back a few times!  The Italian sub is awesome! I can't put my mouth around it! It is huge! Lots of different meats, I have to say I like shredded lettuce better than leaf because it marinates the oil and vinegar so much better and I also order the banana peppers on it for spunk! Enjoy"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful.  They even take fax orders. Food is fantastic and convenient.  Thanks to all the staff at Heidi ' s for making my co-workers and I very satisfied while working on Sunday."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and awesome potato salad. I love the Hells Kitchen sandwich and have eaten pretty much almost everything on the menu (they were close to work).  Wish there were more breakfast items and that they made a grilled cheese sandwich for adults instead of it being on just the kids menu.

Unfortunately, they have poor delivery service. Wrong orders and paper found in food. 

Go eat there, just eat there!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. First time going in and the lady at the counter answered all of our questions and went out of her way to tell us the most popular and gave us samples. Got our food and oh my, you can taste the quality in every bite. From the incredible homemade sourdough to the egg salad. I will 100% be coming back."}
{"text":"Dear Heidi, good stuff! If you were an actual chick I would marry you. 

I order from this place fairly often. Pretty sad, the dude that answers knows my voice. I'm obsessed with their Hell's Kitchen sandwich. Instead of spending 3 1/2 hours making an egg salad sandwich, like Andy from 40 yo virgin, I hit this spot up.  My friend Phoogie said it best, \"It has to be official! I mean, Tom from Myspace, Yelped  about it\". 
On occasion, they will decide what you SHOULD get in your sandwich rather than what you ordered (there's a running joke at work about it). I'm not trippin', because their sandwiches are that good.  If you order in, you will not have that problem."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now. Their sandwiches and salads are really good. I can't really speak for their soups because I've never had them. The staff is always friendly and the location has always been really clean when I go eat there. I love the fact that they deliver, but plan on expecting your food to arrive at least an hour after it has been ordered."}
{"text":"The place used to be ran by some young guy who has no business or management skills.   I understand his father is the money and brains behind the operation, but throws a bone to his son by letting him run it.   I think the place would probably be pretty good if someone that was qualified to run a business (like the father) would actually make the business decisions.  Food is overpriced, and its odd how they close the store whenever they want.  It's like they have no set hours."}
{"text":"This is the best deli around! The bread is to die for and the meats are always fresh and delicious! The people are always super friendly and happy! If you want the best sandwich in the whole city, try Heidi's
I like when JAMIE is behind the counter as she ALWAYS makes the sandwiches with a ton of love!"}
{"text":"My wife called me on her way home and asked if she should stop at Heidi's instead of JJ's to pickup dinner. I was raised in BROOKLYN so I was anxious to try it.

She got the roast turkey and I got the Transplanted New Yorker.  We also got a Spiced Apple Cider cake cookie, samples of the potato salad and cole slaw.   

The bread was fresh and we both liked them.  The Transplanted New Yorker cajun sauce definitely had some heat.  My wife loved the potato salad & cole slaw.

Our daughter loved the cookie.   Super Fresh, Super Moist, Super Delicious."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are amazing.  We had a catering for a night of long IT work and ordered from Heidi's all the different sandwiches we could figure.   Great thick bread, delicious meats and fresh vegetables with fixings and a pickle!  NOM NOM NOM!"}
{"text":"The food was good (Italian sausage and peppers), but the 5 star was for the service.  The gentleman behind the counter was so nice and friendly with my toddler son! Gave us free apple juice, chips, and a sucker for my little guy.  Dining room was clean... we will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely best service ever! Great employees. Great management. Very pleased with the sandwich and soup. I had the Cajun Turkey with tomato basil soup. Prices are definitely good for the amount you get. Fast service, delicious food, if you haven't been here I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Somewhere in my brain I have a magnet that attracts me to deli's. I'm sure part of that stems from growing up in New York.  Like the \"best\" pizza and the \"best\" hamburger, different folks have wildly differing ideas about what the \"best\" deli should be. To me it's nothing more than a simple formula for serving real meats, cheeses and breads in generous quantities and not straying too far from the generally accepted way deli food should be prepared. A deli restaurant is not a place to experiment with nouvelle, haute, froo-froo, or any other artsy way of playing around with my food.  Some people judge a deli by its ambience and service ... those people have obviously never been to a real NY deli.

So today, making a rare venture to the west side of town because that's where my doctor just built a new office I was hungry and Yelped for something nearby that was NOT a fast food chain. Good luck with that in this neighborhood!  But this place popped up and it looked promising.  I didn't read the reviews nor did I visit their website, I just took a chance.

In true west-of-the-Mississippi style they are located in a strip mall. As soon as I walked in the place reeked of \"chain\" ... you can always tell by the signage and standardized cooking appliances.  But it didn't look like a big chain and sure enough I found out later that they only have 18 locations (13 of them in Colorado).  So my anti-chain reaction mechanism didn't set off any alarms, to me that few locations still qualifies as mom and pop.

The interior is standard issue strip mall, but remember I don't judge a deli by its ambience. The people working behind the counter are quasi-friendly leaning toward a general impression of looking a little bored. But I was there right after lunch and a lot of places start looking a little haggard right after their lunch crowd. But remember I don't judge a deli by its service ... if I did I would never step foot into any deli again in my life.

So, how was the food?  I had one of my favorite sandwiches, a Reuben.  A place has to try really hard to screw up a Reuben!  This one at Heidi's wasn't bad. At only $8.75 it had about as much pastrami (at my request) in it as I could buy for $8.75 at my local supermarket. The bread was fresh and traditional rye tasting and the entire sandwich was satisfying in taste.  I chose coleslaw as my side. That's where so many delis utterly fail but here it was pretty good. The slaw was crisp so it didn't taste like it came out of a food service container and overall it looked and tasted fresh.  The dill spear wasn't anything special, just an ordinary Vlasic or similar pickle out of a jar.  To me one sign of a deli who is really serious about being a real deli is one that puts some time and care into their dill pickles, it doesn't have to cost them more (in fact it can cost them less if they make their own) but if the pickle isn't memorable the whole meal suffers.

The bottom line is that Heidi's Deli isn't great, isn't bad and there's no reason I wouldn't go back. As far as a non-East-Coast deli it's better than average. I suggest they work on their pickle and maybe get a little more efficient about the way they run the customer counter, which right now is a bit confusing and disorganized."}
{"text":"One of my favorie lunch spots of all time. I do go to their new Gibson location, but this one is just as good, albeit not as new.

I love their vegetarian selections--especially their lox sandwich. Everything is fresh and delicious. I've never had a better or more unique sandwich. Prices are reasonable, service is great and atmosphere is as good as it gets for a lunch sandwich shop.

I love this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE sandwiches and this is by far my favorite sandwich place!!!  There is enough meat on one sandwich for at least 4 Footlong sandwiches at subway!  Fresh bread, veggies and an overall pleasant experience.  The people are always friendly.  I wish there was one in the East Valley!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here there's something new that annoys or upsets me. I used to love Heidi's at a different location, but unfortunately it closed. I've since gone to this spot 3 times and every time I have left dissatisfied with the service and the cost. I won't be coming here again. They seem to make up specials on the spot. I bought a half-sandwich meal and then 3 weeks later I was told that I couldn't get my sandwich in a half-sandwich meal since 3 years ago. I literally had it within the past month though. The old guy behind the counter has the worst customer service I've seen in a long time and the bang-for-the-buck factor is completely gone from Heidi's. Maybe if I hadn't gone there when it was better priced, I would have a different opinion. It's just not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - Quality - One thing I love about Heidi's is their quality. They bake their bread right there and have a wide selection. Their meats are fresh and delicious.
       - Portion - The other thing about Heidi's sandwiches is that they're big. Thick slices of bread, Large helpings of meat.
       - Price - Most sandwiches are around $8. All sandwiches come with a small side. There's also a deal during lunch for half a sandwich, chips, and a drink for $5.
**Favorites**
       - Transplanted New Yorker - Sinfully fatty deli meats with avocado and their signature secret cajun sauce. Every bite is deliciously salty and spicy.
       - Bronx Bomber - Pastrami and egg salad. I usually add their cajun sauce to this to seal the deal. If you like pastrami and egg salad, you have to get this. Be warned however, this is a pretty large sandwich and you are in danger of a food coma after wards.
**Recommendations**
       - I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quality sandwich."}
{"text":"I wish I had read some of the reviews from my Yelp friends because in retrospect they give good advice.

I was baffled at why my sandwich went up in price, if I read Ryan S.'s review I would have known my cheese was extra. I was looking everywhere to see if they had a lunch special, if I read Paolo D.'s review I would have known about the half sandwich, side, pickle, cookie and drink deal for $5. The moral of the story is that literacy is important and the corn beef is tasty.

I got the fore mentioned meat on pumpernickel with coleslaw, pepperjack, mustard, tomatoes, onions,and mustard.  Heated and toasted is the way to go. The corn beef is moist without an ounce of fat connected to it. Surprised, but delighted. The bread are baked fresh and they definitely taste like it. All sandwiches comes with a side of coleslaw, potato, or macaroni salad and a pickle spear. For $8.09, my sandwich was delicious and filling. 

They move quick and it is easy to get lost in the shuffle. Be ready and get there a little before noon because the line gets long."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop in vegas! Not only are the prices great, but the bread and cookies are baked fresh daily. The staff does their job, not the most bubbly of personalities, but no complaints because they make amazing sandwiches and arent rude either :) the only downfall is that they close at 5 pm everyday, and closed on Monday's :("}
{"text":"I go here quite a bit for lunch as its relatively close to my work and I refuse to eat Subway ever since I found out they have hi-fructose corn syrup in their bread.   Well I read that on the internet (along with stuff about hi-fructose corn syrup being bad) so it has to be true right?  The Internet would never steer me wrong.

I tend to stick with the Salmon Melt on Wheat with no cheese and light spread.  It's basically some precooked chunks of smoked salmon which are recooked and placed on the bread, avocado and the veggies you choose and then smothered in some spicy sauce.  The process of the salmon would normally bother me but then I realize I'm paying $8.99 for it and a bag of chips and it's quite tasty so I get over it quickly.   I really like the wheat bread here, and with the salmon melt they usually give two extremely thick pieces of it (I'm thinking they might do this to better stabilize the toppings.   I've had other cold sandwiches and the pieces of bread haven't been thick.  Could all just be a giant coincidence if you believe in those)   There have been a few times I forgot to hold the cheese and I braved through it lactose intolerance notwithstanding.   Naturally it was even better with the pepperjack cheese smothering everything in between the bread.   Reason #5156 why I hate my life.  

I've also tried the Cajun Turkey with Avocado sandwich, as well as their roast beef.   I found both of these to be worthwhile of a visit as well but overall not as good as the Salmon Melt.   Service is always okay, though it does sometime seem rushed.  A giant line of people is a good enough reason for me to explain that, so no points deducted on that one.  We've also tried delivery a few times without any issues (quick and efficient)

Overall I can't find much fault with making Heidi's a lunchtime decision, especially over Subway.  Now I eagerly await someone to let me know Heidis uses hi-fructose corn syrup in their avocado, or to send me a youtube link to corn farmer propaganda on the health benefits of hfcs.   Get at me."}
{"text":"They asked me if I wanted my sandwich heated and immediately threw it in the microwave and then wanted me to pay $10 for it.  After looking around for hidden cameras to see if I was being punked I declined the meal and went next door and got great Gyro."}
{"text":"Awesome! Went there, the knew how to say Italian words the right way and not Americanized. Brought home a corned beef sandwich, and the break was still soft and delicious not hard as a rock like others places I've brought a sandwich home from. Just the right amount of spicy mustard. So good.  Highly recommended. Delicious"}
{"text":"I used to grab a sandwich from here on my way to night class. Thinking it was over ten years ago, and they're still there here makes me happy. Menu is the same and it tastes exactly how I remember it. The fresh homemade bread just makes it for me."}
{"text":"Kids and I have been here multiple times. Love their sandwiches. Haven't had a bad one yet."}
{"text":"This place is awesome... I happen to work next door and we order lunch from there all the time, Well maybe i should say ordered lunch from there all the time, There was some sort of drama or something and the place was forced to shut down... The sandwiches were delicious and the soup amazing, the staff was very friendly and will be missed... The prices were more than fair for the massive sandwiches they served up.. Sad to see the place go."}
{"text":"I'm seriously obsessed with this place. Whenever I come to Vegas I make my friends go with me like 5 times. The chicken salad is the best ever. And I saw someone say that she was upset that her bread was so thick but they slice each piece as they need it and there's a sign that says to ask for your bread sliced thin so if that's what you're about, just ask them."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast sandwich - egg, bacon, pepper jack cheese on a jalopeno bagel! I loved mine, but my 15 yr old daughter was unimpressed with her roasted turkey on wheat. She just said it was boring. It needed some pizazz. 

This probably doesn't need mentioning, because this was our first time at Heidi's, but the place wreaked of some sort varnish or something.  They said it was from the place next door that was under construction. I was simply disgusted with the smell. Almost had to leave.

The food was good though and I'll be back for more, and to see if it always stinks of something other than deli food."}
{"text":"I eat here once a week for lunch. Always good food, fast and service as well. Not going to say they aren't friendly but a few of the employees struggle to smile. Not uncommon to see lines with 12+ people in it at lunch time. Always see the police and firefighters eating here as well so that should tell you it's good. Good menu with lots of options. Only wish they had a few other options for sides. Soups are very good as well. I had he chicken noodle and it was very good. I always get the Hell's Kitchen sandwich which I struggle to finish. It's a big sandwich. I would give it a 5 star if I saw more smiles and felt a little more welcome. However there is an older gentleman here who always wears a cardinals hat and he is super friendly, always smiles and makes small talk. He looks like he enjoys work. Overall a really good deli with good sandwiches."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled veggie on their french hoagie bread. They microwave the eggplant with cheese to melt the cheese...it made the eggplant chewy with the skin inedible...They definitely need to rethink the way they do things."}
{"text":"I'm from the North East and just moved to Peoria.  I'm 4 months pregnant and had a craving for an authentic hot pastrami sandwich.  A co-worker of mine recommended Heidi's and picked us up a cpl sandwiches.  I fell in love!  It was the best hot pastrami sandwich a pregnant woman could ask for! However, I got the craving again about a week later and accidentally arrived 10 minutes before closing.  The gentleman outside that greeted me was very kind and said that the girls inside would take care of me.  Well, first I sincerely apologized for coming in so last minute, but instead of assuring me it was ok the one girl that assisted me just stared at me and told me that their menu was limited at this time.  So I asked about the hot pastrami sandwich and she said that she could do that.  My sandwich was anything but hot.  She gave me my bag and I felt the bread and I asked her if it was the hot pastrami sandwich and she sighed, rolled her eyes and told me that they don't heat the bread.  I took her word although I distinctly remember my very first one from there being hot all the through even by the time that it reached me at my work.  I asked her if I could order a larger potato salad side, but she said all they could sell me was the little side one for like $2 something AND she forgot my pickle.  To a pregnant woman, that's a big deal.  Anyway, I got home to find out that my sandwich wasn't heated at all, not even the meat was attempted to be heated.  It was pretty much a cold cut sandwich and I was extremely disappointed in the quality of my food and customer service and will not be returning.  I told my co worker and he won't even go back there.  Too bad."}
{"text":"I found this place through my fiance a few years back and try to mix things up.  So much so, I totally forgot to come back aside from our binge fest then.  

I have tried the prosciutto, hell's kitchen and Brooklyn bomber in the past, all of which were amazing.  Prosciutto is awesome always and not much needs to be said about it.  The Brooklyn bomber consists of pastrami and their homemade egg salad and the heels kitchen is the sane except bacon, I believe.  This time, I went with the Coney Reuben with half corned beef and half pastrami.  It was pretty tasty, except for the fact that they have gotten pretty skimpy on the meats since I last remember.  That is a category that should never be sacrificed.  I added a side of naked beans and a pickle is always thrown in for good measure.

The establishment that I went to was the location in Charleston.  The interior is very well kept and spacious with an efficient use of space.  The only thing is that there order line starts from the right to the left.  The staff is friendly as always and the location I visited on Eastern have that East coast feel with New York and Jersey accented staff.  This location, not so much.  

There is a vast variety of menu items to choose from though. Anything from breakfast, soup, sandwiches (cold/hot), salads and even smoothies.  I have yet to try everything and noticed that they have specials including half sandwich and soup combinations.

Initially, I would have given this place a 4 star rating, but with the influx of decent sandwich shops sprouting up everywhere, I would have to kick it down a notch just because of the far from generous portion of meat added to my meal.  I wanted to pay for a $7+ sandwich, not too mention I always tip, so expect to be rewarded...somewhat.  I hope my next visit is better."}
{"text":"What more can you ask for in a sandwich shop?  Fresh bread baked daily, super fresh ingredients, a friendly staff that likes to banter with customers and the best damn pickles in the city.  All this for under 10 bucks with no fuss or long wait.  100% recommend this place anytime you want a great sandwich."}
{"text":"I do not know what an authentic Brooklyn deli is like but this place has some good fresh food and nice employee's. I always get the Country Dijon egg salad and I am never disappointed. I have had others, the turkey and a salad which both tasted great. I have never had a complaint about the food, every time the it tastes great. 

The price is higher than Subway or Port-o-subs, but I can get my egg salad for less than $7 and I think it's great! 

The do enjoy eating there because its quiet and relaxing. This place I visit at least once a week!"}
{"text":"3 of 4 previous reviews made sure to mention one key component of this menu- avocado. It makes quite an impression on people i guess. On me, meh...

The wife was at the dentist getting mangled , so i popped over to the deli after a dog walk at the Ohio Erie canal park(BOOOOORING...) I was totally in the mood for a breakfast burrito or some sort of eggy sandwich. But as an almost vegetarian of many years, my brain is hardwired to respond to the \"veggie\" option. Even if it's not what i went in for. 
Ordered the veg croissant. No croissants. Okay, how about a bagel? Done. It had AVOCADO(very creamy to the point of being liquid), cream cheese, sprouts, tomato and a sort of zippy hot sauce. A real mess to eat, but marginally tasty. Also had a cup of joe. Total was just north of 5 bucks. Cheap, but the bagel was sort of unfulfilling and i had to pig out when i got home an hour later.

They have tons of sandwiches(including my next visit's choice, the Cajun Crab Cake), salads, wraps and a couple soups. They also have a fresh smoothie menu. Very friendly folks. Sort of bland decor, but quite convenient for all Independence office slaves. Worth a visit if you are sick of everything else on Rockside(Bob Evans, Chipotle, McDonald's, BP). Skip the canal, it blows."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch as i work pretty close. My go to is a chicken salad wrap with sprouts. It is a great chicken salad.And it costs about 7 dollars.There soups are good too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch on the way through town. We were not disappointed. I had a salmon sandwich #35 and my mom had the BLT. I grabbed a berry smoothie to go. Delicious food, fast & courteous service and this place is very clean."}
{"text":"not impressed ...for the price very little meat and and tasted disgusting.... they heat the meat in microwave right in front of you which probably means not fresh...bread cut so so small and no greeting what so  ever from the employee..looked at me like why are you here with no smile at all. i ordered a ruben and after one bite i threw it away. will never go back waste of money..."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and food is very bland . Steer clear of the egg salad it tastes like food you would get at a old folks retirement center.

I'm almost certain they are here to
Cater to the senior community they are afraid of salt. The sandwich I had tasted nothing like the description. I was trying to be nice but I might want to add my sandwhich was also soggy when it arrived. They did nothing to fix it and offered to correct it the next time why would I order again if they mess up so bad the first time"}
{"text":"This is mainly a review on their work stations...from food service to food service...they need to label their food with expiration dates. I took a peek at their small reach in fridge and saw a whole bunch of stuff that was labeled or dated...that's a pet peeve at my work! Also, that's a food safety issue."}
{"text":"Great Rubin. Less fat and grease because they oven heat it to melt the cheese and crisp the marble rye. The meet quality was on point. Topped off with a cream soda!"}
{"text":"I love this little spot. I remember when they  had a Gibson Rd. location and I used to frequent. My  favorite is the Hell's Kitchen. It's basically an egg salad sandwich and a BLT combined with a hint of cajun mayo  spread. SO GOOD!  if i could make the drive at lunch break I  would go every day. I wish they  had more locations, but when I go it's never that  busy , so maybe they  dont see the need :/"}
{"text":"This is the best off the strip sandwich spot period. I've been here many times on my lunch break and the line is always long after noon, for obvious reasons. Delicious sandwiches, fresh ingredients and fresh cooked bread. All sandwiches come with your choice of  FRESH daily in house cooked bread which includes the following: Ciabatta, Butter-Top White, Light-Rye, Pumpernickel, Marble-Rye, Sour Dough, Whole Wheat, French Hoagie, Italian Hoagie.

They have an awesome lunch special, for $5, you get half a sandwich, a small side with your choice of Coleslaw or Potato Salad, a cookie and a drink. I usually order the Heidi's club on Whole wheat with Turkey & Bacon with Avacado, Sprouts, Lettuce, Mayo & Onions....Always fresh ingredients.  

**Favorite Sandwiches: Egg Salad & Heidi's Club on Whole Wheat with Turkey & Bacon.

**Sides: Coleslaw (And I'm not a fan of coleslaw, but their coleslaw is pretty damn good!). Potato Salad (LOVE IT) 

**Oh yea, Heidi's has great vegetarian options as well, all of their Vegetarian choices have a Green Star in front of them"}
{"text":"This place is so damn good! I have tried several sandwiches, wraps and salads and all of them were good. I drove by this place for about 4 years before I stopped on and wish I would've stopped earlier. Gf came here with some coworkers about 9 months ago and we have been coming here ever since. Cajun sauce is on point!!!!"}
{"text":"I really love the sandwiches here. Most of the time I go there, the service is quick and the people are very nice. The past 2 times I have gone there though, there is a girl working behind the counter who just has the worst customer service attitude I've ever seen. The first time I had her making my order, I she was really surprised at what a bad attitude she had but brushed it off as maybe she was just having a bad day? Then yesterday, we went there again. The minute she walked out to see my husband and I standing there she literally looked visibly upset/bored of the fact that she had customers. It was pretty much empty inside, there was only about 5 other people sitting down eating, we were the only ones  in line the entire time we were in there. She then asks in a completely flat voice what we want. As she's making my sandwich she puts on a noticeably thin layer of mayo, I ask if I can please have a bit more mayo put on, she looks up at me and says \"there's packets of mayo over there you can use.\" The look she had on her face and the way she said it wasn't a suggestion or spoken kindly. It was flat out rude. As we're checking out I notice the sign that says 10% off if we check in on Facebook, so as I'm doing that my husband lets her know so she can apply the discount. She replies \"OH PERFECT!\" In a way over-the-top way like she was mocking us or something? My husband and I just looked at each other a little confused as to why the attitude? Then as we're walking out the door my husband remembers he forgot to ask for a small side of his favorite sauce that he orders every single time we eat there. He asks her and she gives him the most dirty look, practically rolls her eyes at him and says \"Sure.....\" she then gives him the most tiny amount of sauce in a little to-go cup I've ever seen. If she had nicely said, \"sure I can totally get that for you, but just letting you know I do have to charge you for it!\", that would have been 100x more acceptable than the attitude she gave us. We'll pay for the extra sauce any day over that kind of response. The entire time we were there (both times) she has not once smiled or made us feel welcome. I was a waitress for 4 years and I know that working in a restaurant can be tough, but to smile or have basic respect for people goes a long way. I really don't want to go to Heidi's again just because of these 2 experiences and the lack of basic kindness/customer service. She is the taller, young lady with brown hair that is usually in a ponytail or bun. I really hope management takes care of this issue because we have come to love your sandwiches and really enjoy your other employees. Normally I wouldn't write such a harsh review of someone but it's really obvious that she does not want to be there and she is causing your customers to feel the same way."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were out and about in need of lunch and in the mood for something not too heavy as it was a hot day. At the suggestion of my Sister and fellow Yelper Alana M. we decided to check this sandwich shop out upon reading her review. 

I decided on the \"Cajun turkey w/avocado\" I chose sourdough bread as my choice. My sandwich came with a pickle and choice of salad, I opted for coleslaw which was very good with a sweet horseradish kick. My sandwich was delicious, generous with the juicy moist turkey, a layer of cajun mayo sauce, and avocado slathered with lettuce, purple onion and tomato. The bread was fresh and soft, this sandwich literally melted in my mouth and it was a cold sandwich lol. Mmmmm not a skimpy sandwich, very filling, fresh and tasty!

My boyfriend decided on the \"Bronx Bomber\" pastrami and egg salad, he chose rye bread. He opted for potato salad as his side and he truly enjoyed that sandwich!

They bake their bread fresh daily, they have the loaves displayed, as you select your choice of bread they slice it before preparing your sandwich. 

The service is great, friendly employees! 

They have hot and cold sandwiches, salads, wraps, soups, bagels, smoothies, ice cream and shakes as well as a few breakfast sandwiches. 

We will be back to try other menu items as well.

*They also deliver for a $2 charge."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are decent but the customer service is poor.  The man taking my order and making my sandwich was rude - yelling at me from across the restaurant - After I left, I called to speak with the manager to let them know about my experience today.  They would not let speak with one and would not provide a name. He said he would not give that out to me over the phone.  I don't expect a lot when I am getting lunch to go - just a pleasant interaction and a good meal.  Too bad I will not be back."}
{"text":"I have 2 favorites, the hot dog and the pastrami with mustard.  The service is fast, the team is the friendly and a pleasure to talk to.  They have great tasting vegan wheat bread, smells great when right out of the oven.  Soft and yummy.  You should give it a try."}
{"text":"I discovered this deli first while at a layover in Denver.  It was such a good size and reasonable price for any food at the airport.  At this location, it was the same.  I ordered the smoked turkey with extra veggies and sprouts.  Delicious.  Especially compared to the Quiznos turkey sandwich we had at the Denver airport the next day, which was lacking much of any filling."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me this morning with a Lox Bagel from Heidi's Deli! I was so excited because this is my favorite breakfast! I bit into this sandwich and was so extremely disappointed to find it was at LEAST a 3 day old bagel. The edges of this bagel were so hard it was inedible. We live very close to this deli and every time we've been there (3 times in two years!) I am disappointed.  Won't be disappointed again as we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I stopped in on the recommendation of a friend. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. I ordered their \"sub\" sandwich and for $7 this thing is pretty big, I'm a big guy and could barely finish it. It also came with choice of chips, potato salad or something else that I can't remember (sorry), and a crisp pickle slice. 

I chose the potato salad and really enjoyed it quite a bit. I'd almost go as far to say that I'd go back just to get more. As for the sandwich it was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but the ingredients were fresh and plentiful. I'd give it 5 stars but the bread was a little too much like a store bought loaf to me, versus freshly made on location. 

Overall I enjoyed my meal and will stop by again next time I'm in the area to try some of their many more options from the menu, maybe from the hot sandwich side."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I crave Heidi's deli...This is the best bread I've ever tasted and the service is with a smile! My favorite samich is the cajun turkey with avocado. I have never been dissappointed with the quality of the food and service, and I am definitely a frequent flyer there."}
{"text":"Heidi's has great lunch specials! Good food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty decent sized piece of metal in my coleslaw that I bit into and I'm still giving this place 4 stars...

In their defense, they said they don't make their own coleslaw (which is probably why its not that good in the first place), so the metal shaving wasn't their fault necessarily...

Anyways, awesome sandwiches, cool guys that work there, and that $5 lunch special with the delicious home made chocolate chip cookie will keep me coming back for more. Just no more coleslaw..."}
{"text":"OK, so it's in a strip mall in Peoria and the dull decor isn't some throwback to New York. The bread, however, is full and flavorful, the sandwiches are HUGE with lots of meat (or egg in the case of the egg salad sandwich) and simple toppings, and the service is very good. A little pricey, but worth it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"So I've had Heidi's bookmarked for like 4958742987 years and I finally and went and man, I've just been going back ever since! 1st of all, I LOVE their lunch special. It's 1/2 a sandwich, a side, a pickle, a cookie and a drink all for $5. Dude, more often than not, I can't even finish all the food. And more importantly, their sandwiches are fantastic!! I usually get the meatball sandwich or the Hell's Kitchen, and man oh man, are they yummers. Their cookies and cannolis are pretty fantastic-O as well. They make their bread fresh every day and you can taste the difference. YOU NEED TO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a great NY or Jewish deli on the West side. ( or anywhere in Az) It is so hard to find any out here. Cassella's is the best deli in Az but it is so far away. I keep hoping I will find another good one that does not go out of business. I stopped here today to check this place out since I was doing business nearby. I chuckled to see they have bologna and liverwurst on the menu. Cool, looking good so far. No Knishes on the menu though ;(

I ordered the chicken salad since i am  a lover of chicken salad and it was their special of the day. Although I am not sure what the special was since the bill seemed high. I ordered it with their Marble Rye bread. 

The sandwich was well stacked and looked good. I took a few bites and said to myself, 
\"Wow, this is pretty good as far as Arizona chicken salads go.\" I did not get too far into my sandwich when i noticed the taste changed. It started tasting really bad to me. I had to stop eating it. Looking at the sandwich I noticed the second half of the sandwich had grey and black colored meat in it. This is when I realized they used dark meat.  Sorry, no, not for me. I asked the worker and he sad they used half and half half. Half white meat and half dark meat. i could not finish the sandwich and I had a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the day.  

The bread was okay. They make it homemade but nothing to die for. The servers were very, very nice nice. They do not make their salads homemade here. Although there was nothing wrong with the potato salad/cole slaw it was not NY great and I expected homemade at a place that advertises itself as a Brooklyn Deli. 

To be fair I might go again if I was in the neighborhood. I would try something different since the half/half was just a taste thing for me. ( i never heard of chicken salad with dark meat though) However, with that said, 9 dollars for a sandwich and fountain drink on special seems  really high for something that is not, \"blow me away delish.\" 

I will give it a three star review to be fair. The place was packed and some of the other items I saw looked good. Maybe a second trip to try some of the other homemade breads. The place did just not blow me away as anything great but not bad either."}
{"text":"I had eaten here once before and I guess the food was just OK because they are only a couple of miles from where I live and I had not gone back. Well I wanted a hot dog and I was in the area so decided to give a go. When I was at the counter I remembered my last visit. Food was good but there was way to much bread. They do have a great selection of bread. They slice it thicker than store bread. The sandwiched appeared to have a generous amount of \"Fixings\". If that is proper to say. But I did not have a sandwich. I had a hot dog. And a very good hot dog at that. Nice and plump. Then with all the great breads they have they put the hot dog in a plain old hot dog bum. It would of been a 4 with a better bun. Just a suggestion. 

Decoration? Hey it is a sandwich shop. Appropriate decor for a sandwich shop. Staff was friendly but may of been a little more helpful. Since it was not posted what came on the hot dog I asked. Response, \"anything you want\". No we don't have that. Kinda of a guessing game. The atmosphere was very noisy and it was not very busy at the time we visited. Lots of loud people. 

I will be back and try one of their sandwiches."}
