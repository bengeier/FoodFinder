{"text":"Cupcake Goodness is a new spot in Whitby and it's a must-visit for anyone with a sweet tooth like myself. I've tried 4-6 cupcakes here and each one is as enjoyable as the last. You'll find your standard flavours here if you're looking to satisfy a craving but what I enjoy most about visiting here is that there are always new flavours and types of goodies on rotation (this week when I visited there was a Birthday Cake flavour!) You'll find macarons here, gluten-free cupcakes and even lactose-free cupcakes too. Cupcakes are $3.50 each, or 6 for $19. If you're overwhelmed and not sure what to try first - Get yourself a Chocolate Salted Caramel Cupcake and a latte. After you have either one of these you'll be a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent cupcakes!  We had a 20th anniversary at work to celebrate - and these cupcakes were so decadent that they were a perfect choice for the event.  Ordered in advance and ready for pick-up on time.   We ordered 3 dozen across 8 different flavours.  The salted caramel were the first to be finished!  Extra special cupcake with a \"20\" was a nice touch too.  Already placed an order for a birthday next month.  Definitely will be back to try the other flavours and a Latte."}
{"text":"NOTHING BUT AMAZING!   Carla was quick and great with communication. She exceeded my expectations with my cake order. A lot of other cakes were charging an arm and a leg or saying it was too elaborate to do. But Carla did not disappoint!  Artwork was stunning and her cake was just as delicious. It absolutely a hit at my nephew's party; everyone wanted to know where I had gotten it done. I will most definitely come back for future events!"}
