{"text":"Juste un mot pour décrire ce restaurant: AMAZING!!!!!
La bouffe, le personnel, le décor, les prix, vraiment génial. Je le recommande fortement."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick coffee.  Didn't want any food, just a coffee.  Coffee was good.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in the middle of downtown. The decor is reasonably comfortable, if a little nondescript.

I found the menu rather confusing; it seemed a little disorganized and unfocused.

Tried the bacon hamburger upon the staff's recommendation, though in the menu it's not clearly marked; there are two hamburgers listed and you have to read the list of ingredients to figure out the difference. The food came very promptly.

The burger itself was okay; the patty was a touch overcooked. Condiments were alright, though the addition of bacon on top of some sort of unknown cheese (cheddar? Kraft singles?) made it pretty greasy.

I substituted the fries for salad, which again was ok but nondescript. Bell peppers were sliced without removing the seeds and pith first, so I had to do that myself; it was dressed with (again) a nondescript Italian dressing, out of a bottle. I would have preferred olive oil and lemon juice."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I love this place and visit it every time I get to Montreal. I've tried their lasagna and the cheeseburger and it makes the top 10 in terms of cheeseburgers of all time. The owners/staff are extremely friendly and the service they provide is wonderful. 5/5 and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best burger I had in Montreal! The food is very good value too, big portion for reasonable price."}
{"text":"When I first walked in for lunch I was nervous because no one else was in there. I quickly learned that there are five star food and five star service was both well deserved. My son and I are very picky eaters and they made a special salad just for us. Their prices are reasonable and their service is outstanding"}
{"text":"Cafe ma fee was an absolute delight that I opened a Yelp account just to write this review.
I went in today to try it out and they have a great menu with very reasonably priced foods- there is nothing over 10$. I had the bacon poutine, which is not their specialty, but nevertheless it was great. 
While waiting for the food, the owner brought out a blueberry muffin on the house with nutella drizzle, fresh blueberries and sunflower seeds - this was amazing as it is handmade fresh and the presentation was beautiful.

Outstanding, friendly customer service, great spot for quality, low priced good with cool decor!"}
{"text":"Delicious hamburgers and Tork Kebab sandvish. Portions are more than enough. The place is relaxing. The staff are very kind and generous. I always enjoy my time there."}
