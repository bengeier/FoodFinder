{"text":"Delicious meats, funny staff, decent prices. Come on a weeknight to avoid the legendary queues."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is just OK. Unique ambiance depends on if you like to share a table with strangers. I can't believe they had no horseradish for their sandwiches. Quality is what you would expect of a deli that was not in New York city."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Great smoked meat sandwiches and met some interesting people in the family style seating."}
{"text":"This is, and always will be, the icon of my childhood -- my favorite meal, my favorite outing.  Powerful memories.  That little bit of hot dog with the liver steak, the amazing fatty smoked meat, the perfect fries, the cherry drink, the incredible high value rib steaks.  But alas, our memories deceive us -- because they stay locked in one place, one context, even as we and those around us undergo change.

And so it is with Schwartz's.    The greatness era is over.   The restaurant is now a parody of its old self - inundated with tourists who know nothing of authentic smoked meat as it should be.   Shame, because this place is in a downward spiral and I hate thinking that.  I hate knowing that.  I want it to restore itself to its old form -- where the meat was invariably moist and the experience was nirvana-like perfection.

Now, it's hit or miss.   One day savory, juicy, good - the next dry, flaking, lousy.   I will no longer waste my time in those outrageous lines knowing that there is little certainty I'll be rewarded for my efforts.   I'd rather hit Snowdon Deli where I know I'm going to get a hell of a sandwich or platter, plus all the trimmings, reliably. 

Indeed, it is a sad, sad day."}
{"text":"This place is worth checking out just because the atmosphere, but other than that it was a bit of a letdown. We took the smoked meat sandwich with fries. It wasn't that pleasant that when I ask what is in the sandwich, the waiter told me that only meat. However, it does have mustard (the cheapest kind) in it, so beware if you hate mustard (like I do). The meat has a ton of fat in it and doesn't really taste much anything. We split fries with my friend and the total per person was around 12-13$ - not worth the service and food. 

The menu is pretty small and their signature dish wasn't really anything special, my recommendation would be to try something else than the smoked meat. 

Overall: atmosphere is awesome, it really feels like an old school diner. However, a bit overpriced and not that good food."}
{"text":"Overrated place. So many better sandwich stores in Montreal. Besides, their attitude seems horrible to me. 
Last time, I went with my girlfriend. There were two young guys were having their food beside us. The stuff there were keep telling them finish their food quickly because they were only ordered sandwich. I can't believe this really happened. I didn't say anything because that is not my business, but I will not go back anymore."}
{"text":"The Best since decades. A MUST on Boul. St-Laurent in Montréal.-"}
{"text":"Delicious food and extremely friendly service!  Warnings:  turkey is not smoked there and frankfurters come with bread, not  bun.  However the smoked meat is so good the child who ordered hot dog quickly converted and fell in love with it."}
{"text":"The line-up is worth the wait! Ignore your diet for today. Don't go for the lean cut, get the old fashion traditional Smoke meat on rye."}
{"text":"Tip : unless you have the time to wait, hit up the take out shop next door. There are a few stools in the back and you get the same great sandwich. The pickle was probably the best part to be honest but its a really really good pickle."}
{"text":"Service is TERRIBLE.  There's no organization w/ the crowds who come to stand in line (what line?!) thinking it's worth the wait.  Total chaos.

The dudes who work there are absolutely RUDE b/c they can be.  It's a huge tourist hot spot so no matter how rude they are, they know people will keep coming back.  There's no incentive to give decent service.  Their attitude: just order and get out.

The food is MEDIOCRE.  The bread was stale, the meat was dry.  I prayed that the 1.5 hour wait was worth it (my older sister refused to leave until she tried the food so I was stuck).

I have learned over the years that checking out very popular spots are more likely a very bad idea due to the lack of incentive for the places to offer competitive service and quality.  They really don't have to and Schwartz is a perfect example."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by some new friends as a Montréal institution... and seems to be. It was pretty crowded, so our family of 4 was seated and shared a table with another party. We got couple of smoked sandwiches, hotdogs that are split and grilled, then popped on white bread, fries are okay, the sandwich is a good, not to big nor too small and tasty. We  ordered medium,  which has some fat in the cut... more flavor. We got the gravy and cheese fries as well, well, why wouldn't you. For the nonlocal, the black cherry soda rocks and so does the Fanta... which is a vanilla grape or something... great tasting. No credit cards, but they take American dough too..."}
{"text":"Bof, pas top. J'ai vraiment connu mieux.attrape-touriste!!! Dégoûtée d'avoir fait 30minutes de queue pour ça!!!"}
{"text":"Super bon rapport qualité prix!!! Service littéralement hors pair! La nourriture un peu tiède par contre..."}
{"text":"Been putting off returning to Schwartz's over the years because it's so damn busy. Every time I'm in Montreal I try to satisfy my smoked meat cravings with the likes of Lester's, Rubens or Main because I didn't want to wait in line forever. But none of those really hit the spot. 

Then today I realized that they have the location next to the dine-in for take away. Great choice. Quick service - in and out.

Nothing really beats Schwartz's in terms of smoked meat. Nothing. It is a little bit of a cliche but there's a reason why people line up to eat at these guys."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be....

Had been a regular customer for over 20 years... but in the last few years we noticed it is not what it used to be... a decline in consistency little by little... along with an increase in price little by little...

The kicker was when my parents visited the last time.  My father had been hearing about Schwartz's literally for 20 years from my mother my siblings and myself.... and anyone he knew who had made the journey from out west to visit me.... it felt like I dragged half of western Canada to schwartz's over the years... We took my father there and saw it from his eyes... it is no longer the gem it used to be and we will miss it as it was when I first moved here....

We did not have to wait for a table - the only blessing ... we made sure we went early enough to be before the evening rush... so it was busy but not crowded and there was no line. It would have been dreadful to wait for that meal...


Our waiter was a liitle too chatty ... I prefer the old style where they were efficient and slightly rude... you got hot and good food... and we're left alone. he should have spent some time cleaning instead. Our table was sticky and we had to ask for it to be cleaned... we also noticed that the place in general could have been cleaner...and this coming from a man who had eaten in some of the dodgiest places in Asia. 

The meat in our sandwiches was dry and cold. We generally like medium... but not served cold... the fat was hard instead of buttery melt in your mouth gooey. The pickle was OK.  The fries were inedible. They had stopped being home cut for a while but they had always been hot at the very least... not so on this visit. 

We did not eat it... and tried to send it back. They did not offer to exchange it or correct it. We left with the cherry colas in our hands and a sinking feeling in our hearts.... and went to find somewhere else to eat.

Would give it .5 star if we could for the cherry cola and pickle.

Sad to say that we cannot ever recommend this once fabulous institution and will never step across its threshold again."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat sandwich and pickle! I preferred to deconstruct mine and eat it, however, because the meat to bread ratio wasn't right. There was a long wait at 1pm on a Monday. Go to ripples ice cream across the street after your sandwich."}
{"text":"We went for the smoked meat, their specialty. It comes on white bread with mustard, and a cherry coke is recommended to bring out the flavor. The wait was relatively quick; the staff is friendly; and the smoked meat is, well, smoked, if that's what you want."}
{"text":"I went there a couple of weeks ago. It's simple. If you like huge piles of tasty meat. Come here. If you don't. Stay away. I had there standard sandwich. It was good. Lots of meat. My gf is a vego. So she had a overpriced pickle and some soggy fries. I have heard some say its a smaller cheaper version of Katzs in NY....
If you like meat, come here."}
{"text":"There were so many people and the line was long so we decided to do take out. The food was good and very filling. The only downside is that it only accepts cash and if you don't have Canadian dollar and want to pay with US dollar, they do almost 1:1. The food was $28 Canadian dollar and the lady at the cashier asked me to pay $26 US dollar.(which is $32 Canadian dollar)"}
{"text":"Awesome food and super fast service. Girlfriend and I had the smoked meat sandwich, fries, peppers and coleslaw. Best $18 we've spent so far!"}
{"text":"freaking delicious. small hole in the wall,  we went on a Saturday lunchtime and didn't wait long at all in line. fast and delicious,  I had the lean which was a bit dry,  as expected,  but still amazing,  my husband had the medium, it was all great."}
{"text":"Small, dark and even narrow, this place doesn't attract the look but believe me, it's the temple of smoked meat in Canada.


 Since 1928, it serve the most delicious sandwiches I've ever ate. Secret recipe, but not-so-secret-ingredients : Meat! :)


 If you leave Montréal without eating at least once at Schwartz's then you missed something! :) I'm drooling just by writing those lines...."}
{"text":"Awesome meat, take the medium or lean type if u're on a diet!
If too crowdy take the left entrance for take-away much quicker!"}
{"text":"Our taxi driver from the airport said to come here (as did my travel book) and that 6 months from now we will be craving the smoked meat sandwiches. We stood in line for the restaurant for a while, but opted to go to the take-out store next door. We were very glad we did that....the line moved fairly quickly and we got seats at the back  of the store.

We had 2 smoked meat sandwiches, a pickle, and poutin. It seemed like the take out area was the only place to get poutin. We hadn't tried it on our trip yet, and I thought it was probably a good spot to have it for the first time. The sandwiches were the perfect size. We originally only ordered one, but one wouldn't be enough to split for lunch. It was a very good sandwich, but it was not any different than good deli's in NYC. The poutin on the other hand was heavenly. The gravy was rich and tasted of beef, and the curds and fries were very fresh. I will definitely go here again, but mainly for the poutin. If you don't get to NYC frequently, then I will say you will definitely love it for the sandwich. Like I say, since I can have Katz's or Sarge's in NYC any time, it didn't seem much different. Here's hoping that America adopts poutin!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time here.  I would say if you can, definitely sit at the counter.  The counter guy was great!  He was funny, nice, and entertaining.  When we first sat down we were trying to get our bearings and look at the menu.  The place was crazy busy and the staff were flying around the place.  We were looking up, and the counter guy good heartedly shouted at us, \"Sandwich, fries, and a pickle.  That's all you need.  2?\"  It was really great.  It also was all we needed.  It was absolutely delicious, and huge portions for the price.  It was a very social, casual and fun atmosphere.  We chatted quite a bit with the counter guy and a few other customers.  It was our first stop after arriving in Montreal, and it was an amazing welcome.  We will definitely be back here.  A few things to note:  They are cash only, and we apparently got really lucky getting in without much of a wait.  Every other time we walked past there was a huge line."}
{"text":"Nice place to go eating the famous smoked meat ! The meat tastes really good and that's what you want, right ?
However, I couldn't help but notice that place on the other side of the street, Main Deli. Well, in short, Schartz seems quite overrated after eating there too ;)."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time after learning it was one of Montreal's landmarks. We were very happy and surprised by the quality, quantity, and price of the tasty meats. The line up was non-existent, surprisingly, as we expected to wait a while from other reviews.

We had the turkey and the smoked meat. The turkey was good, but not the best that I have had. Luckily there was mustard on the table for added flavour. The portion size, however, was huge and awesome. Lots of fun to eat.

The smoked meat was amazingly seasoned and very tasty. Definitely recommend having that. We also had the coleslaw which was a little liquidy, but refreshing. The pickle was big and shareable. Always good with a nice deli sandwich. 

Kudos to the staff who were funny, welcoming, and entertaining. They also gave us a tip that Celine Dion (who actually is the owner of Schwarz's) was coming in to the restaurant and we actually got to meet her. Totally made the restaurant experience a million times better! They apparently get a lot of celebrities coming to eat there too. So you might get lucky!"}
{"text":"Best Smoke meat in the world Hands Down"}
{"text":"This place is a Montreal must. I've never actually eaten in the dining room, though. I've only gotten food to go and taken it to the nearby park or eaten it at the bar stools in the take-out section. Of course my favorite thing on the menu is the smoked meat sandwich. It comes with mustard on it and it's sandwiched between three slices of bread...that's how much meat they give you. That one sandwich is enough to completely fill a person up. Maybe that's why they sell the sandwich without any sides. I, however, always split a side of fries with my lunch mate. They're the perfect combination of crispy and soft, with just a little seasoning, but not too much. The employees in the take-out side move customers through the line quickly, too. Schwartz's is a fabulous option for a quick, easy, delicious lunch in the Plateau."}
{"text":"solid prices considering, def an mtl institute, good memories and attentive waiters, also delicious smoke meat which this city is known for, worth the visit, 5 for the memories"}
{"text":"This is review is from our visit to Montreal in August.

Like everyone, we had their smoked meat sandwich, but the fat version. I admonished my husband for ordering it but then I had a bite--it was tender and, admittedly, delicious.  (Fat is tasty!)   

We were lucky and didn't have to wait in line. Although the sandwich was satisfying, I don't know if it was \"wait in line for a hour\" good."}
{"text":"First of all, accept the fact that you're going to have to wait in line to get in.  It's also quite likely that said queue will stretch down the block.
Don't let this deter you.  The line moves quickly because it's not really a place where people can linger; there are only a dozen or so communal tables + a row of stools at the bar.  Also, the staff are pros at keeping track of who's next to be seated, and they turn the tables fairly quickly, too, without rushing patrons to go.
On that note: DON'T try to cut the line.  Unless you're a major celebrity or have known the owners since birth, you'll be unceremoniously bounced out the front door.  We watched at least 3 people try to sneak in during Saturday lunch, and the host/waitstaff weren't having it.  Fair warning.
Once you're ushered inside, you're directed to the nearest open seat and are pretty much immediately on-deck to have your order ready.  That said, the only thing you really need to decide is whether you want your meat served up lean, medium, or fatty (I went with \"lean,\" and I thought the texture and moisture were perfect), and if you want it served on seedless rye bread or au naturale, i.e. on a plate.  (Tip: skip the bread.)  
From there, your only dilemma is how many kosher dill pickles to order on the side.  (FYI, these are not your typical namby-pamby dill spears, folks.  These are whole, crisp cucumbers, brined and spiced to perfection.  You'll want two.  Trust me.)
The meat is unique (fork-tender, peppery with a hint of smoke, and perfect when slathered with the house mustard); the atmosphere is authentic (the spartan decor looks like it probably hasn't changed much since the 1940s or 50s--in a good way); and the service is fast and efficient.
It's a memorable meal that is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Schwartz's est une institution à Montréal. On a beau entendre que c'est surfait, que l'accueil est passable et qu'on se marche dessus pour avoir l'honneur de goûter ce qui passerait ailleurs pour un banal sandwich à la viande, rien n'y fait : on se laisse séduire par l'ambiance rustique et le goût de la viande fumée servie en abondance entre deux tranche de pain blanc. La gourmandise coupable y est pour beaucoup.


 En arrivant avant le coup de feu, je n'ai pas eu à faire l'expérience de la légendaire file d'attente qui piétine sur le trottoir, mais j'ai mesuré ma chance en ressortant peu après alors qu'une foule de candidats à la crise cardiaque s'amassait déjà en un serpent compact.


 Bon et pas cher, à faire une fois pour qui est de passage en ville."}
{"text":"I always thought smoked meat was a little overrated. I mean, it's layers of meat between two slices of bread. What's so great about that? Man, was I ever wrong. If smoked meat represented heaven, Schwartz's would be God. It is quite possibly the most delicious smoked meat I've ever had- so delicious, in fact, that I'm willing to wait an hour in the blistering cold just to get a sandwich, which is saying a lot considering I won't even wait an hour to see my favourite film in the theatre. Strangely enough, because of how small the place is, and the layout of the shop, Schwartz's is also a wonderful place to meet people- tourists and locals alike."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend as a \"must do in Montreal\". 

The scenery inside is not far off from what you would expect from a bus-depot cafeteria. 

The waiter could see we were a bit out of our element and recommended the smoked-meat sandwich. My boyfriend ordered 1 sandwich to share.  I've never came that close to striking someone in public. That smoked-meat sandwich was what dreams are made of. I'm salivating while writing this one month out. Selfishly we ordered another sandwich and my once full-length shirt began to show off my mid-drift in a rather unflattering manner. 

I regret nothing and highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who spends any amount of time in Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing smoked meat sandwiches and pickles, along with very friendly service for locals and tourists alike.  Well worth the potentially long lines and crowded, shared tables, especially if you love you some smoked meat."}
{"text":"Schwartz has some very good smoked meat, that has to be said. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it is definitely worth going. The fact that people wait in line for so long is a testament to its quality. 

On the other hand, the aforementioned waiting time is too long (it feels like trying to get into a packed club) and the service is terrible, which pretty much ruins it for me. They will pack you inside wherever they can, and nobody really pays any attention to you. I understand that they are always extremely busy, but I'd rather go to a different deli where i can actually eat comfortably..."}
{"text":"Iconic deli. It's a must visit if you're in Montreal. The sandwich itself was great...just meat and bread (nothing to get in the way of enjoying the smoked meat)."}
{"text":"So, I don't like meat. I'm more of a veggie and fruits person with the occasional tofu. But of course I had to try out Schwartz's since I live in Montreal. Man. It was really good. I don't know what it was about this humble sandwich, but it was so delicious, and I drool thinking about it. 

Go late at night (9pm or later), or just get the sandwich as a takeout and eat at some public space, like parc Jeanne-Mance or quartier des spectacles just in front of the place-des-arts métro, and you will save hours :)"}
{"text":"it is a bit overrated. Been here 3 times and never really like the heavy food. If you love meat, then come. But reminder:  it is just a lot of meat and just meat....It is a bit unified taste all through the meal..."}
{"text":"If you love smoked meat or even if you think you don't...go here! While in Montreal, my husband desperately wanted to eat at Schwartz's. My smoked meat experience has not been great but I agreed because I'm a wonderful wife :) I am now a Schwartz's convert. 

We waited in line for 2 minutes. We sat down in the packed deli and ordered 2 sandwiches medium, 2 drinks, 2 pickles (YUM!) and 1 order of fries. The food came quickly and it did not disappoint. The fries were hot and complimented the sandwiches. Our bill was a little over $25. We will definitely return on our next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"The smoked meat is great but everything else about this place needs an overhaul. Cash only. Huge line ups. Not the friendliest servers because they are popular. Seating is limited. But I am willing to overlook the downsides because of the great smoked meat!"}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try out Schwartz's after having already waited in a few outdoor lines over the past week -- sometimes in the snow -- but this wait was worth it. Our server was very friendly and I was inclined to order a chicken sandwich at first but he was kind enough to let me know that the chicken had been from two days ago and let me try a sample of the smoked meat. My friend and I each got a full sandwich for ourselves and split an order of French fries. So, so good. With just enough (homemade) mustard on two slices of white bread, this was just what I needed at the time. Our server bagged up our leftovers for us when we were ready to leave. This a cash only establishment. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This was okay, meat was fall apart tender but didn't have the kind of smokiness I was expecting. Not as insanely humongous as the sandwiches at Katz in NYC, so this is either a pro or con depending on how much you value large portions over food wastage. Ordered a coleslaw on the side and that was not the creamy type you get at KFC, was in a clear pickling liquid but hat was quite yummy to have with a meat heavy meal."}
{"text":"best smoked meat in Montreal and the world"}
{"text":"This place is super overrated. First of all a sandwich (just a sandwich!) is $9! The sandwich meat was dry and the bread was tiny. The fries were soggy and  not very good. The seating is horrible.. I know it's an old diner setting but it was squishy and uncomfortable. I would not recommend and it's definitely not worth lining up for."}
{"text":"The smoked meat is ok, but not as good as I thought."}
{"text":"Although you're probably going to have to wait a relativity long time, and you're probably going to have to share a table, it is worth it. 
The service was super fast, and being from NYC, prices were reasonable at around $8 a sandwich. You get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Great smoked meat sandwich! The restaurant is really small but they seat you and bring food really quickly. Wife and I were in and out in 30min and there wasn't a seat available!"}
{"text":"I have found a pastrami (smoked meat) sandwich that rivals Katz's Deli in NYC. Moist meat, freshly sliced, tasty!"}
{"text":"This world famous deli has been a staple in the 514 for a very long time, and is no question one of the great prides in the hearts of my beautiful Montreal-ites. Such accolades of course result in grossly long lines at all times of the day.  I just wish I had a better taste experience from my visit.

Of course, I went for the classic smoked meat sandwich with mustard on (i think) rye. It was good, but not outstanding. I actually found the meat to be a bit on the dry side. Maybe it was because of my pre-conceived notion that it'd be juicier, much like a pastrami sandwich. Not the case in my experience, but I'll be sure to give them another visit when its warm enough to stand in line for 30 minutes to an hour, which probably means mid July.

{"text":"Was at this place over the long Easter wknd 2014.  Place was already packed at 10am on a Sunday. Didn't get a chance to check in... and new back in TO and it will not allow me to.  Lol

Walked in and asked for a hot corn beef sandwich to go... it was ready in 2 minutes.   The sandwich was delicious.  But they not get a chance to sit in or order anything else.   No pickles or fries :(

Sandwich was a bit small but very good.   

Cost of sandwich was $8.90.  Well definitely order 2 next time... lol

After the sandwich, went next door to pick up 2 packs of meat to go.  Have not tried it yet... but don't think it will taste as good as eating there."}
{"text":"Montreal landmark and excellent smoked meat! It's simply great!
I've been to multiple events where they were catering and I find the concept of making fresh sandwiches on the spot is incredible!
I had a medium lean sandwich which was not too greasy and not to dry just perfect."}
{"text":"Got a sandwich and cherry pop to take out- meat was good, not extraordinary. Kat'z is just as good. I was told by the cashier that I better leave a tip...such a turn off. I left a tip anyways and I really shouldn't have."}
{"text":"Well, HELLO smoked meat sandwich! 

My friends and I went to this place at at 12am since that's when we arrived in Montreal. Yup, it was our first stop. The guys were adamant on this and from all the other ratings you can see why.

Got the smoked meat sandwich (medium because I can't give in to my inner fatty...at least not in front of my friends), fries and a cherry pop, which apparently is THE drink to have to wash it all down. 
Topped the sandwich with some mustard, inhaled it and washed it down with cherry pop. Delicious. Done."}
{"text":"Every time that I have been to Montreal in the last six years, I have gone to Schwartz's.  More because of my husband's affliction for it: If we're in the city, he needs to go and get his fix. After all this time, I don't blame him.

Everyone has their own way of ordering - and I don't judge (unless that way is 'lean'; that I don't understand.) You might want a cherry coke with your sandwich. You might eat your sandwich with a knife and a fork. And that's fine. (My order? A sandwich, fries to share, a pickle, cherry coke. The A1 steak sauce needs to be nearby, too.)

I don't know if I would call this place 'the best restaurant in Canada' or 'the Katz's of Montreal', but it is terribly good smoked meat, in a style very different from New York delis (bagels and smoked meat - it's what sets New Yorkers and Montrealers apart). It's mouthwateringly delicious, served in a setting that requires that you get close to your neighbour (and I've had some great conversations as a result).

The line appears daunting, but the guy manning the door knows what he's doing. Trust him. Trust the staff inside. Trust the smoker in the kitchen that has been churning out incredible sandwiches for the past 82 years.

I just hope that Celine Dion doesn't mess it up when the sale is finalized."}
{"text":"Good meat but it's small, I took my out of town Friends here they were not impressed with the size of a $10 sandwich. Could have added a pickle on the side? I don't know if I'll bring guests here again..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the smoked meat sandwich (take medium) and the fact I didn't have to wait in line. The place is a little tight but has a good vibe. It lost one star for the $2 pickle and the fries which were warm and not \"hot and fresh out of the fryer\"."}
{"text":"I'm usually nervous about tourist hotspots but this is worth it. Deli style, fuss free, their smokes meat sandwich (bread, mustard, and a ton of smoked meat) is delightful. There are long lines, so either take out or go at a later timing (which is what I did). The smoked meat was basically beef - tender, slightly salty, with just the right amount of fat, and very satisfying. 

Service was efficient and well organized. Wouldn't expect more for a no frills deli. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The brisket is usually (and if you're a purist always) highlighted by a squirt of straight up yellow mustard. The subdued sting and jowl seizing bite of mustard contrasts the saltiness of the meat. The juiciness of the beef is pretty much consistent throughout each piece, and this is due to the brining, then the steaming of the meat. Some may argue that the retention of moisture is the attributed to phosphates used in the brining, however, Schwartz's boasts an all natural-non-chemical brining process. To be honest, they could marinade in a stew made of old gym socks, and I'll probably still glob some mustard on it and slap it on rye.

It kind of goes without saying that Schwartz's roots run very deep in Montreal, being opened over 80 years, Schwartz's has had celebrities of all kinds pass through their doors as well as had a musical written about them. The old timers behind the counter are just that, \"old timers\", take-no-shit-you-better-know-what-you-want-to-eat-dont-ask-me-for-suggestions. Make sure you don't ask for mayo, rumour is that you'll be banned for two years and no smoked meat for you."}
{"text":"Decent tasting smoked meat sandwich. Seems kinda pricey. Definitely a tourist trap. Nothing special."}
{"text":"One of the guys in the group wanted to try this famous place.  A short line was waiting but we got a table pretty quickly.

I went with the kitchen sink combo.  The sausage was pretty tasty.  the corn beef was kind of bland.  The steak was thin and just about right for a medium.  There was a lot of food and I finished everything but probably only ate a few sticks of french fries.

The line got long as we came out."}
{"text":"Just not what it used to be.

I've been going to Schwartz's since I was a young child, and have watched the quality slip steadily over the last 5 years. It's been most notable since Celine Dion bought it. The brisket just doesn't have the same flavour it used to, and it's often dry and stringy. Still a solid sandwich, but certainly not worth the line-up when there is one."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal.  My cousin's friend recommended this place to him.  Being in Montreal is like being in a France.  Everything was French to us.

Being from NYC, we are familiar with Kosher food, esp smoked meat.  The menu was very limited.  The waiter basically said order the beef or chicken sandwich.  Lean, Medium or Fatty for the beef for about $10 C.  The sandwich was good, but the meat was small portioned.  Ben's in Queens gave 2-3 times much for about the same price.

The place only took cash and gave a 10% discount for US dollars when the rate was close to 20%.

It was an interesting experience, but would not go back again."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for 3 days and ended up here once each day.

The place - Awesome, old-school iconic \"place to go\" that lives up to the hype. There's always a bit of a line for the restaurant, but the service is quicker at their takeout place next door.

The food - really a meat lover's dream. Smoked meat sandwich (medium) is perfect.

The price - surprisingly reasonable: $6.40 for the sandwich."}
{"text":"The very best smoked meat and corned beef anywhere. Who needs NY, LA, Cleveland or Ann Arbor?!"}

{"text":"Its of course very good.  Its an institution. However. I do not think that it's good enough to wait so long and go through the rudeness of the staff."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for work and had to check this place out. Had the fatty sandwich with the recommended cherry drink.It did not disappoint and is easily the best sandwich I've had bar none. They only accept cash."}
{"text":"Amazing place! If you are in Montreal, you probably have heard of visiting this place already, so what are you waiting for? Come and enjoy the classic smoke meat of Shwartz!"}
{"text":"The best beef brisket sandwich of all time.  Of all time.  I will try to describe it: smoky yet juicy, peppery yet salty, spicy yet sweet.  I realize I have failed to describe it.  You should go buy some and put it in your mouth and you will understand.

It would really be unfair to compare Schwartz's with another one of my favorite Hebrew Delicatessen's: Katz's in New York's Lower East Side.  It is unfair, but I will do it anyway. 

At Katz's, their specialty is pastrami, which is sweeter and sliced thinner.  They also serve it on rye bread with mustard, and it's also delicious, but it's totally different here at Schwartz's.  Katz's is the undeniable champion of the pastrami and the salami, but this smoked meat thing in Montreal is really special.  It wasn't until I came here that I realized \"Montreal steak seasoning\" that I have in my kitchen probably originated here.

Here at Schwartz, the smoked meat is cut by hand into big chunks and slathered on the bread.  It's very juicy and fatty, and more smoky than sweet.  Their mustard and spices work as a perfect counterpoint to the flavors they have working in the meat.  They're subversive.  This sandwich may be perfect as it is.    

The staff is also really cool and recommended that we complete the pilgrimige with fries, a pickle and a black cherry soda.  Do that.  The fries are awesome."}
{"text":"Der Kellner war super freundlich. Essen sehr gut und schnell. Wir hatten das Smoked Sandwich mit Senf."}
{"text":"Delicious! Went there today, got in super quick, despite a fairly long line. Got our food super quick. Ordered the smoked meat sandwich, with fries. Loved it! We went to Katz's deli in NYC last year which was beyond shithouse and cost a fortune ($17 sandwich? Get outta here) so this was a delight! Delicious meat, fresh bread, simple as that. Success."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. This one is a bit overrated online. It does not taste bad yet still far from delicious. The price is considerably too high for a smoked meat sandwich."}
{"text":"Client depuis 1985, mais de moins en moins depuis les 10 dernières années... Qualité pas uniforme, la découpe est faite n'importe comment, service complètement froid et artificiel comme dans une chaîne de restauration rapide. Préfère maintenant son némésis rue Bernard Lester's. Ce n'est pas la même viande fumée (viande plus pâle, mais plus onctueuse) mais je la préfère maintenant à celle de Schwartz (viande plus rouge, plus riche en goût, mais sèche)."}
{"text":"It is a Montreal classic spot. A must on your bucket list. Great smoke meat platter."}
{"text":"mmmm.....My hubby and I went to montreal for our first anniversary and this place made our trip....haha....mmm smoked meat, it would be worth the trip again any day :-) fyi do not get the low-fat, full fat is where its at."}
{"text":"My dad , who used to live in Montreal told me to come here and eat.  He also said ditch your coworkers if they dont want to try.   Came here twice in one week.  The first time was in a pouring thunderstorm and there was a line outside waitinfg for a table.  

When we finally sat down we ordered the large plate of smoked meat for my coworker and I, 2 dill pickles and fries.  Missed the black cherry soda but got a coke instead.  

The smoked meat is kinda like corned beef and pastrami but only better.  Its tender, flavorful and unique.  We left quite satisfied.

The second time was right before our plane ride back home.  Three of us went there in the moring and again we all missed the black cherry soda thing.   We all ordered the small plate and ate it all within 3 minutes.  They told us we could take the sandwiches back to the US but I dont know if its true or not and we didn't.  

They don't deliver outside Canada so go to Montreal and try it."}
{"text":"Followed the reviews and recommendations so decided to come to Schwartz's for lunch. The place itself is neat and the service was amazing, but essentially the smoked meat sandwich you are waiting an hour in line for is a corned beef sandwich that really didn't do anything for us. At least across the street I could have also had a beer (and waited much less). We won't be back. There are much better meals to be had in the city."}
{"text":"I've been  really excited to check out Schwartz's since I planned a trip to Montreal. I had the famous smoked meat sandwich but admittedly, it left a lot to be desired. It didn't taste any different or better than any corned beef I've had, so although it was good, I don't really understand the hype."}
{"text":"The food worth the neverending line but its def overpriced for a smoke meat sandwich and I think they still charge for their pickles. Thats just plain cheap lol
I would send tourists their but I only go every few years when a visiting friend insists or when we walk in front and the epic line isnt that bad."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place. The smoked meat sandwich was tender, juicy, and was seasoned well. The bread was nothing to write home about. I should have gotten some mustard on the sandwich. I felt the service was not friendly. We were there at 10:30 in the morning and there were only 2 people ahead of me. I said good morning and got no response from both employees, but I guess you don't go there for the service. Over all, the sandwich was good but quite pricey for the size."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not excellent. 
Been to a similar place in NYC, better than this one.
Price was bit expensive for a sandwich, their service and decor.

If it's just a random restaurant, i will give a 4 star. 
But with all the hope I got from yelp, I have to give a 3"}
{"text":"hmm hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about this place. 

Pros:
Smoked meat is great, 
portion size will fill you up,
price is fair,
service is pretty good, 

Cons:
Really crowded all the time, you usually have to wait in line for a seat, could take a while.
Its not very comfortable even after u sit down, you're uncomfortably close to other customers you dont know sitting beside you at a long table and you feel squishes from all sides due to the small size of the deli.

But all in all, its well worth the experience, I highly recommend you go try them out!"}
{"text":"I come to Montreal as often as I can and try to make it to Schwartz almost every time.  Usually I get takeout but lately I have found that there is no line if I get there around 10am for sort of an early lunch.  You read the other reviews which give an excellent description of the featured product, the smoked meat sandwich. Aside from this wonderful slow cooked uniquely flavored beef brisket you have delicious coffee and fries.  Go early order the smoked meat sandwich with a pickle and a side of fries. An interesting thing I learned was that most of the staff is 1st or 2nd generation Portuguese transplant.  Those are the sort of things you can pick up on if you come early before the lines.  You can truly appreciate the place.  Perhaps those that think this place is overrated should come back earlier in the morning and give it another try."}
{"text":"probably the best smoke meat sandwich i've ever had.  wasn't dry, wasn't too big either, which is good, those places with stacks of meat higher than the size of your mouth is stupid.  the portion size was just enough.  one thing though, the lineups are long, and if i had to wait, i don't think i'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Long line-up, but well worth the wait!!! Best smoked meat sandwiches I have ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Would give Schwartz 10 stars if I could!! This is a must when you are in Montreal. For a NY'er's palate, smoked meat is equivalent to pastrami -- however, with one exception -- because Schwartz's smoked meat is orgasmic.

We arrived mid-day on a weekend and there was no wait! We ordered a couple of the smoked meat sandwiches with mustard, cherry coke, fries, and pickles to complete the whole package. Schwartz's smoked meat is tender, juicy, and flavorful -- in my opinion, best when it is hot and steaming! Next time I am back in town, guarantee I will be back for more of Schwartz's."}
{"text":"I used to live a block away, but I had to move for health reasons- These guys gave me gout. But I have no regrets. If someone recommends a Montreal smoked meat deli other than Schwartz's then you can assume they don't know what they are talking about. Medium fatty sandwich with fries to go for me please. Although  sometimes I love to eat in and listen to the characters serving the food- free entertainment to boot!"}
{"text":"The hot beef sandwich was pretty tasty.  It was simple with good perfect amount of seasoning on the sliced beef (which had good bits of fat that is awesome) and a little mustard.  I didn't taste the smokiness but the meat quality was superb.

This place reminds me of Katz Deli in NYC but without the American over-sizing of meat and more taste.  The sandwich is \"small\" for price and for most Americans but perfect for us as we were eating on a hot day as breakfast (we're in vaca!). The restaurant looked mad busy where the take-out next door (looks like a regular deli) was dead quiet and perfect for us."}
{"text":"Great service and the food came out fast. Ordered the Philly cheesesteak and didn't know Steakum was still being made."}
{"text":"When you travel, there are always places that everyone tells you to try which end up being overrated, tourist trap disappointments. Thankfully, Schwartz's is not one of those. Despite being on the list of almost any person I spoke to about Montreal, Schwartz's amazingly lived up to its hype because of its smoked meat sandwich. That sandwich would easily be able to throw down with Katz's pastrami in terms of pure, smokey, beefy goodness with a little mustard. As I found out on wikipedia, montreal smoked meat is basically brisket, but it's different from pastrami in that more peppercorns and a lot less sugar are used. 

The craziest thing about this sandwich is that despite the overflowing, thick cuts of meat piled on your sandwich, it costs $6. six dollars?! Last time i checked, katz's pastrami sandwich was somewhere around $15. Even on a wet, snowy, December night, there was a line of about 10 people standing outside for their smoked meat fix. Now I understand why. 

Along with hockey, poutine, and vancouver dimsum, Canada should be damn proud of its montreal-style smoked meat."}
{"text":"This is the bomb. After only getting smoked meat from here for years I finally decided to try another smoked meat deli. Definitely regretted that. Get the large plate to share and a black cherry each. That's what I've been doing for years. Although I'm an anglophone Torontonian living in the US. I don't know if that qualifies me to give anyone advice about Montréal."}
{"text":"Not just hype! The best smoked meat I've ever had. 

The restaurant is small and you're seated at long tables, shoulder to shoulder with other diners. Old school style diner where you actually get to socialize with other human beings rather than being immersed in your phone. 

On to the food. The smoked meat sandwiches are out of this world. They offer lean, medium, and fatty meat. I suggest the fatty: it is the most flavourful. Sandwiches are overflowing with meat to the point where you need a fork to finish everything. The only condiment is mustard, and that's all you need. Also comes with a pickle. 

Depending on when you go, be prepared to wait in line. But the line does tend to move quickly and it is DEFINITELY worth it. Try to miss the lunch rush. We went at lunch time and waited about 15 minutes. But when we left there was no line at all. 

This is a must eat in Montreal. We were only in Montreal for two days and we had ate here twice. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is good but overrated.  Their smoked meat doesn't differ that much from more traditional corned beef.  The pickles they offer aren't the kind I like but they do go well with the sandwiches.  The black cherry soda that everybody says is a must order is good but no different from any other brand of black cherry soda.

On the whole, this was an enjoyable dining experience but not worth the wait in line nor the trip from Ottawa."}
{"text":"I was on a day trip to Montreal, and searched Yelp for \"best smoked meat sandwich\". 
This place didn't disappoint. It was exactly what I expected, rye, meat and mustard, stacked thick, and dripping. I felt like I had stepped back in time, as I'm sure this place hasn't changed a bit in 50 years. Didn't have one, but saw some pickles that looked delicious... A must stop place when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Love the smoked meat, and I get the long lines for that.
Don't get $9.50 for a sandwich that comes with (tah-dah!) smoked meat and two slices of bread. 
Paid extra for Every. Single. Side. Even the pickle.
And this is at the take-out side, so I'm not paying table service or ambiance.
Fries were soggy and had no salt. (Guys, don't leave the fries sitting over the fryer!)
Carrot raisin salad was yucky.
More love, please!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Schwartz's deli because of its reputation as the best deli for smoked meat anywhere. Like most people who come to Schwartz's we waited in line outside for about 20 minutes, and fortunately it was a lovely day so the wait wasn't bad. Once inside we sat at the counter which we liked cause you can see the action of the food preparers. 

We ordered the smoked meat sandwich, French fries, and a pickle. 95% of everyone in the deli had the same order. The meat was tasty enough, but a bit too dry for me. Nothing here to rave about. The French fries were plentiful, but hey they were just fries how can anyone mess that up. The pickle, well it was just a deli pickle.  What I missed most was having a beer with my dry smoked meat sandwich. 

Would I come to Schwartz's again when I'm in Montreal - definitely not! Now I know what all the hype is about and I know that whatever reputation this place has must have been earned at an earlier time than recently.  There are much better places to have a smoked meat sandwich in Montreal."}
{"text":"An institution yes. Same as it was no. One of those examples of selling out to become more commercial. Posters everywhere advertising their swag.

Not the best smoked meat by a long shot. Dry and crumbly. Pickles were great. Poutine was average.

Been, done, won't go back."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait! Try to go early if you can because they get really busy! Smoked meat sandwich is amazing! So amazing that once you try it you'll never be the same...yes it's that great!"}
{"text":"Definitely lives up to the hype. There are 3 types of meat: lean, medium, and fatty. Definitely go for the fatty one! with a sour pickle. Meat was so juicy and delicious!

The place was a little cramped but definitely worth it!

CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Wow, this place totally lives us to its hype. The smoked meat sandwich, poutine and pickle were all fantastic! I would go back again if I had more time on this trip. This place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Montreal I always make it a point to get a smoke meat sandwich here.  Still under $10 gets you a good sandwich was a good amount of meat.  And you can ask them to cut the meat just the way you like."}
{"text":"Does this place really need an introduction?  I feel like the CREATED Montreal smoked meat.  Choose the extra fatty version, juicy slices of beef brisket served with nothing more than mustard on rye with a pickle on the side.

The pickle is packed with flavour, it's fat and fits snuggly in one hand as you're walking down the street at 2am with meat juices smeared over your grinning cheeks.  Hands down best smoked meat sandwich you'll buy in Canada.  I went to Burough Market in London and their smoked meat sandwich didn't even come close!

Sometimes the line up is just not worth sitting inside, so take it to go but don't skip this must-feast joint!"}
{"text":"(Visited May 2014) Saw this on TV (yeah that AB guy), and decided we had to try it while visiting Montreal. Came on a Friday, line was out the door, but wait wasn't long. Got seated at a table for four with another couple. Ordered two \"medium\" (medium fat level that is) smoked meat sandwiches and sides of cole slaw and pickles. Cheap prices. Orders arrived quickly. Meat was good - but not as smoky as I'd imagined. A bit disappointing. The meat was also fairly fatty for \"medium\". Overall it was good but didn't knock my socks off. Moist but not terribly flavorful. Perhaps unfairly (?), i'd been expecting a lot of flavor. The bread was pretty plain too. The sides (cole slaw, pickles) even more disappointing, bland and tasteless, although I realize this place is all about the smoked meat. I don't believe in comparing apples and oranges, but compared to say, 2nd Ave. Deli in NYC, it was a letdown. Guess I'm more of a pastrami and rye kind of guy... But I'd be willing to give smoked meat another try. I was really looking forward to it after that AB guy sang its praises. Hopefully my taste buds just had an off day..."}
{"text":"I had to try this and the smoked meat sandwiches were ok, I think they are an acquired taste. Too salty for my liking but I can understand how some would love this place."}
{"text":"Lots of hype and expectation but it lived up!
Great smoked meat and the meat seems to melt in your mouth.
We got a plate of the smoked meat which is served with just slices of bread, and then its a DIY sandwich with bread, meat, mustard.

Mmm... ive been going around the city but i wanna come back here one more time before i leave!"}
{"text":"A smoked meat sandwich (@ schrwartz of course!) is #2 on my list of things that I have to eat on any trip to montreal!  

Note: There is usually a decent sized line out the door.  Anticipate waiting at least 30 minutes for a seat.  Also, for a foreigner like me - it was a little intimidating knowing what to order.  Go with the smoked meat sandwich, pickle, & french fries (or combination of these).  

Decor:  Deli atmosphere through and through.  It's all about the food! 

Food: I am getting hungry just thinking about it.  Smoked meat sandwich is something special.  Need I say more? 

Future endeavor(s): Yes, is a must on any Montreal journey."}
{"text":"If you like smoke meat you would like this place very simple and straight forward ! The place been the same for the past 100 years and you share table with strangers .its a hit and run place"}
{"text":"Indiscutablement la meilleure smoked meat en ville. À un prix très abordable, vous pourrez dégustez votre viande en sandwich ou en assiette avec ou sans frites. En revanche, la patience sera le maître mot car il y a souvent une queue pas possible avant de pouvoir pénétrer dans l'antre."}
{"text":"11 am was the perfect time to grab a sandwich. The line built up quickly outside as I ate. The smoked meat used the right part of beef with both lean and fat texture (not fatty after being smoked), and it was cut evenly. The flavor, however, lacked a bit of flamboyance that outstanding smoked meat could have offered. There was not much complexity to the taste that was possible for such meat. The cherry soda helped--I do not like it when drinking alone, but it somehow magically tasted better with the smoked meat."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat. Service is quick, once you get in. But there is always a long wait, so make sure to set aside enough time"}
{"text":"Amazing smoked meat sandwich. Being a Texan, brisket is a God-given right and this interpretation of it is the only other way I'd eat it besides how they smoke it at Kreuz Market in Lockhart, TX (I like them better than Snow's).

The locals told me to grab a Black Cherry soda and I did. Simple. Fantastic. Nostalgic, even for a first time."}
{"text":"Welcome to Sixth great customer service! horrible.

My experience with Sixt started of with getting down to the dark garage and being handed over a set of keys to the car I was about to have for a few months. One would think that they go over the cars before handing them over to the next customer, this is not at all the case. 

The car I was handed had been damaged all around the car  and had a huge dent under the back door on the passenger side.  I said the car is damaged. they responded we know. two months later i get a letter saying that i got into an accident with the car . i did not damage or had an accident with the car. They made  me responsible. NEVER NEVER AGAIN WILL SIXTH GET MY BUSINESS."}
{"text":"We came last week. We ordered 4 smoked meat sandwiches, a pickle and 3 fries for 4 people. We had so much left over fries. However, the meat sandwiches were just enough for us. They're not as huge as the ones from Katz deli in NYC. Meat was definitely very tasty. We liked the black cherry drink."}
{"text":"I had my first smoked meat experience in Brampton, Ontario. My colleague at the time said it was the best smoked meat in Ontario. I had no expectation since the only other thing I had that remotely resembled it was Arby's. When I had it, the meat was dry like the desert, and the mustard was over powering the flavour of the meat. So when Banana Girl wanted to try it at Schwartz, I was a little hesitant.


As we were drenched in sweat while walking down the Saint Laurent Blvd during our holidays, we were looking left and right for this place. When we arrived, we immediately walked to a packed store filled with history. It looks like a very traditional meat shop. Employees were dressed in uniforms resembling the movie American Gangster. We sat down dumbfounded, and full of curiosity. We obviously knew we wanted smoked meat but didn't know if there was a selection. The nice waiter (who looked like he worked there for 40+ years) told us that the best was  1/2 and  1/2. (Lean and fat) When it came, it looked amazing.


We didn't even attempt to use our utensils. We grabbed the sandwich and we were going for it. Smoked meat in general has a very strong flavor. I have done some homework on the technique of smoking, and understand that dehydration is a part of the process. I can't really explain why juices were coming down my hand. The mustard was a nice compliment to the sandwich itself. I just want to say, I will never have a Montreal Smoked Meat ever again, UNLESS I have the opportunity to visit Schwartz. I've been to the alpha, the mecca of this unique dish. I can`t imagine anything better.

 

Since this is a very short interview, I might as well review the beverage we had. I had a coke to go with the sandwich, and as I opened the can and inserted a straw, I`ve noticed every other table ordered a cherry type of drink. I can`t leave without trying a can. Here we are kids, Cott Dark Cherry Soda. It taste like... Fruitips Black Currant candy. If you don`t know what that is, I can`t help you. The only place you can have this is at Schwartz and Montreal local grocery stores.

Well, I am so glad I had an opportunity to visit Schwartz. NOTHING can replicate this place. It`s been around since 1928. Heck, there is even a musical based on it. If you are in Montreal and have any free time, this is one place you cannot miss."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is legend: the premiere place for authentic, Montreal smoked meat (especially since the equally ancient Ben's packed it in a while back). And they pile it on. The ratio of meat to bread in a Schwartz's sandwich (there's nothing else in it) is about four to one. If you want to eat healthy, the pickle will have to do.

You should do the sit down thing here at least once, just for the experience, but it's chronically crowded. Better to get a sandwich to go, if you have somewhere to take it. Those grease-packets keep well for a trip on the train out of town, just to cite one option."}
{"text":"A famous Jewish restaurant in Montreal so make sure not to visit during peak hours otherwise you have to wait for long or squeeze within the table and chair because it is not a fancy restaurant. The space is very limited. But you can ask for takeout. The price is cheap for a smoked meat sandwich given that it is so popular."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is a must do while in Montreal. 
I don't know if its smoked meat or the atmosphere, but you shouldn't miss it.

Even though maybe because of my origins I don't see smoked meat in general, in a north american form as a big deal."}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah - it's a Montreal institution, it's been around for 80 years or what have you.  It was good, I guess, but like almost every place with a line up, I found myself a bit underwhelmed.  

Prices are good, you get a lot of meat for your money, but I guess I was expecting a bit more complex flavour. It might just be that I don't know anything about smoked meat.  Service was good and quick and the pepperoni sticks were good too. 

I think I'll have to try Reuben's before I can evaluate it fairly."}
{"text":"I have heard that Schwartz's Deli is the best when it comes to Montreal smoked meat, so naturally we had to check it out. 

We went at like 8:30pm and the lineup was out the door. Luckily we were seated within 10 minutes. The decor probably hasn't changed since it first opened and it was super packed with people and tables, get ready to be very close and friendly with your neighbours. 

There was no question as to what we would be ordering! After we placed out order, we were served our food very quickly. The smoked meat sandwich looked slightly daunting, overflowing with smoked meat out of the bread. But that first bite..... Yum!!! The smoked meat was delicious! It wasn't over salted, had just the right amount of lean and fatty combination and was likely smoked. The mustard just gives the sandwich the perfect amount of kick. 

Overall, you have to come here to have their smoked meat! There always seems to be a line up there but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant, une institution à Montréal. 

Il est resté figé dans le temps, avec ses article accroché au mur, sa salle de restaurant à l'ancienne et ses serveurs (lol).

Le meilleur sandwich à la viande fumée de Montréal. Viande fumée de différentes façons, avec gros cornichons, frites ou Poutines... 

Accueil au top et fort sympathique.

Bémol: 
File d'attente, salle toujours pleine et assez petite et ils ne prennent pas la carte de crédit."}
{"text":"Definitely an icon establishment in Montreal. I absolutely loved it! The flavour of the smoked meat is like no other... I've never had any other smoked meat that comes close. The smoked meat with the black cherry cola was the perfect pairing!  Couldn't have asked for better. Well worth the wait in line.

I liked it so much that I bought a whole brisket and took it home with me on the plane. The spices they sell are great on meat for bbq'ing as well."}
{"text":"Schwartz' is not a very big place so seating is very limited. Be aware that if your group is small, you will probably share a table with other customers. Most tables seats six. There were two of us. We were seated in the middle. To the right of us was a local couple that had never been to Schwartz' before To the left of us were some nice folks from Wisconsin. Basically, we were sitting shoulder to shoulder having lunch with total strangers, which was fine with us. However, some people may be uncomfortable with the seating arrangements. 

The food? It was good, but I've been to better Jewish delis. 

The service? Fast, frenzied but friendly. The attitude seemed to be: Eat it and beat it. This can be either good or bad depending on your mood or occasion. 

Overall? Schwartz'  Deli  is a unique experience. Its a bit hyped but you should go at least once."}
{"text":"Shared tables, smoked meat, mustard and cash only. As good as they say it is."}
{"text":"Holy cow was I full after I left there.  Service was fast, prices were good and the sandwich was HUGE. hehe."}
{"text":"First time having Montreal smoked meat ! Super delicious. Had take out and are it in a park nearby. The poutine was mediocre. Cheese wasn't melted enough. Don't get the meat on the poutine, it tastes too meaty lol"}
{"text":"Boss:  \"You want to go to a conference in Montreal?\"

Me:  \"Umm, hell yea, I heard there is good food up there!\"

This place had a line when I got there for lunch on a weekday.  The wait was not that bad, but man it was worth it.  I ordered the smoked meat with...LOTS OF FAT!  Of course, fat = flavor...right?  Well, it was pretty damn good.  I mean, it didn't change my life or anything, but if I lived here, I would probably hit this place up at least once a month.  Cheap, delicious smoked meats.  Sit down, order and make yourself a sandwich."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, line is way too long always. Which I'll never understand. Pro tip: order take out instead and eat in a park."}
{"text":"This place speaks for itself.  If you havent heard of this place, where have you been.  I tried the hot peppers this time and they were amazing."}
{"text":"Went here the morning after a long night of drinking and boy did it hit the spot.  Got there around lunch time and the line for the restaurant section was out the door and down the block.  Me and my guys opted for the to-go side and even there we had quite a bit of a wait.  After ordering an enormous amount of pastrami and some sides we got lucky and found an area to eat in the back.  Let me say that it was the best pastrami sandwich I had every had.  This coming from a New Yorker who enjoys Katz.  I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of that sandwich and the only bad thing is that I can't have this unless I am up in the great white north."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat I've ever had. Every time I visit montreal, this is a MUST have!
Ill travel the 6+ hours from Toronto to Montreal for this!
Craving the smoked meat now :("}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch with my daughter and was not surprised to see the lineup to the corner.  There is a reason!  This is THE hot spot in Montreal for a reason.  That was the best smoked meat sandwich I have ever had."}
{"text":"It looks vintage and authentic but the food is bad for your health, sugary drinks, hyper salted processed meat, white bread. There is a little bit of vegetables but it's pickled so not sure about health impact.

At the end of the day, all you're left with is a salted and processed taste in your mouth.

Even if I was paid to eat this, I wouldn't."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were great!!!! We've decided to buy more before going back to Torotno! However, soft drinks are 1/4 of the price of sandwiches, not worth it. Long line up uhhhh we waited 20 mins at almost 10pm"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of St. Laurent Blvd, Schwartz's is a staple of the Montreal experience. The only thing you should ever order is a smoked meat sandwich medium with mustard, french fries, and a dill pickle. 

They overload your sandwich with such succulent smoked meat that literally melts in your mouth. The staff was super friendly, and were very attentive even though the place was incredibly busy. 

If you're visiting Montreal YOU HAVE TO COME HERE. I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Schwartz has the best smoked meat I've ever had. There's always a lineup. The inside of the restaurant is nothing special so I would recommend getting a take-out instead. It saves time and you get the same quality meal. Order their fattest meat with a pickle. That's all you need."}
{"text":"Great meal, lots of flavour in the meat, nice and juicy.  No frills set up - family style seating, but fast courteous service.  Definitely recommend to anyone visiting he city as we were."}
{"text":"Crowed, pricey, loud....good corned beef. 
You'll have to elbow your way in and scrunch up small in your seat, if you want to get in anytime around lunch. 
I had the corned beef on rye, which was warm, delicious, and OK sized portion (hardly what I would call \"ample\"). 
The service is abrupt and almost military. Don't expect a smile or small talk with your server. 
It is loud, and a little dingy looking.....and VERY crowded.
I am not snobbish. I know that it's a deli, not a fine dining establishment, but I've eaten at the Carnegie Deli, and Lindy's in New York several times. also good deli fare, and bustling crowds, however they seem a little cleaner, and although you still have to share tables with other dinners, they do not seem to cram them in so tightly.
I would still say that it is good deli food, for not unreasonable prices, but don't expect much more than that."}
{"text":"I first went to Schwartz's in August 2001. Walked right in a little after 1:00 pm on a weekday, sat down with no wait, order was in promptly, food came soon afterward, and had an amazing smoked meat sandwich with a black cherry soda and fries.  Pure heaven.

I returned in June 2012. Walked right in at a quarter to noon on a weekday, sat down with no wait, gave my order, food came soon afterwards: smoked meat sandwich with a black cheery soda and fries. Phenomenal.  

I heard Celine Dion bought the place from the original owners.  She better not mess up a good thing or so help me I will go Liam Neeson in \"Taken\" on her!  Except without the Krav Maga, because I'm never gonna learn that..."}
{"text":"Suite à une émission diffusé sur France 5 peu de temps avant
ma visite j'ai découvert Schwartz's et rien que les images m'ont données faim.
Shawartz c'est un restaurant hébraïque qui est pris d'assaut le midi. Pour les
pressé je vous conseil de passer votre chemin sauf si vous êtes seul car dans
se cas il est plus facile de trouver une place. A l'extérieur la queue peu atteindre 50m facilement de ce que
j'ai vu mais lorsque je suis venu (un peu en avance) il n'y avait que 10
personnes dehors. Une personne se charge a l'entrée de demander combien vous
êtes afin d'organiser au mieux ce qui permet des fois de se trouver a coté de
personnes que l'on ne connait pas du tout. 
En étant tout seul je me suis retrouvé au comptoir avec un Canadien et
sa colocataire française qui venait d'arriver en PVT. Cela a été très utile
puisqu'au final je me suis laissé guider par le canadien quand au choix :
un sandwich, frite, une boisson et le fameux gros cornichon. Pour ce qui est du
sandwich il n'y a pas non plus un choix énorme puisque la boutique est
spécialisée dans la viande fumé qui est préparé le matin et qui marine pendant
8h ! Ceci dit la viande est vraiment délicieuse : elle fond dans la
bouche et elle a un gout vraiment fin. Je tiens à saluer la dextérité du
cuistot car il coupe ce jambon à une vitesse incroyable et sans y laisser un
bout de doigt ! L'ambiance dans le restaurant est un peu bruyante mais tout
va très vite et tout le monde parle avec tout le monde. J'ai bien discuté avec
mes voisin pendant se rapide repas et j'ai appris pleins de choses sur Montréal
et les endroits à faire. Si j'ai l'occasion de retourner à Montréal je referai
ce restaurant même si ce n'est pas donné puisque j'ai payé 14 Dollars pour ce
repas."}
{"text":"I liked it fine, though I wouldn't go so far out of the way to get here next time. There's smoked meat plenty of places in Montreal in a better environment with a better menu selection as well."}
{"text":"I just just love the place a real classic a great place, ambiance, fantastic service . Great smoke meat sandwich on rye bread with a cheery coke all yummy.
Going back next week. A true Montreal classic."}
{"text":"Delicious. Be sure to get the fries and a Black Cherry (Cotts) soft drink.
If you want to seem like a regular, just say what kind of cut you'd like: \"lean, medium, old fashioned\" and nix the word \"sandwich\"!"}
{"text":"Below average.. Too much fat in the meat, not enough bread to hold the meat making it difficult to actually eat the sandwich. Visited Montreal and thought this was a special place to check out, but now I simply can't recommend it."}
{"text":"The hype is real and food was ill - fuck with it heavy"}
{"text":"This famous restaurant is good, but there is better smoked meat around. Their smoked meat is the fattiest around (which may be why some people love it so much). If you order their \"lean\" smoked meat, it is really dry. You'd be better off going to another smoked meat place where the smoked meat is medium-fatty (not too much or too little) and delicious"}
{"text":"Long lines but tasty traditional smoked meat sandwiches. Take out or sitting in the restaurant might take a while but well worth it for your first time to the city."}
{"text":"I'd probably give it 3.5 if I could. I went in for the experience. Fantastic sandwich. Meat was cooked very well or smoked I supposed would be better to say. Very tasty and savoury. The establishment itself was great to be in. Very cool decor. Cash only is important to know. The price was a bit high for only getting just the sandwich so that kind of brought it down for me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place for smoked-meat.  I go there a couple of times during summer (I am lucky and can always avoid the long waiting line)..."}
{"text":"This is a review for the takeout section.

I recently visited Schwatz's for the first time in over 8 years and opted to skip the line by visiting their takeout operation connected to the main deli. The takeout place has bar-style seating at the back, so in theory this is a decent option if you don't need a table or service.

The takeout prices seem to be the same, and I won't complain about them because they're fairly reasonable (though the cherry soda seems a bit expensive).

I ordered a fatty sandwich, fries, and a black-cherry soda. The fries aren't bad, and seem to be fairly typical Montreal fries: dark, fairly crispy, and quite short with lots of fragmentary bits.

The real letdown was the sandwich. The flavour was there, but it was deeply compromised nevertheless. Unlike previous times I've been to the sit-down portion, the smoked meat wasn't actually sliced: instead, it was chopped up and combined in order to get the desired fat profile. Although I couldn't see the grill, there were obviously pieces/slices of meat laying on the grill, and when a customer ordered you could hear the cook chopping the meat together in order to get the right mix. This meant that some of the meat had been laying there for a while, and some of the individual pieces/fragments (which were pea-sized) were dry and almost seared. Fresh cut slices of smoked meat this was not. Disappointing.

In contrast, if your order meat by the pound at the takeout counter you will get fresh-cut slices."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat in the world, guaranteed
Service is soso depends who is waiter, but service is fast 
Best hang out food
World reknown Schwartz for a reason"}
{"text":"The best smoked meat sandwich. If the line is too long, check out the takeout place next door for seating."}
{"text":"Place is cash only - opens at 10:30 (not at 8:00 as posted on yelp site).  Had to wait an hour but well worth it.  Smoked meat was the best- very tender and moist.  Best sandwich ever ! Absolutely have to try if in Montreal."}
{"text":"Well you won't be disappointed everything everyone says is true. Get ready for some meat in your sandwich, only criticism would be the coleslaw more pickled than I would have liked"}
{"text":"World famous smoke meat! What more can i say. The best smoke meat in the world. Nuff said. Amazing quality, original and authentic. Highly recommended when in Montréal"}
{"text":"Loved the old school deli charm, fast service and delicious smoked meat sandwich. Sandwich was huuuuuuge. Tables are packed in so not a place to linger but service is fast so there is no reason to. Highly recommend to visitors in the area. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to its reputation! TIPS: For a party of 2 or more, rather than ordering individual sandwiches, we noticed that locals actually order a plate of meat which comes with lots of bread on the side. Ever since, we also do the same. You get more for what you pay for, and you can also decide how much meat you want in each half, open-faced sandwiches you make. It is also more fun to share the meat plate together anyway!"}
{"text":"A staple that I go to each time when I'm in Montreal. The smoked meat is definitely good, but I think it's become more of a novelty. There are definitely other good smoked meat joints in Montreal -- one that I recall being pretty good was at Reubens Deli.

There's usually a line up for the dining room at Schwartz. I don't know if it's worth the wait, but for me, it probably brings back good memories so I do it.  I would highly suggest buying \"take-out\" as they have some chairs in the back for you to indulge.

I would also highly recommend the black cherry pop."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Montreal and heard that we had to have a smoked meat sandwich. Selected the popular Schwartz's and my hubby loved it!! Have to get the Cott black cherry soda and a pickle to complete the meal. Delicious!! 

There is the restaurant (usually the long line) and the take out right next door. Even though it was a cold rainy day in mid-October there was a line for the restaurant. We hopped next door to the carry out section, got our food quickly and sat at the counter in the back. Highly suggest that when you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"As an out-of-towner visiting from the States, I had no expectations.  Just needed a place for lunch.  WOW.  I'm a new fan.  The sandwich didn't look very large, but this lunch ended up filling me up well into dinner.  The smoked meat was tender, juicy and tasty.  I haven't been to other places, but this place was fantastic.  At 1:30 pm on a snowy Wednesday, there was no line."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place so when my family and I stopped by Montreal we had to give this place a try! We got there pretty late (around 8:30pm) and there still was a line leading to the front door! It was sort of confusing because there were two lines, I guess one was for eating in and the other was for take out.

Inside is quite small and isn't the cleanest (but who cares because you're here for the smoked meat), service was very attentive and quick, and the sandwiches were very decently priced! My leftovers were a nice little snack the next day.

Overall a decent place to grab a bite =)"}
{"text":"Really good sandwich,  with French fries and pickles!
The staff are very nice.
Be patient to wait at the line."}
{"text":"I ate here with my friend and his friends.  It was a Monday, and we were lucky.  Normally, I heard this place gets packed and you have to wait forever.  We passed by on Saturday, and the line was huge.  Today, though, the wait lasted only 10 minutes or so.  The food is awesome.  My friend and I split a small plate, and it had lots of food.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  Huge amounts really, so make sure to come in with an appetite."}
{"text":"Yes, it's that good. The Holy Grail of smoked meat sandwiches on the Island awaits inside Schwartz's doors. You may have to wait a bit to get in, and it may be a bit cramped, but it is completely worth it."}
{"text":"Perfection! The smoked meat is like none other. A must for those visiting Montreal to taste the authentic kosher sandwiches."}
{"text":"Nothing bad you can really say about Schwartz's. It's the classic Montréal smoked meat place from a Jewish deli. Always consistently good, nothing bad to say. A note, ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS get your smoked meat sandwich medium, not lean, has way more flavour. Add a side of fries and a pickle and you're all set."}
{"text":"Schwartz's take out is right next door to the sit down deli. Awesome hot beef brisket. You can ask for leaner cuts although they'll  try to convince you that the fattier cuts are better. It's actually true.. the fattier cuts do taste better. A little salty for people with low salt tolerance but there're ways to fix that.  Nice people. Visited on Nov 12 2013."}
{"text":"Food wasn't the best but the ambiance was cool. The city has a good vibe and this place goes along with it.  Its kind of a must stop if you are a deli person but don't expect to be blown away.  Cash only, decent smoke meat sandwich , and delicious pickles!!! Service at the counter was good."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet my only advice would be don't judge the place by it's looks, it's awsome! The line was total worth it! The smoked meet plate and dill pickle side are a great lunch option, I'm happy I follwed the advice of the montrealers I've met"}
{"text":"Got the large plate. Wasnt that tastey. Poutine was ok too. Not sure why this place is so famous"}
{"text":"If you've never had smoked meat from Montreal, this is as good as it gets! A Montreal institution, it is worth the lineup. On a Saturday, you may stand in line with people in evening wear as well as jeans - come one, come all! Have the special - Sandwich, pickle, coleslaw...they have take out as well. A note to those from far away - they have the smoke meat vacuum packed and ready to go!"}
{"text":"Does not disappoint. Sit at the bar for faster and more intimate service. Don't be a wimp: order your smoked meat fatty and enjoy the extra flavour. Get a dill pickle and fries, and a cherry soda. Done. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Smoked meat is an interesting thing. It's corned beef that is smoked with a montreal steak rub. The food is good if you just want a meat sandwich with not a lot of fan-fair. They're known for making this smoked meat, and while it is good, it isn't something truly unforgettable. They give you a choice of lean, medium, and fatty brisket; which I like. I usually get the fatty brisket because I'm thin and in relatively good health. Once you've tried this place, you can branch out and try some of the adaptations to the recipe (smoked meat on mushroom toast, smoked meat on poutin, etc.). Much better than Katz deli in NY. But, then again: what isn't?"}
{"text":"I have sudden cravings for this time to time. I love spending a typical montreal time there with the smoked meat sandwich, cherry coke, dill pickles, and fries. Definitely recommendable to those visiting montreal."}
{"text":"So, I had such mixed feelings about my experience at Schwart's.  It was one of those things that was so hyped up to me that I expected it to be the most delicious sandwich ever.  However, that wasn't my favorite part by far, and I feel like it probably is what most people go for.  

The staff are super friendly and, of course, happily spoke English.  They even went out of their way to strike up conversation with me while I was having my supper.  I went at a sort of off time and didn't have to wait for a seat or food.  I chose the bar since I was flying solo, and the food came out almost as quickly as I could order it.  It was perfectly fresh and tasty though, and certainly not a situation of having been pre-made.  

The sandwich was certainly not the highlight of the meal for me, but it was good and the combination of it and the black cherry soda were fantastic.  The smoked meat on its own was top notch, but the bread just kind of got in the way for me.  I definitely had to add tons more mustard, but better too little than too much, I say. For me it was the fresh kosher pickle that really sealed the deal for me at this place.  It was perfectly crispy and sour and delicious.  If I hadn't been backpacking, there's no doubt that I would have purchase a jar for home."}
{"text":"\"It's the stuff that dreams are maaaaaade of.\"

While there is another female singer associated with Schwartz's (more on that later) it was Carly Simon who set the theme for my Schwartz's experience. 

We showed up on a Friday afternoon and were greeted with a short line outside. However, we only waited about 3 minutes because two seats opened up at the counter. I'm telling you, traveling in a duo is the way to go when it comes to popular eateries. This encounter was a three-way of simplicity: smoked meat sandwich, fries, and a black cherry soda. With a little extra sumpin' sumpin' in the form of a dill pickle that was large enough for two people to share. 

Oh holy hell. One the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. I intended to save half, but once I dove in there was no way I was stopping. Somehow, in an alchemy of food magic, three simple ingredients - meat, rye bread, mustard - combined to achieve sandwich nirvana. The fries were crispy and delicious, with the perfect amount of salt. 

Then, there was the black cherry soda (Cott's Black Cherry Soda, to be precise), which put this meal over the top. It was unlike any carbonated beverage I've ever tasted. I couldn't find it in the grocery store near where we were staying, but managed to snag a few cans at the Montreal airport. Had I known that the customs process was over and liquids were OK, I would have bought out their entire supply. I still have a can in my fridge that I cannot bring myself to drink. If anyone from Montreal is reading this, be my Cott's supplier and we will be BFFs for Lyfe. Other black cherry flavored sodas just don't compare. And it's not even like I have a particular interest in black cherries, this stuff is just AMAZING. 

Back to Schwartz's. The counter staff was very friendly and efficient. It was an overall great experience. I probably would have gone back, but there's just so much good food to try in Montreal. The very next day I saw on the news that Celine Dion had been at Schwartz's just a little after our visit. So even if you don't believe me, TRUST CELINE. 

(Black Cherry Soda. Remember that.)"}
{"text":"Had the smoked meet sandwich. It was good, but nothing amazing.

I would normally give this place 4 stars, but wow, the people that work here are jerks. Extremely rude and obnoxious. I would never go back."}
{"text":"Without any doubt, Schwartz's is an institution that has the best smoked meat in town. There is a huge line up and the wait is usually 30-45 minutes. This diner has a long history, and their smoked meat sandwich is out of this world! Do not underestimate this deceptively simple sandwich, their secret blend of spices and herbs were tweaked over the year to perfect this crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"After years of eyeing this place, I finally tried it out. Since everyone else has already written ad nauseum about how great the smoked meat/bread/pickles/etc. are (delicious, btw!) my contribution is to simply tell you when you go in order to beat the lineup. 

Plan your visit around the following three variables, and you may just get a counter seat with no wait:

- Worst weather possible (middle of rainstorm, windstorm, hailstorm or snowstorm)
- Later in the evening (after dark)
- On a lame weeknight (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday)

(I.e. I went on a Monday, in the middle of a rainstorm, at 8pm, and I was at the counter in 30 seconds flat and sinking my teeth into smoked meat goodness in under five minutes.)"}
{"text":"Practically everytime my native Montrealer husband and I visit La Belle Province, we end up at Schwartz's. Since 1928, serving the best smoked meat. 
We usually get take-out because the damn place is always packed! But if you do end up in Montreal, definitely worth a wait in line. Get the Medium Smoked Meat sandwhich, just the right proportion of marble and meat. Lean is too dry in my opionion. Must haves: Side of fries and sour pickle."}
{"text":"A classic in Montreal, smoke meat sandwich ok.  However, there is always a waiting line in front of the restaurant because of the restaurant small area."}
{"text":"This is best (and cheapest) meal I had while in Montreal! I could have gone here every day. I had the smoked meat (medium) sandwich with a pickle. I didn't get the peppers but they looked awesome! The servers were good and the sandwich came out fast. If you like your personal space, you should probably get a sandwich to go. You sit in cramped tables with random people, but I think the sandwich makes up for that. Everyone has to try Schwartz's during their visit."}
{"text":"Highly recommended!

Definitely a must-have when in Montreal. 

Delicious smoked meat sandwich."}
{"text":"It's small, noisy, the waiters are a little curt, but the food is excellent so I can't complain. We got the smoked meat, of course. It was everything I'd heard. The pickle was so-so and way too sour, but the meat was excellent.

There's really not that much to say about a great smoked meat sandwich :)"}
{"text":"If you are ever in Montreal, Schwartz is where you should be. There was a long line up but honestly, it's worth every minute of the wait. 

I have been to Schwartz countless times and it has never disappointed. 

A staple of Montreal foods, this Montreal smoked meat sandwich is like no other. It's flavorful and truly a delight!! The meat melts in your mouth and the mustard gives you that extra kick. Simply delicious!!"}
{"text":"Quality. However, a bit upsetting that they have swayed from their roots in recent times."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's a classic, most people love it, some people don't... Remember to specify how you like the meat, lean, medium or fatty.

I used to think, bah, whatever, but a few months ago, I started craving smoked meat, went to Schwartz at 11pm to get my fix, sandwich, medium, pickle, cherry soda, bam! That hit the spot.

Came back this past week with some friends from out of town, they loved it. We went next door to the takeout place, less wait, less crowded. Sure enough they liked it so much we stopped over on the way home so my friend could order some takeout for the road.

They have the mustard on the table, which is good because I felt like adding more. The medium is not too fatty, but it feels more juicy. And once in a while you get hit bit a bit of fat and it's like butter, yum. A bite of pickle, sip of the cherry cola, rinse and repeat.

Sandwich, medium, pickle, cherry coke, 'nough said."}
{"text":"I was all worked up for this so called fantastic smoked meat sandwich and my son and I went and tried it we were deeply disappointed. We ordered the smoked meat sandwich and cherry cola and I asked does a pickle come with it and he said oh yes of course. The sandwich was terrible and I have had better at dunns or your neighborhood restaurant and then I got the bill for this disapointment and it was a whopping 22.00 dollars never again will I go there waste of money and time."}
{"text":"We made a point to eat here, to enjoy the smoked meat sandwich, the ambience, and, truth be told, to compare to Katz's deli on NYC's Lower East side.  

First thing first - the staff is super friendly! And I don't think it was because we came in after 8 pm. No matter the server's age, young or older, each and every one of them was very nice, chatty and welcoming. Everyone is bi-lingual, and doesn't make you feel inferior if you \"ne parles pas Francais\". 

I sacrificed my vegetarian preferences, and ordered the famous smoked meat, along with half and sour pickles, and a side order of French fries, to share. All came very quickly, and I promptly bit into the sizable half of the smoked meat sandwich (aka pastrami), which was served on the freshest rye bread with a droop of mustard. The bread made a better impression on me than the meat: the latter was quite bland, though soft and well cooked. I added more mustard - nope, still not there. I toped it with the English brown sauce - nope, there's just something missing: flavor, spices!  I politely finished my half, pressing harder on the half sour pickles and fries. 

When our very friendly server asked how we enjoyed the meal, my husband honestly told him that it was not as good as the last time he ate there, about two weeks prior.  Well, not two minutes went by when a plate of freshly cut pastrami appeared in front of us, with the server saying THIS was the cut we should have had. Of course we had to partake, and, boy oh boy oh boy, THAT was phenomenal!  Juicy, flavorful, tasty, melt-in-your-mouth delicious! We polished that off so quickly, he brought more - all at no extra charge, simply to ensure the customers were satisfied with the meal, the service and the experience. The total bill was very reasonable, and,of course, we left a generous tip for the excellent service. 

So, from the horse's (server's) mouth: if you are not happy with the sandwich you received, speak up and they will replace it, no questions asked. Just do so before you finish the meal, as not every server may be as generous as ours was."}
{"text":"you do feel like cattle, but it's worth it. Note: I only go when I've got a tourist to entertain.

Great sandwhich!"}
{"text":"I've been to Montreal twice.  I've eaten here four times.  I proudly rock one of their t-shirts which I purchased after my first trip (and I never buy touristy paraphernalia).  Needless to say, I love this place and their sandwiches which I find reasonably priced compared to delis in NYC or Chicago.  The tables are communal so you'll most likely be sitting next to other tourists.  Side note, the first time I dined here, we sat next to three generations of Korean women (I am Korean):  a grandmother, mother, and daughter.  The server asked them \"do you want your sandwich to be lean, medium, or fatty.\"  The Korean women who did not understand English well answered \"uh, medium rare?\"  

I usually go medium or fatty.  Last time I went here, I went through the takeout line in the store next door (a way to avoid the lines for the main restaurant) and took that baby with me as I left Montreal.  I scarfed it down before I re-entered the U.S. as I didn't want to explain to the border agent that I was harboring smoked meat goodness from Canada.  

I know it is not the sophisticated answer but the sandwiches here so far are my favorite thing that I've eaten in my two trips to Montreal."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. It's delicious, it's well priced, it's a Montréal landmark, and you should come around 11-12 so you don't have to wait as long. The cole slaw was so different - refreshing. I made the mistake of sharing a sandwich with my friend - don't do this! You should eat as much as you can, because 2 hours later, you'll be wishing you had."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering just thinking about the tender beef. It is pretty expensive for a sandwich but the quality is incredible. Each piece packs a lot of flavor. 
Seating is very limited. there are probably 10 ish stools in the back. And be prepared to wait in line!"}
{"text":"Place to eat smoked meat in Montréal."}
{"text":"a must when i go around the area\" cannot beat any smoked meat place. ambiance is just great and noisy, you feel the pull. again and again' i will return"}
{"text":"Schwartz's is a Jewish Deli done right. No trip I ever took to Montreal was ever complete without chocolate croissant's from Duc de Lorraine and at least one trip to Schwartz's. Each piece of the smoke meat is a little piece of heaven. I am not even sure words can describe their meat, it is that good but I will try. The brisket has been smoked to perfection that it is super tender. Be sure to order the medium fat content on the meat, you've come to Schwatz's don't try to be sort of healthy. If you come with a group I recommend you order the smoked meat plate and a loaf of rye, that way you each get to make your own sandwich with just the amount of meat that each person wants. To go with your sandwich you must order the fries and the cherry soda. The line may be long, but the wait is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Passage obligé si vous venez à Montréal.

L'endroit est exiguë donc prévoir de venir y manger à un autre moment qu'à l'heure des repas LOL parce qu'il y a toujours une line up de fous! Enfin comme on dit plus c'est long, plus c'est bon! Et c'est vrai!"}
{"text":"Come to Schwartz for a local experience. 
It is a neighborhood deli feel, people behind the counter know their regulars and are very friendly. 
I recommend just starting with the smoked meat sandwich. It may seem like not much when you see it, but don't be fooled. Once you start eating you'll understand the beauty in it's simplicity :)
Add some fries with it and you've got a perfect meal!

This place is tight quarters and cash only, they've been open and running this way since the 30's and it's a beautiful thing!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff.  We came in late afternoon and were seated within a few minutes.  Very diverse crowd, intimate seating with friendly co-patrons at our table.  Even though they were busy, the owner made time to chat with us and made us feel welcome.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So good!  The best coleslaw I've ever experienced.  Not a creamy coleslaw so be prepared. We went at a good time so no line. The place is cramped but that's what happens when you have such high demand. My husband's only complaint was that the plates were too small for the amount of food given. He survived the small plate crisis."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there on a busy thursday afternoon. It is a no frills deli place that serves the best \"smoked beef\" (pastrami) I've had. The meat portions are humongous and they're fatty, juicy, and delish."}
{"text":"A Montreal institution - this place hasn't changed in years. That's part of it's charm and glory. A true Montreal deli, paper placemats and all! Highly recommend the fattiest cut of meat you can stomach, because it tastes like no other."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches sometimes there is the longest line I have ever seen, just for a sandwich.  It's worth it, I guess if you are from out of town, but it's boring to stand in a line alone, so bring someone to talk to so it's not so bad,  Also, instead of buying one, I buy 2.  Not because the portions being small, no they are big smoked meat sandwiches with lots of meat! It's just that they taste so good you will think about it later and wish you can taste it again, but then there is that super line."}
{"text":"When you do a shot of tequila, you go salt, shot, lime.

When you do Schwartz sandos, you go bite, mustard, pickle. (hint: Cut up the cornichon in bite size pieces and squeeze a bit of mustard onto your plate.)  Mustard adds some tang and pickle's acidity goes ha-YAH! Like Beatrix Kiddo slicing O-Ren Ishi's head.

This place got me into Jewish Delis which made me find Wise Sons in SF. I'm a Rookie to the Jewish deli scene so I still need to give Katz a chance to Pai Mei... Or not."}
{"text":"The sandwich is amazing...I was in vacation in Montreal, in the plateau area. I always saw a big line in front of the restaurant, then I solved to check. It is hard to avoid big lines to enter in the restaurant...But It's worth!"}
{"text":"schwartz's is slipping, i used to love schwartz's, it was one of my favorite places to eat in the world. but things have changed, a while ago i noticed that it didn't taste quite as good as it had in the past. i chalked it up to being a fluke, but in the last year i've been back four times and every single time the meat just hasn't been very great.. not only has it been quite dry on occasion, but there's no flavour anymore. it just doesn't taste like it used to, it's bland and boring. so much so that on two occasions i left meat on my plate when in the past i couldn't get enough and would probably have eaten scraps off the floor :)

i've tried the main across the street, it's no better, i've yet to try dunn's, crossing my fingers they've got that smoked meat magic."}
{"text":"The line can be long, but it moves pretty quickly. Service is fast and the food is never disappointing. I recommend trying their classic smoked meat sandwich with fries and a pickle!"}
{"text":"Being in Montreal for F1, ment that I had to try Schwartz. And I was not disappointed. except for the line. 

After a long wait, I got the smoked meat sammich to go, since seating was lacking. Once on the street, i chomped down on the meaty goodness in full view of the patrons in line. Perhaps that was a bit rude, but i'm Murican! Oh well!

Only regret was not visiting Schwartz when I first got there and not ordering more than two sammiches....next time i won't forget!"}
{"text":"I've never left disappointed or hungry.  Just the best!  Make sure you get a pickle with your sandwich!"}
{"text":"I missed my Schwartz's sandwich before I'd even paid my bill. I was sitting there, dejected, swirling fries in ketchup, and wondering how piggish it would be to order a second one. \"Maybe I could ask for a half size...\" I thought to myself. It didn't help that my boyfriend had just told me that on his first visit to Montreal, he saw a group at the next table order what was basically just a mountain of meat and a stack of bread. How come we didn't do that?? This is not on the menu, so if that sounds like something you'd be into, be sure to ask!

I went for the lean smoked meat, my boyfriend had the medium. I was undecided, especially since everyone on Yelp said recommendations from Schwartz staff dictate medium is best. Still, I'm more of a 'head-in-the-sand' carnivore. I'm happy to eat the juiciest of steaks, cooked to the raw-side of medium rare, as long as it's lean. As soon as I get a piece of fat or gristle to chew on, the true horror of what I'm eating sets in and I lose my appetite. So, for a theoretical vegetarian with the will power of a junkie in a meth lab, the lean was a perfect fit for me. Just juicy enough and the 'OMG -- adorable moo-moo cow!' factor was kept to a minimum. Bliss!

Just as an FYI, my boyfriend tried my lean sandwich and deemed it 'much drier than the medium' so take from that what you will fatty meat lovers.

This place is pretty damn cheap. Just a little over $20 for two huge sandwiches, an order of fries, a pickle the size of a peepee and two sodas. 

Definitely a Montreal must. If you like Katz in NYC, you will love this place."}
{"text":"We came here twice during our stay in Montreal and both times were awesome!  The meat was moist and tender and the liver steak was pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"Smoked meat is my jam so you know I was all up in this piece when I was recently in Montreal. The sandwich was so good. The atmosphere is awesome. A total old school diner throwback feel. So glad we sought this place out and walked all over Montreal just to get to it."}
{"text":"First and last at this hotel, simply put small room with small ants.
They definitely keep things equal"}
{"text":"Pretty good! But not that goodanyway it's a very famous restaurant and it's worthy of trying that~"}
{"text":"The FIRST review of this place?????  NO WAY!

This smoked meat sandwich is the best I've had.  It beats those famous delis in NY all to hell.  (Carnegie, Katz, etc.)

DAMN good.  Get a pile of lean smoked meat with a friend or two...bread on the side and begin.  Get a pickle that is so meaty that you may be more comfortable eating it with a knife and fork.  Get stuffed and get out!
After all....there's a line-up down the block."}
{"text":"The lunch queue was manageable, there are about 5-6 patrons ahead of us when we reached the smoked meat den. 

The staff came out to check on us, and getting a good gauge on the number of people waiting. We waited for 20mins before we are being ushered in. The eatery is small with long tables occupying 6 diners each time. We shared a table with 2 joyous couples, making the atmosphere more delightful.

The portion is good for one but we shared it out as there are simply too many places to eat for a tourist. The staff took our orders and he didn't sneer at us when we told him its sharing, the only time was when I told him I wanted a lean meat in my sandwich! He laughed and ask why Asian always wanted to eat something lean which he adamant says it will not taste good. He coaxed me into eating a medium-fat nature which he has succeeded. 

Indeed, u have to order either a lean or medium fat meat that are not too tough and drying out. I liked its smokey note and somewhat delicate but not entirely frail texture. The meat has a good balanced of smoked and natural meat flavour and less harsh in it's seasoning. The lightly toasted rye bread combines quite well, but I wish they could splatter more mustard sauce (seeds along) underneath my rye, anyway u can doubled it up since a bottle is made available on each table. HP sauce, tomato ketchup, salt and pepper is within reach if u need any of them. 

I had the cherry cott drink which some says are good. Sure enough, there wasn't traces of awful cough syrup hint in it though it says artificially flavored. But it's not an everyday occurrence, so why be bothered! 

The staff will comes around and pass u the bill which u could simply bring it to the cash counter next to the entrance. Service has been very prompt and polite. It's pleasant!"}
{"text":"Putting aside that this restaurant is very famous in Montreal and everyone recommend it, you have to be catious because the meat could be very very fatty. if you don't like fatty foods, remember to ask for lean meat."}
{"text":"Even after going around Montreal, it's still the best smoked meat I've had"}
{"text":"The line-up for this place is ridiculous.  And for what?  Dried meat on a dry rye bread with a slap of mustard.  Seriously, the hype for this place is greater than their food.  

The place is crowded and the decor is a little gross.  Their food comes fast and sloppy but cheap in price it is!  But if you want authentic Montreal smoked meat, I suppose this is the place!  Do yourself a favour though, take it to go; go back home or to your hotel room and have it on really nice bread with all of your favourite fixin's.  And if you take it to go, you can surpass the always ridiculous line-up."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic smoked meat sandwich, this is the place for you! The poutine is good too. This is a one - stop shop for authentic Montreal food."}
{"text":"The perennially long line ups had dissuaded me from coming before, but my in-laws and brother in law were visiting so we decided to grin and bear it to show off this supposed culinary gem. It was horrible. The meat was dry and had no taste, the mustard was overbearing, I got a big piece of fat with my meat which I had to spit out, and the bread kept falling apart. That said, the sandwich was relatively good compared to the fries, which were an impossible mixture of limp and burnt. Service was terrible too. We felt really embarrassed to have brought our family here, and we had to apologize all the way back to their hotel. We had ice cream on the way to forget the experience. I don't know how this place is so famous, it was probably one of the worst food experiences I've had."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches.  Love the medium fat smoked meat on rye, delicious!  My sister lives in Montreal and brings me a sandwich when she flies home, unbeatable!"}
{"text":"Great smoked meat on rye and mustard!  So good, bought some to take back home."}
{"text":"This restaurant is ridiculously busy....I passed by the other day in a stormy and rainy weather. There was still a line out the door.......I waited to get in and tried their famous smoked meat sandwich. It is decent with a mountain pile of meat. Good but I am not sure it actually worth the wait and the fame (the La Samgrass in Boston is so much better...) .......I am sorry, montreal Sandwich....."}
{"text":"toujours la file à l'entrée, ca en vaut la peine.."}
{"text":"I used to swear by their smoked meat years ago. However, after the deli changed hands, their smoked meat became drier than usual and lacks flavor. I really couldn't even finish my sandwich the last 2 times. One of the employees mentioned they are skimping on the spices now.

Their steak, coleslaw, pickles, cherries and stuffed chicken sandwiches are good. The fries are average.

Sadly I consider it more of a tourist trap now with unnecessary waiting lines. The service is rude at times and parking can be tough."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I thought it would be. Old school all the way and absolutely gives that NY delicatessen vibe. Cash only...as expected. Old school servers who are very polite and add to the experience of that deli we all know and love. The food was spot on. Hard to describe what sets the smoked meat apart from NY pastrami but it definitely was different and I have no idea which I prefer. It would be tough to beat Katz Deli in NYC but Swartz is right there with them. Basically if the name ends in a Z then you know you have a winner. Side note- take the waiters advice. Do it right. Get the smoked meat sandwich with fries, a pickle, and the black cherry soda. They recommend that for a reason. It's a classic and you don't mess with the classics."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointing, but still good enough for lunch. This place is arguably the most popular, most crowded tourist-trap in all of Montreal. The lines are extremely long the minute lunch starts. They have both a restaurant and a takeout section, but I would definitely recommend the takeout which has a shorter line and a few tables in the back for a quick bite. The prices are somewhat inexpensive, but their meat variety is extremely limited. The takeout line only took about 10 minutes, compared to the 45 minute line at the restaurant. If you don't like smoked meat, then go elsewhere. They do have turkey and salami, but from reviews, they didn't compare to the smoked meat. Anyway, the food was made really quickly and we were able to snatch a seat in the back of the restaurant. The smoked meat sandwich was not large by any means, but with fries or a pickle, it is somewhat filling. The smoked meat itself was nothing special; it sort of tasted like pastrami and corned beef, but didn't have any oomph of uniqueness. There was no elevating flavors that separated this smoked meat from any other place around Montreal. Anyway, this place is nice to try if in the area for a while, but if here for only a few days, I would pass."}
{"text":"It is all about the smoke meat - and yes it should be either medium or fat.  If you need to say lean, heart-wise, vegan, lo-cal, low sodium etc... this is not for you.  But if you can brave the line, do not mind being close with strangers and appreciate world-class smoked meat (where Montreal style smoked meat was born) then come and come often."}
{"text":"It seems funny to me how the best reviews on this restaurants are all from people NOT from Montreal...  I'm not saying its not good smoked meat. But seriously, unless you are a masochist and enjoy long waits and rude service, go somewhere else. Its not good enough to go through the ordeal of getting your food and getting kicked out almost before you are even finished. This is a tourist trap if I've ever seen one."}
{"text":"There is nothing like this place anywhere! Its always my first stop when I come to MTL. Its small and crowded yes but the smoked meat sandwiches are the best. I order mine medium (with a little fat on it), it comes with mustard and a big honkin' pickle. The fries are worth a try too if you're real hungry, they're awesome. The coleslaw is nothing special; not really worth ordering unless you really want it. If you're in Montreal you MUST stop by here."}
{"text":"You will wait a while and pay 10$ for a sandwich, but it is undoubtedly a really good sandwich. 

If you've never been it is definitely worth going once, as a local I haven't been in like a year though.."}
{"text":"When you see line ups before the restaurant opens, it's a sign that they are doing something right. Schwartz's is a very small, busy diner with a cult following. My waiter was excellent, giving us great advice as we settled on the combo which came with fries. We ordered the coleslaw and had pickles on the side. If the seating wasn't so crowded and follow diners dropping f-bombs, this establishment would have received 5 stars from me. You should bring cash as they do not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"It's hard to explain to anyone from outside of Quebec how \"Smoked meat\" is far superior to anything like Pastrami or corned beef. It's worth the trip. One of the best sandwiches in town. Don't be a wuss and order it on the \"fatty\" side..."}
{"text":"The meat melts in your mouth and the pickles are huge, what more can a girl ask for?  

If you don't like lines, or communal tables I suggest you head next door and get a sandwich or two 'to-go'."}
{"text":"I only went to the takeaway part of the store so I can't speak for the restaurant side. But the service was quick and easy, the smoked beef was to die for! Everyone should at least try it once and your want to go back for more!"}
{"text":"We always make an  effort to stop by if we pass by or stay in Montreal.

What can I say that hasn't been said before?
Great food, lots of tradition and full of interesting characters.
Keeping it simple is the way to go here.

Fatty on rye with muster, a dill pickle and a can of Coke.

If its your lucky day your wait for a seat is shorter than your meal.
Takeout is available next door at their newer shop, but it lacks the charm.  :-)"}
{"text":"Amazing. Very tasty, wish i could bring some to toronto."}
{"text":"Visited Schwartz's during our holiday to Montreal. The dine-in line stretched around the corner, so we opted for the takeaway, which was quick and efficient. It was a beautiful day, so we sat on the benches across the street by Ripples to eat.

My partner and I shared a medium fat smoked meat sandwich and fries (this was our mid-morning \"snack\") and enjoyed it. The meat was juicy and flavorful, and the fries were well seasoned (though slightly soggy). I'm definitely glad we tried Schwartz's while in town, but doubt I'd wait in line if in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Simple equation: rye+mustard+pastrami = deliciousness. And I agree that the black cherry soda puts it over the top. I don't ever drink soda, but there's something magical about smoked meat + cherry soda. I liken it to the friend or coworker who you thought was a health nut - whom you suddenly find bumming cigarettes off strangers at the club to have with their drinks... If your that person, you know what I mean. Again I say there's just something magical.

Many will also compare this place to Katz's deli, but this place does it right in terms of price as well as the meat to bread ratio of the sand which. 

Long line, but well worth the wait if your visiting Montreal. Locals already know this."}
{"text":"Montreal smoked meat is the best.  Pastrami and corned beef have nothing on this type of beef.  Schwartz is the pinnacle of smoked meat."}
{"text":"We headed to Schwartz's from Guy and Sherbrooke on foot after a long train ride from Toronto.  We arrived around 2:30 on a Friday afternoon and were quite hungry by that point.  When we saw the lineup that was 20+ people,  we almost gave up, but overhearing some of the raves from those ahead of us we decided to wait.  I'm glad we did as the line moved quickly, and once inside our food came even more quickly.  Listening to people in the line I ordered the lean sandwich and my husband the medium with fries and a pickle to share.  Sandwiches are basic, served on rye (ours were un-toasted) with a bit of mustard.  Everything was excellent.

My husband didn't really know where we were heading to when I took him there, and almost gave up once he saw the line, but left plotting to come back for one (or preferably all) of our remaining meals in the city."}
{"text":"Just thinking about this place makes me drool lol

The smoke meat is heavenly, now I know why my husband talked about it so much when we were in Montreal.

Everytime we went by Schwartz's there's a line up out the door passed a store's length. Make sure you go before 11am to avoid a line up. Even then, the place will still be half full during non-busy hours (I don't really know when is non-busy though, we passed by the place at 3pm and it was still crazy)

We ordered the smoke meat sandwich (seems like that's what everybody was having) with fries, cole slaw and coke. You can choose your meat to be lean, medium or fatty. We got medium and it was fantastic!! Fries were awesome too, personally I didn't like the cole slaw as much, it was too sour for me. 

If you are looking for quick, easy, good and cheap lunch, don't get side dishes coz they add up pretty quickly! Our bill ended up to be about $25.00, more expensive than we thought, but the sandwich was excellent ($6.15 for a sandwich)

Schwartz's should go Canada wide, we'd totally go again if there's another one in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Do I really have to post yet another comment? I think we all know. Just do it. Get the brisket. You know you want to."}
{"text":"WE ORDERED THE SMOKED MEAT SANDWICH WITH FRIES AND WE LOVED IT! 
Delicious and tender meat with some nice sides, the place is busy and not always you find a table"}
{"text":"About as classic as a deli gets, and some of the best meat you'll ever eat."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich was okay. I didn't think it was all that flavorful. The pickles were really good. There had been a long line out front but we only waited for about 10 minutes before an employee came out and offered us a couple of seats at the counter. The service was very good and quick."}
{"text":"Severely overhyped. We ordered from the counter, which I suppose is the only saving grace, as eating in would only have prolonged the tsuris.
It's like a smaller, less delicious, and more cranky Katz's Deli. I don't give a damn about cranky (I've been a New Yorker for most of my adult life), but if you're going to pull some b.s. attitude, please have some knockout product to show for it. Schwartz's does not. Montreal has more top-notch food than you can fit in your belly in a year, and none of it is here. Keep walking."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich at Schwartz is like.... It's not like anything - its every bit as delicious as the world says it is"}
{"text":"It's good food but way too crowded and smells horrible. I think it's not worth waiting in line for the experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the world's great sandwiches.  Yes it's small and crowded, but any good deli should be.  Yes, there's often a line - that is because it is so awesome.  Yes, tourists come here, but at the same time a ton of locals do as well.  To call it a \"tourist trap\" is ridiculous - for one thing, the prices are incredibly cheap even if though they could probably double them and still pack the place.  They could have opened a larger location or franchised it and made a bundle, but they didn't, because this place is authentic.  I guess it's not surprising that there is a hipster backlash, since there almost always is to anything good and popular.  

One word of advice would be to try to go during off-peak times, especially if you have a group larger than two.  I forget how late it's open, but I'd often head in late evenings or so and the place would be half empty.

Inferior to NYC pastrami?  Well I guess everyone's entitled to their opinion (even if it's wrong)..."}
{"text":"I don't get the people who underrate Schwartz any lower than 5 stars. The place is supposed to be everything that you're experiencing there:

-the sitting area is bustling, smells of food and loud
-service isn't the same as in any other restaurant. expect a little \"attitude\", but in a good way
-the guys behind the counter are great
-they get so many tourists so it makes sense that they may be expedient, especially at the cash register.

Places like Schwartz keep Montreal special and unique. Katz deli in NYC is twice the price and 2/3 of the taste."}
{"text":"I was aware of Schwartz's before my trip to Montreal and, in short, it's worth the hype. I was traveling alone so I was plucked from the line and given a seat at the counter. An older gentlemen was finishing off his Medium Smoked Meat sandwich and correctly pegged me for an out-of-towner. He very graciously offered his advice: they serve a lot of good food at Scwhartz's but there is only one meal to order: a medium smoked meat sandwich (as apposed to lean or fatty), an order of fries, a 1/2 sour pickle and a cherry cola. BAM! Incredible. On first inspection  the sammy appears huge. One doubts one's ability to take  it down. Fear not. The meat is so perfectly prepared that it just melts on the tongue. The taste, the smell, the sides, the salt of the meat and/or the pickle contrasting with the cherry cola. Wow. 
You won't have to eat much the rest of the day and have access to a steady supply of water. A lot of salt in that meal, you'll be thirsty. 
My dining companion/new friend and I savored every perfectly smoked, perfectly seasoned bite. A true culinary experience that I hope to have again some day."}
{"text":"My husband hates line-ups...but for one place he never complains...Schwartz's. He would fly to Montreal just to have a sandwich... He has considered asking them to Express Post a sandwich...I'll keep you posted...but I know to truely enjoy a Schwartz's sandwich, you must wait in line and eat it at one of the crowded tables where you are elbow to elbow with someone...maybe even the mayor or hockey player. I once hauled a $60 Schwartz's brisket on a flight back to Calgary -it was a surprise gift for my husband. I will never forget the look on his face when he unwrapped it! If you go in prepared they will have it wrapped and ready for you so it can go on the plane carry-on...seems like I am not the only one who does this..."}
{"text":"First time eating a smoked meat sandwich and it was phenomenal. Service was super fast and friendly. Great food. Go eat!"}
{"text":"We actually couldn't bear the line our latest trip to Montreal but I was extremely disappointed. They just opened up a separate take-out counter next door to eliminate some of the line/crowd. I recommend getting a loaf of bread, a bottle of mustard and a pound of smoked meat and going to town. I would like to note that every time I have been to Schwartz's it was with Montrealers so whoever said that locals don't eat here is wrong. They might be able to avoid the lines with timing but they can't resist the smoked meat."}
{"text":"I think I am banned from here.  Read on to find out why you should not be forced into the same situation yourself...

I guess first off, I should mention that their food is really as good as other reviews claim it to be.  The meat literally melts in your mouth, fries are as good as they get and the pickle is what you would imagine the perfect pickle to be. 

All was good in da hood.  Service was initially very good.  But it all went downhill when my friend finished his can of Coke.  We waited until our waiter came around, then he asked \"Sir, could I have another can of Coke please?\"  The waiter replied no problem, right away... then 5 minutes goes by.  Then 10.  Then 15.  20 minutes, and the dude does not come back with my buddy's Coke.  We were pretty sure he forgot by then, so when he came around again, my friend asked him for the Coke again (not rudely, but very politely as before).

Things started to go really sour from there... the guy started giving us the kind of screw face that only the old Eastern European dudes permanently carry around.  Then he muttered something in French, which we could kind of tell was an insult because the locals surrounding us started snickering.

Another 5 minuets passes by until the Coke finally arrives... slammed on top of the table.  WTF?  Why so much attitude buddy?

So by this time, we are pretty much done our meal.. we grab the can of Coke to go, and ask for the cheque.  Even though we waited 20 minutes for Coke, we receive this promptly.  The awesome part?  He followed by two finger taps on the table, with instructions to \"leave the tip here.\"

Hahahaha!!  I could not believe this guy!  I've seen some guys with big balls, but this guy has the biggest balls of all time!  You want me to leave you tip?  I have never in my life had anyone ask for tip before.. never mind by someone who gave us kiss my ass service.  So after having a chuckle at his face, I grabbed the cheque and paid the cashier.

Then we hit the sidewalks and started walking to our cars... out of no where, we start hearing some angry French speaking dude yelling at us.  We turned around, and sure it enough it is Mr. Big Balls himself.  When he had caught up with us, he had a copy of the cheque in his hand, and was doing math to figure out how much we should tip him.

My friend and look at each other and started bursting out laughing.  We turned around and kept on walking, while LOLing non-stop... and of course, we heard lots of follow up French cursing from the angry man.

Hey if the owners are reading this... control your people.  Your establishment is legendary, no argument there.  But your staff have that soup Nazi attitude because of your popularity.  And how ironic is that?"}
{"text":"By far the best Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich I've ever had! Nothing comes close to it! And you know it's good when it has its own musical named after it ... Also the staff are awesome and funny. I recommend it to anyone going to MTL!"}
{"text":"They may recommend the \"medium\" cut, but I would opt for the \"fatty\" version of their smoked meat next time, as this admittedly tasty but neither here-nor-there cut lacked the kind of mouth-drooling unctuousness I remember from my first encounter years ago.

The cole slaw is also a must, as the cool, crisp vinaigrette lends a perfect contrast to each savoury bite of smoked meat.

Also be warned re: the black cherry soda.  A recommended classic complement to the smoked meat sandwich, yes; but also strongly reminiscent of cough syrup, so perhaps better to skip if you're afraid drinking said soda will dredge up memories of being force fed medicine as a snotty nosed toddler."}
{"text":"Favourite thing to eat in Montreal. 
For best flavour, order the sandwich \"fat\"."}
{"text":"They know how to cook great meat, but not how to serve it. Humble interior, C+ service. Up the ante guys!"}
{"text":"Touristy TRAP, stay away! Cash only, extremely inconvenient! On a Tuesday afternoon at 2pm in December, we had to wait for 40min to get in. Little did I know, I was waiting all this long only to be disappointed. The staff here obviously knew that they are running the hottest sandwich stop in town and they sure act like they can't care less. This place is run by a group of old men who are extremely arrogant and make snarky jokes to their customers, which made me extremely uncomfortable. Food alone is not bad, but definitely not worth the wait and the attitude you are going to get from the staff. Dining is a whole experience to me and I will have to give it a 2 star and I sure won't return.I'd recommend everyone to check out Reuben's in town instead."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.

Sandwiches were just OK and nothing memorable at all. 

Maybe it's the best Montreal has, but I have had better a million times over.... Sorry Schwartz....... but you sucked."}
{"text":"Evidemment le meilleur smoked meat à Montréal.
Possibilité d'acheter la viande fumée Schwatz's également au supermarché.
Une très bonne place si vous venez visiter la ville en tant que touriste."}
{"text":"One of the best smoked meat I've had in a very long time. The key is in the taste and tenderness of their meat along with the simplistic menu. Give it a try and you'll love it. The sandwich is filling and has to be tried with pickle and peppers."}
{"text":"A classic. The lineup, the wait, the borderline rude service. It's all worth it, just for the one-of-a-kind experience. Don't hold back, and don't get the lean smoked meat."}
{"text":"I was only able to get cold meat because I came at 8:30 and hot meat wasn't available until 10:30. Man this was some tasty meat (that's what she said). Had a nice peperry bite and not too salty.  The hot meat is probably way better than the cold meat and if that's the case I would say it's worth waiting on the long lines I've read about."}
{"text":"Good food below average service. The price is very affordable which makes hard to complain about service quality. The only thing I really did not like is the long wait out in the street for a table. Overall, I would go back once in a while for good smoked meet."}
{"text":"great food ! quality! they make a mean sandwich and live up to their reputation/"}
{"text":"I don't know what to add that hasn't already been mentioned but this place is worth a visit. I had the smoked meat sandwich, medium, with poutine, a pickle, and black cherry cola. So good.I was tempted to eat there twice in the same day. Wish I had packed a cooler to take meat back...next time!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of smoked meat but this was a really great sandwich.
I would say it's still a bit pricey for a sandwich but compared to Katz' this looked like a steal.
The line was really long so we ended up ordering take-out and eating at a park down the street."}
{"text":"Authentic and a cultural icon. Not the best meat or rye bread available and you have to sit elbow-to-elbow with strangers who may not have the best table manners. Once was enough."}
{"text":"This MOntreal icon offers the best smoked meat in Montreal, great fries, and a casual and friendly atmosphere. Steaks and smoked turkey are also very good..."}
{"text":"With all the hype, we went here and I have to say, it was a'ight. 
Don't get me wrong they have good smoked meat but at the end of the day it's just smoked meat and it can get only so good."}
{"text":"Food is amazing (I always order a large platter with fatty meat). Why only four stars? Service is hit-or-miss.I once brought an American friend here and the service was so bad it really left a bad taste in his mouth... It's not the kind of impression you want to leave tourists visiting Montreal.

Also, do not order smoked turkey. In the spirit of Thanksgiving, we once ordered a small platter of smoked turkey. It was literally sliced cold cuts of turkey meat, the type you would expect to find in the deli section of your local grocery store."}
{"text":"Overhyped and not very good.  I'm probably just one the folks who just don't \"get it\".  There was nothing in the sandwich to make me think, wow, this is the best damn sandwich ever, and i'm gonna get my friends to come here.  If it wasn't an old establishment, I don't think folks would be giving his place a pass like they are.  Seriously, it's not that good."}
{"text":"I came here on a friend's recommendation. SOLID!

Be prepared to wait in line during lunch hours. If you want to avoid the wait, go in between rush hours. It is not a fancy joint. It does have its own character.

I had the smoked meat sandwich, mmmmmmm, the fat just melts in your mouth. If you get nothing else here, the smoked meat sandwich is it.

The fries is also worth a try."}
{"text":"NYC a son pastrami et Montréal a son smoked meat. Ne vous découragez pas par cette longue file d'attente! Vous n'allez pas regretter! Juste le meilleur smoked meat de la ville!"}
{"text":"Their smoked meat is one of the best in Montreal. It might take a while to get a seat and it's slightly expensive. But the meal is great, everyone's very friendly and the overall experience is entirely worth it."}
{"text":"Mine was fine - the line is longer the more people you want to seat next to each other.  Space is tight and for one or two people the wait isn't so bad, but it probably pisses off the groups of four a hell of a lot.

I thought it was an interesting, tasty experience.  And now that I've had it, I need no more to want.  it's just something you do once, really."}
{"text":"Worth the wait to eat the best smoked meat I've tried in Montreal."}
{"text":"I wish I could have brought this place back home with me!!! Incredible smoked meat, loved the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Ok, it was great. Smoked meat, pickle and cherry cola. Worth the line, and the calories!"}
{"text":"The things you need to know:
1. Cash only!
2. Food comes out quick. 
3. \"Liqueur\" means drink - not alcohol. Keep in mind this is coming from admittedly ignorant Americans in Canada. 
4. The french fries were fresh and delicious!

We were lucky in the sense that there wasn't a line. We went here after dropping out things after landing in Montreal. It was perfect because it offered fast, hot food."}
{"text":"Good smoked meat sandwich. The medium is pretty lean for what I'm used to in a pastrami or smoked meat so i prefer the fatty. Must get it with a pickle! Nothing goes better with this mound of meat and mustard than a pickle. Best to go to earlier in the week for an early lunch to avoid the long line."}
{"text":"Just moved to Montreal, so had to make a trip here. Jet lag and shell shocked from all the French, it was just what we needed. 

I don't expect to go here on a regular basis, surprisingly this style of meat is not my favourite. But it's a big tourist draw so anyone who comes to visit me will get a dinner there."}
{"text":"Amazing food ever . 
I have never see any smoke meat and steak like that . 

Price : the best
Food : amazing 
Location : hard to find the parking 
Resturant : not fancy and hell busy , always line up."}
{"text":"AVOID THAT PLACE !!! March 29 ' 2015. This is absurd ! It's way too expensive for the low quality of food. A very small sandwich (smoked meat) for $ 9.35 , small fries $ 3.15 a pickle : $ 2.10. The meat is tasteless. I do not understand why this place is so popular. I will no longer return to that place. It's ironic, but McDonald's is better and less expensive. Never Schwartz's anymore !!!

Évitez cette place !!! 29 mars 2015. C'est absurde ! C'est beaucoup trop cher pour la très basse qualité de nourriture. Un petit sandwich (smocked meat) pour 9.35 $, une petite frite 3.15 $, un cornichon 2.10 $. La viande est sans goût. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi cette place est si populaire. Je n'y retournerai plus. C'est ironique, mais McDonald's est meilleur et moins cher. Plus jamais Schwartz's."}
{"text":"Delicious smoked meat sandwich and pickle! Low key dive vibe. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the requisite smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle and black cherry soda and wasn't disappointed.  Excellent in every way and under $20. Admittedly, there's probably a deli in your neighborhood that's just as good but that doesn't take away from Schwartz's greatness. 

Heads up:  Rather than wait in a line the size of Texas, you can instead enter the second door, pay upfront and carry your food to the rear counter.  It wasn't very clean back there but I saved A LOT of time avoiding that long queue..."}
{"text":"It's all about the smoked beef.  Growing up in New York City the vibe reminds me of home.  It is a Montreal twist to a NYC style corn beef or pastrami sandwich with mustard, pickles, and cole slaw.  You need to pay with cash and it's not cheap, but not overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"came to montreal for vaca.

very long line only if you want to dine in.  

next door sandwich to go (there's also small seat in the back)

I ordered smoked meat sandwich.  Tasty, meaty and fatty.  just perfect with mustard.  I wish the portion a little bigger."}
{"text":"There are certain defining moments in life that we use to judge other physical experiences on this earth. With regards to my culinary experiences Schwartz's is that defining moment. I have never eaten a deli sandwich up to this day without comparing it to Schwartz's. There is no such thing as perfection, that is only for the God's, but this comes dangerously close."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not truly worth the line or hype."}
{"text":"Best piece of meat I've ever put in my mouth. (No pun intended) I'm the biggest sandwich connoisseur out there, and this stuff is amazing. I bought a side of slaw with it and put it in the sandwich. At first, I was a little disappointed w/ the size and menu options. However, they know what they are doing.The size was a little small, so just get two. Or better yet, they sell it by the pound. I should have gotten a few pounds worth to take back w/ me."}

y a lo mejor aprenden algo"}
{"text":"Smoked meat!  Expect a lineup. You can order some to bring back.

We had someone fly there and back just to deliver Schwartz for lunch before. That was an interesting experience. But my smoked meat was cold. Best to eat it when it's nice and hot.

If you're bringing it back home, microwave with a wet towel."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal and heard good things about this place, so was eager to try it out. Ordered their main sandwich for carry-out and, while delicious, was left a bit underwhelmed. I've had a number of Jewish deli (Carnegie's, Katz's) and in comparison, this one is similar but a lot more expensive at about $9CAD per sandwich. Serving portion was also pretty small."}
{"text":"Almost laughably good. I first went here for a smoked meat sandwich and a noch and a cherry cola! Wooh! Right across the street from a dive bar as well, and Schwartz's stays open late so make it you after bar destination! This deli competes with the best in NY and Philadelphia, Schwartz's is much smaller then one would imagine for such a great reputation."}
{"text":"best smoked meat in town but a little over priced 15$ with tip and that does not include fries or drink.  But well worth it."}
{"text":"I might have expected too much of this Montreal staple.  It's definitely a very popular place.  There's pretty much always a line waiting to go in.

We had 2 platters:  Combo plate and the chicken combo.  Both of which are served with fries, cole slaw and a pickle.  The cole slaw was good, especially for someone who doesn't usually eat cole slaw.  It wasn't the kind with mayo but tasted very refreshing and light.  My friends tell me the pickles were good and that it was sweet but I didn't get that when I ate it.

The combo plate was a plate of meat with different sections.  We got the medium fat one.  The fattier parts definitely tasted better.  Considering this is their bread and butter, I thought it was just okay.  Maybe it would have been better if I ate it as a sandwich.

The chicken combo had chicken and a little meat.  The chicken was the best thing on the plate.  It was very seasoned and done well too.  The chicken was the highlight of the place for me.

I think I was expecting the meat to taste better.  It was good but no wow factor.  

It's a small place so expect to be sharing tables with others and make some new friends :)"}
{"text":"Legendary smoke meat and at a affordable price, and amazing service, you haven't come to Montreal until you have tried schwartz's"}
{"text":"We had to come here because everyone spoke so highly of it. We got to Schwartz's and waited 15 minutes outside to get a table. Then when we finally got in it was crowded and we had two other people sitting at our table with us. They were friendly, no complaints. I'm not much of a red meat person so I passed on the infamous smoked meat sandwich. I had the coleslaw, a pickle, and French fries. All of which were very tasty. My family all had smoked meat sandwiches and loved it. However, the service was rough (probably because there are 35 people waiting to get in the door & they're trying to turnover tables ASAP) and the atmosphere was cramped. Overall, I think if you're in Montreal you should go, but maybe if you're down for a second round, takeout might be more enjoyable. OH. And cash only!!!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Montreal for school and of course one of the first places I went to experience the city was Schwartz's. The sandwich was delicious, as good as some corned beef that I had at small family owned New York deli's. The french fries we got on the side were also very good. Splitting the fries with two other friends and having my own sandwich was enough food for a decent sized meal. I would've expected slightly more food though from a smoked meat/corned beef place. Usually their serving sizes are especially large, but not here and that is the only reason for four stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"How can you not be a fan?

It's an institution.

Only complaint is sometime out of items from menu like poutine gravy... but if that is the worst thing in your life... you need to goto haiti for awhile"}
{"text":"I found my smoked meat nirvana in this little place which apparently is the most famous sandwich shop in the world and always compared against New York deli sandwiches. The sandwich was 2 slices of bread with layers and layers of smoked meat with mustard sauce. That's it. No more no less - proving that more doesn't mean better. If you are ever in Montreal - this is an absolute must visit place."}
{"text":"If you like meat, you will like Schwartz's. If you don't like meat, you'll wish you did.

After a short spell of erraticity, the Schwartz smoked meat is back among the gods of food, gracing us with its charming and addicting taste and its luxurious texture. Shall I mention the spices? 

You know your friend who always brags about the \"dining experience\" shtick? Get that shmegegge to Schwartz's. Elementary and efficient service in a cramped deli is the ideal backdrop to the simple and natural symphony of flavor about to play on your tastebuds.

My recommendation is to sit at the counter. I saw the guy who mans it until about 9.30-ish and he is hilarious. Skip the fries and the coleslaw, but go for the pickle and the smoked meat sandwich. Hungry? Have a large plate: they'll pack whatever you can't finish in one sitting.

Believe me on that one, you won't have the guts to. The large plate is enormous. And compared to the small plate it's a bargain.

My typical fare is smoked meat sandwich and a black cherry drink. Somehow it's just delicious.

When you are ready to go, leave your tip on the table for the server and pay your bill at the cash register. Check how much they surcharge for paying with USD, when it's at parity they will take greenbacks and give you Canadian change.

Now how cool is THAT?"}
{"text":"D'après le globe cooker Fred Chesneau (les nouveaux explorateurs, canal+) Schwartz est l'endroit incontournable pour goûter la fameuse \"smoked meat\". Après 30mn d'attente (un vendredi à 14h) nous avons pu obtenir une table pour vérifier son jugement. Première impression : Le resto à 80 ans, il a du être rénové plusieurs fois mais la dernière fois c'était il y a très longtemps... Une fois à l'intérieur, la prise de commande et le service sont très rapides. C'est vrai que la viande est bonne et ne ressemble à rien de connu (peut être un peu le gout du pot au feu). Vous avez le choix entre de la viande grasse ou sèche. J'ai pris de la médium sur les conseils de mes amis Québécois et du serveur, il parait que c'est de loin la meilleure. Pour conclure sur mon avis personnel, je dirai que Schwartz est une bonne adresse, un bon rapport qualité prix mais le sandwich ne justifie pas plus de 30mn d'attente, il faut pas pousser quand même.
NB : en caisse ils acceptent uniquement le cash."}
{"text":"Quality smoked meat, but slightly overrated and tourist-trappy. 

There's no denying this place is one of the culinary institutions of Montreal, and its brisket's hype is fairly well-deserved. But having lived around the corner for years, I never go.

Why? 

Well, any smart local scoffs (or laughs) at the massive line of people in front of Schwartz's. There are enough solid smoked meat joints in the city that lining up for more than 5-10 minutes seems absurd. \"Oh jeez, poor tourists\", you'll hear someone say as they walk past a line of 50+ people standing on the sidewalk during a sweltering summer afternoon. Schwartz's is good, but not THAT good. 

Combine the ridiculous line with the fact that both the atmosphere and service sucks, doesn't make for a place I yearn for (if you like blinding fluorescent lighting and being pushed out the door before you've finished eating, you might like it though).

If you do happen to find yourself in a giant line out front of Schwartz's, do yourself a favour...walk directly across the street to the Main Deli. You won't wait, and you'll find smoked meat that's just as good, with a chill atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"A lot of hype behind this place. I was expecting something amazing after waiting in a very long line. We did the take out. The customer service was incredibly rude. I would never go back here because of the employees."}
{"text":"The star rating says it all.... I've experienced better. This is supposedly the holy grail of must eat places in Montreal, but on each occasion, I was always left wondering... really? This is it?
Now, I LOVE smoked meat. I really do. It's a uniquely Montreal food that we have perfected.
The smoked meat at Schwartz's is fine. It's not offensive. The fries are ok. The ambiance is.... interesting. The service is downright poor, but then, that's also what they are known for.
I would definitely hit up this place if you are a tourist to have the full Montreal experience (long line-up included) but for me, as a local Montrealer, it's not somewhere I would ever willingly frequent."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great service and quick delicious food. smoked meat sandwich was incredible!"}
{"text":"Got the sandwich here and no one prepared me for the size of these things - they're huge and DELICIOUS. Got the pickle on the side, again, so good, and it goes great with the sandwich. I understand why people line up here!!"}
{"text":"The best smoked meat in montreal! The place is nice and it holds a lot of historical charm!"}
{"text":"It's one of my favorite restaurant in Montreal!  Love their smoke meat! The price is good and so much smoke meat!!!!!
Don't mind waiting their line to eat that smoke meat with homemade pickle love it!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 1 hour (cold weather). Staff not helpful. Horrible experience no matter how good it can be."}
{"text":"Best sandwich ever. I always eat 2 sandwiches here. Get 1 fat, 1 medium and a pickle. Heaven. Got a vacuum packed medium smoked meat home to Toronto next door in the take out section."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. The pickles are the best part of the experience. Sandwich was pretty good but will not go back."}
{"text":"Disappointing hot smoked meat from Schwartz's takeout counter in the storefront adjacent to the main Schwartz. Fatty cut by inexperienced or indifferent counter-men for takeout order of hot smoked meat. Meat was fatty, speckled and unappetizing. This is not the quality of Schwartz prior to its sale to new owner corporation. I will avoid and prefer the Main across from Schwartz's next time."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat in Montreal. Price is very reasonable for a sandwich that is loaded with meat. Try to avoid meal times as lines are extremely long. Be prepared to wait if you wish to sit down and eat. Definitely a place to eat on any Montreal visit."}
{"text":"OK guys.  

I have been eating smoked meat in Montreal my whole life.  This is a BRAND NAME but is not necessarily the best place ever. 

Go when you can avoid a line. 

Otherwise go across the street."}
{"text":"Une très bonne adresse pour les amateurs de sandwichs pastrami. Le lieu mérite sa réputation, j'y ai passé un moment agréable et savoureux.

Le sandwich est à tomber, faites le choix d'une viande maigre si vous le souhaitez digeste, et plus grasse si vous le désirez fondant. Accompagnez le de frites, choux et d'une canette de black cherry soda pour un moment 100% \"schawrt'sien\".

Aucune fausse note dans ce temple de la smoked meat."}
{"text":"Love the staff, love the meat, love the place. Prepare for a long line around lunch or dinner hours. 

They ask you how you want you meat, lean or something maybe, I can't remember. Just say you don't want it too fatty. 

Get a half sour pickle and a hot pepper. Hand cut french fries too."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches.  Pickle was the perfect combo with the fries and lean smoked beef sandwich. The smell from the kitchen was the only negative part of the experience."}
{"text":"My friend loves this place and has definitely spent a fortune eating here. It was only a matter of time before he dragged my not-from-Quebec butt to Schwartz's. 

I had honestly never heard of this place until a few months in when I moved to my second apartment in Montréal, just two blocks from Schwartz's. To be fair, I was never a big fan of smoked meat type foods. That being said, I tried their smoked meat sandwich and wow, that's a good sandwich. 

It supposedly took God 7 days to create the planet but who'd have thought it only takes 3 ingredients to create heaven? Bread, smoked meat, and mustard.

In all the time I lived by there, never have I ever seen it without a massive line outside."}
{"text":"This place was recommended on various online forum. We arrived there after noon and there was already a queue forming. Fortunately, the turnover was quick and we have our seats after about 15 mins. A new-comer would be slightly lost with how to order as the signboard display was simplified. My friend who has been here before ordered on our behalf for their famous smoked meat sandwich and coleslaw. The many posters on the walls served as interesting past-time while waiting for our order. The sandwich came with two small slices of soft bread but large portion of meat, which was tender and succulent enough but not too fatty. The coleslaw complemented it well. Though we did not feel pressurized to hurry through our eating, they offer take-away service too, which could make eating more leisurely and enjoyable. if have the chance, will return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Last time I went to Schwartz I was 13 years old.  Its been almost 20 years and its still awesome.  

The all you can eat side was just too busy, so went to the take out side (go this route if your not going to eat 2-3).  The line up was super fast and there's still a few tables to sit at in the back.

I'm sure I don't need to tell you, if your in Montreal MAKE THIS A STOP.  The meat is simply mouth watering and falls apart when you eat it!

Ate smoked meat at a couple other stops and it just wasn't as good or even close to the same."}

I eat here several times a month. Best smoked meat in Montreal."}

{"text":"Si vous êtes de passage à Montréal, vous devez aller au moins une fois chez Schwartz's pour goûter un des meilleurs smoked meat (viande fumée) !!!


 Avant de pouvoir en manger, il faut accéder à la salle et s'installer à une table (ou prendre à emporter). Et ne croyez pas que c'est facile, il y a toujours une bonne file d'attente devant l'établissement. En même temps ils ont une très bonne réputation donc prenez votre mal en patience.


 Bon ensuite vous êtes installés. Les tables sont serrées mais on fait avec, on est là surtout pour manger. Et bien sur pour la commande ça va être soit l'assiette de smoked meat, soit le sandwich... ça change pas énormément en fait. Il y a d'autres spécialités que je n'ai pas pu essayée et puis moins intéressantes.


 J'avais pris le sandwich... alors deux tranches de pains et entre les deux tranches une montagne de viande !! un peu difficile à manger ^^\" Mais c'était excellent et puis il y a un peu de moutarde au miel ce qui rend le tout super bon. Si vous commandez l'assiette, il y a des tranches de pains pour que vous ne mangiez pas seulement la viande. On peut accompagner le tout de frites, coleslaw ou de cornichon (le gros cornichon américain/canadien, pas les petits qu'on sert en apéritif en France) Pour ma part j'en ai pas pris car les sandwich et les restes de mon cousin suffisaient largement.


 Le service est rapide mais pas expéditif (et puis quand j'y suis allé, il y avait un petit jeune assez mignon). Les prix sont corrects et la nourriture est bonne. A essayer impérativement si vous êtes de passage à Montréal !"}

O Schwartz é assim. Uma carne que derrete na boca, temperada no ponto, pode ser servida como sanduíche ou em prato aberto (o q comi). 
Recomendadíssimo pra mim e, agora, por mim."}
{"text":"1926 & still going strong. Not sure how we lucked into just a 5 minute wait for a group of 8 but we did thanks to the waiters rearranging a few people. Just do yourself a favour & order the medium- melt in your mouth! Perfectly-puckering pickles cut the richness of the meat. Portions are reasonable- you won't leave hungry but they aren't obscene either.Cherry cola to wash it all down and you're good to go."}
{"text":"We went here with the French side of the family after a decidedly touristy afternoon. There was a short line, but the 5 of us got in quickly, and were seated immediately. Our waiter was a quirky but funny older fellow who was full of jokes and great recommendations. The hubs and I were going to share a sandwich, but our waiter told us that one of us would probably starve if we did so. He was right, the sandwiches look big in the photos, but are more suited for one person instead of two. We also ordered the fries and the cherry soda everyone raves about. I was pleasantly surprised!! Normally when I order smoked meat like pastrami or corned beef, it has too much peppercorn flavor or is too salty. This was NOT a problem here! The meat was tender, tasty, juicy and perfect. You can even decide how much fat you want! I was so hungry that I devoured the meal in less than 20 minutes. That is a record for me because I like my meals to be nice and slow. Good company, good food, and good prices makes this place 5/5 stars!"}
{"text":"It's a busy, old school deli with service is exactly what it needs to be - efficient. Once you get a seat - prepare to wait in line - your order is in front of you 5 min tops. The smoked meat sandwich is delicious. I wish I had more time to explore some of the other items on the menu. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went there last night around 9:30 pm for the first time.  I have to admit I was a bit disappointed.

Smoked meat sandwich was good, but definitely not the best one I've had. Very very fat, and not a lot of flavor. 

On the good side, service was great, extremely fast, and I love that they kept their 50-60's restaurant style. I didn't wait to get seated, but it was 9h30 pm a tuesday night.

Overall, a bit pricey, not so flavourful, and overrated in my opinion, but still good."}

Simply:
5/5 Service
5/5 Smoked Meat
5/5 Price

Maybe the ONLY critique I have is that this place isn't larger (for dine-in).

Just perusing through these pictures is enough to make me salivate. I'll be back for you, Schwartz! :D"}
{"text":"Schwartz's Deli consistently tops Montreal's foodie list for good reason.

There is a take out section as well as dine in, both of which generally have fast-paced lines.
Extremely cute, little environment with friendly and attentive (despite being incredibly busy) staff.

We opted for the Large Plate of Smoked Meat, which comes with sliced bread for you to stack your own sandwich. You get the option of lean, medium and fatty for your meat as well! We chose the fatty option, which you can fully indulge in without feeling sick - the meat is incredibly tender and the fat contrasts with the bread for a great texture.

Definitely worth a visit if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Une institution montréalaise, très vivement conseillée par notre hôte locale. Il fallait absolument que nous testions le \"meilleur smoked meat sandwich d'Amerique du Nord\". (Il paraît même que Celine Dion et son R'né ont racheté ce mythique comptoir..!)

Quelle aventure culinaire pour 2 petits touristes français fraîchement arrivés...!! On se retrouve avec, dans la main, 2 petites tartines de pain blanc coupées en 2, largement garnies de morceaux de viande ressemblant à du rosbif bien gras, le tout assaisonné aux pickles. Après un bon moment à réfléchir par quel bout le prendre (pas du tout évident pour les non-initiés...!), on croque. Et là... Il faut aimer !

Côté prix : environ 9 dollars pour une sacrée part de viande. On peut ajouter des frites et une boisson. L'endroit propose aussi une poutine smoked meat. Nous n'avons pas osé... Mais le groupe d'Americains qui nous précédait en avait l'air ravi !"}
{"text":"We waited about 10 minutes for lunch. As soon as we got inside, the service was very fast. The meat was scrumptious. We ordered a large plate that came with bread and shared it between us two. The fries were very good. Cherry cola is a must! 

Schwartz's is a quintessential Montreal experience!"}
{"text":"I was setting my expectation quite high for its reputation. Friendly service, good food,  however not overly impressive! Not a bad choice if Montreal smoke meat is in your checklist for the trip."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich was good- the bread is only mediocre and not the slightest bit toasted although I wish it was. The high pile of meat is the star. I found it a tad dry, but still delicious. It came with a smear of mustard- I added more. I like the simplicity; you don't need to cover things up in sauces and spices if the main ingredient has quality to show. But it wasn't perfect.
Their fries were good, not over salted or greasy. I did really like their slaw- vinegary rather than mayo drenched, which perfectly cuts through the fattiness of the meat. I even piled some on into my sandwich.
The rib steak here is even better- get the Schwartz's combo and you'll get a nice fatty and flavorful steak, smoked meat, and a little cut of a tasty sausage, with slaw, fries, and a pickle. They did cook the steaks a bit more than what was ordered, they aren't thick steaks however: medium came out as medium-well, and the medium-rare found its way to the table as medium, but still equally delicious, and I did try them both.
Their liver is overcooked completely. The liver I do not recommend- dried out and far from how liver should be.

There is a wait, a line that can extend outside and down the street, and the three of us shared a table with a party of two, but I think it's what makes the place. There's nothing pretentious about it- this place is a dirty little diner. Our waiter was delightful. When I asked for fries, a pickle, and slaw, he only put in the pickle. \"Share\", he told us, \"there's plenty of food\". The combos come with slaw and fries by default. He was right, although we did finish EVERYTHING! I'm a small girl which can be deceiving; he underestimated my appetite.

I'm not saying you should drive to Montreal for Schwartz's, but all in all, if you're in Montreal, I recommend experiencing this place at least once."}
{"text":"Fast service on a Friday night. We only waited about 10 min for a table. Sandwiches are small and the turkey was surprisingly delicious!"}
{"text":"Best smoked meat in town! Well worth the waiting line and the cramped dining room!"}
{"text":"Que dire de plus?....C'est tout simplement le meilleur smoked meat de Montréal! 

Ce n'est peut-être pas l'endroit le plus moderne, mais la qualité est vraiment dans leur célèbre sandwich. Accompagnez-le avec un bon gros cornichon au vinaigre et c'est parfait! Des articles faisant l'éloge du restaurant tapissent les murs et cela ajoute un petit côté pittoresque à l'endroit :-) N'ayez pas peur de la file devant l'établissement, votre patience sera grandement récompensée."}
{"text":"I personally think this place is over rated! Yes it has history and is most definitely known worldwide and has been acquired by Celine Dion which could be appealing for some but still it's okay!

This review is not quite up-to-date since I am no longer a meat eater but I can still provide my honest opinion for those who want to go and get their Deli fix. Back in the days, I had personally tried tons of other smoked meats (in Europe & USA) and there was not 1 but few places that had better tasting smoked meat than Schwartz's. 

One thing that upset me so much is that when I went, we weren't sure which combo option to go for so the waiter suggested the big plate version (so we could share he said). This option not only costed more than the original option we wanted but they ended up charging us 3$ more on the bill for sharing a plate?!? It was a bit sneaky, since no where on the menu was this mentioned, nor did he (the waiter) mention it and HE had suggested this plate so we could share. At the end, we could've each had what we wanted to begin which would've cost the same price as the 1 plate he had suggested with the extra fee's. Just for the lack of honesty, we never went back! 

I wouldn't go anymore for obvious reasons but even if I was still eating meat I wouldn't go back. 

Pro's: 
- Well located in a happening spot of Montreal (Plateau)
- Probably an iconic diner spot to try on your Bucket List (Still over-rated)


Con's:
- Service seems dishonest, not a personal opinion but from what I read with other peoples reviews as well
- Not too many choices
- Very small sitting & borderline clean..."}
{"text":"This place serves the best smoked meat sandwich ever! Order the medium meat which has the perfect balance of protein with just a hint of fatty goodness, a side order of pickle, plus a cherry cola and you're good to go! This place is buzzy and busy just like New York, and usually there's a long line right outside. To skip the line, go to their take-out counter right next door and there are stools, plus a garden, that you can seat and enjoy your sandwich while everyone else waits and waits. 
Schwartz's opens late so it's also nice for a midnight snack."}
{"text":"Schwartz's was my first introduction to Montreal smoked meat and I must warn you - believe the hype, all of it.  Internalize it and immerse yourself in the spicy, smoky goodness.  

The meat is tender, tasty, and as fatty as you want it.  The sandwiches are simple and for those of you who like it naked, I admire your reverence for the meat in it's native form.  Otherwise, no whining about auto-mustard.  If you are disappointed by the lack of other toppings, you are missing the point.  It's all about the meat!!

The fries are a little on the soggy side, but again, you didn't come for the frites. However, be sure to grab a pickle and some peppers.  They are super tasty.

The service was very good both times that I went, quick and courteous.  There was even a little banter.  For this type of place, perfection!"}

{"text":"LOVE this place. Was in Montreal for a weekend recently and had to hit up this place and get my dose of medium smoked meat sandwich with pickles. Had to wait in line as usual but it was well worth it. Remember if you're planning to eat inside, have enough cash on you because that's all they accept. If you decide to get take out (you have to use the side door on the left if you decide to do that, which will save you from waiting in line for half an hour) then you can pay with cash / credit / debit. May I also suggest you get a sealed / packaged pack of meat on your way out after you're done eating because you're gonna crave more of this meat after a few hours. While the packaged meat is a bit thinner, and not AS good as the fresh stuff they serve at the restaurant, the meat is still pretty decent! They pack all packaged meat the same morning so you can be sure it is quite fresh and they last about a week in your fridge, but I assure you will eat them well before then.  Bon apetit"}
{"text":"There is a reason why there is a lineup for this place: the food is amazing.  The smoked meat sandwich and cherry cola is a good combination."}
{"text":"Awesome smoked meat, with a greasy-spoon decor and quick service."}
{"text":"Ordered: poutine, pastrami sandwiches, dill pickle and cherry coke. Food was delicious!! The cherry coke as recommended really did complement the sandwich. Poutine was mouth watering. Service was great. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"What a special treat to come upon this place just getting into town. We love historic places especially when they keep them the same. The volume of meat they do is amazing,and it's consistent. The family is doing a great job running it. They know what you like and bend over to please."}
{"text":"Un classique.
Tout simplement les meilleurs smoked meat en ville!"}
{"text":"First time and I absolutely loved it! Had to split a second sandwich because of how tasty it is. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Never heard of smoked meat sandwich ever before today, this place is unpretentious and serves great tasty food. The dinner was packed when we came I'm which is always a good sign, I only realised how popular this place was when we left and so folks queueing to get in. Overall it is an experience I loved, the service couldn't be faulted and it was reasonably pricedy."}
{"text":"I know this is THE place to come for Montreal smoked meat and I don't think it will disappoint you. There's a reason they are so popular. I think it's just too fatty for me. Maybe it was just my sandwich but last time we visited I don't remember it being so fatty. The pickle was pretty sad too, more squishy than crunchy. The fries shouldn't be the star here but they were this visit. I hate to give 3 stars but I know they can handle it."}
{"text":"Overrated. 

The meat is a bit dry, the place is filthy and the waiters shout at each other. I seriously don't get what all the fuss is about. I've had better smoked meat at my local pub.

Do yourself a favour, just pretend you've eaten at Schwartz's so people will stop bugging you about going."}
{"text":"The sanwiches are consistently delicious! You have to order the medium and not lean but every bite is amazing. A MUST!!"}
{"text":"It's always hard to meet your expectations when there is so much hype around a place.  Came here on a Wednesday night in August for takeout.  Got the smoke meat sandwich and returned to our airbnb which was five minute drive away.  

Thoughts:
- the meat could be a little more tender and flavorful
- did I forget to add extra mustard? 
- looked small but still a hearty meal. 
- I might prefer Katz' in NYC 

As with  all food it probably would have tasted better had I sat at the table and eaten there. Might give it another try when I return to MTL,  maybe..."}
{"text":"Schwartz's has very good smoked meat. but the line-up is unbearable. You could go to Main's right across the street and get the same smoked meat with a cheaper price and best of all. Less line-ups"}
{"text":"Schwartz's c'est typique, c'est bruyant, c'est rustique, c'est bondé et c'est GÉNIAL! J'ai eu ma toute première expérience l'automne dernier à la fin d'un tournage. On cherchait quelque chose de spécial et nous nous sommes retrouvé devant une longue file d'attente... Mon chum m'a dit: \"ça te dit d'enfin l'essayer?\" et j'ai tout de suite répondu par l'affirmative.

J'ai tout simplement adoré! J'ai adoré l'ambiance cacophonique, le serveur pressé, mais courtois et amusant, le style très New Yorkais, très Woodie Allen, le fait de manger à côté d'inconnus, la décoration très vieillotte et imprégnée du passé et surtout, le SMOKED MEAT! Ouuaahhhh il est trop bon!

On m'avait conseillé de prendre le medium, chose que j'ai faite et nous avons aussi commandé des cornichons, des frites, de la salade de choux et des coca-cola pour avoir le repas le plus typique qui soit. Tout était délicieux.

Il n'y a qu'un seul petit hic qui ne m'a pas fait mettre 5 étoiles: on gelait! C'était pendant l'été indien et il faisait chaud, mais pas tant que ça quand même... La climatisation fonctionnait à plein régime et les gens mangeait en grelottant. Dommage... Cela a quelque peu nuit à ma superbe expérience chez Schwartz's."}
{"text":"Okay but not mind-blowing; friendly staff, packed/cramped interior. Came here (out of our way) because of a high recommendation from a friend and also the starred review in a guidebook. If you don't have old-school delis where you're from, then this may be a novel treat. (We have Izzy's where I'm from and I think it's way better.) The smoked meat referenced in the menu is corned beef. It had a nice flavor but was a bit more dry than I'd like. Fries are okay--what you would expect and complement the meat well. The show stopper for me was the large pickle--with it's subtly sweet but highly vinegary taste. Seems like the kind of place locals learn to love from early adult experiences (could see this as good hangover food), but if it's out of your planned itinerary, I suggest skipping."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????10CAD???????????????"}
{"text":"Smoked meat, kosher pickle and black cherry soda. Follow the three steps and your guaranteed a satisfying meal. And the only way to enjoy Schwartz's smoked meat. 

Schwartz's is the oldest deli in Montreal. The lines are always long.
They're famous for their smoked meat with blended herbs, unique spices and marinated for 10 days. The result, strong smoking meat!! 

To spot this deli. You'll see a big sign \"Charcuterie Herbaique\" The meats are strictly kosher. It looks a regular old deli.  *CASH ONLY* 
It will be a nice experience just to eat your sandwich here.  

It's too crowded and loud. You have to scream and
sign language with your friend. This is something that you have to try!"}
{"text":"Very juicy smoked meet. I ordered the regular and my husband ordered lean meat. Both are really good. Make sure you order #4"}
{"text":"Puede que el de Schwartz's no sea el mejor sándwich de Montreal, pero es sin duda el más famoso. Así lo demuestran los cientos de recortes de periódico colgados de sus paredes y la cola interminable que hay que hacer antes de sentarse a la mesa. Y es que esta pequeña charcutería hebrea, que lleva abierta desde 1928, es más recomendable como atracción turística que como restaurante. 

Puestos a vivir la experiencia en su máximo apogeo, sugiero pedir un sándwich de carne ahumada acompañado de patatas fritas, un pepinillo, ensalada de col y bebida gaseosa de cereza. Eso sí, puede que salgas rodando por la puerta... ¡pero un día es un día!

*Nota para los impacientes que hartos de esperar la cola de Schwartz's se plantean comer en The Main, la competencia al otro lado de la calle: No lo hagas, no es lo mismo. Es preferible que pidas un sándwich para llevar y lo comas en el parque Jean Mance."}
{"text":"This is the first time we had smoked meat in Montreal. It is a must try. It is so delicious we almost went back for a second time. The lineup is totally worthwhile. We ordered the sandwich version and the build your own version with the same type of meat (medium). The build your own version of the meat was moist and more tender."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to admit it as a native Montrealer... But today was my first time at the famous Schwartz's. But, we waited outside in the cold in line for about 45 minutes, so I think i should be forgiven :) The decor is what I imagine it looked like when it first opened 80 years ago, minus some of the newspaper clippings on the walls.
Everyone at our table had a classic smoked meat sandwich - I ordered lean and found it a little dry, so I added a touch more mustard. Those who had medium said the meat was perfect. The spice combination used here is different from what you'd find at other smoked meat places around the city.  The meat is flavourful, tender, and falls apart. The fries were good.  
The star of meal, you ask? A giant pickle! Quite possibly the best pickle I've ever had (and I consider myself a pickle connoisseur, even if nobody else does). I wanted to stop next door at the take out counter to bring some pickles home, but the take out counter was closed. So I'll be back - the pickle is worth waiting in line."}
{"text":"Its great and big. The place was crowded and there were lines. It is definitely a local place. We had the famous plate."}
{"text":"I don't get this place. I'll still probably eat again at this place. Whatever you order get a cream soda."}
{"text":"It's expanded a lot, and lost a lot of it's charm in the process. With that said, smoked meat as good as ever. And they do a really unusual chicken. Trust me: get some smoked meat by all means, but the chicken is not to be missed--a standout and one-of-a-kind in a town that has good smoked meat all over the place. It's one of the most unusual and best things I've ever tasted. (Coated in pepper, kinda prepared similar to the smoked meat, but served whole.)"}
{"text":"I know Montreal smoked meat is just that - Montreal smoked meat, a thing of its own, so forgive me for trying to liken it to what I know, but for the sake of fellow Yelpers, I would say the meat tastes like a hybrid of bbq brisket and pastrami. You must try it with the black cherry soda; it pairs very well w/the sandwich. I think the medium fat option has plenty of marbled fat, so the fatty option might be too fatty for some."}
{"text":"Overated..
Food is ok, it may be famous but its definitely not the best smoked meat place in montreal..
The service is really bad and the wait is awful."}
{"text":"After reading all the millennial outrage blogs about waiting in long lines with the common non-hipster people, no booze and that all smoked meats taste the same except except if there is a designer name for the spices, I was hesitant to give it a try.  Just ignore all those reviews! 
I finally walked by on a weekday, and without a line outside, I sat at the counter for lunch.  The meat was awesome!  Tastes like the seasoning infused trimmings from a prime rib roast except that it was moist and tender.  No mustard or anything else was necessary.  You have to eat some of the meat before you can close the sandwich and hold it.  
After bleh-ing on all the other chain places didn't know that this was supposed to be how a real smoked meat sandwich was supposed to taste.
So if you coddled hipsters want to stay at your phoney micro brew (everything's sourced from Molson's anyways) for your flavoured ham sandwiches.  There will be more opportunities for me to have another great sandwich!"}
{"text":"Ich hatte im lonelyplanet Montréal von Schwartz's gelesen, und als Fan von geräuchertem Fleisch war ich natürlich mehr als bereit dazu, spätabends einen Abstecher zu dem nur wenige Straßen von unseren Hotel entfernten Lokal zu machen. Es war zwar schon 23.00 Uhr, aber trotzdem gab es eine Schlange bis hinaus auf die Straße. Ich entschied mich für ein Sandwich mit mittlerem Anteil Fett im Fleisch (man kann zwischen wenig, normal und viel Fett wählen) da es doch recht spät war. Ein Sitzplatz war nicht in Sicht, also nahm ich das Sandwich mit, konnte auf dem Heimweg aber dem aufsteigenden Geruch aus der Papiertüte nicht widerstehen und kostete nur ein kleines Stückchen. Mit dem Resulat, dass ich fünf Minuten später wieder in der Schlange wartete und mir sofort ein zweites kaufte. Das Fleisch zergeht einem auf der Zunge, unglaublich gut gewürzt, und die dezente Menge an Senf ... ein wirkliches Geschmackserlebnis! Das zweite Sandwich wurde sofort nach Ankunft im Hotel verputzt, dafür musste ich am nächsten Morgen aber auf mein Frühstück verzichten :) Schade dass wir nur kurz in Montréal waren, denn ich hätte gerne auch die anderen Gerichte auf der Karte probiert ... aber man darf ja noch träumen :) Wenn ich jemals wieder nach Montréal kommen sollte - ein Besuch bei Schwartz´s ist ein absolutes Muss!"}
{"text":"A must when on montreal.

Pros: the best smoke meat you will EVER have in your life!
Cons: the line up is ridiculous, waited over 1hr for a sandwich! WTF!

Would definitely come back, next time i'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I don't get it. It's the one Montreal place you have to take tourists but it is rather bland. if you want a great Smoked Meat sandwich just cross the street to Main Deli. That's a tasty smoked meat, and best part there is usually no line."}
{"text":"One of those rare occasions in life where something so highly rated not only lives up to the reputation but actually exceeds it.

I'm serious about my my stacked sandweeches, and this place is the benchmark. For such a crazy busy place, the staff is actually super friendly and helpful. Go here now."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich, quite basic : bread, mustard and smoked meat. 

Meat was good, but I expected a more sophisticated sandwich 

Good atmosphere, à little bit of wait to eat inside"}
{"text":"Smog check place was very efficient and friendly, had a coupon was a great price!"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for a wedding and eating excursion.  Before heading back, we stopped at Schwartz's for some brunch. 

The place is busy.  Line was out the door, but the turnaround time is quick. We waited in line around 10-15 mins before we got seated. The dining area seating is cafeteria style.  It gets packed.  You will make friends.  

We ordered the sampler meat plate to share and also the bbq chicken.  The meat plate is disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it's fresh.  But I guess it's not seasoned because I've tasted much better elsewhere.  The bbq chicken was good however I was worried because it was precooked and reheated on the grill.  I was afraid it would be dry, but they did a decent job of keeping it moist. 

Overall, not memorable. But it's a Montreal staple, so I guess you have to just go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Fantastic, a short wait to be seated at a community table, quick service. Not too patronizing of the tourists.  The food was great, awesome sandwich that went great with their homemade mustard.  This is a must in Montreal."}
{"text":"Schwartz. was ok. Would not go out the way for their sandwiches. Compare to NY'S FAMOUS Katz's Schwart's is not as tasty and juicy. also they charge extra for the pickles!"}
{"text":"I love these authentic smoked meat, amazing quality, so yummy and great staff., the only inconvenience is the line up :("}
{"text":"A visit to Montreal is not complete without having a smoked meat sandwich.  During my recent visit I took a public transit bus all the way to Schwartz's one evening just to enjoy one of their legendary smoked  deli sandwiches.  

It was almost midnight when I arrived so it wasn't too busy. The line ups had died down but the place was still in full swing taking care of the late nite crowd.  We were seated quickly and introduced to our waiter, who like the other waiters and staff here probably had 20 years of seniority .  They are no-nonsense waiters.  Order your food and don't ask for BBQ sauce.  You can definitely say there is old world charm here because it doesn't look like they have done any updating over  the years. But who cares, it only adds to the ambiance and actually gives the place more charm.

The menu extends beyond the smoked meat but it looks like everybody orders the same thing, Why would you want anything else? Of course we each had the legendary smoked meat sandwich on rye, a plate of fries, pickles and a bottle of cream soda.  

The meat is very moist.  When you bite into a piece that has more fat, you really enjoy the juiciness and flavor of the brining. The hand-sliced meat stacked on rye bread with a squirt of mustard is heaven for a carnivore like me."}
{"text":"My favourite smoked meat in Montreal. To eat with a Cherry Coke!"}
{"text":"This place has definitely a little bit of hype to it, it's like a tourist place rather a restaurant, a must eat for Montreal.  I'm sure there are other similar places in Montreal but this seems to be the most popular.

This place is really for quick in and quick out, it's pretty busy and tight in there but the staffs are really nice.

Not sure why they take cash only, definitely a big inconvenience.

The sandwiches are good but I mean they're not out of this world.  Reasonably priced.

This place is not baby friendly, it's loud and it's tight."}
{"text":"Order the smoked meat sandwich with medium fat. The juiciest I've ever had. Wish i can take some home with me!"}
{"text":"My husband (the American and stingy with his stars) has had his fair share of NY deli meats (pastrami/corned beef) so I was a bit nervous about bringing him here since for me their smoked meat is simply the best. He tried it and loved it! So much so that we had it again before we left Montreal, but this time taking it out (don't let the long lines ruin your experience!)."}
{"text":"Had some great sandwiches at this place. The counter staff was very nice and explained the ordering process to us, and kept checking to make sure we were satisfied."}
{"text":"Came here after reading all the great reviews. Came around noon and was promptly seated at a table that we ended up sharing with another group. Our server was very nice and the food came out quickly. Smoked meat sandwich with some fat is definitely the way to go. The meat practically melted in our mouths and was absolutely delicious. Would definitely come here if I ever come back to Montreal and highly recommend everyone and try it at least once. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Childhood memories and I'm starving!..no comparison. Always great. A delicious finner after a long..long day...if you have never been here it's a must."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich is so ridiculously tasty! Doesn't look like it would be, but once it's in our mouth you wonder if you could just eat at schwartz's everyday for the rest of your life."}
{"text":"As a self employed, single, childless dude I have very few responsibilities. However, going to Montreal at least once a year exclusively to eat at Schwartz's and pick up a dozen dozen bagels is something I take very seriously. 

There are really only two things you'd want to get here and that isn't because the rest of the menu is poor, I'm sure it not, it's merely for the fact that the smoked meat is just that good. 

If you're a sandwich lover (and if you're not, we're just not going to get along, don't bother contacting me in any way) order the medium fat smoked meat sandwich with fries and a pickle. If that doesn't sound like enough food for you it is, but if you don't trust me go ahead and order the coleslaw as well. It's average. But don't worry, you won't need to eat more than a forkful of it anyway.

The smoked meat sandwich however, is anything but average. We're talking about a mountain of thick cut, beautifully marbled brisket piled between rye bread and some appropriately plain yellow mustard. There's usually enough meat on each sandwich that you'll want to take a bit off and eat it with a fork and knife but even if you think you can open your mouth wide enough keep the fork as some of the meat is guaranteed to fall out. One bite and you'll realise what the 80 year old hype is all about. This is meat like no other. MUST be tasted.

The fries are a nice compliment and the pickle is enormous and juicy as a mofo. Not crunchy like you'd expect but definitely one of the better pickles I've eaten (though I hear good things about the Moshies pickle just up the street). 

If you're on the Atkin's diet, I'd suggest the smoked meat plate which is literally a plate of the smoked meat. That's too decadent even for me. It's common for people to order a loaf of rye bread with this and just build there own sandwiches, in fact, the last time I was there I saw a dude polish off 3-4 handmade sandwiches in less time than it took me to get through my sandwich. Fat ass. 

One thing you can definitely expect is a wait. Located on St Laurent in the Plateau, you can expect a 10-40 minute wait. The lineup is certainly part of the Schwartz's experience and even though I hate waiting, I love the fact that they haven't caved and moved locations - there's something special about that spot. Once you get inside, expect to be rushed to a table, where you're likely to sit with strangers if you're a twosome. But don't worry about making awkward conversation, it's understandable that no one could talk with that much meat in their mouth.

The servers are attentive but somewhat impatient. I feel as though part of that comes from the fact that if you're from out of town you should really just be ordering the smoked meat and if you're a local you already know to get the smoked meat. The other part? They're French. Ehyo!

If you are from out of town do yourself a favour and spend the $50 on a brisket to go. It won't be the same, but it'll still be the best thing you eat that week. Wish I had some in my freezer right now. I guess it's time to go back."}
{"text":"Glad to be in the company of Celine Dion and Hank Aaron! Sandwiches were amazing. Got the smoked sandwich medium, by recommendation and was excited to receive my sandwich exploding already. French fries were quite tasty. Have to try the sandwich at Main's for comparison, but will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Schwatz isn't bad but it's not worth the hype. The smoked meat is good but it's not the best in the city. This place is pretty much just a tourist trap. There's a reason there aren't any regulars, just gullible tourists who want to eat at the good, but not great, restaurant they've heard of."}
{"text":"The smoked meat I had definitely tasted authentic but the overwhelming mustard that wasn't as tangy as I would have like it took over the taste of the sandwich. Overall the line and hype is not worth it."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich is awesome.  Very flavorful, smoky, simple, and just plain tasty.  It's served on rye with mustard.  I also had fries, which were so-so, and a can of black cherry soda, which was delicious.  Next time I'll get a pickle and/or cole slaw instead of the fries."}
{"text":"As a New Jersey native that frequents New York City delis, I have to say, Schwartz's rivals Katz's and 2nd Avenue Deli. I'm in Montreal with a friend for the weekend, and my father, a deli aficionado, begged me to visit this restaurant.

After reading the reviews, we expected our lunchtime wait to be much longer than it was. We reached the front of the line relatively quickly, and were seated at a table with two couples. Both of us opted to order the smoked meat sandwich (in case you're wondering - that's pastrami) and sour pickles. It was some of the best pastrami I've ever had. The flavor and texture of the meat were perfect, and it had just the right amount of fat. The rye was flavorful. The pickle was hands down one of the best pickles I've ever eaten. 

We both left full and happy, and I'll definitely return if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"The wait in line was worth it.  I waited in the take out line, which is faster.  Took the fatty smoked and it was pretty good.  When I got my sandwich it was not as hot as I thought it would be.  I went back later and bought some smoked meat home and it was even better."}
{"text":"They still make the best smoked meat in the world! Be ready to stand in line up to 40 mins to get a table and 30 mins for take out. It's sooo worth it!!!"}
{"text":"If you're through Montreal, you must make a stop here. The best smoked meat sandwiches for a great price! As mentioned, the lineup is usually quite long, but you can do the takeout line which is much quicker and find somewhere else to eat. Be careful when eating, however, as in your moments of enjoying the amazing sandwich, you may be dripping mustard all over the place."}
{"text":"I eat smoke meat first time at Schwartz's. I heard that it is very popular restaurant before I come here. It is very delicious food."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal on business and was told not to miss this place.  Well, I have to agree.  I ordered the smoked sandwich and a cherry coke and I was not disappointed.  Make sure you have cash, they don't accept credit or debit cards."}
{"text":"Holy moly.

We went on Friday afternoon around 3, as I heard it was really popular. Yep, even at 3:00 on a Friday afternoon! We finally got tired of waiting, so we popped in next door and ordered 2 sandwiches and 1 pickle from the take out counter and ate it on the street.

Tasty, messy & reasonably priced. I now understand the line."}
{"text":"In my quest for the best Jewish deli in the world, this is currently sitting at #1.  Don't get me wrong, other Jewish Deli's are great and I will gladly eat at any of the top tier ones (Katz's, Manny's, etc) any time, but the smoked meat here is above any other deli sandwich I've tried.  Really, there's nothing else about this place that I even care or think about, it is all smoked meat, all the time.  Worth the wait in line out front, in my case, worth the plane ticket to Montreal."}
{"text":"Before we came to Montreal we were told that Schwartz's is one of the most popular places is Montreal, a legendary deli that you must visit. We decided to go there for an early lunch. Just a small line and... We're in.
Very cool atmosphere and nice service. We ordered two smoked meat sandwiches, fries and sour pickle. Meat was a little dry but very tasty. Fries and pickle were good. Decent food in a nice neighborhood. I recommend this place definitely."}
{"text":"Classic. If you've never been, just go. Opt for the medium fat sandwich with fries and a cherry cola."}
{"text":"it's a must when you visit Montreal.. It's more like a tourist attraction."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich was as good as I expected (and I had high expectations). The place was too small for the crowd it attracted. We stood outside waiting for ten minutes and when we finally got inside we were placed on the same 6 person table as a family of four. The food came out pretty quickly and the service was friendly despite the strain of the big crowd."}
{"text":"Toujours aussi bon et toujours un excellent service. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Assurément les meilleurs smoke meat à Montréal ! Le reste du menu est aussi excellent !
Un incontournable Montréalais. René et Céline Dion font partie des propriétaires !"}
{"text":"Schwartz of Montreal is the real thing.  Smoked Meat is a quick and hearty lunch, and Schwartz delivers, dont come here expecting something other than a delightfull, artery clogging sandwich.  

The prices are reasonable, decor is 'authentic' and the service is fast.  

Scwartz is above all an experience, if you are in Montreal and looking for a place to indulge in the city's vast food history, skip the Poutine and go for this on St-Laurent instead."}
{"text":"I realize this place is super popular, but honestly, I just wasn't THAT impressed.

As recommended by Foodology.ca, we took ours to go when we visited this place one Saturday afternoon. We dropped by around 3PM, so it was surprising that the line up was still pretty long. We ordered the regular smoked meat and some soda drinks. The service for the take out counter was efficient and prompt. 

The sandwich was one big, meaty affair. Just looking at it, I was prepared to be blown away. The actual result wasn't as epic though. 

The meat was super tasty, and I can see why this place is famous. But the bread was a little dry and the meal was too salty for my taste buds. Even for a meat-loving dude, I thought that the sandwich had too much meat and not enough anything else. The sandwich's flavour was too one note.  Perhaps I just expected too much?

I'm not super impressed, but I would recommend this place for tourists just to see what the buzz is all about."}
{"text":"This is some awesome smoked meat. I read the reviews while I was standing on the long queue for seats in the restaurant side of the establishment. Some people said the meat was bland and tasteless, but after trying it myself I had to ask...where were they from and what do they usually eat?? 

The smoked meat was so tender and pretty flavorful, with just a bit of fat left on to make me swoon. I ate it plain without the bread or mustard and didn't feel it bland at all, maybe if you were comparing it to Southern American BBQ.

However, as part of my Schwartz combo, I also had a steak with my smoked meat. I asked for rare and it was no where near it.  It was so overcooked and completely bland. It's probably why they sprinkle even more of their signature rub mixture on it before they served it to me, this piece of meat needs all the help it can get in the flavor department. The combo also came with an hot dog sausage, not too memorable.

The sides were good though. The cole slaw was crisp and with just the right amount of vinegar, one of the best slaw I ever had. The large pickle was also just right. I devoured both.

Stick to the smoked meat, ask for cole slaw, pickles, and peppers. Try to pair off when waiting in line. The counter opens up much faster and it always has room for two or less."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing smoked meat sandwich!  I was skeptical of all of the hype, but it is well deserved! We had lunch there.  Both had the smoked meat sandwich, then shared frites and coleslaw.  It was all very good.  The beauty of the sandwich is that it is so simple (meat, simple fresh white bread and mustard).  That it is.  The meat is done so well, it doesn't need to hide behind anything.  I will be back... hopefully soon...!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! The line is very long but goes fairly quickly. Worth every min of waiting tho. The smoked meat sandwich was definitely one of the best. You will not be disappointed. Be sure to get the pickle. Adds to the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"We went in on a rainy day and were soaking wet. The waiters were very warm and nice. The smoked meat sandwich tasted really good with mustard. Cole slaw and pickles are good additions to the taste. Their lovely service deserves 10 stars though."}
{"text":"This place is out of this world. I dream of driving all the way up to Montreal just for another bite of this smoked meat. I thought this place would be more hype than substance, but it wasn't. Try to come here in the mid-afternoon, and avoid lunch unless you want to wait 40 minutes in line."}
{"text":"Ok so i live super close to Schwartz's on Saint-Laurent Boulevard.
I have nothing against this business per say..However in the summer when a local Montrealer as i am who lives next door to this restaurant wants to walk on the sidewalk that my taxes paid for i find myself always having to step off the sidewalk and having to walk on the street because this restaurant is very small and has loads of locals & tourists who arrive in big groups are blocking THE SIDEWALK!! Walking on Saint-Laurent boulevard is not a wise choice and in spring 2017 due to the crowd in front of your restaurant i was not able to walk on the sidewalk i had to step on the street and i came close to being hit by a city bus!!!!!

You have 1 employee,some bus boy or server who will step outside from time to time to call guests who are waiting in line blocking the sidewalk to their table but you have no control over the group of tourists blocking my right of way.

I suggest you fix this issue before someone gets hit by a bus.
This spring i will not be shy and if i see your clients blocking the sidewalk i will call the city and the cops .I already called you and spoke to the \"owner\" last year about this subject. This is your final warning.
Block the sidewalk in 2018,i dare you!"}
{"text":"In August 2015, I spent a few days in Montreal and, naturally, went to Schwartz's for their famous smoked meat sandwich. On a rainy day around noon, we parked a few blocks away and rushed through puddles of water to a large sign above a small doorway. Although there was no wait (and available seating), we decided to order a sandwich to-go, so as to enjoy it in the car while watching the downpour. 

While our experience within the restaurant was brief, the service was friendly and efficient; our order was ready within minutes. Back in the car, we unwrapped the smoked meat delight and began our critique. Our sandwich was made without modifications - It was hearty, tender, and very good, although it was a bit too fatty for my taste. Traditionally, the sandwich is served on plain sliced bread, which is fine but it does not add to the overall sandwich. This is definitely a meal where the star is the meat, without competition from condiments, bread, or other features. For New Yorkers, Schwartz's smoked meat sandwich is relatively comparable to Katz. 

While I would rate the sandwich itself a 4/5, my overall rating was around a 4.5/5 because of the significance in local cuisine and culture. This smoked meat sandwich was my third favourite food item from Montreal (1. La Banquise, 2. Sesame bagels from Fairmount, 3. Schwartz). I would definitely advise Montreal visitors to stop by Schwartz for a taste of popular Montreal cuisine."}
{"text":"Whenever you're in Montreal do yourself a favor and experience Schwartz's 

Small place but great smoked meat

For us New Yorkers, Pastrami"}
{"text":"If you plan to visit Montreal, this is a must stop spot.  Get your grub on for cheap and eat the best smoked sandwich ever. You have the choice of lean, regular or fatty meat....so of course I order fatty and it was so worth it.  You also have to order the pickle, coleslaw and black cherry soda...it wouldn't be the same without them.  Their coleslaw is the best I've ever had....no mayo, just vinegar and their special ingredients.  Mmmmm...."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat in the city. Wait in line during the day or evenings, or go there after a night of drinking when there is less of a wait. Fantastically delicious, fatty and flavourful"}
{"text":"The Smoke Meat is too dry to my taste. Everything is extra. Seating is not comfortable. I had better Smoked Meat Sandwich elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is great!

Arrived on a rainy Wednesday evening in late October and had no trouble finding a table. Had the classic smoked meat sandwich (medium, the only way to go), sour pickle, fries, coleslaw, and a black cherry cola (which I did not think I would enjoy, but the waiter highly recommended it and I'm glad I went for it because it tasted pretty great).

The meat was melt in your mouth fabulous! You need to eat the sandwich quickly though, as when it gets even slightly cold all that fat doesn't taste that great in your mouth anymore. The fries, coleslaw, and pickle were all great as well.

This place definitely lived up to all of the anticipation and hype, absolutely worth the wait in line, if you happen to find yourself in one."}
{"text":"I liked it modestly.  But i must say, comparing this to Katz's NYC-it doesn't come close.  The quality and the rich full bodied flavor of Pastrami that is hand cut, vs. the much less spiced and seemingly lower quality meat-smoked meat.  Handsdown-Katz is better."}
{"text":"This place is cramped and a little grimy looking but the smoked meat is the best in Montreal."}
{"text":"The line was wicked long for Sunday afternoon. We went next door into the take out section but instead found some seats inside with no wait.  I ordered the smoked meat sandwich which was amazing.  The sandwich cost 5.50.  I do have to keep adding mustard though. But it was still delicious.  The sandwich looks small but sure was filling.  They were out of smoked chicken which my non-beef eater friend needed, so he was stuck with the turkey sandwich, which was nothing more than a cold cut."}
{"text":"The famous Schwartz's! Recommended by a lot of my friends and locals. Schwartz's was busy when we arrived, the line was out the door! Luckily, next door they have a Take-out shop and smaller line. Once you order you can sit at the back. I ordered a standard Smoke meat sandwich and fries. My first bite was glorious! The juicy and flavourful sandwich has the best meat to bread ratio. Added a bit more of mustard and it was beyond perfect. The Sandwich did not disappoint and I highly recommend Schwartz's smoke meat to anyone. It is hard describe how glorious the sandwich was (It was that good!!!) hence, YOU ALL MUST TRY IT. Fries were crispy and hot, good combo!

I have also went to Katz's in New York and I enjoy Schwartz's much more especially when you can get poutine on the side =p

If you are in a rush I recommend go next door and get takeout. Especially if you have limited time in Montreal and have more places to eat!"}
{"text":"We walked from our hotel on Peel and Sherbrooke and got there just before 5 pm on 3/24/11.  There was no line out the door which is a good sign we wouldn't need to wait outside in the cold.  Inside is rather small but it wasn't too busy and we got seats right away.  

At first we didn't know what to do as far as ordering so it felt like we were being ignored.  But after a few minutes we were told by a worker on his way out that the next shift was coming in and that someone would come to take our order.  George was our guy.  He's one of the older ones working but he was friendly and erased any misgivings we had while waiting.

I personally got the smoked meat sandwich.  Fatty.  Or if that's not you then they also offer lean or medium.  For the price and taste I feel you get more value here compared with a sandwich from a NYC establishment like Carnegie Deli.  I also got a pickle on the side; that was OK.  You must get their fries though.  The taste of the potatoes are...Je ne sais quoi...awesome to say the least."}
{"text":"A must stop for me when I am in Montreal. The pastrami is delicious, and the portions are huge. make sure you come hungry, and you will leave content."}
{"text":"You just have to try smoked meat while in Montreal! Go during down times to avoid lines. Go with the medium or fatty for the best experience. Lean is just too lean and dry. And always order a pickle for your side."}
{"text":"Smoked meat.  Smoked MEAT. SMOKED MEAT.

Yes.


Enough said, ya heard?  It's flipping delicious."}
{"text":"Schwartz deli is an outstanding Montreal classic for smoked meat. Ok it is essentially corned beef, but it is SO amazing. The line is fast, the guys are funny and the seating is limited. Get in there! Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"When it comes to smoked meat, Schwartz's is the best Smoked meat that I have ever tried. The Meat is tender with the right amount  of fat and it just melts right in your mouth. You will never look at Montreal Smoked meat  the same again. This is the place to go. The only downside is that the place could be cleaner, because the tables were dirty, but other than that, it shouldn't drive you away because the sandwiches here are excellent, and this is the best smoked meat that you can possibly eat."}
{"text":"Expect a line up at this place, the only question is how long do you have to wait? We got there around 7pm on a Saturday, so waited about 30mins for a table of 7, which wasn't as bad as I thought. If you are in a rush, you also have the option to get take out next door. For the dining side, the seating area is a little crammed (didn't mind it at all) and the walls are filled with all the magazines articles written about Schwartz's or photos of celebrities who at there. The smoked meat which is what they specialize, is hands down the best meat I've ever had and yes, you can choose the amount of fat you want on it too. The pricing is cheaper than Reuben's smoked meat sandwhich. You have to go to this place if you are visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"So, so good.  Simple, straight forward, no frills.... just good.  Get yourself a sandwich, maybe some fries, maybe some slaw or a pickle, and you are good to go.

When ordering, you will be asked how lean you want your meat.  I'd recommend asking for a little fat.  That's where the flavor really is.... and hey, you are going on vacation most likely if you are reading this.

The service I received was very good.  This is not a place to have a long conversation over lazily picking at your food.  You get in (there will be a line going out the door), you get seated (more than one party will be seated at your table), you eat, you pay, you get out.

So good I went twice while I was in Montreal!

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Trap de touristes! Je croyais que le smoke meat allait être juteux mais c'était tellement sec... dire que j'ai attendu pour ça!"}
{"text":"I confess, I came here because I read Schwartz's is a must-do experience while in Montréal and I had a great experience. There is always a HUGE line so if you plan to eat at the deli and not to take-out, be prepared for a long wait. 
Once inside, the service is quite fast and everything is very well organized. 
The restaurant is always so packed that once you are seated, you will have very little room to move.
We ordered two smoked meat sandwiches ($9.60 each) and they were delicious, the meat was very tender and the portion was just right."}
{"text":"Absolutely life changing, best meats we found in Montreal. Plan to wait in line. We ended up being the last served for the day, very lucky of us."}
{"text":"Better than New York's pastrami hands down. This is the smoked meat that makes me dream of coming back to Montreal. The line-up is crap and full of tourists. But it's faster in the new(ish) take out line where you can buy some smoked meat to go.

The sandwichs come in \"medium\" and \"fatty\" - I went for the fatty which soaked through the paper bag and make it clear. It was worth it because the sandwich melts in your mouth and is a bit pricey at $7 because the sandwiches have gotten smaller over the years."}
{"text":"The beef and fries are tasty. The line was long, but if you don't want to wait for a table there is a togo that's faster. If you like mustard, get some extra cause it doesn't come with much. Definitely a must if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"It was just ok, overrated tourist attraction, go to Marche Jean-Talon instead and look for Willams, their sandwich is much better!"}
{"text":"Pour un bon smoke meat, une référence. Je préfère quand même la version maigre ou médium à la version grasse. Service toujours très sympathique."}
{"text":"Busy and on the more expensive side but always has the best smoked meat. Great to go to after a night out"}
{"text":"Whenever my family comes to Montreal we go to the other smoked meat restaurant on Metcalfe. This time we decided to go to Schwartz''s.  No lines and plenty of tables.  
We sat down and ordered a large platter of old fashioned smoked meat  and a large French fries. 
Much to my dismay the MEAT came cold and a bit tough.  The fries were warm and greasy as they are supposed to be.   
When we received the bill I was very surprised to see a charge for SHARING.  The  platter came with no less than 10 slices of bread.  No one person can eat all the bread and close to a pound of meat. 
The waiter said to us that management gets pissed off if they don't charge $1.75 for sharing. 
Had we been told when we first ordered our food at least we would have had a choice and maybe ordered two small platters.  
I feel we should have been told and not just find it on the bill. They just lost a patron for the future."}
{"text":"yeah toujours le meilleur en ville!"}
{"text":"All the smoked meats are made onsite. We waited in the rain to get a table in the middle of the week.  It is always packed.  The meat is delish but the other offerings I felt were a little so-so. Try a pickle with your meat.  We had a fatty and a lean serving at our table.  I would recommend the lean as fatty really is fatty.  The brisket is yummy.  You will get a LOT of food for the money.  It's legendary so worth the wait and visit.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Avec toutes les belles promesses que tient ce restaurant, la déception a été énorme!! Faire la queue, payer aussi cher pour si peu, être sous pression parce que les gens attendent, et tout ça  pour une viande certes bonne mais pas de quoi en faire une montagne! 
Déçu donc, même si le serveur au moins était agréable."}
{"text":"I'm not sure which I liked better: the sandwich or the garlic pickle. Schwartz's is truly the definition of deliciousness on a plate."}
{"text":"I sought out this place on my last trip to Montreal. The waiter told us that Schwartz's was voted the best deli in North America. Having grown up in New York, I definitely didn't believe it... Until I tried their smoked meat sandwich. It was so simple yet so delicious. If you're visiting Montreal or if you're lucky enough to live there, eat at Schwartz's. Because of its small size there's often a line, but I assure you that their smoked meat sandwich is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Overrated in so many ways, this can hardly be called a smoked meat restaurant. Disappointed."}
{"text":"If you are in Montreal and you love meat and you have never been here, you have to go! This place is soo good. Smoked meat sandwich or medium plate mmmmm. Without a doubt best smoked meat in montreal. Sandwich is loaded with half a pound and it's so filling for only 7$. Can't beat that. Especially the taste. They only take cash tho!"}
{"text":"Was here within half hour of getting off the plane. As always, a really grimy atmosphere and waiters that could care less, but it's all as expected, and I love it. 
I heard the guy take two different orders where the customers order something and he said no you don't want that, you'll have a medium with fries and a pickle. 
Still amazing smoked meat sandwiches! I got a medium and a fatty one on both visits during this trip. Soooooo good!! Got an extra to take home with me after devouring the first one."}
{"text":"Allez chercher 2lbs de smoked meat plus un pain pour 40$ tout un repas j'aime ça avec du moutarde de Dijon je pense que g manger pour 1 lbs toute seul oup il reste pas trop pour mes copains;("}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews from the fellow Yelpers, I went to try the food at this restaurant one afternoon . It was packed and had to be in the line for 15 minutes. 
But that's ok , you get to chat with the fellow strangers in the line.
The owners were getting us in the restaurant, as fast they could, assuring everyone that they would be seated soon.
Once you enter the restaurant, you feel like you are back in the 80's. It's old school. You order the food, it will be served to you soon. Try the smoked meat sandwich with the cherry cola. You will love it . 
Fellow Yelper's are moaning to stand in line for 15 minutes . Trust me it's all worth it for the food . Remember the good things in life always takes time . I had met a family from Ontario, who had come back to eat at this restaurant after 20 years. They had waited in line patiently and really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"We go here for smoked meat often.... okay, more take-away than actually sitting in the restaurant. Great smoked meat sandwiches."}
{"text":"Holy f@$k do they have a wicked smoked meat sandwich! Best I've ever had!

Coleslaw side went perfect with all that meat. Top it off with a cherry cola and you're good to go. Service is great and friendly with entertaining banter! Character to the max. All sorts of people stuffed together in this little dinner looking place simultaneously chowing down on smoked meat. 

If you could eat only one meal in Montreal this is the place! Pretty sure this is Montreal smoked meat heaven!"}
{"text":"I'm a big sandwich fan and I can't tell you how much I love the smoked meat sandwich here.  If you're in Montreal you HAVE to stop into here and get a smoked meat sandwich.  Remember to get it medium as the lean one always seems dry.  The fries are nothing special (don't get me wrong they're not terrible!) but the pickles are pretty damn good and remember your cherry cola!

Every time I've been there has been a wait to dine in but there is take out.  This is one of my favourite sandwich places in the world."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their smoked meat sandwich here. 

Portion wise, it isn't the biggest but I'm not complaining since it won't give me the biggest food coma compared to Kat'z colossal sized Reuben.

Nice and friendly staff but make sure you know what you want!

Takes US cash but theres a 10% extra charge for that!"}
{"text":"I'm from New York and I know smoked meat.  That was one of the best corned beef sandwiches I ever had, superbly moist."}
{"text":"Okay let's get one thing straight...Schwartz's is Schwartz's. Always has, always will.  It's an institution. It's the best smoked meat in all of Canada...hands down.
You may have to wait a long time in line to get in...that's the way it is. You may have to sit next to complete strangers and pass the salt and ketchup...that's the way it is. You may not have the luxury of lingering over your coffee (more rightfully your Cott's cherry soda)... that's the way it is. You may not have many options if you are a vegetarian or if you are a fussy eater that wants to make substitutions...that's the way it is.

All you need to know about Schwartz's is that when you finally get a seat all you need to do is smile and say a simple \"Hello/Bonjour\" to the people seated around you, order the following \" A medium sandwich(we aren't talking size here by the way...medium is the fat content. Lean just doesn't have enough taste) with fries and a pickle and a cherry soda (you can Pepsi and Coke everywhere...here you drink Cott's)\", eat, pay, leave.  You'll do so having filled yourself with a great fortifying meal and having shared an experience that movie stars, politicians and rocks star past and present have done before you.

In the spring of 2011 look for Schwartz's: The Musical from your friends at Bowser & Blue.  Dinner and show anybody?"}
{"text":"So you don't like smoked meats?  Me either.  If you're reading this, you probably like them but maybe a friend, lover or spouse isn't crazy about the idea...this is what you do.  Order the chicken sandwich and fries.  I know, sinful to some, but I love it.  It is my favorite chicken sandwich EVER.  It's seasoned and perfectly plopped between that rye bread.  Worth the wait in line even.  As much as I love eavesdropping though, because secretly, I'd love to be a spy, the seating here isn't my favorite.  I do prefer my own table but you'll be sharing a table if you're here during peak hours.  I'll still go but that's my only reason for four stars.  I do like to eat without literally touching a stranger.  I also don't speak French so the eavesdropping is not nearly as juicy if you are next to the FRENCH Canadians.  Oh well, better luck next time!  It's a must visit spot if you're in Montreal and not opposed to lunch meat."}
{"text":"Cash only. 

We had a rake out sandwich and frites from the take out side. Service was fast and extremely friendly. The sandwich was massive and exactly as advertised. The bread is the perfect complement. 

No wait, which was unexpected."}
{"text":"You have not lived until you've had a smoked meat sandwich at Schwartz's, I promise you that. Get it with the medium amount of fatty goodness (versus fatty or lean - yes, those are options). While you wait, snack on some delicious pickles. Have a black cherry soda to wash it all down. Oh, and definitely sit at the counter if you can. 

No worries, you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Oh Canada ! My Uber driver told me this was a MUST while I was in Montreal so... after a few beers at a local brewery we went.

There are two sides: Take Out & Sit Down. The take out was packed with a line so we opened door #2 and to our surprise... two bar seats greeted us! The smell of the smoked meat makes you salivate. We quickly ordered a sandwich with fries and a pickle. 

My buddy and I shared zero communication during our meal, that in itself says it all. The meat was so tender and flavorful it was unique.

This place was so on point, we came back two days later before heading stateside. #musteat"}
{"text":"This place is almost the epitome of touristy. although i was a tourist too, there were some locals eating there it seemed. am i contradicting myself? i think im confused. i would say the food was ok. its quite a lot of meat, not many carbs and quite expensive. you will need to order at minimum a pickle or cole slaw or fries or bread to balance the meat.
wouldnt really recommend to my friends bc it isnt my thing"}
{"text":"This is a traditional spot in the Jewish neighbourhood in Montreal.  My sister in law, who grew up in Montreal, recommended it...and really it is one of those places you should go...It was good corned beef ( called smoked meat in Canada obviously).  The restaurant is very basic really which is part of the Eth, so to speak.  The service was quick and friendly.  But it is a one note experience..."}
{"text":"If you are visiting Montreal or live in Montreal, this is a MUST (and I really mean a MUST!) place to come to eat (even if you aren't hungry, you just gotta try it! And if you are not a meat eater... then this place will make you want to convert). I heard a lot about this place from one of my cousins and he even asked my brother and I to bring him back some of the famous smoked meat since we decided to make a trip to Montreal. 
I am so glad we stopped in here because the food was amazing! When we first walked over here, there was a line that was out the door, but it went by rather quickly (and this was in the afternoon around 2 pm on a week day). The smoked sandwich (I prefer the lean over the regular and fatty versions) was just so meaty and the portion was incredibly generous and very flavorful (taste like pastrami to me, but better). The turkey sandwich here is pretty good too. And I love that pickle spear that comes w/ the meal. Oh and by the way, if you come early at 8 am, you won't be able to order hot meat until at least 10 am.
We purchased about 2 pounds of meat for my cousin to bring back to Toronto, which was sealed in a vac packed bag and also decided to buy 2 pounds of meat to take back home with us to California too. We were able to get through customs (in a carry on luggage) no problem. We had a receipt to show that we purchased it from Schwartz' in case, but the guy at customs never asked and just let us through (but secretly he was probably trying to think up of a way to cease it from us so that he could eat it during his lunch break)."}
{"text":"Absolutely worth the hype and the wait. Tender smoked meat, friendly service, everything about the experience was wonderful. Went 2 days in a row! Best Jewish deli I've been to."}
{"text":"Schwartz's Deli is a Montreal institution. There is a reason why there's always a line up outside the door. It also means those guys are bustin' their ass hand-slicing properly seasoned smoked meat (usually top notch brisket). 

As much as I love Schwartz and it will always exemplify the \"taste\" of Montreal to me (along with Fairmont's bagels), I have to give it 4 stars because I'm also pretty disappointed that they haven't expanded or made the restaurant moree... let's say, 'user-friendly'. This isn't a knock on the business, because I can defend them if they said they just want to keep the same traditional feel to the place. I just won't be able to enjoy eating inside for a couple of years because my son is 7months old. It would be a disaster if we brought him in to eat because his stroller and diaper bag would take up the entire table.

I always believed in the notion that if you build it, they will come. And just like any business, in order to ensure its continued success, it must constantly improve. The food needs ZERO improvement. That's the one thing that I hope stays traditional forever. I just ask that you expand.. one day hopefully to Toronto; there is a hungry, food-centric, market that would gobble up these sandwiches. For now, I will just have to enjoy the take-out ones."}
{"text":"A masterpiece of a food experience. Everything you've read and heard it true. The place is of legend. Make this your first visit in Montreal."}
{"text":"Schwartz's smoked meat are to die for. The flavors are wonderful and the texture is awesome. The 'sandwiches' are really just a huge stack of these lovely smoked meat in between two little slices of rye bread. Any normal sandwich stores would easily make 4-5 sandwiches out of the amount of meat you get here. Really not bad for such an inexpensive sandwich.

Most of the time there is a fairly long line out the door. If you just want to order take out there is separate entrance. The wait is usually a lot shorter."}
{"text":"Smoked meat is good if you ask for Medium-fat at the very least. Hate the staff though..."}
{"text":"Delicious! A little overpriced (you have to pay quite a bit extra for a pickle, or some fries lolol) but that's what you get with tourist traps!  Worth it but I wouldn't hit it up unless it was a craving or showing someone new around Montreal."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here based on a local's recommendation that this was the best smoked meat place in Montreal. Of course we had to try it, and we had envisions of some kind of unique, delicacy only found in Montreal. 

We arrived a bit before noon and a line was already forming. However, it went quickly and we were seated at a table with other patrons (super small place and utilitarian in style). We quickly realized this  was a Jewish deli serving up what is akin to a corned beef sandwich on rye, which was decent, but I wasn't as enamored as the locals. Maybe having had great corned beef sandwiches in New York and Miami have spoiled me. The service was great, though, they don't rush you, and they let you choose the level of fat/leanness you want in the meat."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something about this place. Definitely the best smoked meat sandwich I have had. The rye bread goes so well with the smoked saltiness of the brisket. It was very mouth watering and I had a very salty pickle to go with it. My god, the only thing I wish for is for other smoked meat to come close to the taste because they don't. I tried another in Montreal and another in Quebec city and you know it is the best when you think food you had in the past is better than the food you are eating in front of you. I wish every smoked meat sandwich was a Schwartz's smoked meat sandwich. Plus the guys that work there are so old school cool. 5 stars for the delicious old school cool smoked meat sandwich. I would advise to grab one whenever you pass by."}
{"text":"This place is pretty delicious. We ate smoked meat sandwiches with some pickles and coleslaw, plus two black cherry sodas (which they recommended). I did think it was a little expensive, but this is an iconic, touristy place, so I expected it. We're from NYC so the servers made a lot of comparisons to Katz's Deli.

We went before noon on a snowy day so the place was pretty empty when we arrived. (I hear it can get crowded with lines) The staff were beyond friendly and went out of their way to make conversation and to explain their menu."}
{"text":"Another Montreal must! Schwartz's is the Katz's deli (in NYC) of Montreal. It's a simple deli that's been around for ages and still only makes the classics. They also sell a variety of seasonings so you can make their classics too. Also important to note, it's a Jewish deli but not a kosher deli. 

There are two sides - sit down and takeaway. If you're in a rush or it's a nice day, definitely jump on the takeaway line and grab the smoked meat (brisket) sandwich to go. It's a few blocks from Mont Royal Park so you can bring your food there, or find a seat at ledges across the street. I haven't dined in the real restaurant since I have a strong aversion to waiting on lines, but it's the same classics so I'd recommend the take away. 

The sandwich is simple with just the warm smoked brisket, spiced to perfect, and a touch of mustard. I'm not a huge mustard fan and thought the touch of it was perfect. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I had heard about Schwartz's on the travel channel. So when I knew I was going to Montreal I had to come here. When I think of smoked meats I get a little high and giddy with excitement. Well the line was out the door when I arrived, so I'm thinking I hit the jackpot. Finally inside and seated at the counter, pastrami's everywhere.I order the sandwich and get ready to sink my teeth into deliciousness. No such luck, below average pastrami and rye bread. The coleslaw was runny, and the meat really fatty. Guess I'm used to good smoked deli meats being from Los Angeles and eating at deli's most of my life. 

Immediately I'm disappointed but what the hell I'm in Montreal and it's beautiful outside. While I'm walking I see several other smoked meat restaurants and they all are empty. I go inside one called Slovenka and it smells heavenly. Don't get the draw of Schwartz's other then it was original and old."}
{"text":"Like many have suggested, this is a must-go if it is your first time in Montreal.  The smoked meat is fantastic yes, however I think it is pretty over-priced for a sandwich of this size.  Higher prices likely due to volume of tourists going through.

It will run you $20 for a sandwich, fries, and a pop."}
{"text":"Line out the door for good reason. Good thing there's a takeout section. Their smoked meat sandwich aka brisket was incredible."}
{"text":"Smoked, well-marbleized, peppery, and juicy beef - count me in! We got the sandwiches to go (took 5 mins) since the dine-in line was very long for a Monday lunch. We got the standard smoked meat sandwich. It is a bit different compared to the NY pastrami sandwiches you would find in places like Katz Deli primarily because the beef is much more peppery (in a good way). Definitely worth checking out if you need some fatty smoked meat in your life!"}
{"text":"Best place in town and the service was very friendly and awesome. It was a great experience."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I dropped $70 there and left unimpressed. All you get is pound of meat on 2 slices of bread wit mustard. The smoked meat wasn't as good as Dunns in Ottawa. The turkey , salami and chicken sandwiches were terrible. The fries were soggy and no salt. The potato salad and macaroni salad was bland and kinda gross. This place is over priced and the staff were chauvinists yelling at girls passing by as I was trying to order from them. Don't waste your time or money. Not impressed."}
{"text":"There's always a line at this place and it came highly recommended by locals, so I had to give it a try. Ordered the signature smoked meat sandwich and was underwhelmed. It's okay, but nothing screams at you making you want to return."}
{"text":"This deli is so small. My family and I sat on a table of six and we still had three more spaces. The waiter merged us with these two guys and my parents are very icky about their personal bubble. But, they were very social and nice with us and it felt like we were all typical friends just eating at a resto. After that, it was very noticeable that my parents had a very good time and they never got bothered by tight spaces with strangers anymore. Memorable experience."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place is an institution in Montreal. Their smoked meat is extremely hard to beat. I'm on the fence whether I prefer Smoke Meat Pete's or Schwartz but both deserve 5 stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"This meat can't be better. Definitely I ate more than I should have. Made sandwiches at home since I like the freedom of applying my own condiments. Looked like a festive crowd and will defiinitely partake in the festivities on location next time. 

Cash only."}
{"text":"Been there for years. Quality, quality, quality at a very reasonable price. Careful - very easy to over-indulge. Be willing to take some home with you."}
{"text":"This place is nostalgic and a must visit for visitors!!  There is always a line for takeout, but line moves fast so expect 15-20 mins wait on a busy day.  The meat is juicy and succulent.  I would ask for medium fatty to fatty for those melt-in-your-mouth bites.  The bread can get a bit dry, so make sure to eat with those fatty pieces of juicy meat!!"}
{"text":"Holy cow.  This place is awesome.  Authentic NY jewish food and the same charm also.  Smoked meat is so good!  Fresh rye, pickles, coleslaw...doesn't get any better. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this little piece of smoked meat heaven!  I always stop by when I'm in Montreal. I stopped in on a Friday evening a couple of weeks ago around 5:30/6 and did not have to wait for a seat.  The service was fast and super friendly.  Some of the service staff who were on break were munching on yummy looking tarts.  When we asked what they were, one of the staff gave us a tart and said we could have it for dessert!  

I also stopped in to the retail store a few days after and before heading home to pick up some smoked meat for myself and friends.  The vacuum packages have instructions on how to heat and serve.  I can assure you that the meat was just as delicious (if not only a tad dry after reheating but better than any smoked meat I can find locally!) I will of course return the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"One day to spend in Montreal!? What to do? Schwartz! I love how fast the service is and how it's always crowded! I however do think that it's slightly overpriced, but I guess for something as famous as smoked meat sandwiches in Montreal it has to run around that price range. I haven't had any other smoke meat sandwiches to compared, so I'm rated it 4 because it's great in it's own category for now. The meat was very juicy, and I love mustard so that was a bonus to know that they only put mustard on the sandwiches. It kind of has a slight smell of roast beef, and a texture close to a mixture of pastrami and roast beef.  it's been about two weeks since I've been back in California and as I'm writing this review my mouth is watering lol. As for everything else. I think the sandwiches are great tasting, the place is a little crowded, but that doesn't throw off the purpose of the deli, it's got great food, who cares about the so called crappy service. I didn't get any crappy service, they were busy and I completely understand. The food was outstanding. I'll be back to schwartz when I'm in Montreal again."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwiches and the smoked meat poutines are tremendous.  So is the cherry soda.  Great atmosphere.  I prefer their meat to Lester's deli but that's a personal preference."}
{"text":"The granddaddy of the makers of the tastiest cholesterol time bomb. 

My only gripe is that it gets touristy. If you want a real local Montreal deli, go to Lesters or Snowden."}
{"text":"Can't miss out trying Schwartz in Montreal when we arrived for a short weekend visit. The Schwartz meat sandwich was pretty good but not as great as what I had expected. Prior to trying, there was a lot of hype about it. 

The sandwich was packed with slices of succulent smoked meat with thin slices of bread. A little too much meat but I guess that's also what makes the sandwich so great for others."}
{"text":"Great sandwich. Order medium fat. Gotta have a pickle, fries and black cherry cola to complete the experience. We waited 5 minutes in line and luckily got a personal table in the back. Quick and friendly service. Lives up to the hype. Worth the price and the walk."}
{"text":"Over hyped.

Staff was friendly and the store was super busy at lunch time.

The one thing that really got to me is how salty it was. 

It was okay for taste but not worth for waiting the line.

They are not that clean atmosphere and small table is little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Really a famous restaurant. People are waiting in a long line, so I just had a takeout. It took me 20 minutes still. The sandwiches are really full of smoked meat. I strongly recommend fat meat as lean and middle fat would taste a little bit dry."}
{"text":"This place is an institution, a classic, and if you've never been i.e. visiting, it's a must go.
Plus, it's pretty easy to get to. Read the other reviews for opinions and photos :
And do me a favour, eat at the counter, and have a black cherry soda. CLASSIC.
In recent-ish news, they have an express/take out location next door.
Lastly, if the line is llooooooong as usual, like on the weekend, Prato on the other side of Shwartz'is great for oven cooked thin-crust pizza.

Sure, maybe it has lost some of it's lustre, but, sometimes you gotta check-in have a sandwich, just cuz.

Tip: Pick up their house branded chicken seasoning there. 
It's prettay, prettay, prettay good. I always buy a few and have extra as gifts. 

Bonus since I'm in a good mood: with a week or so notice, they can smoke a duck for you - I saw them in the windows during the holidays."}
{"text":"The service was just okay, not super nice, but not super rude either (as some have experienced).  However, we paid $17 for just ONE sandwich, a coleslaw, a pickle and a black cherry coke.  That's a pretty hefty price tag for bread that you can barely hold because it's so small and insignificant.

The medium fat smoked meat was good, but maybe I was expecting planets to shift based on all the reviews I've read.  A good sandwich that I might eat on occasion if it was in my neighbourhood, but not something I would drive 6 hours to try (which I partially did).

The fat was probably the best tasting part...and the only reason I ate it (because I usually avoid it at all costs), is because removing it would have de-flavoured the sandwich.  

So, if you're a tourist like me, I guess you have to go because all your Facebook friends told you to go...but if you don't care much about peer pressure, then you might save your stomach for something tastier...like foie gras poutine?"}
{"text":"This is a classic Montreal establishment and everyone should try the famous smoked meat once. However, be careful you don't overhype it. It's literally a bunch of smoked meat on some fairly dry plain bread with mustard. That's it. That's all you get. Unless you're weirdly obsessed with smoked meat, don't plan on this becoming a regular lunch spot. And I wouldn't say standing in the huge line that frequently snakes down the block is worth it. Wait for a day and time when there's no line. Make the most out of your Schwartz's experience. And be prepared to be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Yum!

Yes, the smoked meat sandwich is worth all of the hype and yes, you should get a pickle.

I'm not keen on queuing so I grabbed my sandwich and pickle to go and ate it at Mont Royal park instead. The meat was super tender and flavorful and it's true that just a swipe of mustard is all that the sandwich needs. The bread was fluffy and soft but somehow withstood the hearty meat. The pickle was pretty standard (typical Kosher pickle) but I loved it even more because it helped cut through the unctuousness of the meat.

Honestly, this is better than Katz's."}
{"text":"Not bad. We had a large party so we got take out. 
The dudes helping us at the counter weren't very friendly. Kind of a cold shoulder feel. It was our first time, like probably many others, but didn't offer any expertise.

I got the smoked meat sandwich and nothing else as some of my other buddies got frites and cole slaw. 

I stood outside and ate my sandwich. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't Langers or Katz pastrami. It is cheaper at like 7 dollars and they don't skimp on the meat. I just wasn't amazed. If you want it to taste better though... add cole slaw into the sandwich. It adds a lot of depth. The acidity and crunchy texture of the coleslaw complements the softness of the bread and saltiness of the smoked meat. I actually enjoyed my sandwich a lot more after the addition of cole slaw."}
{"text":"One of the best smoked-meat in town if not the best.
I'd rather eat across the street at the Main... open 24 hours... 
Go with the Rubbens you won't be disappointed! :)"}
{"text":"Didn't expect to find a Kosher Deli in a hipster neighborhood of Montreal. It looked Proper (um...Kosher), and it was ger-jammed with noshers. It's kind of community seating, and you'd think you were on the Lower East side of NYC, save for the French being spoken.
I was hit with a stern disappointment as we were seated. They had 86'd the Half-Sour Pickled for the night. Ran Out!. DAMN! The remaining Dills were of fine quality.
The big macher here is something called \"Smoked Meat\", which is basically what we know as \"Corned Beef\" here in the states. A little coarser in texture, but very tasty.
Schwartz's is very famous for their French Fries (Frites) which look like fresh cut spuds-they have that brown on brown slightly soggy character. Not typical frites as you would get in a bistro, but closer to the fries you get in a lot of Chicago HotDog stands. For some, these are quintessential eating, alas not for me. I'm not a big French Fry fan, soggy or not.
In the long run, it was a good Deli, not a great deli. The Carnegie, this isn't. If this place was in New york, it would be run-of-the mill. For Montreal, it was fine."}
{"text":"A Montreal tradition since 1928. Big waiting lines but not too long of a waiting time to get seated. Totally worth the wait their traditional smoked meat sandwich is out of this world! If you visit Montreal don't miss Schwartz's!"}
{"text":"Awesome smoked beef, Great coleslaw & pickles
Love the atmosphere, the hussle & bussle.
Will definitely eat here again when in Montreal.
Nothing bad to say, a GREAT experience, you can see why they are such an institution!!"}
{"text":"A lot has been written about this joint, so I'll keep it short: Schwartz's is the Everest of smoked meat deli.  You can talk about Katz's, Second Avenue Deli (rest in peace), Wolf's, or any other hallowed ground in the deli trade, but Schwartz's does what it does better than anybody."}
{"text":"Thus place is deservedly famous. The smoked meat is great and even the pickles are spectacular. Unlike in the States, the sandwiches aren't pointlessly gargantuan (and priced accordingly). Order yours \"medium,\" the way they recommend it. You'll be very happy, and you won't need to spend the rest of the day sleeping it off, as is sometimes the case in US delis. The cherry soda is good too, and the tab is reasonable. All in all a must in Montreal."}
{"text":"Everything about this spot is five stars- the customers, the workers, the atmosphere, and, of course, THE FOOD! I'll even overlook the bits of smoked meat all over the floor, because I feel just as bad as the person who accidentally dropped it. What a meaty waste. 

Lean smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle, cherry soda. The ultimate foodie delight."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing sandwiches I have ever had in my life. I wasn't expecting much but was blown away after just one bite. I never read about what to order or anything about the place except that people say it's a must-try in Montreal. Anyhow, I ordered the medium fat smoked meat sandwich which, I found out later on, was their signature dish. I went back two days later and ordered it again, This time, with a black cherry cola they recommend and it was sooooo good. Truly worth the visit. The second time I went, I was there at 3:30pm and there was no line up, there were many empty tables. It was also raining that day."}
{"text":"I finally decided to wait in line at Schwartz's to try a smoked meat sandwich. Total wait time, outside and at the table, was about 40 minutes. I came away disappointed. Sandwich was good but nothing special, although reasonably priced. Limited other meal options. Wait staff was friendly.

If you go, be prepared to wait. And bring cash as they don't take credit cards. And I mean, Canadian $. They'll exchange USD to CAD at a 1.10 rate but the official rate now is USD to CAD at 1.30.

A better recommendation. Skip the line and eat at the Main Deli across the street from Schwartz's."}
{"text":"Quick service and no frills, but the sandwich is where it's at. I wouldn't say better than old Katz's in NY but equal and different. Worth a visit for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with people that haven't been. It is always a long line up. The food is ok, medium fat is your best bet so it is not too dry. If you haven't tried it, I would put it on the list of places to eat in Montreal. Would i go out of my way just to eat here no. There is other smoke meat places around that is just as good."}
{"text":"Incredibly busy, family owned business with a fantastic atmosphere. This place has been opened since 1928 and it looks like it hasn't changed much since. FYI - Cash only! 

We got the smoked meat sandwich and the turkey sandwich. Both huge! The bread was ok, it's really not the star of the show. You basically just eat a pile of meat. Great pickles! The staff were extremely friendly.

Go early though. We arrived around 1140 and when we left about 20-25 minutes later there was a huge line up outside already."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've found a sandwich that I actually love, but: Schwartz is so GOOD!  It's pretty much the only sandwich I can think of ever actually having a craving for. 

Choose from lean, regular, or fatty beef, which will come between two pieces of rye and a slather of yellow ballpark mustard.  By \"choose\", I really mean that you should choose the fatty variety.  Just do it - you won't regret it. 

Moist, tender, truly smoked, pinkish beef is piled high between the bread.  I came here a few hours after Boullion Bilk and was considering stealing a bite off my friends.  Luckily, the friendly waitstaff encouraged* me to get my own sandwich.
* By encourage, I mean the gentleman basically threw the gauntlet by claiming he could eat 3 by himself so surely I would be able to finish 1.

Am so glad I took that challenge, because I would be kicking myself right now if I hadn't. In fact, I regret not having gone back again for more.  But ehh, I suppose my arteries will thank me for it later. 

If you don't speak or read French, not to worry, the lit menu on the wall is short, has the English version below it, and the staff have zero problems with English.  They're super used to tourists too, so they'll let you know what you should order.  Here's a hint: it's gonna be the smoked beef. 

You can pay at the front or at your table.  Cash only.  Open until 2am, so come here late at night just cause you can!"}
{"text":"The day we went, there was a huge line for the restaurant, so we did the take out. Still had to wait a while, but it was worth waiting for. Excellent smoked meat, potato salad and don't forget your dill pickles.  My kids loved it!"}
{"text":"Schwartz is is billed as \"the deli\" in Montréal. People compare it to Carnegie Deli and Katz's in NYC. While the smoked meat sandwich was quite good and much more affordable than the aforementioned delis it was nothing special. The menu doesn't even begin to compare to Carnegie Deli in terms of variety. It was raining that day we went so there was no line. We were in and out and 30 minutes so I can't complain about that. Is it worth the trip, yes. Is it legendary, no."}
{"text":"Perfect smoked meat sandwich in every possible way -- though of course it's by no means healthy. They're really filling, so unless you have a huge appetite, you could almost share one between 2 people. 

This place just feels legendary inside, like you're participating in something special. And it's true: the food is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Not worth waiting for this. So disappointed. We went in as a group of 4 and ended up ordering what they are known for. The meat was tough, the bread was cold and the mustard they added did not help. Did not live up to the hype. Spend your money on something else."}
{"text":"Ever walk for 45 minutes in dress shoes? I did. For a Schwartz's sandwich. Was it worth it? Put it this way...i've made that walk more than once. Yea yea yea it gets busy, but do you REALLY want to get a sandwich from a deli noone goes to? If you're smart about it you can get a seat and have your sandwich, pickle, and black cherry drink. Just go at off-peak hours. For example 11am. I was there 2 weeks ago and got a seat at 11am and never saw a line. I also like to go to the takeout counter after to grab an extra sandwich for the airport and usually grab a big vaccuum sealed chunk for my own sandwich party at home. Its about $100 for a 7lb hunk of happiness. That's right folks. Happiness has a price and it comes between two slices of rye with mustard."}
{"text":"Institution montrealaise ou manger un smoked meat de la façon la plus desagreable.pas d'alcool,on s'enivre au cherry coke une experience en soi.j'y amene tous mes visiteurs etrangers pour l'ambience et de la nourriture un peu inhabituelle.je frequente l'etablissement depuis plus de 40 ans!vraiment bon?vraiment agreable?mais on y retourne toujours!"}
{"text":"Best smoked meat sandwich I'd ever had thus far!!!  MUST try if you're visiting Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe the fact that the food wasn't kosher and that they serve bacon!"}
{"text":"They have the best smoked meat sandwich!

I wish I lived in Montreal.  I'd definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Fast. Don't come here if you don't want meat. Don't come here if you don't want to sit right next to other people or share a table with another party. Come here to eat delicious smoked meat. Period."}
{"text":"Two very important things:
1. Cash only
2. There are two lines: carryout and eat-in (two separate doorways)

I was not aware of the carryout door until I stood in line for about 20 minutes so I wanted to make sure everyone knew. It is cash only and you can buy refrigerated smoked meats, pastramis, and other meats in the carryout section.  There are also a few stools in the carryout section for you to eat there. Price-wise, it is pretty cheap in general, ~$10 CAD for a smoked sandwich which was pretty tasty. Way cheaper than Katz's in NYC, but I feel like it is not as tender or juicy. Line moves pretty quickly though so don't be deterred."}
{"text":"Good corned beef, not worth the wait.  Fries are a bad mess.  Get their mild and juicy pickles to cut through the grease instead.  Check the takeout entrance to the west of the main entrance.  Better off getting takeout it there if the line is shorter then just walk to Parc Jeanne-Mance for picnic and climb Mont Royal to burn all that calories you just inhaled."}
{"text":"Heard this place was a must stop in Montreal so we decided to give it a try. Line on a weekend was quite long, but wait time was no more than 30 mins (apparently much shorter if you go for take out).

The restaurant is small and old-fashioned from top to bottom. The menu is also very simple. Amongst three friends we ordered the smoked meat sandwich, small meat platter (meat with bread on the side), and a grilled liver steak.

The smoked meat (pastrami) was good: a nice balanced cut of fatty and lean meat that is warm, juicy, and flavorful. However, having tried various pastrami places in NYC, I have to say that the meat at Katz's is still a notch better. The rye bread here though is very good, and I was able to make many small sandwiches rather than having a big sandwich.

The liver steak is quite unique and great if you like liver, but that is a big if (also comes with a small frank on the side). My friend thoroughly enjoyed it though. Also on the house was coleslaw and pickles: I didn't try either, but friends said that they were both good.

Bottom line: Might be the best smoked meat around town, but definitely not the best I've ever had. Prices are on the higher end of things, but still worth trying out."}
{"text":"Totally overrated. The smoked beef is 50% fat. The pickles cost extra. Won't take credit or debit. Toilet - picture Trainspotting."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is always good for old fashion smoke meat.  Whether you order it as a sandwich or get a platter so you can share (they do charge a $1.50 for shared plates), it is worth it.

As usual, I always eat mine with pickles and wash it down with a black cherry coke to round out the favors.  They don't accept credit cards, so be sure to bring cash!"}
{"text":"So if you're in Montreal, get a smoked meat sandwich because it's a Montreal thing to do.  I love authentic old school delis - they have a certain vibe to them - a step back in time.   So we got a pastrami sandwich here..typical pickle on side with deli mustard.  I say 'pretty good'-the Montreal smoked meat is good if this place is The measuring stick."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat sandwich. Everything else here reminds me of a bus station, in fact a broom closet in a bus station.  It's cramped, crowded and dingy. The fries were greasy and soggy like you get waiting for a Greyhound. The service charmless and uninterested, like your average bus driver. Aside from the sandwich, there is nothing else to order. The sign on the door says something about Hebrew Charcuterie. So you should be able to order  matzo ball soup or a knish. Not here.  If you can wander in, no wait, I say get a sandwich. But if have to wait, it's not worth it.  Go across the street to Main.  And bus riders and drivers please accept my apologies. I too ride the bus. It's just a metaphor."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of smoke meat, but this sandwich blew my mind. If you are in Montreal it is a must eat! Medium Smoke meat sandwich, pickles, and black cherry soda. Fantastic service! Delicious food but a bit pricy for what your getting."}
{"text":"So with the US economy in recession, I was forced to be a traveler with a meal budget. Schwartz was answer to one of the best meals in the city with the least amount of $$ spent.

This is NOT your tourist trap. I sat right next to some local homies that were eating quietly after a long day from work. I also found myself quietly munching away once my food arrived. By the way, this is a sobering experience as they don't serve booze but no one was complaining as we happily washed down the sandwiches, slaw, pickles, fries down with sodas. Oh yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Not sure when I am returning to Montreal again but I just hope this place will last for another 50 years and not change one bit."}
{"text":"Yummy, historical, never fails... you MUST. You simply MUST have Schwartz's at least once in your life - this is a bucket list item!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended and due to its classic history of making Smoked Meats. Family was unfortunately disappointed by the cleanliness of the establishment it seems like they was someone in a rush to get us out. I can say that the food itself was good not as great as hyped up to be. Asked for orange juice and was given Soda instead. Unwrapped Straws were strewn on the table. 

Bottom line is it worth a visit? Probably if you're in Montreal for the first time or if you want a quick bite to eat as a takeout. In retrospect we probably should have just gotten a take-out sandwich from The Establishment next door and walked around the area. If you want even have a chance of sitting down you need to go during the down times in the afternoon after lunch around 3 to 4."}
{"text":"Great place, the best smoked meat sandwich in the world, everyone who comes to Montreal should try it no matter what"}
{"text":"Montreal is a great foodie town, and it has its staples.  French/Quebecois cuisine.  Bagels.  Destination restaurants like Joe Beef.  'Montreal smoked meat' is definitely on that list, though maybe not the first one that an out-of-towner like myself thinks of.  Once you get past that part and hear that this is a must-have, chances are Schwartz's will be the main place you hear about.

Schwartz's and the locals know that this place is popular.  The day before we visited while buying bagels at St-Viateur (another name you'll surely hear being held in high regard), the other patrons were raving about the length of the \"lineups\" in front of Schwartz's.  Schwartz's also realizes this, and in turn operates both a sit-down and carry-out side of their business, a major plus for moving the crowds through quickly.

The beef itself...pretty good.  If you're familiar with the corned beef, this has similar consistency, utilizing the same brine-curing process, but is actually kosher-style beef brisket.  Throw a bit of mustard on that and put it between 2 slices of bread, and that's all you need!  The amount of hype may have knocked it down a star, but if you go, you won't be disappointed.  Just remember to grab napkins on your way out...this is by no means the tidiest sandwich you'll ever eat."}
{"text":"There was a much-awaited hype for trying this place since it was very well-known both on tour guides and yelp. The food was good but the service wasn't good at all. Maybe that's the norm for super-famous places and I got to get more used to it, but by any standards the guy who waited on me was apathetic and just pushed me to have the smoked meat sandwich when I clearly wanted to try not only the smoked meat but other stuff on the menu. Whether or not this is a must try is totally up to you, but don't expect to be greeted and waited with a smile."}
{"text":"Small place with great smoked meat sandwiches!  Meat is very moist.  Be prepared to wait on line, rain or shine.  We'll definitely visit again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The poutine was tasty but nothing special. I had the smoked meat sandwich, full of fatty, poorly cut smoked beef that was nothing special in terms of flavour. I came here because everyone raves about Montreal's famous Schwartz's deli, but I found nothing to justify the cult following."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Just awesome.  Jam packed with people.  For two of us ordered the large plate of smoked meat, fries and poutine,  Massive plate of food comes out, and about half a loaf of bread.  Meat was tender, juicy, delicious, flavorful, spiced, fall apart in mouth incredible.  We didn't eat for 2 days afterwards.  Server was finny and friendly.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a kid. Honestly, people can debate smoked meat vs. NY pastrami, but Schwartz has my vote! 

Montreal has many great smoked meat places, but Schwartz will always have a special place in my heart. It's true that the meat tends to be a little dry compared to others, but that what I like. The spices are just right and the smoked meat always fresh. Not to mention all the must-have sides here are great: pickles, fries, coleslaw and a cherry coke! Pure perfection."}
{"text":"After a long walk at the botanical garden, and I can smell the deli meat as I walked in. Ordered the famous smoked meat sandwich with medium fat and poutine for extra carbs. The meat to bread ratio is 4:1, which I don't mind. Furthermore the mustard is a nice touch to the sandwich, spicing it a little on top of their specialty meat seasoning. Which becomes a topic of interest with my friends whom are trying it for the first time as well.

The meat comes in three options: lean, medium, and fat. As I've ordered medium, the amount of fat provided made the meats tenderness just right, juicy enough to not feel guilty and also tasty enough to feel enlightened.

The poutine was mediocre that made this store a four star instead of a five. Would totally be recommend and remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"I had heard about Schwartz's being the best smoked meat deli from reviews and later from a friend. I decided to get a sandwich to go from here one day. 

If you're going to eat the sandwich/meat on the day of getting it, they recommend to get the smoked meat warm. If you're going to save it for a couple of days, they recommend to get it cold as deli meat. You can also buy their famous mustards, but aside from the measly amount of mustard they put on the sandwich breads, they don't give you any mustard on the side if you're taking your sandwich to go. 

The meat was okay. I definitely had better smoked meat sandwiches in other places, where the meat would just dissolve in my mouth. This meat was just harder to swallow. It had a lot of fatty layers and biting a piece made it tougher and less delicious. 

Unlike some of the other reviews, I thought the sandwich portions were okay considering the price, which wasn't bad for a filling sandwich with a good chunk of meat."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest and most supple smoked meat I've ever had. Going to Schwartz's deli is most definitely an experience. This home style deli is known for its amazing meat and long line ups. If the main line is too long try the take out where you can still get the sandwiches, fries and pickles. 

It's a great alternative when it's cold! Also be sure to get the takeout meat to satisfy your cravings later"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Any time a restaurant fluffs its own wings claiming  \"be the best...\" or \"world famous...\" of something, that just means they are looking for tourists. Not the greatest smoked meat in town, very plain with portions that don't at all add up to the prices."}
{"text":"If you're hoping to get a table at Schwartz, you might have to plan your day around it.  The line-ups can be that long.

I'm one of the crazy fanatics who will wait over an hour in -20 degree (Celsius) weather in a snow storm just to get my smoked meat sandwich.  I average about 4 visits a year to this greasy joint and in between I sometimes have authentic Schwartz smoked meat brought back to Ontario for me.  

Let's start with the food:
Tastiest meat ever.  I almost always go for the smoked meat sandwich - medium-fat.  It's definitely on the greasy side, but the fat adds the juiciness.  We once shared a table with a local regular who was disappointed we didn't order full fat.  Her sandwich looked super juicy, but I'm not sure my heart could take it.  When my health-conscious friend ordered extra lean, I could see it was significantly drier.

Schwartz's french fries are my absolute favourite.  They're a thicker cut, they're super greasy and they're cooked just enough to be crispy on the outside but still have the softer middles.  

Steak, liver and pickles are also fantastic, but I have regretted not sticking to the sandwich.  The smoked meat is just that good.

Beverage:
Secret recipe - 1/3 regular Coke, 2/3 Cott's Black Cherry.  You have to order by the can, so you do the math.  The glasses they provide are tiny, but sufficient.  I don't think I've tried anything other than this cherry Coke concoction but the stacks of pop in the backroom suggest they offer a good variety of other beverages.

Atmosphere:
The reason there's usually a line-up outside Schwartz is because the restaurant is tiny. It's very narrow and there's not much room for a line-up inside.   On a cold day we're allowed to squeeze between the bustling waiters, the take-out customers and the customers eating at the counter.

The entire restaurant smells of meat.  Everything is covered in a film of grease.  This is all part of Schwartz being Schwartz.  There's a certain authenticity to the place that I just love.  The wall is covered with newspaper clippings of their success.  

The restaurant is very cozy.  You're pretty much sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, knee-to-knee at the small tables.  If your party is less than 6 you'll probably have to share a table with a friendly stranger or two.  The seats at the counter don't offer much room either, so if you prefer a bit more personal space, try to get there at an off-peak time.

If possible, use the washroom before you arrive.  The washrooms at Schwartz are pretty scary.

Service:
Every time I've been to Schwartz, our waiter has been friendly, efficient, fully bilingual and can do math in his head pretty quickly.  I'm impressed with their speed and accuracy even at the busiest of times.  

The staff can be a little rude to the hungry customers in line, but they seem to do their best to accommodate everyone.

It's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles where we have our share of world-class Jewish delis: Brent's and Canter's can rival just about anyone. Meanwhile, we don't have the around the corner, long lines that Schwartz's has, possibly because the above locations are much larger. Even with the massive hype Schwartz's gets via TV, social media, etc, it's not overblown. The smoked meat (or corned beef as many of us call it) it that good. It belongs amongst the best in North America, almost as good as Katz in NYC and at par with Harold's in Jersey, Caplansky's in Toronto and way better than Dunn's. 

Coming to Schwartz's isn't normally a quick stop. There always seems to be a crowd here. Patience is a must and if you are big into delis it's worth the wait, even though sometimes it's well over an hour. Think of it as an adventure and enjoy it. You'll be telling your friends and family about this experience at some point. And, unless you have a party of four don't expect your own table. They'll slap you at the same table with two others and there's nothing you can do about it. 

Keep in mind, this place doesn't have a dynamic menu. They focus on what they do well, smoked meat. And, if you come expecting that you'll be wowed during each bite. The tender, lean, juicy meat is unforgetabble."}
{"text":"Believe the hype.

Initially I couldn't believe it either. Then I walked in, sat down, bit into a fatty smoked meat sandwich, experienced extreme happiness (not as ostentatious as Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally) and sheepishly grinned. I bit my fingers and demanded another. The pickle and cole slaw were perfect complements. Sadly the black cherry soda didn't enhance the meal. The fries were overkill but were good for sharing.

The smoked meat sandwiches are superior to the sandwiches at infamous NY delis, such as Katz's, 2nd Ave and Carnegie. Yes I said it.

When I return, please have a medium and fatty sandwich ready for me. If the line is too long, I'll just order a pound to go.

{"text":"Split 1 full fat and 1 medium sandwich with a friend. Get a plate of fries, cherry coke, cole slaw and a pickle. Schwartz's is an experience one must take part of at least once in their life... Or as many times as possible."}
{"text":"Real good smoked meat but:
The smell while queuing outside is terrible. The place is everything but clean. Don t look under the table. And then, the extra fee to share a plate is a scam. It s not matter of cost, as the price overall is very good for what you get, it s just ridiculous to pay an extra to steal in your buddy's plate."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich! You just have to try it here! The sandwich is huge but very very tasty. It was fatty and delicious. It also wasn't dry and every bite was devoured in a detailed manner. For me, I always judge a sandwich by it's bread to meat ratio and this rocked my world! Must eat when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Still as good as ever. Don't be a sucker and stand in the restaurant line, take the other line that goes into the deli shop. You'll get the same sandwich and you may have to fight for a seat at the bar at the back but at least it will be quicker."}
{"text":"We intended to sit down and eat here, but with the long line out the door and a sleeping toddler, we decided to go to the take-out side and get a few things to eat at our hotel instead.  It did not take long to get out the door, and for about $65 we got a 5 pastrami sandwiches, one large container of cole slaw, two sodas and two bags of fries.  Here's what I thought:

- pastrami sandwiches - the way the wrap it in the paper, it looks like a tiny sandwich compared to what you see in photos on Yelp.  However, once you unwrap it you find a ton of meat inside.  The bread was soft and soaked with some fat, there was just a bit of mustard, and the pastrami was well seasoned.  It could be more moist, but the flavor was great.  You can actually smell how good and tasty it will be when you walk into the store!
- cole slaw - we got the kind without mayonaise, and I loved it.  It was lighter than the traditional cole slaw, yet still tasty
- fries - eh, I've had much better. I'd rather use up calories on another half sandwich.  The fries were soggy (even when I snuck one out of the bag in the car on the way back to the hotel), were not salty at all, and they looked like they were fried in old oil.  I could have done without the fries."}
{"text":"This place is always packed sun, rain or snow, and rightly so, it's worth the wait and the trip to Montreal if you don't live there. 

If you are going to order, you have to get the Fatty as the juices from the fat add an explosion of flavor in your mouth. 

I'm not even a fan of New York Style Reuben deli sandwiches but this is not a NY Deli sandwich, it's in a league of it's own."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian, and I still waited 25 minutes in line to experience this Montreal institution (and to introduce my wife to smoked meat).

I had the fries (OK), coleslaw (OK), rye bread (OK) and pickle (EXCELLENT).  My wife enjoyed her smoked meat sandwich.

Tip for veggies; don't come here thinking maybe you'll get a grilled cheese sandwich or salad...it's not going to happen.  Go for the experience...AND the pickles!  I shoulda had two!"}
{"text":"Don't do what I did and call it Pastrami, it's \"Smoked Meat\" lol.  What an amazing food experience; the staff was a little rude but unapologetically so and honestly it was one of the things I really grew to love about the place because you realize they're just that intense about making great smoked meat sandwiches and serving the enormous line of customers as best they can.  

Case in point, we had 8/9 of our party present at the door but told the owner we needed a table for 9... he got us our seats and immediately realized that one person was missing and asked where they were.  We said \"he's 10 minutes out still but we'll order for him\" and to our shock the owner responded \"no you wont; if you order it for him and I bring it out when he's not here the food will get cold and I don't serve cold smoked sandwiches I want him to have the best\".  At first I thought \"this guy is crazy\" until I ultimately ordered my own smoked meat sandwich with a side of spicy peppers and a kosher dill pickle... and wow, they aren't kidding.  The combination of just the right amount of bread, meat, and mustard made one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life.  By the time I finished our second bite I don't think anyone in the group missed the 9th guy anymore lol.  5 minutes later we were all taking photos with the owner and raving about the experience on Facebook... these guys are passionate about their food and it was a really special stop for our long-weekend in Montreal. 

Be patient, be friendly, and the staff will serve you one of the best smoked meat sandwiches you'll ever eat... enthusiastically recommended."}
{"text":"I was told by an Uber driver on my way to the casino, that I had to come here for a smoked meat sandwich. The more I thought about it, I thought what the hell kind of meat is it? Beef? Pork? Chicken? Very intrigued at this point I made it a priority to stop here for lunch on my way out of town.

Walked in around 2pm and this place is, jammed, crammed and crankin out some major sandwiches. This place looks like a little deli. I'm still surprised at how many people they shoved into this small area. The menu is limited but why come here for anything else but smoked meat, its what they are famous for! We each got the smoked meat sandwich, a coke and giant pickle. Surprisingly this sandwich is huge and amazing!

I'm still not really sure what kind of mean is exactly on this sandwich. Maybe is a cross between corned beef and brisket? It sure is delicious though and it comes out served with a slap of mustard served on a type of rye bread. This reminds me of the perfect hangover or drunk sandwich! I would also recommend a pickle they are huge and delicious! 

The best part about it we were seated, ate, and cashed out in about 15 mins! The place looks busy but are really only serving one thing so they get it out very quickly!"}
{"text":"A religious experience for the devotees of the Beef.

The original Montreal smoked meat sandwich. A pile of fatty, perfectly smoked meat with mustard between two modest slices of bread. The first bite is literally a life-changing experience. Literally. As in, \"taking words in their basic or most usual sense\". Your life will be different after your first bite.

Others have complained about the fries, and/or coleslaw; reviewing them as separate entities/menu items. This is nonsense. All in Schwartz's revolves around the smoked meat, and under necessity must be contemplated in its context. They are the perfect companions to the glory of the smoked meat sandwich, especially the Cott's black cherry soda.

The decor is relatively unchanged from the days of yore, a time before the omnipresent distractions of cell phones and other forms of invasive, food-experience-disrupting technologies. The common tables are another drive toward interaction with fellow man; a place where kings rub elbows with paupers.

No plastic payment is accepted. Cash only -- old school to the bone.

Nothing short of incredible."}
{"text":"This place is a Montreal legend for a reason.  I legit come back here every single time I come back and visit Montreal.  I always get the same thing:  fatty smoked meat sandwich with fries on the side.  The sandwich is perfect and a bargain at around $10.  I live in the states now and can't get anything close to this here."}
{"text":"Ah je suis désolée de tout casser... Il est vrai que tous les goûts sont dans la nature, mais là ça en est la preuve. C'est la première fois que je ne comprends pas la longue file d'attente sur le trottoir. A chaque fois... Quel est cet engouement?! Des gens venant de partout... pour goûter ce met... Rien, absolument rien d'original! 
Mais il faut tester apparemment, alors je ne vous dirais pas le contraire. Ainsi chacun peut en faire son expérience, mais le mienne en est restée à une seule visite.
Sans parler que la place est minuscule. Rien d'alléchant."}
{"text":"I came up with a foodie adventure list for my trip to Montreal and Swartz ranked #1. Having seen it mentioned on Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown: Montreal and other food travel shows, it was a must-try according to many people and I have to agree with them! I'm originally from California and this was my first time trying Canada's \"smoked meat\". It reminded me of a pastrami sandwich, but less greasy. My boyfriend and I each had our own smoked meat sandwich. Sharing is not caring in this instance, we both cleaned our plates. The sourdough bread and mustard really compliment the smoked meat, overall it was a great and hearty sandwich. 

Try their coffee. It was surprisingly pretty good."}
{"text":"I can see why people rave!  I went on a Tuesday afternoon and there was a line outside the door. ON A TUESDAY!!  The place is crammed. To crammed for my LA taste.  You share tables with strangers, bump into people, knock things over...  Tiny space.

But whatever the food was good!  I ordered a sandwhich plate. Someone should have warned me!!  They brought out sooo much food.  I had to box up like 2/3rds of my meal!  

The sandwhich however was delicious. Chunks of pink pastrami like slabs of meat. A pickle and mustard. Simple. But full of taste."}
{"text":"I was really stoked about Schwartz's due to the great comments I'd heard about it, so I was really disappointed.  When my wife and I walked in, I was surprised to find a dingy little hole in the wall with some serious hygiene issues.  The floor looked like it hadn't been mopped, the tables and walls looked dirty, and our seat next to the rear door gave us a glimpse into a backroom that might as well have had a big sign that says, \"RATS AND ROACHES - WELCOME!\"  Our waiter did his best impression of a gestapo when taking our order by refusing to smile, make eye contact, or even make any conversation whatsoever beyond, \"Yeah, so what do you want??\"

There are some great restaurants on Montreal.  This is not one of them.  Don't believe the hype.  The smoked meat is pretty good, but I don't think it was worth spending an appetite there if you're visiting from out of town.  They need to hire some friendly people, and they need to clean the place up.  Yeah, it's nostalgic.  Keeping it vintage cool, I get it.  Guess what...vintage cool doesn't mean you treat customers like crap and let your restaurant turn into a bathroom mop head.  Clean it up.  You have potential, but you have to deliver the whole package, not just a mediocre sandwich."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.   We had the meat \"brisket-like\" sandwiches on rye.  Superb!  The poutine was also very good as well.  Only thing was, we got there at 1:45 pm and there was a long line outside to have a sit down meal,  so we went to the \"togo\" area.  It was reasonably fast and we found a place, around the corner, in the shade, to stand and eat.  We read the on line reviews and they were right on. Not inexpensive but delicious.  I highly recommend Schwartz's for a great sandwich just allow a fair amount of time."}
{"text":"Surtout a cause de mon manque de patience flagrant, je n'ai pas mangé aussi souvent au Schwartz que j'aurais voulu. Il y a toujours un line up, et je hais les line up ! Si vous êtes chanceux et que vous pouvez avoir une table, alors la, débute une expérience culinaire. Le smoked meat maigre (je l'aime ainsi) avec moutarde, cornichon au sel et cherry coke : un petit délice rétro dans une ambiance simpliste. 

Si vous êtes comme moi et n'avez pas de patience, ils ont ouvert une petite shop a coté du restaurant ou vous pouvez acheter du smoked meat et autre produits du fameux delicatessen. Surprise ! vous pouvez prendre un sandwich pour emporter et aller le déguster ailleurs. Une option de choix lorsque la faim se fait ressentir.

Juste d'y penser j'ai faim."}
{"text":"C'est apparemment incontournable quand on vient à Montréal... et on a franchement bien aimé. Il vaut mieux arriver tôt ou atrd pour éviter de faire trop la queue. Les smoked meat sont vraiment bons, et le fait de se retrouver à table avec des inconnus est assez sympa"}
{"text":"This place is w1n.

The smoked meat sandwich lived up the the hype. My friend waited in line 30 minutes for it but it was well worth it.

Fries were fries, nothing special.

Missed out on their trademark cherry cola though, next time fo sure."}
{"text":"This place is as old-school and unassuming as it gets. Its a super hole-in-the-wall with a long table. Basically you wait to a seat opens up and jump on it. What is a smoked meat sandwich you say? Its a plate stacked with meat, another plate stacked with bread, mustard, and then dig in. So very delicious. order the Medium other wise it'll be too greasy or too dry. The only star i took was for seating. But then I kinda liked that old London feel; so 5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"SCHWARTZ'S IS A MUST-TRY WHEN IN MONTREAL! 

I have to give this place a 5/5 for how damn good the smoked meat sandwiches are. I highly recommend pairing the smoked meat sandwiches with fries and a pickle! The pickle is a nice complement to the heavy amount of meat in the sandwich. The fries are also a delicious side and are delicious when first served. 

 It is a typical dirty diner, so it's a very casual. The prices are reasonable for the quantity and quality of food. The service is EXTREMELY fast. We got seated within 10 minutes while they were packed. Most people stay here for about 30-45 minutes, so it is definitely a quick meal. You also pay for your check at the front of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Definitely compared well to great delis in NYC. FYI it's cash only. The smoked meat sandwich and coleslaw were particularly good."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Montreal.. but my friend told me Schwartz was one of the must go places. At first i was really anal about it because i wasn't a really a big fan of meat and it was like a deli(In US we all know how a deli is like.. Especially in NYC... LOL ). But the waiter described where and how smoke meat was made in their place. He even swear to me that i wouldn't be disappointed.. if i did he would offered me a free meal. He even told me that everyone comes for the order Number 4. 
 It was delightful and worth eating. It wasn't that pricey."}
{"text":"Has always (since i was 18) been a pit stop when visiting MTL either coming from or going to Karmasutra. Best smoked meat i've ever had bar (rafaeli) none. Here's why: 

Katz's - too dry and has this sulphuric chemical taste 
Carnegie - tasteless not smokey and not enough fat 
Queens/Kings Deli - on par but doesn't have the personal nostalgia of this long standing establishment.

Reason it's not a five is the long wait, the travel time to MTL, and s***tty attitude of the waiters - ahh their just characters. Park at the lot behind Moishe's. slaw, pickles,and the \"fat cut\" are a must."}
{"text":"Great service and yummy food!! Don't miss the coleslaw, pickles, and smoked meat sandwich!"}
{"text":"Best smoked meat in town! ...but given the lineup's you could consider Dunn's downtown as a runner-up."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype! I just hope the next time I'm in town, no one I'm with insists they NEED to stop here. 

Food: 2/5 Way to over priced. $10 for a tiny sandwich.
Service: 4/5 Quick and efficient.
Environment: 2/5 Cramped, rushed.
Washrooms: ?/? I just wanted out.
Worth it?: 2/5 Not worth it. Tourist trap.

Everytime I am in Montreal I feel the need to come here. Everytime I do I am disappointed. This place is over hyped and is overall not worth it. Expect to wait in line for an hour. After that expect to pay $10 for a tiny sandwich with no sides. Barely a snack. We were in and out in 12 min. That's after we waited an hour to get in that is. 

It has been way to many years for this place to be the best smoke meat place in town. There are other places that are better, better priced and offer a better experience.

I feel rushed Everytime as if I'm a cog in a well oiled money making machine. I don't think I will be back unless someone insists they HAVE to go."}
{"text":"Go to the take out line!! If you don't mind taking it to go and eating it. When we got there, there was a huge line (which supposedly is normal). But there is a take out door that you can go to. We didn't have to wait at all to order and get our smoked meat sandwiches.

The sandwich itself was really good. I'm not a huge fan of smoked meat, but I enjoyed this a lot. And the fact that I didn't have to wait was a bonus."}
{"text":"Good sandwich. To avoid huge lines for dine in, you can walk in next door and order a sandwich to go. The sandwiches are actually pre packed and the actual wait is just for the cashier to ring you up. We got the smoked meat sandwich and it was good but not the best meat sandwich I have ever had. The pickle was also a bit too vinegary and pickled for my taste. This was definitely a fun experience and worth a visit."}
{"text":"If you're in Montreal and you're a fan of smoked meats, you should definitely give Schwartz's a try!

They have delicious smoked meat which is best when asked for medium fatty! The bread was average - nothing to write home about, and it definitely could be tastier. But it's okay, the meat the star anyway! It's salty, peppery, and just the right amount of fatty (you can always ask for more or less fatty meat). 

If you want to sit inside, chances are that there is a pretty long line. If you want to skip the line, consider take-out because there is a separate, much shorter line.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Oh its all true. Yelp reviewers aint lying about this place. Its the simple things that please me mot. No flair no fuss just amazingly well done food and better than excellent service. I was expecting a pastrami sammy what i got was a weird 3 sided meat feast that curled my toes. Its so good i have to go back because I inhaled it before I could get a picture. I'm not even sorry  although me moaning at the bus stop did cause some stares. But poutine here is just what I needed. Poutine fries gravy and cheese curds sounds weird tastes great. This place has been around over 50 years for a good reason. They have a smoked beef sandwich that is Texas sized and Texan approved. We like our meat in the Lone Star state and this bad boy is that deal."}
{"text":"It's a $10 \"smoked\" meat sandwich. There's a lot of meat, it's tender and good. It's served simply on thin bread with a little mustard. It's iconic and worth a try once. Would I ever go back? No, but I'm glad I checked it out. 

Anyways, here's the problem. WARNING, they don't take credit card here in purpose. When you walk in they do say, \"we do accept USD\". Okay, but once you go up to pay, you find out it's an even USD$ TO CAN$ PLUS 10% exchange (as of June 2018). I've traveled all over the world, and this is a first for me. That's basically close to a 40% exchange fee. WTH?! I hate any place that won't take credit card because the CC companies charges the merchant 1.5%, but then turn around and want to charge 40% on their paying customers? That's just horribly wrong. I told them that and the guy was clearly offended.  His response was \"well, they do it downtown too\", and \"in the USA they don't take Canadian dollars\", and \"we are not a bank\" (yeah, more like loan sharks!) Bottom line is if they don't want to take CC, then they should offer something on planet Earth, not 40%!"}
{"text":"Had to come here due to its reputation and recommendations from the locals. We arrived to find a small restaurant with a pretty good line outside. The place was packed with long tables you share with strangers, which was a plus for me but I know not everyone like this. 
The smoke meat was good, not great. My sandwich had big chunks of fat in it which is not my thing at all. The fries were very good. Not sure I would go back with so many other great choices here.
Bring cash!!! No cards accepted here."}
{"text":"Love this place, been going here since I was a kid. Best smoked meat in town, don't listen to anyone saying otherwise. Best to go off-peak hours, so early when it opens or before the dinner rush, if you want seats. Otherwise, they have a pick-up counter (with limited bar stools) next door, but sometimes even this place is jam packed.

Order: medium sandwich with a French fries and a cherry coke (pickles and such if you like that too)."}
{"text":"I've been going to Schwartz's since the 70's. It's been bought and sold and kept it's quality. Not so much anymore. Owned by Chinese, quality has hit \"rock bottom\". Which is a good description of the texture of the meat these days. Dry, and hard. Try something else. Pete's, or if you're in the hood, get a steak at Moishes."}
{"text":"Kind of a huge deal in Montreal but honestly, the food was only...good. It was tasty smoked meat and bread on the menu with some fries and side options but they focus on that brisket. The meat itself was saltier than I liked and the lean was a bit dry while the medium was way too fat. Good thing our wait was short being a weekday afternoon because I don't really get all the hype? The poutine we ordered was surprisingly good though! Not too salty and very crispy fries not quite drowning in gravy, it was my favourite thing here...not to say don't come but I'd prefer waiting for something better. It's worth it to say I've tried it though!

Although rushed and quick service, the people working there are really nice."}
{"text":"The smoked meat is good but end of the day, it's smoked meat.  About 1/4 of the smoked meat was a bit drier than I had liked.  Overrated reputation?  A bit.  Service is prompt and some of the servers are very friendly.  Some are just unnecessarily rude."}
{"text":"First time trying a smoked meat sandwich and it was delicious. We had a food guide that recommended them and it did  it disappoint."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich is very simple. Bread, mustard, meat, done....but omg simple perfection!! It's gotta be one of the best I've had! 
The staff was SUPER friendly and realizing I was not from around here helped me out with my order.  I felt so welcomed! Love the food, amazing staff...what else would you want?!"}
{"text":"This place lines up, but for a reason. It's a classic and a must if you've never been. The draw here is the Montreal Smoked meat, which is so tender and moist. Between the four of us, we ordered two large smoked meat plates. One fatty, and one medium. It's good to get both if you have enough people so you can mix the fatty meat with some of the leaner cuts. 

With this order, they bring out two plates of smoked meat and a side of bread, so you can make your own sandwiches. I'd say for four people, two large plates is prob a little excessive. It's also nice to get a pickle or two on the side.

They also have black cherry coke, which is a nice to wash all the meat down."}
{"text":"The smoked meat.sandwhich is devine! I ordered the medium fat and it tastes sooo good"}
{"text":"Katz is still #1, but it's better than Langer's!

Also... cheaper. :P

Get the smoked meat sandwich. That's what everyone comes here for. 
It's juicy but not as fatty as Katz. Also, if you go late at night ... you won't have a wait. 


Seating is limited and service is ok. They might charge you if you share a sandwich - questionable ... only if they hate you I guess haha. 

Don't go AT closing time though, cuz you will be asked to leave. 
Unless you're a big guy. No one wants a beat down at night."}
{"text":"Getting this to go, at the separate entrance, was extremely quick. 

The sandwich is not exactly \"deli style\" in portion, as a person can easily finish 1.5 to 2 of these sandwiches. However, at $10 a sandwich, the value is still incredible compared to Katz's in NY, which is almost twice the price.

As a New Yorker, a comparison is expected. I would love to say that \"they\" make it better than \"us,\" but that is not the case.

The bread is lacks some rye flavor and ability to hold up the sandwich. The meat is tender, fatty, and delicious, but a bit too fatty."}
{"text":"I saw the line outside on a -30C afternoon while my toes froze and I considered calling a taxi to my hotel 5 minutes away, and thought to myself, it can't be THAT good.

It's that good.

Being a Montreal landmark this place gets packed. Its not a very large to begin with so expect to sit elbow to elbow with a stranger if you do happen to get a seat.

We lucked out as we got there at about 11 and it was mostly empty. The waiters were nice and patient. I heard them repeat over and over again, \"well smoked meat is our trademark...\" to customers who didn't know what to order.

Won't say much else seeing as with 600+ positive reviews, I'm sure everything that needs to be said has been said."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend in Montreal and accidently happened upon this gem of a deli.  It was about 11:30PM when i popped in, and the place was all but mine.  I asked my sandwich artist what i should have, and he quickly replied  \"the smoked meat sandwich young man\".  Smoked meat sandwich, fries side of spicy red peppers with a coke, and i was a half buzzed and completely stuffed man."}
{"text":"Famous Schwartz's! I am really overwhelmed about the portion of meat... Feel like nothing has changed after three huge bite Hhh:)
Smoke meat is good, but not that unforgettable.. Maybe my expectation is too high:) I asked for a medium fat one, but I think it would taste better if it contains higher proportion of fat XD
If I ever come back to Montreal, I would still like to give it a shot:)"}
{"text":"If you like the meat this is the deli for you. Though the price of the sandwich has risen out of control from the usual 6$ per now its close to 9$ per. I still pay for their delicious smoked meat sandwich, after work on most days i like to drop in for at least 1."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! I've had my share of smoked meats in NY (Katz, 2nd Ave Deli, Carnegie), but this place was completely comparable. The smoked meat sandwich was exactly the right portion with lots of meat smoked to perfection and not too salty (a huge pet peeve of mine is when meat/food in general is too salty). The mustard to go along with this was great as well. I highly recommend stopping by if you get the chance! 

Note: since the line went out the door for the restaurant, we went next door to the takeout shop and ate in the back -- perfect if you're with a small group and want to enjoy the food without the wait.

{"text":"A Montreal institution which I stumbled upon while walking around. I saw this huge line and regular patrons raved about this place...So we waited. It took about 45 min. Singles and tables for 2 were easier to get. I got the staple meat sandwich apparently medium was the way to have it prepared a black cherry soda and fries (tangy slaw and sour pickles-no half sours here). It is an old school place now owned by Celine Dion and the vibe is NY deli. The meat is smoked somewhere between corned beef and pastrami...but smoked. It was ok kind of dry and heavily smoked. I've had much better meat in many other deli's and there is no comparison to Katz's which is in a league all its own.  Also the sandwich comes with mustard without even asking which is not a problem for me just an FYI for you. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to return and certainly not wait 45 minutes for a table again."}
{"text":"Great smoked sandwich, and we had a lot of fun watching the staff just enjoying themselves and serving everybody with smiles on their faces.
The price (~10$) is fairly high though, I understood that it used to be cheaper, but the place was completely full either way, so I would do the same.
Had a good time, and glad I had the experience of eating there, not sure if I'll come back though..."}
{"text":"Why isn't there a Schwartz's located in New York City?

But I digress...

If you are EVER in Montreal and do NOT pass by Shwartz's deli then you my friend are missing out. 

I personally am not a fan of pastrami or anything like that, but I knew I wanted to try Montreal's famous smoked meat while I was in town. 

When you first walk in this looks like your typical meat shop/deli all wrapped into one. I ordered the smoke meat poutine from a rather friendly/sarcastic guy behind the counter. They didn't have small to go containers so he offered the larger container and actually filled the entire thing for me and my friend (who ordered the same) at no additional charge. This had to be the best poutine I had by far while I was in Montreal.

Don't know what poutine is? Well picture this: french fries (at the bottom), gravy, cheese curds, and a myriad of Montreal's famous smoked meat. This is a popular Canadian dish and you should not leave Canada without having tried it.  

Towards the back of the establishment there is limited seating for patrons. However, they have a bulletin board with newspaper clippings, photos, and notes from patrons. It was amazing to see how many people have come to Shwartz's from all over the world. Trust me when I say all those people weren't lying when they named Shwartz's the best deli in all of Montreal.

Tip: They accept credit cards, but there is a minimum in place."}
{"text":"The best smoked meat in town! The lines are always long but it's worth the wait. Some people make not like sitting on a table with other people, but I don't mind it. Also, if you're claustrophobic try not to go during their busy times in the day (which is almost never). It gets a bit crowded. But overall, the food is worth the experience! I would suggest the medium smoked meat, fries, coleslaw and the yummy pickles. Yum!"}
{"text":"We come back to this place every year that we come to the F1 race in Montreal.  This year we sat at the counter.  We had a smoked meat sandwich, pickle, fries, and a cherry soda.  Classic."}
{"text":"I've been to this Montreal institution many a times, mainly because my travel companions always clamor to come here.  They seems to love it as meat lovers, but in my opinion as a so-so meat lover, their smoked meat sandwich is just ok.  The sandwich is huge, perhaps too big, which takes away the enjoyment of the meal itself.  Bottom line, if you love meat, you'll likely love this place, but if you are indifferent  towards it, the meat will not win you over to team meat."}
{"text":"So, so good. Every time we visit Montreal without making time for Schwartz's a little part of me dies. This is simply the best place for smoked meat. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Some people seem to get steak, but I have no idea how they manage to resist the sandwiches. 

There will be a line. Just wait in it - you won't regret it. If you're getting it take-out, though, just head next door rather than waiting to get in to the main restaurant because they have all of the same food and it will be much faster.

There's nothing fancy about this place. If you're in a small group there's a pretty good chance you'll get sat at a table with people you don't know and there are no frills on the menu. It's crowded as heck, with the quintessential diner feel. But everyone is in a good mood because the food is so good and it's great fun to watch the guys behind the counter fooling around, yelling out orders and slinging out sandwiches. 

And that's what you should get, by the way. Medium (or maybe fattier, but medium's always been enough for me) smoked meat on rye, or a smoked meat platter with rye bread so that you can make multiple sandwiches. 

Be prepared to have a sandwich appear in front of you very quickly and for it to take a moment or two for you to figure out how to wrangle the huge pile of delicious meat for which two pieces of rye seem wholly inadequate to contain. Yes, you'll make a mess. Then you'll go fishing for all the little bits of meat you drop, lest they go to waste. I always order my sandwich with a dill pickle, even though I don't normally eat dill pickles. The acidity cuts the fat in the meat beautifully, plus there's just something about the smoked meat, rye, mustard and pickle combination. The boyfriend gets fries, which are only OK in my opinion. If you have enough room for fries it seems to me you've got enough room for extra smoked meat.

So yes. It's good. It's worth the wait. Don't cheat yourself, just go."}
{"text":"My first time trying the famous smoked meat - I loved it, even if it may have been expensive.  Interestingly, the mugs they had on sale were pretty cheap, so I got one as a souvenir.  I appreciated the honest service - they warned me that the turkey sandwich is just turkey deli meat purchased elsewhere, so not to get that for my wife."}
{"text":"Not sure I have much to add relative to others. It's an institution and it's the sort of restaurant that does exactly one thing. The meat is flavorful and tasty. I'm not sure it's quite in the 5-star range of being something that I'd travel out of my way for; my personal taste prefers pastrami (I value spice over salt). Things other than the meat were less impressive; the pickle was definitely underwhelming compared to what I'd expect from this iconic of an institution."}
{"text":"Had I written this review over 7 or 8 years ago, I would have given Schwartz 5 stars, however, having been there a few months ago, I am quite disappointed.

First of all, let it be known that I do not, under any circumstance, ever stand in line for a restaurant. Waiting for 10 min for a table is fine, but standing in a long line in the street for a restaurant is a no-no. There are way too many excellent restaurants in the city for that. However, with this restaurant, standing in line seems to now be a prerequisite to getting a table. 

That being said, you'd expect the food to be out of this world. But it's not. You'd expect to have some phenomenal sandwich that melts in your mouth. But you do not. Instead, you get a normal sandwich (better sandwiches at Reuben's IMHO) usually with a lot of fat (even the lean) and not a lot of flavor. 

Really not worth the wait. Go somewhere else...the lines are there because of the long standing rep that Schwartz got a long time ago.."}
{"text":"We got some take out sandwiches and it was not as good as the reputation. The service was fast though many people are usually in the line. I do not miss it but worth the experience. 
Parking is a headache therefore plan ahead where you place the car!"}
{"text":"Reading through these comments and I realize some people have it all wrong. It is smoked meat which is beef not pastrami, the sandwiches are half a pound of meat on 2 pieces of rye bread and some mustard. The traditional sandwich is medium, so if you are ordering a lean sandwich expect it to be dry. It is a deli not a gourmet restaurant so don't criticize the environment. 
P.S. It is the best smoked meat sandwich"}
{"text":"Yes..it is on my \"must-eat-list\" before i visited Montreal b/c of its high rating on yelp..I usually am not into sandwich ..i had doubt before trying it...BUT it was as good as people described on yelp..it definitely deserved a FIVE star review.....it is known for its hot sandwich...after tax it is about 11 Can dollars...yes..it is overpriced for a sandwich ..but it has so much meats in the sandwich..and it is so GOOD...so juicy and flavorful! ..it has some fat to it..but not too much..the sandwich looked small..but it was really filling...I highly recommend this place for people visit Montreal!..and i recommend to get take-out to avoid long line and avoid going at lunch or dinner time.."}
{"text":"Good food, amazing price, lots of character and history! They've been there since 1928!!!! Oh, did I say that the food was great? It's a busy place though, be prepared to stay in line."}
{"text":"got the smoked meat sandwich...it was pretty good but i'm not sure it justifies the half hour wait in the below freezing cold (on a saturday)

also, i don't see the big deal with the cherry cola?!

FYI passed by on a weekday and there was no line."}
{"text":"Legendary Jewish deli up on the famous St-Laurent Boulevard.  Personally, this is my favorite Jewish deli in the world.  Schwartz's smoked meat sandwiches blows NYC Katz's deli pastrami sandwiches out the water, AND at a fraction of the price.  I got into a heated debate about this with one of my best friends from Brooklyn.  Finally, a popular chef and Gourmet Mag writer from NYC chimed in and declared Schwartz's as the undisputed winner! http://www.gourmet.com/restaurants/2009/03/smoked-meat-versus-pastrami

Schwartz's has a deep and storied history in the city of Montreal and has been around since the early 20th century. It is an iconic establishment and has seen visits from world famous dignitaries and celebrities.  

Bottom line, this is where you go to get a solid smoked meat sandwich at a blue-collar price.  Lean or fat are your two options. Gets no better than that!"}
{"text":"Long lines move quickly at this acclaimed Montreal smoked meats deli/restaurant.  

A half hour wait in the pouring rain was worth the delicious tastes of Schwartz's smoked brisket.  Orders of fries are small, but cooked well.  Pass on the pickles.  

Service is quick and if you want to pick up some to go, there is a deli portion next door."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat sandwich in Montreal or canada for that matter 

This rivals Katz deli in New York 

Both are excellent but I think Katz is just slightly better 

Get anything with a smoked meat in it

But this is much cheaper then New York"}
{"text":"Schwartz's is most likely the best Kosher style sandwich you can get in Montreal and perhaps the entire province. As a New Yorker we have heavy hitters such as Katz's Deli and Carnegie's so the bar is set pretty high. Schwartz's does a great job, the high speed line is efficient and the sandwich is the right amount to fill one person (Katz's you need at least 2 people to eat the thing along with a fork and knife, which can be inconvenient when on the go). 
Advice: if you are in Montreal you must visit for lunch. If you say that's it? You don't understand the historically tasty and simplistic Kosher style sandwich culture"}
{"text":"I am still reeling on how disappointing this was. Dry meat that smelled like body odor, stacked high on stale bread and slathered with mustard. The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly- but that doesn't make up for how disappointed I was with this foul smelling sandwich. I'm happy there wasn't a line when we went because I would have pretty disgruntled if I had waited for this. It's a landmark so I truly wanted to love it, but I have been to several deli's that do this simple sandwich so much better."}
{"text":"We got to Schwartz right when they opened so the take out line wasn't long. They are not friendly to those who aren't in the know, not that I care. I can deal with a bad attitude for a great deli sandwich but this place was a disappointment. 
I got two smoked meat sandwich and one turkey for my mother in law. 
The smoked meat was waaaaay over salted and dried out and crumbly. I make better corned beef at home. The bread was good but was like a sturdier wonder bread, small. 
The turkey was plain ol salty lunch meat. God forbid, you ask for lettuce and tomato!! Which they don't have btw. Or onions. 
I would've been pissed if I had waited in a long line. Skip this joint. They don't know good meat.
Cash only."}
{"text":"C'est simplement le meilleur smoke meat au monde.
Il a évolué au cour des années et pas toyjours pour le mieux.  Comme le grill qui n'est plus au charbon de bois.  Les notions de lean medium ou gras qui n existe plus ... mais leur combo est toujours aussi bon
le service aussi et les gros pickles wow.
Une vie doit contenir au moin une visite à  cet endroit"}
{"text":"Best smoked corned beef.  If I'm ever back in Montreal, I'll make sure to visit Schwartz's!"}
{"text":"Smoked beef yummy... line up sucks. Just make sure don't forget your pickle. Twice the line up sucks big time"}
{"text":"Im a local and I've never understood the allure. It's meat on a bun.   It's not bad,  but not remarkable either."}
{"text":"short wait outdoors on a friday night in the cold. 10-15min wait. sat by the door and cashier. 1 waiter for the whole place and the other staff inside the counter area. got the #4 which is the smoked meat. it was tender. got coleslaw and a black cherry soda. everything was good. i haven't had Katz back home but now i must try. it's 9.75$ for the sandwich. just eat and go. definitely a must try when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"C'est vrai que c'est le meilleur smoked meat que j'ai jamais mangé. C'est un plat toujours réconfortant, pas cher et succulent.

L'attente en vaut la peine, mais pourquoi pas le prendre pour emporter."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but you get the best smoked meat. Nothing compares to Schwartz's in smoked meat.  A must if you are in Montreal. And, be ready for a line up outside."}
{"text":"We always come to Schwartz every time we visit , but today's sandwich wasn't as good as I had expected. The meant was a bit dry and too lean for my liking. The pickles are 6 bucks each ! Outrages ! Anyways still recommend this a must try."}
{"text":"Schwartz's may have the most delicious corned beef sandwich anywhere on earth, truly unbelievably delicious.  And, in a cool neighborhood."}
{"text":"Worst staff ever, really rude and hasty. If you want good smoked meat, just cross the road and go to Main's Deli. Schwartz is not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is classic. Sit at the counter and order the smoked meat sandwich. It's unlike anything you've ever had and totally delicious. Try to get there early as this place gets crowded, but the turnover is pretty quick. This is one of Montreal's cant-miss spots. Also grab some dry rub on your way out; works great on your steaks at home. Just rub it down, grill it up, oui oui."}
{"text":"The traditional smoked meat sandwich was incredible. Luckily, we were on a food tour so we didn't wait in a long line (which was there every time we passed by) but under different circumstances, the wait would have been well worth it."}
{"text":"Went on the holiday weekend and the lineup  was going down the street.  We opted for take out instead of waiting for a seat.  They had all the fixings we needed to make our own sandwiches so we went that route.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Schwartz is a classic deli with a no frills, no bulls*** approach. From the store front you immediately see meat, waiting for you to devour. We got the platter, which charges extra per person, where you can make your own sandwiches. Personally, if you're not picky about how your sandwich is made, I would just order that straight up. The pickles were perfect: sour and garlicky, and the poutine, though nothing to write home about, complemented the meal nicely. I loved the down to earth nature of this place, the staff are friendly, and we got a table quick."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but a little fatty for my tastes.  The place was a bit overcrowded. Certainly a unique and important Montreal experience, but not the most pleasant"}
{"text":"Must try! 
Friendly staff 
Price is excellent 
Don't be discouraged by long wait line, it will pass quickly. There is take away option too."}
{"text":"I was raised as a devout Christian until the age of about 13 when I decided I would rather not spend two minutes before every meal appealing to a deity who I didn't believe in or spend Sundays uncomfortably sitting next to strangers who seemed to like to give away money to tax-free organizations whose pockets seemed to continue swelling while the \"missions\" they supported seemed to keep suffering in comparison.

My gripes with organized religion aside, until I went to college, my impression of Jewish food consisted only of things that were somewhat hinted in the bible about the Israelites' travails in the desert -- I think up until about 18 I believed that the story of the Jews were that of an overzealous nation led by a capricious voice in the sky who pretty much gave and took away land from his/her own people, while at the same time depriving them culinarily by forcing them to eat unleavened bread and order well-done steaks all the time.

I was pleasantly surprised, when I was first introduced to a proper reuben at Schilo's Deli in San Antonio, and my perception and admiration of Jewish cuisine had been on the rise ever since then; from that point I made it a point to pilgrimage all the holy sites of all that is bagel and/or smoked meat -- I never even once would have imagined that one of those holy sites would have been in the beautiful city of Montréal.

If you've read this far in my review, you'll notice that I have yet to make a single constructive comment that would be construed as being part of a review. That's because I haven't. I can't quite put into words what I think about Schwartz's, because it's so very much like every landmark Jewish deli I've been to, but at the same time so different as well.

The atmosphere at Schwartz's is one you'd expect from any popular establishment in a bustling city. I've walked and passed by Schwartz's at least four times and each time there was a huge line in front of both the restaurant and the take out area. Whereas the take out area is indeed miles faster than waiting in line to be seated at the restaurant, you still have to wait about 30-35 minutes to get your hands on any sort of tangible food while having to suffer through the alluring aroma of freshly-drained, smoked-for-many-hours meat invading ever orifice of your body as you stand (yes, your dog will love the way you smell after you leave this place)

The food here is mindblowing if you've never tried a brisket/smoked meat sandwich before. If you have, it's just like anything you'd get at Katzs'/Second Ave/Herschel's, except Schwartz's sandwich packs in around the same amount of meat as the aforementioned places (except for Second Ave's. Nothing beats a whole pound of brisket sloshed in between two pieces of rye bread) into three tiny pieces of white, almost wonderbread-esque bread (think Texas BBQ.) It's almost like a poorly constructed Pyramid that was built to preserve a cow that met a horrifying death, and if that wasn't enough, incinerated extremely slowly so to keep all its juices locked into the flesh. Disturbing mental images aside, it's pretty amazing.

The price point is probably what sets Schwartz's apart from most of the Jewish delis I've been to. Whereas you'll come out of places like Katzs' and Second Ave about 20-25 dollars poorer after a meal, Schwartz's only charges 7.75 CAD per sandwich. One can maybe make the argument that Katzs' and Second Ave makes up the difference in the amount of time you don't spend waiting for your food(nothing beats being able to walk up to the Sandwich line at Katzs', sampling the specimen from whence your sandwich meat came, and watching it being constructed right before your eyes within 2 minutes of entering the establishment.) My friend and I saw the pictures online and made the mistake of thinking that one sandwich would not be filling enough and that we'd each need to order two or three. That was also a huge mistake.

All in all a great establishment in a great part of town. I'd definitely recommend Schwartz's as a part of the Montréal experience to anyone visiting the city. I don't know if their online catering/order service delivers to the US as well, but I'm really kicking myself for not grabbing one of their ready-to-heat brisket vacuum paks for my drive home."}
{"text":"Oh how I missed this place since the last time I came.  This place gets busy quickly and lineups are down the sidewalk.  The smoked meat is amazing especially with the mustard.  Remember to down it with a cherry cola. Yummy. Till next time"}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal over the weekend and was told that I needed to try this place. It was a great recommendation and I fully agree with that advice. If you're going to Montreal you should definitely make time to eat at Schwartz's.

I will warn you that the line was very long, however, it was worth the wait!

No need to look at the menu here you NEED to get the Smoked Meat. Their special is the smoked meat sandwich, fries and a cherry cola. I switched the cola to normal coke with my order and was in heaven.

Giving Schwartz's a 5 star rating is a no brainer. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Having heard of this place even living from out of province, you know it's a must try! I decided that it was time to finally find this place in the Jewish quarter of Montreal (which seems to be very Portuguese now)

It's literally a hole in the wall but it's pretty efficient having take out in one completely separate entrance, and the sit down part in another unit (although it would be nice if they could just combine that all)

We got a table right away for 2 on Thursday at 3pm. I had a hard time looking for a menu due to the seat I had but to my embarrassment there were two large wall menus I just didn't bother looking up! It does reduce fumbling in the tight space so that is nice. I did notice the staff were friendly and actually having legitimate conversations with customers which definitely gave the nice cosy family vibe.

I had meat sandwich with poutine and a tea. He had meat sandwich with a pickle and black cherry soda. I was super jealous because his juicy pickle went perfectly with the sandwich and the soda was so good!!! Luckily he was willing to share :')

Washrooms were clean and surprisingly there was one for each gender considering how small the place was I thought that was impressive! 

One improvement I have is I wish the bread slices for the sandwich were a bit thicker as I feel like the bread was too soggy due to the amount of meat grease and mustard that fills up the bread.

I would come back again to order a meat sandwich, pickle, and black cherry soda. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Midway through my first smoked meat sandwich, I ordered a second.  It was there in three minutes.

They have a heck of a system.  Go there and see it.  Buy a shirt if you can."}
{"text":"Holy cow! This place is busy!!! We waited in line to get sandwiches outside of the deli--yes, outside, and it took a while but we were excited to try out this famous deli. We ordered about $70 of sandwiches for the road, and while it was being packed, we looked at the variety of mustards and observed the packed interior. Every table was taken. Thank goodness we didn't come to sit down!

So, we ate the sandwiches on the way in the car and they were so scrumptious, I actually thought about going back to actually get more!!"}
{"text":"Ugh...to be honest been here quite a few times and it's becoming more and more lackluster. Both my S.O. and I had better smoke meat sandwiches elsewhere. We didn't think the smoke meat sandwich was balanced at all. Everything (flavour of smoke meat, amount of mustard, bread not making it any better) was pretty meh. Nothing special and to be honest it does not live up to it's hype."}
{"text":"Decided to give Schwartz a try because it's apparently a must-have when in Montreal. 

The line wasn't too long. Probably a 15 minute wait. We paid around 40$ for 2 smoked meat sandwiches, one Cherry cola (recommended by them), regular cola and fries. It definitely hit the spot and I loved the tenderness of the beef and how it was seasoned. Everything went well together. In the end it got a little dry, but just put some mustard in the sandwich and that'll solve your problem! The portions were pretty big in my opinion as well...So for $9.60 that's a pretty good deal for me. 

One thing I noticed was that the bread used was just regular bread...Would be nice if it were a little bit less flimsy!

I would come back for another sandwich."}
{"text":"Holy Smoked Meat! 

This place is a dump, but the smoked meat sandwich sure does make up for the lack of service Schwartz's provides. As I'm writing this review, my mouth is salivating for luscious fatty smoked meat with yellow mustard on soft rye bread. As a New Yorker, I've had Katz's and Carnegie and it pales in comparison to it's Canadian counterpart. 

My BFF and I were so infatuated with the smoked meat that we even bought a lb each to smuggle across the border (12.95 lb CAD). Sadly enough, it's just not the same after you make numerous attempts to revive the moistness and tenderness of the meat. It sorta just fell flatline. 

Beep, Beep, beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep...... 

If you make it into Montreal, Schwartz's is a must try."}
{"text":"Just A OK. I almost gave this place a 4 star rating but  I'm not getting peer pressured to jump on the bandwagon if it wasn't quite there for me. 

While the smoked meat was delish, the sandwich was really bare. I understand the meat should be the center of attention but a sandwich with no cheese, tomatoes or lettuce just isn't a sandwich at all. Layers of meat, a tiny splat of mustard and soft thin bread? C'mon. The lines are long for that?? The bread could've at least been toasted, give me a little more mustard and throw some lettuce on that bad boy cuz otherwise it was dry as hell no matter how juicy the meat was. 

If you must try it to know for yourself, skip the dine in line and go straight to the take out spot. There's some standing room space in the back or go across the street where there's outdoor seating. Do you really ~need~ to dine in for a sandwich and fries?"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you'd expect. Yes it's touristy, but for a good reason. Come here for one thing, the amazing smoked meat sandwich. I don't see why people are complaining about a $10 sandwich... this is a perfectly reasonable price for the big pile of meat you get between the bread. Come early or late to avoid the crowds as this place gets packed. The fries were fine, but I wish I had gotten some pickles instead."}
{"text":"Unbeatable smoked meat.  An absolutely necessary stop during any Montreal trip. The medium fat is so juicy and delicious. And if you're feeling guilty, the lean is really tasty too. The meat speaks for itself and doesn't need much more other than mustard and rye bread (or just eat it by the forkful). Easily better than any fake Montreal smoked meat places (outside of Montreal) and beats all the Montreal places too."}
{"text":"My husband, who is a Cleveland native and fan of that city's wonderful Romanian deli, Corky and Lenny's, had high hopes for Schwartz's.  Though there was a line when we arrived, it moved quickly, and we shared a table with two other customers with no appreciable wait.  Our waiter was efficient and good-natured--no small feat given the hordes of people moving through there at all hours.

We got smoked meat sandwiches (medium-fat, following advice from just about everyone) with a pickle, cole slaw and fries.  The pickle was great; the coleslaw was sweet and sour and vinegary, in a style I like and associate with Eastern European countries like Hungary and the Czech Republic.  The rye bread on the sandwiches was fresh and tasty with just enough caraway. I appreciated the portion size--generous but not crazy a la Carnegie Deli. So far, so good.  Not so good? The fries, which were greasy and not remotely crispy.

As for the meat, well, Zabar's in NYC wins for me (their spicing is a little more complex and the meat is moister), and my husband maintains his loyalty to his favorite Cleveland smoked meat.  It's worth mentioning that what constitutes \"medium-fat\" is really the luck of the knife and which end of the meat your portion happens to come from.  My husband's sandwich had several pieces that were entirely fat, which felt a little excessive to both of us.  My sandwich was leaner, and in our opinion, tastier as a result. On the other hand, I do agree with others that ordering the sandwich \"lean\" would be a mistake--the meat is on the dry side already, and without a little fat along for the ride would lose much of its flavor. 

In short, Schwartz's for us was good but not great--definitely not up to the considerable hype.  If you've never encountered deli food before, it would be a fun experience, but for us, it just didn't hold up to the excellent deli sandwiches we've had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Véritable institution du smoked meat. Incontournable oui c'est sur. Pour qui veut du smoked meat bien sur. C'est simple, deux tranches de pain de seigle avec des tonnes de viandes fumées dedans le tout avec une tite moutarde. Alors ce n'est pas de la haute gastronomie certes, mais qui y va pour ça? J'ai testé plusieurs smoked meat mais ça reste ici le best :)"}
{"text":"It's good, but not excellent, and highly overrated. Not worth the usual wait, and a DANGER, MUST AVOID!!! on weekends. If you really want to try Schwartz's, go for early lunch (10:30 or 11 am) on a late night snack (after 10 pm) and ONLY go on weekdays, and/or in down season (not during the summer festival months.) Also, give places like Dunn's and Reuben's a try; they both do smoked meat in different and arguably better ways."}
{"text":"I never crave meat, but now that I'm back from Montrela for the summer, I am CRAVING a smoked meat sandwich from Schwartz's. This place is unbelievably. Smoked meat is a Montreal tradition and Schwartz's is the best. Super cheap for a delicious and filling meal. Get the medium cut and drown the sandwich in mustard. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I definitely didn't know what all the hype about this place was until last week ago! The guy working there even said he would return my money if I didn't love it so what did I have to lose?
and now I can proudly say that I AM A BELIEVER OF MONTREAL SMOKED MEAT! Meat is tender and not chewy like other smoked meat sandwiches :) It is on soft bread with the right amount of mustard.It is must eat in MTL"}
{"text":"I have no other words. I could come up with something clever and intelligent, but this place is simply the sh*t. I refuse to listen to the people who say all Montreal smoked meat is the same, or that Rubens is better. I'm open to change, if it's for the better. In this case, once you go Schwartz, you never go back.

I crave this place. 

When I fill this craving it satisfies the depths of my soul, not just my stomach. The perfect meal here is a medium sandwich, a side of fries, coleslaw, a pickle and a cherry coke. I hope you wrote that down. 

They opened a take-out store next door to help manage some of the traffic. The waiters at the dine-in restaurant are hilarious - they love to flirt, and provide a few laughs. 

I brought some back with me. It's what's for lunch...scratch that, I'm going to eat it now."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich after poutine?  Sure, why not, fatty!

And that was one fine $6.40 Smoked Meat Sandwich, despite being stuffed already.  Compared to its more famous cousin, pastrami, the flavorful, peppered meat was more tender and fell apart with each bite.  Gather the meaty bits with lots of mustard between two slices of rye, and enjoy.  (Fun Fact: Schwartz's cures the smoked meat everywhere - including in the ceiling of the restaurant.)  There wasn't a wait at 11PM, and upon suggestion from the friendly folks behind the counter, I added a $1.85 pickle on the side and washed it all down with Montreal's own Cott's Black Cherry Soda for $2.  Mazal tov!"}
{"text":"Iconic, they do what they do and it's all about the experience.  delicious, so glad I went before flying home from Montreal!"}
{"text":"A very similar setup to NYC's Katz's Deli. Pastrami sandwich (medium fat) was delicious. Long line moves quickly and worth it. Pickles were bleh."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today...no wait and quick service.. This was my first time eating a smoked meat sandwich and it was delicious, juicy, tender. Tried the coleslaw and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"I heard great things about Schwartz's before visiting Montreal, and perhaps I had too high expectations.

I had a smoked meat sandwich (of course). It was good, but not as good as something which seems to be a must when you visit Montreal. It was also quite pricey for the size.

If it were cheaper, and with less of a line I would surely go back. But I don't think it's something that fantastic as some people say."}
{"text":"Go for the take-out shop beside the dine-in spot, the sandwiches are the same and there's usually no line at all for take-out! It's a safe choice for a Montreal smoked meat sandwich, though nothing makes it stand out compared to others for me."}
{"text":"A Montreal must! Even if you don't eat meat, there are other options for the finicky diner. Not the most amazing sandwich I've ever had, in my opinion, but if you're gonna try Montreal smoked meat, definitely go to Shwartz. Service could be a bit more lighthearted, but at the same time understandable when you're serving hoards of hungry tourists waiting impatiently for a table. If you're in a hurry, check out the take out window located to the left."}
{"text":"Schwartz is unbelievable. I had a sandwich again on my way back to Toronto from Montreal and I was blown away all over again. It was almost as if it was the first time I ever ate it. I finished it and cursed myself that I didn't order another, or at least acquired a pound or two of smoked meat to return home with. I can't get over how good it is, I feel like I should be bending down on one knee and proposing my order. 

The meat is spiced and smoked perfectly. The bread is soft and chewy. The perfect amount of mustard is spread. The portion is solid for the price. With a sour pickle and black cherry soda, it could very well be in contention for my last meal. 

I do."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, it's a total tourist trap. But I've managed to avoid the brutally long lines out the door for some reason. 

Medium smoked meat sandwiches with fries and a pickle = Yum. Taking the order to go and heading to the park = Fun."}
{"text":"I came here while in town with my husband on our \"mini-moon\".  We took a food tour through Airbnb and this was one of the stops.  The sandwich was good but pretty standard.  The pickles are definitely worth trying as well.  Seems to be a Montreal staple so I definitely recommend giving this place a shot if you're visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"As far as smoke meat goes this place was incredible and lived up to it's 80 some odd years of quality. Great coleslaw!"}
{"text":"I went early morning with the family on a short stay ! I found everyone very nice I had the waiter telling me jokes 
The food was great 
Good family time and meal"}
{"text":"My husband and I got in late, so we wound up going to a deli close to our hotel for dinner. He'd heard a lot about Montreal smoked meat sandwiches, and so ordered one. He thought it was good, but nothing special - he didn't see what all the fuss was about.

So we made a point of going here, which everyone told us was the best in the city, and it didn't disappoint - the difference was striking. We split the large plate  (medium), which was enormous, even for two large guys. The smoked meat sandwiches we saw people order all contained generous, evenly cut slices of meat. On the large plate those even slices were supplemented by a pantheon of smaller bits which have been caramelized by the roasting process until they are toothy and crispy. Supplemented with a Cott Black Cherry Soda (which EVERYone in the place was having) and you have a perfect Montreal meal."}
{"text":"Born in Montreal and been living in Southern California for practically all my life but whenever I return to Montreal to visit family, I always, and I emphasize this, I always go to Schwartz the first night im there!  And I go as much as I can until the end of my trip.  It's the one place I can never forget how good the smoked meat is.  It's soo good that we have even overnighted 2 slabs of smoked meat all the way to LA.   

It's a tiny place that has a lot of history.  It's busy and the guys behind the counter are fast paced and know exactly what they are doing with the endless years of experience under their belt.

If you're a tourist from the States or any other place, I highly recommend making this a mandatory stop on places to eat in Montreal!

As I write this... I'm actually craving a smoked meat sandwich from them ... and it's torture...

This will forever be my favorite place in Montreal and it has been for close to 20 years!"}
{"text":"Being a native New Yorker,.. we have 2nd ave, Kat's, Carnegie deli... When I heard about Schwartz's, I had to go and compare... and you know what, I was pleasantly surprised... It's really damn good!

So at Kat's deli (my current NYC favorite)... the first thing you get is the pastrami on rye with mustard... at Schwartz's, you get the smoked meat on rye with mustard. We had the option of lean, medium, or fatty. To be on the safe side, we went with medium because the lean might be a bit dry... a decision I ended up regretting. Should have gone with fatty. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious. I just wish there was more fat on it... personal taste, not because there was something wrong with medium. 

The flavor of the smoked meat sandwich was not as salty as New York pastrami... a BIG plus for Schwartz's. And it's actually easily manageable. I have never EVER been able to eat a Kat's sandwich without it falling apart on me. Sure we get to pick at the pastrami after we're done, but the fact that its so salty... doesn't sit as well as a clean sandwich.

The only downside is that Schwartz's is not in New York. Schwartz's wins. Hands down.

PS: I HATE cole slaw... But I actually like Schwartz's cole slaw. It's just brined cabbage. No mayo."}
{"text":"The meat is very good, and they offer three different cuts: lean, medium, and fatty. The smell of the place is also very nice and smells like cancer, in a good way, just like their sandwiches. The only problem is the wait, which may take an hour or more depending on when you go, which is unfortunate and makes this place not worth it unless there's a shorter line."}
{"text":"Still the best smoked meat and deli food anywhere!  It is well worth the line up to get a table!"}
{"text":"First time here. Long wait but worth it. Food is very good. And the service was exceptional. The waiter helped us carry out our child's stroller and diaper bag. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I took the smoked meat sandwich, and I have to say, this place has not lived up to the hype. The meat was so-so, the bread was pretty underwhelming and the fries (as a side) were nothing special. The coleslaw, on the other hand, had a great flavor to it. Overall, not really worth the money if you're here for the smoked meat."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat sandwich in the world. Period. Very old school diner. You can skip the fries. But get the cherry cola."}
{"text":"Pour les touristes seulement.
Rien d'exceptionnel."}
{"text":"Is it the greasy floors or the overwhelming smell or the incredible foods? It is hard to tell what makes this place such a \"must-visit\" destination in Montreal. Come for the smoked meats and stay for the eccentric clientele on Sunday mornings :) It is a one trick pony but a very good one at that."}
{"text":"Avant, ils étaient vraiment très bon."}
{"text":"If you're a first timer in Montreal, this stop is a must even if it's just to say you've tried it. However, there are better places for subsequent visits with shorter lineups.

The lines are long, usually a 45min wait during peak hours and the seating area is crowded. It's definitely a go in, eat, get out, joint. There are three options for the sandwich: fatty (the juiciest), medium and lean. 

On this past visit, I got the fatty sandwich, the French fries, coleslaw, a dill pickle and a Colts cherry cola. The \"classic\" meal. It was a lot of food. The sandwich was meaty and the meat melted in my mouth. The fries were well cooked, and warm right out of the fryer. Everything else was simply mediocre, hence the ranking. 

If you're coming for the sandwich you won't be disappointed, they are consistent with the smoked meat. Everything else is a toss of the coin. This place is worth trying once, but with other places around with similar quality, once might be enough."}
{"text":"Big, juicy delicious sandwiches served without the fluff. We go every time we travel to Montreal. Definitely not the health conscious option. ;)"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of smoked meat, but everyone who has come here with me has LOVED the smoked meat sandwiches. IF you don't want to wait in line and don't mind taking to go - just walk go their takeout area (store on the left).

Recommendation: 110%."}
{"text":"The meat is so tender and juicy but the proportions are a little small. Can't really complain when the quality is this good. You need to at least give it a shot you won't be disappointed when visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"I came to Schwartz's based on all the fantastic reviews. I ordered the smoked meat sandwich which was good (compared to others that I've had), BUT it was $14 CDN for a sandwich and a drink. Too expensive for a tiny sandwich. Yes, it's a lot of meat but both me and my boyfriend were still hungry after we each ate one ourselves. If I added a pickle and fries it would have been over $20 CDN. The meat was tender and fell apart instantly, but there was no real flavour and I definitely needed more mustard. 

Overall, it was okay, but I don't think I would come back though."}
{"text":"best smoke meat.... end of story!"}
{"text":"Un classique à Montréal ! La viande fumé chez schwartz est excellente ! En plus , ils s'adaptent a la demande des gens sur le type de viande (mi-gras ou maigre) 

Cest une experience à faire au moins une fois dans sa vie !"}
{"text":"Ate: Smoked meat sandwich, liver and hot peppers

Drank: We skipped the cherry cola because it looked too sweet and artificial.

Liked: Got there on a rainy day so we got seated immediately.  Waiter was friendly and helpful.

Disliked: Smallish quantity, but we made sure to order enough.

Chicken: Not that kind of place.

Would mom like it?: Mom would pepper the waiter with too many questions, and in the end she would say that she doesn't know what all the fuss is about.

Would I go back: I've been back twice, not sure if I'd go back next time I'm in Montreal.

Recommend: I think everyone got the \"medium fat\""}
{"text":"The food is good. No question about that. But, it is also extremely expensive . 3 medium sized smoked meat sandwiches and a coke ended up costing me 46 dollars . I can go somewhere else and get the same thing for 20 dollars . They are are taking advantage of people who are spellbound by the name ."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich was amazing. They have two places side-by-side: one for eat-in and the other for only takeout. During the day, the lineup for the eat-in was really long and went down the sidewalk. So, I just went for take-out.

When it was finally my turn to order, I asked for a turkey sandwich, but the man convinced me to get the smoked meat sandwich, because he said anything other than the smoked meat was just processed meat. I did not regret his advice.

Come here for smoked meat, not the processed stuff!"}
{"text":"Do this once.  Go get the smoked meat sandwich and make sure you order a pickle.  

It is really really good and really cheap.  I split the large platter with my sister and that was sufficient for both of us with some food left when were done.

That being said, i feel like having done it once I don't really need to do it again."}
{"text":"Es war soooooooo lecker! Erst wundert man sich etwas über den kleinen unscheinbaren Laden. Ich hatte das smoked beef sandwich mit etwas fett. Es war super lecker, kam schnell, die Bedienung war sehr freundlich. Alles in allem hat es sich gelohnt. Abgesehen davon gehört das Restaurant Celine Dion und gehört, so wurde es mir gesagt, zu einem Must Do in Montreal. Ca 9 CAD habe ich für mein Sandwich bezahlt."}
{"text":"Worth trying if you are a visitor. 
The smoked meat was tasty with mustard. 
Portion wasn't too big.
Very fast serving. 
Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"A new co-worker was in town and wanted to try the best smoke meat around...  Of course Schwartz's was the first name that came to my mind.  I haven't been there in the last few years, but, as usual, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food.

You have to be ready to wait 30 minutes is you get there at lunch time (and that was only for take out...  Not taking about the dining room).

Great sandwich, great pickle... If you have to have one of these sandwich, order a medium cut or don't go!"}
{"text":"Really good smoked meat, tender & tasty. Goes well with coleslaw.
Quick in & out meal.  Thumbs up so much!"}
{"text":"It's just OK - tourist trap not worth the wait.  Try Lester's Deli.
Actually meat is kinda dry."}
{"text":"I was told that this place is a MUST TRY so I added it to my itinerary.  I showed up to find an apparently famous out the door lineup.  I figured that if any place has a line up out the door when it's -24 with the windchill, it had to be good!! I was not disappointed.

I only waited in the line up for about 10-15 minutes. The way they have arranged their seating meant that the waiting isn't necessary going to be long and it reminded me of a school's lunch room where long tables were lined up all the way to the back and you were squeezed into any available chair. Although not ideal, this layout got the job done of getting you in and fed a lot faster.

The menu had several different items listed; like chicken/turkey sandwiches, steak, etc. but while I was there I didn't witness a single person consuming anything but the smoked meat sandwich this place was well known for.

The sandwich was definitely mouth watering good and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.  I had also ordered a side of fries and a pickle which went great with the sandwich.  I left Schwartz with half a pound of their smoked meat spices combo and a chunk of meat from next door (take out section).  They accept plastic (debit/CCs) only in their take out section and only if you spend over $12, whereas it's only cash in the diner side.

If anyone knows of a place that is remotely similar to Schwartz's in Toronto (GTA), I would love to know about it."}
{"text":"Delicious meat! Wow!! Coming from New York,  I have tried brisket many times.  Usually,  it's been pickled.  But this smoked meat is outrageous  You can truly  taste  the flavor of the meat.  Yummy! !  No frills, but delicious"}
{"text":"10$ for the tiniest sandwich I've ever bought. Dry smoked meat, cold employees, ridiculous price, disgusting inside. Go to the main across or Dunns or jarry anywhere but here. I guess as a montrealer we have to try this once in your life but I'll never go back. So over rated."}
{"text":"great! this was a genuine jewish deli experience, prices were very reasonable (way cheaper than any smoked meat sandwich in NYC) and the staff were so friendly! there was barely a wait and we were waiting outside for less than 2 minutes. 
the sandwiches are such a steal at $6.50...soooo gooood. i ordered olives on the side but the coleslaw looked really really crisp and delicious. i would definitely recommend that. 

CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I may become Jewish simply because of smoked meat.  How they can make beef brisket so unbelievably tasty is beyond me.  It was my second then quickly my third time to Schwartz's last time to Montreal.  I was dying to try the turkey but I couldn't stray from the smoked meat sandwich.  Down and dirty...mild rye, yellow mustard and MEAT.  I want it right now!!!  FYI:  you can order your meat lean or at least medium also.  I just asked for normal which was medium (when in Rome).  Some servers aren't too nice others are way nice, you never know.  I thought it was the best late night or hangover meal (which was my first time there)  I most definitely recommend it sober and rested, your brain/stomach will appreciate the flavors more!  I wish they had ice and better drink selection also, I wish they didn't charge for pickles or peppers.  FYI:  cash only and go at off meal hours for no wait.  2 blocks over parallel with St. Laurent you can find free street parking.  Someone posted about cleanliness...it is true its not the cleanest place in town but there's a line for a reason."}
{"text":"A Montréal landmark!

Usually, with a line going up and/or down and around the block... if you love smoked meat, you'll wait! 

Don't forget to request a big, fat, juicy pickle! :D"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Schwartz. They have one of the best smoked meat sandwiches in this world. The meat is stacked so high that you will have a hard enough time just biting into it. I would recommend it to anyone who loves deli meat and wants to eat at one of the most popular places in Montreal. 
Be willing to wait in line for a long time, not much you can do about this. 
Be willing to sit with people you don't know and ignore some of the late night drunks.
If you order packaged meat, it is going to expensive but the quality and taste is worth it. 
It is cash only.

One thing that a lot of people do not know is that Schwartz was recently purchased in 2010 by Céline Dion and her husband.   

Some of the issues I have with Schwartz's is that when you go to pay, the cashier does not care if she wastes your time standing there and talking to other employees and customers. I have also had a few experiences when the night staff is extremely rude and unfriendly.

If you love Schwartz, I would recommend you also try The Main and Snowdon Deli."}
{"text":"This place is probably the one stop almost every tourist must make when visiting Montreal.  It's world famous and everyone you know will tell you this is the best place for smoked meat in the universe.  This is the case for most people, but here's why I don't feel this way.

The line ups here are insane, and when you're able to get a seat you're placed in a shoulder to shoulder bench with about 10 other people.  The line ups typically on a busy day range from 15 minutes to 45 minutes, but can get much worse during tourist season.  I used to come by after work on a weekday and it's not too bad, if you're craving it.

The food is good, but the smoked meat to me has it's off days.  It's not as consistent as the Main, and to be honest not worth the wait for me.  If there isn't a wait I don't mind getting a sandwich and pickle, but my usual go to is the Main across the street."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is delicious. The smoked meat is so tasty you can taste it for hours after you've eaten it. Order a cherry coke with it, it's the best combination there is.

Be aware that in spite of the Jewy name, Schwartz doesn't serve kosher smoked meat. I believe Reuben's deli does, but don't take my word for it.

My only criticism about Schwartz's is the fact that it's the epitome of a cash cow. There is no decor or ambience whatsoever, the management doesn't care, and they aren't about to do anything about it. The place is constantly packed, there's a lineup in the middle of winter, it's actually a fairly unpleasant affair.

That said, I honestly can't tell the difference between the smoked meat here and at Rueben's deli on st cath. I really appreciate Reuben's atmosphere, it's a very comfortable place to eat, and they offer the same food.

When all is said and done, Schwartz is a famous, historic joint. You eat there because everyone has eaten there. Because you're a good goy that does what you're told.

Well, my favorite smoked meat joint is Reuben's because they even make an effort to make their restaurant comfortable for their customers, so eat your heart out, Schwartz's, you phony non-kosher profiteers!"}
{"text":"Delicious pastrami! A small sandwich hits the sweet spot, not to mention the delicious fries that goes with it!"}
{"text":"Awesome smoked meat but ridiculously long lineup. I bought a pack of smoked meat to go and had it at home with some rye bread, Swiss cheese, pickles and spicy mustard, and I'd say it was just as good as being there."}
{"text":"It's a tourist trap yes, but that doesn't mean they have the right to treat tourists like shit because they know they'll never see them again.  The only thing that will force them to treat people remotely civilly is if tourists start boycotting this place.  

Tourists (and Montrealers) have some self-respect and stop going! It's just a sandwich and it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"If i gives Katz in New York 5 stars, i would give Main Deli (cross street from Schwartz's) 4 stars, and Schwartz's would be 3 stars.  we bought one medium smoked meat sandwich from Main and one from Schwartz's.  Schwartz's maybe the oldest smoked meat sandwich place in town, but Main Deli's sandwich is better.  it's more juicy and tasty.  if you don't believe me, you should compare them yourself!"}
{"text":"I feel awful about giving such an institution a less than amazing review but their standards have really fallen in the past few years. You're still in for a pretty tasty and delicious sandwich but it's missing all the love and some of the flavour that made it so famous in the first place. I hope they get their mojo back soon!"}
{"text":"I think if you're to go to any restaurant in Montreal to get a taste of the city you need to go to Schwartz's. I remember coming here a while back during the day time and having a fantasticly huge smoked meat sandwich. Thankfully, one of the best things about Schwartz's is that you can get yourself one of these bad boys at pretty much any time of day. So when I needed my midnight snack I knew I had to come here. 

Ok first of all I don't even like smoked meat. Except here, of course. Anywhere else I can't do it. So I ordered 2 medium smoked meat sandwiches, 2 turkey sandwiches and 2 half sours. Sadly they were out of half sours so I ordered a regular pickle.Despite there being a line (even at 12AM), the service was polite and efficient. Just a reminder, these guys are cash only, but theres an ATM in the back. For the 4 sandwiches+pickle it came to $36, pricey I guess, but totally worth it. I realized I forgot my cherry coke on the way out which was plain silly.

The meat was a bit dry. It wasn't moist and delicious like the first time I had it, perhaps because it was at night? Perhaps there was more fat on it the first time? Either way, it was still so huge it was nearly impossible to eat, and the amazing spices were all there so it still tasted great.  The pickle was also great, if you haven't had a pickle that isn't from a jar you bought at the grocery store, you need to. I don't know why they're so much better but they are. The turkey was also exceptionally good, but it was a cold cut, still it was seasoned wonderfully and also nearly impossible to eat like the smoked meat one. Also they threw in a few extra pickles for me! Yay

-1 point for the meat being dry. I'm sure it was an isolated incident ! :) Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"If you are into Smoked Meats then this is the place to go to. I don't think its a tourist trap, its more of a landmark..... which has been serving food for ages, and they do it justice. Prices are fair I find and the place could be nicer, but overall a great Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal Canada for a Tattoo Convention. One of my colleague GF went to college in montreal and recommended all these places to eat and Schwartz was one of them. 

His GF kept telling us to eat at Schwartz and that we had to get Smoked Meat sandwich. Arriving to the hotel at 12am, we were both tired of Flying All Day and Starving and looking for something to eat.

We then went to a 24 Hour Cafe. They also had the smoked meat, the picture looked great. So we both decided to get the Smoked meat.

When we ate it, we thought it was good enough to check off our list of things to eat in Montreal.  We were wrong, Wait till you get to Schwartz, it is well worth the wait. Also dont forget to get the Black Cherry Soda. 

This place seems like a guys place because when they serve the food all they give you is a plate of MEAT, SLICED BREAD, PICKLES & MUSTARD.  You know what, that is all you need.

What was funny was that my neighbor grew up in Montreal and when I came back he told me that i must go to Schwartz.. Sorry beat you too it."}
{"text":"I came here thinking that this was a wannabe New York Deli.  Boy was I wrong.  This restaurant made such an impact in the city of Montreal that they even created a stage play based on the restaurant itself.  Despite the acclaim, it kept its \"hole in the wall\" appearance.  Their specialty here is the smoked beef.  Their very tender slices of smoked beef melt in your mouth between two very basic slices of bread and mustard.  I also ordered their steak, which was cooked with a delicious pepper marinade.  Not to mention their french fries were crispy and amazing!  

It gets packed in there sometimes so don't be surprised to sit with strangers at the same table while enjoying your meal.  Our waiter was very kind and helpful.

I was thoroughly impressed with the food (the obvious main highlight in this establishment).  I hope to come to Montreal again sometime and enjoy this amazing spot."}
{"text":"Honestly is very important especially when it. Comes to food.

The fine folks at this establishment get 5stars not just for the taste of their food, but for truth.

Walked in I was going for the smoked meat sandwich while my friend was going for a turkey sandwich. The crew stated the turkey meat was nothing special, just typical deli meat. So ordered two of the smoked sandwiches (around the same price anyway) and that was money well spent.

Lordy the flavor, so damn good. We ate our sandwiches at Tam-Tam park... Good time indeed."}
{"text":"Having been to New York many times and having a proper deli sandwich, I expected a lot from the reviews and line outside. The line moves fast so don't be afraid. Bring cash as it is cash only and don't use USD. Ordered the smoked meat sandwich. Two things. It's 1/4 the size of a Carnegie Deli sandwich so order your own, don't share. Ask for it deconstructed so you can control the meat, mustard and bread ratio. Order the pickle and coleslaw on the side. Black cherry coke is only good if you like sugary artificial sweet drinks, order a ginger ale instead. Def order the poutine fries. Yummy cheese curds and rich gravy. Yum! Best fish here actually."}
{"text":"An establishment you're obligated to go to when you visit Montreal, but one that rewards you with delicious meat.

The hot sandwiches you are looking for are available at 1030. We were turned away because we arrived too early and when we came back a little past 1030 the place was already packed. We didn't wait at all to be seated and our sandwiches appeared in the blink of an eye. I could see this place having a long line throughout the day but these guys know what they are doing and everyone gets their food in a timely manner. Obviously the to go line moves along much quickly than if you were waiting for a seat.

It could get cramped in there but the interior is clean and if you go in making it a your business to eat and then leave without dallying you'll be fine.

At this time the smoked meat sandwiches are $9.60. It's simplicity of expertly smoked meat with mustard on rye bread allows you to appreciate the excellent minutiae of consuming a perfectly well made product. 
I wasn't able to finish my sandwich so they kindly gave me a to go bag. 
While you're in the area stop by La Vieille Europe a few stores down the street. It's a grocery store that have so many food items unique to Europe. It's a must for foodies. 
Cash Only.
Go there. Just Go."}
{"text":"Its Schwartz..... you can't go wrong! But I'm no longer a lineups person... so I would steer clear from peak times. Otherwise,,, get ready for some mouthwatering meat!"}
{"text":"It was a very delightful experience to go to Schwartz for the first time this weekend ! The food was amazing, really the ambiance and the people working there really show a lot of empathy to clients."}
{"text":"Came here for smoked meat on my trip to Montreal. Full confession, Schwartz has been tradition among my family as long as I can remember so there may be a bit of bias here. As far as I can tell it's the best smoked meat i have had and the quality is always high. 

I also usually go to the take out window. Usually the family is taking a big order back to Ottawa and we have to grab sandwiches for the road. It cuts down on the legendary line and hilariously brisk service. 

This time my girlfriend and I grabbed sandwiches along with two pickles and some potato salad and ate it in the shadow of Mount Royal. Perfect day."}
{"text":"At schwartzs, a huge pile of smoke dmeat is presented to me.  Dry, like the fresh light rye bread that tries desperately yo hold the meat pile together, and deli mustard generally spread upon the bread.

The meat is littered with black peppercorns, but the peppercorns are not too strong as to distract from the meat that has been cooked for hours.  The sandwich is filling. Noms.

Schwartz's has nothing to hide; simply pure good meat. 

Pure ingredients, and pride of tradition that has been round since 1928.

And a black cherry soda with your meat rocks. 

Noms. Oms. Oms.

{"text":"I normally get Montreal smoked meat when my brother comes back to Toronto. He gets the smoked meat just before he leaves and it's almost always dry and under salted. Obviously the fresh hot smoked meat is the best, but I don't live in Montreal. 

But now Schwartz have came up with a solution - vaccum sealed packaging. I love it! I don't know if it's a new idea. Of course it's still not as good as eating it Montreal, but it's a vast improvement from before. Well done."}
{"text":"It's a Montreal institution. I have been to Schwartz's three times so far, which is every single time I have been to Montreal. 

The smoked meat sandwich looks small when it comes out but the THICK stack of meat really fills you up. Medium fattiness is the best because it makes the sandwich just a bit juicy without going overboard on the fat.

The servers were trying hard to chat up some college girls at the table next to us to the tune of \"wow... we hardly get to see girls here!\" so that was amusing."}
{"text":"Nice place to buy smoke meat. The meat is not very salty. Popular place at Montreal. The service is kind of traditional, and only accept cash, so better get prepared."}
{"text":"Taking a short trip through Montreal and obviously had to stop at the ORIGINAL smoked meat place! 
The waiters were super friendly and seated us surprisingly quickly in such a crowded restaurant. Didn't need a word of French in here to communicate :D. The guests next to us were locals and were super friendly and had recommended a few things. The place is definitely very lively and more for the young, starving student crowd as opposed to a family oriented restaurant. 
And the FOOD. SOOOO GOOD. Got the obvious choice of smoked meat sandwich. The meat was sooo tender and just melted in your mouth. The little bit of fat actually gave a great texture to the meat. 
There are reviews saying Schwartz has become a 'tourist trap', but I certainly beg to differ. Definitely recommended if you're ever in beautiful Montreal!"}
{"text":"Get the fatty!  Delicious smoked meat sandwich! Great service.  There was a line out the door but it moved rather quickly.  Only downside is that you share tables with others which was different for me."}
{"text":"I don't go here often cause of the long lines and um, up-close-and-personal seating, but on the rare occasion that I do, it has always been a treat. Schwartz's is renowned for a reason, their smoked meat is definitely top notch. You can even order it less or more fatty (varies depending on my mood). Add some fries and a black cherry soda with that and you are set for life."}
{"text":"Don't forget to ask for pickles!"}
{"text":"Schwartz is an old style Jewish Deli  but with a Montreal touch. The specialty of the house is their \"Smoked Meat\" sandwich. Similar to corned beef but not quite the same. Seems to me the spices are a cross between corned beef and pastrami. The sandwiches are hand cut and served on rye bread with fries, pickles & cole slaw. Reminds me of Katz deli in New York's lower east side but better. . Unique experience & excellent food. Definitely worth going to if in Montreal."}
{"text":"Sandwich was like a fatty, moist and delicious brisket sandwich but with Montreal smoked meat flair. Take out line had 5 minute wait, so recommend that. Smoked meat poutine had a pile of smoked meat so was a great accompaniment."}
{"text":"We were in Montreal and the hubs wanted to try the famous Schwartz's. The line was out the door, but we waited about 30 minutes before getting a seat. I left my vegetarian diet outside and tried a bite. It was really an awesome sandwich. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"My second time visiting this awesome place did not disappoint. There's usually a line outside but we got in fast because it was only my girlfriend and I and there were two sits at the bar. Jaime, was our server, and he was great. It was fun to speak Spanish with him even though I know I should be practicing my French. We order the specialty of the house: smoked meat sandwich, pickles, fries, and black cherry soda. 10 out of 10!!! Everything came fast and it was delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Montreal since the late 90's and never had a smoked meat sandwich. Well when the hubbs wanted to come up to watch our Mets take in the Blue Jays at Stade Olympique I made it a point to come here for dinner. 
I do have to say Jewish Deli is my #1 favorite type of food. The reason for this has to come from my Grandmothers next door neighbor who IMHO made the best sour dill pickles EVER!!!!  But I digress, but will get to their pickles in a bit. 
Let me start off with the place. We get there and it is tiny with maybe 8 tables I could see that were chocked full of people. Also facing the food was a bar that had stools you could sit at. When we got there (9 on a Saturday night) the only two places to sit were at the bar which were fine by us.
Now as I have said before I love Deli food so when it comes to the meat I am a little picky.  I do prefer a more fatty cut of meat and they deliver. You have your choice of three levels of fattiness which is a nice option as not everyone enjoys the fatty part of brisket. 
The fries are amazing as they are whole potatoes that look like they are cut in house. An order is large enough to split although I tried valiantly to not hog them all but failed miserably. 
Ok now the star of the meal for me was the pickles. They were so good that I let the husband have the rest of the fries so that I could have his pickle. Putter is the brand name of them and I really wish that they had them on this side of the border."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat sandos. Absolutely worth the trip to come and eat. We were here during passover so I can't comment on how the bread is...I just got a pile of meat, which was delicious."}
{"text":"This place was one of our first stops in Montreal.  It's cash only and, for the price, it's bomb!  You can choose your fattiness level.  We got the medium fatty and the fatty sandwiches and I recommend the fatty, but I'm not the healthiest foodie.  Also, don't call it pastrami!"}
{"text":"Really overrated, it wasn't that great. And we found a cockroach on the table! I think Dunn's is way better."}
{"text":"Delicious smoked beef.  I bought 2lb SB and a jar of mustard for Christmas present for my brother in law who is a Jewish :P.  He liked it, I like it 

It is really small place with lots of people in.  Very authentic! - Nobody smiles when they serve you :) .  They don't like you to stand too close to door even though I had to order to the guy just right next to the door.  What do you want me to do?  

Well, I will buy the smoked beef here for togo but probably would eat at the main for better seats and services."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said already? Schwartz's Deli is a venerable institution in Montreal, and it is all about smoked meat. Similar to New York style hot pastrami (not that shaved crap you get in most delis), but not as salty. Just full of rich, smoked flavor, perfect with some deli mustard and bread, and served in Montreal at Schwartz's since 1928. They must be doing something right!

There are other things on the menu here, of course, but I would pass on any other meats. I also had a grilled steak, and it paled in comparison. The usual accoutrements are available, including fries and cole slaw. 

But be prepared. This place is quite small and most of the time, packed to the rafters. At usual meal times, getting in here can be a contact sport. But it is organized chaos. The guys in here have been directing traffic here for a while (one of the newest team members has been there 8 years), so they will eventually take care of you.

And as a bonus to American visitors, they accept US$ (currently at par).

Definitely one of the best treats you should afford yourself in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The best smoked meat in mtl but the experience is like get ur sandwich, wolf it down and gtfo 

If there is a huge line then just walk across the street to main deli since you pretty much get the same thing"}
{"text":"Amazing Smoked Meat. Overall it was very good and I'll go back. I tend to be a bitch about my Smoked Meat Sandwiches. I am the same way about my pizza, but we'll get to that another time.

We arrived right at 11 am so it was easy to get a table but the place filled up quickly.

Service was sort of Meh, which is part of the reason I took off a star. But also, I found the place to be super cramped. In order to eat a sandwich this stuffed with meat, you need a little extra elbow room. Also, I wished they had hot mustard and saurkraut on the sandwich. I guess I would have been happier if I had brought the meat home and made a sandwich there, myself. 

Kitchy, Iconic, Yum."}
{"text":"I feel like writing a review for an iconic location like Schwartz's is kind of useless because soooo many people have written a review, but there's one important reason for me writing today.

It's because something has happened to Schwartz's and it seems to be going down in quality. Now let me be clear, the place is still pretty darn good but it's not what it was many years ago. More importantly, if this trend continues, then this iconic Montreal shop which helped make Montreal Smoked Meat world famous will become a story for the history books rather than a place to visit in the now.

I hope things pick up again."}
{"text":"There's no doubt that you're going to get a good sandwich at Schwartz's but for me, it's just not worth the long wait and crowded space. 

The sandwiches are very large and satisfying and you must try them at least once but be prepared to wait...and wait...and....ohmygodi'msohungry...wait."}
{"text":"I was here two years ago and I'm just now reviewing it...maybe it's because I'm craving it. :( I love your sandwiches, Schwartz!!! do you love me, too?? lol jk 

I've had one of the best sandwiches of my life here. Their smoked meat is so flavor ful and you don't need any fancy dressing to top it off...just mustard! and a pickle is the perfect side. Wont somebody be so kind and mail me a sandwich to Dallas, Texas :) Sil vous plait!!!!"}
{"text":"I am sure this place is as great as everyone raves about, but when you're hungry and want a meal, like yesterday, a line out the door with several people giving you the hairy eyeball while waiting in line just won't cut it!   :-(  Gheeesh!  We weren't trying to line jump, just wondering where the line ended??  No smoked meats for us! Hopefully, we will get a chance to try this out while we are in town this week."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday at around 10:30. There was no line and there were a lot of empty seats inside. We ordered two smoked meat sandwiches which can be ordered fatty, medium or lean. We both got the medium. It was good, tender, tasty. Next time i might try the fatty. After we ate there was a line outside. It pays to be early. Would i go back? Hmmm maybe after trying reubens or others for comparison."}
{"text":"Get the smoked meat sandwich, obvs. It is truly delicious and you will not regret it. In fact, you will want 8 more smoked meat sandwiches immediately. You should get those, too.

My only complaint here is that they don't take credit cards...whatever, you're old school or something, I get it, you do you. They do have an ATM but...for some reason it doesn't work with American debit cards? Like what the heck? This is obviously a tourist haven so why do you insist on forcing American customers to go next door and use somebody else's ATM to get cash for your restaurant?

Okay, it was worth it for that smoked meat, but still, get your ATM in order."}
{"text":"My friends and i were on road-trip to Montreal from New York over the 4th of July 2010. I did most of planning for attractions and foods. I researched lots of different travel blogs and pages - they all seem to recommend this as must-try in Montreal. QC, so we decided to take online words.

Inside is nothing special. Just an ordinary deli shop with small tables here and there. I remember reading that 'smoked' sandwich is the way to go and never EVER get the lean version. I decided to roll my dice and try the fat sandwich with fries.

The foods quickly came and I was genuinely pleased with the size and taste of the sandwich. I now see why people come here and recommend this place for must-try in Montreal. However, I didn't think it was all that spectacular. In fact, there are many deli shops just like Schwartz in United States that offer very similar sandwiches if not match the taste. Schwartz may have the history and all the fame in Montreal but it's not the best sandwich I ever had in my lifespan. 

The service was adequate. Nothing great but not lazy either. We didn't ask for much, so the server didn't bother us many times. He already knew we were out of staters not knowing what we're eating, so probably just didn't care much for us.

The price wasn't friendly either. I'm sure the management team hiked the price just for the fame part, but I didn't think it was worth the price we paid for. My meal, which was a sandwich, fries, and drinks were well over $10 CAD. I believe a place like this shouldn't go over $10 for a combo meal.

Although my review may sound little harsh, I did enjoy the sandwich. We got there early for lunch. As we were walking out of restaurant, we noticed a line of 30 or some people outside -- thus explains the fame of this restaurant and Canadians must really love this place for lunch. The restaurant is located in heart of Montreal, St. Laurent Blvd so it's nice to walk around and grab a quick bite if you're not in hurry. Nonetheless, I do recommend this place if you're a visitor from out of country."}
{"text":"I got two favourite smoked meat places to go to in Montreal now.  Schwartz's has long been heralded and revered as the go to place in Montreal for smoked meat and after waiting in the long lineup Sunday morning just to get a seat at this busy establishment I was not disappointed.  Ordered myself the smoked meat sandwich with a Cott's Black Cherry soda (where can I get this in Ontario?) and the meat was nice, juicy and tender.  Montreal smoked meat is a staple for all visitors that come to the city, I have tried many in the city as well and this is one of the best."}
{"text":"WOW.  LOVE!

They are everything it's hyped up to be and then some.  It's not easy getting there but it was well worth the effort.  Luckily, we got there late afternoon and there was not a line.  

When you order your sandwich, they'll ask if you want fat or lean.  Go with the fat, my friends and thank me later.  You'll be a fool to have the lean option.  

We grabbed a seat at a table and our sandwiches came shortly.  The sandwich is regular size but the mountain of meat was overwhelming!   The meat was so tender and flavorful.  Honestly, I knew there was no way I can even finish half and I can eat!  Our waiter, George, an old timer there came over and threatened (teased) me that I will not be allowed to leave if I don't finish my sandwich.  He's so nice, just like a grandpa and just couldn't resist taking a pic with him - not to mention he has a great name!

The price is so affordable.  If we must choose between Schwartz's or Kat's, it will be Schwartz's."}
{"text":"Montreal's legendary smoked meat spot is tiny and picturesque.  I was a little underwhelmed by the sandwich after all the hype, but the real downer were the greasy, limp fries.  We had a short wait to get in; is it worth an hour wait?  You decide.  Cash only."}
{"text":"We have to wait a lot of time .The place smell bad, the tables are so close so this produces a lot of noise in the environment. The food is not worth it to many disadvantages"}
{"text":"I went in with high expectations since this place is a Montreal institution, and of course I ordered the Smoked Meat Sandwich since it's what they are known for. I really wanted to like this place but it just fell short. 

Overall, the sandwich was just okay. Luckily I did not wait long to get seated, however, if the line were any longer I'd say it wouldn't be worth it. The flavor of the smoked meat was very tasty, it's less peppery than the American pastrami and more mild, which I liked. My one complaint about the meat is that it was sliced too thick which made it tougher to eat (I prefer thin sliced). The bread was pretty standard and a little too soft because it fell apart easily as I bit into the sandwich. I also highly recommend that you order the dill pickle or coleslaw (which is vinegar based) to accompany your sandwich to cut through the fattiness of the meat.

The highlight of our meal was the fast, efficient, and friendly service. Make sure you bring plenty of Canadian currency because this place is CASH ONLY. They will let you use American currency but you will be charged extra. I'm glad I got the chance to check this place out......but I probably will not be going back for more."}
{"text":"I really don't have much to add, but the smoked meat sandwiches are delicious. 

1. There is always a line- so just deal with it.

2. The servers for the most part understand English

3. The poutine is below average - so don't order it.

4. You are committing some sort of Quebecois sin if you don't order cherry soda with your meat. Ditto - getting a pickle. 

5. There are other options other than smoked meat- they serve seemingly delicious turkey, chicken and salami sandwiches as well. There is also liver- I am not going to vouch for that. 

6. Schwartz offers  take out for those disinclined to sit elbow to elbow at communal tables. Please note- when going this route- the folks in line with holler at you, and curse your existence as you skip by them in line. 

7. Schwartz IS tourist-y - but there usually enough drunk, local college students around, to make you feel slightly less lame."}
{"text":"I've had the brisket before in a sandwich and it was excellent.

I stopped by recently for some take out.  The guy at the counter told me that they only allow you to order take out of brisket if you order the entire thing, which is about 10-12 pounds.  That's too much brisket for me, so I settled for the smoked meat which they do allow take out by the pound.  Their smoked meat is excellent.

Service was prompt, although not necessarily friendly.   Then again, you're really just looking to get your meat and go - not make new friends."}
{"text":"Pretty good smoked meat sandwich if you like that sort of thing! It was a very simple menu and casual atmosphere. We grabbed a couple of the smoked meat sandwiches to go since we wanted to hit the road early and these were really clutch. The sandwich held up well despite being eaten a few hours after being prepared. The sandwich does have mustard on it, just in case you are not a fan. It was a little crowded, so you may have to wait for someone to get up in order to grab a seat, but that just goes with the charm of this place. I assume people are getting up and sitting down constantly so you wont have to wait too long to find a table."}
{"text":"I hate to post negative review but I find myself in a situation where I have to.

In my opinion, it is not worth it. Now, let me explain why. Schwartz's is a highly renowned and waiting for a seat is normal. I had to wait around 30 minutes before having a seat. I hate to say it, but the food was not worth the wait. I ordered a smoked meat sandwich with french fries and cherry coke and the food was nothing extraordinary. Also, the restaurant was cram with people: eating right next to a stranger is nothing unusual at Schwartz's. 

However, eating at Schwartz's is a must only for the experience."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! The sandwich here was SO delicious we got it again as take out on our way out of town. I'd skip the fries (which are fine, but nothing particularly special) and save room to savor the meat and the pickles!"}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable price. The meat was not overly smoky and the fries were perfect. My only complaint is the place is too small, they should really consider expanding."}
{"text":"Long wait for take-out an sit down. The fatty sandwich was really good. Kind of wish I asked for extra mustard but it was good without it too."}
{"text":"Been here in the past and ENJOYED their smoke meat but today I'm pretty sure I got FOOD POISONED by their smoke meat sandwich. Need to serve them very hot!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what all the hype was about until I came here. Ordered the most popular dish and was sold. Amazing and well worth the time. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Anthony Bourdain's montreal episode and had to try it while in town from NYC.  This place was cheap and delicious.  But I've had better sandwiches from similar places, ie. Langer's in Los Angeles.  The meat is comparable but Langer's is still much better.  Anyway, we came here on a wednesday summer afternoon and got seated right away."}
{"text":"Good smoked meat, that's all. Maybe it's been too hyped up. The meat isn't great comparing to others . If you don't want to wait too long in the queue, just head to the one across the street, it has just the same good smoked meat but nicer service and no lineup."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait in the long line that was 20 or so deep.  The meat is juicy and bursting with flavor.  Get it medium or fat (if you can spare the cholesterol).  Don't forget the cherry soda and pickle.  

Better than Katz imho, and a much better value."}
{"text":"We braved the wintry weather to visit this \"must eat\" place. Unfortunately, it was a let down. The meat has a nice smoked flavor but isn't really anything amazing. The rye bread is plain and the fries were very greasy and limp. Was hoping for better. Cash only."}
{"text":"This place was great!  The meat is not what I expected-- the montreal style smoked meat I'm used to eating from the grocery store always has a salty rind to it, but this was just savory.  An interesting combination with the bread, which is very, very chewy.  I wish I had a chance to alternate bites between the pickle and the sandwich.

I'd love to come back and try a fatty cut for the sandwich.  The meat is rich, and the fat is just so much richer!"}
{"text":"Always a line, and there's a reason.

Nothing beats it.  It tastes like corned beef cuz they use allspice berries, but it's smoked so it's more tender than regular deli-style corned beef.  It could benefit from better bread, knowledge that mustard automatically goes on the sandwich unless you ask for it without, and fries that aren't soggy.  otherwise, the meat can't be beat, and make sure you get one of those deliiiiicious sour pickles to go along with it.  yum!"}
{"text":"We made the pilgrimage to this well-known deli in the Plateau area.  I expected something along the lines of Carnegie Deli in New York City.  But, Schwartz's is not that expansive, more a hole in the wall with tight seating that's necessarily communal.  The menu is also limited, four sandwiches and half a dozen special plates like steak, liver and chicken plus a few side items.  They stick to what they do best and what they've been doing for years.

The star is the smoked meat sandwich, which is like a corned beef or pastrami and tender like brisket.  The meat spills out of the bread, all but making it disappear.  You'll eventually need a fork to eat up all that goodness.  We ordered ours with fries and a pickle, which is huge and very briny.  It's all delivered by a cast of colorful old timers who easily fall into humorous stories about the celebrity pictures covering the wall.  Since we arrived mid-afternoon, the legendary line was nonexistent.

The couple sharing our table, were regulars who came from an hour and a half away and remembered Schwartz's when it had sawdust floors.  Obviously, this is a deli with staying power and a Montreal institution you need to experience.

Oh, yes, cash only."}
{"text":"Stayed classic and got the smoked meat sandwich with mustard, coleslaw, and a pickle on the side. Shared a table with a couple from New Brunswick on my left, and one from Newfoundland to my right. As a Nova Scotian in the middle, we managed to have some lively conversation and enjoy the busyness of the space. This meal led to my discovery that pickles are actually cucumbers. Until that day, I always thought that they were their own special vegetable. Sigh..."}
{"text":"As everyone already commented, which probably doesn't need another reiteration, the smoked meat sandwich is worth getting :)"}
{"text":"While the line was long, we didn't have to wait very long since the turn lover is quite quick -- people moving in and out of the restaurant. 

It is quite squishy inside but we sat at the counter and ordered 2 Montreal Smoked Meat sandwiches which they gave us immediately. We were in and out within 10 minutes -- granted we were so hungry when we sat down so the sandwiches were basically engulfed within minutes. 

I have to agree that the sandwiches are good BUT there are definitely other places in Montreal that serve better smoked meat sandwiches. Others may disagree with me but I definitely would not return to Schwartz unless someone else wanted to try it. It's worth the try but if you've visited Montreal multiple times, there are other options out there to avoid the line and price. Each sandwich was around $10 and with two cans of pop our total for 2 people was $30 -- making this the most expensive meal we had in Montreal for the least amount of food. 

Overall, I would say it worth the try because it is quite good but it's not a must-go-to place for me."}
{"text":"Whether you live here or are visiting, Schwartz's has to be on the to-do list.  
There was a huge line-up for the restaurant so we went next door to the take out place.  Great choice.  Lots of fun inside and you get your order and move over to the stand up tables with high chairs.
We grabbed the medium sandwich.  Stuffed with buckets of smoked meat,  Tender and juicy.  We wanted to try the pickles as well.  There were 4 of us and on the recommendation of our 'host' behind the counter, he recommended we just get a jar.  Perfect.
The bread on the sandwiches was fresh so all around a perfect stop.  If you eat in the take out be sure to leave a note on your napkin on the big board.  Lots of fun messages there."}
{"text":"Classic Montreal food item. Don't forget to get the pickle with it and never say no mustard."}
{"text":"Just excellent - a must when visiting Montreal. The line is always out the door for a reason. Get the smoked meat sandwich and a pickle on the side and you're golden."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here during out visit to Montreal.  We came for lunch on a Saturday right when a line started forming.  Do not be discouraged by the line.  It moves fairly quickly and the wait is worth it.
The bf and I both got the smoked meat sandwich (this is what they are known for however they do have other options), pickles and slaw.  Everything was delicious.  The sandwich is very simple - meat and bread, both are very fresh and the meat is juicy and plentiful.

Tip: if you're a party of 1 or 2 opt-in for sitting at the bar in order to sit down faster."}
{"text":"So. Very. Crowded.
If you're the tiniest bit claustrophobic, don't even think about waiting in line to get into this place. I'm not, so I was perfectly fine. After a20-minute wait for my party of 5, we were ushered to the very back of the restaurant where we were told that Drake sat at the table in front of us once. We were also told that Celine Dion is part owner! Boy, does Montréal love Celine.

My group all got smoked meat sandwiches. I got coleslaw as my side and we shared fries and pickles. Well, A pickle. The thing was huge. The smoked meat is everything they say it is. Juicy, smoky, delicious. I put extra mustard on mine as I like the tang of it. The coleslaw was pretty good, too. Thinly sliced cabbage with a light, slightly sweet, vinegary dressing. I recommend it to cut the fat of the meat.

It's definitely touristy, and definitely worth it. Go."}
{"text":"Line up to sit down, take out was immediate. Took out the sandwich and poutine. Both amazing! Must eats in Montreal"}
{"text":"Good food, mediocre service but a true passion for the art of smoked meat. I  have been visiting for years. It's between good to great regarding quality and bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I like my sandwiches like how I like my women... smoked meat. Wait, I don't think I did that right. Walks like a pastrami sandwich, looks like a pastrami sandwich, but not a pastrami sandwich. That's not right either. Similar to NYC's old school delis, Schwartz's has been making sandwiches for close to 100 years. The formula is the same: salted meats piled high, mustard, and bread. Perhaps I went on an off day but half the smoked meat sandwich was too dry (lean?), and the other half was perfect (fatty). The friendly counter workers at this diner have the patience to deal with both tourists and locals."}
{"text":"Il faut manger là-bas si vous êtes à Montréal, c'est un incontournable dont la devanture et l'intérieur ne payent pas de mine mais l'habit ne fait pas le moine. Les prix sont abordables et la viande est une pure merveille, le tout avec un service irréprochable"}
{"text":"Un peu coûteux, victime de son succès, une grosse file d'attente mais ca vaut le détour"}
{"text":"It's only okay. It's a great experience to have because they are so well known but the sandwich itself is just okay. Fortunately, we did not wait AS long in line (probably due to the weather) but I have seen previous lines that are absolutely not worth it. 

The menu situation is very confusing because you don't get one. You need to look at the board behind the counter or the board at the very back of the restaurant. They are also cash only."}
{"text":"In the U.S., we call it Pastrami, but hey, if you wanna call it \"Smoked Meat\" that's fine, just don't call me \"Late for Dinner!\"

This place was out-of-this world delicious. I'm super glad we got there at an odd-moment where we were seated right away.

It seemed like the second we sat down, a giant line formed at the door that wrapped around the block. Apparently it's like this often.

Service is really slow but I think that's because they make these sandwiches with lots of love. Or at least, lots of smoked meat, and I guess that's hard to cut or something.

Either way, you sit communal and we were stuck next to a whiny couple who kept complaining that other people got their smoked meat even though they came in after the couple. They were whiny, but we were determined to stick through the inequitable service if we had to.

We split a small smoked meat sandwich with medium fat (you get to tell them lean, medium or Roseanne Bar circa 1980 level of fatness).  I thought the fattiness was perfect but my girlfriend wishes we went lean.

The rye bread is delcious, the cole slaw was tasty but overpriced and we ate every centimeter (I'm using metric cause we're in Canada) of the sandwich and then proceeded to lick our plates. 

The meat was delicious and super-seasoned, it's much dryer than the corned beef and pastrami I'd had in the states. I liked this but I understand others liking the moist stuff \"south of the border.\"  (that sounded really gross).

Anyway, I would definitely make Schwartz's a mut-do for myself whenever I'm in Montreal. I miss you, already, old friend."}
{"text":"I would really rate this place a 4.5 because there wasn't too much wrong. I went after midnight so there wasn't a line like everyone else experienced. There's a lot of hype around this place and it's well deserved. It's compared a lot to Katz's in NYC which I prefer. This smoked meat is super tender and a little fatty. Sandwich tastes great just wish there was a little more mustard. I would say it's a must while visiting the city"}
{"text":"The line was way too long to wait, but I got a delicious smoked meat sandwich to go.   Amazing.  It was like a cross between  pastrami and corned beef.  And the beef sticks were great."}
{"text":"What a tourist trap.

Listen, hey, if you haven't been to a good Jewish deli in your life, sure, maybe this place blows you away.  The smoked meat sandwich tastes good, but it's not the life changing experience travel blogs and reviews here make it out to be.  I've had way better.

Then, the service is curt because they want you in and out of there as fast as possible.  That's fine, I get it, but then you want a tip?  I get friendlier service at McDonald's.

But what really fries my latkes is their tax-evading, cash-only policy.  I don't like using cash, especially as an American tourist.  My entire trip, this was the only occasion where I couldn't use my credit card.  I didn't know they were cash-only until after I ate, so I had to use their ATM, which of course they charge a fee to use.  So not only did I get to pay them a fee to use their ATM, but then I was stuck with leftover Canadian Monopoly money."}
{"text":"When I think of smoked meat, I thought it would be dry, dry and dry. However, when I try the smoked meat at Schwartz's, I was amazed by how juicy and flavorful it can be. I am now a believer of the Schwartz's smoked meat, not sure if it is the best out there, but definitely the best I've tried. I was so excited to buy some for home back in Toronto, but it is not the same as having it there (although it is still good)! So for those of you that tried \"take-out\" and about to jump into conclusion, please be mindful that the take-out clearly does not justify! Tips: order the fatty part of the smoked meat; it might not sound like a healthy idea but definitely a good idea once you take a bite!"}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich and smoked meat poutine are tasty! I especially like the poutine!"}
{"text":"Did not blow my mind in the least. The line for takeout moves faster than you think, but the sandwich is much smaller than I thought it'd be, and much plainer, pretty bland besides the saltiness. Their fries looked amazing but we didn't have enough cash on us so we only ordered the smoked meat, having spotted the cash-only sign. Then we get up to pay and find out they take credit.. and the guy filling orders a few steps back wouldn't take 5 seconds to dump some fries in a paper bag for me, so I just huffed and puffed and bought fries across the street (bad idea, they weren't good)."}
{"text":"I like a place that does a few things and does them very well. Too many options make me anxious. At Schwartz's, the smoked meat on rye and pickle are pretty much all you need (maybe fries too). It's not just for tourists - the meat is really delicious and extremely satisfying (to the point of inducing a food coma). Don't plan to do or think much afterward. But worth the wait. Also, they move people through pretty fast, so don't be daunted by the queue."}
{"text":"First off, I do recommend going here as the food here was excellent -- I only rate it 3 stars due to service.
So, after you order, you have to walk over and pay at a separate spot than you order and when I walked up ready to pay, the lady at the register just glanced up at me, saw I had my ticket and cash ready, then just looked down and continued working for like 45 more seconds before verbally acknowledging me -- I know 45 sec isn't a lot, but it is when you're not quite sure what you're doing (it was my first time here). Anyway, she then took my cash and everything went smoothly other than her acting like I was completely inconveniencing her by actually paying for my food -- it was quite an awkward exchange. 

Oh well, went home and put some of the meat from my sandwich on an all dressed bagel with cream cheese from Fairmount Bagels and nearly died from how delicious it was -- highly recommend crafting this concoction yourself if you can!!"}
{"text":"Good smoked meat, in a sandwich or alone. Worth waiting for if line up is 10 min or less.

Prepacked meat revives well if steamed correctly.

Bottled seasoning good for a wide variety of things.

(unverified) \"but if you don't feel like waiting in line The Main Delicatessen directly across the street is just as good.\""}
{"text":"I'm was a Montrealer for 40 years, and I'm now an American.  I hadn't had smoked meat in about 10 years.  I was visiting Montreal for work, and on consecutive days I ate at Lester's (first) and at Schwartz's the very next day.  I'm sorry to say I have to \"profane the sacred name\": Schwartz's sucks.

Lester's meat was moist, correctly and adequately spiced and smoke flavor was low, but it was there.  Schwartz's meat was of lower quality, inadequately spiced to the point of blandness, and even though I ordered a medium, was very fat.  I tasted no smoke flavor at all.  It was really second rate smoked meat.

Schwartz's sour pickle was very good though, I must say.  (I didn't have a pickle at Lester's.)

Lester's was not at all crowded and service was very good.  Schwartz's service was also very good, but it was crowded and as usual I had to share the table I was at.  I didn't mind sharing, because I like talking to people.  (But I talked to people in Lester's too, without being crowded.)

Schwartz's looks like it caters to tourists and ex-Montrealers and anyone that doesn't know better.  Schwartz's has history, but not quality.  I'll be visiting Montreal again in a month and I'll go to Lester's, but not Schwartz's."}
{"text":"Good smoked meat sandwich, but can't really understand what all the fuss (and long lines) are all about.  My sandwich (ordered medium) was good, but a bit dry.  Not much different than corned beef sandwiches I'd get elsewhere...good, but not anything special.

On the other hand, I also got the cold salami sandwich.  That was much better-very moist and flavorful.  

Overall, not worth the wait--I thought Lester's served a far superior sandwich."}
{"text":"One word desrcibes The smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle, and a black cherry cola.= HEAVEN!l!"}
{"text":"Schwartz - the Mecca for famous Montreal Smoked Meat.....Knowing that the place is always crowded, I was prepared to wait for 30 minutes outside... Finally, I ordered my Smoked Meat sandwich with fries & dill pickle.. Well, there are enough reviews on this restaurant... So, I'd say that it didn't match my expectations...If you really love Smoked meat then I'd recommend same sandwich at 'Snowdon Deli' which melts in mouth and leaves a whiff to remember...

But, Schwartz's is surely a one time go if you visit Montreal..You won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"I had heard lots about Schwartz's and made a morning trip over while the rest of this motley crew bachelor party slept off a crazy night out.   Smoked meat hungover?  Delicious.  I llked the presence of peppercorns on the smoked meat but was hoping for either the brininess of corned beef or the complex character and melt-in-your-mouth goodness pastrami.  To me, this is Pastrami's poorer cousin.  Still delicious, but just not Katz's to me.  The price was right although they were a bit stingy with the bread (believe it or not).

Counter service was unspectacular, with my sandwich coming faster than it took the waiter to bring me out my coffee. 

But I can cross it off my list, and I'll probably be back next time I'm in Montreal or tonight if we get out of the bars before Schwartz's closes..."}
{"text":"Very tasty smoked meat. Friendly staff. Wanted to take some home but had no space in my luggage. I prefer getting the meat by itself. I hope they can ship their meat across Canada."}
{"text":"Literally the best smoked meat I have ever had.  The sandwiches are FULL of the meat and man, are they tasty! Getting a bite with a bit or fat filled your mouth with so much flavour! The meat is incredibly well seasoned and sandwiches are dressed with mustard. Quintessential Montreal food ladies and gentlemen. Not worth going to Montreal without going to Schwartz's! Also there are lines, but there is a sit down restaurant and a to go restaurant, so if you're ok with just the highly recommended original sandwich, just take out.

Can't wait to go again!!!"}
{"text":"I never understood why everyone made such a big deal about eating smoked eat in Montreal, and now that I've had it, I UNDERSTAND. I came here twice in my short trip because it is just THAT good. My personal suggestion is to get it medium fat with a side of pickles. The pickles compliment the fat perfectly! I waited about 30-45 minutes when I came for dinner but had no wait at all when I came for lunch, so I would highly suggest coming at odd hours. But regardless the wait was well worth it! The meat is SO incredible and honestly I can't explain it to you, you just have to come try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Not a better sandwich shop in omaha. The owner truly takes pride in quality ingredients that you will most certainly taste on the first bite."}
{"text":"Do you like feeling bad about yourself after eating a greasy sandwich?

YES: Get it extra fatty.
NO: Go to Slovenia down the street.

Do you like doing battle with hordes of tourists?

YES: Stare at your phone for 20 minutes.
NO: Go to the Main across the street.

Have you gone within the past year?

YES: Ça suffit.
NO: J'ai une manque...

{"text":"Since we were in Montreal, we were essentially required to indulge in smoke meat sandwiches. As far as tradition goes, smoke meat + Montreal = Schwartz's. 

The restaurant has been open since 1928, and the history shows when you're finally able to get a seat inside. The long, thin interior coupled with the restaurant's popularity makes for a very busy establishment. No matter how you slice it, you're going to have to get friendly with those around you.
The sandwiches are basic, and exactly what's you'd expect. You'll get an unreasonable amount of smoked brisket, between thin rye bread slices, with a spread of regular yellow mustard. The folks at Schwatz's obviously know not to mess with what's not broken, and serve you up a simple sandwich that people have lined up for for years. All that being said, history alone does not make a knock-your-socks-off sandwich. If we're being honest, these sandwiches are pretty dry. I definitely suggest giving yourself a squeeze of yellow mustard for dipping, and having a glass of water at the ready.

If you're looking to experience some culinary history, and a satisfying sandwich, try this place out."}
{"text":"Over priced food and unhelpful staff.  $21 for a regular combo? It should cost at most $9 for the quality. What are they thinking!?? We ordered at the counter because the servers were away from the post. Once we sat down to enjoy our food we were promptly  kicked out because we ordered take out. I tried to explain that we didn't know about their policy since it was our first time there but they did not care. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The mere act of looking up Schwartz's on Yelp has got me salivating for their signature smoked meat sandwich. Oh man, I am DYING over here in NYC! That's really saying something because I used to HATE smoked meat, and let me tell you a secret: when my friend insisted we visit Schwartz's, I groaned inwardly and thought, come on, I don't want to go to a damn deli on my vacation! Well, damn deli is right- damn delicious! Thanks Nga, for being such a foodie genius!

Upon seeing how crowded it was on our arrival, we decided to take our sandwiches to go and sit on a nearby bench. While prying open the wax paper used to wrap my sandwich, I nervously noticed a ton of meat (slathered with mustard) packed between two ordinary slices of bread, and wondered, how am I going to finish this sandwich monster especially since I know I'm not going to like it? I sneaked a peek at my friend and remembered what my well-mannered mom always told me: never ever, complain about food to your host/hostess and finish your plate. This wasn't a dinner I was invited to, I know, but hey, politeness is politeness so I took a big bite, and at that moment I was instantly reborn. I shamelessly used a plastic fork to continue eating the sandwich since I didn't want any pieces of meat to fall on the floor wasted.

I will never think the same way about smoked meat again, and I'm thinking of visiting Katz's here in NYC to see how their meat stacks up against Schwartz's. And to think, if I had traveled on my own, I wouldn't have bothered to stop by, so my stumbling upon Schwartz's and discovering a new love for smoked meat was meant to be by the Montreal gods!"}
{"text":"Delicious (but a little messy - I think the bread was not quite hearty enough to hold up to all the juicy meat filling). I had a smoked meat sandwich and a pickle. Simple, good food. 

I second the recommendation to skip the line for a table and order from the to-go side next door."}
{"text":"You know Katz Deli in New York?

The place where they filmed that scene with Meg Ryan faking an orgasm for the movie When Harry Met Sally?

That deli?

Well this is the Montreal equivalent, and ironically the day that I went there was a blackout.

They had blown a fuse.

Maybe that means this sandwich was mind-blowing.

Tender, smoked pastrami, great service...well I guess it is mind blowing."}
{"text":"Holy Crap!  If you are in Montreal you have to visit and grab a sando!  Will change your life!"}
{"text":"So glad we got to this iconic deli while enjoying Montreal. We waited in line approx. 30 minutes at lunchtime in order to have table service. Not sure what I enjoyed more- the sandwich or our server. The former was tasty and tender; the latter was sassy yet sweet. We had cole slaw and pickles and washed it all down with black cherry soda. This is cash only, too....which we didn't know, so hubs ran down the street to the ATM. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, but the wait at the line was quick when we were there before noon.
It's like a fast-food,  u seated, better order quick, enjoyed the famous smoke meat and better go fast when u done lol
Even that.. I keep going back becos the smoke meat is just-too-good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I just love it. You do get squished in with the seating but I think that's part of the whole experience. I mean, you don't go there to sit and chill with your friends, you literally go in, sit down, give your order, the food comes out in 2-3 minutes, you eat fast because it taste THAT good, then you get up, pay, and get out lol. The smoked meat sandwiches are amazing and I always get the pickle with it."}
{"text":"There's no doubt about it.  Schwartz's is a Montreal institution.  When we arrived for an early lunch and saw a line out the door, we knew it immediately must be one of the top food destinations for tourists.

The smoked meats are the star at Schwartz's and I can't help but be reminded of famous Jewish delis like Katz's or Carnegie Deli in NYC.  

I ordered the smoked meat sandwich and you can choose it in fatty, medium, or lean.  I opted for it to be medium and paired it with a Black Cherry Cola as recommended.

The line to sit in the restaurant was insane, but we barely saw any lines in the to-go entrance on the left, so went there.  There's a small sitting area in the back for the to-go orders and some merchandise to purchase as well as more deli meat products.  

As soon as we put in our order, a high proportion of the patrons waiting in the restaurant line came over to the to-go line and it was soon almost equally as long.  Crazy.  Go whichever line is shortest.

Smoked Meat Sandwich - $8. it's a bit smaller than I expected but only given the price and the comparison to American oversized pastrami sandwich (which are meant for two and cost $19).  The bread is rye bread and almost seems too small for the amount of meat but that's both because they stuff the meat but also because the bread is regular/small for a sandwich.  They put mayo and mustard, but I had to add extra of their excellent mustard for an even better kick.  

The smoked meat was great.  Like pastrami but different.  Not too salty and just right on the fattiness.   Despite my thinking the sandwich wasn't as huge as I envisioned, I was full by the end.  (the bigger guys in the group got two).

Pickle - a patron didn't want his pickle and offered it to me.  I like pickles but this was very sour and very heavily pickled.  Good with the cherry cola and thick and crunchy, but not my style. 

Smoked Meat Poutine - a friend got this variation and it's good too.  Lots of carbs, good cheese curds, delicious smoked meats, gravy.  I had a bite and you can't go wrong with poutine.  It's calories in an aluminum pan.  

Overall, I'm glad to have stopped by Schwartz's.  It's a quick and simple visit and it's no wonder the lines are so long.  I really liked the smoked meats and the mustard but bet their sandwiches used to be bigger than they are now.  

Schwartz's accepts credit cards."}
{"text":"What can I say that everyone else hasn't?  You pretty much have to go here when you're in Montreal.  The sit-down restaurant is on one side and the take-out restaurant / stand-up-and-eat-at-the-counter is right next door."}
{"text":"5 stars for the old world charm and experience. This place hasn't been touched since it opened over 80 year ago, making it the oldest in Canada.  

They have steaks, turkey and salami, but their smoked meat is the star of the show! Smoked in house, daily, you can order it lean, medium, medium fat or fat on rye bread and mustard. Pickles and coke slaw are served a la Carter and a must order along with their fries. 

Schwartz's is also credited with creating Montreal steak spice, which you can buy some on your way out. 

Sometimes there's long lineups, so come off peak times or be prepared to wait. There is a take out shop next door if you don't want to wait. You can also buy a pound or two of their smoked meat to take home with you. Always a good idea. :)"}
{"text":"Best smoked meat in Montreal. Fatty has the best flavour but it makes you feel like a pile of sludge."}
{"text":"Absolutely a must when traveling to Montreal. Further away from your typical touristy stuff in the city, Schwartz's shows off a little bit of Montreal's culture along side other interesting restos on the the popular Boulevard St. Laurent.   Staff are friendly and atmosphere is very unique to Montreal. My father grew up in Montreal and I've been here at this restaurant before as a kid,  so this place really hits home. They have the most delicious pickles in the world!!! Putters Pickles!! GET ONE...\"Montreal Smoked Meat\" is sold around the world, and it's awesome how this is as fresh and tasty as it gets. The Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich with a Black Cherry Cola, Fries, and a Putters Pickle , is the way to go!! All together with a tip was around $22.. It was funny at first when the friendly, laid back waiter mentioned a single pickle was considered 1 side.. then I figured it out when I looked in the display area at the front of the resto: Famous Putters Pickles are huge! They sell them in huge bottles!!"}
{"text":"Montreal Smoked Meat. With Poutine and cole slaw. Nothing fancy, just good food and fast service. We shared a huge sandwich, there was so much meat!"}
{"text":"The to-go line moves quick so don't be too upset if you can't get into the restaurant, as was our case.  Big but not unconquerable sandwiches and two types of really good coleslaw.  Not quite a New York kosher (style) deli...but definitely some Jews Canada can be proud of!"}
{"text":"I came to Schwartz's with a friend who came to town. I heard this is one of the MUST GO TO places in Montreal. I' not a fan of smoked meat but the sandwich I had here was really good.

When we arrived, the line was out the door and down the block, which is apparently pretty normal. Luckily, it moved quickly. The place inside is TINY and you sit elbow to elbow at a table with other people. A major turn off at first but the couple we were seated with were very cool. They'd lived in Montreal their entire lives and told us about their experience, other cool things to do... and even gave us advice on how/what to order. 

While the food was tasty, I feel like this is the kind of place you bring out of town friends to for a quick lunch just to say you did it."}
{"text":"We waited around 10 minutes outside, the place was packed with ..tourist..
We ordered lean meat smoked meat sandwich and rib steak. The sandwich ($6.65) was pretty good, the rib steak ($17.95) was also delicious. The rib steak came with grilled liver and small sausage. Our server was friendly. All in all it was an okay experience. We will try to find another smoked meat sandwich place that's less touristy..."}
{"text":"This is must do in Montreal. We felt like regulars on our first visit. The staff was very friendly and loved having fun with the patrons. The smoked meat was marbled perfectly when ordered medium. Fatty and lean are the other options. Stay away from lean. Fat is moisture and flavor. It was more than worth the short 20 minute wait. Of course poutine was on the menus along with other deli favorites. The neighborhood is hip and bohemian and worth exploring. I honestly don't see how you could go wrong."}
{"text":"Dear eight pound, six ounce, newborn baby Jesus, please bring me a smoked meat sandwich on rye with mustard from Schwartz's Deli, right now. Thank you.

Seriously, this place does not muck about with their pastrami. When you approach a restaurant and they have a big bay window hugging the front door on both sides, and one of the bays has like twelve sheets of wax paper spread out in it, with two dozen crusty, smoked briskets of pastrami stacked on it like cord-wood, fogging up said window, you know you are about to enter a place where shit is going down. 

I went here for the first time a few summers ago, secure in the knowledge that the best pastrami sandwich could be had at one of handful of places known to me in my then home of New York city, and that the ultimate determining factor was just were you a Katz's guy, or a 2nd Ave Deli guy, or did you subscribe to something a bit more obscure in the outer boroughs. Schwartz's shattered that little fantasy world.

I'll put it to you this way, go look up Plato's parable of the cave, and that will describe to you my experience of eating a Schwartz's smoked meat sandwich for the first time.

So back to the story.  We got inside the door and were immediately whacked in the face by the aroma of briney, smokey, fatty bliss-ket of pastrami, and headed to a seat at the counter. There was no question that we needed smoked meat sandwiches (that's what they are called on the menu - possibly due to the francophone thing - not sure). Our counter service guy comes over and starts engaging us in french, which of course neither of us speaks, so we ask if he speaks english. \"sure thing. what'll you have folks?\" New York accent, and all. I'm not afraid to say that I kind of wanted to kiss this man on the mouth at this exact moment.

So we got two smoked meat sandwiches on rye, with mustard, split an order of fries (NY deli style as well) and washed the whole thing down with cokes. I mean, really now, this was an outstanding goddamn meal, and the whole thing right down to the cokes coming in cans with glasses of ice on the side, to the brown mustard and the wax paper between the sandwich and the plate just oozed North Eastern US Jewish Deli. 

This sandwich is superior to any I have had in America (not just NY, but come on, NY leads the rest of the US in Jewish comfort food hands down, and I'm a die hard Red Sox fan admitting that). I love Katz's high stacked, house smoked pastrami on rye, and I love the sandwich that Yonah Schimmel made famous on 2nd Ave, but this thing is lean and fatty in all the right ways, and smokey and briney in such an uncanny balance that I dare say, regardless of their location, these folks have the pastrami sandwich against which all others should be judged.

If you live in Montreal, or even just Quebec, you have no excuse for not eating here regularly (unless you're a vegan or something). If you are visiting Montreal, eat here at least twice, I'm serious, and then you may want to grab a sandwich to go for the ride back to the states or to BC. Any way you end up here, just make sure you end up here. You are missing out on something wonderful if you don't."}
{"text":"Love their Montreal smoked Meat, the que is horrible but you can bypass it if you go in the pick up section (take out) ate here 2 time here in 3 days in Montréal.  AMAZINGLY Good"}
{"text":"A Montreal institution that offers smoked meat that tastes better than usual almost like lamb even if its beef. Honestly, there is no need to do an 1h hour line up to go to this place, there is another place on the other side of the street that is equally good, so dont bother.."}
{"text":"Was visiting my cousin in Canada, and he brought us here to Shwartz for dinner. There were six of us, so we got 3 plates of smoked meat, with the bread, and sides of pickles and peppers. It was absolutely delicious all around. The atmosphere is great, it is a small place so it gets very packed with a line outside. I definitely reccomend this place to all you meat lovers. If you live in or will be visiting the Montreal area of Quebec in Canada, then you must stop at Shwartz, definitely worth it.. A huge reccomend. It is a very well known and famous place too. News articles and pictures with celebrities and other famous people who've come here all over the walls. Great food and great service, what's not to like?!! :)"}
{"text":"DIRTY CUTLERIES! RUDE WAITER telling customers to remove their bags from a seat so prospective other customers who have not showed up yet can sit. On our table, multiple knives were still EXTREMELY DIRTY with meat stains all over them, and yet those knives were stacked up as if they were cleaned and ready to use for customers. 
The waiter repeatedly told us to cramp our 3 seats together and remove our bags from the 4th seat so other non-existent customers can sit and share our table. I have never met a waiter so rude!

These 2 things were the deal breakers for my family and me. We were already seated and ready to order our lunch, but we decided to leave Schwartz and take our business elsewhere.

NEVER AGAIN I WILL SET FOOT IN THIS F*&KING PLACE!"}
{"text":"Not the best smoked meat in town anymore, just like any number of \"institutions\" that persist for historic and cultural reasons rather than innovations in taste. The meat is dry, crumbly, and the lean cuts lack seasoning/spices. Tip: you must order the meat fat, otherwise all the flavours are forfeited..

I think it's a great sit-down to get some steaming smoked meat during a cold snowy winter day, but definitely not worth the wait on a hot summer afternoon. If the line is too long, try The Main right across the street. If you are adventurous, go to Smoke Meat Pete; it is the crown right now. I understand that Schwartz' is on Montreal's standard repertoire. Nothing against that, as long as you realize that good and iconic don't necessarily come in duo."}
{"text":"Awesome smoked meet,  it's melt in your mouth.  It's a small restaurant where you are asked to share a table with other patrons.  There is always a lineup to go there, even in the wee hours of the morning.  Go to Schwartz is an experience everyone should try at least once when they are in Montreal, one of a kind"}
{"text":"On researching what/where to eat at in Montreal, the one constant place everyone told me to check out was Schwartz's so I knew that was going to be the first place I was going to grab some grub.

We arrived around 1PM and there was a short line outside. We must have beat the rush because no more than 5 minutes had passed when someone came out asking the line for a party of 2. Luckily we were the first party of 2 and we were seated in the very back.

The menu is simple and here's what was ordered:

-small smoked meat ($5.90 CAD): I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich actually. I felt the meat was a bit dry and flavorless...except when you happened to get a bite of fat which then made the sandwich moist and flavorful. I think the meat is corned beef (?) so I guess the dryness is part of the meat property?
-pickles ($1.90 CAD): an order consists of 2 and they were crunchy and a bit too salty for me...but definitely good
-fries ($2.65 CAD): crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and not too oily. I might even have to say they're better than In-n-Out! Sufficient side dish amount.

The place is known for two things: the smoked meat sandwich and their cherry soda (which actually, you can find in NYC). Make sure you get the sandwich with mustard and if you plan on ordering the large sandwich, be warned that you make your own sandwich (they give you slices of bread and meat and you can make about 3 small sandwiches).

Schwartz's is good, but I wouldn't say it's exceptional or the best sandwich I've ever eaten. The price is nice though!

P.S.: you can order your meat to be carved lean, fatty and some other in between option. If you don't mention anything, your sandwich cut defaults to lean."}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5 star place in my opinion.   Schartz's is known for their smoked meats sandwiches.  Smoked meat / mustard on rye? bread.  The meat was moist and very tasty.   The bread is lacking in any flavor is and greatly over whelmed by the meat.  Worth a try, simple and good sandwich."}
{"text":"Busy and a disorganized seating arrangement.  One would think \"to go\" would be faster.  But no- really go for the sit down.  I promise it will be faster.

The smoked meat IS delish, BUT I don't know if I'd say I was blown away.  What I love about it is that you can choose your level of fattiness which is quite lovely.  And at almost 10 bucks for a half (staaacked) sandwhich its actually not THAT great of a deal.

good, not great.
had I not been bitter about waiting, I maybe woulda given it 4 stars."}
{"text":"I get It. I understand why people hype this place up so much. Be prepare to wait in line if you want a table and to be served. Next door, there is a togo line and It is MUCH faster. Just go with the \"hot meat\" which is corned beef. Fries are pretty good but oily af. 

You can expect the meat to be medium fat and a little oily like pillows of heaven. The sandwiches are small but have a ton of meat! Also prices are extremely reasonable, about $7 for a sandwich. Went with a group of 12 people and we paid $190 for 12 sandwiches and drinks plus a few fries.... Schwartz's for the win"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Schwartz's smoked meat sandwich is the best to go for. It is an entertaining experience to just watch them handle the meat."}
{"text":"We always, always, go to this place as many times as possible if we are in Montreal vicinity. Have sent numerous US friends to this place on their visit to Montreal, even the hardcore NYC deli devotees rave about Schwartz's.  I can modestly claim that Schwartz's has the best smoked meat, anywhere!

I like mine medium lean. The mustard doesn't do much for me and I can enjoy the meat just the same without, but why fight the tradition so I usually take the default setting which has the mustard auto on. Do get a pickle or pickles."}
{"text":"This resto is a landmark of Montreal. You know a place is good when people do a line for hours to get in there."}
{"text":"I thought this was a little overrated lol. Had that same meat sandwich at the airport and I thought it was pretty much the same. Maybe I can't tell cause I don't usually eat it"}
{"text":"They got great smoke meat sandwiches, but the waiting in line is long"}
{"text":"Arrivés là bas sur les conseils de divers blogs de voyageurs, on se rend compte très vite que c'est \"The Place to go\" à Montréal pour déguster de la viande fumée !
Presque 20 minutes de queue pour rentrer mais ça vaut le détour. La salle n'est pas très grande et il y a beaucoup de monde, donc à éviter pour un repas en amoureux ! 
La déco est indescriptible : le temps s'est arrêté il y a quelques années déjà ! Au mur de nombreux articles de journaux et des photos de plusieurs artistes ayant visité l'endroit ! (Entre autre, la Céline nationale !)
Pour le plat typique, vous êtes au bon endroit ! Au choix des assiettes de viande fumée ou des sandwichs de viande fumée. 
Des portions copieuses, servies rapidement et surtout vraiment bonnes ! Accompagnée de poutine, et là, vous savez que vous êtes à Montréal :)

Seul bémol : la carte bleue n'est pas accepté et le distributeur au fond du magasin ne marche pas toujours !"}
{"text":"I really liked schwartz, but the smoked-meat seemed like regular smoked-meat to me. I don't know if I'm just particularly easy to please when it comes to food or if the other places I've eaten smoked-meat at get their products from Schwartz directly. 

The common tables inside are a cute touch and it definitely is fun to just sit in a place that's so wildly popular."}
{"text":"The best smoked meat sandwich I have ever had. I didn't want to waste time waiting in line for the sit-down restaurant, so we ended up going to the deli / to-go store right next door. We did end up having to wait a little bit to order, but it wasn't too long. 

They actually do have some counter seats in the back, so we grabbed a couple chairs and split a sandwich. We weren't too hungry and just wanted to try some of the famous smoked meat sandwich so this was a perfect amount of food. The meat was so juicy and flavorful that it melted right in your mouth. The bread was slightly dry but the amount of fat and juices from the meat balanced it out. Would definitely come back again to order the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I can't believe people rave about this place.  We went there because it was mentioned as a must-do thing to do in Montreal.  I really have no idea why, I wonder if this is a result of a very successful marketing campaign.  The meat is fine, the bread selection is mediocre, the wait is long and the inside makes McDonalds look great in comparison.  Montreal has so many great restaurants and cafes, I am puzzled why this place gets mentioned at all."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of deli style sandwiches, but everyone said you had to get smoked meat in Montreal and my husband is a fan. So, I went on a Sunday afternoon and there was a line down the street. I decided to go through the other side and get take out. So if you are starving and can't wait, then try the door to the left for take out.nThe to go menu is very short. 3 sandwiches and fries are about it, but there are tons of smoked meat by the pound available. It smelled so good, that I had to try one for myself and it was delicious! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the staff wasn't especially on point."}
{"text":"I was told that no trip to Montreal is complete without hitting up Schwartz's for their classic meat sandwich. The sandwich comes loaded with tender smoked meat and mustard. If you like pickles, order one on the side. The crisp tanginess of the pickle really complements the hearty sandwich.

Soda lovers should try the black cherry coke. I don't drink much soda, and even I loved it. The flavor is very sweet, sort of in the same family as grape juice, and pairs well with the smoked meat.

While Schwartz's is definitely worth a visit for the charm factor, I would not say they make the best meat sandwich I've ever had. The bread was too soft in the center and the crust was too chewy. I could also have used more flavor - maybe marinate the meat with more salt or pepper, or add some onions. I gave 4 stars for combination food and ambience, but the sandwich alone is more like 3-3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I waited in line at the takeout for about 15 minutes, not bad at all! Yes, it's $9 for a sandwich. Yes, you may have doubts because every tourist loves this place. Yes, it looks just like a regular sandwich that you can get in any deli.

BUT YOU'RE WRONG!

Schwartz's smoked meat is something I have never had before in my life. The meat was stacked so high, I couldn't figure out where the little halves of bread were supposed to go! The flavor was so good, I was licking the dripping juice off my wrist (I know, gross). The mustard went so well with this sandwich that I was drooling for the next one as I had just started my first half. 

I tried to get another sandwich to go for my drive back to New York, but alas - they only open at 10:30.

I'll be back for you, Schwartz."}
{"text":"This is an absolute must for me every time we visit Montreal. There is no substitution. 

I always go to the take out side as the restaurant side will often have a pretty big lineup. The takeout side has a sandwich counter and packaged meats, mustards and pickles available to go. There is a small seating area if you can nab a spot.

Quick tip, always ask for fatty cut of smoked meat. Your soul will thank me, even if your heart doesn't."}
{"text":"This is the place I ran into my acquaintance who was also visiting from New York. This could say how hot this spot is. Meat is still good, oh yeah~"}
{"text":"Most overrated Smoke meat restaurant I've ever tried. I've gone there a few time over the years simply from travelers asking to try it and, at best it's good, never great. Besides there's the Main restaurant right across the street that has the best smoke meet I've ever tried and the poutine rocks too."}
{"text":"Lemme start off with I love meat.  I love hot juicy smoked meat.  And therefore, I had to have Schwartz here in Montreal.  Is it the best sandwich ever?  Nope, but for smoked meat, it's pretty good for what it is.  There's a good flavor but its not on the same level as Katz Deli, which I'm holding up high.  But I got the sandwich and some pickles and side of fries which easily made for a satisfying meal.  

The lines however, are ridiculous.  My friends and I (a party of 15 with a losing chance of ever getting seated) decided to go to the sandwich only place next door to fulfill ourselves in the smoky meat goodness."}
{"text":"we did the non-restaurant side cos the restaurant side looked too packed. smoked meat poutine! we were served up a vat that weighed about 10 lb (not really, but between the wife and i, we could barely put a dent in however much they gave us.).

the eat in area of the non-restaurant side is tiny, just a couple strips of bar seating, but we were able to get seats and stare at the napkin wall (i guess people write odes to schwartz on their otherwise unused napkin).

ireally liked their meat - super tender and not overly salty. i'd come again but if history is any indication (the last time i was in montreal was 1967), it might be awhile."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, not a great experience. Place is run down, long line, cash only. The smoked meat is fine, but had better elsewhere in Montreal. Slaw was watery, rye was nothing to write home about.

I think it's a shame if visitors to Montreal end up here rather than the million other amazing restaurants."}
{"text":"We heard from a number of friends about Schwartz's. Coming from New York, we were skeptical, to say the least. 

Well we were proven wrong. The smoked meat sandwich was absolutely delicious and the Cole slaw was amazing. Yes, the sandwiches are a little small, but that (and the cheaper price) were actually kind of refreshing in contrast with the massively overwhelming $25 sandwiches we're used to. 

Overall a great experience with just enough food to keep you happy at a cheap price. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just recently had a \"smoked meat\" sandwich here in the Bay Area and it sucked so bad it reminded me of how much I miss the real thing. This is one of the best sandwiches we've ever had... anywhere. It was ten degrees and snowing when we went here... and we had to walk... and we still went. Twice..."}
{"text":"I rolled deep to this joint with 12 people, only to find a line that was longer than the welfare line in Michigan.  Considering all the fat American's lining up outside, I knew this must be good.  I've actually eaten here once before, but it was the last stop on my Montreal '07 eating tour, so although it was good, it was also the first thing out when I went home to vomit.

I skipped breakfast, skipped the restaurant line, and went straight to the take out line next door.  Same food, minimal wait.  MAN - this was so good I could have rubbed the warm smoked meat all over my body and not even be embarrassed.

I ate only one sandwich so I didn't get too full, and thus savor the fine memories of juicy meat satisfaction.  Mmmm...smoked."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat in Montreal.
A place a tourist has to visit.

I tried the smoked meat, steak and french fries. The best in town."}
{"text":"No fewer than four people in New Orleans and other far-flung places recommended--nay, pretty much *required*, as the basis for continued friendship--that we include a stop at Schwartz's on a whirlwind visit to see our son at McGill.  

We did, and we understand.  

You go for the \"smoked meat\", the deceptively generic-sounding menu mainstay. (There are other items, such as turkey, salami, and chicken, but we'll leave those for another visit).  

The smoked meat comes in three degrees of fattiness. Sorry to have to shorten your lifespans, but stick to the medium and fatty.  Schwarz's sandwich is a simple presentation of bread with a swipe of mustard.  The lean would work on a more complex sandwich, but in this presentation it's flavorless.  I worried that the the fatty would arrive with chunks of free-standing fat, but it doesn't.  There is simply more of the flavor-bearing fat elixir in the meat pile.  Go for the fatty and don't look back.  Just walk an extra, oh, ten miles or so after you eat.  

The pickles and cole slaw are outstanding, to the extent that this place would be in four or five star territory even if the meat was store-bought bologna.  The sour and dill pickles and the zesty, non-mayonnaisey slaw drew multiple \"best I've ever had\" comments from our dining party.  Vegetarians might want to stop here just for those two dishes, even if it might be a bit awkward explaining the order to the waiter."}
{"text":"Great sandwich, and this was an enjoyable experience. The black cherry soda I got(and decided to try that, based on other reviews) was also pretty good here. Service felt like it was slightly lacking, but no huge deal since I've dealt with more surly waiters/etc. at other restaurants. And I think we got lucky with the line. I don't think it's quite 5 star good, but it's still a very enjoyable experience. Reading in other reviews about their long lines(and luckily avoided that factor, by coming not long after it opened) makes me think it's probably timing coming here at just the right times, to avoid when the line is the longest(a la Hot Doug's in Chicago).

If I ever return to Montreal, I'd probably try a different smoked meat place(likely Lester's, from reading its reviews), or just do an order here for take out."}
{"text":"I hate to be negative but I was expecting a lot more after reading about Schwartz's. It's basically a packed diner (where you have to sit with others) that offers 1 type of smoked meat. You get a ton of meat but it's basic service and cash only. We waited in line and then were so underwhelmed with the menu. I was expecting there to be at least 3 or 4 types of smoked meat to choose from but it was just your standard brisket. My friend got the liver plate. The pickle was very good. They gave me a plate of bread and a plate stacked with meat and that was that which was interesting. I tried to tell them I didn't want the bread before they ever served it so that felt very wasteful to me. The liver plate was tiny. The fries were okay but we didn't even order them so were a bit meh about having to pay for them. The waiter was friendly enough but clearly in it for the bigger parties like the six that sat down next to us and were ordering a ton of food. It wasn't worth the hype at all and I didn't feel the meat was anything special. Not a place that I'd return to."}
{"text":"A Montreal icon for which you come more for the history than for the actual food. It is good pastrami, definitely, but not lets-wait-90min-good. Anyway, the meat is definitely good and it is indeed a great deli, get a pickle (or two), some slaw and some cherry soda, snap a pic and you've got a great thing checked off a Montreal bucket-list and a yummy sandwich in your belly."}
{"text":"It's usually packed, with line ups starting two doors down outside. But if you like smoked meat, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Yeah. This was pretty much AWESOME.  
1. Do take out and eat outside in the park.
2. Get the meat \"medium.\"  It has a little bit of fat on it still, but it's flavor is UNBEATABLE."}
{"text":"Layover or otherwise you have to go to Schwartz's when in Montreal.  That and St Viateur bagels.  Must do it!!

The best smoked meat period.  Wait outside in a constant line of carnivores waiting to satisfy their urge.  Line moves pretty quick.

Cozy close quarters, efficient friendly service, and that smoked meat!!!  Sides of fries, slaw, and pickle.

Yum yum yum...."}
{"text":"What else can I say about this place that has not been said already....hmm...the reviews are great for a reason and there is a reason why they have been open for almost 100 years. Everg single time we come to Montreal we have to come here no matter rain or shine. There was a line up because we had the bright idea to go during lunch and of course it had to be raining while we were waiting....originally they told us it was going to be a 1 hour wait but the rain kept pouring so I KNEW that groups in front of us would eventually give up so all we had to do was wait it out....and JUST LIKE WAITING for a big fish automatically 3 groups left and we were right in front.

We finally get into the diner and ordered poutines, smoke meat sandwiches, and cherry cola. It was the first time I had the Smoked meat Fresh on a plate as opposed to my usual in a car while driving from a takeout container.  Both versions are good but the fresh sit down version was sooo delicious!!!

The service here is phenomenal and the staff are all really friendly and efficient! It took awhile for us to get our sandwiches due to a small mix up but our server did not hesitate and immediately apologized and gave us 3 free poutines to make up for it without us even asking and then the sandwiches came right away!  NOW THATS SERVICE with a Smile!

I will definitelys be coming back here on my next Montreal visit!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I live in Vancouver and have travelled across most of Canada and been to Deli's in New York and I've yet to taste anything like this. This is the best smoked meat sandwich in North America."}
{"text":"I have worked for a Montreal-based company for a few years now and I really haven't ventured out by myself to try some of Montreal's most-reviewed restaurant (on Yelp).  Tonight, I chose the infamous Schwartz's.

It is located north of downtown on a busy main street - you might miss either of the two entrances if it weren't for the line of people out in front waiting for a table.  Yes, this place is relatively small and always packed.  Don't fret though - most meals take less than 20 minutes and the guys who work the door are great at getting people in (and out).  Be prepared to sit elbow to elbow with other diners though.  I was seated at the counter, where I could watch the magic.

I am not sure of the age of this place, but it is staffed by young men who know their business.  The food speaks for itself, but the servers add a bit of \"flavor\" by being personable and highly efficient.  You can shout out that you need more water or your bill and someone will hear you and get to it.

Note that the menu is not big - basically it's meat and meat.  I saw plenty of people order steaks, with a side of meat and a side of sausage.  I would not recommend this place to vegetarians, although they do offer sides of fries, cole slaw and pickles (all of which I was happy to enjoy).  I had the standard fare that they are known for - Montreal smoked meat.  I know it is sacrilege for me to call it pastrami, but it is as close to a NYC pastrami sandwich as I've ever had.  The bread is fresh and cut to order.  The guy by the window cuts the meat and throws it over the bread, which has been mustarded (yes, I just made up a word).

Note that they don't have any alcohol (hence why people are in-n-out in less than 20 minutes?) just canned sodas and juice.  Try the Black Cherry Cola - it is a perfect combination with the above mentioned items I had

Also, cash only (I think)"}
{"text":"This place is as good as anyone has ever claimed it to be!!!!!!! 

Got the combo ribeye steak with the smoked meat and a bit of liver. Even the pickles are amazing!!!! I wasn't crazy about the fries, but it doesn't even matter!!!! 

We might go back there again tonight before we leave MTL"}
{"text":"Location: On the main. Street parking is available [metered] or you can hop off the subway at Mont-Royal [orange] and walk down, or you can hop off the subway at St. Laurent [green] and walk up. You can also grab the 55 bus if you're anywhere on St. Laurent. OK? OK.

The place: Old-school diner feel with communal tables and counter seating. 

The goods: OK. So I knew it was about time I try these guys out since they're considered to be a smoked meat institution and all, but I have this thing where I refuse to wait in line for food. Especially if I'm hangry. Not going to happen. As luck would have it, my friend and I decided to come here on a whim yesterday (a Monday) around 12:30-1pm. There was zero line-up and we got a table right away. I ordered my smoked meat lean and my friend who is pro-fat, went for the full-fat version. We ordered a side of fries to share and of course, a pickle. In terms of the smoked meat, wow was it ever dry. Now, I understand that I ordered mine lean and some dryness is to be expected, but I've had lean smoked meat before that was nowhere near as dry. It was also thicker than I'm used to but I'm OK with that. In terms of flavor, I really enjoyed it - but the dessert-dry feel didn't work for me. The fries were good - I'm not sure if they were home-made or not. That pickle was awesome. My friend enjoyed his plate - and he's from NYC where Katz's is famous for it's pastrami & co. so....

Service: Great! Literally every staff member we dealt with was super nice and friendly. We talked meat, we talked mustard, and we talked tattoos and music. What's not to love, you? Nothin'. 

Price point: I'm not 100% since my buddy treated me but I think 2 plates + pickle + fries + 2 drinks came out to about $30. I think it's a little expensive for smoked meat, especially considering that everything else was on the side."}
{"text":"It is really nice to check out a place like this because it is well known however you might be disappointed if you are from the New York City Area or any other area known for delis. The food was good but tasted the same as typical other delis. What set this place apart for me was the staff. They were great, very patient and friendly. I loved talking to them. Swartz is cash only."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat sandwich in Montreal period. Fresh, juicy, perfectly smoked and delicious!"}
{"text":"OHMYGAWD MEAT. Smoked meat is a Montreal obsession, and Schwartz's does it so, so well. It's been here forever, it's always packed. It's that good. 

The smoked meat sandwich, mon dieu . . . it is glorious. I need say no more."}
{"text":"The first and last place I went to when I was in Montreal. I had heard of great things about Schwartz's from many of my friends. The smoked meat sandwich was just mind blowing. It was extremely flavorful and the meat was just right. The bread was a perfect combination with the smoked meat. Get take-out! It is a lot faster than the restaurant. I was in love with the flavor of he smoked meat that I couldn't resist and purchased 2 gift bags of the seasoning just for myself. When you visit Montreal, Schwartz's is a must! You must come here or you'll be missing out. I'm sad that there is no where in New York that makes their meat even close to Schwartz yet. I would definitely go back to Montreal just to get the smoked meat sandwich again."}
{"text":"This place is a must if you are ever in Montreal! Be prepared to wait in line, but don't let the line outside discourage you. The smoked meat sandwich at $9.75 is the real deal. Service is fast, so you don't wait long once you make it inside."}
{"text":"Can't go to MTL without going to Schwartz!! 

Only got take-out but even by the time I got back to the hotel the sandwiches were still amazing as always. The only service I got was the guy who took my order and the cashier. 

I ordered all my sandwiches extra fatty and the guy who took my order made sure of that, he even said after these fatties you're going to want them lean next time. Man was he right LOL. The cashier was less interested in cracking jokes and making small talk, just doing her job just trying to get to the end of the line vibe, very blunt and straightforward with everything. Can't blame someone for (ONLY) doing what they're hired to do though. 

Surprising for Saturday afternoon the take out line exceeded the dine in line(3PMishhh), which I wished i dined in instead but when you got a bunch of hungover homies waiting for you, kinda a no brainier (if you're a decent friend) to get the food to them as soon as possible. No pickle included for take out sandwiches -rolls eyes- 

Living in Toronto, smoked meat is a rare commodity but is still pretty decent ... until you visit Montreal and realize that Schwartz will always be the best! I mean come on they had a musical and Celine Dion('s husband) purchased partial ownership just so they never change the original recipe, if that doesn't say something than...

Will repeat every single time I visit Montreal! I"}
{"text":"Schwartz's was high on our list of places to visit when in Montreal. My husband loves smoked meats, and we'd heard comparisons to Katz's in New York, so we were eager to try their sandwiches.

Plus, we hadn't eaten anything more than a tiny poutine sample and some nibbles on a beer tour prior, so we were starving.

Everybody said to be prepared for a wait. As a tourist attraction, it gets busy. It was almost 6:30 pm on a Friday night when we approached the restaurant, and though there was a line out front, it wasn't nearly as bad as I had expected.

They do a good job of managing the people outside and clearing tables inside. We thought we were going to have a wait of upwards of 20 minutes ahead of us, but the guy working the line got us inside and at a table for 4 (with another couple) within five minutes.

It is crowded inside. The deli counter runs along the right side of the restaurant, taking up most of the space inside. Tables are crammed along the left side, with a very narrow aisle for servers and customers to walk down. The register is located at the front of the store (inconvenient if you're in the first table with your back to the register, like me), and the restrooms are squished in towards the back.

Menus are either above the counter or on a placemat on your table. The harried wait staff will come by to take your order, though, which is nice because fighting the crowd to get to the counter would have been a nightmare.

Our waitress suggested the smoked meat sandwich (\"of course\"), which we each ordered. To that, we added an order of the hand-cut fries and the pickles. 

While we waited, I tried to make small talk with the couple across from us. We were forced to sit together, and we were both trying Schwartz's for the first time. I was trying to be nice. I asked, \"So, where are you two from?\" and got, \"Ontario\" out of them before they shut me down. That didn't make for an awkward meal at ALL.

The food came out quickly, which I absolutely appreciated (because I was starving, not because the other couple was making things strange.) The pickle(s) that we had ordered turned out to be one regular-sized dill pickle, whole. The fries were a bit cold and didn't look like a whole lot.

As for the sandwich...my husband liked it a lot more than I did. The meat was good, and the bread was soft and moist, but it didn't wow me the way Katz's sandwiches did. 

It was good to try, and I'm glad we went, but after we left, we both agreed that there was no need to try to go back. It's too frenzied inside, and it's kind of pricey for what you get. You know - at Katz's you pay through the nose, but you're given a sandwich the size of your face. Here, it's kind of expensive for a regular-sized sandwich. Maybe that's just the American in me expecting everything to be \"super-sized\", though."}
{"text":"Ordered the #4. So much smoked meat! Wayyyyy too much even for a meat lover. 
Tip: they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Awesome smoked meat. Be ready to pass out after eating this sandwich. The pickle was so juicy, but a little too salty for my liking."}
{"text":"Vacationing in Monetreal:
I was wandering around my hotel looking for a place to eat for dinner and saw a huge line outside this place. I decided to stand in line to see what the commotion is all about. 

Initial reaction: This place reminds me of an old school restaurant you see in movies. This place has been around for nearly 80 years. The dining area is brightly lighted and pictures and newspaper clippings covered the wall. There's even a counter for solo eaters like me to eat. I ended up talking to a guy next to me and now we're friends. According to the staff they have hooked up two couples this month! Overall a very lively experience.

What I ordered: The guy next to me recommended me to try their smoked meat sandwich and get the pickle. Normally, I am really critical of sandwiches because they all taste the same to me. 

Time to order to time served: Food came out quite quickly (should've take that long since it's only a sandwich right?) even with a packed house and people waiting for a table outside. 

Food: I can see why there's a huge line outside. The sandwich itself is packed with meat and it was delicious. The fact that I was hungry made the sandwich taste even better. As stated before, I'm not much of a sandwich person and this is good. Wash it down with a soda and some fries and it's a winning formula.  

Bathroom: Didn't get to use it so I cannot comment. 

Customer Service: The customer service was very straight forward and aggressive but still in a friendly way. I did not feel unwelcomed or rushed even though I was a bit dazed with all that commotion when I first walked in.  

Would I eat there again: Yes, I will eat there again even though I'm not a sandwich and to me that's a pretty big deal. This place is not that cheap. For a smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle, soda was about 13 dollars."}
{"text":"Great place for a straight up smoked meat lunch.  My only complaint is that they are so good that they are almost always packed. A great place to visit as long as long as you have the time.  As a side note, their packaged meat available in many supermarkets in Montreal is not bad either."}

Came in on a Friday night. Not overly busy but all tables are communal. Staff are super friendly and are great to have conversations from. Most of the staff I talked to were not from Montreal, instead, from Ontario!

The Smoked meat we all opted for was Lean and it was a little dry but you are warned by the staff before hand. They give you a huge chunk of meat in your sandwhich and it is quite satisfying after eating a whole sandwhich. 

It cost about 10$ and it is a cash only establishment. However, when I did go to pay, I left a 2.25 tip and the cashier did say \"that's it?\" which i was a little weary and not happy about... How much more did the cashier expect on a 10$ meal?

Beware of long lines if you go during lunch/dinner time though! The line can go out the door!"}

I ordered the smoked meat sandwich medium. (The medium refers to the amount of fat on the beef I presume. I was told it's the only way to do it.) The sandwich is a half pound of smoked beef on rye bread with yellow mustard. My goodness, it's AMAZING! 

The fries were also very very good! I would come for the fries also! I went to another place before I left town that was offering a \"smoked meat\" sandwich. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY IMPOSTERS! Schwartz's makes the sandwich you want! 

P.S. It's cash only."}

Around since time immemorial (ok, 1928), this deli may not have invented smoked meat...but you won't find it better anywhere else. 

Got there around 8pm on a Friday night to a line leading out the door. Fortunately, turnover for the few tables and counter stools is VERY quick. My friend and I were seated at a table with a young family. I knew my order as soon as I sat down: smoked meat (medium fat), sour pickle, black cherry soda. My friend snagged the same with fries instead of a pickle.

The meat was tender, gently smoky, and maddeningly delicious. The seasonings are assertive without overwhelming and the sour pickle provides a biting contrast.

In and out in less than half an hour. And, yes: that sandwich was worth the 8 hours or so it took to get to Montreal"}

I would have to go back and try something different to give it 5 stars. So good. Never had a a sandwich like that before."}
{"text":"Amazing food. A bit of a long wait but totally worth it! We had the smoked meat sandwich, which was packed with meat. The meat was tender and filled with flavour. I did add a bit of more mustard on the sandwich. My boyfriend had the combo, which I had a bite of each meat piece on there. The marinade on the steak was incredible and it was kept juicy and moist. The bread was incredible, but my favourite side was either the coleslaw or the sour pickle. I honestly couldn't choose. The coleslaw was like a step up of KFC, with a vinagery-sweet taste. The sour pickle was probably the best pickle I've ever had (and I eat a lot of pickles)."}
{"text":"If you are ever in Montreal you have come here for a smoked meat sandwich. Smoked meat is Montreal's version of pastrami and it is amazing, so tender and flavorful w/ a smear of their hot mustard. We planned to split a sandwich to save room to grab a small bite somewhere else but after the smells got to us we each got a sandwich & split a side of fries w/ a pickle. It was more than enough to fill us up. We will be back again during our annual trip to visit friends."}

{"text":"HIGHLIGHT OF MY MONTREAL TRIP
Seriously if you are making a trip to montreal for the first time, you absolutely have to come to Schwartz for their infamous smoked meat sandwich. During my trip, I came here twice because it was just that good! 

There are two stores to this that are next to each other. One store with the giant line outside of it is for the dine-in section while the other side is for take out. I came on a friday night the first time and luckily there wasn't too long of a line for the dine-in section but when I came back on sunday afternoon, the line was soooo long. It was easter sunday so i guess more people were out and about?? there was also a line in the take-out part but the line moved super quick!

You get the option of picking if you want the meat to be lean or medium fat. Definitely get with the fat because some of the pieces were super tender and juicy! Add some mustard and boom, one of the best sandwiches i've ever had hands down! Definitely will be my first stop the next time I go to Montreal.

They are cash only and also accept american dollars (USD) but there is a 10% surcharge!"}
{"text":"We shared two large plates among the four of us. The smoked meat was tasty and staff was very friendly. Do try to avoid the peak hour crowd though."}

C'est un endroit mythique, qui n'a pas changé avec le temps
Il y a toujours un line up et des touristes qui passent des heures à attendre pour y goûter
Il y a des photos de célébrités au mur et il est possible de manger au comptoir
Il y a également des produits dérivés à acheter; on peut aussi acheter de la viande fumée à emporter
La viande est simplement... délicieuse!"}
{"text":"A friend from Montreal suggested I come here: I enjoy checking out local favs, and he highly suggested this one.

Got to the spot around 10:30PM: the storefront is old school and we could see the line for take out through the glass door (note, I did do take out so I have no idea what the waitstaff service is actually like, but the place is tiny and there was an old guy who was very informal both directing take out line traffic/in house dinning traffic while serving food). Very casual place with 1930's decor (pretty sure 90% of the interior has never been updated). For those of you who have been to Katz's in NY, very similar look and feel, just a lot smaller (also smells phenomenal, just as Katz's does).

You order your food at the counter and then turn around and walk 10 steps to pay the cashier (very inefficient, but I am sure they wanted to keep the feature from back in the day). The guy who takes orders isn't very helpful (no suggestions when you ask him what's good; seemed sort of annoyed that tourists impeded on his local spot area), but I ended up playing it safe and ordering the smoked meat sandwich. While I was waiting for my food, I was a bit worried that the meat wouldn't live up to my expectations: as soon as I walked in, I thought to compare the place to Katz's, so when I saw the meat slicer (Katz's only hand cuts their meat bc its so tender that it would fall apart in the meat slicer), I started to doubt.

No need! For a $7/$8 sandwich, I thought this was great value; not the largest pastrami I ever had, but the taste was great (meat, rye bread, a little bit of mustard). The thing may not be oozing with juice, but the meat is moist and flavorful just the same. Each bite was delicious, with a little bit of variety (whether you get the peppery skin or the moist, center pieces with a tad of mustard).

Overall, great experience, and a place I would suggest people who visit Montreal to go."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to get a great parking spot right in front of Schwartz's on St Laurent.  I had to remind myself how Montreal parking works... it's been a while since I've driven in the city.  You have to know your parking spot assigned number so you can enter it into the parking machine on the street.  You don't need to put the ticket on your dash, you just need to make sure you're entering the right spot assigned number in to the machine.

I didn't see any lines so this was good... it was about 4:45pm.  Walking into the place it was still packed.  There was a single stool at the bar so I ended up taking that spot which worked out since I was by myself.

The choice was simple... smoked meat sandwich!!!  If I didn't get the fries I probably could have eaten 2 sandwiches.  I did get the fries which are basically fries but they are good.  The black cherry Cott soda was a good compliment.  I'm trying to drink less pop these days but really it was a must to complete the trinity.  

This sandwich is spot on and this is one of the reasons why Montreal will always have one up on TO when it comes to food... IMO this one food item is one of the cornerstones of Montreal's food extravaganza.  If it's not their version of bagels, or pizza or steamies it's their smoked meat and this place serves the best I've had.  

I went to Katz in NYC but didn't get end up eating there.  We walked in and walked out pretty fast.  Why?  It felt like I was lining up for get on a Disney ride before the reservation system.  Thanks but no thanks... it was a long walk that day in the summer in lower Manhattan and although I can't compare what Schwartz's has compared to Katz's I probably won't ever have to.  Schwartz's was no nonsense, quick, no line up and I didn't have to feel like I needed a wristband to get into a club that had bottle service.

Schwartz's again = the best I've had in my life for Montreal smoke meat.  Carnegie Deli on 7th Ave in NYC so far is the best corned beef and pastrami I've had.  

Schwartz's prices also are not outrageous either.  Considering they serve a lot of sandwiches both eat in and take out their consistency of their quality has really no choice but to be what they are in order to garner the attention they deserve.  

I will have to now make this restaurant a must go place every time I go to Montreal now... I think I may go there again on the way out of town too!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of smoked meat. The line up to sit in the restaurant for this place was out the door down the street. The longer line up was for take out. We might have waited about 30 mins. Had the smoked mean sandwich with a pickle."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to the world-famous Schwartz's.  

If ever given the choice between lean and medium... My rule of thumb is to always choose medium.  There ain't nothing like smoked meat with a tad bit of fat to give you that mouth-melting goodness!  Their fries are heavenly.  It appears they fry them twice.  Whatever it is that they do, it is just bursting with potatoe-y goodness!

For me, the sandwich itself is a little bit oily, but still tastes amazing.  It is on my list of \"to-do's\" every single time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Going to this place is kinda s must-do thing when u travel to Montreal. 
Tbh the price is kinda high, compared to other same deli restaurants(maybe because of its brand). There always a big line during the dinner or lunch time. 
The meat was savoury, juicy, smokey and tasty. But kinda oil."}
{"text":"Délicieux, mais il faut prendre à emporter. L'endroit est toujours rempli à craquer, et l'amabilité des serveurs est catastrophique. C'est limite si on les ennuie d'être venu. Les prix sont raisonnables."}
{"text":"This place is legendary. Though there are other great places for smoke meat, nothing beats the environment at Schwartz's. You share your table with other groups, the waiters are direct (sometimes a bit too direct) and the decor hasn't changed in decades. The food is also really good. I recommend getting a medium fatty smoke meat sandwich, get a pickle and if ur hungry, get some fries. The place isn't made to hang around at (the line gets long), so eat your delicious food, pay at the front and get out!"}
{"text":"Have to be honest, living in Texas and going to Katz's in Lower East Side regularly I do appreciate the smoked meats here, but nothing beats Texas smoked meats and a big Katz pastrami. 4 stars for moist beef and soft bread."}
{"text":"Literally the best authentic smoked meat sandwich in Montreal. Always get it when I'm traveling there."}
{"text":"Smoked meat galore - you walk to the front window and there's tons of smoked meat just sitting there - right there in the window staring back at you tempting you to come in and try - and try I did. 

Think \"Katz's Delicatessen\" if you've been to New York. The interesting thing is listening to the Jewish workers speak french. We went on a Sunday morning at 10:30am. No wait, not crowded - so what's the hype? My best friend and I ordered one smoked meat sandwich to share. I'm disappointed that you have to pay $1.50 for a pickle (from a jar!!!!) and $1.95 for some coleslaw. The sandwich costs $5.95 CAD or $5.36 USD and that's basically all you get. Two slices of bread and maybe a quarter pound of meat with some Heinz yellow mustard. 

The breakdown of each - the meat (Corned beef or pastrami I think) is really good. Tender with plenty of fat on the edges and you can see the cracked peppercorns. (Dieters be wary). The bread was pretty moist, not stale. We shared it and it was plenty enough for a share. The service is nothing to rave about at all, but seriously, you can tell right away as people just walk in and they're pretty much on their own. We ordered some meat to take home and the counter is pretty much no order, just get up there and cut people and order your meat at about $12.95 CAD / pound. That amount is worth it if you're not going to eat tons of it in one sitting. I took the cold cuts home and I'm eating about four slices a day and still have plenty left over. If I were to go back again, I'd pick up more meat at their take out counter but I'd avoid the sit down service. I did nab a bottle of Montreal steak spice for $4. Pricey, but hey, located on \"the Main\" everything will be pricey. You'll be amazed at how much Eastern European foodstuff you'll see on that street - Saint Laurent. My best suggestion, buy the meat - heat it up and pile it on Fairmont's \"all dressed\" bagel with a dash of dijon and deli mustard. That will do you good.  The meat will not come out the same - fluffy and moist, but still it has good flavor although a bit flat and dried at the ends upon reheat.

As I finish this review, I will be stuffing my mouth with more smoked meat. 

Good for carnivores - bad for you vegetarians."}
{"text":"The best smoked meat I've had in my life! \"Omerger,\" the pastrami to bread ratio is unbelievable.  Perfectly seasoned meat, nice and tender, complimented with their mustard and chili on the side.  Wanted to go back here more than once on our trip but time did now allow.

The meat was so good we ordered another sandwich just to try which was the ham sandwich I believe. It was pretty stellar as well, but not as good as the pastrami.  Also, the fries were amazing..non poutine though!  

I wish I remembered the name of the server, maybe mike but that's a stab in the dark. Everything he recommended was great and his service was awesome.

We got lucky when we arrived on Thursday around noon, there wasn't a wait or a line. Shorty after that however, a line formed quickly and out the door. Worth it, I'd definitely stay in that line if I had to especially if I'm visiting."}
{"text":"I am from NY. Well, I am from NJ, and work in NY. This is based on that.

I like this place. The place is solid. It's a sort of hole in the wall full of tourists that are heeding the advice that \"you must go here.\" Andy wanted me to try it, as she lived in Montreal for many years. She did not say that I must try it. But we were close, and it's kind of a well-known establishment in Montreal. So we went in. 

The place is old school, for sure. The vibe is totally New York, which I like. People are piled in at tables and slamming down millions of calories of food in a very blue collar setting. Totally enjoy the vibe of the place. We were squeezed in where they could fit us. People watching was ok, though it's a small joint and reading the stuff on the walls was just as entertaining. 

We got a sandwich. For me, this is pastrami from a Jewish deli. I know, I know. Everyone is going to say that no, it's different. To me, it tasted more or less the same as a real good pastrami. It's good, it's tasty, gooey, fatty, succulent, etc etc. I am not a big enough red meat fan to say that you absolutely must go here. It was good, the sandwich was good, the experience was good. But I think the hype is a little bit much. I read some of the reviews here and think that some people are out of their minds. Well, I guess I know that some people are out of their minds based on much more than that. But you get the point. 

If you are from the NY area and have eaten pastrami & corned beef all your life, don't go here. You will wonder what the fuss is all about. If that does not describe you, then you should go for it. It will be a really good, reasonably priced, down-to-earth eating experience that you will enjoy for sure. Unless you're a vegetarian. Then go to Fairmount Bagels instead."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches but crazy line."}
{"text":"Good food, well regarded.
We ate at take our next door since there was a long line at the restaurant.

Worth the visit if you're within a half mile."}
{"text":"Schwartz deli is my go to place when I get out of the Pierre Trudeau airport. 

  My mother used to take me here for lunch I'd split a sandwich with my sisters and some fries, nothing beats their warm cuts of meat and trip to flavor town.

 Parking seems to work out okay there's usually a spot on the street and don't forget to use your credit/ debit or cash at the meters, you will get a ticket in Montreal.                     

 I am lucky to say I have yet to experience a huge line or any line for that matter at Schwartz's ! I've always had timing that I sit right down at one of the large tables side by other people, or at the bar, it all works. 

 I order the medium sandwich, my fiancé likes to try the platter, it's pilled high half a fresh loaf sliced rye bread, a plate mounded with the tender smoked meat.

  I always add more of the mustard thats on the table.. success.  We share a fries, and a couple of waters. We have also tried the steak platter as a appetizer  and its good and flavorful, but the great is in the smoked meat sandwich. My sis likes a cherry coke to make her meal complete.

  The customer service is great, I personally like the old school look of the uniforms and the whole inside in itself, posters and framed articles galore! 
 
 I asked the cashier about Celine Dion and ownership, she told me its Renee her husband who shows up now and then, and one time Celine came in and bought the entire restaurant's lunch that day, which is a nice gesture.

  The bathrooms are tiny tiny so I'm sure no big people can use the bathrooms here.

  Remember to bring cash here! They do have an ATM inside, and there are ATM's outside nearby as well, but save yourself the hassle. They also welcome Canadian and American money, both with a Canadian currency outcome.

Of all Smoked meat I've had Schwartz is for sure the best hands down. My fiance is a fan now too. You can't leave or come to Montreal without trying the amazing sandwiches, they have it down and are very consistent in quality.

{"text":"For your quintessential Montreal smoked meat in a deli experience this is about as good as you're going to get in central Montreal.  The place can seem a bit drab but it's been there forever and that adds to the downtown deli experience in my opinion.  This isn't fine dining.  It's smoked meat in a deli.  And these guys do a great job at that."}
{"text":"it's a classic. I hate having to find my way through the tourists, but it beats the other nitrate infused copies everywhere. 

At risk of letting the cat out of the bag, it helps to know the cutter. there are different levels of doneness and dryness and you can tell by the colour of the meat. The right guy will give you the goods if you tip well at the take out counter. if you're eating in, it could be a great day or a mediocre day, but nothing beats the history."}
{"text":"Holy Moses, this is one good sandwich. You can find smoked meat at quite a few places in Montreal, but the rest are just fakers. No one can quite get the fat-to-meat ratio exactly right like Schwartz's! Slap on some mustard and eat it up, Joe!

Some things that others haven't mentioned:
-Service here, while generally good, can be hit or miss. Some servers aren't always pleased with some of the blatantly American tourists (\"Whaddya mean y'all don't have hamburgers?\") and, honestly, I can't blame them. As long as you're not obnoxious, you should get decent service.
-The fries aren't always so good.
-The black cherry soda is called Cott's, and it appears to only be available in Montreal...you can't even find it in Quebec City. If you don't have one, you're missing the full experience at Schwartz's.
-Smoked meat is NOT the same as corned beef or pastrami! It is in a class by itself.
-Seating is sort of Darwinian, but that's part of the fun. If you're looking for private and sexy, you're missing the point and probably shouldn't even set foot in here in the first place. But if you are truly a gastronome of the highest caliber, mangez vous!"}
{"text":"Schwartz's is a staple, a Montreal institution when it comes to smoke meat. When asked where I need to definitely visit when I come to Montreal, 3 out of 4 people listed Schwartz's as one of their options. Does it have food that blows your mind? Probably not. That said, it's a perfectly delicious and unpretentious deli. 

During our visit around 2pm (the lines didn't seem to be out the door by then), my bf and I shared a large plate of smoked meat (you have option of fatty or lean or combo), which came with about 8-10 slices of bread. The meat is dry smoked, yet incredibly tender. And the service was so fast! I think we waited less than 5 minutes to get our order."}
{"text":"I never knew that Montreal had an old Jewish neighborhood around Snowden until my friend reminded me that he lived there as a kid and grew up with Schwartz's and another place called, Pumpernik's (now departed). He wanted to be sure I went and \"kvelled\" over a pastrami (smoked meat?) sandwich. While not an aficionado of most Jewish Deli despite my pedigree, I happily obliged him.

I understand why so many feel the urge to compare Schwartz's to Katz's in Manhattan, however, there is really no need because they are very different is scope and nationality.  Where Katz's gives a broad menu of many J Deli's most famous hits, Schwartz's has a much more limited menu that focuses primarily on their meat sandwiches.  They both have a ton of ethnic atmosphere, and for the People, it feels great to connect with another part of the lost tribes.  Otherwise, the food itself is excellently prepared with an almost Biblical recipe, and is quite tasty.  Certainly worth a trip if you are in Montreal and enjoy fat sandwiches. 

Otherwise, most North American cities have at least one old Jewish Deli that can satisfy your craving for smoked beef on rye.  Schwartz's up in Montreal is on that short list of great pastrami houses (Maison de Pastrami). 

Sooner of later, someone will put together a Yelp List of great P'rami joints and this one will be in the top 3."}
{"text":"I've happened upon an optimal time for Schwartz's: raining, 11pm Friday evening. I was in & out in 5 minutes with my soon-to-be translucent paper bag of hot smoked meat.

The bread in this sam'mich is clearly just a juicy beef delivery device, measuring less than a centimeter in height, just dense enough to provide some grip on the succulent slabs of protein as you direct it into your face.

Staff was courteous, attentive, and spoke perfect English.  The young man behind the counter took the time in between orders to ask the lovely ladies at the closest table how they were liking their choice.

Quick ordering process run-down: you order at the sandwich counter right inside the door, you get a receipt, spin 210 degrees counter-clockwise, pay the man at the till, then take a new paid receipt back to the sandwich counter and receive your sandwich after it's hand cut and assembled with some mustard.

First experience: great.  I'll be back the next time I notice the stars have aligned and there's not 30 people outside waiting for their beef injection."}
{"text":"I really hate to say this, but this place is a bit over-rated. My sandwich was mostly gristle and fat. I had better smokes meats the last time I was in Ottawa. I suspect there are better places in Montreal or, hopefully, these guys just had an off day."}
{"text":"Given the reputation of - apparently - one of the world's best Deli, I had to root out the evil at last. And gosh that tasted like the best smoked meat sandwich I ever had. 

Briefly (because that's what Schwartz is about: come, eat and leave): lovely setting with a friendly, nice and efficient service. I got my sandwich in less than 30 seconds after I ordered it. I also appreciated how focused the deli is as you have only 3 types of sandwiches only. However, I won't crave for their decent but quite common fries.

Money talk: 2 cokes, 2 sandwiches ($6 each) and 1 fries amounted to $21 not including tip. Hey Cramer, get the price right. 

Overall, you will love Schwartz, for both the food and its lively atmosphere and I recommend you go there for a 3 pm lunch."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is rude and they claim it \"should be that way\".  oh nah....."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is my go to place to get 'comfort food' in Montreal. I use the apostrophes because it might not be the most comfy place to enjoy a meal, so just a little heads up for y'all. Try not to come in large groups because it does get very busy everyday around meal times and without doubt you'll be sharing tables with other clients. This is not a big problem for me, but its worth mentioning ;).
Ordering there, you can chose your meat cut as lean, medium, or fatty. For a full-on greasy spoon experience, get the fatty... but for myself/and most ladies, it's a little too much to handle, so I'd recommend the medium. 
Prices rise every year because of the fame, so it does run on the pricier side for a sandwich.
Pay by cash
All in all, one of my favorite spot for a quick meal in town, don't miss out of this!!"}
{"text":"There are some things you go do once. When you go to San Francisco you go see the Golden Gate Bridge, when you're in NYC you get a falafel sandwich, and when you're in Montreal, you try a sandwich at Schwartz's. It's a $10ish sandwich of goodness, often likened to the epic NYC equivalent at Katz deli. It's delicious, it is fast, they serve it to you quick with a can of coke if you like and expect you to get moving. This isn't a place you linger for long. Get your photo, devour (and SHARE) your meal and then get out and enjoy the vintage shops up and down the street."}
{"text":"I went there on my first day in Montreal, as recommended by so many of my non-Montreal friends. I was hungry, so the amount of meat they put in the sandwich was satisfying, but I was honestly a bit disappointed.

It was a decent sandwich; try it if you're curious, but there's nothing particularly special about the taste of this $9 smoked meat sandwich, besides the quantity of meat. I would have added more black pepper and mustard. The seating wasn't particularly comfortable, and the service was a bit chaotic, even though I went at 3pm."}
{"text":"As a tourist, I had to stop by since all my friends were raving about it. I ordered the medium smoked meat sandwich, fries, and coleslaw. Fries and coleslaw were mediocre at best. The smoked meat was thick cut, stacked high, and very tender. However, it's quite pricey for such a small sandwich. 

It's a nice place to check out once but wouldn't go back. I'm sure there are better smoked meat places for cheaper that I can discover."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Had a 40 min wait outside in the heat, but worth the wait. Great service, yummy food -- we had a large plate of brisket with some sides and left feeling very happy and full!"}
{"text":"I don't like smoked meat but this is delicious. Best I've ever had. Dont try to be cool and get lean. It's like ordering low fat iced cream... Just get the good stuff."}
{"text":"So, this place used to be my smoke meat HAVEN! And then.....I went today, for my  fat day...and, i was disappointed. What happened? The meat was soo dry...I asked for a medium sammy and there was an insane amount of fat, not that it was bad, but it wasn't to my liking. Very bland and wanting salt...I couldn't tell the waiters it was bad...they are the sweetest bunch you will ever meet, but it's sad that Schwartz's has come to this. Celine Dion don't know good smoked meat, and now I'm farting up a storm. I guess tourists would like it, but IF YOU'VE HAD IT...LIKE HAD IT....U KNOW IT AIN'T GOOD NO MO...NO MO FO SHO."}
{"text":"My 100th review is truly special! Schwartz's in Montreal is so amazing! A must if you are ever in the city. There's a reason why this business has been around for 80 years and is still popping because of the quality of food that is consistently served. That's right, it's just not any food, it's the BEST smoked meat in Canada. If you're looking for a quick bite that's delicious and savoury, get their smoked meat sandwich. $9.95 for a sandwich is pretty pricey but it's worth it! The meat is smoked for hours so when you take a bite, it literally melts in your mouth with tons of flavour. I like the marinade of the meat and how they use traditonal mustard in the sandwich. The combination just works well. Highly recommended and worth the wait in line. Grab a few pre-packaged meats so you can take some home and pack some sandwiches!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

We opted to get take-out because the line up to dine in is long af! We ordered the smoked meat sandwich - $9.60..4 of them. Two was to bring back home for our family to try. So four of those little sandwiches costed about $44!

I'm not sure if I can say it's worth the money, but the sandwich was good. It's small but it's packed filled with their smoked meat, usually I'm not a fan of deli meat but this one was delicious. But when we were bringing it back to our place, we noticed a lot of oil seeped through the bag. Good to try though!"}
{"text":"Let me save you time: It's the smoked meat sandwich, with a pickle, and a black cherry soda. Number 4 on their board of items to order. That's the thing you get here (and of course, get some poutine) and that's the thing people will ask you if you got here. 

It's incredibly, wildly popular here. Which doesn't coordinate well with the teeny interior. There is precious little seating, so unless you luck out on a rainy day and arrive with no waiting for a single seat at the bar (but a nearly full house otherwise) at 11:25am, you're going to wait. By the time I left at noon, there was a monstrous line out the door and down the sidewalk. 

If you've made it past those two paragraphs up there, I should also indicate that there's a massive menu here and I feel kind of bad giving you the same tourist info that is undoubtedly on many websites and traveler books. Yes, this is what you get. But it seems like if I were to come back and really dive into the menu, I could find some things that are real treasures. The fellas next to me came in and ordered something entirely different; one was a local and the other visiting, trusting his judgment. Indeed, the menu is actually pretty large.

I delighted in that sandwich, was totally happy to have also ordered poutine, and it was a totally wonderful and pleasant meal. The bread, the mustard, the pastrami; it's hearty stuff and stacked high. Currently it's around $10 for the sandwich, and I was out of there for less than $20 with the poutine. 

Be aware that it's cash only. There's an ATM a few doors down, and they were super patient as I asked directions. The whole staff, in fact, was patient with my questions. Incredibly kind and tolerant. I'm sure I asked the same questions that they're asked a hundred times daily, but they were nice in answering, prompt in service, and got me in and out quick--but not too quickly.

You have to get the smoked meat sandwich. Start there. You have to, at least once. Then go back and really explore what else they do."}
{"text":"Mythical place on St Laurent. Also, holy. Do not enter: just observe the flock.
Just kidding. Not even good, just a place for tourists. It's okay. Just observe."}
{"text":"We ordered our sandwiches to go, and when they handed me the little rolled up  sandwiches, my thoughts were, \"Really? This is it? Should I order another one?\" Then when I unwrapped it, my thoughts were, \"Hmmm, the slices of bread are so small! How will this hold up to the meat?\" And then, I took a bite and my thoughts were, \"Mmmmm, Nom NOm NOM.\" The meat really was tender and juicy and flavorful. And though I picked the fat off, it was hard to because it was so... gooey, and melty. The bread portion was perfect. However, I would not recommend the fries, they were greasy and just... not their specialty. Stick with the meat. Oh, and YES, the one sandwich really filled me up! My husband even had to save some of his for later because it was that filling!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why it's been in business for over 80 years! You have to eat here if you ever get a chance to visit Montreal. Been here 3 times at it's just as delicious as the first. 

Get the smoked meat sandwich and ask for medium fat. You can get less fat or more fat, but in between is where the money's at. It's piled on top of rye bread and topped with mustard. I never liked mustard until I had it with some Schwartz's smoked meat! The poutine is just as delicious - the perfect side. 

If you have a large group forget about getting a table without a long wait. 2 or less is ideal for dining in because you'll likely get a counter seat, but we still had a 20 minute wait at 1pm on a Saturday. We've been in and out in under 16 minutes, and in that amount of time you'll be sufficiently satisfied!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here on Yelp, I felt prepared for my pilgrimage to Schwartz's. I turned up around 11:30 and was amazed there wasn't a line. Inside was plenty busy, but there were a few tables still open and seating at the counter. I squeezed into a seat here, between two gentlemen, and stared in amazement at the mountains of smoked meat waiting to be sliced for sandwiches--we're talking kilos and kilos of beef encrusted in Schwartz's special spices.

\"Parlez-vous Anglais?\" I asked the gentleman on my left. \"Yes,\" was the reply in a suspiciously American accent. I then asked if the counter guy would come back to take my order, or if there was some arcane process that wasn't obvious. He said the guy would be back to take my order and we struck up a conversation. It turns out Tim was originally from Dallas, but had been living in Montreal for about 17 years. He was already halfway through his lunch of a medium-fat smoked meat sandwich and fries. He recommended I also order the medium-fat, as the lean is too dry and some don't like the full-fat version. I followed Tim's suggestion and ordered a med-fat.

When it arrived, the sandwich was a little smaller than I'd anticipated. But then I had to remind myself I wasn't in the good ol' mega-sized U.S. of A. anymore--and it was too big for me to finish anyway. The smoked meat was piled thick between two slices of a white-type bread (not sourdough, and not rye) and garnished with a bit of plain yellow mustard. The meat tasted like corned beef but not as salty, and there was just a hint of smoke to it. Tim said that he's not really sure why it's called smoked meat, because it's primarily steamed. Regardless, it was good, but I think I would have preferred the full-fat cuts. I noticed that by the time I was nearing the end of my meal, the meat had cooled and had definitely become a bit dry.

So, I'm glad I made it to this shrine to smoked meats, but I think once was enough to satisfy my curiosity. And my arteries thank me."}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal we had an opportunity to experience the much raved about smoked meat sandwich here, more akin to corned beef than pastrami and not even close to the product sold at Katz's  in New York. We ordered the medium fat version , which was dry , so maybe the fattier version would be better, but beyond that it wasn't particularly flavorful or smoky. Everything is ala carte,  no pickles on the table.  But the prices are very reasonable . We had a half sour and cole slaw, a sweet vinegar type which was excellent and good French fries, even though I am not a fan generally. The line on a Tuesday night was not that long and we only waited a few minutes at around 7 pm they weren't busy. Mile End in NY is a better take on this style of deli. It was a sad day for us , and I hate to write this negative review our  expectations were really destroyed as we love deli. Also cash only too."}
{"text":"During my trip to Montreal, I wanted to try all of the well-known eateries, one of them being Schwartz's. I have read the reviews about the long lines, luckily, we went during a weekday at about 3pm, where we easily picked a seat and received instant service. If you don't want to wait in a line, go at an off peak time! 

Our waiter was very nice and went through the menu with us. The smoked meat sandwich is the only meat that they cook in-house. I have tried many NY deli sandwiches and this was definitely up there.

It is a no-frills kind of place, but sometimes that is just what you want. Get a pickle, a smoked meat sandwich and some slaw (which has a lighter vinegar dressing, rather than a thick creamy one), and you are set!"}
{"text":"Already so much as been said about Schwartz's - I won't dwell too long on it.
Just stay clear of peak hours, its a nightmare to wait in line for food like that.
I've been there twice only because it takes some time to get the food and it's not cheap at all. But it's worth it to at least try once! 

You can choose between different fattiness levels of the meat, which is nice."}
{"text":"The smoke meat live up with its reputation! We love it! Their poutine was not that good though. The waiter was nice and friendly, but he should have recommended us what to order, since we ordered the food individually and it was not as good as ordering a big plate to share. If you go there with your friends, then you should totally ordered the smoke meat plate so you all can share. The liver steak was great too"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge meat person but I loooooved my sandwich!!! I had the turkey sandwich which had mustard on it. The meat was soft and delicious and the bread was fresh. We also ordered fries which were amazing. The amount of meat on the sandwich was too much for me so I took some out for later"}
{"text":"The smoked beef is amazing. We Los tried the steak and roasted chicken which are equally amazing. Highly recommend to grab a seat at the bar so you could ask the waiters questions."}
{"text":"Since the disappearance of Ben's, this is the last remaining of the original smoked meat restaurants. The Dunn's of the world are just all dolled up with glitz. If you want true quality and how these sandwiches ought to be, this is the only place."}
{"text":"Smoked meat smoked meat and smoked meat. Simple,Delicious And paired with a fanta. Service is friendly and fast. Place itself is nothing to rave about, but with good food and people who cares? They are cash only, but there's an ATM close by"}
{"text":"Mind annnnnnnd stomach blowing! The smoked meat sandwich is the best ice ever had. Just like everyone else has stated... Medium, and a cherry coke are the thing to order."}
{"text":"After fighting traffic and circling the block around three times we finally found a spot and made it into Schwartz's for one of their signature sandwiches and it was not a disappointment. The next time I am just going to take the Metro and save myself the pain of parking.  

I first visited there back in the 80's and have been back every time I visit Montreal. This is a meat lovers dream and I have yet to find a place like it in Massachusetts. Maybe that's a good thing.. 

 The sandwiches are packed with their tender savory smoked meat and I generally don't mess around with the sides like the french fries. I can get those anywhere but the steak and smoked meat are just great.  You have to be ready to take you time and go through the menu and deal with the crowd because it's always busy. TIP: get the coleslaw and pickle with your sandwich...!"}
{"text":"Home sweet home - authentic, tradition, heritage, comfort...YUM!!
This is the home of 'montreal smoked meats' - this will be worth waiting in line - its been here 80 years - speaks for itself! I love my deli - and always bring the troops here for the regular traditional visit when in town.
This landmark has been a staple for many - a must visit when in montreal!! (hits the spot  when hung-over after Jazz Fest - haa haa!)
www.schwartzsdeli.com for photos and history"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to a truly world-famous place. I brought my son at about 1830 on a Fri eve; 15-minute wait was tolerable. So was table sharing. 

The smoked meat is always a revelation. Unfortunately, our plate contained a lot of fat; though I am beginning to believe fat is beloved by Montreal diners. The rye bread and fries were excellent. The other sides were special, too; half-sour pickle, hot peppers, vinegar cole slaw. We spent about $27 CAD for a large meat plate, fries, peppers, slaw, and pickle.

Mile End Deli in Brooklyn is as good, and maybe better."}
{"text":"The ambiance is amazing... crowded, loud and memorable of an era gone by. One can imagine eating in this diner in a Jewish neighborhood in the mid 20th century. The wall-art is reminiscent of how many years this smoked meat shop has been around.
Quebecois differentiate smoked meat from what we'd call pastrami in the US. I would say smoked meat is a lot less pepper crusted. I ordered the medium fatty cut, and it was pretty amazing. The fries were decent, and barely needed to complement the sandwich, mustard and pickle on the side. I can see why Schwartz's beats out Katz's from time to time. A must visit in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Super tasty smoked meat sandwiches & PICKLES (Yes that needs to be all capslock).
Standing in line is less fun but it goes pretty swift & the service is great.

You have to go here when you visit Montreal, you can't say you've been to Montreal if you haven't gone to Schwartz's...it's essential. 
If you live here: congrats on being able to eat tasty smoked meat ALL THE TIME."}
{"text":"This place is nothing to look at! Be prepared to wait at least an hour outside. Cash only! Way better than ANY NYC deli for Corned Beef. At Schwartz's it is called 'Smoked Meat'. Get it on a plate with bread on the side. You will NOT be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"After wandering about the city for a few hours, I'd worked up quite the appetite and, thanks to numerous recommendations, knew exactly where I needed to go to satisfy it. When we arrived, the line of fifteen people outside of the deli simply reinforced the importance of visiting for a taste of Schwart's smoked meats. Thankfully, Jeremy K noticed a foursquare tip about the smaller extension, Schwartz's À Côté, which saved us a great deal of time. We ordered, ate, and left before the people waiting ahead of us had even made it into the larger restaurant.

Heeding the advice of many, I ordered a smoked meat sandwich and a cherry soda. Almost instantaneously, we received our sandwiches, which were stuffed with much more meat than the bread could support and topped with a bit of yellow mustard. The meat was tender and flavorful, Schwartz's secret blend of herbs and spices complementing the brisket's natural flavor without overwhelming it. The mustard added a subtle kick that kept the focus on the meat while also introducing a bit of diversity to this meal. From the first bite, it is clear why this place has developed its reputation, and the value found in each overstuffed sandwich served to enhance my experience further."}
{"text":"Legendary, yes. Great vibe, yes. Service is top notch. Definitely a must visit but...the food is only OK. Had a smoked meat, turkey sandwich as well as the fires. The fries and turkey are not worth ordering. The turkey is no better than supermarket deli turkey. The smoked meat is good, mine was both dry and too fatty at the same time if that is even possible. I might go back if in the area, but no more 20$ uber rides from downtown to go there."}
{"text":"My mouth waters when I think about this place. In my mind, the traditional smoked meat sandwich here is probably the best in North America (in the NY vs. Montreal battle). If you're a tourist, you have to stop by this place! I grabbed it to go and I love the sandwich's triangular shape. Love it."}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant not the smash hit musical!

This is the real deal.  Best smoked meat sandwich I've ever had.  Friendly server and old school charm.  Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Schwart's is mixed experience for me.

The good

- The meal is fulfilling
- The cherry coke compliments the meal
- The waiter had a sense of humor

The fortunate
- There was an ATM nearby when I realized they only take cash

The could have been better
- Everyone ordered medium fat smoked meat sandwich. But some had more fat than the other
- The waiter was initially quite intimidating, probably cuz he tried to uphold the policy of 'only take order when the table is complete'
- The coleslaw. Let just say all the love was put into the smoked meat and no love was put in there.

Final verdict: Would bring my dad to try it one day because he loves a good chunk of meat. But wouldn't bring someone that I'm trying to impress. It's an interesting place to try once, but not to return on a cold night."}
{"text":"I tried this for a late dinner today because I wanted to see what all the hype was about...
I'll say the famous scwartz sandwich is good but not to die for... Every city has a must go to stop like sprinkles in LA. 
If I lived in Montreal I would be back again for lunch. 
I recommend skipping the lines and ordering take out, it saves you the gigantic line.
Medium sandwich without drink is $7.01 Canadian dollars.

The dried meat is juicy, tender, seasoned amazingly and delicious."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of smoke meat but I had to go here because it's the place for smoke meat. It was ok. But I wouldn't go again"}
{"text":"I used to go to Schwartz every week when I was younger because it was simply the best smoked meat in Montreal.

I had not been since the ownership changed because I thought they might ruin it lol Well I was wrong aside from all the prices pretty much doubling it remains the best smoked meet in town. So yes if you come to Montreal you need to go to Schwartz :-)"}
{"text":"Historic and famed location for your sandwich meats cravings in the centre of Montréal. And it's one hell of a place. There're are plenty of reviews (not just on Yelp) regarding this place and for for what I experienced, it was pretty damn good. Perfectly cured, prepared, cooked and dished out coupled with a can of cold soda, this place can turn a humid, blistering afternoon into one refreshing, stomach bursting adventure.

Pretty much everything on the menu is good. I didn't get everything but I got a wide cross section of their offerings. Just eat the meat as the bread will just slow you down. I found the liver to be just ok so unless you're a huge fan of it, I'd suggest sticking to their famed meats and sandwiches. When in doubt, ask the waiter but be quick about your decision.

Few things that I have to speak on that's not food related but will affect your visit here. First off, if you're driving here, you're going to have one hell of a time finding a parking spot. Be prepared to park a few blocks away and make sure it's ok. The markings are unclear and confusing at best and if parked in the wrong place, you'll get a ticket or worse yet, get towed. When in doubt, go into a store nearby and ask the worker there for some parking tips as they should be familiar with the area. Most people on the streets are either assholes who refuse to talk to you or just as clueless as you are. Second, the wait is long. And when I say long, it can go up to two hours. My cousin stood in line 45 mins before we arrived and we waited another 45 mins after we found parking and walked over to where he was standing in line. I do not suggest groups of more than 4. You will not find a table together unless you want to wait over 2 hours. Third, it's really crowded in here. You'll be sitting close to your neighbors so be prepared to be engaged in some friendly chatter with your seatmate. Lastly, order everything at once. Because it's so busy and super crowded, the waiters will be very difficult to flag down so when you sit down, look at the menu, agree on what you'd want and just order everything at once. Side note: it's be a plus if you spoke French and you'll get some bonus points for attempting it if you're a non-Québécois. 

Parking: Metered street and very limited
Price: $15 per person
Wait: 45-1:30 just to get seated"}
{"text":"I don't think the smoked meat quite comes up the level of Katz's or Second Ave, Deli in NYC, but it's darn close.  And, as Josh P. mentioned, the prices are substantially lower than those establishments.  You can order your meat fatty, lean or medium - and it comes the way you order it. There was a line on Monday night but it moved fairly quickly.
The inside decor leaves a little to be desired and unless you're a party of 6 or 8 you're going to be sharing a table with what my granddaughter would call, \"Friends I haven't met yet.\"
Our waiter was friendly, professional and prompt.
The decor and the seating arrangements might normally cause me to rate a restaurant like this at three stars but the food is so good that it demands four.
This is a definite first night in Montreal stop for us.  And if we're here for more than a few days,  it requires a second visit."}
{"text":"Finally came here after lots of my coworkers asked me. Finally got it and it was an ok piece of smoked meats sandwich but nothing special."}
{"text":"I am from NY & last Summer I came to visit was my first time here so had to come back this trip.  So delicious! Yes there is always a line, yes it's worth it.  I waited about 25 minutes for the take out line.  Super fast service they had the smoked meats sandwiches ready to go & in brown bags but it was still warm and delicious! Highly recommend if you love meats!"}
{"text":"They have Montreal smoked meat that is out of this world . Get ready to be harassed a bit but it's all part of the experience. If you can give it- they'll give back! Must see Montreal institution. You've have experienced Montreal unless you been to Schwartz's. If you like corned beef or pastrami this is your place. Kosher Coke available as well. Meaning they have real Coke in the bottle. Check this place out. It's worth an Uber ride!"}
{"text":"Everyone has a review of this place.  I can't say I was disappointed, but I can say it didn't live up to the hype and expectation.  After waiting over an hour we finally sat.  The corned beef is delicious, but you better love your fat, it isn't trimmed.  In addition the sandwiches are small.  A tasty meal, but I've had much better deli in New York and Philly."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the trip! Luckily, we arrived when the line wasn't too long, but as we left, there was a long wait. This is a CASH only establishment. The waiter was very friendly; we ordered what they're known for- smoked meat with mustard, pickles and cherry peppers. The poutine is very good! It's a tourist place, but I would definitely say to check it out at least once if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The place is a bit small and there's usually a wait which isn't a terrible thing since the meat is delicious. One of the best places to come if you live here or are visiting from afar. You might be sharing your table with strangers and if they're open to chat it makes the experience much more enjoyable. The pastrami sandwich was delicious and they give a good amount of meat that makes it a bit difficult to eat. The pickle was what won me over, perfectly crunchy and the right salty. :)"}
{"text":"There was a long line at 10 pm. Definitely worth the wait. I ordered the smoke meat. The first bite was so heavenly. Smoked chicken and coleslaw were quite unique. It was fun to talk to the servers and locals about Montreal and the food. Overall, This is quite good!"}
{"text":"It's a good sandwich, and yeah - the side of pickle, fries and cherry coke is awesome, but it's not worth standing in line for (especially it the weather is not great!). Do yourself a favour and try another spot if you: a) plan on hanging out and not just eat and leave; b) want to pay by credit card; c) want beer.  Across the street you may find 'the main' which is equally good and will satisfy all of the above."}
{"text":"Katz spoiled me. Also my toes almost froze off waiting outside for about an hour.

Decor/Ambiance 3.5/5
- This place sure has true delicatessen feel to it. Big chunks of meat are visible from the outside. The inside sits a limited amount of people (hence the wait. Don't come on the weekend to dine in, or at least order out). It felt a bit cramped.

Service- 5/5
- Food came out super fast as soon as we sat and ordered. Despite how busy it was, the guys were efficient and eager to take second orders/ modifications.

Food- 2/5
- Being from New York, Katz has set the bar ridiculously high for smoked meat sandwiches. Schwartz doesn't come close. This is not to say that its smoked meat sandwich is bad; it is decent. But decent is simply that- just decent. Also the black cherry coke was average. It doesn't help that this place is so hyped up- my expectations were too high. 


Bottom line- may be worth a tourist visit in the middle of  a weekday."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. Came in late one night to try the famous blah blah blah and instead left with my friend insulted and feeling pressured into giving a big tip for (pretty slow) counter service!

The smoked meat sandwich was bland. Just a big pile of bland and old meat, which had clearly been reheated and was now dry and stringy. The fries were, actually, pretty good. The cherry soda, also pretty good in combination with the other things. But in the end it was not worth it.

The uncomfortable part started when we sat down and the guy behind the counter asked us where we were from. My friend is from Vietnam, and once the counter guy heard that he started going off on how \"I bet you're from south Vietnam\" and talking about how he knows the whole story, and basically recounting a poor History Channel summary of the Vietnam War from some documentary he watched. Thanks, but my friend already knows. Then he mentioned something about Asians taking jobs, and wouldn't stop talking about Vietnam until I completely changed the subject.

While we were waiting for the check I hear one of the guys brag about how he just scammed the guy sitting next to us out of 10 dollars by saying he \"didn't have any change\" and then he pressured us into giving him a higher tip too. We just wanted to leave at that point.

Yeah the fries were good but maybe go somewhere else where you can get a sandwich that tastes good as well, without the other sh*t."}
{"text":"Vous recherchez un resto à la réputation surfaite, où l'on attend en ligne dehors pour entrer, même à moins 10 degrés ? Vous rêvez de manger un smoked meat très ordinaire, à la viande un peu sèche ? Vous souhaitez prendre place dans un endroit un peu ringard pour ne pas dire un peu crasseux ? Alors, faites partie de la légende en vous rendant chez Schwartz's. Un endroit mythique à Montréal dont je ne comprends pas encore ce qui a fait sa réputation et fait courir autant les foules. Désolé auprès des inconditionnels, de Céline et de René, mais j'ai connu mieux en smoked meat."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge smoked meat person in general, but when I really want some delicious meat in my mouth I turn to Schwartz's. A friend had the genius idea to stop there for a simple dinner so we dropped by and grabbed the last spots, sharing a table with two gentlemen visiting from Quebec City. I had the trusted \"medium\" sandwich, a pickle, and a black cherry soda. This is a combination that never does me wrong. If I was able to eat more I'd have had some fries, too. But let's not forget the star of the show - the smoked meat! Medium fatty is a good level of juiciness for me without overwhelming the flavor of the meat. It's well seasoned, tender, and probably the best in the city."}
{"text":"This is a piece of Montreal history, it is hard to explain this place to Vancouverites because there really has been nothing like it here. It is a bit of New York style deli, Chicago diner and French and Jewish picnic eats. It has stayed the same since it opened, Al Capone used to eat there when he was whisky smuggling, the old guys behind the counter have pictures of them when they where in their twenties on the wall, and there there is the sandwich. Just look at the pictures because it doesn't matter how I describe it. I will just say, Cherry Cott and sandwich and fries, or pickle, that's it, that's all. GO THERE when you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Classic spot! They define Montreal smoked meat. We had the simple smoked meat sandwich and dill pickle. Bring your appetite because they pack on the meat!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that makes grown men cry.  When we arrived, the wait was not too bad, shortly after we arrived the line got really long though.  The staff was friendly and welcoming, even joked around with us!  It was awesome, even though the place is small, we was able to squeeze 11 guys in!

This is the best smoked meat I had when in Montreal, maybe even ever..  the meat was so succulent and flavorful!  I enjoyed the medium fat more than the lean fat, I felt like it was more juicy and flavorful.  Some of the guys did half and half and thought it was perfect.  I did a sandwich and the guys did a large plate of meat to share.  Both are easily enjoyable, just don't forget to wash it down with the black cherry soda!

I would come back to Montreal just for this!"}
{"text":"As someone who is less than enthusiastic about sandwiches and meat, I was thankful I came as Schwartz definitely lives up to the hype.

I ordered the classic smoked meat sandwich with a side of coleslaw. Unbeknownst to us, you can actually select how fatty you would like your meat to be (I recommend medium). The lean meat is nicely smoked, while the fatty meat add a great texture. Despite being a simple sandwich, you will leave stuffed with the amount of meat they stuff in there. I was not the biggest fan of the coleslaw however; I would have preferred a mayonnaise based dressing rather than a vinegar base as it was a tad bit too sour. I would suggest a pickle instead."}
{"text":"Two thin pieces of bread, trying to keep together an over-the-top amount of juicy smoky delicious meet. This meet has been properly marinated in garlic, peppers and spices before it was smoked. You can gawk at the huge pieces  lying in the vitrine while you are waiting at the constant line up outside (even when it's -30). Schwartz is an institution that tracks back to the 20's of the last century. The owners changed but they are still making the meat by the same recipe Schwartz brought with him when he immigrated from Romania. A real local will order it with a pickle and cream soda. Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"The classic smoked meat deli in Montreal. It was fantastic! Of course, I ordered the smoked meat sandwich. It was DELICIOUS. Even the pickle on the side was amazing. Limited menu, but they do it right!

There isn't much seating, it's a small place not meant for large groups. The service is quick and I was impressed the constant changing of hungry to satisfied customers.

If you visit Montreal, you owe it to yourself and tastebuds to come here."}
{"text":"Skip the long line and get take out.  The smoke meat sandwich is smaller than most places but filled with delicious smoked meat.  For me, it was the perfect portion for a light meal.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, even more than some NYC delis."}
{"text":"If it were up to my husband, he'd probably give Schwartz's 5 stars, because he has been talking about smoked meat days before we arrived in Montreal. But I am less of a carnivore than he is, so I am a bit more reserved with my stars. 

Arriving at the door was exciting, because you can't see the inside, but there is always a line outside the door, looking like eager folks trying to get inside an exclusive club. However, the line moves quickly, and soon we find ourselves sitting at the counter ordering sandwiches as fast as we can because we only fed the parking meter for half an hour not knowing how this Schwartz's trip will turn out. 

To be different and also being genuinely afraid of the amount of meat between those itsy-bitsy slices of rye bread (oh yeah, the minute you walk in, you see everyone holding that giant meaty thing in their hand), I ordered a turkey sandwich. Not to be outdone by the smoked meat sandwich, there were about 30 slices of turkey on two little slices of bread that barely could hold the meat. 

I tried some of the smoked meat and it was really good! I can't even describe it, because it doesn't necessarily taste smokey, and the meat is not saucy like slow cooked beef, or dry and shreddy like pulled pork. It's tender and chewy at the same time, on the verge of falling apart but not mushy. 

I guess you will just have to come and try it yourself. It was a really fun thing to do on our trip."}
{"text":"This is the GO-TO place if you want to eat Montreal smoked meat! I'm not kidding! 

Smoked meat: 5 stars
Service & wait: 1 star
Decor: 1 star

Be prepared for long waits, sit in communal table with tight spaces, and little to minimal service.

You can choose various fatness of your smoked meat ~ lean, medium, fatty.  I didn't know I could specify after I ordered, oh well, it's good enough with me. I was already satisified with my warm, tender meat served on a fresh rye bread with mustard ($6.65). Next time I'll definitely try the kill-me-fatty option! LOL.

A nice surprise was the cherry coke. I'm never a fan of artificial cherry products, but since almost every table ordered this, so why not give it a try. Oh, It was AMAZING!!! It completely changed my perceptions of all cherry drinks tasted like cough syrup. It was addictive, and a perfect companion of the fatty smoked meat.

Tips: 
- There is a minimum order of $1.50 per person.
- Take out smoked meat (cold) is $1.00 cheaper per pound if you can heat it up yourself at home.
- Go there before 12noon to avoid huge lineups!
- Cash only."}
{"text":"fell off a bit. still worth visiting as a first introduction to smoked meat or if you're near the main, but there's some good smoked meat at more reasonable prices elsewhere in the city. still very good though."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you must try in Montreal.
So sure, you will be queuing outside for a while and yes you will be seated at a cramped table with unknown people next to you but hey that's part of the experience! (lock your asocial self away for an hour, it will be worth it!)
Get the smoked meat sandwich and whatever else you fancy. Take picture and look in your neighbours' plates (don't drool, they don't like it!). Eat and watch the waiters run around as if every sandwich was important (but it is, right?!)
Then leave, full and smiling of what you just achieved! Be proud, you managed to eat at Schwartz's!"}
{"text":"If you are visiting Montreal, never miss this spot. Initially, I was surprised by the huge line up in front of the place but eventually I realized why they are so popular. 
We ordered smoked meat and smoked turkey. The smoked meat was phenomenal. You can order lean, medium or fatty. The fat adds to the flavor and makes it even better. The meat is so tasty and flavorful, and the sandwich will fill you up. The prices are decent as well. 
I highly recommend stopping by if you are visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Horrible atmosphere.  Long lines.  Fast but unfriendly service.  Somewhat expensive for what you get.

These days, other restaurant can match Schwartz's quality of smoke meat.  But Schwartz's remains the gold standard."}
{"text":"5 stars for the history and the ambiance that sticked through the years!! Very good smoked meat, with hearty portions, and great service!! The prices are very reasonable as well, overall a great experience to eat Montreal's speciality!! Don't pay attention to the front of the building, get in and Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Love it as usual. Just ignore the service since they have so many clients everyday..."}
{"text":"When visiting a large city, you have to stop in at the best Jewish Deli for a corned beef sandwich.  Schwartz's is just that.  Split a corned beef ( they call it brisket)  a couple of half dills, and cole slaw with Lori for an afternoon snack.  Both of us were very happy and rated the corned beef an 8+.  Try to get there at an off time or early.  There aren't many seats and there was a line out the door when we first walked past.  We hit it at about 3:30 on the way back on a Sunday afternoon and walked right."}
{"text":"Schawrtz's is still a bit overrated in my opinion.  It's good, but it isn't THAT good if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"I realize this is very much hyped -- a stop for every tourist, hence the long (but fairly quick-moving lines).  But it was worth it and for me, lived up to the hype.  I braved the take-out line.  It was about 30 people deep when I joined and we got up there in about 40 minutes.  They didn't ask me what level of fattiness I wanted and I'm pretty sure I ended up with a medium fatty sandwich, with one side fattier than the other.  It was divine -- it was fall off the (non-existent) bone perfect, perfectly balanced with mustard seeds and pepper.  I know other reviewers said it's large enough for two, but I happily ate my whole sandwich and am very glad I kabashed my husband's suggestion that we share a sandwich.  I do wish I'd nabbed some more mustard to add to my sandwich.  On the side, I had a plump perfect pickle which cut through the fattiness of my delicious sandwich just perfectly.  Strange that the menu had both pickles and sour pickles, but we were told they are one and the same!  

I didn't think that given the quality of the food, it was overpriced.  A little under $10 for a sizeable and truly spectacular, world-renowned sandwich and $2 for a truly massive pickle seemed reasonable to me, though being from DC, perhaps I'm simply used to being overcharged.  

There were benches in a sidewalk public patio half a block up from the restaurant where my friends and I giddily chomped down on our sandwiches and pickles.  I couldn't be happier, though the lunch did make me a little groggy and ready for a nap!"}
{"text":"In Montreal, this place is like a mini Katz deli of NYC. They call their signature meal smoke meat. It's a cross between brisket and pastrami and it's delicious. Priced right, it's about half of what you would pay at the famous delis in NYC. To make it perfect, they need to add half sour pickles and real deli spicy brown mustard versus just yellow. That is the only thing in the way of 5 stars. Oh yes and this is cash only which is inconvenient and they need to get with that program. I can't imagine getting anything better outside of NYC."}
{"text":"Totally overrated.  If you've had Pastrami in NYC or SF this place will be a huge let down.

However, the staff were very friendly and NOT rude (Lonely Planet gets it wrong AGAIN)."}
{"text":"Not just the best smoked meat. The ONLY smoked meat. Never change.

People have been ordering smoked meat, medium, fries, pickle, and black cherry for  80 years for a reason. Don't order lean. You're having a smoked meat sandwich - who do you think you're fooling?"}
{"text":"Very good but overhyped. I'd suggest to anyone that's going to Montreal to check it out for the overall experience however it is basically the commercial smoked meat shop of Montreal. I had way better smoked meat in my bagel at St. Viateur bagel shop."}
{"text":"Excellent smoked meat, bien épicé, parfois un peu sec.
Atmosphère bon enfant. Choix de boissons à revoir et améliorer."}
{"text":"Ok, so the meat is good, the atmosphere is funky ... but what freak is going on with the \"lady\" at the checkout ?!

Going to pay the bill and she insists on on the tip : \"you have to pay it, are you gonna do it here or give to the waiter ?\" I know what a tip is, Ma'am and the waiter does deserve it ... but damn, not you !

So I decide to give the tip to the waiter, we put on our coats, get ready to leave, I have the tip in my hand and I'm heading the the waiter when I hear behind me that lovely lady : \"Hey, did they give you the tip ?\" The waiter looks as bothered as I'm surprised ! Damn woman, what's wrong with you ?! I'm gonna give you all my money don't worry !

So, tip the guys, we go out and we won't go back in there, end of story ! Plenty of other smoked meat place in Montreal !"}
{"text":"A bite from our full experience review - 
\"If you must have their Smoked Meats, grab them for take-out an enjoy them elsewhere. This place just made them all taste sour.\""}
{"text":"Ummm... I assume majority of these yelpers have never been to Katz deli in NYC. That place is set up very similar but 6 times as big with longer lines... Maybe the yelpers hyped it up. I was very disappointed. My boyfriend wanted to order 2 sandwiches and we're glad we ordered only 1 after taken the first bite. The meat was DRY even though it was fatty. The meat didn't melt in your mouth like others described. I thought the $7.95 was cheap for a \"famous\" sandwich of Montreal. Yes, the cherry coke, fries and 1/2 sour pickle does go well but the sandwich itself failed!!!

If you like this place, please try Katz. It's about $17 for a sandwich but it's well worth it. The taste and texture is so much better!"}
{"text":"Always visit Schwartzs when visiting Montreal. This time, around 2am, just before they were closing and minimal lineups. There are two Schwartzs restaurants side by side, one for takeout only and one with a few seats.

The smoked meat sandwich is what they are known for and what we always order, with a cherry soda on the side.

Delicious."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat deli. Not a lot of varietyof meat  but I can live with corned beef. Expect a wait line whe. U get there but totally worth the wait compare to NY deli which overly salted. Will visit again when I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by stating that I HATE tourist traps. But, it was pretty late, and a lot of the places we would normally have eaten at were closed. There was no lineup and I hadn't been to Schwartz's in a while so we decided to go in. We were seated right away, which was cool, because we were starving.

I'm not a huge smoked meat guy, but as far smoked meat goes, this place is very good. If I have one complaint, it's that there was a bad smell in the place last night. I'm guessing it was an anomaly, or at least I hope it was.

I'm giving it 3 stars in general, but in the smoked meat category, I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"My best smoke meat in town, tinny and a bit noisy but service is great, I go there since many years and if you like Leavers, they have amazing ones"}
{"text":"Not more needs to be said about this place.  We had a great lunch.  Schwartz's has a NY deli feel.  Expect to share a table with strangers.  We had a nice conversation with our \"lunch neighbors\" while we ate.

On to the food; the smoked meat sandwich is very good.  The pickles and fries are also what you would expect.  Personally, we liked the smaller portion sizes (smaller than a typical New York deli where one order can feed two people).  You couldn't say that the sandwiches were small.  We both left full and happy."}
{"text":"I love this old deli.  There was a line outside with people waiting to be seated at 8:45 pm on a Thursday night in Montreal!  

I realized after waiting in line for 10 minutes that I could just go inside if I wanted to buy something to go.  So I waited inside at a shorter line -- behind the counter where two gents. cut the meat and prepare the sandwiches -- they have the original classic smoked meat and added turkey and chicken.

I order an original smoked meat sandwich to go -- about C$11 (U.S. $8).  I got it back to my hotel room and stuffed the smoke meat down my throat -- oh, it was heavenly.   Now I can cross Schwartz's off my bucket list.  (I prefer the NYC stuff -- maybe I grew up eating them as a youth.)."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich is simple, but oh-so-tasty. A true treat for the palate!"}
{"text":"There are reviews I make where I'm incredulous over how people can rate something over one star, and then there are restaurants where my mind boggles over how anyone could not give them five.  Schwartz's is thankfully the latter.

I'm going into snob mode for this, in order to compel those who are on the fence about whether they should come here or not, to do so.  You absolutely must, since this is one culinary experience I think everyone should have before they die.

First off, if you're going to fret about calories or healthiness, don't bother reading beyond this point, and don't bother eating here.

Second, know that the meat here is so good, all other regular restaurant rating criteria considerations are rescinded.  Do not let the lack of fancy decor, the occasionally less than personal (but often awesome, and never rude) service, the long line-ups, or the cramped, shared tables prevent you from eating here.

So, what you should do:

- If you haven't had anything here before, get the smoked meat (bread - optional, fries - optional, black cherry or diet black cherry cola or beverage of choice - optional, it won't matter what you have with this, anything good winds up complementing the meat, anything bad throws it's awesomeness further into relief).

- Order it only one of the following ways:  medium-fatty, fatty, or, as I usually request, super-extra-fatty (i.e. give me a bit of meat with my fat!).  Do not let health concerns get in the way of this, do not let peer pressure or shame get in the way of this, do not let armed killer robots get in the way of this.  The fat literally melts in your mouth.  You WILL have the tastiest liquid fat known to man dripping into the bread, onto your hands, down your chin, into your shirt...

- Bring cash, and come on off hours, in the middle of the afternoon or as soon as they open, lest you die as the heavenly smell fills you to bursting while you wait in the interminable line.  Don't bring weapons, because you'll use them, and then you'll go to prison, and the only way you'll be able to eat here again is to sell your body to someone to smuggle it in for you.

- By all means, get take-out if you don't want to eat there (again, where you eat it does not make any difference, in the restaurant, at home, in the street, meandering through rush hour traffic), but if you do, order it from the restaurant proper, not the special \"Take-out\" side next door, it's not going to be the same unless you take it home and plunk it into a professional steamer for six hours.

- When weighing this review against others, note that anyone who hasn't given Schwartz's five stars invariably doesn't know how to spell - how much can you trust someone who is so stupid they either don't realize they're doing anything wrong, or they do and don't know how to run something through a grammar/spell-checker?  I poop on them and their lack of any semblance of taste, as should you.

- If you don't live near, do feel free to buy entire briskets to bring home with you, and invest in a large professional steamer so you can enjoy the meat as it was intended to be eaten.

Best.  Smoked.  Meat.  Ever."}
{"text":"When you have to wait for a table after dinner time, you know you are in for a treat. Schwartz's delivered!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. Small place on Saint Laurent.  Original location since it opened in the 50's i think lol.  Probably the same decor as when it opened but why change it.  It works.  Im a huge fan of Montreal smoked met but living in Toronto we have those places around but they fall short of the original.  Schwartz's is the original and have not changed a thing since when they started.  no matter what time of day you go you are waiting in line.  The line does move pretty fast.  This isn't your typical restaurant where you sit around and chat when you are done eating.  When you are done eating GET UP and GET OUT as there are many others waiting for your spot.  They have many items on the menu but why go there and not order the world famous smoked meat sandwich.  The amount of meat that I saw being prepared in the half hour I was there was more than your typical butcher shop.  My sandwich came piled high and still warm out of teh smoker.  The meat was super fresh, warm and tasty.  My fries were crispy and cooked to perfection  The pickle was more like a cucumber found my self eating it with a fork and knife.  Schwartz's is by far the best Montreal smoked meat I have ever had I just wish it was closer.  Every-time im in Montreal Schwart's is a MUST."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in this experience.  Ordered the meat platter and while the portion was generous, the meat tender, it was flavorless.  Listed as \"smoked\" but nothing resembling a smoke or seasoned flavor.  Ordered the coleslaw which is vinegar based which was fair. Pickle was limp with no crunch.  Service was fine.  For me it is nothing special and not worth the 40 min wait.  Overall a solid \"meh\"."}
{"text":"A visit to Montreal without a stop at Schwartz's is probably unthinkable, especially if you are a fan of Jewish delicatessen food. So I dutifully queued up on a holiday afternoon and waited patiently for my turn to take a seat and tuck in. The thing to order is of course the smoked meat sandwich, but there is a choice to be made--are you pretending that this dish can be made healthy and get it \"lean\" or do you through caution to the wind and get the \"fatty\"? Well, you can have the best of both worlds and get it \"medium fatty\", which is what I did (my table mates got it lean, and I felt very sorry for them, since it looked quite dry and unappetising). Since I was saving fat on the sandwich, I decided to go whole hog (is that OK to say at a Jewish restaurant?) and got French fries on the side.

The sandwich was very good. Not excellent, but very good. The reason for the reduction in grade was the bread, which was completely uninteresting. If they had something more like a New York rye, with a bit of body to it, it would have been great, but alas, the bread was rather limp and uninspiring. Also, please note that the sandwich is not a NY-style monstrosity that you cannot imagine a person actually eating. The size is quite manageable, so you'll have room for those sides. Unfortunately the fries were a bit lacklustre, but that made me feel less wasteful for not finishing them. The pickle, however, was great, and the Cott's black cherry soda (*the* accompaniment of choice) was perfect. Go! Enjoy! You'll thank me for it!"}
{"text":"Two words: WORTH. IT. 

My overly-picky family all loved it, and that's saying something. Yes, it's quite cramped, but what can you expect, from the most popular deli in Montreal? We got lucky and didn't have to wait for a table (at 3 p.m.) so no complaints there. 

Get the sandwich, and get it with their tangy coleslaw. Your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"Great place to get the real thing in pastrami sandwiches. 

Add the pickles, coleslaw, mustard, sweet and spicy peppers and homemade style bread and you cannot go wrong.  One of Montreal's best. 

Line down the sidewalk and groups of diners are seated together to accommodate service faster."}
{"text":"Oh come on!!! Everyone know this place. It's reputation has far exceeded any reviews.. Been going there for 30 yrs, lol.. what can I say except it's the best smoke meat house in town. I remember after the clubbing scene when you had a craving for some food you thought of Schwartz's.  Everyone  waited in line but hell it was worth it and still is.."}
{"text":"Best deli sandwich I have had. I have been to the major New York deli's and this one compare favorably. I also loved the service. Eat at the counter for a unique fun experience. Don't let line up scare you away its pet of the experience."}
{"text":"I Waited for about half an hour to get a seat. It's quite a small place without much decorations, not really a restaurant in some sense. But the meat is amazing! I placed oreder for smoked meat sandwich and cherry coke. The meat in sandwich really far too much for me, but tasty!"}
{"text":"Much has already been said about the iconic Schwartz's, but I'll echo all of those things. Schwartz's is not just a deli, but an experience. Walking in, you feel like you've stepped into 1955 and it is awesome. 

Fortunately, I went in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday in November so I only waited 10 mins or so for seats at the bar. It was, at first, overwhelming to order but the guy behind the counter simplified it. There is really only one thing to get -- the smoked meat sandwich. I opted for the middle option (some fat, some lean) and it was delicious. Food came out super quick and paired with fresh, hot fries and a pickle, it was an extremely satisfying meal. 

Do keep in mind, it is cash only. They do take US currency, but at a 10% premium. This place is super hyped, but deservingly so and should defintely make it on any Montreal visitors list."}
{"text":"Best of the smoked meat burger and pickles.. Lean meat choices.. excellent staff, nice location. worthy to spend your lunch time  here. remember no credit cards"}
{"text":"love it.

i wouldn't compare this to katz in new york. just different. and both places deserve to stand on their own.

i suggest the to go line because the sit in line was just stupid.

sandwich looks small when you take it out of the bag but basically becomes a meat bloom when unwrapped.

medium fat was just perfect."}
{"text":"While I would not eat here every day, it totally worths it to stand in line and wait once in a while for the greatest smoked meat sandwich anywhere."}
{"text":"I grew up on Schwartz's, unlike many of my fellow Montrealers, I actually really like the place. I personally go on off-hours, around 2 PM, because the line is not as long. Always order it fatty, if not it might be on the dryer side. It is a bit smokey, peppery, fat. I love mustard so there's always an extra mustard on my part, however, it might not be everyone's jam. The pairing of choice is Cotts cherry cola, and the fries and pickles are great too.

Cash only,"}
{"text":"This is the place!
Haven't been to it in over 25 years but still as good as ever.
They have perfected the recipe of smoked meat.  Get the fatty one!
The coleslaw is a great accompaniment to the sandwich.  With the pickle having a bearable level of saltiness compared to some others we have tried.  
Service is efficient.  Old style dinner is charming.  The sandwich guy (prep guy) serves up the classic grumpy but trustworthy butcher look behind the counter.
The cherry coke is the top of the cake if that is your preference. 
We came at 3:00 so didn't have to wait too long in line as the lunch crowd was clearing out.
Will be back definitely.  And hopefully not wait another 25 years!"}
{"text":"ok I had to do the tourist thing and go to this fabulous staple. Didn't know what to expect being used to the NYC pastrami scene, but I must say smoked brisket with the blend of peppercorn and other spices rocked my taste buds! Great way to start for my first visit to  Montreal!!"}
{"text":"The BEST smoked meat in Montreal.  For a Canadian living in New York, smoked meat is a must while I am in town.   If you don't want the full menu, skip the lines and go next door to the take out side and order a sandwich and cherry soft drink.  They have chairs and tables available in the back."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat ever!! Better get the large smoked meat rather than the sandwich (if you're sharing). It comes with a bread too. 
Come around the opening time (10.30 am) so you don't have to line up. 
Cash only if you eat there! But they accept credit cards for the take out.
Came here 3 times in a week!! Delicious"}
{"text":"Fast facts: Montreal must! Skip the long wait of the eat in line by ordering at the take out door instead (took less than 5 min) and check the small seating area in the back for space! The smoked meat sandwich was heavenly. 

I came here while visiting Montreal for the first time after a waiter in Toronto's recommendation. At first glance, the deli doesn't seem like much but it's these very places that are full of surprises. You can order meat by weight or order a sandwich (smoked meat, salami, or turkey). I hadn't asked the waiter what to order so I ended up going with my gut and ordered the smoked meat sandwich. Boy, was that one of the best decisions I've made. I love that the sandwich was no nonsense- a ton of meat with a dash of mustard on white bread. Four hours later and I'm still full from it. The meat was flavorful, tender and juicy. I'll definitely be craving this once I'm back in the States."}
{"text":"This is an all around staple for true montreal smoked meat
I remember coming here with my dad when I was a kid
You will never forget the taste of this special meat
Truly love this place make it a point to come here every time I travel to MTL"}
{"text":"the smoked meat sandwich was beyond great! my dad tried the medium steak and it tasted amazing! Cash only! a bit of waiting time in the line, though we already know why!!"}
{"text":"We went here twice during the 4 days we were in Montreal.  (Yes, it's that good.)  We got the sandwiches to go (the to-go line never had a wait) and sat on the curb to eat them.  This is my favorite kind of food:  simple but delicious.  Don't forget to get a pickle with your sandwich."}
{"text":"How does this place only have 4 stars? The pickle alone deserves 7. You can't be disappointed with a sandwich, poutine and cherry coke from these champions!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of pastrami, but holy sh*t the pastrami here was just amazing! It was so moist and the meat was just perfect. Anyone visiting Montreal definitely needs to check this place out. Only bad thing about the place was that it's too cramped and small for those who are dining in."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal and first time at Schwartz's.  It's a simple, humble and very friendly place serving surprisingly great smoked brisket.  The meat was so tender, juicy (glistening fat, love it!) and just all-around good!  The people there are so nice and friendly, not to mention patient.  Service is quick paced but as a first time diner, I was not rushed to order.  Overall, great experience.  Also, they take US and Canadian currency.  It was my last day in Montreal and I did not have enough Canadian bills to pay for the meal (cash only place). and even though they have an ATM available, they took my US bills as well.  I paid with a mixture of US and Canadian money and I felt bad about it, but they said \"No Worries!\" with genuine smiles and off I went on my way."}
{"text":"A place that's here to stay and won't be going any anytime soon. Great smoked meats!"}
{"text":"T'adore le smoke meat? Qu'est que t'attend pour aller au Schwartz's!? Les meilleurs en Ville"}
{"text":"I feel like Schwartz is really hyped and all my friends recommended that I haaaaaaaaaave to try this place since I've been to Montreal many times and never stepped foot in there. 

We waited in line outside for approx. 20 mins, not that bad but thankfully it wasn't freezing outside. 

My group all got the typical smoked meat sandwich and a side order of fries. I thought it was pretty cool how we had the option to choose between lean, reg, or fatty meat! Most of us chose regular. The sandwiches came pretty fast and so did the fries. 

In my honest opinion, there wasn't anything that WOW'd me about the sandwich. It got very messy real fast. I liked the fries so much more and I wish I got an extra plate of fries instead of a sandwich. Which is why I gave here a 4 stars, had I not gotten the fries I probably would give the sandwich 3 stars (sorry) 

Wouldn't go out of my way to come back but if I bring other friends to Montreal and they want to try out Schwartz, I'll definitely be getting a huge plate of fries."}
{"text":"It's not everyday that you come upon a historic Landmark to get some local Meat.
Schwartz's is the place to be for Montreal Smoked Meat, so I was informed.
If my Deli encounters taught me anything, I'm definitely in for something special.
It's with sorrow that I did not find the Montreal Smoked Meat overly impressive.

One big bite set my sense wondering, second bit bite got me even more curious.
Third big bite and I had to open up my Sandwich($6.15) to see what's going on.
It's the texture of the Meat that is different from the usual as I used my Fork.

As I Fork it, I see the Meat surface tends to dry out quite rapidly after slicing.
The Meat shreds easily, a little bit too easily without any effort falls apart.
The usually fat marbling connecting Meat strands has disappeared.
That lead to a less juicy less resistant Meaty style bite.  Toothpick required.
Doesn't signal my snarling carnivorous side of the brain as much unfortunately.

Trying not to be bias after one tasting, I requested a second Smoked Meat.
One with more Fat and it came but not quite what I was expecting.
It's the Medium Fat Meat with some slices of Fat Cap layered on top.
It gives much better juiciness and way way more fattiness. It's basically a cover up.

It's not perfect but it's still a good quality product above some others.
For the price, it's reasonable and down-to-earth considering the Tourist crowd. Kudos.
The Pickles($1.75) are a good snack to help with digesting the Fat."}
{"text":"A classic of Montreal and a must try for any carnivore. Delicious and beautifully flavoured Montreal smoked meat. I don't think you can do any better. Be ready for tight squeezes as it is always busy and tables are shared."}
{"text":"You know there is a long line for smoked meat sandwich and others. We went here around 2pm and still had to wait! Fortunately, there is another line for to-go which is lots better and shorter line. If you dont want to wait for long time and just grab food, definitely be in a takeout line. Plus, picked salad is greatly with the sandwich so don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I got the smoked meat sandwich. It looks tiny when you get it (smaller than a Subway 6-inch), but actually it's quite filling because the whole thing is filled with meat. It tastes very similar to pastrami, but is slightly drier and less sweet, and has a few herbs and spices that are not found in typical pastrami. There is an eat-in restaurant and a to-go place; I got it to go because there was a long line to eat in."}
{"text":"We did not dine in so we were able to skip the long line. Im not a big fan of meaty food but since it was kind of a must-eat in Montreal so I brought my mom here. To me the portion was a bit too much and the meat was more than enough. It was very flavourful and not too fatty. Overall it was worth trying but maybe not on a day-to-day basis."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of hype to it. It has great Montreal smoked meat (some of the best in the world) but the sandwiches are really, really basic. I've had so much better ones using their meat it has spoiled me. The service is fast food quick; they have a small menu and lots and lots of people so they cook everything in seconds. Very simple menu. 

Oh and warning this is a Cash only business."}
{"text":"The Sandwich was basic, just rye, mustard and smoked meat. Exactly like it should be. I remember going there as a child and the food is exactly the same. The pickles are delicious and the coleslaw was fantastic. My friend had the poutine and it looked amazing. She said it was really good. The line was insane though! :)"}
{"text":"I believe that Schwartz's is soooooooo overhyped. For their reputation you would expect more especially having to wait the line. I would give it a 2.5 because its still okay not terrible. I think it's good but I would never go out of my way for it. The sandwiches are okay, the lean, medium and fatty meats are slighty dry but still edible. The fries are good but they dont serve mayo or poutine because they're kosher. Overall, it's only okay."}
{"text":"Well, after reading all the complimentary reviews, I realize I will be swimming upstream, but as two native New York area residents eating deli since we had teeth to chew, this place is terrible!! The smoked meat is served cool on two small slices of a tasteless rye bread. It looks like a big serving of meat because the pkg. quality bread is so small. The meat is tough, fairly dry and almost tasteless. Neither pastrami nor corned beef, just dry brisket lacking spice. We ordered the medium fat sandwich. The cole slaw is cabbage, vinegar and a little sugar and water. If you want good smoked meat sandwiches - go to Katz's in NY. 2nd Ave and 2nd St. Then you'll know what we're talking about. The people next to us ordered medium rare steaks, about 1/2 inch thick which were as dry as leather. They came with a piece of liver so overdone it would work fine to replace the sole of your shoe. 
We got stung by the fadreit ( crazy) exchange rate too by this bunch of goniffs ( theives). They might have been good years ago - but don't let them fool you. THAT AIN'T WHAT GOOD SMOKED MEAT SHOULD TASTE LIKE!!!
    I forgot. The dill pickle was good."}
{"text":"Had a smoked meat sandwich around 9pm on a Saturday night.  The line was about 15 minutes to get a spot at the counter but it was well worth it.  I couldn't decide whether I preferred this to Katz's pastrami as they are both unreal.  Definitely a must have when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Good smoked meat. Better seasoning than the others I tried while in MTL but a little fatty for my tastes. For those who don't mind a little fat this will likely be a five for you. 

Went during the day on a Sunday on our way back to Toronto and the take out was not too busy which was a pleasant surprise based on reviews. 

The fact that this place is cheaper than T.O spots like Caplansky's makes no sense but I'll take it. 

Definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"friendly service and excellent \"smoked\" meat sandwich.  they only take cash and if you pay with american dollars you loose.  they only discount 10% when exchange rate is 20% less. also, if your change will be in canadian dollars but not adjusted so you pay another 20% by getting essentially short changed.  bottom line. eat there but stop at the atm and get canadian money if you don't have it."}
{"text":"Yummy yum yum.....

This is the only place in Montreal that I enjoyed eating at and I'll have you know I tried a bunch of places there.

We didn't know about this place at all until some dude at a men's clothing store in a near by shopping mall next to the W recognized our funny accents and felt the need to give us the 411 on Montreal eating joints. He gave us other hints too, but too R-rated to share.

Well, he couldn't stop telling us about this place being the best smoked meat house in the world. Yes he said the world. He was even stating how famous people go there all the time. The latter bit of information was irrelevant to me, but when someone is willing to say it is the best in the world, you have to put it to the test.

The place is a small divey looking joint on St. Laurent street passed all the nightlife. There was a bit of a queue, with about a 20 minute wait. Once you get in you either sit in the 10 or show tables they have or sit at the counter next to where all the meat is cut. If I was alone or with just one other friend, we would have sat there, but there were four of us and we were going to do some gluttunous style damage (aka American overindulgence). 

The floors are greasy slipper, so they are covered with rubber mats to try to provide you some gripption as you walk. Don't let your clothes touch the ground lest they be drenched in smokey oils.

We are big eaters, so we ordered a couple brisket plates, a entree of sausage and a entree of liver. The latter two were just okay, but when the plate of juicy sliced brisket came, we were in heaven. 

You actually get to choose between a lean, medium and fatty cut. I would have defaulted to fatty, but that might have been a heartattack waiting to happen, so we opted for a minor stroke instead and got the medium. It was super juicy. The seasoning fantastic. 

Slap a piece of rye bread in between two slices of brisket with a touch of mustard and you've got a true man's meal. It was definitely not for the calorie conscious nor those on low sodium diets. But if you have to go, why not with a plate of brisket. 

I was so in love with this place, I got a t-shirt to go to commemorate my visit. This place is awesome. 

I can't say it's the best in the world, but seeing my world of smoked meats is small universe, its got my vote for now...."}
{"text":"This is the best smoked meat sandwich in Montreal, albeit I only ate at 3 different establishments in my weekend in Montreal.  The sandwich here was noticeably better, the meat was not only juicy but flavorful, you can taste the essence and not just the meat.

I have being told that this place always has a line, the combination of time honored restaurant, small establishment and yummy sandwich tends to do it.  There is a place to the left that does their to-go and catering orders, so if you are ok with sitting on a stoop and eating your sandwich that one will save you the wait."}
{"text":"This place serves their own signature way of making smoke meat. If you go here you got to prepare to have  a ruff diner style service. Service à la Schwartz but customers love it.  I always take my sandwich medium even if it's not the best thing for your health, but it's the most tasty.  I order a pickle, homemade fries and cherry coke with my meal and I'm all set."}
{"text":"Woooooooooo. The fact that Schwartz's in the #1 Montréal restaurant on Yelp in horrifying. C'mon guys. You might enjoy to wait 30 minutes for the taste of delicious fat smoked meat, dry rye bread and cherry cola, but Montréal has much more to offer than Schwartz's!!! We also have poutine. Just kidding.

I would be really curious to see what is the ratio tourists/Montrealers there. No offense if you'd drive 7 hours from NY to eat their smoked meat: but I would personally not go out of my way for their stack of meat, not even on a sunny day. 

I might get killed for saying that.

For a full discussion on the topic: Is Schwartz's overrated? 
http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/526634"}
{"text":"The smoked meat was super good, but this place is definitely overrated. It was also WAY overpriced. We paid about $40 for two sandwiches, two sodas and fries. I wouldn't go back if I had the chance. Not really worth the money."}
{"text":"After sampling most of the pastrami sandwiches, I was shocked to taste the smoked meat at Schwartz's because it is actually better than those in New York! I feel a bit defeated since I am a New Yorker. 

Schwartz's reminds me of Katz Deli in Manhattan but it looks dirtier, smaller but the Jewish servants remain. Their smoked meat sandwich is not as meaty as Katz but it is juicier and tastier. They don't have fancy sauces but yellow mustard. Surprisingly, it is good enough for all of us. 

Their dill is also great as well as their coleslaw. Try the black cherry soda with your sandwich and get used to being cramped inside. 

I would come back to Montreal just for the sandwich!"}
{"text":"The line was out the door, but the wait wasn't too bad. We sat at the bar and the service was super friendly and attentive. 

They offer a lean, medium and fatty cut to the smoked meat sandwich. I ordered the smoked meat with medium fat. Every bite with the more fattier part was really good. This was my first time here and if I was to do it again, I'd order the fattier cut next time since the sandwich is not ginormous. 

This place has a good sandwich at a reasonable price, along with a friendly staff. You really can't go wrong. 

A solid 4 stars IMO. I'd come back here for sure."}
{"text":"I find that this is number the one recommended place to go when visiting Montreal. On a hot summer day, a 30 minute wait in a line might seem a little long but it was worth it. Even the crammed, cafeteria style seating did not manage to ruin this experience for me. I was told to get pickles and a large plate of smoked meat (they bring bread anyways). It was so delicious! I don't drink Coke but this meal required the classic Cherry Coke so I obliged. Service was fast and when we asked for another pickle it was delivered at a lightening speed. This is a MUST and I already want to go back!"}
{"text":"Medium Smoked meat sandwich, cherry cola, coleslaw +/- Poutine fries

Go on a weekday at night - no line & you'll get seats."}
{"text":"Since this is a must place to go when in Montreal, of course we had to try it. You can either sit in the restaurant or there is take out store right next to the restaurant.  Yes, you do have to wait in a long line but totally worth it. I would suggest take out, that line moves faster and there is a small bar in the back where you can sit and eat. Smoked meat is mouth watering.Only suggestion, white bread is too thin for the amount of sliced meat they put in the sandwich. So, the sandwich kept breaking into parts. Don't forget to grab lots of napkins."}
{"text":"I mean it tasted good, BUT the servers literally did nothing however the cashier forced me to pay the tip. That's ridiculous and glad this is the last day in Montreal."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker I can honestly say this is an amazing deli.  Smoked meat is a hybrid of corned beef + pastrami;  combining the best of both dishes.   A must visit whenever in Montreal"}
{"text":"As a fan of Montreal's smoked meat, I had yet to make a visit to mecca - Schwartz's. On this trip, I made it a goal and wow was it worth it. Other than touch-screens to generate your bill, it looks as though little has changed since 1928. Very retro-cool in the hipster rue Sherbrooke neighborhood.

But the proof is in the food. I arrived a bit early for lunch, so I got a seat right at the counter. My sandwich arrived quickly and was delicious. Rye bread, a PILE of smoked meat and just a little mustard. Yum! Fries were done just right.

Watching the staff move about a gazillion pounds of brisket. These guys are pros. Quick and efficient.

If you've tried Montreal's smoked meat, but not Schwartz's -- get on it! Totally worth the trip. One warning -- it's cash-only!"}
{"text":"I don't even particularly like smoked meats, but I ate every bite of my sandwich here. I'm from NYC, and I think this sandwich is even better than Katz's Deli's pastrami (please don't send me hate mail.) I like that it's a large meat:bread ratio. We didn't get the fries (is it just me or are Canadian style fries oily and soft and kind of gross?) but we tried both types of coleslaw (vinegary and creamy) which were a good way to cut through all the salty meatiness of the sandwich. Wash it all down with a black cherry soda pop. :) Highly recommend, despite the long lines! (tip: you can buy it from the take out counter and sit at one of the tables in the back)."}
{"text":"Rien a dire sur leur viande fumée elle est vraiment bonne. Par contre, on est tout le temps serré dans le resto. Les serveurs limite ils te mettent dehors quand il voit que ta présérie fini ton plat"}
{"text":"Montreal's famous Schwartz's deli is delicious for regular people, but disappointing for cannibals.

I, Ludwig Facessen, present you with a new Cannibal Resto Review. 

Sure, the meat is presented as though a freshly filleted fat man is still hanging in the back somewhere, but upon inspection, I recognized that the restaurant space is too small to accommodate multiple fat cadavers ready for consumption. 

Their cooking quarters are small, but so is their space. I was forced to dine next to two business men discussing quarters and stocks while I attempted to enjoy my disappointingly non-human meat sandwich.

Once I put ketchup on the bun, I was met with stares from the businessmen. I replied to their stares with the declaration that I would have preferred to see them between my buns. Dead and filleted. Cooked to perfection. Doused in ketchup. 

I was informed that the custom is to apply mustard and not ketchup to the meat sandwich.

The pickle tasted as though it were brined in a mix of vinegar and human body fluids so there is some hope for Shwartz's yet. 

The amount of staff that I encountered and spoke to led me to believe that this was the procession of people that I was to select from to sacrifice so I may ingest them. 
I chose a rotund lady named Rhonda. Unfortunately, there was a misunderstanding and she was not prepared to be sacrificed to quell my hunger.

However, we did go out to the movies and we're seeing each other again this coming Wednesday. Fingers crossed!

Three Cannibal Stars.

Four Regular."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. I came here years ago and the sandwich was fantastic. This time, I came here later in the evening (9 am) and I felt like my sandwich was super dry. Oh well. I'll have to come back a third time to figure it out."}
{"text":"Attendre aussi longtemps pour quelque chose d'aussi banal... clairement c'est totalement surcoté que ce soit en qualité et en prix"}
{"text":"SO WORTH THE WAIT! Smoked meat was perfectly seasoned, juicy, and tender. If you don't want to wait in line, you can get take-out from their store next door. You can also buy refrigerated meats. Can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I found this place hearing it's the best place to get smoked meat in montreal. and it IS!! 
Came around 8pm on a monday and there was a very long line up, so we came back the next day on Canada's day around 12 and there was no line up- amazing! Inside is packed with people, and it smells great. Looks like a diner, the walls are filled with newspapers and articles about their great reputation. The blue jays have even signed for them.

Had the classic medium smoked meat burger. Best meat sandwich I ever had in my life. Thick meat smothered in mustard on rye bread, the meat is to dye for. There's a lot of it though, but the best part is the crust. The meat is extremely flavourful, juicy, and tender. You see why they're in business for so long. Waiter recommended medium, but I think next time I would order lean instead, there was a lot of fat in the medium one. It's weird because my friend also got medium but was leaner than my cut.

They are quick to serve and they want you out of there because they gave us the bill when I wasn't done eating. Great guys though, and I would come back again if I have the chance!"}
{"text":"The greatest smoked meat sandwich I've ever tasted in the world! The fat & perfectly/cooked/seasoned meat with the mustard was amazingly delicious.

The bread was thin & the beef was tender and I was almost tempted to get two sandwiches. Best ever!"}
{"text":"Do you love to meat?
Do you like to get messy?
Ever have an orgasm from food? Did you like it?

If any or all your answers are yes  then you need to check out Schwartz. let this place delight your nostrils with the delightful smell of the smoked delicacy that they serve at this establishment. 
They tell you to grab the soda but hey if you're enjoying a delicious and well portioned sandwich (almost no bread all which is good in my opinion, who needs bread just meat!) you need nothing else but the delicious flavor of that meat. They also have a to go place, so when the wait is too long (which it often is) and the line is out of the door on a regular basis at both the To Go and To Stay part.
 My friend had just the fries here once and they weren't anything special. What is special is this meat sandwich. I wish I could have one right now.
The waiters do tend to be a little rude but they are usually overwhelmed with the amount of customers."}
{"text":"After reading reviews for so many different places in Montréal, my boyfriend and I knew we had to try Schwartz's before we left. We did just that, waited to try the famous place out until our last day! It's was AMAZING! We ate at so many different restaurants that week; a lot of fine dining but Schwartz's stole the show! The people were great the food (Brisket Sandwich) was beyond words! 

We will be recommending Schwartz's to anyone traveling to Montréal! You will definitely have to wait in a line but believe me! IT'S WORTH THE WAIT!!!"}
{"text":"The only downside about Schwartz's these days is that their prices have doubled within the past 10 years."}
{"text":"Visited this classic deli  around 9 am looking forward to the famous Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich before we had to fly back to Chicago.  Unfortunately, they don't start serving them hot until 10:30 am so I had to settle for it cold.  Still unbelievably good, will have to come back someday to experience it hot and juicy.  Atmosphere and staff were authentic."}
{"text":"First of all, I like Katz deli in NYC than this place. (Am from NYC) but the pastrami sandwich was not bad here. but service here was horrible. Bald, belly out and glass wearing guy was serving utensil and place for my table. I was with ma family. This place was packed as usual as other tourist places in Quebec.

I didn't expect to get Michelin 3 star restaurant service. However, this guy must know how to serve customers. I understand how busy he was. but HE SHOULD NOT THROW KNIFE ON THE TABLE!! HOW DARE DID HE!!

My bro got somewhat pissed and asked him gently to do nicer. and THE GUY SAID HE GOT A NEW BOSS!! What kind of service was that?? He needs to go back to elementary school to learn very basic stuffs to be a human.

By the way, food was not bad. just service was horrible.."}
{"text":"Awesome. Better than I even expected. The smoked meat sandwich was great, but the biggest surprises were the slaw and pickles, which were among the best I've ever had. (The slaw had little or no mayo, which I loved.) 

Great food, great prices, and a cool experience. Definitely will come back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is about to be honest. It was a tasty sandwich but nothing special...certainly nothing worthy of having a constant 20 minute queue outside the door. 'How good can a smoked meat sandwich really be?' is the real question. If you are only in Montreal for a short trip I would come here but don't expect to be blown away"}
{"text":"In montreal so had to try this iconic and timeless institution...

Im telling you guys, this place did not dissappointed. The smoked meat here is the best ive ever tasted. 

Best brisket ever with the perfect combination of meat and fat. One bite and its pure meat heaven. Nicely stacked and juicy ....worth the visit for sure. 

Place gets packed easily and tables are cramped...one of the servers acts as a bouncer/front office manager and yells \"how many?\" As you walk in the door. Typical butcher with a white.apron and shirt and belly....lol. 

The place is so rustic...white boards with the menu and serving only beef , turykey or chicken...no table.orderd chicken while i was there..lol. 

I did not order anything else..as i didnt wanna compromise the taste and ruin the experience..

A must try for sure for everyone coming to montreal..."}
{"text":"What a mistake to go to this place on the recommendation of Anthony Bourdain. I like and watch Bourdain all the time, but Schwartz's is not worth his recommendation because it is over priced and the food is not special.

We walked from the Marriott Champlain to Schwartz's, a trip taking about an hour, uphill, through some of Montreal's most unusual neighbourhoods. Thank you Google and Apple for not converting the metric system on our phone to miles instead of kilometre's. If I knew then what I known now I would have summoned a cab or rented an electric bike.

We arrived when no crowd were lined up about 4 pm to be personally greeted by the owner who unequivocally proclaimed the service was terrible. What he left out was the \"smoked meat\" tasted like a poor Canadian version of pastrami without NYC pastrami zing. 

The price for three soft drinks, two smoked meat sandwiches, pickles and lousy service, terrible seats and disappointment was over $60.00 US dollars. CASH ONLY. 

Never going back to Schwartz's and thinking twice about any place Anthony Bourdain recommends because he is wrong about this place and should warn tourists about it, rather than drive them to it. 

Bourdain is now on the same list as Guy Fieri because both pitchmen are splendid con artists of the first calibre!"}
{"text":"Delicious roast meat sandwiches and fries, but it is not groundbreaking or remarkable. Skip the huge line and just order take-out. It's similar to the quality you'd get at Katz in NYC, albeit with a better price.

However, I do want to express a major concern I had with this establishment being cash only. I was visiting from out of town and had not exchanged any money as most of Montreal is very debit/credit card friendly. One of the men behind the counter told me to use the ATM machine inside the establishment, which is in the back near the bathroom. I checked the machine for a skimmer and it seemed pretty legit. I used my card, withdrew cash to pay with no problems. However yesterday (about three weeks after my visit) I received a call from my Bank letting me know my debit card information was stolen from an ATM I used while traveling in Montreal. That ATM was the only ATM I ever used during my time abroad. 

It's a bit concerning that the only ATM available in an establishment frequented by tourists is compromised. I highly recommend the staff get this sorted out. Otherwise, make sure to bring cash that you acquired securely from your own bank, an affiliate, or a reputable currency exchange place."}
{"text":"Vey bad quality. I am surpsied why they are famous. Has tried it twice but will never go back or will never recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"I know, I know... this place is the mecca of Montreal smoked meat sandwiches, but I fail to see why anyone would join the 45 minute line up into the diner, when you can order a sandwich to go from the counter. Same stuff, less time. 

For that amount of time and trouble though, I really expected a sandwich that would totally blow my mind. I didn't get that, which is why I'm giving it a low rating. Not that it wasn't yummy, it just really wasn't worth the trouble."}
{"text":"I figured I had to check it out while visiting Montreal, and I wasnt the only one. The place was packed with tourists. Interior is old and dirty.  The portions were small and expensive (at least the smoked meat). All could be forgiven if the smoked meat lived up to its billing, but it didn't. It seems this place has seen better days and is just living off its legacy now."}
{"text":"A MUST VISIT. We always come here when we visit Montreal, ALWAYS.
They will be crowded and there will be a line up so expect it. We always order their smoked meat sandwich with mustard and a smoked meat poutine. (Sharing everything makes it more enjoyable) Service is good, and fast. Not a lot of seating in the back during the summer you can sit outside.

Will continue to come back in the future."}
{"text":"Man, I miss Schwartz's smoked meat. It's been many years since I had their rightfully-famous fare, and reading all these reviews makes me miss it more. Right there, on the Main. You MUST have their smoked meat sandwich. There's nothing like it here in the States. I've lived on the east coast, the west coast and in Chicago. Never had real corned meat outside of Montreal - and Schwartz's (with Lester's as a close second) is the BEST."}
{"text":"Our server was really nice. Half lean, half fatty + black cherry soda. 
Better than Katz's. ^^"}
{"text":"Funny, I'm in Canada and I ask a local for true Canadian food and he sends me to a Jewish deli for a corned beef on rye. I'm not sure why, but the sandwich was indeed great! This place seems to be an institution. 

Good smoked meat, also known as corned beef. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"The smoked meat. Oh my god it is delicious. If you are in Montreal, please visit this place and get the smoked meat sandwich (even though I would prefer leaner meat, but it is a matter of personal preference). The queueing is worth it, I promise. 

The place is cash-only."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the quality of their food. 5 out of 5 stars. Got their smoked meat sandwich. I cannot wait to come back again while I'm still in Montreal. This place is a must."}
{"text":"It sure is not what it used to be! We had to wait what felt forever (with 3 kids between 10 and 13) to be seated one on top of the other. The smoked meat was tasted, but felt dry to me. 

I've enjoyed Joe Smoke Meat much more! Experience and taste."}
{"text":"If you're in Montréal, you HAVE to eat here. Don't take anything other than the smoked meat ssndwich with pickles. And order aplenty. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Montreal famous for a reason. Line ups only drag about this place. The fries are very good. Very tight inside but it's meant it to be like a diner. My annoying girlfriend doesn't like it here anymore because she's a vegetarian and watched Netflix's \"what the health\""}
{"text":"A good analogy is that this place is the Katz deli of Montreal. A friend recommended the smoked meats in Montreal, so naturally I had to try the most famous one.  Like others have said, I would wait in the take out line which should cut your wait from 1-2 hours to half an hour.  Of course we ordered the smoked meat sandwich with fries and pickles. The sandwich is packed with their fatty delicious meat and a little mustard with rye bread. It's similar to a pastrami but the meat is thicker. Pickles were pretty yummy, sour and tart with a hint of spice. Fries were decent. I would recommend this to any out of towner, it is worth the wait. Not the best Sammy I've had but still a darn good one."}
{"text":"nothing to add regarding the food .. the smoked meat is great and a must-eat in Montreal
my tip is if the line at the main restaurant is long, simply go next door and order your sandwich. ample seating in the back. same food. in addition, if you have 2-3 people, get a pound of smoked meat and a bag of bread and make your own sandwich - you will likely get more food at the same or lower price. never order the turkey .. its processed meat

a must-eat if you are in montreal"}
{"text":"AMAZING smoked meat. A must for any visitor to Montreal."}
{"text":"Food's excellent, service's excellent. It doesn't get any better than this.  I  personnally love to eat their smoked meat with a side of cole slaw and cherry cola. I would put 5 if we could pay by interac."}
{"text":"Schwartz's Deli is a surprising Montreal institution, as the only thing that's obviously Canadian is their location at the heart of Saint-Laurent. Stepping inside here is like stepping into a timewarp: memorabilia cover the walls, vintage stools stand polished, and piles of meat stare right back at you, as if they're preparing you psychologically for what's to come. Yes, this is a tourist attraction, but it's a delicious one. The queue moves fast thanks to their cash-only communal seating friendly but no-nonsense customer service strategies.

Try their signature smoked meat sandwich (medium cut) and throw in a huge ass dill pickle (hello ladies). The whole shebang is only about C$7! Their meat isn't the most moist - this isn't life-changing stuff - but you'll be in and out of there so fast you won't care."}
{"text":"This is the one place in Montreal that my wife and I HAVE to stop at every time we visit the city. This place is nothing short of a miracle. Absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"Portion size just right

We had the classic smoke meat sandwitch 

Price is right
Seating... tight (TIGHT)
Line up 10-15 minute

Worth it?  YES."}
{"text":"I kind of agree with Leah - it was a great experience and the meat was fan-freaking-tastic (even though next time I'll go lean, but that's my own issues talking.) As a sandwich, I thought it was underwhelming.  Rumor has it that the secret is to get the plate, which is served with a rye that is apparently baked by angels in the opinion of some people I've spoken with. I'll be going back before I leave town, just to have it this way.  This place is worth a follow up for sure. Good show! Lots of history, lots of fun, and a good meal."}
{"text":"Both times I've eaten this famous stack has been at the takeout place next door (no lines). Not really sure if I've been missing something or not but the second time around it was much less enjoyable because the sandwich was sooo dry. That being said it had been on my mind ever since the first time I tried it years ago and for that it gets a 4. Probably the most sought after place in Montreal so it's got something going for it."}
{"text":"Excellent meat, and speed. Welcome to smoke meat heaven!! 

They are quick. You ask for the smoke meat sandwich. They hand it to you in literally seconds.  I would say it's one of the best smoke meat you can get in town. As a sandwich, it could be better since bread was cold. But the peppery and hot rendered fat tasted great. Slices were not too thin. Very tender and meaty. Sides are ok at best. Slaw was watery and mushy. But, the meat more than makes up for the weak bread and watery slaw. It's THAT GOOD! For $10 it's a better good deal. Compared to Katz, I'll gladly pay half the price for an excellent smoke meat sandwich for a smaller portion size.

Excellent service staff with some delightful convos. FYI cash only."}
{"text":"Love the smoked meat and the pickles very awesome experience. Love the view of the mural arts and the rest of the culture of that street."}
{"text":"When you think of Montréal you think of 2 things, poutine and smoke meat! Sorry if you thought I was going to say coffee and french.. but if you really think about it.. poutine and smoke meat are the iconic duo.
Basically this place was open a long time ago where things used to cost 5cents and traffic was never an issue.
You sit where you like (if there's space) and you order what's one the board. The servers know every detail there is about the menu so don't be shy in asking!
Medium cut with a fry, pickle and a black cherry coke... that's my order! 
Once eating you'll feel the urge to sleep... but it was well worth it.
So if you want to live the Montreal experience..  this is a must!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Smoked meat sandwich is incredibly good. Wow good to be honest.  I'd skip the fries next time though.  They were a bit soggy.  Don't let the line scare you. This is a must while in Montreal."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is way overrated. I ordered a medium fat  smoked meat and it was extremely dry. I also ordered the 'Nash' expecting to get a full stick for $1.75 or at least half a stick but I got no more than a quarter of one. Talk about a rip off. Service was pretty good and quick but the food doesn't live up to expectations. In my opinion it isn't worth it to line up for this place. If there is a line keep walking or go to the schwartz's next door. Same stuff no line (to my knowledge)."}
{"text":"My first time at Schwartz's as I am a new Montrealian. 
I was going to order rib steak, but the waiter suggested to start with their famous smoked meat. That was delicious. 
French fries and pickle are good. 
I also drank the black cherry which I didn't like much."}
{"text":"So it's true, the smoke meat here is as good as it gets...although I will not wait in line for 30 minutes to get a sandwich! If the line is big, go across the street to Main!

Also, I recommend getting the sandwich medium with a blackcherry soda."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Schwartz's so I was OK with not having the full-fledged experience of standing on line and eating in the restaurant itself.  We opt'd to use the take out storefront which actually has a few seats in the back.

We were there for the smoked meat sandwiches as we enjoyed during our first trip years ago.  The sandwich had a lot to live up to as we remembered it in quite high regard; Schwartz's did not let us down.  It was just as delicious as I remembered and I pretty much devoured it.  The meat it smokey, succulent and sensational.

You just can't go to Montreal without going to Schwartz's."}
{"text":"This is what makes a trip to montreal complete.  They have their staple of smoked meats on a platter, sandwich etc.  and ask for fatty cuts if u like that.  No frills environ.  Service is quick and you come in for the smoked meat and you leave content."}
{"text":"When in Rome right? Schwartz's is the place to try for smoked meats right? Being from Philly, maybe it's like telling someone to go to Geno's for  a cheesesteak to an outsider knowing that you can get a way better sandwich somewhere else. For me, this was the case with Schwartz's. Yes, the place is usually packed, very friendly service but the smoked meat sandwich just didn't impress. I was hoping for it to be a bit more moist, but there was a hint of dryness. The slaw and pickle were ok and had a unique flavor. The poutine was not worth ordering. Not sure how the cherry soda added to the sandwich either. Go just to say you went, but don't expect to be wow'd."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and the smoke meat is pretty good, especially the cherry coke."}
{"text":"I don't understand some of the hate here on Schwartz's.  If you know you don't like meat, don't come.  If you want something fancy and pretty don't come.  Otherwise you are in for a treat that is only found in Montreal.  

For those that have not tried smoked meat its kind of in between corned beef and pastrami.  One should order a fatty or medium cut, the lean cut is too dry.  I order fatty.  It's awesome.  Lastly if you don't want to wait in line which can be long go next door to the take out section.  They have seats in the back."}
{"text":"So over-hyped and I didn't enjoy the food. Think I'll try the Main next time..."}
{"text":"A much better than average pastrami sandwich - delicious, in fact. And cheap too, only $6.15 a sammie. It's no Katz's deli, but it can hold its own."}
{"text":"There isn't much that I can add to this place that not one person hasn't said, but I'd have to say that this is the best smoked meat that I've ever had.

Perfectly smoked and tender without being too salty, it was like eating butter. Don't forget to add the yellow mustard; it adds the final zing to the already amazing sandwich. I thought I had a pretty good smoked meat sandwich in NY, but Schwartz's blows it way out of the water. There is no comparison.

For the small price of $6.15 for one smoked meat sandwich, it is totally worth it. By far, the best meal I had during our 1-day stay in Montreal.

The added beauty to this place is the small cozy environment that has attentive staff. They speak perfect English, so grab a seat and enjoy this local delectable treat!"}
{"text":"Great place!  It's like the Ben's Chili Bowl of Montreal (for those of you who know Washington DC).  The ambiance is great.  The servers are very amiable and knowledgeable about the secret parts of Montreal (if you know what I mean).  

The overall mood is very friendly which is good because you will probably sit elbow to elbow with another customer while sharing a table.  Pas de problem, though.  Just tell them they are very attractive and they will be more than willing to chat it up.  Plus if they seem friendly/normal enough, when they leave you can eat their leftovers before they clear off the table (the servers stared, but didn't seem to mind).  But that is really a testament to their good food.  As long as it didn't hit the floor at any point, I'd eat leftovers off an attractive stranger's plate.  Bringing me to my only negative.  They could run a mop through the floor a bit more often."}
{"text":"this plc is too hyped up. went there around 11. the meat was cold. well not warm. served on lil bread with mustard. a can coke was like $ 3. the server was nice tho. this dude had a fake louis belt. tryna stunt but the stitching gave it away....."}
{"text":"Overrated just because of the tradition. The bread was bad, the mustard was cheap and the smoked meat was ok. I had another sandwich at Moe's and it's much better."}
{"text":"Overrated. Food is ok but nothing special. Staffs are impatient. I d'rather go grab a regular smoked meat sandwich than waiting in a long line. It's a restaurant for one time experience but I probably won't go there again."}
{"text":"The smoked meat at Smoke's Poutinerie that topped the poutine was much better. This place was good but not as exceptional as the 400+ reviews say it is."}
{"text":"My boyfriend would not shut up about the smoked meat in Montreal, no matter how much I pleaded with him to..

... then I finally went to Schwartz's. Yeah, it's just corned beef, basically. But it is amazing. And the mustard. I think I loved the fries, too. And the staff.

Score counter seats and scope out the action. And buy mustard to take home!"}
{"text":"Crazy, crowded little deli in Montreal were we waited in line for our smoked meat sandwiches. I mean, I didn't even know what I was ordering, I just knew that's what everyone was there for so I decided that's what I was there for too. 

The staff was brusque, fast, and competent in their jobs in whatever language anyone spoke to them. Being a tourist it was a bit intimidating but by the time I reached the front of the line I had rehearsed my order enough times to avoid annoying the guy behind the counter.

I also picked up a mustard, because when you have extra foreign money, you spend it, the end. It looks like just a normal, yellow mustard, but it makes my sandwiches kick back like nothing else. 5 stars for the mustard!

We got 2 smoked meat sandwiches and a small bag of greasy fries. The fries were, as I said, greasy, and not salted enough, and we left the overcrowded counter to eat outside in the nice weather, leaving the ketchup bottles behind in the process. TL;DR the fries were not impressive.

But I was not there for the fries. I was there for the sandwiches. The smoked meat sandwiches. The smoked meat sandwiches that apparently inspired a Canada-wide musical of Schwartz's, evidence of which we saw while waiting in line. 

We sat on a bench and when I unwrapped the sandwich I had to swallow immediately or I would have drooled. The smell was so tantalizing and meaty. I applied mustard and took an enormous bite. The flavors of the meat. The mustard. The flimsy bread failingly trying to hold back the greatness of the meat.  I ate it good and dirty. Messy and unapologetic. A blacklight would have shown my entire face covered with that sandwich. Except you wouldn't need a blacklight to see it. 

10/10 would gorge here again."}
{"text":"I almost never give a place 5 stars unless it leaves me wanting to come back 3 years later and remembering every bite of it just seeing a picture of it. 

I haven't been to Kat'z but I heard this place it up to par with it. No matter where I go, Brynd in Quebec City or other joints claiming they have smoked meat, it has never compared to how amazing their corned beef is!

After you wait the hour or so line outside to even reach the counter, you'll have the choice of how fatty or lean (or in between) you want your sandwich to be. It's placed in between 2 TINY slices of rye that I believe is just there to house the brick of corned beef you're about to devour. 

It was a bit difficult to find seating, and ended up grabbing 3 bar chairs along the wall in the back. Be sure you have a bottle of mustard right next to you when you eat this. A little squirt with every bite made me the happiest person and I recall every memory of this place as I write this 3 years later after running into this photo while cleaning out my phone."}
{"text":"What can I add that hasn't already been said before?

When someone mentions Montreal smoked meat, this is the first place to go to but I forewarn you, the bar will be set pretty high.

There are other decent places for Montreal smoked meat in Montreal but this place is tops.

Just be prepared for lineups if you're going during peak meal times."}
{"text":"Lines can be long, don't let that stop you from eating at Schwartz's! 

If it is your first time, go with the classic smoked meat sandwich, pickles, fries, and black cherry coke. You can't go wrong with the basics! 

The meat was moist and full of flavor. You get different layers of lean and fatty slices of meat in each bite. I think they make a point to include different cuts of meat in each layer.  A little extra mustard provided at the table makes the sandwich even more delicious! Take a bite of the extra tart pickle in between and some fries. 

As busy as they were, our server was friendly and took the time to make small talk with us to get to know us a bit. 

This is a great spot to check out for bachelor parties after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"Driving from Toronto for 5 hr on the way back to Boston with 10 pounds of Schwartz's smoked meat! Then you can guess how much I love it!

Try the fatty if you don't really mind fat, because it tastes best(their staff told me so, and I guaranteed it's true!) So there is no doubt why everyone would recommend it if they ever ate there. Also, you can order pickles, salad and drinks, but who cares what else they offer, would just pay attention to their smoked meat sandwich. 

Love it!!!! Whenever I go to Canada, this is a must try."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place because I feel like Kat'z (in nyc) already has the best one. Since I'm only visiting and feel like I need to try local recommendations, I decided to go at night around 9pm. The line was soooo long so I just decided to get it to go. As expected, it's not as good as Katz's. The meat was very tender to a point that if you try and pull it as one slab, it just disintegrates. I don't think it's a bad thing though. My issue is that it lacks flavor. Also, the bread was not good."}
{"text":"May the Schwartz be with you!

Eh, I expected more.  Maybe it's because I recently went to Katz and I still have fond memories of that sandwich.  Maybe it's because the smoked meat platter (read as corned beef) that I put away by myself was overly fatty.  Or maybe it's because the slab of beef that you spend so much time making deserves to be garnished with something other than a lame yellow mustard.  Call it fancy if you want.  But, I'd prefer something with a kick.  Or perhaps it's because you have no knishes.  

All that griping aside, I did enjoy my lunch here.  Packed, just like I expected, even at an off hour.  My platter of smoked meat was good and they serve it up with many slices of rye.  Good sour pickles too.  Wish you had beer for me to wash it down with.  Cash only.  Settle up with the cashier on your way out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best smoked-meat in Montreal you are at the right place! 
You come to this place not for the ambiance or the service, you come here for the smoked-meat and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Never mind best in Montreal, this is the best in the country! Get a hot smoked meat sandwich with a Karnatzel on the side. Worth the wait of there is a huge lineup out the door, but open late too so swing by after a night on the town."}
{"text":"sandwiches are OK,  just OK. mass delusional hype is the only explanation. sides were not worth it at all. skip waiting in line like a tool and just order the sandwich to go if you want the \"experience\", what experience that is I have yet to figure out"}
{"text":"Omg this smoked meat sandwich!!! I still think fondly back to my trip here. I'm not even a sandwich person but this was like brisket in a corned beef/ pastrami type sandwich."}
{"text":"A legendary smoked meat place with over 90 years of history in Montreal. It has been an iconic facet of Montreal eats with many famous people coming here from all around the world to try their delicious smoked meat! Simply love coming to Schwartz here in good old Montreal. It's the kind of place that you can keep on coming again and again.

There is usually a long lineup to get a table inside the restaurant and often you are seated with random strangers. There is also a takeout option as well which is a lot of quicker if you are looking to grab a quick bite otherwise you could be looking at anywhere between 20-40 minutes wait to dine at the restaurant.. For your time, I do recommend getting the full experience of dining at the restaurant. For the smoked meat sandwich, I highly recommend getting the fatty meat as it's bursting with that delicious goodness in your mouth. It's simply to die for. We also ordered the Schwartz poutine which has smoked meat- pretty good as well.  Service is usually pretty good here as they want to get people in and out as fast as possible. 

They usually only take debit and cash here.  I've probably been here at least 20 times and it's a must every time I come to Montreal. Overall, an absolute must to eat when you're in Montreal- it's not even a question up for debate!!"}
{"text":"My view on smoked meat has forever changed thanks to Schwartz. I bought the cold cut brisket to bring home to Toronto and it is oh so good!! This afternoon for lunch, I've combined the meat with some St. Viateur bagels and honey mustard and the combo just hit me hard and reminded me of just how much Montreal cares about their food. Seriously - Schwartz is a must stop for those who love their meat!"}
{"text":"Schwartz's is the gold standard for being the best at what you do.  They haven't changed a thing in decades, because it's perfect.

While they have a menu, you just go for the smoked meat.  I like to get the platter of medium (fattiness that is), a stack of rye slices, some mustard, and just devour one sandwich after the next.  Along the way, have some fries with vinegar and pickles, and then wash it down with a black cherry soda.

You may have to wait a little while in line and eat with other people at your table, but it's all part of sharing the experience."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat but unfortunately I made the mistake of not asking for medium fatty meat as the meat I got in my sandwich was very dry and needed more mustard. The poutine on the other hand was amazing, probably the best gravy I've ever had on a poutine. Next time I will have to remmeber to ask for medium fatty so maybe it can catapult my review up to it's seemingly deserving 5 stars. 

Usually a long line for dine in but I went for take-out; probably 15 min. tops both times I've been there."}
{"text":"Even at 12am, all of the seats were taken at the restaurant. There were 2 stores and was confused on which one to enter. We chose the one with a lot of traffic. Inside, the restaurant was cramped, old and there was still a line up to order, although not as bad as I heard in the middle of the day. My sister and I was not sure how to order anything; the menu was all over the place. we decided that a smoked meat sandwich was enough to go.
The sandwich was moist and tasted amazing as reputed. There was a lot of meat in the sandwich."}
{"text":"You can't come to Montreal and not have a Shwartz sandwich. Yes the lineups suck but the food is worth it. Don't be a douche and order the lean meat, go big. And make sure you get a pickle. If you're in a group order an entire plate of meat and build the sandwich yourself. 

And if you are in Montreal for more than 12 hours go back a second time."}
{"text":"Cheap, greasy and tasty. Go there late at night if you can so you avoid the line up. You can also take out. It's a smoked meat sandwich. it's very good. But don't go there expecting attentive service, white table cloths or even a glass of wine. It's a busy joint both for tourists and locals. You will be rushed, sit on a communal table and drink soda. (Get colt black cherry)
If the line up is too long, I just go to the main. Less popular but very very decent smoked meat sandwich."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by just about everyone, and for good reason!

There was a bit of a line up but it was worth it as the smoked meat sandwich was quite delicious. The rye bread couldn't quite hold the large stack of meat that was stuffed in between the two slices, but the messiness is part of the experience.

The restaurant has a very deli feel to it, as that's exactly what it is. It's not the type of food you sit down to eat, it's more of a wait in line, grab a sandwich and walk around the street type of deal. 

Overall the meat was delicious and worth the hype. It would be much better if there were more toppings offered to make it more complete."}
{"text":"How can you come to Montreal and not get some smoked meat from here? This time I went to the takeout store, and barely waited as it was probably due to the rain which just finished falling. I got #3 which is the hot smoked meat, and asked for it fatty (the fat melts in your mouth, it's not healthy, but who cares???) If you don't specify, they will give you medium fattiness meat which tastes too lean. ;) You can also grab a loaf of their sliced bread as it goes well with the meat, and there is seating so you can take a few bites before leaving!"}
{"text":"Sooooo close to being First to Review Schwartz! So close! Damn! Oh well. I'll settle for being numero deux. 

Schwartz is a simply inexplicable legend to people who haven't been there. Every day, the line outside staggers onto the sidewalk no matter how crappy the weather or what time of day you're there. My first time there, I had no idea what a smoked meat sandwich even was. Imagine leaving Montreal and trying my first smoked meat sandwich somewhere ELSE. My entire life has been a massive smoked meat sandwich disappointment ever since. I am now condemned to a life of budgeting trips to Montreal every few years just so I can satisfy my craving."}
{"text":"Our guide book said the sandwiches here were the best and they certainly were.  The place was crowded but was run efficiently, the service was prompt and friendly.  We were served our meals in no time.  Huge portions of the most delicious smoked meats."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich was so good! Not too much bread, all of the meat, they ask if you prefer leaner or fattier, which is perfect. I came on a weekday by myself and sat down at the bar right away, but it looks like it could become very busy on other days!"}
{"text":"Tu peux pas donner moins que cinq étoiles au Shwartz's et au Main. Les deux sont incontournables. Amusez vous à comparer si vous voulez, mais il faut aller aux deux endroits. On a pas toujours envie de manger un smoked meat, mais quand ça arrive, tu sais où aller champion! Casse toi pas la tête!"}
{"text":"Boo Boo and I walked all the way from Rue Bishop to this place for lunch. We went at a great time when the Grand prix was in town and there was a street fair along bvld of St. Laurent.  

Luckily, there was no wait for us. We shared the smoked meat sandy, fries, and a cherry cola. There was outdoor seating tent set up but if you walked in you couldn't sit outside because that was waiter service. We didn't mind sitting in the back of the place next too the window. 

The smoked meat was really tender yet with thick cuts but didn't have much flavor and the fries were not crispy. 

Boo Boo would give this place a 3 but 4 stars is fair. I'm no pastrami expert but the sandwich tasted good to me.

I did like the cherry cola a lot. It's different and has a weird after taste which reminded of all the crap I ate growing up in the states. I couldn't find the soda in supermarkets like the IGA in downtown. 


Credit card accepted."}
{"text":"We were in a rush so just did a takeaway order. The meat was pretty dry and some of the cuts of meat were quite thick. Paired with dry rye bread, it wasn't exactly the greatest sandwich I've ever had. We also got some pickles which were quite flavourless. I really only learned of Schwartz's after watching the Montreal episode of Tony Bourdain's Layover. It was somewhat disappointing as we had high hopes for awesome sandwiches. We have also been to Katz's in New York and vastly prefer the sandwiches there.

I'm not sure if the eat-in experience would have been better."}
{"text":"What's better than a crackling fire on a cold night? Walking a mile through the freezing streets of Montreal to get a world famous smoked meat sandwich from this steeped in history establishment! We arrived around 9pm so the wait wasn't too long. The sandwiches came out fast and hot and DELICIOUS! So glad we checked this off our must eat list."}
{"text":"Schwartz's smoked meat eh?  Coming from NYC, the capital of deli's, I think I would have very high standards.  So, whatdya got?  You have  two options here, go the sit down route and wait in that horrendous line or do the take out route and be in and out in 15 minutes.  Since we didn't want to waste our limited time in Montreal standing in line, we did option two.  Food here is pretty cheap you can get one of their sandwiches for $8.00 CAD (IIRC) and fries for another $2.00 or so.  This pricing of course is infinitely cheaper than what Carnegie Deli or Katz's Delicatessen will charge you.  Hell you can get TWO sandwiches at Schwartz's for the NYC equivalent.  

However, the big difference is in the size.  Katz's sandwich is huge, piled high with so much meat you could make two sandwiches out of it.  So I guess on price, it's about even.  The smoke meat at Schwartz's has a rich and deep flavor but what I disliked was how dry it actually was.  Because it was so dry, the juicy goodness of Katz's wins hands down.  I never quite understand why these Jewish delis use crappy rye bread to hold down such a massive amount of meat, they always tend to fall apart quite quickly and make a mess.  Either way, Schwartz's was a good stop to try Montreal Smoked Meat, but it just can't beat what we have in Manhattan."}
{"text":"Tonight, I finally found out what the hype over Schwartz was about. I ordered a smoked meat sandwich for take-out, which came approximately to $11 with taxes. Worth the price? Not sure. The sandwich consisted of their famous smoked meat, mustard and bread. I was hoping for an explosion of flavors when I bit into the sandwich... But I was disappointed! It tasted blend- did not meet the exceptions of \"the best\" smoked meat. The meat felt poorly smoked. Schwartz's is definitely overhyped, I must say that it's a tourist attraction more than anything.

Positive point of the sandwich: you get a LOT of meat, and that would be enough to satisfy your hunger."}
{"text":"The medium smoked meat sandwich was great, best one I've had outside of Katz deli in manhattan.  The meat is very tender.  Had the nash, thought it was just okay.  Pickles were great and the Cotts Black Cherry soda was amazing."}
{"text":"Dude, so good!

Schwartz's alone is worth the trip to Montreal! You can get lean, meaty, or fatty smoked meat. Only mustard, meat, and bread... fries too if you want them.

You won't find a better place for smoked meat sandwiches.

This is a place that does one thing right."}
{"text":"Oh, what a wonderful place. I look back on Schwartz's with a lot of nostalgia. Walking down here in the cold, getting a smoked meat sandwich and fries with a Cott's...it takes me back.

The dining area itself is very small and the lines can be intimidating, but the staff is very good at moving people in and out promptly. I've never had anything but the smoked meat, and I've never wanted to change my order. It's perfect the way that it is. 

Most astonishingly, for one of the premier tourist destinations in the city, the prices are astonishingly good. Montreal was an expensive city to eat out in, and Schwartz's is one of the cheapest places I can think of. $7 or $8 for a sandwich that big? It's an astonishing deal, and it's probably a factor in how the restaurant has retained the loyalty of the locals despite its international popularity.

Lastly, the cafeteria seating is charming. It's so small you'll almost inevitably end up sitting with somebody, and that's nice. You chat with tourists and you chat with locals. Last time I was there, I ended up eating with a governor-general prize-winning researcher and author. It's a place that draws everybody"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a meat person, but had to try a smoked meat sandwich in Montreal and I was told this was the place to do so.

Crammed in this little hole in the wall on St Laurent is Schwartz's. Do not be taken aback when you have to share a table with strangers. Order yourself a smoked meat sandwich, apparently medium is the way to go - not lean. Having thrown the idea of a healthy lunch out the window I throuoghly enjoyed this sandwich to an almost disturbing level. 

Aside from the food, service was fantastic, and my sandwich and drink total was $8 which is actually cheaper than subway."}
{"text":"I went here early on Tuesday morning around 10 and they were just 1 other party in the joint.  My boyfriend and I headed to the stool seats in front and began this mission of smoked meat goodness!  The prices are cheap and the sandwich was amazing.  It was a perfect sandwich and a black cherry soda for me that day.  I can't wait to go back!

P.S. If you come early, like I did - there won't be any fries on the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Sandwich was huge and delicious. Cash only but they have an ATM on site."}
{"text":"Unbelievable shop for smoked meat. So flavorful and great sides available - small, authentic restaurant and right next to Mont Royal - we ended up walking there after to walk off how full we were. Great for lunch or food after a night out!!"}
{"text":"A Montreal institution.

Fresh rye bread.  Melt in your mouth smoked meat. Crunchy homemade dill pickle.  Thirst quenching black cherry soda.

Insane line ups, but well worth the wait, and friendly & quick service. Go if you are anywhere in the vicinity!"}
{"text":"Searched this place up on Chowhound cus m' friend and I needed a cheap place (that provides good food) to eat. Not disappointed. :D

At first, we were kind of confused about the line-up. There was a huuuuge one for take-out. However, once clarifying we wanted to be seated, we were!... within a couple minutes. It was packed. 

Hmm... other notes: I saw a bread slicing machine! The bread was good! This was an entirely fantastic experience - one that you should totally go for when in Montreal :D

Best Smoked Meat Sandwich Evar!! 

Glad we didn't opt for Reuben's or whatever."}
{"text":"well, one thing that u must try, at least once, at Montreal. smoked meat tastes great. always long line outside."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was expecting given all the reviews and it met expectations, actually exceeded them in that I guess this is the time of year to go because we walked up at 1130AM and no line or anything, got a table to ourselves and enjoyed every moment.  

Smoked meat sandwiches were great (we had the mediums), the pickle was actually my favorite part of the meal (sooooo good).  My wife and I split an order of fries that came out very hot.  Food came out so fast. Staff was friendly and spoke immediately in English.  Great experience on a freezing day in Montreal.  

Cash only for those that are used to only carrying plastic"}
{"text":"Huge fan.

It was my first time eating at Schwartz and was surprised to see a long waiting line. So don't expect to find a place right away to seat. Although, if it's sunny and beautiful, you can always take it to go (way faster, no waiting line if any, it is minimal) and do a takeout picnic!

Price is very affordable.

The smoked meat is delicious! 

Don't forget to get yourself a marinated pickle! It really goes well together with the smoked meat sandwich."}
{"text":"One cannot fully experience the city of Montreal without stepping foot at Schwartz's. Located on rue St. Laurent, a street adjacent to the ever popular Rue St. Catherine, this modest establishment has been in business for over 80 years, serving some of the finest smoked meat you can find around. Everyone recommended this place, from our hotel concierge to my local friends and even random passerbys. Everyone swore by it and warned us that despite the long lines we might face, the experience would be rewarded.

So off we went - all seven of us. We waited in line for a while and finally stepped inside this place. It's tiny, really, especially considering how popular it is. We were welcomed in both French and English and were given menus; not that it mattered, we already knew what we wanted and barely glanced at them. We proceeded to order 7 smoked meat sandwiches, fries and black cherry soda, a local speciality drink. A meal fit for kings, and apparently to the tourists that we are.

The sandwiches weren't as big as the deli ones you get in NYC but just as tasty. The meat was tender, flavorful and absolutely delicious from the first to the last bite. The mustard adds a nice kick to it as well.

The service is prompt and efficient; they were hard to try and turn the tables and minimize the lines; the prices are nothing one should ever complain about, especially considering the quality but keep in mind that they are cash only. 

This is definitely a place that I look forward to returning to on my next adventures up in Montreal - it's modest, affordable and best of all, has been around, which adds a nice character and mood."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I was greeted warmly upon walking in and it felt like a very comfortable home-y environment. I ordered a smoked meat sandwich but didn't know there were different designations. I think they gave me one of the fattier ones. I got a drink and the pickle and all together it was almost $20. Yikes! I think that's quite pricey. But other than the price I had a good experience. I wouldn't say the meal was as amazing as some of the others I had in Montreal though."}
{"text":"Great sandwich. I never liked corn beer, smoked meat sandwich until i got to try Schwartz's.  Medium fat meat with mustard + rye bread = 'Winning'"}
{"text":"C'est une institution à Montréal! 
J'aime l'ambiance amicale et familiale. 
Les serveurs sont vraiment gentils. 
Tout ça fait en sorte de rendre la bouffe meilleur car elle est bien ordinaire. 
Je respecte le nom et j'aime l'expérience quand on met les pieds dans le resto."}
{"text":"Ok, so on my list of places to go eat at in Montreal is Schwartz's! And my list is growing based on new recommendations, at any rate, let me get back to the business at hand. The Amazzzzing smoked meat sandwich!

I ventured through the streets of Old Montreal and Villa Marie then made it to this restaurant. There was a line up out front, not surprised, waited 15 minutes and I was in.

Walking in, you are transported to the mid 80's style diner. Everything there was decades old, which adds character & authenticity. I grabbed a bar seat, and was greeted promptly. The menu was on the wall, nice & simple. I asked what's the most popular and was advised the 1/2 LB of 1 LB smoked Beef sandwich. I ordered 1/2 LB so I can walk out vs ambulance  assist and added a pickle as well 

The sandwich arrived and I could smell the meat, it was wrapped in 3 slices of bread, and a splash of mustard as well. This meat has been ages 45 days and they have been doing this since 1929 I believe. It was delicious and I may go back before I leave. Thumbs up! 

A true Montreal icon, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"So finally, after many replicas (both good and bad), my quest for a smoked meat sandwich brought me here to Montreal, and my first stop was for the real deal at Schwartz's. No suprises - it was the real deal.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Schwartz's is the definition of no frills, but the friendly staff are accommodating even if the place is packed with a line out the door (which is likely). I grabbed a seat at the bar, asked for the goods, and had a steaming hot sandwich in front of me in no time. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

If they wanted, Schwartz's could easily charge a ridiculous premium for their sandwiches - but they don't, and my standard sammie came in at $8.70. Have a look:

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg&select=NMfOyuZAKwhLRoDtGWsdAw

That's fair. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Make no mistake, this was absolutely marvelous. Sure, the bread and mustard are standard white and yellow, but the meat is absolutely heavenly. Slow smoked so that it's tender, but the consistency is maintained to where it doesn't fall apart and the flavor mixes a nice lean cut with just the right band of fat and seasoning. Brilliant. Dual Stars Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

It's damn close, but as hard as it might be to believe, on one occasion I had a smoked meat sandwich that was better than this on account of the slightly better bread and equal meat:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mile-end-delicatessen-brooklyn-brooklyn?select=f-3HfCK5xgXY82ARMEbeHw&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg#f-3HfCK5xgXY82ARMEbeHw

So, that exists, which makes it such that I can't quite go with the full five stars here. Make no mistake, you should absolutely come to Schwartz's as it's the best in the city by a mile, but it didn't quite secure the crown. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"Un resto définitivement over rated. Bien que les smoked soient bons, j'ai goûté mieux à Montréal (Lesters). Service toutefois rapide, et atmosphère agréable."}
{"text":"So in my last review I wrote that it probably didn't taste any different than any other place, and I'd like to correct that. It DOESN'T taste any different than any other place. At the time of my first review, I hadn't been there in over 1 year. I went in to give it another chance, had a smoked meat sandwich, looked at the place, got disgusted, and left. How they can let it get so dirty is beyond me. I've tried better. And the place is MUCH cleaner. What place you ask? well I don't know if it's fair to the owner's of this place if I post it in the review, but it's right next door to H&M (downtown) on Saint Catherines street O (West). Place starts with an R"}
{"text":"I'm from Florida, and I smoke my own meat.  So I'm a bit clueless to the appeal of \"smoked meat\" but I figured I had to try it while in Montreal.   Lots of helpers can't be wrong about this being a good example of monteal smoked meat so i tried it. 

It was, well, meh.  It was like smoked corned beef.   Which I do in fact make at home on my smoker and slice thin on a professional berkel slicer.  I'll say, mine is better.  

The sandwiches at Seattle's lion like Carnegie deli ( in New York) proportions but is all trickery of scale.  The entire sandwich is about half the size.  It comes on a 5/6 inch plate.  Keep that in mind as you review the pictures   

The service was attentive enough and the food wa okay, just not as huge as it looked and not as good as I'd hoped.   The meat slices are about 3/16 thick, not shaved.  I can't knock them for being famous at something i just didn't appreciate, so they get 4* for being good at what they do - whether one appreciates it fully or not."}
{"text":"I went through quite the trek to try a sandwich from Schwartz's, and it was more than worth it!

Great service, cheap, and very filling. Really can't ask for anymore. Get the smoked meat sandwich, you know you want to -- simple and delicious! You're missing out if you try anything else."}
{"text":"Institution of smoked meat.   Great as always.  We got the platter to go with rye bread to devour in our hungover group."}
{"text":"We have been to Katz deli in NYC and this place is in that same league with outstanding food and one hell of a sensory overload. The line outside will be long but it moves really fast. The staff, while in a rush remain delightful and engaged. 
If driving, good luck. We used an under the building public lot on Rue Saint Cuthbert and paid a reasonable rate for a 24 hour stall. All side dishes are sized to share and they do not take credit. 
I'm odd in this way but I often take note; they may be very small but the washrooms are nice and clean. That's right, up here there are no restrooms, just washrooms or toilets."}
{"text":"Schwartz's certainly has fantastic smoked meats worthy of the Championship belt in Montreal, but I'm not sure the lines are warranted.  Try the takeout line and sit on the benches across the street.  Eat your sandwich and stare at the people in line as you enjoy meaty goodness and they wait 45 minutes for a not-so-comfortable diner seat in the restaurant.  The prices are very high at about $18 for a full meal so I'm not sure it's really worth it.  They pile the sandwich high but it comes bland on some unspectacular bread.  The expert order really is the poutine with added meat so you get the best of both worlds without the dingy bread.  till, ift here's no wait, Schwartz's certainly is a must visit even just to split a mid afternoon snack among your tourist brethren."}
{"text":"When I eat smoked meat sandwiches,  I base them all on the ones found here. Best in the world. Sometimes hard to find a parking spot. Sometimes you have to wait in line just to get in. It's that popular because its that good!"}
{"text":"The smoked sandwiches are delicious! Reasonably priced and pretty quick to get through the line. They accept credit cards, which is convenient because a lot of other places in the area don't!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Tender and great flavor. On par with brisket from central Texas. Went in on a Monday afternoon, between lunch and dinner. Only waited for a minute or two outside.  Coleslaw was verygood, flavor of sweet dill pickles. Buy a shirt!  Never did and regretted it."}
{"text":"Tried its smoked meat sandwich. The smoked meat was really tender and succulent! Very pleasantly marinated! But this sandwich spilled with unhealthiness as it was really oily. Was quite messy to eat as well.

The place was a 20-min walk from the nearest metro station ... if you are not a big foodie, I do not think it is worth making the distance for the sandwich."}
{"text":"May the Schwartz be with you....

Thursday @ 2pm: No wait
Saturday @ 1:40pm (in the rain): 45 minute wait

All you need to get is:

- 1 Fatty Smoked Meat Sandwich (it comes in lean, medium, & fatty)
- 1 Cole Slaw
- 1 Pickle

The ambiance is no frills, but the food will have you shaking your head yes on each bite. The smoked meat had the perfect amount of fat (there were no grisly pieces) and you will be tempted to order another one to share.  We tried the medium version after the fatty and we could tell the difference (fatty is king).  The cole slaw was tossed in vinegar (instead of mayo) and was the perfect side item.  Schwartz will definitely be a mandatory stop the next time I'm back in Montreal."}
{"text":"I could eat a smoked meat sandwich from Swartz's every day. Delicious meat, topped with mustard, on rye bread. Scrumptious. Not overly salty or soggy. They cook so much, it's always fresh. Don't be discouraged by the line outside the door, it moves quick! Once you get through the doors, your service is awesome, food comes fast. They are overly crowded, hard to walk in and out of the door. Bar is an option to sit at. 
They do accept America dollars, but charge slightly more if you decide to pay that way. They also charge extra if you split any sandwich."}
{"text":"Great smoked beef sandwich with fries. Clearly this place has been around for a long time and has a strong following. Limited menu choices, but that didn't matter to us as we wanted to try their specialty"}
{"text":"The smoked meat in the window lured us in as we walked past at midnight. We bought a pound of cold sliced brisket to go for sandwiches for lunch during long ride back to the States the following day. At lunch on the road the meat warmed up a bit. It was aromatic, zippy, smokey and moist. At $10.95 a pound, it was a bargain. A little mayo and a baguette, oh man, I'm in Jewish meat heaven."}
{"text":"My Montreal friends said that this place is a must go if I was in the city touring. It does seem very historical and the owner or manager shouted names, which I assume only comes out of being in business for so long. We got the classic smoked meat sandwich paired with a black cherry soda, and it was packed full of flavor. The only complaint is that it is much smaller than it sounds/looks. The next sandwich my friend ordered (don't remember the name) was very plain."}
{"text":"I'm sure being the 353rd reviewer that all has been said that can be for this place. Just suffice it to say I have to stuff my face there once every visit to Montreal.  The smoked meat isn't even my favorite part - I really like their cole slaw.  Wish they prepared it this way in America."}
{"text":"The best smoked meat in
town.  There's often a line but
the service is swift."}
{"text":"La place à Montréal pour un bon Smoked meat! Ambiance inégalée tu peux manger à côté d'un inconnu et c'est pas grave ! Important c'est la bonne bouffe!"}
{"text":"This is why Montreal is famous, this is why people love food in Montreal. Schwartz, an amazing honest place with great people and equally great smoked meat. If you are in mood for good quality smoked meat and truely just care about that then this is the place for you. No shenanigans, no nonsense, just hits the spot. Anthony bourdain definitely knows his stuff."}
{"text":"Schwartz's, you are the stuff that smoked meat dreams are made of.

I've been coming here my entire life.  As in before I learned to crawl!

Some detractors may speak negatively about your long lines and your lack of customer service.  \"P'shaw\" I saw to these detractors.

I love the karnatzel - ask them to throw it on the grill for a few minutes.  All the better.  And - sacrilege as it may be - I like my smoked meat old fashioned and LEAN.  I don't feel that ordering it lean at Schwartz's dries it out.  It's perfect.

Top if off with a black cherry soda, and welcome yourself to the cool crowd.

I can't wait to be in Montreal in September... my taste buds are already excited."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! This place is definitely a must-try in Montreal. Succulent hot smoked meat sandwich on rye? Hand made fries, soda, and mac salad....about 7000 calories later I was still drooling. I want to go back here for sure! I've been to Kat'z in NYC and this place is equally as amazing at a fraction of the price. Also- go to the take out side if you're a small group- they also accept card on that side. :-B 
 Go here. Now!!"}
{"text":"Great Smoked Meat...not a fan of the wait"}
{"text":"We decides to go Montreal for the weekend and upon recommendation of our hotels front desk we ended up at Schwartz Deli. Let me be frank! This is a tourist trap! And being tourist in Montreal we fell right into the long line to get in. Did you know this was owned by Celine Dion? She could retire from singing with the amount of cash this place makes...and it is all cash, no debit, no credit! The place has the look of nostalgia but sadly the food doesn't live up to the hype....we ordered smoked meat medium with which I was expect something of epic proportions....first fail...just a lop side sandwich that can be had at any decent street corner deli or restaurant in Montreal. Then we had a Turkey sandwich which being such a landmark establishment would have real roasted turkey, not! Grocery store deli meat at best! It makes me wonder where they get their Smoked meat from? I then order a 1/2 sour pickle...im thinking only half sour...our out of work Comedian who was filling in as a waiter says\" you know a pickle it's made from a cucumber??\"....aren't they all? Out comes the pickle.....yes indeed a cucumber that was soaked in bath water! I took one bite and was looking for the waiter so I could lobe it back at him! Coleslaw - vinegar with a hint of slaw! My friends from the south would by crawling up and down the walls in disgust....if you can't make slaw close your doors! 2 smoked meat, 1 Turkey, 2 pickles, 2 fries( over cooked) 4 pops and 1 slaw with tip almost $70 cdn. Go once to say you've been and don't go back!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying Schwartz's lives up to the hype. Old school Jewish Delicatessen vibe, no thrills decor, and that mouth watering scent of meat when you walk through the door. 

We had a group of 20 guys (for a bachelor party) and went to Scwartz's around noon on a Saturday. The line was long but moved extremely quickly - this may have to do with there only being 3 sandwiches to choose from - either way, we destroying our smoked meat on Rye within 20 minutes. 

Bread: Not the traditional Jewish rye I am used to -  it was a softer, smaller version of the classic deli sandwich bread. 

Meat: Succulent and you really get a variety of type in your sandwich (finely chopped, thinly sliced, etc)  - the burnt fatty ends were the highlight. 

The sandwich itself is smaller then your NYC Delis, but the price reflects that as well. The one knock I have was the brown mustard was not available as a free condiment. They do sell the brown mustard in a bottle, which was a little frustrating as I expected it to be available for free."}
{"text":"I just don't get it. I know it's a historic deli and half the fun is saying you came here but I didn't find it too appealing. It's dingy, crowded and you get a little sandwich with a smear of mustard. To be fair, I'm not a big deli person and the person I was with loved it but I think unless you really love this kind of food and history, you can probably skip it. The service is very friendly though!"}
{"text":"Iconic Montreal restaurant. After living in Montreal for over 24 years, I finally decided that it was time. Time to go to this famous smoke meat place. One of the reasons that I did not go to this restaurant earlier in my life includes different reasons, but mainly the fact that I only tasted mediocre smoke meat sandwiches so far in my life. Needless to say, my expectations were pretty high for Schwartz.

I went there on a winter evening with some friends during a weekday. Fortunately, there was only a very small line and we were seated fairly quickly. The decor of the restaurant itself looks very vintage, almost as like they did not change anything since their opening. As for the food itself, the price tags are pretty high considering their portions (around 10$ for a smoke meat sandwich if I am not mistaken). That being said, the sandwich itself was decent, but definitively nothing to hype about. As I am not a big fan of salty meals, this is definitively not in my alley. Unfortunately, Schwartz was not able to convert me into smoke meat"}
{"text":"I don't understand the line for this place... 2 plain pieces of white bread with sub par smoked meat."}
{"text":"Really, charge $11 for a pretty good corned beef sandwich, and only take cash. I get tradition and quality but a good brisket at home could feed 10 for a little more than the price of one of the sandwiches plus fries and a drink."}
{"text":"They rival NYC's famous Katz Deli. I sat on the counter with a friend and we ordered their smoked meat sandwich on rye, and shared fries and a pickle. The meat is tender, moist, and extremely flavorful. Their smoked meat is like this review: simple, no frills, and no fuss. I liked it and I'm sure you will, too.  Since I'm not a local, I said I would visit Schwartz's at least once when visiting Montreal. It's like a NYC tourist visiting Katz' deli at least once on their visit: why not.  When on vacation, I don't usually remember the price of my meals because living in NYC, most things are pretty expensive already (Katz' sandwich is $15-$17 for one! Geez).

There was a line out the door. The interior is busy (not cozy), but counter staff is friendly."}
{"text":"A bit of a wait to enter, but when you're inside you'll enjoy the smoked meat sandwich. I had the medium variant it was on par with what you'd get in at any NYC deli that would serve this. I also recommend the black cherry Cott soda, but not the poutine or the fries. Just stick with the classic."}
{"text":"I'm a former New Yorker familiar with Katz's. The smoked meat sandwich here is more similar to corned beef than pastrami. Better than New York corned beef but not as zesty or spicy as Katz's pastrami"}
{"text":"I didn't even realize it was possible for brisket to be this tender. I got the famous smoked meat sandwich with fat, and it was the best meat sandwich I've ever had. The texture of the meat was so soft and rich that I had no idea how the employees were able to slice it without it completely falling apart. The price is very reasonable, and the overall look of the place, pricing, and menu seems to reflect the place sticking to its roots and continuing to do what it does best, while remaining accessible to anyone."}
{"text":"I got there at 1150am
No line up but when I left there was a big line up 1230
Again, friendly staff very straight fw, nice
Space is VERY tight
Yes, the smoked meat served on rye was delicious
I got the fatty option vs the medium option
In the fatty option, they will add fatty bits on the sandwich
The rye bread is so fresh and fluffy, it.s great
I had the sour pickle and fries and they recommend a cherry coke
Which is better than coca colas cherry coke just because it (probably had more sugar and artificial cherry) flavor
Service is very fast...cash only!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Montreal.  I had seen Schwartz featured on the tv show \"Family Jewels\" with Gene Simmons.  If you are a real foody you will love this place.  It is not for everyone due to its old school deli atmosphere.  I will repeat the next time I get to Montreal."}
{"text":"Hot damn. This is a meat lover's dream come true. What more can you ask for when you already get stacks on stacks on stacks of smoked meat in a hot sandwich. If I had the stomach for it, I would probably eat 5 more. What the heck, just give me a plate of the smoked meat instead and i'll instantly devour it! 

For about $10 Canadian cash (which is not too shabby), you get a hot smoked meat sandwich layered with lots of smoked meat and mustard in between. So simple yet so orgasmic. Meat is so tender and juicy and it just melts in your mouth with every bite. I probably ate this whole sammie in less than 5 minutes. I had to slow down so I wouldn't choke on the meat...

Other than their popular hot smoked meat sandwiches, you can also buy other meat like turkey, chicken, and salami. They also have sides like pickles and fries. Curious in trying the other stuff but I think I'll stick with their smoke meat ;)

Schwartz's has a dine in area with a few tables and seats and also a TO-GO area with a few stools here and there. If you want to avoid the long line and wait I suggest you go get yourself a few sammies and plates of meat from the TO-GO area and eat elsewhere :). 

Quick and efficient service for stacks on stacks of hot smoked meat!"}
{"text":"Ok... I am born in raised in Montreal, now living in Toronto. So I am truly  Montreal-er at heart. Now, yes I know this is a must-go-to for visitors, it's historical! You can't NOT pass by Schwartz's if you are in Montreal, it just wouldn't be right...
However, I have to say that I have eaten my share of smoked meat, and will give the honest opinion that Schwartz's does NOT have the best smoked meat in town.
I give the smoked meat a 3...maybe a 3.5 on 5. 

So, you get there and yes, usually there is a line up, sometimes just to the front door, sometimes down the street, I have apparently been quite lucky, never seeing a line-up when I go..
You step inside and notice how small and 'homey'? the place is... if you are three or less people you will most likely be sitting with other random bodies who are also embarking on this piece of Montreal tradition.
Plastered all over the walls are newspaper clippings, reviews, photos and other miscellaneous memorabilia claiming the fame of Schwartz's.
I usually order a smoked meat sandwich and a pickle on the side, because what goes with a smoked meat sandwich like PB&J other than a pickle!
Unfortunately I find the bread to be quite dry and hard... so maybe I could recommend just ordering  a platter?
I would say maybe 50% of the time the meat I get served is pretty good, and the other 50% it's on the old/dry side... maybe it just isn't busy and dries out? I couldn't say...
But, the staff is always on point there, no matter how busy it is, you'll order in good time and get your food in even better time!

It is definitely a place you must go to once in your life! But when you've been there already I would recommend venturing to some of Montreal's other smoked meat joints, they might not have all the years Schwartz's has... but they know what they're doing! ;-)"}
{"text":"What more is there to say about Schwartzs? You like Montreal smoked meat sandwiches, then you come here."}
{"text":"Too much hype. They produce a decent smoked meat sandwich, but definitely not worth waiting in line for. 

I honestly wouldn't even eat it unless I was pretty hungry... Just food I would get if I needed something quick to eat. 

The sandwich I received was pretty small and while the meat had a nice amount of fat in it, it didn't really have much flavour."}
{"text":"If you love smoked meat, this place is heaven. Always packed with people and the waiters look a little stressed but once you take a bite of that smoked meat you forget everything! The way it melts in your mouth, the tenderness goes beyond expectation. This place tops any smoked meat joint I've ever visited."}
{"text":"I know this place is an iconic Montreal place to eat at but I didn't see what was so special. The deli still retained the old school look. The deli was busy and the staff were incredible, very friendly and took the time to get to know you.

When the sandwich came, it was underwhelming. It tasted good but would it be worth the 2 hour wait? I don't think so. The smoked meat wasn't really anything special, it just seems like a touristy thing to do."}
{"text":"This is the perfect example of hype outweighing reality. The food is average and the service is below par. Our waiter forcefully suggested a meal option which he said was a great deal and also decided to add some things we didn't order. Tip tell them exactly what you want and dont let them upsell. This great deal was exactly the same price as on the menu if ordered separately. Only having a few nights in montreal i was very disappointed i wasted one of my meals at schwartz's."}
{"text":"The meat is very fresh. We lined up outside for around 20 minutes at over 8pm. It is worth the lineup though. We ordered the combo and the large plate. The combo is of greater value in my mind(with rib and smoked meat together)"}
{"text":"Woohooo thank you, Merci Jenjen.

small dinner that's been opened since the early 20's which used to be Jewish is now a Spanish-Portuguese neighborhood of Montreal.  it's not your prettiest diner, but I consider this place a GEM and a dive all at once.  Why? keeping your classic dishes, well, classic and don't change them.
Supposedly Celine DIon is a fan of this place, its no wonder why we all like Schwartz, not because of her, but because of its traditional deli meat sandwiches and pickles it serves.

If you're not used to sitting in close spaces beside people or sharing tables, go elsewhere, for food is business..... here's the breakdown:
Smoked meat sandwich- Easy 5/5! no shortage of smoked MTL meat in this one.
Cornichon- well this is the biggest pickle I've ever eaten, but it was delish! 4.5/5
Poutine- It was ....okay..I truly felt I've had better....3/5
Black cherry cola- perfect way to wash down my meal and what our waiter recommended. 4/5.

Service was efficient!
place was somewhat clean....
overall experience is a solid 4 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Always the place to go for quick and good service, a must stop when you visit Montreal! Their portions are a good size and they are decently priced. The seats fill up quick so go earlier."}
{"text":"\"A Montreal tradition since 1928\" - Schwartz's deli is Canada's oldest and most famous deli. Founded by a Jewish immigrant from Romania, Schwartz's is famous for  its amazing smoked meat sandwiches. The meat could possibly be described as a cross between corned beef and pastrami, but really it's in a genre of its own. 

Comparisons are often made to NYC's Katz's Deli, and there seems to be a bit of a meat rivalry between the two, which makes the experience that much more interesting. Personally, I think Schwartz's wins for flavor and juiceness, but the debate rages on. 

Like Katz's deli, the atmosphere at Schwartz's is chaotic, loud and crowded. And like Katz's, you stand in line first to yell out the order for your food, then wait among the crowded tables to be served. You can choose among three cuts of meat - fat, medium, and lean. Take the plunge and go for the medium or the fat. You didn't come here to eat healthily anyhow. And go with the Montreal tradition and get a black cherry soda and pickle to accompany your sandwich. 

The perfect place for a great nosh at a Montreal institution. People make pilgrimages to this legendary deli from around the world - if you're in town, its worth it to experience at least once, at least if just to weigh in on the great Katz vs. Schwartz debate."}
{"text":"YUMMMY!!! That's all I gotta say. The special number 2 is where it's at. You don't need fries, just get the sandwich. It was bombastic! For sure I will come back for this before I leave!!"}
{"text":"I like this place, I just find the meat a little dry and I'm not willing to wait 20 mins for smoked meat"}
{"text":"Was visiting with family and had 3 kids (under 5!) and 4 adults in our party.  The area to eat is very tight and only ONE of us was ordering the highly recommended smoke meat.  With that being said, the staff could not have been nicer or more friendly.  It was intimidating with the crowd and ordering not the recommended food, not to mention having the kids there but the food was still delicious and the staff was beyond friendly.  They even offered to take a photo of us all (without us asking at all!).   Great experience and the smoked meat sandwich and turkey was awesome.  Highly recommend to visit!"}
{"text":"It's a little bit pricey but the deli sandwhich was filling! Get yours with a pickle!"}
{"text":"Quand on va a Montréal , on y arrête, pas le choix. J'y ai été souvent et c'est toujours pareil. Pas l'endroit qu'on va pour le service et la gentillesse des serveurs, mais si tu veux un smoked meat c'est là que tu vas! Cherry coke.. yep!"}
{"text":"Just ok.  Meat wasn`t juicy, and I found I was adding a lot of mustard while eating it.  The bread with the `sandwich` seemed superflous since it was too small to contain any meat inside it anyways.

Also, I think I just paid $1.75 plus tax for a large pickle."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is what I'd like to call a tourist \"trap,\" meaning that it's hard to call it one when they actually are good at what they do. Every time my parents visit Montréal, we always have to go one time because they love their smoked meat sandwiches. In my opinion, it can be kind of hit or miss because of the way they break down the fat while cooking the meat, which I find can be somewhat gummy at times and not melt-in-your-mouth. You could always solve that problem by ordering a lean cut, which I normally wouldn't choose because I find fattier meat more flavorful, but that's usually when it comes to Chinese meat preparation rather than the Western style. Other than that, however, they season it really well, and for some reason I think their mustard is the best I've ever tasted (I could literally just buy bottles of them; please don't judge me). It's hard to go wrong with their items and their cherry coke overall, and honestly, I have to thank them for helping grow my coke bottle collection to its currently humble size of three."}
{"text":"The NY Katz Deli equivalent in Montreal.  This tiny mom & pop shop is a Montreal visit must.  The smoked meat sandwich comes in different types of fattiness: lean, medium, or fatty.  I personally thought the medium was just perfect.  Think the lean meat doesn't capture the true taste of the smoked meat flavor and fat meat is overwhelming.  It's juicy tenderness and flavor of the meat still lingers.  Definitely well worth the wait.  We were fortunate to wait only about 10 mins when we arrived around 1pm on Sunday.  The fries were a great pairing.  We didn't order the cole slaw but I saw the table next to us order cole slaw and it didn't look too drenched with mayo. Would try on our next visit.  Also saw a few tables ordering their steak, need to try next time.  

Tip: Come early to avoid long lines and cash only."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a bit skeptical being a New Yorker who goes to Katz's but I ended up really liking this place.  It is small but there is a real order to the chaos.  Don't expect to get your own table as most of the tables are communal.  Waiter, and in our case other guests, were super friendly.  As far as the food, we started with a sour pickle and fries, excellent!   The Quebec version of smoked meat is more like a smoked corned beef compared to what I consider NY smoked meat which is Pastrami.  Nevertheless, the Quebec version is excellent!  Yum!  I didn't even touch the bread, took a forkful of smoked meat, little mustard and.....DELISH!  Highly recommend.  

N.B - There is usually a long line in front of this place but luckily we breezed right in."}
{"text":"Great place! They offer one type of meat, smoked meat. If corned beef and pastrami had a baby it would be smoked meat. I loved it! I rank this place way above Katz deli. I also really liked how you can choose how much fat content you want. I prefer a bit more fat because it adds flavorings, so i ordered medium fat. You can also do a mix, lean and fat..the fries are very good, handcut and thick. Also, their frankfurter was good as well. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I ever ate in my life. 

Seriously. 

I cannot even put into words how the flavor and texture of the meat is just plain perfection.

Sorry, New York. 

And Philadelphia, I've eaten more cheesesteaks than years since your birthed our nation (2011-1776=235), so I'm sad to say this tops Pat's, Geno's, Jim's, etc. 

Don't bother with the pickle and cherry soda crap, that's just so they make more money. Give them your seven bucks and take your sandwich and go make out with it."}
{"text":"Oh, my word! Smoked meat sandwich to rival anything Katz/NY has to offer. And tasty fries, and slaw with a sweet vinegar dressing, and pickle. Wife ordered a steak...got a thin grilled steak-very good-with a side of smoked meat, couple of pieces of smoked sausage, fries, slaw, pickle, bread. Seating is \"cozy\"...meaning when people get up others are seated. We were surprised that the young men at our table were from Vanderbilt Univ, only about 3 hrs from home! 
Loved the showcase window of the cafe loaded with smoked briskets & sausages. Waited only about 15 minutes to get in...line was half a block long when we left. CASH ONLY!!  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Interesting vibe but the smoked meat sandwich was average at best.  Plain bread and meat was not very flavorful.  Lots of meat and friendly service but the food was not up to expectations.  Lots of great food in the city so would recommend you try another place."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic!!  The service was wonderful and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"\"You haven't been to Schwartz's?\" and \"You must go to Schwartz's!\" were among the comments from various people about this place before i decided to go. So one Saturday evening i decided to join the masses and have my own say on it. 

The place: The establishment has two different sides a take out and sit in and if you are going there for the first time sit in is a must as the ambiance is half the experience. From the outside you can't see much except that there is always a lot of activity around it. There is meat that in the window and most of the other windows are steamed up probably from the meat sweats and excitement from people inside. This adds to the place as you cant really see inside. We went around 5 o clock and it was very busy however we were seated straight away. You could tell there was something special about this place as soon as you walk in. You might have to wait if you have group (4+) however they turn over the tables quite fast. 

Food: So like anyone going for the first time, I went for the classic smoked meat sandwich a dill pickle and fries. It came out within about 7 minutes maybe less. I went for the extra fatty version because you know \"When in Rome\". My eyes could not believe it when it came out, there was a substantial amount of meat with a small bit of mustard and two slices of bread however you have to realize when you come here that this place is about the meat. The taste was amazing, so flavorsome and juicy with every bite. Adding a bit of extra mustard can be useful as its quite heavy. You could tell that the meat has been aged for a very long time the meat was very tender. The dill pickle was good but probably not worth $2.10 for it. 

We finished our meal in about 10 minutes. The price in total was about 15 dollars. 

I would highly recommend this place especially if your only in Montreal for a weekend and your looking for a meat fix. Its one to remember."}
{"text":"There's a reason why there are always people consistently lining outside rain or shine to be able to eat at Schwartz. People will always tell you one thing when visiting Montreal, and that is to try Schwartz for its signature Deli Sandwiches with a nice cherry coke on the side. An excellent representation of what Montreal has to offer."}
{"text":"This is a well-known establishment that has lots of fans and lovers. I get it, I've been to really good delis and this is better than OK. But I don't understand the hype and lore. It's a pretty good deli but...The smoked meats are good and you need to order your cuts with fat in order to get a good sandwich. If you're in the neighborhood, check it out but I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was at the top of my list of restaurants to try when I was in Montreal.  We arrived at this place 1/2 hour before they closed and it was still quite busy inside.  We had no problem finding a table to sit down.  Maybe not the best time to go as I found their infamous Montreal Smoked Meat was not that flavourful.  We ordered the one pound platter of smoked meat with 1/2 lean and 1/2 fatty meat.  Well, I learnt my lesson as the lean meat was way too dry.  The fatty meat was good, but to be honest the meat did not have a very strong smoked flavor.  This place was a disappointment.  But from all the good reviews, I might just give this place another try.  Next time, I will have to go earlier."}
{"text":"Been going to Schwartz's for years.
Order the medium smoked meat sandwich with fries, half sour & cherry coke."}
{"text":"Wow this place is incredibly overhyped.  Tried the smoked meat sandwich and the meat was just not that tender.  The seasoning and flavor was pretty good though - I liked that it was not too salty."}
{"text":"The best smoked meat in Montreal! I dream of this place! Must be had with a Black Cherry soda! :)"}
{"text":"If Schwartz was an institution, I'd sign myself in voluntarily every single day!

What can I say about this place that most of you don't already know?  It's a jewel of Montreal, arguably the best smoked meat in all of Canada if not the east side of the continent!

Line ups are abound year round, especially during the summer and long weekends.  Here's a tip: don't go in large groups, go as a couple or threesome, it allows you to skip the line faster.  

The smoked meat here is delicious, absolute heaven to taste into.  When you order your sandwich, ask for fatty meat for the most flavour, also order a side of coleslaw, pickles and a cherry pop to complete your Schwartz experience.

But most of all, say hello to the patrons you'll be nestled in tightly with in the communal tables.  

On your way out, be sure to stop next door to get a pound, or two to go!  I always do!

This place is a must visit for every single visitor to Montreal because nowhere else does smoked meat like they do!"}
{"text":"schmucks line up in the cold to eat overpriced cuts of meat. for a combo you're looking at $16/$17 cash (no cards), there's no way you're getting out of there for under $10. overrated dirty tourist trap."}
{"text":"Amazing deli, reminds me of the best places in NY... they're known for their smoked meats, and I couldn't help but get a large plate of pastrami, and I enjoyed every bite. I recommend this spot to anyone wanting a delicious deli experience with all the hustle and bustle of the best of the best."}
{"text":"Another overrated forklore. Disappointed at the first bite, after waiting for 5 mins in the long line. It's okay only if you are a meat lover and only cares about how much meat you can eat. A lot of handkerchieives with suspicious feedbacks on the wall. Those in Chinese to my knowledge are probably fake, no real person speakscin that way."}
{"text":"So, finally made it to Schwartz's after three months of living in Montreal. On one side, I see people on here say \"it is not worth the hype\". My friend, however, said don't listen to those people. My friend was correct. I ordered the smoked meat sandwich, medium-fatty, a pickle and a black cherry soda, and it was amazing. We went on a night where we didn't have to wait in line. But, honestly, I would wait in line next time. Also, people said that Main Deli across the street is basically the same...no it isn't. When I left Main Deli, I felt that the smoked meat sandwich was somewhat bland. I did not have that feeling when I went to Schwartz's. The meat, mustard and bread were all quite favorable. The service was quick and friendly. And as far as my recommendation, go with what they recommend, because it is probably the best way to have it. Easily, one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"It was good. A little expensive, but the taste was worth the experience. I'd come here again but I'm not a fan of how crowded it is. But hey, it certainly nails the feel of the hole in the wall, hidden gem kind of restaurant.

We got the fatty one because we figured screw the calories let's make the most of it. Alas we think we would have preferred the medium or medium fat, but it was still very delicious."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, the Montreal-style smoked pastrami sandwich at Fumare is one of the two best things you can eat in Chicago (the other being the best burger in America at Au Cheval). In addition, as a native Texan, I don't take my smoked meats lightly, particularly the holy grail of smoked meats, the brisket. There's the context.

So of course I was excited to try the O.G. of Montreal-style smoked pastrami sandwiches (the Viande Fumée) in Montreal, the legendary Schwartz's. Long story short, it did not disappoint. Fresh off a healthy night of copious refreshments, our ragtag group sought something greasy and delicious, only to be met with a ridiculously long line squirreling out both ends at Schwartz's. Popular, this place apparently is. We deftly split into two, with a couple folks waiting in each line of roughly equal length. Spoiler alert: the to-go line moves much faster.

With a few bags of greasy-delicious sandwiches and a plethora of black cherry soda, we took a short hike to the nearest park, stole some seats on a bench, and promptly devoured the meatacular sandwiches. I'm sure it was quite a sight. 

Like Texas brisket, like Fumare's amazing sandwich, there's nothing special about the setup except for the tender loving care dedicated to producing the tenderest, most succulent, melts like butter, tastes like heaven, meat you can make. That's the rub at Schwartz's. It's all about the meat, and everything else is just dressing for show."}
{"text":"Wow. If there's one thing you must eat In Montréal it's this. 

I don't exaggerate when I say this is one of the best sandwiches I've had in my life. Even though it's very simple, the smoked meat melts in your mouth. It has a perfect flavor that's accentuated by the mustard, and doesn't need any other ingredients to spruce it up. 

At first I wrote Shwartz's off as a lame tourist trap and wasn't even going to stop in. Let me just say I am so, so glad I stopped in and that this is no tourist trap. The smoked meat sandwiches are really just that good. I'm so sad that this place is all the way up in Montréal, if I had one near me I would be there all the time."}
{"text":"Glad we did not wait in the line for a seat inside, because we had the best takeout order, two sandwiches topped with fires plus pickles. They were heaven."}
{"text":"I thought it was overrated. Boy, was I wrong! It was so so good! The meat was juicy and the thickness was perfect! I don't usually eat mustard and in this case, the mustard really brings out the smoked meat taste! 

We went really late at night so there was no line. I heard there's usually a big lineup so we were lucky. 

The decor was just like any deli place. 

I also saw that a lot of people ordered that cherry soda if I remember. 

It's worth it! If you never went there, try it at least once!!"}
{"text":"we arrived on a weekday sunday rainy late afternoon and our montreal friend was shocked at how short the line was. there were a few parties waiting to eat in but we decided to take advantage of their to go area and brought it back to our friend's apartment to eat leisurely. 

the smoked meat sandwich was inexpensive ($5.99) and smelled delicious but it's surprisingly small. i guess this is a must-try in montreal and the smoked meat sandwich was tasty enough, but not that impressed in terms of flavor or size compared to LA stops."}
{"text":"One of my worst experiences... too greasy and the place smells terrible."}
{"text":"Let me start by stating that I hardly ever crave or eat smoked beef; however I heard this place is a Montreal staple and the fam was eager to go.. We ordered the smoked beef/pastrami plate, pickles, fries and coleslaw.. I rate this place a 3.. again because pastrami is not my fav, but it was GOOD.. The fam loved it, finished every bite - seriously there was nothing left .. 

When we walked out there was a long line out the door.. A crowd is a good sign.. While I don't get it, many more do.. so I must be wrong."}
{"text":"If you love to queue for 30' min minimum - up to 1h 30\" on a busy day- you will enjoy the simple sandwiches on the classic sourdough. 

Indeed the deli meets are good , but NOT amazing like say true eastern european cold cuts, 
and same goes for the sandwiches they are good but definitely NOT worth the over 1 hour wait.
***** NOT WORTH THE WAIT******


Besides people shouldn't be packed inside like sardines in a can- on top of that caughing and sneezing - up and down the hall, by the counter. 
Let them wait close to the cashier and then outside. 
Even for contamination and health reasons, they should deliver and order online say 1 kg of roast beef should be possible in that case, if you don't plan to sit on the restaurant side but just have a take out.
Absolutely terrible organizing. 
Don't even they this place if you suffer from even the mildest case of Claustrophobia or don't want to feel like you queueing for your meat on the packed subway. Because that's what it is. Disgustingly packed caughing crowd. 


I give 2* because I liked the pickles and the lady in the front was nice. 


If you are Jewish or better have European heritage you will probably enjoy Stash cafe more, where you can sit down, get traditional pickled ( not vinegar pickled) pickles or a true cabbage, and a amazingly delicious potato latkes."}
{"text":"This place will offer you the best smoke meat in the city. You're paying a bit more for top quality meat!"}
{"text":"Every single person recommended I check this place out while in Montreal so of course you know I had to!

Luckily this was just a few doors down from Big in Japan and it served well for a late night snack!  At around 11:30pm (they close at 12:30am) this place was busy but not packed.  We found a table and I ordered their famous #4.  Smoked meat with mustard.  Simple.  Classic.

It took a few short minutes to bring out the sandwich.  It's nothing fancy, a lot of meat (but not so much that you can't fit the sandwich in your mouth), smear of mustard and bread.  But man....it tasted so good.  Juicy and hot - the 2 things I like best in my meat :)   Keeping things simple always is a plus in my books.   I really can't describe in words this place - you just need to come here and try if for yourself.  We did see they had poutine and were tempted to try it but it was late at night and we had already eaten dinner before so we stuck with the classic sandwich.  

The place itself looks like a worn out diner, but in a good way.  The menu is simple, the prices are decent and the service is fast.   Order and then pay at the front."}
{"text":"Tip: ask for a bit fat on your smoked meat.

Sandwich #4 (quarter pound smoked meat): 5/5. Tender, perfectly seasoned, not salty or bland, the fat isn't greasy but makes great fusion with the lean in terms of texture and aroma. 

Black cherry soda: 4/5. Thought it'd taste like Dr. Pepper but nooooooo it was good.

Poutine and coleslaw and pickle: 3.5/5. Not different from other standard diner."}
{"text":"Yes the smoked meat is good, actually it's great...
Definitely an interesting combination of 'real' MTL and equally (probably even more..) a highly touristy experience.
The line are ridiculous.  I would only go at 'off' times or squeeze around for take out counter. 
The staff is entertaining, sometimes grumpy, sometimes funny...
Remember this city has other great smoked meat spots.... Without the lines.  Montreal does not lack culinary experiences.  Unfortunately CASH ONLY (it's 2017!??!?!)."}
{"text":"I'll save you some waiting time by starting my review with a helpful note: you can skip the long line!  The line outside of Schwart's is for the small dine-in section of the main deli.  The building on the left has the same awning and is the take-out deli. The line inside is short and moves VERY rapidly as most people are purchasing packaged meat or smoked meat (aka pastrami) sandwiches to go.  A few people (like us) will notice that there are a few stools in the back of this deli against some counters for eating.  Short line and a place to sit?  Plus a restroom to wash hands afterwards?  Win-win!

My friend and I originally waited in the main line on a Sunday afternoon along with other tourists and then realized there was another door.  We went in, bought our smoked meat sandwiches ($9.60), cherry soda ($2.35), and poutine with smoked meats ($9.45), and sat in the back to enjoy Montreal's top pastrami sandwich.  In less than 10 minutes.

The sandwich looked pretty small when wrapped but once revealed, we were shocked at the amount of meat they stuffed between two small slices of bread.  (We should have just gotten 1 to share instead of 2.)  They also managed to squeeze in some yellow mustard.  Two people can definitely share one sandwich.  The poutine was rich and heavy, as expected.  It was so much food that we brought the poutine back to reheat for breakfast the next morning.

Unfortunately, the sandwich was more on the dry and salty side.  They got the smoky taste down but it's not as good as the pastrami in Katz's Deli back home (NYC).  

I loved the cork board in the back and all the love notes that people write on their paper napkins.  They're pretty fun to read as they are written in various languages, including pictures and stick figures."}
{"text":"It's a real good smoked meat. The hurry up and get out part is what irks me. That and the tourist line up on the weekends."}
{"text":"I have not found better smoked meat in my life (yet)...

Every time I visit, I have to drop by at least to pick up a sandwich for the ride home, and a couple of pounds of smoked meat to savour over the week with my family.

It is always packed with lineups. I think the fastest experience was roughly 15 minutes without having to wait in line for take-out. I've yet to have a sit-down meal in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food but certainly not as good as the Jewish deli's in NY and not worth the over one hour wait in 90+ degree weather on the street to get in and get a table.  Lots of hype!

The place is incredibly small and you have to pay cash.  If you pay with USD then they charge an extra 10% fee!"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal and heard about a New York style deli.  Had to try it out as Carnegie Deli closed.  We had the standard smoked beef sandwich, which close to under-spiced pastrami.  The sandwich was like Canadian $9.75 or $7.50 in US.  Great value compared to what you get in NYC.  Taste was good, but sort of what you expect.  There are many tourists there, apparently all heard about it, taking away some of the fun.  But it's a deli, eat you sandwich and get going!"}
{"text":"I heard that this was the spot to go to for smoked meats. The sandwiches have ALOT of meat so don't eat for  24 hours before you get it if you intend to finish it. I'm still working on mine as I write this review. The smoked meat is really good. The bread is small though and it would be nice if there was more mustard. Other than that, I still think that you should head over there, grab a sandwich, pick up some of the spice mixes that they sell for meats."}
{"text":"How dare I give this place less than a 4 right?  How dare you cant admit the wait time is stupid.  Ratings of restaurants are for the whole experience.  And my Hanger experience here is not fun.  Ok their smoked meat is very very good.   Hand cut, and nothing wrong with it.  This place loses 2 stars because honestly its just stupid to wait hours for a table.  I would barely wait 2 hours in line if I needed a kidney transplant let alone to sit down and eat a sandwich.  Just go to the takeout area.  Their Karnatzel is the best i've ever had.  Get it dry.  The taste of the meat stick in your mouth is amazing and makes you just want to be a meat stick prostitute.
Why doesn't yelp have half stars.  This is another key example were a half star is needed.  Its a 3.5.  Has anyone Yelped Yelp?  For the record I give yelp a 3 until they change and offer half stars."}
{"text":"Was told a smoked meat sandwich at Schwartz's was a no doubt must-do in Montreal so decided to check it out. Sandwich was fine but definitely nothing outstanding. The smoked meat itself is a pretty nice flavor, but served on a thin piece of rye bread and plain yellow mustard. That's it.

Was cool to try a landmark spot but nothing I'd wait in line for again."}
{"text":"Still the best smoked meat.  Been coming here for almost 20 years.  The Schwartz combo, which comes with Rib Steak and mini hot dogs is what I've been taking forever, but I miss the old grill, with its decades of accumulated taste, which seemed to make the rib steak even tastier.  If you like red meat, you'll be happy.  The interior is completely unpretentious mid-20th century white bathroom tile.  If you want fancy, go up the street to Moishe's, or queue de Cheval, or better yet Gibby's.  Be prepared to share tables with other patrons.  Think more dine and dash than sip and savour.  Don't come in peak hours if you don't like waiting in a queue outside on St. Laurent.  Be prepared for brutally honest waiters, who will guide you towards the red meat.  Don't get lean smoked meat, it's a freaking travesty.  If you want to cut calories, skip the bread, or dump the fries (although they are not bad), just for the love of god, don't go lean on the smoked meat."}
{"text":"The food is okay and is not pricy, but I feel it's not worthy for the long waiting..."}
{"text":"if you are looking for the best smoked meat ever you've come to the right place."}
{"text":"Its just ordinary smoked meat. The place is very crowded and there is usually a huge waiting line outside the door. I dont get why its so popular. I do like their tea though."}
{"text":"i've been to Montreal maybe 6 times in my life, and every time I go, I make a stop by Schwartz to grab a smoked meat sandwich, and a brisket to bring back home. I've never been to any other deli in Montreal and although they might be just as good, I have no problems with Schwartz. Bread, mustard, smoked meat. What more do you need? it's delicious."}
{"text":"When you think about Smoked Meat Sandwiches, you think Schwartz's. But then you  think long lineups, Meh ambiance & a loud dining area where everything smells like Smoked Meat. That said, Schwartz's makes the best Smoked Meat sandwiches No question about it. A pound of smoked meat stacked in between rye bread with a dash of mustard. What's not to like about it. You have an option of askin for lean meat. But leaner the meat, less juicer it is, not to mention less tasty. Also get the pickle. This is a cash only establishment so make sure you are carrying cash. They do have an ATM in the back (But you end up paying 2.50 for a transaction)


Food -  Great
Service - Ok
Ambiance - What you talkin bout Willis
Worth the money - AwwwwwYeaaaaahhhh"}
{"text":"This is one of the places I ALWAYS VISIT when I am in Montreal!!  In fact, buying their sandwiches to-go is one of our rituals! My wife runs in while I keep the engine running and when she jumps back into the car we make a run for it (i.e. sit & park somewhere). This is heaven on earth for guys!! If you can actually get this baby in your mouth without pulling it apart, man, you have a big and powerful mouth (and your wife must love you deeply). While in Montreal, the prospect of heading over to Schwartz's multiple times looms large! \"Midnight?\"
Time to see if they are still open! Heading back to the States...You'll need something for the 80MPH run... and the guys at the border do not care about a sandwich! (I've keep it in plain sight and tell them, \"Yes, I am importing some meat to USA-- in the form of a sandwich!!) Schwartz's is wonderful and the price is awesome for what you get!! $9.00 Canadian Dollars in less than you'll pay for yucky fast food in the States. Man, being back home is nice.... yet I miss my sandwich supplier."}
{"text":"It was so good we went here twice during our 4 days stay in this city. Ordering to go was quick and painless. However, I did overhear the waiter talking and being douchey to some tourist that were dining in."}
{"text":"Un grand classique de Montréal. Honnêtement le meilleur sandwich de viande fumée que j'ai pu goûter jusqu'à présent. L'attente vaut le coup. Il s'agit là d'un endroit quelque peu mythique ou il faut déjeuner au moins une fois dans sa vie."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the most delicious smoked meat you'll find! 

The line-up to get a seat in this place stretched down the road, so my beau and I decided to head into their take out section next door and grab a seat  by the back window (recommended!). I am not normally a big beef person and initially ordered a turkey sandwich. \"This is the same turkey you can get anywhere,\" the guy said to me. \"Including in Toronto--that's where you're from right?\"

Was it that obvious? He said 80 per cent of their customers come from Toronto, but it was my dialect that gave it away. 

He talked me into getting the smoked meat, so I ordered it skinny and man was I glad I did! It was so tasty and tender it was as if it had been cooking in a crockpot for days. It literally fell apart in my mouth. Since it was \"skinny\" it wasn't fat at all, which was especially nice because I am typically picky and girly in these matters. Seriously, it was so good it almost made me wonder why I spend the majority of my life pseudo-vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Perhaps my expectations were set a little too high before going to Schwartz's.  After 38 raving Yelp reviews, guide book articles and recommendations from locals, I was expecting to be blown away.

Unfortunately, I wasn't.

Yes, the smoked meat at Schwartz's is pretty good.  Damn good, actually.  The rest of my experience was subpar at best.

Every time we drove by, the restaurant was full and there was a line out the door at least three parties deep.  That's always a good sign, but given that it was about 7 degrees outside, we opted to pass by each time.  But on our final day we spotted a second door next to the restaurant: \"Schwartz's To Go.\"  So we parked and headed inside.

Inside was a takeout counter with some tables and chairs in back.  We took a number, waited in line, and placed our order.  Unfortunately, they were out of nearly everything on the menu, which was pretty limited to begin with (it was about 5:00 in the afternoon on a Saturday).  All they had was beef and turkey, so we got a beef sandwich, a turkey sandwich and fries.  Then we waited in another line to hand our receipt to the guys making sandwiches.  Then we waited in a third line to pick up the sandwiches.

Ravenously hungry, we dug into the fries as soon as we got in the car, but they were terrible; cold (it'd been less than 5 minutes since they were put in the bag), soggy and limp.  Very disappointing.

When we got back to the hotel and unwrapped the sandwiches, I was surprised at what I saw - two thin, soggy pieced of white bread surrounding about three inches of meat.  That was it.  So we dispensed of the soggy bread and dug right into the meat.  

THAT'S where the reward was - tender, juicy, BURSTING with flavor.  It was pretty awesome.

In hindsight, I should have dispensed with the extras at Schwartz's and just bought the smoked meat by the pound.  Them I needed to visit Marche Atwater for some fresh bread and produce, and make myself a real sandwich.  THAT will be the plan next time."}
{"text":"The food was alright...the meat was a bit on the fatty side for my liking.  They didn't have poutine by dinner on a Sunday night.  The service was horrible...our server was mean and only took our order, brought water once..and then the bill.  This place is cash only and you pay up front so I was shocked when the cashier asked me to leave a tip (which against my better judgement I did).  Then she got angry because she didn't like the amount I left..well in the U.S. tips aren't automatic..you have to actually give decent service to get a great tip.  This place seems more like a tourist trap...I'd go somewhere else for smoked meat."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich. Pickle. Fries. What a meal! Everything was perfect. Meat piled high on rye bread with mustard, plate of perfectly cooked and seasoned fries, and a nice sour pickle. If you want a light lunch, split the sandwich with a friend. It's really not as big as it looks in the photos! 

We waited in line for only a few minutes before being offered seats at the counter. 

The whole time I'm sitting there wondering what animal smoked meat comes from, but not wanting to ask. It's not any of the reviews on Yelp that I could find, and I've never seen it in Portland. I was way too afraid to ask, and it took a fair amount of Googling to find out that it's corn beef that's been slowly smoked and heavily seasoned with a variety of seasonings. It's delicious is what it is. 

Great service. The guy who helped us was hilarious. At the end of the meal he asked us if we were ready for dessert. 'What do you have?' 'More meat!' We may not have been ready then, but we sure are now!"}
{"text":"Cash only.  The smoked beef is amazing.  The waiter kindly led us through our first experience - I would recommend just asking them for their advice and doing what they say.  There was a line when we arrived but it moved quickly.  Prepare for a quick, good meal.  We would definitely eat there again - prices were affordable, portions were filling, food was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is probably at the top of most Montreal tourists' lists. Old school Jewish deli specializing in a Montreal favorite, smoked brisket.

I had the fatty brisket, with a pickle on the side. The meat itself was only lightly smoky, but very tender. I used more of the mustard for an extra kick. The pickle was a heavy style pickling. 

And of course, you're to wash it all down with the black cherry cola. A cheap and fast meal at this Montreal institution."}
{"text":"wowwwwwwza.

reasonably priced. packed. melt in your mouth goodness.

vegetarians beware! and don't ask for corned beef!

this place is all about the meat lovers. my bf and i made a point to stop here twice on our vacay. 

the smoked meat sandwich is where its at. i get it lean with lots of mustard on delicious rye and a coke. 

it doesnt get much better than this!"}
{"text":"It's a must go... if you haven't been to Katz. Solid smoked meat joint with a very devote following (our waiter got upset when my friend mentioned that the placed had changed hands- which it had) would've liked some russian dressing and surprised no spicy mustard!"}
{"text":"Excellent, la viande est très tendre et bien parfumée et la moutarde a un gout différent des moutardes américaine habituelle un incontournable a Montréal."}
{"text":"C'est un tout.

Quand on rentre à l'intérieur, on comprend pourquoi c'est une institution. On dirait que le temps s'est arrêté.. Une déco qui n'a jamais changé qui donne tout le charme au lieu, l'odeur de la Smoked Meat me fait presque baver.

On partage la table avec les autres clients, on discute le temps d'un repas alors que dans la rue on aurait même pas échangé un regard.

La Smoked Meat est délicieuse. Jamais décevante. C'est juste excellent.

Je le conseille  un lendemain de grosse soirée bien alcoolisé. haha! ça fait un bien fou."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich is so good here! Better than Main across the street. I always order a pickle and fries to compliment the sandwich. It's very popular and always crowded but service is good and fast. We're lucky we never had to wait on line out of 3 late night visits."}
{"text":"I recommend eating here just as much for the food as the ambiance and cachet.  Seems like the best deal, especially for 2-4 people, is to get the regular or grande plate of meat, which comes with bread for you to make your own sandwiches, vs paying $10CA for an individual sandwich.

Decor is great, and servers have cool, efficient-and-friendly-attitude no matter how jam-packed the place gets.  The smoked beef is very tasty. 

Word of advice: skip the poutine here.  Pretty lackluster, spend your $,time, and stomach space on a place that specializes in it."}
{"text":"The wait is ridiculous....I have no patience...and it's just a sandwich...I'm not waiting more than an hour....so low and behold- next door is take out! You get to wait there too...but much faster. Meats are delicious. You MUST go here when you visit Montreal...every time :)"}
{"text":"Too famous! Always lining up! Smoked meat was good but not that impressive. Turkey was too salty... When I ordered turkey sandwich, the staff was looking at me curiously. It seemed to express why u don't choose smoked meat, everybody wants the smoked meat... Fine, it just has to check when travel around Montreal. But truly delicious food are more than it. After taking a photo with the sandwich, I want to say: Montreal smoked meat, Checked!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend kept mentioning smoked meat the whole ride up to Montreal. I didn't know what he was blabbing about until we arrived here. There was a long line full of tourists waiting to get in. I peer in and say 'There is no way we're waiting just for this smoked meat'. The restaurant was small and crapped. I didn't have a problem with that, I loved the old deli style charm. It was just that line. The host/bouncer announces 'if you don't want to wait on line for table service, go next door and order take out'. And that's what we did!
The boyfriend ducks next door and I follow. There was a line, but it was quickly moving. I head to the back where there was a small seating area and grab 2 stools. 10 minutes later, he walks towards me, with a greasy brown paper bag and huge grin.
We tare into the bag, he ordered a smoked meat sandwich and a side of fries. The meat it self was tender and juicy, but I felt it needed something and slithered on some mustard from a nearby squeeze bottle. Fries were a little soggy but also crisp. We both agreed that it was good and continued stuffing our face.
So good, we decided to make a run days later to pick up another one for our train ride home."}
{"text":"Parking was easy and thankfully it wasn't super full. We sat down quickly and ordered two smoked meat sandwiches and a plate of fries. Food came super fast. Sandwiches we're warm and yummy, lots of meat stuffed between two slices of fresh bread. Great atmosphere and friendly wait staff. Will be back!"}
{"text":"There is one side you can order to take it to go and the other side is a sit down restaurant to eat at. We opted to take it to go. Went on a weekday afternoon and wasn't a line. Got the smoked meat sandwich which was packed with meat but was slightly dry."}
{"text":"Schwartz's was founded by Reuben Schwartz back in 1928, and the same location still pumps out the smoked meat that uses the original recipe of spices.  The hubs and I came here late in the evening to check them out.  We sat at the counter and ordered a Smoked Meat sandwich with mustard on rye bread.  There was a generous amount of the smoked meat, which tasted pretty much like corned beef, with slightly of an off-taste to it.  Not too much fat, but I was curious as I've heard that you can request the different levels of fat (that wasn't offered to us).  It would have been nice to have more rye bread slices, or the option to request some more.  There is a bottle mustard on the counter, though, for convenience sakes.  Service was friendly, when available; however, the guys behind the counter seemed more transfixed in socializing and not really tending to the patrons dining-in. The place is cramped and there were many people dining in; however, I had an issue with the strong urine odor in the dining area, so that can definitely lead to appetite loss.  Cash only, and you pay up at the front.  Just note that if you plan on getting there early, smoked meat does not get served until after 10:30 AM.

+Smoked Meat sandwich = underwhelming
+strong urine odor in the restaurant (!!!)

{"text":"I really loved this restaurant. Not only is it cozy but the attention is really good as well. If is your first time you come here you should take the traditional dish. Smoked meat sandwich, frites, pickles and a cherry cola. Couldn't be better combination.  I assure if you come you won't regret it. Regarding price I think for the cost is more than worth it."}
{"text":"Had a slight wait getting in. Ordered the smoked meat sandwich and it was super tender! The mustard gave it a slight tang. Really good."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, enjoyed this.

Had the standard smoked meat sandwich, fries - and I tried to have a cherry cola too, after my son pointed it out.  He didn't want a cherry cola himself, so I picked on  up.  (There's a point here.  Keep reading.)

Sandwich was great.  Fries were out of this world.  Never got to try the cherry cola and my son stole it.  Yes, I was annoyed.  Next time I'm going to Montreal he's simply not invited.  :-\

Note:  They have no patience for newbs - watch the people before you to figure out about ordering and what's what.

Would I recommend:  Yes
Would I return:  Yes.

Wish we hadn't been in such a rush - would have been nice to have taken some time to walk up and down the street they are on, looked like it might be interesting shopping.  Next time!"}
{"text":"Great stuff, absolutely delectable, juicy and succulent smoked meat sandwiches!  Served on classic rye bread (no other options, mind you) and with a side of fries/poutine/pickles etc., this old school sandwich place has set the standard for smoked meat around the world!

Certainly a 5 star rating because I honestly haven't had any better smoked meat and thoroughly admire this small jewish establishment's cherished history and strong adherence to what they believe in.

Long lines, all the time .. so come with a book or a group of friends!  Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars so bad!!! But I have to consider quality business and customer service. This place is iconic and deserves the attention it gets. It is downplayed by the locals as simply a tourist joint but having tried other smoked meat sandwich places this is easily the best.

So the deduction of the star comes from their fame and long lines with no adaption. I know the reason is not due to revenue shortage cause this place is packed all day long. Open a second location or expand! It's simple business practice. You may not want to grow but your customers do so open that other location and donate all the proceeds to the mass of homeless if you don't want the money. 

Anyway, if your in a rush go in the to go side but your still looking at a 15 minute wait at least. All worth it in the end!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches when you order inside but I had pick up 3 times so far and it's not the same at all. The line is intimidating but it goes pretty fast. Last time I went they had no mayonnaise which I need for my fries. But overall very good meals"}
{"text":"Try this place during a week night or when weather is bad, so that you can actually sit and enjoy your food.

Definitely recommended if you like beef ;)"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I don't completely get the smoked meat obsession. Sure, it's a fine thing, but I've had smoked meat at Schwartz's and Dunn's and I'd be hard pressed to tell you the difference. I also don't at all understand the raves about the cherry soda. It's just another fructose-laced soft drink. 

That said, this is a very fine place. The sandwich was tasty and generous. The atmosphere just screams \"We're an authentic place that's been around for over 80 years. We do one thing really well and we're damn proud of it.\"

Definitely a must stop on a Montreal stay."}
{"text":"A simple old school place.
Therefore I will write a simple review.
Very good meat on very nice soft rye bread with the perfect amount of mustard.
Pickles were tasty as well and the older staff were funny as well.
Really wish they had something of this quality in Toronto 

Cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"I don't think this place needs more reviews, none the less i will add mine. I rarely give 5 stars but this place is legendary for good reason. Best smoke meat in the world, bar none.

The atmosphere is pleasantly retro and the staff is courteous and efficient (despite the crazy crowds).

My go to place for deli food!"}
{"text":"Great place for a smoked meat sandwich!!  There was a LONG line, but thankfully it was just two of us so we got to cut to the front.  

My husband got their fatty smoked meat sandwich, and I got their medium smoked meat sandwich- the fatty is definitely better!  Served on fresh rye bread with a little smear of mustard.  We also got a plate of fries to share."}
{"text":"This is the quintessential Jewish delicatessen probably in all of Canada.  The Katz Deli of Canada.  An institution.  The place is a complete dump but that part of the charm.  You go to this place for one thing.  A smoked meat sandwich, kind of like corned beef but a little different.  

You order a smoked meat sandwich on rye with mustard.  You will NOT be disappointed and it costs 7 or 8 bucks.  You can't beat it.  

If you visit Montreal you have to go to this place.  there will be a wait because it is so good.  Don't forget to order a deli pickle with your sandwich.  They have a special recipe, probably the best one I have ever had.  

Thanks"}
{"text":"Amazing pastrami sandwich. It looked small but it is extremely filling. I didn't know that there is a separate takeout store right beside the main entrance. I waited an extra 10 minutes at the dine-in line before being told to go next door where there was no line at all for the same food to go."}
{"text":"There really isn't that much I can say that hasn't been said with soo many reviews for Schwartz's already.

As such, I'll give advice more than a review.

Line-up outside Schwartz's? - Option 1: Takeout Counter

Depending on when you go, there can be quite a line up outside the door.  If you just want a smoked meat sandwich, fries and a pickle, you can save yourself a lot of time by just going to the takeout counter.  The prices are the same and they have some seating at the back so you can still sit and eat (while saving yourself about 30 minutes to an hour in line).

Line-up outside Schwartz's? - Option 2: Eat across the street

If you want a full sit down experience (i.e. more menu choices), I have to say I'd recommend going across the street to the Main Deli Steak House.  The smoked meat sandwich is just as good (and in my opinion, better), the service is good, and there is no line.

I guess if I head down to Montreal and I'm in the neighborhood, I'll check it out again but I don't know if I'd go to Schwartz's or Main Deli Steak House."}
{"text":"I've never had Montreal smoked meat before, and didn't expect much.
A simple sandwich with:
-corned beef, mustard, between slices of white bread.

It was mouth-wateringly delicious. Highly recommended for tourists. 

Super busy, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"At the time of writing, I've been here on 3 occasions already. And I love it!

Their specialty, the smoked meat sandwich, is so good I almost cry. The juicy, tender meat; the right amount of fat... such delicious, very schwartz, wow.

Food preparation is fast and service is friendly. Sometimes the waiters strike up a chat with you and ask where you're from and what events you're attending today. Yes, they speak both English and French well.

This place is popular for a reason. A lot of my friends have been there, and I have too. Sometimes I'd even run into them randomly at the restaurant!

The decorations within the restaurant are unfortunate in my opinion. Instead of having a clean design, they opted to plaster all the walls with newspaper clippings of all the times they were featured, and also coverage of celebrities visiting the place. On the one hand I acknowledge the history and reputation of this place, but on the other hand this display was just too loud and in-your-face. When I visited for the first time and hadn't experienced the excellent food, the self-promotion gave me a negative feeling. But now I understand why.

Just a note, the restaurant takes cash only. It seems most young people prefer to use debit or credit card as much as possible and avoid cash."}
{"text":"Schwartz's was recommended by a friend as a \"to do\" while visiting Montreal. We had to stand on line about 15 minutes before we were seated. Not too difficult a wait. Place was pretty small may 50 seats. The menu is limited but the \"smoked meat\" is what anyone comes to schwartz's for. It was really really good. I ordered the fries &  smoked meat sandwich which is comparable to pastrami. Fatty goodness. 

People don't go to this place for the atmosphere, you go for the smoked meat. And it was well worth the $10 buck cab ride from my hotel to check out a food institution in Montreal."}
{"text":"Overrated! A tourist trap. Yes the meat is good but it's not great, and definitely not worth the wait/cash only greed/rushed rude service. Plenty of other smoked beef places around Montreal that aren't slimy rip offs. PS, they give the option of paying US dollars to rip you off even more. They claim they are doing 10% surcharge for the exchange  but it's actually closer to 25% so don't fall for their second tourist trap inside their bigger tourist trap."}
{"text":"I have tried Katz's at least twice.  I have been to Montreal close to 10 times.  This was my first time at Schwartz's.  The famous smoked meat was dry and grainy.  The fatty sections were tastier. It does not even come close to Katz's.  It needs some kind of sauce.  It is about 1/3 the price of Katz's pastrami sandwich which is the only positive.  The service is prompt, positive and courteous.  The restaurant has an exciting atmosphere.  The fries are sweet but it has too much oil!  The cole slaw is made of water and not mayonnaise.  The pickels are old and sour.  

I have crossed this place off my things to do list for good.

Why people stand outside on line for more than 30 minutes to eat at this place is beyond me!"}
{"text":"Must try in Montreal! Service and food was amazing. We shared the smoked meat sandwich (choice between fatty, medium, lean- we opted for medium) as we were already quite full. The bread was soft with a thin mustard spread, and a generous heaping of quarter pound of smoked meat sandwiched in between. Simple and delicious! 

You can also order additional smoked meat by weight which was what we did, this time opting for a mix of the  fatty and medium. Wow, the fatty smoked was perfection-super juicy and well seasoned. 

Obviously, we paired it with a pickle and a cherry coke for tradition's sake. Service was amazing!  Efficient, they know what they're doing and our server had a lovely radio voice. We loved it!  Also, don't forget to walk down to Ana's bakery to end your meal with a sweet pastry!

TIP: we came at odd hours, before dinner and it was raining. We did not have to wait for a table!"}
{"text":"i understand this is an old school place, and they even have a musical named after it ( see the poster outside the store). But after trying the most famous corn beef sandwich, i really couldn't understand what's so hype about this place. The meat is not very moist and lack of flavor, maybe their old owner had a better recipe?

not going back again for sure. but as a tourist, maybe u should still give it a chance just to review the history~~"}
{"text":"La réputation de Schwartz n'est plus à refaire. C'est une institution,  on y croise à différentes heures de la journée dans ce petit resto qui a su garder son cachet des personnes de tout horizons qui partagent la même envie manger de la bonne viande fumée,  la meilleure!"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal visiting and heard about Schwartz so we decided to go. It was out of the way and the food was overpriced. They have their signature smoked meat sandwich which was good, but not worth $10 especially since it was pretty small and only had mustard on it. You will be paying for the reputation and bragging rights of saying you've been to Schwartz."}
{"text":"Just recently had some of their smoked meat, and its was incredibly good. My friend had been to Montreal on the weekend and brought some back for me. Even though it was cold and had to be reheated, it was delicious! I can't even begin to fathom what it would taste like if it was fresh and hot...This is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Best smoke meat ever, that it. Every time i go Montreal i have to stop there. It's just a must-to-try and you will fall in love"}
{"text":"Just grabbed a take out smoked meat sandwich and a pickle to eat out on the street. The sandwich was great and the pickle was awesome. It's a nice neighbourhood to enjoy a meal outside."}
{"text":"This is obv a tourist jaunt, but no matter. The smoked meat was really good.  Akin to Katz or Sarges or similar goodness in NYC Jewish delis. (I still prefer Katz - just had it the other day). What shocked me most was the price. Only $6 for a sandwich loaded with meat? That's about a third of the NYC prices. Wow. Me like. 

If u don't wanna wait in line 10 to 30 minutes, u can go next door to their takeout section and eat it standing up. One sandwich and half an order of fries should fill you up."}
{"text":"This joint is a long-time main stay. Opened in 1928, this is the oldest deli in all of Canada. There was a 30 minute wait for their outside seating, which was nothing special. Metal chairs, long plastic table-clothed tables under a makeshift cheap awning. Inside seating was open already, so we went with the latter. Besides, it was rather hot (in the 80s), so no complaining here. 

The eatery is a small space. There's old dinner bar stool seating and communal tables down the other side. Chatting with the gal beside me, she's from Paris, but's living in Montreal. She expressed how Montreal is a tourist city, yes, but old restaurants like Schwartz is engrained in the fabric of society. 

Our waiter informed us you can order medium or lean. This refers to the amount of fat you want on the shaved meat. Our waiter recommended medium, so when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

It's on the smaller size, circumference-wise. But packed high with the tender as hell beef. The original simply has plain ol yellow mustard, nothing more. The bread is soft and airy, leaves optimal room for the protein!!

The best smoked beef sandwich I've ever chomped on! The taste will forever remain ingrained on my tongue."}
{"text":"If you're in Montreal, you must, must go to this place. I actually saw this place on Trip Advisory, with well over 1k of positive reviews. There's usually a line-up so I went first thing in the morning. They start service at 10:30am and even then, the tourist (like me) were already starting to pack in.

I came back the next couple of days but was discouraged by the long line outside. What I found out though is the line is for the sit-in. They have a store beside them that does take-outs only and there is no line-up. Well, depending on the time you go, I guess, but it's not comparable to the dine in. 

When you order, you can ask for fatty, medium or lean meat. I got the medium fatty because to me, the fat makes it tastier. When I got the smoked sandwich, I thought it looked too small, but it was a satisfying amount. Also, I overheard the waiter that if you're buying a platter of meat, they charge extra dollar per person. That, or you all order your own stuff. I can understand why. They're a pretty small restaurant and they get a lot of people waiting to sit in. 

They also accept US dollars, and they have a sign of their conversion rate, so that's cool too. 

I'm not big on deli, but I've had my share and I say that hands down, this is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"WOW! This place definitely lives up to its hype. The smoked meat sandwich was amazing. However my favorite thing was the poutine with smoked meat, Out of this world. This is a must try if your in montreal."}
{"text":"To my surprise, there was no line when I went (11 AM on a Saturday in March)! I got two smoked meat sandwiches and two pickles for me and my husband. The sandwiches were so rich that we could've split one. Next time I'll get extra mustard to cut through some of the fattiness. I'm glad we had the experience!"}
{"text":"Super efficient seating arrangements and a lot of hype as seen from the line and from a couple of friends that had visited Montreal before. But I definitely wasn't blown away by the smoked meat sandwich. Meat was overall a bit dry, and not necessarily the most flavorful. Staff was also pretty rude, but I guess your service can take a hit if you're that famous of a restaurant. As a New Yorker, I'd much rather spend my time at Katz than to take a second visit to Schwartz's."}
{"text":"They make a great \"corned beef\" sandwich. If you are in the area-go have lunch here but don't make special trip, and don't wait in a line that's too long.  Lunch for 1 including sandwich, pickle and fries for less than $10."}
{"text":"Get the smoked meat sandwich! It's spiced so well! The line for the regular restaurant moved quickly, but it was even faster to sit on the bar stools in the back of the take-out area. There's a door several meters to the left of the main door. That also gives you the chance to come up with a \"napkin note\" to post on the bulletin board."}
{"text":"My smoked meat sandwich was a solid 3 stars.....it was good, but for my tastes it wasn't spiced nearly enough; and some of the meat was chewier than I like. Worth a try, sure, but if you're seeking out the mother of all smoked meat sandwiches, I'm sure you can find better in Montreal. (But if you do come here, the dark cherry pop is a must.)"}
{"text":"There's a reason people line up in the frigid cold and blistering heat for the famous smoked meat sandwich at Schwartz's. Over-hyped? I think not! ...unless you detest savoury smoked meat. Each time I've been here, the food has been on point and the service good enough for a place as busy as this. 

A bite of their smoked meat sandwich, accompanied with pickle and washed down with cherry coke will make you see the words written in the sky by airplane - life is good!"}
{"text":"This is a review of the food that I got, and a bit of the service I saw when I walked in to see what was taking so long. My friends raved about this place, and I can understand why from the food that we got. We got a smoked meat, extra fatty. It was very good, but I'm sure my heart attack is not too far behind. Anyways, my biggest gripe was when I walked in for a minute, and this might be my own perception, but the fat guy with glasses who worked there seemed like he was a total dick. He said thank you to my friends, but while he said it, he tapped the tip plate. I wasn't too sure what I had walked into, but I wanted to keep an open mind about the situation. The place looked like a regular small diner with a butcher located near the front. This same fat guy with glasses looked outside and snarled his face towards my direction when we left (mind you, we left a tip after his words and actions), but I'm not too sure if he did so for his disgust at us (because we're Americans?) or because it was raining heavily. From what my friends told me, my observations about this fat guy being a dick were correct, but they are not from my own experiences, so my perceived perception with a grain of salt. Sandwich is very tasty, though very greasy."}
{"text":"Schwartz from what I heard from others who've visited Montreal say it's a must. Not being a meat eater I accompanied my boyfriend to this restaurant that's been serving smoked meat sandwiches since the 20s. The size of the sandwich was smaller than I thought but it was filled with a LOT of meat.  A little pricey in my opinion but then again I didn't eat it but I've heard great things. My boyfriend being from New York said it reminded him of Katz. I asked him which was better he said Katz but that may be a little biased."}
{"text":"On my recent first trip to Montreal, a close Quebecois friend of mine INSISTED that we make a stop at Schwartz, noting it to be the best smoked deli place there is.  As he is a native of the region, I trusted his instincts, as I am all about trying new places that are local and provide an excellent selection of foods.

Soooo, one day after work...Schwartz it was.  From Rue de la Montagne, we even walked approximately 35 minutes to get to Schwartz via Sherbrooke.  And if this means anything to you reading this...it was well worth it.  I would have walked 8 more miles if I had to, considering the amazing smoked meat on those sandwiches, laid back neighborhood friendly atmosphere, and very reasonable prices.

Upon entering, because this place had no available table, we opted to go sit at the \"bar\".  No, there is no liquor service here, just amazing food.  Once seated, the guy behind the counter immediately started asking for our orders, for which we opted for combo smoked sandwiches, orders of fries, and cherry cola for me.

When the sandwiches arrived, we were all focused and quiet, devouring our food.  I personally preferred tasting every bite, as this was indeed a very tasty treat.  Just enough fat, topped with a tad of mustard, and wrapped in freshly baked bread.  Simple, tasty, delicious!  Sometimes, keeping things simple is the way to go.

What's next?  I must go back next time to try their other smoked treats.  now I have an excuse to venture back to visit our neighbors up north!"}
{"text":"Delicious old stand-by deli.

It's a great classic deli.

You get it the way they make it. Don't raise a fuss!  :)"}
{"text":"When I am visiting a city I have never been before, I try to make a list of places to check out as well local eats in advance. However, thanks to NYC, I generally leave thinking that I have had better ones. This place was an exception.

Don't be scared of the line outside. Unless you are a party of 4+, the average wait is 1.25 minutes per person ahead of you (yes, I am an engineer), and you won't regret waiting. Also the service is pretty fast inside.

You don't need to get all the extra things the servers are trying to make you have. Just get the smoked beef sandwich for a great experience."}
{"text":"Last night my friend and I tried to end a night on St. Laurent Blvd with a late night snack at what most would call the holy temple of smoked meat....but no the employees decided to close up shop early. That's right before closing at 130am they were done at 120am the exact time we showed up and refused to serve us or even let us in the famous establishment. How ridiculous!?! Don't advertise that you will be open and have your employees close early! 

I have been to Shwartz's and other delis in Montreal and NYC many times and let me tell you first hand that Shwartz's is also the dirtiest. Often the floor appears to be dirty and the bathroom is always a complete mess you would be lucky if you found soap in the dispensers. Simply disgusting that now the same employees who close up early might not even be using proper sanitation. 

Don't get me wrong their sandwich still tops the list for best smoked meat. However, if you're looking for a real MTL style smoked meat sandwich with better service and cleanliness head over to Lester's and Mile End in NYC."}
{"text":"If you like smoked meat and dive restaurants, you cannot go wrong with Schwartz's. First, there is ALWAYS a line outside so don't let that stop you from choosing to eat here. Wait in the line, it's worth the wait.
The place is full of Schwartz's Montreal history all over the walls with newspaper clippings and photos of all of the famous people who have visited this place. It's very cozy inside, you'll be sitting right next to people, but you'll be served fast. 
I always get the lean smoked meat sandwich with the pickle and fries on the side and am satisfied every time. If you're visiting, you can go next door and buy yourself some of their meat to take home."}
{"text":"I think it's better than Katz's in New York, and quite a lot cheaper (you'll pay about $10 canadian after tax and tip...). I don't want to admit it but Montreal beats NYC on this one (the bagels, though, are another matter).

You go in, they'll seat you, and take your order (if your first time I recommend the sandwich). They'll bring it to you quickly, you'll eat it in a few delicious bites, and you leave satisfied and happy. The wall decorations are nice too, with lots of articles and clippings about their fame."}
{"text":"Came for the famous Montreal smoke meat sandwich and   Schwartz was the place to come. It is famous for a good reason and the pickles and slaw were nice compliments to the sandwich. Fries were nice and crispy.

Cash only and the tables turn quickly so do'nt be afraid if it is lined up at the door.

Very good and attentive service."}
{"text":"We rented bikes at Procycle in Levis, Quebec. The one bicycle broke and they refused to give us a full refund after just 20 min. of biking. These were old bikes in the attic and were not maintained."}
{"text":"So it was our last night in Montreal. We'd done the fancy dinner thing. We'd been to a few clubs. We had some crepes. It was down to our last dinner in town so we asked the concierge, \"If there was one place you'd say we HAD to try before heading back to the States, where would it be?\"

With little to no hesitation, he said:
SCHWARTZ.
And then he proceeded to warn it was not a \"classy place.\" He explained the whole 'smoked meat' phenomenon, which sparked an entire cab ride of lewd jokes revolving around meat smoking. Ha - and the concierge was worried about classy.

It was refreshing to see this family owned and operated, bare bones shop serving solid platefuls of meat, classic french fries and giant deli pickles. There was absolutely no way I could finish my sandwich (I swear there must have been a pound of meat on there) and I left with a big, full-belied grin on my face.

Sitting at the counter is the only way to go, as the owner (manager?) chatted us up about our trip, explained the ordering process to us and was just genuinely glad to have us at his establishment. For the experience and the service, I can't even say I minded the cash-only thing!"}
{"text":"The King of smoked meat.  Get ready to line up though.  Remember it's kosher so if you want cheese on your sandwich fuggedaboutit!"}
{"text":"No credit cards or notice until your check arrives.
The line was down the block and quickly moving for smoked meat sandwiches (no pastrami-no corned beef just smoked meat) at lunchtime. Schwartz's really packs the folks in at community tables.
$30 for two sandwiches, one pickle($2.50), and two cans of soda. The meat was a little dry (we ordered medium fat), the bread was also a little dry. A smallish sized sandwich. My husband and I both had stomach problems shortly thereafter but we can say we've been there and done that."}
{"text":"Smoked Meat sandwich with pickle was small but filling. Favorite was the Smoked Meat Poutine. The service was excellent and friendly. Dining outside with street festival was a bonus! Will come back from LA!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Definitely worth the hype!  I'm sometimes skeptical of \"tourist\" rated landmark food, but there's a reason this place gets so much attention, and they've earned it!

We got the platter that had a steak, corned beef, sausage to share, and also split a poutine... this was one of the best meals we ate all week!  The meat was like melt in your mouth and just incredible, it tastes like traditional home cooking.   The staff was so friendly too!  We sat at the bar and got to talk to a few of the guys behind the counter and they were just beyond friendly!  I'd absolutely go back in a heartbeat for lunch!"}
{"text":"If you're here it's a must that you try this place!!! The smoked meat platter was about 15 US dollars and it was well worth the money. It took me dinner and lunch to fish this plate. 

I don't review service because I'm here for the food in another country and service is last on my list."}
{"text":"I must admit, my memory is going to be a bit hazy. I entered Schwartz a bit drunk around 11 pm, brightly lit with fluorescent lights, my friend and I stumbling in just looking for some amazing smoked meat. Now, Schwartz was effectively pumped up to as much as it could be. My friend's parents ranted and raved, and they're foodies that are friends of the famous Normand Laprise. Christ, I expect the smoked meat to taste like it was carved by God himself. I sat down, at what could only be described as a Waffle House-esque bar, with a bunch of raucous Quebecois night shift workers behind the counter ready to carve me up some meat. I took one bite and... damn. I lost it. It's different from New York pastrami, it's not quite the same. It has a different flavor, not as much strong vinegar, with a distinct smokey flavor, rubbed in pepper and carefully loved until the meat is divine. There's nothing else to the sandwich: two slices of bread, a vegan's nightmare serving of meat, and some mustard. I ordered the sandwich, with (perhaps now I look at it) shamefully, a water and a pickle. Now, I love my dill pickles with my sandwiches, but nothing complimented the intricate flavors of a carefully smoked meat than this homemade dill pickles. If you are not a pickle person, stay away, but if you can appreciate a good deli pickle, get it. All in all, I'll describe it to you. The meat, tender and moist, melted and fell apart like Britney Spears when she shaved her head. It was as good as I imagined it to be. The sandwich itself was just so juicy and delicious I'm sitting in my dingy Atlanta apartment pondering if I have enough money to fly back. 

It's famous for a reason, tourists. It's not like the Hard Rock Café. You're not going to get that commercialized bullshit, this is real food. This is what you should go do if you're a serious foodie tourist. Avoid the familiar, stray away from the commercialized, step into this place and you'll understand what real traveling is about. The atmosphere was as unique, a collection of people Quebecois, Canadian and tourist alike, all seeking one thing; a damn fine sandwich. This place will deliver."}
{"text":"This placed is really hyped up and was a very big disappointment   I came here because a few friends said I needed to try this place, and a lot of yelp reviews raved about how great this place is.  Really?  There was nothing great about the food nor the service. 

The experience.  I got here around 11:30pm and this place still had a line, but it was a pretty small line and the wait about 5 minutes.  We were on the take out line, because we wanted to just eat and go.  I came here with my wife and her 2 cousins from Montreal.  One cousin said that Schwartz deli tasted like school cafeteria lunch at best.  I was skeptical and didn't think it could be that bad.  I asked if my sandwich could be cut into 4s rather than 2s.  The person said he didn't have time for that because there's a line.  What line?? There was only one person behind me.  I thought that him cutting one additional time wasn't too much to ask for.  Ordering, paying, and picking up the food was very confusing.  Also this place is cash only.

The food.  So putting the above issues aside, I thought maybe the quality of the food would make up for the poor service.  We unwrapped the pastrami sandwich and it smelled gamey, and it actually tasted gamey. Strike one.  We asked for no mustard, because my wife and I don't like mustard.  Guess what?? There's mustard smeared generously inside the sandwich. Strike two.  

As mentioned above, confusing process in ordering, paying and picking up food, along with poor attitude from the staff in just cutting the sandwich one additional time, strike three and you're outta here.  I will never come here again nor recommend this place.  Even if there was no line and they were giving these sandwiches out for free.  Stay clear because this place was a big waste of time.

Just a note, I've been on cruises and Katz deli in New York City several times, so I think I know how pastrami is supposed to taste.  Schwartz deli falls short in all ways possible in taste and service."}
{"text":"Original smoke meat gangsters. The infamous sandwich isn't the reason why you line up. It's the sum of many parts: the meat, the surly men behind the counter and the magic of the place. You can't re-create this spirit. You earn it over generations. It doesn't matter that their smoked meat isn't the best in the city. You can't get this feeling anywhere else."}
{"text":"Booya! If the words 'fatty smoked meat sandwich' don't scare you, then let Schwartz's hold the key to your heart. Located on the Main (St. Laurent Boulevard), this legendary deli offers up the best salty sammy in the city. Served with the house mustard, I order mine with a side of pickle. Trust me, you'll need the tart flavor to cut through that juicy fat! It's a messy and extremely unhealthy eat that I doubt my arteries could stand too often, but once a month? Sure, twist my rubber arm why don't you..."}
{"text":"Of course that's the best smoked meat in Montreal but probably the worst service also.
Ok this is just a Deli but come on... There's a minimum...
If you are a fan of Smoked Meat, let's have a look to Ruben's also.
Even if Schwartz's is and will stay my favorite smoked meat restaurant for the quality of the meat."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Like most other reviewers, heard about Montreal's famous smoked meat sandwiches. Huge portions, reasonably priced, friendly staff. Just a great place to try out whenever visiting Montreal. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I had tried this place about 3 years ago and loved it. I recently took a detour of 2hours to Montreal during a road trip just to have their sandwich again. The taste was still there but compared to last time the price had gone up while the portion size had got smaller. I would still go back but probably would not go out of my way for it. Also their customer service could improve. The cashier wasn't happy with our 10% tip and asked for more."}
{"text":"As a tourist in Montreal, I had to come try the smoked meat from Schwartz. There was a long line out of the door. My family and I waited for maybe about 15-20 minutes. There were only 4 of us so we ended up seating communally with 2 other people..so be prepared for that if you're a small group. 

The service is quite fast. They definitely want to get you in and out considering their long lines. 

I ordered a medium - between lean and fatty. Honestly, it was just okay for me. I was expecting to be wowed especially because of all the hype. The meat was almost dry and not quite juicy. I might've been served much leaner meat than I cared for. I actually had better smoked meat from the previous day from a random restaurant in Old Montréal. Overall 3.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years and I still have dreams of the smoked meat sammich. It's UNBELIEVABLY good.  In fact, I came thisclose to flying to Montreal over Labor Day weekend for the sole purpose of having a sammich and bringing home a suitcase full of meat -- no lie (only reason I didn't was 'cause I ended up visiting friends in Savannah).

You order at a counter and the guy who carves your sammich asks you how fatty you want it -- basically you can get it lean, regular of fatty.  Afficianados will tell you that fat = flavor and, of course, they are right.

Best paired with a black cherry soda and a pickle.

Gooood stuff."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is the original and still the best smoked meat place, at least that I've tried. However, the Main across the street is almost as good, a bit cheaper, and has a better selection. No lineup to get in, either.

That's not meant to be too much of a dig at Schwartz's, which has always narrowly avoided being a real tourist trap. They could go the Katz's (NYC) route and charge $15 for a basic sandwich. But they don't, which is not to be underestimated.

I'd suggest getting it for takeout (the door on the left)--the line is shorter, there are still a few tables in that part of the restaurant, and the service on the right side (where the lineups are), while fine, isn't anything special enough to be worth the extra wait."}
{"text":"Yes, it's touristy but it did not disappoint. We visited Schwartz's on a recent trip to Montreal and are still dreaming about the simple yet DELICIOUS smoked meat sandwich. We got very lucky with the timing on a Sunday afternoon and arrived when there was virtually no line. We were quickly served with a sandwich and fries both of which were very yummy. It looked like there was seating outside, but it was pretty warm and we were able to snag bar seats in the back with the A/C. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"What can I say. It lived up to the hype. I bought two sandwiches: One for the restaurant, and one for the plane ride home. Best decision i've ever made."}
{"text":"Damn yummy!!! Worth the walk from the metro station. I got the combo with smoked meat, steak and fries for $17. It was great. Fast service."}
{"text":"Unbelievable delicious and good deals. The smell of smoked meat is so great and I ordered a smoked meat sandwich and salad. If the meat come with some meat juices that will be fantastic."}
{"text":"Lives up to the reputation.  It's a dive with great smoked beef.  The line outside is always there and thy keep it moving.  Cole slaw is original, excellent and no mayo in sight.  Friendly, prompt service."}
{"text":"I went to the takeout place. The wait wasn't nearly as bad as the main restaurant. I got the classic smoked meat sandwich, the fries and an airtight sealed package of smoked meat to bring back home to Toronto. It all came up to 35 dollars (god the 15% tax hurts here). The meat was incredible. In the sandwich as a whole though, I wish there was some more mustard to complement the rich meat flavour. The fries were all right, nothing really special. All in all, it's worth it to experience it once, but for the price I don't think I would return too often."}
{"text":"Schwartz is the king of Montreal Smoked Meat. 

If you can only hit one Smoked Meat shop then pick Schwartz."}
{"text":"We got a seat at the bar right away. The staff was friendly and the food was FAST! We ordered a medium-fat, 1 plate of fries and a cherry coke, as recommended by our local friend. We were not disappointed. Even as a woman, I was able to eat my whole sandwich, but I had to take about 1/2 the meat off. Lucky for me, my husband eats anything I don't so nothing goes to waste.
This was phenomenal and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Why so tasty? Me and my boyfriend ordered the medium fat smoked meat sandwich, with coleslaw and pickles. I gotta say it's the best Montreal meat sandwich I've ever had. Just as I predicted. 

P.s, This place is cash only with an ATM inside.
Also do expect to wait for at least 20 mins to get in."}
{"text":"Great food! A must visit for all who come too Montreal. Not the most visually appearing of places but don't judge this little gem upon that alone!"}
{"text":"A certain person insisted we come here despite the touristyness and the fact that, living in NY, I feel we can have all manner of great Jewish deli meat anytime.  

I hate to admit it, but Schwartz's very-hyped smoked meat* sandwich was delicious. Juicy and never tough, just the right amount of fat speckled with beautiful cracked peppercorns... $6 is actually mighty reasonable for this sandwich, compact but mounded like a pyramid. This was definitely a tourist destination that DELIVERED. (not literally)

*FYI: \"Smoked meat\" is simply Montrealers' term for pastrami, but there was nothing pastrami-like about it. It was corned beef through and through! Which is a good thing since I looooove corned beef and usually find pastrami just a bit too salty/dry. (Pastrami is corned beef that has been smoked.)

Just a few notes on the touristyness: We waddled into the restaurant shortly past noon. Every single one of the tightly packed tables was full. A waiter was cycling through languages at his table: \"English? Francais? Espanol?\" We were told that to order to-go, you go to the shop next door. I couldn't wait to get out of there.

The shop next door is MUCH quieter, AND it has seating! Why were people in the restaurant at all??? We got our food in under a minute, ate it in peace in the mostly-empty sunny windowed cafe space toward the back, and even had the leisure to gaze at their prepared food items - meat, slaw, souvenir-y items...

When we left, there appeared to be a tour bus lineup outside the restaurant space's door. 30 people stomping in the cold. Why?? Is table service integral to the sandwich experience? Maybe I missed out? My stomach doesn't think so...

I believe their card minimum is $10."}
{"text":"Great service! Love the hole in the wall environment. To me places like this usually have the best food and actually enhances the flavor. My friend and I shared a small plate of the dried meat. I'm not a meat person but this stuff was great. Juicy and tender. Yum!"}
{"text":"Omg. The best smoked meat sandwiches ever. This was my first meal AND last meal in Montreal. The first time, the take out next door was closed so we just asked for take out from the restaurant instead. They did have plenty of available tables but we just wanted to enjoy these delicious sandwiches in the confines of our hotel. I did expect the sandwiches to be like a foot high like the ones from Katz, but this was more on the smaller side. Although, it is a lot cheaper than Katz. Definitely ask for medium or else they give you lean meat. The brisket was tender and flavorful. We also tried the fries and they gave us packets of vinegar and ketchup. I never had fries with vinegar before but it did go well. They were crispy and fresh just like the ones from Pomme Frites in NYC. I do regret not trying their poutine though. 

On the second visit, we experienced a HUGE line for the restaurant as well as the take out next door. Guess it really depends on what time you go. Bring cash or else they charge a 10% extra when paying with American Dollars!"}
{"text":"This place was both delicious and adorable. We certainly didn't mind sitting inches away from other diners (sharing a table is the norm here). Food arrives FAST. We ordered and shared the smoked meat sandwich. For some reason in my head I was expecting it to arrive hot - not the case! Basic rye bread and mustard - that's all you need as the meat is puked up high! Really tasty meat and pleasant dining experience. We went around 6/630 on a Saturday and there was no line."}
{"text":"This place hands down has excellent smoked meat. It definitely is a Montreal landmark. My boyfriend is from out of town and loves coming here. We prefer to order our smoked meat a bit on the fatty side - it is much more flavourful this way, I strongly recommend it! Their pickles and their coleslaw are delicious too. The drag with this place is the long lines. Tourists: the inside is kind of run down and they sit you next to other strangers - you are better off at their take out store which is right next door! In their take out area, they have a few places that you can sit and eat. Otherwise, what we do is, we will take it to go, and sit across the street at the area where the city has designated a rest area with benches. There are also many nearby parks to enjoy your food and avoid the crazy lines.

A downfall in my opinion is that the restaurant is Cash only, so irritating when you are forced to use the ATM."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place having the best smoked meat in town and the long lines out the door in the bitter cold led me to believe that it was true.  I can tell you that wasn't my experience at all . I thought the meat was ok flavor-wise, but it was exceptionally dry and the sandwiches were quite small for the price of almost $9. Final verdict is go for the service and atmosphere but I think you get much better smoked meat at Reuben's."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich.  Get it.  Meat not as piled high as Katz Deli but it also costs $9 which is cheaper than Katz.  Meat is so tender and good amount of fatty pieces.  On rye bread with mustard, it just tastes good.  There is a takeout place right next door to the restaurant which had a line of 15 people.  The takeout place had like 10 chairs in the back which was perfect to try this sandwich."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal and this place was on my top list. I got here around lunch time on a weekday and there was a line outside of the restaurant. The line moved pretty quickly and waited about 20 minutes for party of 4. We all got the famous smoked meat plus fries and pickles on the side (all their sides are extra). The food came out in about ten minutes. Honestly, it did not live up to hype. The smoked meat taste bit too dry for me."}
{"text":"Always good to have a schwartz smoked meat,  i like to go there every once in a while. The smoke meat has that special something that makes it better than any other you can find in the city.
Recently prices went up, we can now say that it went from cheap to reasonable. I always order my sandwich medium-lean not too dry not to fatty...and always get a fry , coleslaw and a pickle.
They also sell by the pound for take out, great idea for a friends/family dinner at home,  but dont forget to get a bag of bread and the Schwartz mustard.
For those who never tried it,  its a must."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Montreal! The menu is very simple and straight forward. The smoked meat is amazing. Have it on it's own or as a sandwich, regardless you will be in heaven with every bite you take. The meat is so tender and falls apart. Have it with Fries, Pickles or the Peppers."}
{"text":"If you're visiting Montreal, a meat eater, this is one of those places you must visit: Schwartz's for their smoked meat.  From the outside, there are two lines formed, the line on the left of the entrance is for dine in, the line right of the entrance is for take away.  Everyone in your group must already all present to get seated, which will involve sharing a table unless your group is six which is a full table.  The portions are huge.  Sunday-Thursday 8am-12:30am, Friday 8am-1:30am, Saturday 8am-2:30am, hot meat available after 10am."}
{"text":"Luckily we only had to experience a 10 min wait on a grand prix weekend!  Could only come up with that it was so nice out no one wanted to be inside, which I was very appreciative for.  To be honest i like to call them suckas!

They accompanied a party of 6 with no hassles or sighs!  Staff was super friendly n helpful for us non locals.  

Food is basically a review on the MEAT!  The smoked meat, which i feel needs to be ordered \"medium\".  It provides the perfect amount of fat, moisturizing and flavoring the meat perfectly!   Killed my first Sammy, I had to get a 2nd one. Basically had to look like I was prego for 12 hours but it was 126.83% worth it. 

Besides that the fries were good n my friends said the pickles were outstanding.  Im not a fan of them but if i do make any recommendations from what women say they do like my pickle!  ;-)"}
{"text":"Skipped the line and went to their take out deli next door, which is far less crowded, has the smoke meat sandwich i wanted and has seating for around a dozen or so.

Got the smoked meat sandwich and a side of cole slaw.  My first reaction is \"I made a mistake.\". The 4 people in front of me all ordered the smoked meat by the pound and a loaf of bread for take away and I was the poor schmuck who went with the actual sandwich.  However, being a solo diner looking to follow up this fatty meal with a slow hike up Mt Royal, I think I made the right choice.  However, if its a nice day don't be afraid to have a picnic.

The smoked meat is what I expected, a nice greasy helping of corned beef with some mustard (kind of a cross between yellow and golden...I'm assuming it's proprietary mustard) on soggy bread.  My fat body told my brain that this was smaller than what I was used to, but my brain pointed out I don't need a tower of corned beef and when adjusted for FX, it is likely close to what you get in the states as a pricing point. 

At first I wasn't impressed.  I don't know, I guess I saw the HUGE line for the dining room and all the reviews and I just did not think it held water to the American delis.  However, by the second half of the sandwich the flavor started to hit my tongue.  It's moist and flavorful without being overwhelming.  The Cole slaw was tasty too.  Sweet, but not too creamy.

Bottom line is that I left thinking i miss Attmans of Baltimore and Hymies of the Mainline.  However, this is a solid choice and I may make a stop to the dining room before my trip is over."}
{"text":"Leaning toward 3.5 stars, actually. Boy are they gruff here, from the cashier to the behind-the-bar guys. We were startled to find out what we thought was one sandwich nicely split in two for two of us to share was actually two sandwiches period. Small ones at that, with no pickle, for $7.35. Ouch. The bread is nothing special, and there are no extras inside such as lettuce or sauerkraut. Just meat - and thank goodness the meat was excellent. So juicy, with just enough fat."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot before arriving to this restaurant. The established smoked meat sandwiches since 1928 were too hard to resist not visiting during my trip to Montreal. When me and my family arrived, we were greeted with a long lineup of people. After waiting several minutes and watching an unemployed guy beg for money, we got a table sharing with two friendly elderly people. 

Me and my family all ordered the smoked meat sandwich dressed with mustard and pickles on the side. After they arrived, we all started digging in. The smoked meat was amazing. However, more smoked flavor would have made the dish perfect. The pickles were a nice side and served well with the sandwich (ordered separately). The service was quick and fast but also helpful. 

Schwartz exceeded some of my expectations. The smoke meat was great but I was expecting more with the smoked flavor. Also, the check (or bill) was very expensive, costing $46 for four people. I recommend this for people trying smoked meat for the first time. I will definitely return to Schwartz's."}
{"text":"I checked in here a couple of months ago and totally forgot to review this restaurant.  

Then I saw the pictures of the food here, and I started salivating again.

All I remember was... oh my... this is good.  The flavors, the atmosphere.  It's a cash only, no frills sort of place.  Seating is tight, be friendly as you are likely going to share a table with someone else.  The sodas are out of the can, but the food... and the slaw, the pickles, fries.... And the service.. they've been there for years.  They love what they do. 

Next time I'm in Montreal, I'm heading back here.  There's some lovely and fancy restaurants, but this place was special."}
{"text":"how can you come to montreal and not be greeted with the love for smoked meat?  smoked meat on poutine, smoked meat sandwiches...all for good reason!

after many people recommended schwartz's, i did a little happy dance when i found out our hotel (hotel 10) was only a 10 minute walk away! gathered my friends and onwards we made the walk to schwartz's.

we were expecting to split a sandwich between 4 of us because we were thinking it would be the size of american sandwiches however, the portion sizes are perfect for 1 individual. we were a bit deterred after seeing the long line of people waiting to be seated but while walking with our heads hung low, we saw a little door for \"take out\" service. i did another happy dance when i saw there was a small seating section in the back! whoo hoo!

we were at schwartz's around 7pm and line was long but we must have hit the take out counter before it got super busy!  we split 2 smoked meat sandwiches and got 2 pickles. they do take card so don't worry if you don't have cash on hand.

a lot of people compare this to pastrami (and katz and carnegie deli in nyc) BUT i don't think you could really compare as the smoked meat was a much more tame taste.  not too salty and not slathered with mustard. the sandwich was actually quite the perfect size and pickles were just the amount of crunch and sourness. 

if you have time to wait, for it; for us, we dislike waiting so the take out option was great for us!"}
{"text":"Let's be real: I don't need to write a long review. There is little to say except it's a required visit on your visit to Montreal. I've heard rumors of better places to get your viande fumee, but that doesn't matter: I went to this one, and it was fantastic. Delightfully marbled beef, tender, juicy. Yes, please. Fresh, fresh bread. The right amount of heat in the mustard. Yes.

Hey, they have other things too! The salami is excellent (but served cold, fair warning). And yes, I do love pickles, and theirs are somehow even better than most, with just a hint of garlic. The frites, though, are meh. 

Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I be a regular? Probably not. Go to St. Viateur instead--their viande fumée is just as good, AND you get delicious, delicious bagels (and no line)."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. We arrived right at noon on a Thursday and to my surprise - no line up! That is always the best, and there was meat! However, a few minutes later a line started forming so this happened to have been just luck or we just had amazing timing! 

Of course, order the smoke meat sandwich as that's what they're known for. The waiter is going to ask if you want mustard on the side - that's up to you. I would recommend it, or you can ask for it on the side. They give you LOTS of meat so totally worth the money. I finished mines. 

For those who do not fancy smoke meat, you can always order the chicken or turkey sandwich. The waiter will tell you they are just cold cuts. Not a big deal though but you still get lots of meat. Pricing was very reasonable for the amount of meat."}
{"text":"If you haven't heard of Schwartz, you haven't been asking around.  This is the top place people told me to visit.  My friend who went to college in Montreal raved about it.  

They call it \"smoked meat\".  Its comparable to a corned beef or pastrami like Langers in Los Angeles (not at all like the Hat, etc.)  

Its served straight up, tons of slices of meat between rye with a spread of mustard.  And thats really it.  No frills.  Just a lot of meat, smoked and cured and resmoked again.  Its ridiculous how much meat they have in their smoker as I sat at the counter and saw them take it out of the smoker and stack em and put it back in, in reverse order i assume, just to get it even maybe.  

The \"cole slaw\" was unlike I've had before. It was most like dilled cabbage, not like the typical mayonaise slaw.  Goes nicely with the meal, I recommend it over a side of fries for sure.  

Its a little much to charge almost $2 for a pickle tho.  Its a hearty pickle, and I love pickles, but I dunno.  Just doesnt seem right.

For an institution over 80's years, this place is a must see.  I'm even thinking of going back before I leave..."}
{"text":"It's nice when tourist hot spots live up to the hype, and Schwartz's does. They serve giant, fatty sandwiches with delicious smoked meat and very good homemade fries and pickles. It's cheap by Montreal standards, and it's in a fine location. The smoked meat sandwich is so big that you can clearly taste the difference between different parts of the cut of meat, and when I bit into a perfectly marbled chunk I got a pleasure response through my whole body. It's not the best deli I've ever been to, but it was much better than the other smoked meat I had in Montreal. Since this does seem to have a big tourist crowd, I suggest to fellow tourists that you just go to the take-out side and bring your sandwich a few block to the edge of Mont Royal Park. The line for table service is way too long, and if you're visiting Montreal, it's likely that you're going during the few months of warm weather, so skip the wait and eat outside."}
{"text":"Oh Schwartz's! 
It was hard to decide whether or not to go to because of all of the mixed reviews. Some people said that it was too touristy but I think it was perfect. There was no shitkit and it was a very straightforward dining experience. The servers weren't particularly nice but they don't have to be... This place is an institution! The smoked meat sandwich was perfect! We also arrived at the perfect time we didn't have to wait for a seat but the people behind us did. Also be warned that they have community seating! I will say as a Montreal first timer make sure to stop in."}
{"text":"I live in Toronto and I go to Montreal at least 6 times a year and each time we go our first stop is here for best smoked meat great steak and of corse a black cherry soda this review made me hungry Iam thinking ROAD TRIP!"}
{"text":"This place is small and historic. The smoked meat, the fries, the giant pickle, delicious. But the liver is not so great, it was a random pick by my boyfriend and it was very dry. The lineups are really long but some people are willing to wait even in the dreadful Montreal winter days."}
{"text":"I did a take out. The old man taking my order and the lady at the counter just had a little attitude for some reason. 
I ordered the meat sandwich. It was good but left me thirsty all night."}
{"text":"Food was good, and apparently this is consistent for who knows how long? They're quick and efficient, with Mike telling us what people normally get (which helps, as we were tourists visiting on our honeymoon).

Long story short, Mike made it a very memorable meal during our honeymoon, and everyone working there was incredibly friendly despite being in a stressful situation. And the food is definitely worth trying, Simple and delicious."}
{"text":"My family grew up in Montreal, so I imagine I've been to Schwartz's way back in the day.  Before I was an adult.

I found myself in Montreal on Thanksgiving (the American one) and figured what better way to celebrate then to get a smoked meat sandwich.  Arrived at around 8pm and grabbed a seat at the bar.  The guy working took my order and suggested a black cherry soda.  I told him no thanks, but he wasn't paying attention and promptly brought me one and poured it for me.  There goes your tip, man.

Sandwich was pretty good, and reasonably priced at $6.65.  (The unrequested soda was $2.10.) I'm not a huge smoked meat fan, but this is probably the best smoked meat sandwich I've had.  And this place is legendary, so how can you hate it?

What's that?  Celene Dion is a part owner?  Fuck."}
{"text":"On my last day of being in Montreal trying the reuben sandwich, I had to try the famous Smoked Meat Sandwich. Everyone who knew about smoked meat advised me to go to Schwartz's. I did not know where it was located so I went on the hunt for this famous place. I asked around for directions and all of the Montreal people stated \"its just down that street make a left.\" So after following these directions to Schwartz's, I finally arrived there 1 hour later. With that long and dreadful walk my appetite was at an all time high. Unfortunately I forgot that a couple of people mentioned that there is always a lineup. I would estimate that there were 23 people were in line. Being hungry and impatient we decided we would go into the other shop dedicated to takeout orders. Even going in there there was a line up of about a dozen people. 

So I decided in line that I would just go for the Medium Smoked Meat Sandwich, with a pickle, and a Cherry Cola. After all the wait I sat down with my sandwich and began endulging. The bread was a nice thin slice filled with a fat stack of tender smoked meat and mustard. Im not a big fan of mustard but in this sandwich it was perfect. It was 6-7 dollars for a decent size but excellent quality sandwich. I washed it down with the delicious cherry cola and was satisfied. I would have got another one if I didnt have to wait in line. I would definitely recommend this place if you come to Montreal. I would just suggest that you know where you are going before you go on a mile long walk. Overall a simple sandwich with an incredible taste."}
{"text":"Three words: Incredible smoked meat.

I know my brisket. I lived in Texas for three years, and there's amazing brisket there as well - albeit prepared in a very different way. The end result is the same: incredibly tender, juicy, flavorful beef. That is what you get here.

This is a must stop, especially if you are a tourist in Montreal.

Tip: Get the fatty. Because it's more tender, more juicy, more flavorful, and you only live once."}
{"text":"Honestly, I didn't see what the fuss was about. My smoked meat was dry and very chewy. I loved the old decor and atmosphere, but with the long waits in the small, crammed restaurant, I could easily find another decent smoked meat place in Montreal. Maybe I just got unlucky with my order, but I don't feel compelled to go back for the aforementioned reasons. In my opinion, it's on its way to being a tourist trap."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, this place is SO MUCH better than freakin Katz' in NY. The place is way smaller but it has the same old school feel to it. We went around 6ish and it was packed. The tables were all full and there was a small line of people waiting to order take out. We got one smoked meat sandwich and a soda at the counter and ate it outside. SO GOOD. I'm totally not a pastrami/curedmeats/cornedbeef type of girl but this was juicy and flavorful. The bread was soft and there was just the right amount of mustard to make me dance in place."}
{"text":"Great old deli place that's got simple tables and seats and a tiny menu. But they make a damn good smoked meat sandwich. Flavorful and warm the meat is way better than what you get in New York delis like Katz. You also don't feel pressure and the staff who has been there for a while know they have a good product so they don't sweat the small stuff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"In town for the day. Must get to Schwartzs before I fly back. Need smoked meat sammich and a few bottles of spice. The best. Even my vegetarian wife loves it. Fries and pickles rock."}
{"text":"Don't hate me but I feel like the quality has dropped over the years. What used to be a warm Montreal deli has turned into cold one. 

When I remember going to Schwartz's I remember warm meat, Spicy mustard and fresh bread. 

Somehow, my expectations were not met. 

I was served a cold meat sandwich, regular mustard and a complete lack of standards. 

I'm heartbroken - this business that was at the top of the game about a decade ago and I sense it's is going to fail. 

Hence the increased prices, lower quality products and overall crappy service. 

I'm so sorry to say this but I'm sad. Super sad that this institution is going to die. 

Lower the prices, rely on less tourists, improve the quality of food served - and voila - you've got a viable business model again."}
{"text":"They aren't still lining up down the block here for nothing. The smoked meat sandwich here is still the delicious reason to show up, even if it seems to have gotten a bit smaller over time.

If you plan to eat here (and haven't before), arrive early or come at an odd time like mid-afternoon when you can be seated. Even if you come at a crowded time, things move quickly. You will share a table with strangers regardless.

Note that they have a take out store two doors down that has some seating in the back. They start serving sandwiches at 11. If you just want the sandwich, or if you want to pick up some to go, this is a great option. They have packaged meat, as well as mustards, seasoning, slaw, etc."}
{"text":"No. Terrible. I dont care that it is a Montreal landmark..paying to get nasty comebacks to any remarks. Cold bread, soggy fries and dry smoked meat(i specifically asked it not be lean) ...the Main x a billion. Or even any local dive deli in Montreal beats this place. 

Dudes..the soup Nazi bit is old. Really old."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Fatty smoked meat, mustard on rye with pickle. Yum. Meat melts in your mouth. Bought it home to PA and it reheated (steam) amazingly well. So delicious as my mouth waters!"}
{"text":"mmMmMmmm... I sometimes dream about the smoked meat sandwich here. 

that reminds me... i should really go visit soon."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat! A montreal classic. A symbol of the city.
 I love pastrami and brisket but this is even better. I agree with the yelpers it is better than Katz's in NYC though it is different.

It is old fashion sandwich with flavor and smokiness.
It is cheap and you have to fight in lines and lines so go in summer time or spring or you will turn into icicles."}
{"text":"Best Montreal style smoke meat in town ..  the smoke meat poutine is to die for .   Located in a nice downtown setting ."}
{"text":"The smoked meat here is my little slice of heaven I cannot help going back to! I also tried the steak but it was too salty for my taste.
Somehow, sitting at the counter makes the food taste even more heavenly."}
{"text":"The line for dining in was too long so did the take-out. The smoked meat and brisket was great. Ordered enough to make multiple sandwiches. Great food."}
{"text":"Its Schwartz's , so get ready. Small divey place.. no elbow room, but finger licking good on their smoked meat. Order a plate.. you will get a plate of meat and bread on the side. The fries are popular, but I thought they were just OK."}
{"text":"Schwartz's c'est bon... mais sa popularité est due à la notoriété de la place. Pour ma part, je trouve ça un peu trop cher, les files d'attentes un peu trop longues, mais je m'y retrouve quand même une fois de temps en temps quand c'est d'adon."}
{"text":"Sandwhich, fries, a pickle to share and a black cherry cola. That's all you need to say!

The best stuff in the city. If you are from out of town (and more-so if from NY City) - don't call our smoked meat pastrami! You'll end up with an earfull from the person next to you, or your waiter."}
{"text":"Hmmm. I might need to give this place another try. The sandwich that was given to me was not even warm. I think this definitely changed the texture and quality of the smoked meat that I ate. It was dry and not that flavorful. The amount of meat was adequate for the price and I would've loved to eat more if I had more stomach space!

This is a small shop and I was confused of how to order. Just wait for them to let you know you can sit down and they have waiters around that will take your order. They serve it pretty quickly afterwards because the smoked meat is already done. They just toast some bread and slather some mustard on it then bring it to you.

I enjoyed the Cole slaw. It was perfectly seasoned and complemented well with the smoked meat."}
{"text":"HONESTLY this place is nothing crazy. Literally just smoked meat and bread....I didn't want to try since I knew this place was probably overhyped but I felt like leaving Montreal without trying Schwartz's would be equivalent to me going to Boston and not trying their clam chowder. If you are visiting Montreal yes you should definitely come here but do know you are just joining the hype movement."}
{"text":"During my stay in Montreal I decided to try the authentic smoked meat sandwiches and this place had one of the best sandwiches I have tried. The meat is tender and flavourful; ideal for lunch but you might have to order 2 sandwiches because they're kind of small. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about smoked meats from Schwartz's, and I can't say that I was completely impressed with my meal. The meat sandwich was on the dry side, and it was pricey for its portion. The venue was packed, so my friend and I were forced to squeeze into the back by the kitchen door."}
{"text":"Hot Damn! That's a good sandwich. The smoked meat sandwich was all my hopes and dreams between two pieces of rye bread. The meat was flavorful, juicy and just all around delicious. We also ordered the poutine and it was pretty tasty too! If you go be prepared to wait, we got in fairly quickly but noticed a line forming not too soon after. The place is kind of small so you may sit with strangers. Also it's cash only. Run! Don't walk!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, it's overrated
Smoked meat does not have much favour. 
Meat is try even with fatty option."}
{"text":"The best smoked meat world wide. Excellent french fries and very good pickles. A Montreal institution and a must stop. Possibly one of the 7 wonders of the food world..."}
{"text":"Made of mothercuffing win.  As I am a NY jew, I am always dubious that anything can possibly be better than jewish delicacies in NY.  Well, this just might be.  The smoked meat is not salty and not too smoky... a little fatty, but isn't that the point?  The texture is like... butter.  The best comparable I can think of is Texas BBQ.  I don't know how they do it, but it is unreal and totally worth the wait in line and the crowds and the gruff service.  OMFG.  Oh yeah, and a huge sandwich is $5.50.  Whaaat?"}
{"text":"My friend said it was great.   I would rather go to Katz's and get a real sandwich with the same ambience... save some gas....and lose the attitude...FATFATFAT...Soggy bread....long lines..."}
{"text":"No words can convey the feeling of eating a  number 4 at Schwartz's. It's better then you first sexual encounter, it's that good! If you're ever in Montreal stop in even if the line looks long, just do it!"}
{"text":"Visited Schwartz's over the Thanksgiving long weekend. According to google and yelp, this was the best place to devour Montreal Smoked Meat. Indeed, this was absolutely true. Their smoked meat was heavenly. 

We arrived a little after 10am on Thanksgiving day. Walked in and was seated immediately by a man behind the counter. After we sat down, the only waiter in the entire restaurant came by and wanted to take our orders. I asked if I could get a menu because I'm not aware or sure of how to order and exactly what to order. The man rudely said and I quote \"there is no menu, we only have smoked meat and we're very well known for that\" and he proceeds to point to their wall covered in newspaper clippings of their restaurant. 

We were already turned off by the rude comment. But we insisted on having smoked meat for brunch. We settled for two Montreal smoked meat sandwiches. These sandwiches were gigantic and beautiful. They are what heaven is made of, i'm sure of it. Fresh bread spread with mustard and filled with so much Montreal Smoked Meat that you totally forget about the bad service. Each bite reminded me that I was closer and closer to finishing my sandwich and that i should probably pace myself. But it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD. Before you knew it, i gobbled up my sandwich in about 10 minutes. 

Would I be back at Schwartz's? Probably not. I'm sure there are other places that have Smoked Meat at par. To me, customer service is very vital. I'm all about the food, but good customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"In New York we call this corned beef. It was actually really good, most and flavorful, everyone is friendly too! I will be back."}
{"text":"A bit underwhelming to be totally honest.

The smoked meat sandwich was tasty, but I didn't feel it was worth the wait nor the price. Enjoyed the friendly service, although it would be nice to not have to share tables!

Really, it's just one of those places that you have to go in Montreal regardless, so I went. Would I come here regularly if I were living in Montreal? Probably not. Would I go again if I were visiting again? That would be a yes.

I would not recommend the poutine, as it was average at best."}
{"text":"There's a tiny section of Montreal that made me feel like I was in the LES of Manhattan. It's filled with classic delis that serve those iconic piled high sammies you need at least two sittings to finish. Apparently this is THE must stop for smoked meats and classic Jewish fare in the area. 

We arrived early in the morning and there was the start of a line. If you come before 10am they will not sell you hot meat and that was somewhat of a bummer for hubs as he was really looking forward to a Rueben not just a cold corned beef on not toasted rye. It was huge and priced appropriately for size. He said it was pretty good, not outstanding. I honestly think he was just disappointed that he wasn't able to get what he was really looking for. 

We also bought one of each of their mustards to bring home to family and house rub. All were absolutely incredible as was the single large kosher dill I couldn't resist. Definitely grab some bottles to go!!! When these are done, I'm calling to figure out how to get more. They're insanely delicious! Best mustard ever! 

I say give it a go but get there right at 10am to avoid long lines and if you want a hot sandwich. 

Unmetered street parking was easy to find earlier in the morning, but I can see it may become and issue later in the day."}
{"text":"Good smoked meat. The sandwich was smaller than I expected at 10$ a piece but a good portion for one person or two if you're feeling snacky. The meat itself is very good. Reminded me of katz deli in NY."}
{"text":"For people that havent been here before: you take a seat at any table (and tables are shared, so sit next to the wall if the table is empty). A waiter will come help you out and everything is paid in the front corner (including tips).

The waiter was helpful and the sandwiches were delicious. Normally I don't like smoked anything, but the meat doesn't have a strongly smoked flavour, and it was completely tender and soft! The cherry coke is a bit sweet, but the combination of cherry coke and smoked meat is awesome! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This a must go to when in Montreal!! They are open really and close late. Lunch hours are the busiest. My advise it to order Togo . And don't let long line discourage you . There are two lines one for takeout and dining in. Take out orders take a least 20-30 mins . Dining in take at least one hour during lunch time.

The Food.
 The smoked meat sandwich is the poploular item on the menu. They do have non carb items like the smoke plate items that contain double the meat than the sandwich.

  What I had and liked.
+Smoked meat sandwich $9.60 CAD  contain thick slices of warm smoked meat thin bread with mustard
+Large plate smoked meat $17.25 CAD  large slices of smoked meats with sliced bread

The verfict. 
Be side the limited seating and long line for tego and dineing in . There food and service has been consistent . Great Landmark must go when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place, I'm always satisfied !

Smoked meat sandwich is perfect ! The whole atmosphere is relax and chill. You can seat at the counter and get in little conversation with the cook. Or seat at a table with friends."}
{"text":"What else can be said, that hasn't been said already? There's a reason this place is so well-known and beloved (apparently there's even a musical named after it - who knew!). 

First, if you're driving. We found free parking on a small residential street behind the restaurant. But note that you can only park there during certain times, so read the signs! (i.e. parking between 11AM to 3:00 PM, etc).

Second, the visit. We came around 11:00 AM on a Friday, and there was no lineup! The place was certainly very busy but we were seated right away. We weren't too hungry and ordered just one smoked meat sandwich, fries, and 2 black cherry sodas, per many recommendations below. In short - amazing. I'm not normally a fan of deli meat but it was cooked to perfection. Soft, smoky, melt-in-your-mouth delicious, with a great kick of spicy mustard. The black cherry soda was the cherry on top! There's no question that I'll be back here when I'm visiting Montreal again.

This place might look like a total dive (think 80's diner), but it's clean, service is friendly and efficient, and the food makes for a simple yet unforgettable meal. For two people, with tax, and tip, we paid around $23.00."}
{"text":"Of course I love Schwartz's, I hate lines and so I rarely go here, but I love the people and I love the food and I love the place Jewish food, culture and families have in Montreal's history and contemporary life. I love to order party platters of smoked meat and rye from Schwartz's - this is a great way to have a delicious taste of Montreal at your events, highly recommended."}
{"text":"A classic restaurant in Montreal. I went there with relatives from abroad, as part of a sight-seeing tour of Montreal.

We ordered the classic must-have: Medium Smoked meat Sandwich, pickle and a black cherry soda. 
The meat was juicy and tender, definitely tasty. The pickle, however, was rather sour. Overall, the meal was decent, and definitely worth the trip if visiting Montreal.

The downside of Schwartz is that, being a tourist attraction, the prices are rather high for the amount of food provided. We went with 4 people in total, and the bill totaled nearly 80 dollars CAD."}
{"text":"On our last day of visiting this beautiful city, we decided to stop by this dainty little smoked meat place for breakfast. I heard this is the place the Montreal folks get their smoked meat and as it turns out, Canadian smoked meat blew me out of the water...and I've had the best in Texas.

I ordered a simple brisket sandwich (yes, they speak English) and sausages. The first bite of that moist and smokey meat had me prancing around like a little girl in the shop. It was juicy, tender, smokey, and taste like pure cow heaven. It was in fact, sooooo good, that I devoured it within seconds and was eager to order their sausages as well. The sausages was juicy, savory, crunchy on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside. 

If you are an hour away, you should go to this place. If you live two hours away, you should still go to this place. If you live in the US like me...well, you should buy several pound of these smoked goodies and devour it to your heart's content. It is soooooo good!"}
{"text":"I understand there's a lot of history here, but I was pretty disappointed. The line moves quickly enough, but it was still a 30 minute wait. Here's a secret...they have a to-go counter where you can skip the line, just go through the doors to the left of the main entrance. We opted for the full experience so we waited...once we were inside, we got packed in like sardines. The two of us shared a table with two other parties, which is theoretically fine if there was enough space to relax a bit but ultimately I felt like I couldn't even breathe. The sandwich itself wasn't good, the meat was dry :( We liked Ruben's downtown better.

On the brightside, I thought the staff was really friendly! I'm glad we tried it, but we'll be going to other places the next time we're in Montreal. I probably wouldn't recommend it at all to other people."}
{"text":"I went to Montreal a few weeks ago Schwartz was no doubt on the top of my list of eats. They did not disappoint! I heard there's usually a long line up for their sandwiches, but I think there were less people that day due to the rainy weather.  The servers in the restaurant were friendly and humorous.  The seating is a bit cramped, the décor is retro and you will most likely have to sit next to some strangers.  However, it's all worth it, the smoke meat sandwich was flavourful as expected, and the bread was very fresh.  It wouldn't be a place to go for a date, but it's fantastic for a quick bite when there's no line.  If you are visiting Montreal you should definitely make a stop here."}
{"text":"I know it's a Montreal institution and tourists flock here because the restaurant was in some famous movies years and years ago but I don't feel it's worth the wait. The lines are typically very large and then you get in and share a table with a group of strangers and get mediocre service at best. The food is god but there's better smoked meat at several other Montreal delis. It's a great option if you live in the area but I wouldn't take the trip to go back there with all the other options available."}
{"text":"We took the 55 bus to Schwartz's. Upon arriving we had no idea how Schwartz's ordering worked so we waited in line. After 15 minutes in line we realized that if you are taking sandwiches to go that you don't have to wait in the line outside. Just walk in and place your order. Soooo, after waiting for 15 minutes we figured we would wait for a table. 

While waiting for the table we smelled a terrible sewage/garbage smell coming from a alley area directly connected to Schwartz. This totally ruined our appetites but we still waited. After 25 minutes our party of 4 was seated. We ordered the 1lb smoked meat platter for about 15 bucks. It comes with meat and bread. 

The smoked meat has a good flavor to it. It is spiced differently than Katz Deli and I really don't believe you can compare the two. Schwartz smoked meat is different from pastrami. I will say that when I visit Montreal again I will probably skip Schwartz if there is a line.  It is good but not worth a 25 minute wait and I could find comparable or better meats here in NYC."}
{"text":"If you eat meat, this place is great. It's old-fangled and simple. Be prepared to wait for a while. The line moves reasonably quickly, but I've never seen it without a line out the door (make sure that you don't get in the wrong line. one is for take-out and one is for sit-down).  It's good to know what you are going to order before you sit down. They move fast inside! Cash only!

I'm vegetarian, but I will come here just for the decor, the ambiance, the chips and salade de chou. I usually hate cole slaw, but they have a very nice one here. Their chips taste very clean and fresh which is probably because they don't fry anything else in the oil. It is very different than a NY deli.

I think it will be very nice when they open up the take-out annex with another smoker. I hope it works out for them!"}
{"text":"The smoked meat makes Katz's look like lunchables"}
{"text":"5 star smoked meat! period!

I have been reading about Montreal smoked meat, but never seen a place until this trip. Lucky that place was Schwartz's a staple of Montreal smoked meat since 1928!

It is deli similar to katz's in NYC (smaller) except instead of pastrami they do smoked corn beef. Probably the best smoked beef I have ever had. The color of the meat is what food porn videos are made of. The meat is so tender so juicy it is hard to put into words!

I will be back on every trip I make to Montreal!"}
{"text":"I was worried that this place would have lost its charm once Celine Dion took over but they didn't skip a beat. Smoked meat was delicious as usual and the bread and pickle were the same old. Phew!"}
{"text":"C'est un classique. Maintenant je vais au service pour emporter. 

Se faire un Smoked Meat chez soi avec leur pièce de viande est aussi bon en suivant la recette pour réchauffer la viande."}
{"text":"Great place!!!! If you are ever in Montreal make sure to stop here to get a smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle with a cherry cola!!!! I went at a good time and there was no line!!!! I recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place! Best smoked meat in town! I always go to Schwartz when I go to Montreal! It is a cozy, small and historic restaurant you have to go! I do recommend this place and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Obviously a right of passage if it's your first time in Montreal. This is my second time having Schwartz and the smoked meat did not disappoint! I'd always recommending coming earlier (before noon) because it gets packed and a line will form from outside the door."}
{"text":"Why are these people lined up for! The wait was worth it, generous serving size for the $12 tiny-smoked meat sandwich! Fast and friendly service. Bring cash or you will enjoy the lineup again! 

You can even buy their spices, but who cares, order more sandwiches, they are to die for! The bread is for decoration only, because there is 95% meat and 5% bread - pickle don't count. 

Did I mention there's a line to get in? don't worry, it moves fast."}
{"text":"The Montreal smoked meat here is no doubt excellent. A prime example of excellent price/quality ratio ($5.50 for a sandwich). Get the small plate (2-3 sandwiches) or large plate (4-5 sandwiches) for sharing (note there are sharing costs). Sides are extra. Place is a dive but those are the ones with the best food!
The place is definitely small, crowded, probably somewhat dirty but you just have to get over that. There is usually a line but even during lunch time on Saturday, it moves at a decent pace (nobody wants to linger, people really just eat their awesome sandwiches and leave). 
We got the lean meat... kinda wished I ordered the medium. Ah well, next time!

Tables are shared and the service was as expected (not condescending or rude in any way)."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwiches are amazing! The service is fast as well. I would suggest this place for a quick bite. Do not eat here if you are looking for a casual sit down meal. However, I am taking off a star because it is CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Best meal I had in Montreal. I went to this places with absolutely no expectations and was totally blown away. The smoked meat sandwich was so incredibly good. They have a few other items on their menu but the smoked meat is the real reason people come here. They also recommend getting a black cherry soda to go with it. I found it a little too sweet so I could take it or leave it.

Be aware that this place is CASH ONLY! They have an ATM on site but it doesn't work with American debit cards."}
{"text":"It's not a place you're likely to visit as a local but it's an easy place to find yourself when you're showing around tourists. The smokes meat a good if you take it spicy, but other than that it's just a random restaurant that serves decent food in a New York Diner atmosphere. The saving grace is the staff. Our 50+ year old waiter was a total boss. He had nicknamed the one guy at out table \"princess\" five minutes into our visit and it stuck. He was fun, quirky, informative and a great time."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal and everyone was saying, you want a smoked meat sandwich, you go to Schwartz.  So my wife's father took us there and was blown away.

As normal for this place, had to wait for a few spots to open, the decor and smells were very chic and cool.  Food came pretty fast and I was put into food heaven after sinking my first bite into glorious smoked meat.  Prepared to perfection. The pickle served with the meal was also the best I have ever tasted, it did not taste factory made

A must for anyone and everyone when they visit Montreal......it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"I had heard amazing stories of this deli from before I even went to Montreal. When I got to Montreal and saw the lineup, I was like \"are you *bleeping* kidding me?\" The lineup to get a smoked meat sandwhich or purchase smoked meat was about a half hour wait, no joke! So I walked all the way to the back of the store thinking to myself, how can people wait in a line this long for a freaking sandwhich? 

Throughout the course of my waiting I chatted with my friend, who was just as curious, and grumbled to myself that this must be overrated. I may have grumbled a little too openly as when we got closer to the front of the line the man who was slicing the meat said in his most Jewish/Brooklyn souding voice ever? \"Hey ladies, have you been here before?\" To which we answered no and that we were from Vancouver, and then just like something out of a New York TV show, he shouted down the line that \"hey we got some ladies over here all the way from Vancooovah\" and it was pretty much the most awesome part of my smoked-meat purchasing experience. He even made sure to shrink-wrap the meat we were taking back home to Vancouver. 

The sandwhich, well, it was pretty okay, I don't know if I would bother waiting in line that long again, but the pickkles.... well, that was worth waiting for! They were so big and so fresh and delish that I can hardly wait to go back and get a whole jar this year!"}
{"text":"two words: EAT HERE.

Everything is good. Try the 1/2 sour, it's a crunchy pickle. Amazing chicken but the smoked meat is a must. Always friendly service to top it off too."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat sandwich in the city. I was a doubter but now I have been converted. Long live Shwartz."}
{"text":"Place où évidemment il faut au moins passer une fois en visite à Montréal, tellement que le lieu est pittoresque et connu. Je ne sais même pas si vous venez vraiment pour la smoke-meat, vous venez pour le lieu. 

C'est un peu l'attraction de maso, car vous venez pour faire la queue, être serrés dans un endroit à la décoration très kitch et à l'ambiance bruyante. Vous êtes placé à la chaine sur une table avec d'autres personnes, car ici on rentabilise la moindre place pour satisfaire le plus grand nombre. Donc oui ce n'est pas ici que vous serrez chouchoutés et dorlotés comme clients. Mais vous en redemandrez!  

Bizarre, nan... C'est que ce restaurant familiale est devenu une véritable institution à Montréal. Vous venez ici pour prendre une bouffé de folklore, et ça les patrons l'on bien compris.

Donc oui, c'est touristique même archi touristiques, les plats sont bons mais n'étant pas experte en smoke-meat je ne peux pas vous dire si c'est la meilleure de la ville. 
Ce n'est pas très cher, la grande assiette suffit pour deux. Faites l'attraction au moins une fois, vous pourrez dire que vous l'avez fait et que vous avez mangé chez Céline. Oui, car c'est Céline Dion qui a racheté l'affaire. 

Bref, amusez-vous avec cet endroit mythique un peu désuet mais tellement fun!"}
{"text":"The must try : smoked meat sandwich & in house cherry soda! Personally not a soda person but their in house cherry soda was definitely worth to try though!"}
{"text":"The must hit spot anytime in Montreal. MMmmmmmmm smoked meat!"}
{"text":"I visited Schwartz's again during the evening hour on my recent visit to MTL, it was fairly busy and I ordered a large plate of meat with a pickle. Some how this visit did not bring me back the memories from my first visit a few years back. I found the meat a bit dry and Dunn's like. I specifically told the waiter to bring me fatty meat, but the meat did not have that melt in your mouth tasty sensation. Don't get me wrong, the food was still good, but not the same as I had remembered. This difference may be attributed to the fact that my first Schwartz experience was in the morning when the meat was fresh, moist and straight out of the Big plastic coolers they store their meat in.  I'd still recommend Schwartz, but try to go in the morning at 10:30am when they start serving FRESH meat."}
{"text":"One of the many advantages of living in Montreal is access to the most amazing smoked meat, a trademark food of the city. The most famous place to get your smoked meat fix is, of course, Schwartz's on St. Laurent street. You can tell which one is Schwartz's by spotting the line of excited tourists lined up down the block for a chance to get a seat! The meat (I get mine full-fat, not lean) is juicy and smoky and greasy and tastes amazing with a massive pickle and yellow mustard. Everything you could want from a smoked meat. But personally, I will not wait 30 mins for it-- I usually go to the Schwartz's STORE which is right next door to the restaurant and order mine as take-away.
My honest opinion: Schwartz's smoked meat is really delicious, but not that much more delicious than the smoked meat at le Main across the street! There is never a lineup at le Main, and although you won't get the novelty or feel of the real thing, the food is right on par."}
{"text":"This place blew my taste buds away!!!
The meat is smoked to perfection!
It's peppery, juicy, and the mustard just give it an extra kick.
If you're ever in Montreal this place is a must try.
There is always a line because the place is tiny, but just get in the to-go line to get your food faster."}
{"text":"I visited here several years ago while in town for a conference.  What else is there to say?  Sandwich was on point.  So glad I dropped in and would do so again in a heartbeat.  I ordered another to take to my hotel after I was done eating.  This place gives Katz in NYC a run for its money."}
{"text":"This is the perfect hole in the wall experience i wanted. The sandwhich was cheap, quick, simple yet delicious. If you want to try the local favorite deli, you have to try this place. They also have a dining area where you can sit down and order but we didn't want to wait in line. Judging by the number of people there, they are doing something right"}
{"text":"Love this place! Smoke meat is really good. The only problem : its really small and elbow to elbow seating isn't really pleasant."}
{"text":"If you ever visit Montreal, this place is MUST-TRY restaurant.  The best smoked meat sandwiches are served here! The waiting line may be long and the place doesn't really look modern, but it's worth the wait. You will not be disappointed by the quality of the food. Being a health-conscious person, I try to stay away from them, but the cravings are way too strong. I always find myself dropping by every month to grab one of their sandwich. It may look expensive, but you get a lot of meat between those two pieces of rye bread and oh, I love their fries too."}
{"text":"As good as the legends would have you believe. Only issue is they're quick to rush you out the door as so many people are waiting in line.

Still worth it."}
{"text":"OK, I'm a New Yorker and spoiled by having many great delis that have excellent meats. The smoked meat (brisket) sandwich that I had at Schwartz's was simply amazing. We lucked out and went on a Friday mid afternoon and still waited 20 minutes. We walked by there on the following Sunday and the line was all the way down the block. There is a Deli/Restaurant in our neighborhood in Brooklyn called Mile End and it appears to be directly connected to the neighborhood of the same name in Montreal. If you traveling through Montreal it's a must but plan accordingly as you may have a long wait. If you're traveling through Brooklyn, check out Mile End. On another note we tried a bagel place that boasted better bagels than New York....maybe they've never been to NYC and had a bagel. As they say \"It's the water.\""}
{"text":"Simply the best smoke meat sandwich I have ever had, and I live in NYC!  Do yourself a favor and go here--either their take out place or wait for the main restaurant."}
{"text":"a must stop when you are in montreal!

I was in Mtl for the weekend and wind up eating here 2 nights in a row!

The sandwiches here are unbelieveable! The smoked meat is so tasty and salty but so good. The bread definitely complements the meat!

Not much of a line up if you come either later in the evening.

Remember to leave a tip in the plate when you order take out and the servers will be extra nice and funny!"}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich has so much smoked meat it is likely to fall apart the moment you take a bite-in fact, you'll probably need 17 napkins just for the first half. But who cares?  It's so incredibly good, you'll be picking little bits of smoked meat off your lap to make sure you get every last bite.

I think Montreal has the best smoked meat in the world, and that Swartz's is by far the best place to get smoked meat in Montreal.  So by my logic, it stands to reason that this is the best smoked meat sandwich in the world. Despite the fact that your $7.64 will only get you the sandwich with no sides (trust me, you aren't likely to need much after consuming this sandwich), there is a constant lineup outside this place at all hours of the day.

For an extra charge you have the option of ordering your sandwich lean or medium, but I order mine straight up.  This is no place to quibble about fat."}
{"text":"Love this place....get here early...don't bother going on a Friday. I've been here a few times and this place never will disappoint you...be patient with the wait & when you order make sure you know 100% what you want."}
{"text":"A place that must be visited in Montreal. best Smoked-Meat i've ever seen can be found in this restaurant. 
Appreciated the special \"take-away\" queue when wanted only a smokes meat Sandwich. 
Can also buy smoked meat to make your own meals at home."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC, we did not expect to find anything even close to Katz Deli!! This place was just as good if not better! We started our vacation here because of all the online recommendations and made sure to come back one last time before we left because it was just that delicious!

My boyfriend and I shared the large plate, which comes with a huge plate of smoked meat and a plate of sliced rye bread, which allows you to make your own mini sandwiches. The meat was so juicy and tender it literally melts in your mouth. We also shared the poutine, which was really tasty as well!

Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Overrated in my opinion. Smoked meat is good but I prefer many other locations in Montreal."}
{"text":"Amongst all the hype, Schwartz's was OK.

There was a huge line to the restaurant so we opted for the \"take-out\" restaurant where you order at the counter and find an available seat. We ordered the smoked meat sandwich and a chicken sandwich and had a side of potato salad. He informed us the chicken sandwich was cold and asked if we would like mustard on our sandwiches.

The sandwiches were small but PACKED with meat. The smoked meat was ok. It tasted just like corn beef. But the chicken sandwich was surprisingly good. It was flavorful - lean but tender. Skip the potato salad, it was very bland.

Side note: there is no lock on their bathroom door. Do go in pairs so someone can watch the door for you."}
{"text":"I tried the smoked meat since it's a big thing in Montreal. It was good, but not anything I would go out of my way to have again. I think all the hype made it a bit of a disappointment. 

I also have mixed feelings about the staff. One woman, while polite once we got her attention, was completely oblivious to us, her face buried in her phone.

The guy who served us was rude, and short with us because we sat in the wrong spot. 

Overall, not a place I would want to return."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich looks intimidating at first glance. You might think it's too big and you might not finish it but I here to tell you not to fear! The meat is so tender that it will melt effortlessly in your mouth. 
Order a dill pickle, fries and a frank on the side for added pleasure. 

Good stuff but Katz NYC is still king"}
{"text":"Another MUST try from everyone who I mentioned I was going to Montreal to.  

Personally, I'm not quite sure I understand the hype, and didn't find the food that amazing (combined with some abrasive service) but the 25+ people waiting outside to get in when I left definitely shows I'm in the minority.  

Menu is above on the wall and it's really spelled out for first timers like me, so I ended up just getting what it seemed everyone else came for - The Smoked Meat Sandwich.  Again, not quite my taste, but the pickle I added was good lol.  No clue what the Combo plates are all about since I was slightly yelled at when I asked.... Also still wondering what a side of Nash is lol. 

CASH ONLY so be prepared."}
{"text":"Gooooood! Superb smoked meat. But just for a big bite,  not a dinner place.  Coleslaw just mediocre. More about the tourist draw and serving super sized volume than anything."}
{"text":"I love this place , the smoked meat is so damn amazing , I always order medium fat one and omg even now I am writing this it makes my mouth watery ! True that there is a long line up and u have to share tables but it worth it"}
{"text":"It's a great meat sandwich. The meat is so tasty and is just packed with flavor. I wish the bread was a little thicker though, I kept my sandwich in my bag for like 20 minute and the bread was already soaked through in grease. However, it was amazing. 

Definitely get a pickle, too! Definitely need that to balance out the greasiness of the meat. 

I would not recommend the potato salad, however. It was below average, possibly needed more salt. It also wasn't that creamy but more starchy if you know what I mean. 

However, the smoked meat is great! Salivating as I'm typing this out."}
{"text":"Smoked sandwich- tender, juicy, smoky...the meat literally melted in my mouth 
Pickle- It's a pickle
Coleslaw- very good, it's lighter than american coleslaw and tasted a little different 
Fries- meh
Liver- gross and chewy, not my cup of tea 
Sausage link- meh 
Cherry coke- yum"}
{"text":"I'm review 188!!! sha-bang!

the meat is awesome! that's all you need to know! 

smoked meat sandwich, with coleslaw and a pickle for your side, add a can of coke, omg i could do this everyday! too bad i live in Detroit :(

who want's to FedEx me another sandwich? back-channel me..."}
{"text":"Even though I've visited Schwartz's many times in the past, this time I'm Pretty sure I was FOOD POISONED after eating a smoke meat sandwich. I was vomiting 4 to 6 hours after eating it.
I think there was a rotten piece of fat around the meat that I should not have eaten. 
Also it needs to be served piping hot to reduce the bacteria on the meat!"}
{"text":"really tasty food, cheap, it's as good as people say. the only thing is that it's crowded and you will have to share a table with strangers, they don't let a single seat go to waste, and as soon as you're done eating they politely kick you out, but they kind of have to otherwise the lineup would be 5 hours long"}
{"text":"The medium cut smoked meat sandwich on rye is very good.  It tastes like an extra meaty and flavorful pastrami sandwich.  Unlike Katz's, you don't even need mustard or any other seasoning.  Needless to say, I brought back 2 pounds in sealed bags to bring home.  Portions are very generous and the prices are fantastic!  Just be warned that the line can get long."}
{"text":"The best of the best. We did not want to wait in the long line so we got them to go. They were really nice to separate to two bags - one for all the hot food and another one for all the cold drinks and food. We had poutine for the first time and it was so good. The meat sandwich was also lean and tasty, not too salty not too sweet. It went well with the cherry cola. We sat across the street and could see the line to get in to the restaurant was still long."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I live in Texas where we have delicious meats/brisket, etc. that I was pretty underwhelmed. It's good but not worth the wait in my opinion."}
{"text":"We skipped the dine in section and opted for the much shorter take out line.  The dine in like looked to be about an hour...we got take out in about 10 minutes.

The guys behind the counter were extremely helpful and made a few jokes which made the wait feel just fine.  The smoked beef is the way to go!  The beef is tender and amazing.  Comes on rye bread with some mustard and a pickle.

Highly recommended if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Dont get me wrong, the meal is great. But over the years, there are many fantastic smoked meat restaurant that have opened up that offer not only a better service, but more value for your money. Last time I went there (winter 2016), I was shocked to see I have to pay an additional $1.75 because I was sharing my fries with my son. If it wasn't for it's historic value, I don't believe the ratings would be as high.."}
{"text":"A fantastic and authentic Montreal experience. We ordered the smoked meat sandwich with cherry soda, a classic meal. We walked in and were almost immediately seated at the bar. The staff were really nice and accommodating considering how many tourists and jerks they probably deal with on a daily basis. It was pretty busy and the food was really quick. The brisket was delicious and paired perfectly with the cherry soda. I understand why Schwartz's is Montreal institution."}
{"text":"We have had lunch at Schwartz's every time we come to Montréal.  There's always a bit of a wait, but people are friendly and we're generally seated pretty fast.  There are a series of communal tables of 8.  It's not a place where you linger over your meal.  People order, eat and go.  We shared our table today w/ a couple of guys from Vancouver, a professional soccer coach and the team trainer/doctor.  They were nice guys.  Another couple at the other end of the table ate quickly enough that we didn't even find out where they were from.

We each ordered a smoked meat sandwich, Schwartz's specialty.  You have a choice of lean, medium or fat.  We chose medium.  Lean is reportedly too dry.  We overheard our server explain to someone that today's fat used to be medium 15 years ago, but cattle are being bred leaner these days, so they're unable to obtain the level of fat they used to.  We also ordered fries to share.  The fries came first.  There were fewer of them than at Steak Frites and they were much, much better.  The sandwiches were excellent, w/ rye bread that was on the small side and the smoked meat piled high.  It was a manageable portion and oh so tasty.

There are two bathrooms for the entire restaurant, one for men and one for women.  They are basic and clean.  You pay up front at the cashier.  Alan was out of Canadian money and only had a $20.  He paid for our lunch and got change but was unable to fight his way back through the crowd, which had grown pretty thick, to tip the server.  We felt bad about that, because he'd been friendly, patient and helpful.  It was difficult even to get out the door.  It's a popular place."}
{"text":"Yes, it's great, it's got viande fume or smoked meat, and it's insanely famous.  They provide good portions and good value in a charmingly bare bones deli style cafe, and if you get it \"medium fatty\" you'll be rewarded with a rich ribbon of fat that you can combine bite for bite with the more crumbly meat parts.

But if you are a foodie, I'm begging you to also try Reuben's downtown.  It's on my list of \"best evers\" for their more moist very of smoked meat. I tried both restaurants eight years ago when I was in town for a conference, and again last week, and came to the same conclusion: the moister, richer experience of Reuben's cannot be matched!

{"text":"Maybe I'm just not a fan of smoked meat but I didn't really find Schwartz that amazing and compared to the Main Deli across the street, Schwartz feels way too cramped for my liking.

Schwartz is usually packed.  I had to come here three times before I was actually willing to line up since the other two times had insanely long queues!  We were packed really tightly into a small table with very uncomfortable seating, right by the kitchen.  It honestly wasn't that great of an experience and I enjoyed the coleslaw at Main Deli more.

Anyways, I guess Schwartz's smoked meat itself may be a bit tastier than what you can get at Main Deli but I honestly don't find smoked meat that amazing. For me, the half hour line up wasn't too worth it but I'm sure there are tons of people who love smoked meat!  The prices are very reasonable too (compared to a quick meal in Vancouver I guess)"}
{"text":"Schwart'z is your typical tourist spot, every tourist knows to come and eat smoked meat here but is it worth it?

I haven't experienced any other smoked meat place before so I cannot really judge but after having waited in the queue for a good 30 minutes and having a plate of smoked meat placed before me I would say that it's not bad...It is what it is, smoked meat with two slabs of bread and whatever other sides you get to go with it aka pickles or fries. 

It's a Montreal specialty so I would say to eat here at least once but in terms of a regular restaurant spot...not really for me. But I guess I just don't find smoked meat to be all that special?

ALSO, THEY DON'T ACCEPT CARD!"}
{"text":"Je me doit de mettre un quatre,non pour LE meilleur endroit en ville pour leur smoke meat,mais le décors et la petitesse des places. Étant de grande stature,ces un peut serrer comme endroit! Sinon un \"must\" pour les amateurs de smoke meat."}
{"text":"The line is worth the wait! Sandwhich was nice and meaty! Automatically comes with mustard which was nice and the fat pickle was a great touch. There are two lines which I didn't notice at first. So if you see youself standing outside on line and just want to be in and out instead of sitting down and eating, make sure you check the inside line! A lot quicker and just as good. Don't forget the black cherry cola...delicious!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat if you love meat and not just meat but good smoke meat!!! The best in Montreal!!!  Menu is simple but amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Was really good smoke meat. Dont have the poutine the saice tastes like mop water in the janitor's closet LITERALLY!!"}
{"text":"Went here on an absolute whim. A ny'er with a buddy in Montreal who reccomeded the place. hit it up on the way back to NY. Damn was it bangin! didnt have to wait on line at all, got there literally when it opened, so i cant comment on the wait.  is it the cleanest/nicest place? no. does it serve great smoked meat sandwich (which is what myself and gf had) f yes! do yourself a favor and try this place whilst in a great city. don't know if its better than katz's or whatever other jew deli in ny, cuz i don't waste my time and money in nyc. but it was certainly bangin!"}
{"text":"my first impression of Schwartz's as i peaked through the window was this place is major old school, which makes plenty of sense since it's been in business since the early 20's. Seating is communal but there are seats at the counter. The menu is in French but the waiters speak English so don't worry about whipping out your pocket translator. i believe most people are there for one thing and one thing only which is their smoked meat. the smoked meat is similar in taste to corn beef. it's served on rye bread and with a touch of mustard. there's a good ratio of meat to bread. i was a bit worried there was going to be a huge tower of meat that i wasn't going to be able to finish. i also ordered a side of fries as it seemed like the thing to based on what other people were ordering. i feel a bit guilty but i sorta liked the fries more than the smoked meat. perhaps it was because good fries in the states is hard to come by or maybe smoked meat was not as good as i expected. i think it's fair to say it was a little of both. if you're a visitor like myself, i would recommend this place because it's cool to visit places that are rich in tradition."}
{"text":"All the tour books say that this is a must-try spot in Montreal and while sometimes that is a sign to actually stay away because it is overhyped or touisty, I definitely recommend that you try Schwartz's! In fact, I thought the corned beef, which has an extra layer of smokiness to it (compared to regular steamed/boiled corned beef), was better than stuff I had in New York! (I can hear gasps and cries of how unAmerican I am now)

When you go, do:
-be prepared to wait in line outside for 15-30 minutes and expect to be seated at a table with strangers. It's all good though
-order the regular, not lean. You ain't eating here because you're watching your calories.
-pass the mustard or ketchup or whatever your stranger-dining-mates on the other side of the table ask for.

Despite how small the dining room is and how crammed it is with people, it is fairly quiet inside. And after you take your first bite you too will shut up and understand why. :)"}
{"text":"I gotta say their smoked meat sandwich and pickle is delicious, sooo good.

However the place is shabby and small, often there's a lineup, and it's so warm in there that I question its sanitary condition :/ i see the dude cutting up the meat drenched in sweat... Doesn't reassure. Don't stare at the meat either, looks weird, greasy and just unappetizing if you're used to a lean clean diet.

If you like that dirty New York experience, go for it."}
{"text":"First order of business upon reaching Montreal.

Got 1 fatty, 1 regular smoked meat sandwich + fries.

My advice: just get the fatty sandwich. No point getting to Schwartz's and not going all out, fat is flavour! Also, would skip the fries, while they were good, save your appetite for the enormous sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place is a classic, the food is good, but the line is miserable. Sure, you can just go through the take out line, which is markedly faster, but if I'm in the mood to sit down and enjoy smoked meat this will not be my first pick. If you want to be seated quicker and have the choice to sit on a terrace I'd suggest the place across the street, Main."}
{"text":"Schwartz is a famous address and I understand why. There is a waiting line outside the door that the owners are probably used to see everyday. You will have either way:the poutine or the smoked meat. Go with the smoked meat. It is a small plate with a huge portion of greasy but amazingly tasty meat. I enjoyed myself but forced myself to finish my plate. That was the biggest mistake. Me and my friends got sick all day. To be honest I don't know if it was because of the cold, of eating too much meat or just just the too much fat. We also hd the french fries and 1 pickle. It was so so good but just too much for our stomach. We couldn't have diner the same night after 8hours of digestion. I would totally recommend this address to EVERYONE but please do not force yourself to finish you meat like we did . I know it s good and it s cheap but sometime we have to control what we eat for the sake of our body. Tomorrow i will try something else: the beaver tail (there is no salad in Montreal sorry)"}
{"text":"Suite à une émission diffusé sur France 5 peu de temps avant ma visite j'ai découvert Schwartz's et rien que les images m'ont données faim. Shawartz c'est un restaurant hébraïque qui est pris d'assaut le midi. Pour les pressé je vous conseil de passer votre chemin sauf si vous êtes seul car dans se cas il est plus facile de trouver une place.

A l'extérieur la queue peu atteindre 50m facilement de ce que j'ai vu mais lorsque je suis venu (un peu en avance) il n'y avait que 10 personnes dehors. Une personne se charge a l'entrée de demander combien vous êtes afin d'organiser au mieux ce qui permet des fois de se trouver a coté de personnes que l'on ne connait pas du tout.  En étant tout seul je me suis retrouvé au comptoir avec un Canadien et sa colocataire française qui venait d'arriver en PVT. Cela a été très utile puisqu'au final je me suis laissé guider par le canadien quand au choix : un sandwich, frite, une boisson et le fameux gros cornichon. Pour ce qui est du sandwich il n'y a pas non plus un choix énorme puisque la boutique est spécialisée dans la viande fumé qui est préparé le matin et qui marine pendant 8h ! Ceci dit la viande est vraiment délicieuse : elle fond dans la bouche et elle a un gout vraiment fin. Je tiens à saluer la dextérité du cuistot car il coupe ce jambon à une vitesse incroyable et sans y laisser un bout de doigt !

L'ambiance dans le restaurant est un peu bruyante mais tout va très vite et tout le monde parle avec tout le monde. J'ai bien discuté avec mes voisin pendant se rapide repas et j'ai appris pleins de choses sur Montréal et les endroits à faire. Si j'ai l'occasion de retourner à Montréal je referai ce restaurant même si ce n'est pas donné puisque j'ai payé 14 Dollars pour ce repas."}
{"text":"Omg totally took tips from previous yelpers and went for take-away. No queue! :D This was a Saturday lunch time on a nice summer day!
Absolutely floored by the juicy flavourful smoked meat and super cost efficient!
The bread and pickles go well and they are quite inexpensive, too! Filling meals :D"}
{"text":"I usually hate eating tons of meat on my dishes but this, I will make an exception, this dish tastes awesome. The staffs were chatty and incredibly nice. I left out one star because the place is not very clean and it can get quite crowded (the restaurant is small)."}
{"text":"Wow. The smoked meat almost melt in your mouth. The scene is just what you'd expect from an old diner. Great service. A must in Montreal. 

Note: They only accept cash."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is good but not great. 

They are famous for being condescending but I feel this is mostly an act to keep up Schwartz's reputation."}
{"text":"Everyone in Montreal knows that you have to visit Schwartz.  Everywhere we visited, the locals exclaimed that this is the place to be.  Our hotel was in the Latin Quarter portion of Montreal and we were able to comfortably walk to Schwartz.  Expect to wait for a table, locals and tourists alike are frequent eaters.

The tables there are long and are co-ed.  The service and the customers are super friendly and everyone is so excited to be eating there.  We ordered a medium smoked meat and it was a little dry, we ordered a second one and it was much more juicy.  Since, they cut the meat there, not all meat is consistent.  I would recommend just going fatty, it will be way juicier and flavorful.  Heck if you're visiting, its just one meal, make it worth it!  

All you need to know is:
Smoked Meat Sandwich (lean, medium and fatty) - the fattier it is, the more delicious it will be
Black Cherry Coke."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is a landmark in Montreal (the other being the poutine at La Banquise) and is the reason why the city is famous for its smoked meat sandwiches. 

As you may have noticed from the photos, the sandwiches are basically 90% meat and 10% bread. It takes skill and training to be able to eat the sandwich while keeping it intact. The meat is oh-so tender and, in the true Quebecois fashion, is grease through and through. The mustard also blends well with the grease. 

On any given day you'll see a mix of tourists and locals lining up in front of Schwartz's for a bite of the delicious meat. The wait is normally around 30 minutes, but you can shorten that wait to 15 minutes if you get takeout instead (at the takeout shop right next door)."}
{"text":"I am not even going to elaborate. You don't need my stinkin review. Just go here, try to snatch up a table and order your smoked meat medium, fries, pickle and cole slaw. You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious smoked meat!  The fat is still gelatinous, the smoke is flavorful, the meat is delicious, and it's just a simple, fast, amazing sandwich.  I'm not much of a meat person or a sandwich person, but I'll gladly have one every time I come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! I got a smoked meat sandwich....its famous for this food!! As expected from a signature place, the sandwich was amazing! Will definitely go there in my future visits to Montreal."}
{"text":"A wonderful, unassuming, simple place. The smell of smoked meat that hits you when you enter the shop/restaurant is otherworldly. I had the beef sandwich, medium (apparently the fatty one is too fatty, and the lean one is too dry). The quality of the meat is fantastic, and the bread is soft and doughy. 

I actually wouldn't have minded a little more fat on my cut- I found it a little dry. It's probably a matter of taste, and it was delicious nonetheless, but if I return I will be sure to order the fat cut.

The line for the main restaurant was extremely long. Granted, the restaurant is picturesque and more of an experience- but if you just want a quick bite to eat, the take-out shop is just as good. They have tables in the back, and serve exactly the same items."}
{"text":"It's the one and only holy Grail and most sought after place to have smoked meat. 

On a recent trip in May I brought some out of towners who wanted to eat here. Let's get things straight. Yes it's a small place and they can boss you around as a patron(like a bistro in Paris). You order lean or medium fat. Lean is dry in my opinion (need the extra mustard to choke it down) and medium is what you want to get if you want flavour. 

On our visit the service was very cordial polite and one of the guys working says they go through around 2000lbs of brisket a day there. That's a lot of beef. However this is the place to come in MTL and the tourists love it up. In Montreal you can get smoked meat at pretty much any sandwich shop in town. Heck, across the street is the Main, Ruebens on St Catherine or Snowdon Deli, smoke Meat pete's (Ile Perrot) all serve it up quite well. My favourite is in Laval at George's.  

Schwartz's did deliver for my out of town guests and I was mildly impressed. I've eaten here probably six times in 10+ years. This visit sure impressed them and that's what counts. My sandwich was decadent and delish as usual. I wouldn't wait more than 20 minutes for a table here but lineups are quite common. On our visit we lucked out big time to get a table very quickly. 

Great place to bring out of towners but I don't plan to go back unless I have to!"}
{"text":"In Montreal and must try their famous Smoked meat sandwich! It's $9.75 and worth every penny.  The meat is so tender and some parts are fatty but most delicious. You can taste the pepper in it. The bread is nice & soft. The mustard complements it really well.  Come here hungry because it's a lot of meat. Coming from NY, the like this more than Katz deli. 

Btw, Cash only and walking distance from bus #55 stop."}
{"text":"Came here as a last stop before heading back to NY. They open at 9am and we got here at 9:45am but we were told the hot meats won't be available until 10:30am. It was worth the wait. We walked around the area for a bit and when we returned there was already a small line forming. Once 10:30 hit, everyone went inside and if you were eating there, you just seat yourself and wait to have your order taken. Overheard someone ordering the turkey and the waiter said \"don't get the turkey, that for vegetarians..get the smoked meat!\" Haha.
Ordered the smoked meat sandwich and it was amazing. The meat and the bread just melts in your mouth. Definitely a place to check out if you are in the area but be prepared to wait in line."}
{"text":"Really love the number four sandwich. It tasted great with the yellow mustard. 
Black Cherry Soda was good too. Special in Montreal."}
{"text":"This is the most famous smoked meat place at Montreal. One sandwich contains at least 13 slices of meat. The homemade cucumber was a bit salty and sour because it is homemade. Technically everything in this store is homemade. The mustard was good."}
{"text":"So much hype,  is it worth it? I've gotten smoked meat from Schartz from friends when they came back from Montreal, always froze them and then take them out when I want to eat it by steaming it and putting it onto a toasted bagel. Really good. But since I came all the way to Montreal, decided to try a fresh made smoked meat sandwhich. It was really good and very full. Tons of meat packed in, perfectly flavored and juicy. Took another lb of meat home with me. A lb is under $14 and I think it's totally worth it. A nice treat to have once in a while."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich (we got medium fat) was good but nothing amazing or mind-blowing. Pickle was pretty good though. My sister and I are not big fans of brisket/pastrami-style sandwiches, so if you're not crazy about these sandwiches, don't bother trying out this place. But if you love that kind of sandwich, then yeah, I guess you should try it out. The meat was tender and well-balanced with lean meat and fat, but it tasted pretty bland and boring to me."}
{"text":"We'd been directed to Schwartz's by several people as the best place for a meat sandwich in Montreal, but those people have clearly never been to Chicago We got there early for lunch, 11:30, and had no wait for a table. I had the medium smoked meat sandwhich as instructed, and it was good. I wish the bread were just a bit more rye and I wanted the mustard to be brown and not yellow, but that might be an Iowa thing. The brisket was pretty moist and peppery but certainly not the best sandwiches I've ever had.  The pickle was good, we bought a jar to bring home and those are even better, smaller and crisper. What I was surpised by was the flavor of the frankfurter that my daughter ordered! It was yummy and smoky on the grill. 
Overall, I wouldn't wait for this place for more than 5 minutes. There is better food in Montreal!"}
{"text":"What a cool place for lunch. If you love smoked meat you will love Schwartz's. All of the food is great and the service is super friendly and fast.

The place is really cute. All the meats are savory and so tender. They also have great sides. It can get crowded but the wait is not terrible. This is a must stop if you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"After leaving Montreal for a year, one of the first things I did was go to Schwartz. You really appreciate their smoked meat, when you have had to do without it. Nothing comes to close their quality."}
{"text":"This was our 1st destination in Montreal, and we were able to find street parking really close by.  However, I think Schwart's was way too hyped up for me, and I wasn't prepared to stand outside in the snow for 20 minutes to eat the smoked meat sandwich.  

We were seated at a crowded table close to others, which made it fun and the full hole in the wall experience.  The menu is limited, but there are some other choices beyond just the smoked meat sandwich.  When the sandwich comes, there's a massive stack of meat (go for medium).  I was disappointed in the bread, though.  Mustard is pungent and strong in a good way.  Pickles are also crunchy and cool to counter the heaviness of the sandwich.

Service was surprisingly patient and nice, even though we were probably slowing them down with our indecisiveness and lack of familiarity with the menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Best smoked meat in Montreal. I had  twice even I only stay in montreal for 3 days. Huge lineup during lunch time. It's a very small takeout shop right beside the restaurant. Good option for ppl just wanna takeout and advoide lining up."}
{"text":"This place is what makes Montreal smoked meat very popular, and is the essence of every Montreal visit.

Everyone has mentioned the flavour of the smoked meat, but the rib steak is awesome as well! I'd highly recommend the Schwartz's combo if you're hungry, filled me up to the point I had to take the rest of it home!

Definitely recommend this place. It may be touristy, but there's a reason why."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is about this local institution.  Got a smoked meat sandwich.  It was dry and not all that full of flavor."}
{"text":"I was super excited to check out this place, but after ordering the medium smoked meat sandwich, it wasn't as scrumptious as expected.  My meat seemed to be a bit on the dry side and the rye bread just wasn't the best either, although it was still very tasty!  The others ordered the \"large plate\" (where they give you a STACK of meat and bread and you make your own sandwiches) so its totally worth the money.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Omy was there a line!! 
Smoked meat was quite delicious, but I still don't understand the hype! I prolly wouldn't wait more than 15 mins in line for this place, but definitely give it a try. Twas a great late night dinner. 
(Thankfully, when my friends & I went, the fella asked if there were any parties of three in line, and as we were a party of three, he ushered us - and another group of three - into the place and sat us next to each other. No complaints for skipping the wait)! 

So~
+ They seat you, you order, finish the meal, then pay up front.
+ If you order smoked meat you get asked how much fatty meat you'd like (lean, medium, or real fatty). I got the medium but I may try the fatty if I get the chance to return.
+ The yelp photos are pretty spot on.
+ Smoked meat, coleslaw, & french fries were yummy.
+ Quick efficient service with funny and conversant servers! 
+ Small, tiny restaurant thats quite cozy. Love that the walls are filled with interesting stuffs and love the super casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Smoked beef, smoked beef, smoked beef.

Awesome smoked beef (recommend either fatty or medium cut, otherwise it's a little dry).  Different from the pastrami from Katz's but on par in terms of quality.  I prefered the platter over sandwich because it means more meat.  Also, pickles are awesome.  This is a place you must try if you are visiting Montreal.  Cash only and you may have to wait in line outside but it's worth it."}
{"text":"If you want to sit down and eat you better be prepared to a) wait in a line on the street and b) share a table with strangers. In any other setting either scenario may have surprised or irked me, but on this day I was so game for it and ended up thinking these two features added so much charm and warmth to the place.

The smoked turkey sandwich was moist, tender, and so yummy. Topped with mustard on white bread, heaven. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The dill pickle was massive and damn good. And the cole slaw was barely dressed and some of the best I've ever eaten. 

Our server was excellent! He was funny, personable, and super fast. With such quick turn over I was expecting crap service and not planning to hold anything against it. But our guy could probably serve the whole place with his eyes closed and just rock it. I loved him.

Super cheap, quick food, awesome setting, great value. Must go. No wonder this place has the best reviews and is the highest rated. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Thanks to all of these reviews, my husband and I knew what we wanted immediately when we took our place at the end of the line for the restaurant. 
We noticed the mini- store next door and went inside. The line was short into the restaurant but we took a gamble to enter what we found was a deli that served what we wanted for our meal- two medium smoked meat sandwiches,  a pickle to share, black cherry soda, and a small side tub of macaroni salad. The back area had counter style seating and was only half full. Super comfortable, our meal was made right in front of our eyes in less than 2 minutes, and we were able to see the meat in the smoker (located behind the deli area) twice! 

This deli is mostly for takeout, but we had no issue eating in the back. Super experience!"}
{"text":"I went to Schwartz's a couple years ago and it was a fantastic experience to have the original Montreal smoked meat sandwich. The food was absolutely fantastic, everything I imagined that it would be. The sides were perfect matches, and the meat was true to its roots the very definition of smoked meat. The biggest downside were lines were insanely long (almost an hour wait) and the service was rushed."}
{"text":"You should shun anyone from your life who doesn't like Schwartz's. It is a litmus test for every relationship you should have.

Everyone should sit inside at least once. If you've done that once, then skip the line and go to the Take-Out spot to the left. While they have a more limited menu, the wait is a fraction of the time, and they take credit cards in that location.

Loss of a star because the cashier was staring into her phone the whole transaction. HELLLLLO I'm asking you a question....?"}
{"text":"It's everything I dreamed of and more.  Excellent tasting, delicious smoked meat piled high and steaming hot atop what seems to be bread made there (not 100%, didn't see any signs).  Sat at the counter and the guys were joking with customers in three or four different languages while I was there. Talk about great customer service.  I'll be going back at least a couple times more before I leave Montreal and am sure I'll be craving this place when I get back to Seattle."}
{"text":"If I had just two sandwiches to eat as a last meal, they would both be here.

Holy stars, hundreds of little smoked briskets being coaxed to perfection for our enjoyment.? This place is ridiculous.

It's time for a St. Viateur bagel for dessert."}
{"text":"This is the Montreal smoked meat mecca. That being said, the lines and crowds will reflect that. I don't think a trip to Montreal actually counts unless you visit Schwartz's, but apparently a LOT of other people feel the same. The menu is limited and its a strictly a cash only business but that does not seem to deter anyone.
We arrived to find ourselves about fifty people back in line. However, we may have gotten lucky as within about five minutes someone came out and advised that there was room for four at the counter. Suprisingly everyone ahead of us declined - although they are specific to state it had to be a party of four. When you're this busy you cannot afford any empty seats apparently.
Perhaps the food tastes better at a table but I find it hard to believe. The sandwiches and pountine were absolutely amazing and none of my many trips here has every disappointed. Sure, they're not cheap and their might be better Montreal smoked meat out there - but this place is great and a real institution. While I've never done it myself, those pressed for time might consider the take out option and picnic nearby - weather permitting. 
Over-hyped? Perhaps, but the staff is always friendly, the food consistently good and places like Schwartz's seem to be disappearing so I plan to continue to visit every time I get the chance!"}
{"text":"They are defiantly good at the smoked meat sandwich, there is a good reason they are so famous for it. Having had it, I don't think I would wait more than 40 min. to eat it though. Service was great, no complaints there. Seating is cozy but not intimate, unless your group takes up the whole table you will probably end up sharing it with others at some point during your meal. Overall we enjoyed our food and would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best pastrami you'll get in Canada. Good spot - and they know it. But fun, attentive service, which I appreciate since they probably don't have to be."}
{"text":"Stopped by this famous establishment last night. There was a sizeable line but if you go inside you can order to go. The guy behind the counter is pretty curt, it reminds me of the soup nazi from Seinfeld, but with a better sense of humor. My group all ordered the fries and the famous smoked sandwich. It's nowhere near as big as Katz's in NYC, but half the price. The meat was tasty and I enjoyed the bread. I wouldn't call it the best sandwich of my life but it's worth the trip to say you've been there."}
{"text":"Their smoked meat is worth the wait. Likes are usually long, with no heat while you wait- i would recommend take out of the smoked meat sandwich"}
{"text":"Of course we had to stop there as this was one of the first 'raved' places in Montréal that I have read about.  We got there on a Sunday morning (~10:00), so it wasn't crowded yet.  We easily got a table without a hassle.

We got the smoked meat sandwich (on rye bread).  Modest looking sandwich, but the quality was superb!  The meat was tasty and smoked really nicely.  I'm not a big rye person, but the rye bread went really well with the meat.  Got coleslaw that was ordinary and french fries that was really good (I'd say almost sweet-tasting)."}
{"text":"Meilleur smoke meat au monde. 
Oubliez le Katz's à New York ou le Main sur St-Laurent, le Benn's le Dunn's au centre ville. 
Le Schwartz est dans une catégorie tout simplement à part. 
Mise en garde: la ligne d'attente peut être longue à tout moment de la journée. Mais elle en vaut le coup."}
{"text":"If you are drunk at 2am THIS IS THE PLACE to go. Also, if you are sober at 2pm, this is the place you should go...

This place has a classic feel and although some people might not like the table sharing I thought it was great way to bring conversation together. My friends and I got the regular special meat sandwiches and frites not expecting much. I mean it's just a sandwich with mustard and meat- how very wrong I was! We ended up here a few nights in a row on our very first trip to Montreal. Just stop reading and go right now !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for cheap and delicious smoked meat sandwich. Every time I go I definetely get their smoked meat sandwich and fries. I havent eaten better smoked meat than the one here in Montreal. You have the choice of how you want the meat cooked. Last time I went, because you sit with other people at the same table, we even had a nice conversation with tourists and locals sitting next to us. 

The only thing is there's always a big line, so you have to find that time of the day that is not very busy to go in quickly."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for lunch on a Monday in  June. It was raining and luckily found parking on the street. We got there and didn't see a line at 11am. The staff speak english and French.  We ordered the famous pastrami on rye bread and didn't wait too long. The pastrami was tendered on the rye bread. The fries was freshly cooked and tasty too. The cashier lady was nice and friendly and she urges everyone tip the staff which I don't mind. She mentioned that Celine was the owner of this place. By 11:30am, the place was so crowded and people was waiting inside and outside. I highly recommend this place. Ryan Gosling came here too."}
{"text":"This is a NO BRAINER. Yeah, the line sucks poutine gravy and it just may be considered a touristy spot. When you're standing in front of the joint, you'll find yourself asking if it's worth the wait. Don't be discouraged though, the line is most likely for the sit down side of Schwartz's. That's how we felt until we found the line to the take out/away which was much shorter and quite fast. The menu is simplified to the max. Three types of sandwiches, poutines, and pickles. All you need is their infamous smoked meat sandwich (first one on the sign, about $10 CAD). The other two sandwiches I can recall is turkey and pastrami. 

The line probably took us about 10-15 minutes and we got the food the second we placed the order. It's not prepackaged, they just have guys continuously pumping them out. That's why the menu for the take out side of the house is very minimal. We grabbed a few of their #1 smoked meat sandwiches and headed across the street to hang out like hoodlums and enjoy the feast. Trust me, we weren't the only ones doing this. 

The smoked meat is super tender and not too salty. I wished they had grey poupon available! The sandwich comes with a little mustard but I would suggest adding a little more to spruce up all that meat that is going into your mouth. That's all the sandwich really is; soft white bread, tons of meat, and a dab of mustard. Sounds boring, right? But really it's not. Initially it's like meh but then it leaves you with a lasting impression that comes out of nowhere. We even had this after a full blown meal nearby. I will say, one order for a single person will definitely put you in a coma.

If ever in Montreal, don't pass this up especially if you're not a local like myself. It's an one time deal until you come back on another trip. They've been in business since about 1928; it's practically an iconic landmark. The dine in line sucks but just opt for the take out line and eat it elsewhere. You'll be on your way to the next eating adventure in under 30 minutes. 

Cash only, be ready to sling that CAD$."}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype! One of the best meals in Montreal. Smoked meat (medium fat) sandwich with fries, pickle and cherry coke.  Delish!"}
{"text":"Oh my God this was delicious. A great big meat sandwich with a nice side of fries and can of black cherry.
The secret to getting in is to come on akward hours (not lunch or dinner time) and to arrive in small groups, id say 4 max (unless you dont mind waiting). I went with one friend and we skipped a long line because they only had room for two."}
{"text":"the reviews all sound great---but one big question----is it kosher. it could be---no mixing of milk and meat. all the meats could be kosher,  but is it kosher??

sounds wonderful!"}

Pour une place qui est supposée être un incontournable de Montréal, je suis déçu.
Côté nourriture, j'ai mangé mieux ailleurs. Et le prix est un peu forcé.
Bref, une place qui capitalise sur son nom que je ne conseille pas"}
{"text":"This place is worth the visit and to wait on line for. We ordered the smoked meat sandwich, coleslaw, and a Cott pop (black cherry soda). They offer three meat options; lean, half and half, or fatty. We went with half and half. My goodness the smoked meat is succulent, coleslaw is okay, and the black cherry pop is the best I've had so far. Compare to Katz...Schwartz's in the lead. But Katz's portion is bigger. I will definitely come back if I'm in town again."}
{"text":"I rolled in at 11pm on a weeknight, hoping that it'd be relatively empty. Boy I was wrong. I am a tourist to the city and could barely say Bonjour, so it was all overwhelming. Nevertheless, I pushed on ahead and sat down at the counter and ordered a smoked meat sandwich.

It tasted fantastic and salty. The mustard complimented it well. The meat was so tender that it fell off the fork. I had to eventually eat it with a fork because it just didn't hold together as a sandwich."}

{"text":"AMAZINGGGG!!!!
cheap and good food, what more can you ask for
Only 6 bucks for a smoked meat sandwich...try the black cherry and the sausage too
I only gave 4 stars because of the 30mins line up and cramped place, if you are going with only 2 people be prepared to eat in a table with strangers because its a very small place"}

{"text":"It was just OK, I've had better, we ordered the smoke meat and a second sandwich, turkey with a side of fries.

Service was friendly, average prices and we had to wait in line for about 10 minutes (lunch hour).  Hate to say, not worth it, maybe if you've never had a smoked meat sandwich, go for it, but otherwise you can skip it."}
{"text":"Had to try the famous smoked meats of Montreal and this seemed to be one of the most popular so we had to hunt it down and see for ourselves what all the hubub was about...worth the drive. This little Jewish Deli with the french sign is a throw back to old school Deli's that you only just see in movies unless you are lucky enough to grow up with if you grew up in certain New York neighborhoods and such...I was not one of the lucky ones so I enjoyed the heck out of the small community seating and yes, even waiting in line to get in because of the locals we had the chance to meet and chat with. Once inside, the staff was fast and friendly, making sure all kept rolling like a well oiled machine. You could tell the locals because they did not linger like us tourists but rather ate and got the heck out so others could get in...we were to busy absorbing the local culture for those kinds of niceties...that being said, they were kind enough to allow me to eat the poutine I purchased at their take out spot next door in side the Deli with the rest of my group that was having the sandwiches...they all raved about how delicious their meat was so I offered to share my poutine for some of that incredible smoked meat...it was a good trade =)"}
{"text":"Overrated.  Not worth the wait.  Not even sure what cut of meat the \"smoked meat\" comes from.  They don't say.  At least at Katz, you either order a pastrami or corned beef sandwich.  Here, the sandwiches are just simply called \"smoked meat\"  What is that?  Isn't it either pastrami or corned beef?  I don't get it."}
{"text":"This place is a staple and everyone kept talking about the smoked meat sandwiches of Montreal so I had to try it. I think my issue is that there was too much hype over the smoke meat sandwich at Schwartz's that while it was good, I didn't quite understand the hype. Schwartz's is a traditional Jewish deli where the tables are too close together and there's too much fluorescent lighting. The smoked meat sandwich is basically a pastrami sandwich with mustard. While it is quite good, how good can a pastrami sandwich with mustard be? Check it out because it's a thing but if you're from the states and frequent Jewish delis, you're not going to be too impressed. The service here was fast which was great and the pickles were quite tasty as well."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my smoked meat sandwich and pickle!  An absolute must-visit if you are in Montreal.  Get the smoked meat sandwich."}
{"text":"THIS. PLACE. IS. AMAZING. Tip: if you don't mind not having a booth, go to the takeout side and eat at one of the long tables in the back or outside. The line for dine in was SO LONG. We decided to just do takeout and It was super fast. We got the smoked meat sandwich, smoked meat poutine and regular poutine.  I cannot wait for my next trip to Montreal so I can grub on a delicious smoked meat sandwich from Schwartz's!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE BEST. We stayed in Montreal for 3 days, 2 nights, and stopped by Schwartz's a total of 4 times. It is just so good and you can't beat that price. We got take-out the first time and ate it in the small seating area-- we got seats for the four of us, no problem, even during lunchtime. There was no way we were waiting in the freezing cold for a table to eat something like this. Although one of the nights we went late, around midnight, so we sat in the main restaurant because there was no line. Take-out closed by then anyway. 

I was a bit skeptical about the pickles, so we didn't get them. Instead we got two different slaws, one was a very interesting vinegar based style, the other was more mayo. Both were cool, but I think I prefer the mayo. And of course, each time we got the smoked meat sandwich. Rye bread and mustard!! Though I usually end up putting on more mustard on it. YUMMM. Fries on the side is great too. 

BUT AGAIN, the price!!! I realize it's not exactly the same thing, but I'm a die hard fan of Katz's or Harold's pastrami in NY/NJ. I am actually willing to spend 14 bucks on that pastrami, so you definitely can't say no to this smoked meat, which is effing delicious as well, but about half the price. 

We went 4 times in 3 days. NUFF SAID!"}
{"text":"Montreal smoked meat sandwich is a must! We went around 11am and there wasn't a lineup yet. Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Medium fat smoked meat on rye!"}
{"text":"There's always a line here, but if you go to the take out section it's way quicker and theres a small seating area in the back. Great smoked meat, get the original. The meat is so soft and tender. This place reminds me of Katz in NYC which I feel is very similar."}
{"text":"Smoked meat is all I eat when I go there, I don't know why, nothing else tickled my fancy. Get your smoked meat at any deli they all taste the same to me."}
{"text":"Schwartz vs. Katz

first time trying smoked meat was Dunn's in Vancouver. so the first thing we ate while in Montreal for the Gran Prix was the infamous Schwartz's smoked meat, but before the visit i read some articles (Montreal vs NYC) of how Schwartz's was better,... better even than the king of all jewish delis,... Katz in NYC. now if i've never had smoked meat or a Katz pastrami before to compare especially 4 days later, I would've agreed, but I have and did. 

http://tinyurl.com/Montreal-vs-NYC 

first... schwartz's smoked meat vs dunns is not the same. dunns was more pastrami like in seasonings and flavor, while schwartz's is more corned beef. 

to the new there's a huge difference in look but even more important, in taste. pastrami is bolder, smokier, and one they forgot... \"darker\",... not just in its crust... but the color of the meat. pastrami also uses the naval, and corned beef uses the brisket, and there is a difference in texture and a bite.

and to the point of this review. the writers and bloggers in the link does not know what they are talking about, or they forgot to use the word preference. mind you ive only had smoked meat twice (Vancouver and Montreal) and Katz countless times while in NY (25yrs). one could even say that i'm a bit bias, but i haven't had a Katz pastrami since 2012, and while ive had other delis in LA in between, i haven't tasted a katz pastrami for nearly 3 years so my palate has been pretty much Katz's free. i think im able to make a fair comparison having had both in a span of 4 days, and if Schwartz's was better I have no problem stating that. 

nothing on this planet comes close to a Katz Pastrami,... noth-innng. not even Katz corned beef can touch their pastrami. even if you say that you've had both, my next question,.... how many days apart and did you have it to stay while it was still hot. 

i will upload two pictures of both sandwiches and feel free to message me who looks better, and tell me which one would make you run out and get one. also one was close to room temp and the other a bit warmer cause of the steamers they use before slicing (Katz).

other differences is their choice of mustard, Katz uses what we call deli mustard (spicy) and Schwartz's uses yellow. ordered the smoked meat \"medium\" with no mustard and Katz \"juicy\" also no mustard, but one was on rye the other on club bread (NYC). both looked juicy and both had a very distinct and different aroma. based on smell alone, Katz made my mouth water more and i was hungrier while at Schwartz's. texture its Katz all the way. brisket when cooked too long will fall to pieces, and that's why its used for american slow smoked BBQ. Katz was like biting into an aged prime cut of steak cooked perfectly, tender and juicy.

you really can't go wrong with either one, but it comes down to if you like bolder vs milder. if you like Nirvana in your taste buds then its Katz, but if you like Vivaldi then its Schwartz's. with or without mustard Katz wins the flavor and taste test for me because its \"very ape\" in every bite. when it comes to juiciness its a draw, and you can see how juicy both sandwiches are in my pics. 

one aspect we did like at Schwartz's they don't allow you to pile on BS toppings like cheese, russian dressing and coleslaw or sauerkraut like Katz's. great deli is like a great steak, its great on its own. the only thing on both should be a super light schmear of mustard in a bite. that's why its always best to order no mustard so you can add it accordingly on every bite. plus it allows you to taste the meat on its own. 

we did like the vinegar based Montreal coleslaw vs the mayo based, and we both said we could eat that with anything. the pickles could be more sour cause it was like eating wet cucumbers. 

in the end both sandwiches are great in their own right and it will come down to preference. in fact both places are so a like that when I walked in Schwartz I thought I was walking into a smaller Katz which was a good thing."}
{"text":"Maybe I am spoiled by the NY \"smoked meat\" AKA pastrami... It's just OK here. It's not as moist, and a bit stringy, rubbery. The flavor was on point, but there was something off for me so the wait was not worth it."}
{"text":"Smoked meat piled high
on a thin slice of rye
What more could you want?
And why?

Almost $8 for a tasty sandwich, not bad. About half as much as those famous delis in NYC. Possibly a tad drier than those, but that's what mustard is for! Somehow, it doesn't feel as sinful either."}
{"text":"during my BEB 2013 journey...

you know this place has to be guud if the line is covering and blocking the window view/entrance of the stores next to it.

The smoked meat here is aweeeesome. Not too smokey where its painful to eat, but cooked and smoked to the perfect tenderness. The cool thing about this place was that you were able to choose what kind of smoked meat you wanted. Your given an option of smoked meat with no fat, smoked meat with a little fat, or smoked meat with a lot of fat. Obviously...for me...gotta go for the smoked meat with LOTS OF FAT! Yah I know its not healthy for you...but for me: ITS WHERE ALL THE GUUDNESS AND FLAVORS ARE! 

We also ordered a side of french fries and dill pickles. The fries tasted like fries and the dill pickles tasted a bit different, but in a guud way. 

One of the highlights of this restaurant...the server kept on talking about this \"cherry soda.\" He talked about it so much that I had to order one. THIS CHERRY SODA WAS SOOO AMAZING! It literally was the best cherry soda that Ive ever had! If Guinness Book of World Record had a category for best cherry soda in a can...it has to be the one that this restaurant has! ITS A MUST GET! Goes great with the smoked meat! This soda was sooo guuud that I bought another one TO-GO after the meal!

Anyways...service was fast and quick. The size of the restaurant was very small...so be ready to get cozy with some strangers. Vibe and environment was awesome...always filled with upbeat and energized people.

P.S. get the plate! who eats bread/carbs anyways right? And plus...you get a free side of bread when you order the plate.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^"}
{"text":"As someone who doesn't care much about sandwiches, I was a bit skeptical coming to try the FAMOUS MOST DELICIOUS Sandwich in Montreal.... But I was proven wrong!!!! 

Check out my experience on video https://youtu.be/Q186qvy7c3I

I was worried that there would be a long line as everyone I talked to, yelp and Trip Advisor mentioned how crazy the line at any given time! We arrived a little bit past 5pm and there was a short line of 3 people... the inside looked different than the photo too... later I realized WE WERE at the to-go spot ahahahah!! Well, no worry!!! Shorter line and there are seating areas in the back!!! Yes, counter seatings only but hey, we pretty much had the whole area for ourselves!! (well, there were a couple others who joined us later on).

We ordered two smoked meat sandwiches.. one medium fat and one fatty!!! Yes, choose how lean/fat your meat... 1 Regular poutine to share and we also grabbed a couple of Cherry Sodas from the fridge per other reviewers' recommendation. Total 38 CAD!

The order came out FAST! We had to wait 5 minutes for the poutine...

Poutine was amazing!!! the cheese was gooey and stringy.. yummmmmm!!!!! they were generous with the gravy too OMG!!!! flavor explosion in my mouth!!! A bit salty but yummmmmmm :)

The smoked meat sandwiches.. o gosh!!! I was so worried it would be wayyyy too salty.. but one bite and I was in smoked meat heaven!!! Both hubby and I preferred the fatty meat as it was juicier.. you need that little bit of fat to enjoy life! It wasn't overly fatty.. no worry!! Washed it down with the \"oh-so-refreshing\" cherry soda!! BAM!!!! amazing simple meal!!! So so so so so good!!!

If you visit Montreal, come here to check it out!!! They dosed each sandwich with lots of meat.. so you could even order extra slices of bread to make more sandwiches! so so so so good and memorable!"}

I have continuously been served my food late... After the people who have come in after me. Schwart has a better, juicer meat. There pickles are out of this world."}
{"text":"US California review here!

This review won't be long. Just order number four like everyone else and a plate of fries and call it a day!

It's the brisket sandwich. Delicious Tender beef!!! The bread is whatever but that brisket... 

I love my brisket. I will spend 10+ hours smoking a brisket to get it perfect. I was very pleased. 

Definitely stop by here for lunch if you're around. It does get busy and the lines do get quite long. If you come with a party of two, the wait shouldn't be that bad. 3+ may take awhile. Be warned!

I left satisfied and with beef and chicken dry rubs. Can't wait to test it with some smoked meat!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I bixi biked our way to Schwartz's just for lunch. I ordered the famous smoked meat sandwich and he got the smoked meat poutine.

Perhaps I'm not a fan of deli meat because I didn't find anything special about this restaurant at all. The meat was tender but overly salty and tasted very average to me. The poutine was huge and the fries were okay. I must say that I do prefer the poutine over the sandwich because there was less meat in the poutine so it was less overwhelming.

I don't think I'll be coming back here the next time I visit Montreal since there are so many other restaurants around the area."}
{"text":"Didn't know much about smoked meat. Upon first bite it reminded of dry corned beef.

Schwartz's is best known for their smoked meat and no visit to Montreal can go escaped without a meal here so I've heard. 

Popped in at 1:30PM and had to wait 15 minutes for a seat on a Wednesday. Two smoked meat sandwiches, a black cherry soda, and an order of poutine came with a pickle (~30).

Had to add more mustard to the sandwich. Wasn't really a fan of the food. The smoked meat just didn't seem worth even the short wait, hype, or even price. Service was friendly and fast. I bet the two guys who sat next to us were pissed we got our food first since we ordered after them. Cash only with the option of \"leaving something extra\" for your server. The menu placement doesn't say anything about price, you have to squint at the sparse menu above the counter to get an idea."}
{"text":"I can't add much to the 911 reviews already posted here... :)

I had read up on the lines at Schwartz's, but was able to walk right in at about 7:30pm on a Tuesday night. The side take-out door was closed, but I was immediately greeted by a super friendly guy, and the employees covering the meat counter had me in and out in less than five minutes. One pound of smoked meat and one loaf of bread set me back about $22 - not bad at all when you consider that it'll make about six normal size sandwiches. 

I got the meat back to our airbnb rental, and got ready to dig in... would it be as good as all the reviews indicated, or is this place overrated? It's as good. It's better. I was wowed. If I lived in or near Montreal, I'd definitely be back. Hmmm... I believe they have shipping options, too. Might have to look into that!"}
{"text":"Schwartz's is a Montreal institution that should require no introduction. I've been eating here since my dad took me as a kid....surely wait staff, shared tables, and some of the best damn smoked meat sandwiches in the world. Classic place and always worth a visit. I'd recommend a medium fat sandwich, fries, pickle and your choice of beverage. Despite not being Jewish owned anymore it hasn't lost any charm or quality and I'm sure the smoked meat will never change."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhhhh yes Schwartz's is it! A must stop for anyone in Montreal. My mouth is just watering thinking about this place. Overcrowded? Yes. Lengendary? Heck yes. Worth it? No hesitations here. I'd wait in the sub zero temperatures of a Montreal winter any day for a smoked meat sandwich.  

Schwartz's defines what a Hebrew Delicatessen is and should be. You will never find any place better."}
{"text":"Was recommended to try this place while in Montreal and it was delicious. It was mid day so we shared a medium fat pastrami sandwich a pickle and cherry coke. Was lovely."}
{"text":"Overall, a big disappointment.  This place suffers from the \"We think we're special\" syndrome.  First of all, extremely rude and pushy staff.  As a life-longer New Yorker, I have to say that no one in NY could get away with an attitude like that.  Canadians are supposed to be polite.  Not only do there counter people try to tell you what to order, but the staff resembles the occupants of Cell Block C, like they learned there manners in prison.

The Smoked meat sandwich is ok.  Does not come  close to Katz's Pastrami in NYC, but must be a good consolation prize for the locals.  For tourists, unless you are from Saskatchewan, skip it."}
{"text":"So of course I had to try this on my recent trip to montreal. I  can safely say this was a good sandwich, the best ever.... Well it was good at best. Now those pickles, I will dream of those. For all you out a towners  you don't have to be shoved in like sardines in the restaurant, order to go in a separate entrance next door."}
{"text":"So very goood!  The smoked meat sandwich, medium fat, w/ dill pickle was awesome.  I think the fattiest one would be even better.  The line was not tooo bad, despite the cold and the interesting people you'll see on that street.  

Price-good.
Food-amazing.
Service-great.
Wait-boooo!

...but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The food was terrible, meat was not fresh, bread was stale. The ambience looked like a mental institution. It also smelled bad. I just don't get why this place is so famous??"}
{"text":"Super small deli. We were lucky to stumble upon this place and find no line. We sat at the bar counter. Service was great and fast. The smoked meat sandwich was nice and seasoned. They give you the option of fatty or lean meat, we opted for fatty meats. The meat pieces were nice and thick. The sandwich may appear small but it is a hefty portion that leaves you feeling full. We also ordered the cole slaw which was a vinegar based cole slaw and pretty tasty. They definitely know what they're doing here, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Note: I am not from Montreal, I have only been here once, so understand that my only qualifications are that a) I'm from New York and b) I love sandwiches.

So, Schwartz's. Not gourmet. Not fancy. You will wait on line to get in, and then you will share a table with strangers. There is a limited menu. It's fine: there are not that many choices to make, because chances are that you want a smoked meat sandwich. It comes on rye with mustard by default. You should also get pickles and cole slaw, and fries if you feel like somehow you're still low on calories.

It's a damn fine sandwich. Eat it. Leave happy. Done."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich really is that good. Make the time to go there. Next time I may try something else on the  menu, but probably not."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich here is recommended by everyone who's visited Montreal.. So made it a mission to visit Schwartz! 

Let me start off by saying that we unluckily arrived on a rainy gloomy day while there was a road closure on the main street due to a street festival. We were not familiar with the area and parking was impossible to find.. After several rounds around the neighbourhood.. We ended up parking at the Pharmaprix beside and grabbed a quick bite. 

The smoked meat was delicious and the staff were very friendly.. It is a seat yourself environment where you will more than likely find yourself sharing a table with a stranger. The place is a tourist attraction and still holds the classic look and feel of the deli shop many decades ago."}
{"text":"When in Montreal, do as the Montrealians. You must visit this monumental landmark. You know a place is good when it's got over a thousand reviews on Yelp and overall it's positive. I came here in a rainy night expecting a line out the door. There was a line alright just not out the door. Thank goodness. Schwartz's has a new line system that is more efficient for guests dining in and take out orders. The place is small so expect a tight seating area.
Don't ask for a menu. It's on the wall just look up. It's about 50 years old of a sign. The only thing to get is a smoked meat sandwich. Tell them your size. I got a medium and that was plenty. The smoked meat is packed in the sandwich with a light spread of mustard. It's so good with mustard and a side of pickles. Don't forget the cherry cola. I ordered a pickle because the fries looked weak and not crispy. I was in and out of there in less than 30 minutes. Now I want another smoked meat sandwich as I'm typing this up."}
{"text":"One of those institutions that you're happy to discover is not overhyped or well past its glory days.  Stick with what Schwartz's does best - smoked meat and kosher pickles - and you won't leave disappointed.  And for goodness sake, at least spring for the medium moist brisket; this is not the time to order lean out of caloric conservatism.  We split a sandwich, a kosher dill (they were out of half sours), and a couple of sodas, and all our expectations were met.  Juicy, flavorful meat as good as any Atwater's or Katz's or [pick your favorite pastrami institution]'s.  I was surprised how soft the rye bread was; the meat is a bit less spiced than American pastrami or corned beef but still flavorful.  Our server was good-natured, funny, and kept things moving.  Plus, I always appreciate it when restaurants can recommend other good food nearby.  We're food tourists, after all!

Schwartz's is worth a stop, no doubt."}
{"text":"Old school!

Reminded me of all the old school delis I have been too in the US.

Street meter parking. Good amount of seating inside but I ordered to go. Packed at 8 pm. Service was decent. Ordering was a bit confusing, no real place to order to go, you just tell the guy at the counter what you want. Pay at the front register. Cash only.

Smoked Meat Sandwich - $9.35 - Meat was so tender and flaky. Great smoke flavor that did not overpower the meat. Levels up to any of the popular US deli spots. For this price, you could only get half a sandwich in US."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the line and worth the hype. Four of us came in not long after eating breakfast and treated this stop as a small snack before leaving town. Despite not being too hungry, we devoured every last bite, wishing we had been able to visit on empty stomachs. The sandwiches were SO good. This was a few months ago and I still haven't stopped dreaming about the tender, juicy, smoky brisket. The cole saw and pickles were also stellar, and our server was funny and friendly. I wish so badly that Montreal was closer so I could eat here weekly."}
{"text":"While their smoked meat is famous, you can achieve the same quality with less wait at a number of other places in town, like the Main across the street or Lester's in Outremont."}
{"text":"This is a great Delhi in a cool section of town.  It's a definite experience.  I got the roasted meat sandwich, which is basically an open face roast beef.  It's dry without adding mustard!  There is a lot of meat for sure.  The poutine is large and you should split it with someone.  Note-the combo plate is really big and should only be eaten if you don't plan to eat again.  Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Good try. 

I had it for take out maybe it is a whole lot better devouring it on the spot. But please note, I walked 5 more steps outside the store front and chewed it all up...

I got the smoked meat, which seemed like it is the bread and butta of this place, and some fries..

The fries are nothing to remember about..

The smoked meat sandwich didn't have the ooOmph of flavor for a smoked meat. It was a tad of the bland side... A couple of my friend added their cole slaw to their sandwich which made it X100100002031083028 times better. It adds another texture and taste to the sandwich. 

It ain't Katz's or Langer's in the sandwich and meat department, but it is a little cheaper (not by much US dollars) but then again the sandwich is smaller in quantity ..."}
{"text":"Very good but very long wait. There's always a line out the door. Definitely an iconic Montreal tourist spot. If you're visiting then its a must have for everyone. If you live in Montreal, chances are you won't be visiting here too often cuz of the lines.

Takeout is a great alternative to eating in"}
{"text":"An institution that we had to visit to see how it stacked up against Langer's and Katz'. 

Smoked meat sandwich hit the spot but it was real close to approaching borderline dry. A lot of flavor and I'm happy we went. Real good fries. 

We split a sando here and went across the street to Main Street Deli which in my opinion had the better of the smoked meat sandwiches.

Needless to say I'd take Langer's or Katz' any day over Schwartz's."}
{"text":"I came here on American Thanksgiving. Had a smoked meat sandwich and switched with my friend for half a turkey sandwich. 

Delish. I am a fan of smoked meats. This place is great but not as good as Mile End in NYC. Lol...the copy of Montreal smoke meat in NYC is better than the original."}
{"text":"Attention, there's a line. It took us almost 20mins to get a table on a sunny Saturday afternoon and the line was quite eye catchy, you will not miss this place when you are driving or striding along St Laurent Blvd. I am a huge fan of pastrami and I was really looking forward to the smoked meat sandwich at Schwartz, please note that pastrami and smoked meat are different. The sandwiches are in right portions and the smoke meat goes really well with mustard. The meat is slightly fatter and juicer than pastrami. We also ordered a side of poutine and it was huge! One funny thing about this restaurant is that you will often find yourself sharing a big table with strangers, doesn't hurt to share some laughs and banter with the dude or girl next to you. Quite an experience."}
{"text":"Ordered two smoked meat sandwiches, poutine, and 1 lb of smoked meat, all to go. Ordered \"medium\" for the meat. I found the poutine just okay, but the smoked meat was just delicious! Definitely worth the stop. The takeout counter is actually a separate entrance and separate storefront than the diner, just next door. Friendly service - will come again."}
{"text":"The famous Schwartz's definitely doesn't disappoint. Line out the door even at the most obscure eating times. Montreal smoked meat, I've never had anything like the stuff at this place."}
{"text":"Yes, I know it's a Montréal institution, and yes, I know you just have to try out some places because you just have to try out some places, but I just didn't get the hype that surrounds Schwartz's and their 'viande fumée'.

I got the smoked meat sandwich (medium fat), and it really didn't have much flavor, other than just tasting like a pile of meat. While tender, there was no real spice or seasoning coming through, and the smoking process interestingly didn't really enhance the flavor of the meat. The rye is good but doesn't really hold up to the meat, with the sandwich falling apart once you get about half-way through. The fries are an afterthought for the kitchen, lukewarm and more limp than crisp - don't bother.

What *is* impressive is how quickly they can turn customers here - I was seated at the counter and was in and out in less than 15 minutes, a veritable turnstile. Based on my own experience, my guess is that Schwartz's is resting on its laurels a bit, knowing that the tourists will be coming by given its long history. IMHO, the delis in New York have nothing to worry about."}
{"text":"My fav smoke meat and steak place small but cozy love the plate with everything in it.Would recommend it."}
{"text":"a definite must when in Montreal.  Everyone that I spoke to about what to do in Montreal said that I could not leave town eating here.  The smoked meat was magnificent!  There was a line for tables outside but if you're doing take out you can walk right inside and order.  I did take away and to ensure that my sandwich wasn't going to be soggy so I decided on getting the meat and with bread and make my own sandwiches when it was time to eat.  Wow!  It was difficult to not dive into it while I was driving back to my hotel.  The pickles were crunchy with just the right saltiness.  This is an absolute must!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what the hype is about this place. Just about everyone I discussed eating options with in Montreal told me to check this place out, unfortunately I was underwhelmed. As expected there was a long line when we arrived around 3pm. It appears they play favorites to known patrons as parties with the same number of individuals that were way behind us in line were seated before we were. The service or lack thereof was definitely horrible. 

When we were finally seated, no one took our orders for fifteen minutes as we watched them serve those that were seated after us. Under normal circumstances we would have left but given the sacrifice we made waiting in line in the rain and the hype that led to the visit, we had to experience this \"delicacy\". When someone in our party decided to call a server's attention to the delay in taking our orders, he barked at us in French even though he had spoken to everyone else in perfectly fine English. I had never experienced anything like that before. It was rude, obnoxious and very unprofessional. 

Now to add salt to the wound, my sandwich was AWFUL. It was served with a whole pickle, some fries and a can of soda. The mustard coated thin bread slices were almost non-existent for the amount of salty smoked meat served. To me, a street served pastrami sandwich in New York is waaaay better. It was just A LOT OF SALTY MEAT. No one should consume that amount of sodium in a seating!

All I can say is we got to to experience this tourist trap and not only was it overpriced for the quality, it was also such a waste of time for subpar food. This is a place to visit at 3am when you are completely sht-faced and need just about anything to soak up all that alcohol."}
{"text":"A must visit smoked meat joint in Montreal - definitely encompasses the fast food of Montreal. Central locations with great eats, a legend in the city! The only downfall is that sometimes there's a line"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD - I'm not a meat person but my God this stuff is gold. 

TIP: there is a HUGE line for Schwartz's almost anytime you go, but if you go to the Schwartz's right next door (seat yourself at the bar stools) there's rarely a line and it's the same AMAZING food. 

Seriously a must stop in Montreal, I thought the place would be overrated because of all the hype but it was 100% the best sandwich I've ever had."}
{"text":"If I had to choose my last meal on earth - I think this would be close to the finish line.

This meat is just to die for.
Everytime I'm in Montreal I get a pound to go.
I will admit I think they are getting alittle pricy now - but it's worth that treat when I end up the odd time in Montreal. 

Goes very well with their massive pickles and cherry cola. 

There is always a line outside this place but I think it goes quick because they sit you where they can.  The last time I ended up at the bar and chatting to the friendly gent that served me. 

Service is fast and friendly.

AN ABSOLUTE MUST if you are in Montreal .. you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"$9 for delicious smoked meat piled onto 2 small pieces of bread + 2.50 for a black cherry soda. Delicious. 

The hype almost lives up. Every person visiting Montreal needs to visit this place once. But would I return? Probably not. 

The owner is super nice and makes everyone feel welcomed. We went for Dinner and the wait was only 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I was told it is the best smoked meat in Montreal. Well, it may be the best smoked meat I've ever had. I got there just after midnight, and was told they are serving to-go orders only. Also, there was only one thing on the menu: smoked meat sandwich. Their boards showed turkey and duck, so... maybe they were just out of those? Anyway, my sandwich. Pricey  ($11.05 CAD). #worthit It looked like red brisket, and tasted amazing. Let this be a lesson, all you barbecuers: never challenge an old Jew to smoked meat (you will lose). This food is incredible. Go buy some. Now."}
{"text":"Stood in line for over 30 minutes in 10 degree weather. They sit you next to strangers when you are finally allowed in. The smoked meat was sliced thin and was very fatty. Also ordered a turkey sandwich hoping it was like Katz in NYC where it's made there at the restaurant and is delicious. It was sliced deli meat and didn't have mayo. Glad we tried the place but don't ever have a reason to go back. I don't see how people can say this place is better than Katz's."}
{"text":"I'm from California and we don't eat this on a regular basis so I was happy to splurge a bit. The meat didn't have much flavor for being smoked, but with plenty of mustard it was delish. The  meat pretty much melts in your mouth. Side of pickles, fries, and cherry coke will fulfill your daily calorie requirement."}
{"text":"Service was great but the sandwiches they are known for are totally overrated. I saw this place on TV and thought I'd travel to Montreal to give it a try. I was pretty disappointed after a six hour drive from Toronto, a 2 mile uphill walk in the rain from old Montreal, and having to squeeze in the tiny restaurant to have a dry sandwich. I'm fortunate to have a better Reuben sandwich closer to home."}
{"text":"Sit down at one of the tables with strangers for a juicy brisket sandwich. The meat is marinaded and slowly smoked to perfection! The french fries are home made, drink a cherry coke and you will not be disappointed. There may be a line outside the restaurant, proof of how good it is!"}
{"text":"There's only so many places still around like this, and they should be treasured.
Sure it's crowded, and you may need to share a table with strangers like I did. And sure it's touristy and there is a line all the time... But it's an institution that has been around a long time and will hopefully be for a many years more.

The food is good, and the prices are reasonable. When it comes to the smoked meat sandwich you have a choice between lean or regular with more fat. If you want it to be moister don't go with the lean but either I'm sure tastes great. When I was there we got a fries to share, and also a pickle to share which I think was a good call. The pickles are big and the fries are enough for two people to share. The other big thing there is to get a cherry soda. So do yourself a favour and get a smoked meat sandwich, some fries and ketchup, some pickle and a cherry soda and you'll be good to go"}
{"text":"An iconic visit is a must have to this old school Deli counter. Dress up to get dirty! Don't even look at the menu! 
                     Smoked meat, fries, a pickle and cherry coke. 
The seats at the back of the house is where many Politicians, hockey players and Celebrities sat to eat.  
Tip? Avoid the line up go near closing 11 pm-12"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to never wait in line. If you're ok with sitting at a table with strangers up close and personal in a super hot and small resto, this is the place for you. The food is delish! The smoked meat is fantastic as are the pickles. Mmmmmm can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Came here for the smoked meat, got the sand which and fries from the take out section. Overall was very good! Be prepared for very long lines for dine in."}
{"text":"I will have to agree that this is indeed one of the world's great sandwiches. I tried it for the first time today and I couldn't get enough after just one visit. The meat is succulent, and is not over salted, which in my opinion makes it better than pastrami. I will be stopping by again tomorrow on my way out of town to get another \"fix\" before I head back to TO.

The fact that they refuse to franchise and expand or open other locations is really to their credit. That way they keep the quality high and authentic. It has become the \"must-visit\" gastronomic treat for me in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first when I was told about eating at Schwartz's. There was a small line outside, so I decided maybe this place isn't as bad as I thought. The inside was set up as a cafeteria and it was very crowded. You also share tables with others. Then, we ordered our food. The smoked meat was put on a large plate for the three of us to share. They also gave us bread. The smoked meat was delicious and fared priced. Overall, it was good."}
{"text":"For me personally when a restaurant becomes the Mecca of its own category, it loses its appeal. Is it good because everyone says it's good? Or is it really that good?

Economy A: Schwartz's.

I sat at the counter and asked for \"whatever the locals order\", minus the bread, and got the \"open face\" sandwich, aka a plate of pastrami. Warm, juicy, delicious, and not too salty at all. 

Was it good enough? Definitely. Good enough to warrant its reputation? No. I think their secret ingredient is nostalgia. Add a pinch of that and suddenly everything becomes magic."}
{"text":"That smoked meat man! Great food comes out of Montreal and this place is servin' it. We went late night, and ordered takeout. Cool, friendly staff, and quick, prompt service. The sandwiches were delicious. That much meat on that tiny bread? That's a problem I'll live with. If I only were home and had some white rice and some kimchi with the meat? Damn. Mindblowing. Pass on the poutine. And the pickles were aiiiiite. But the sandwich doe. Really doe. Thank you, Schwartz gang."}
{"text":"If you're a foodie and find yourself in Montreal, make sure you find yourself at Schwartz's.

The line for sit down is long, but the line for take out is short and since it's all about the food, that's what you'll do! 

I got a smoked meat sandwich and the smoked meat poutine. Wow, is that meat delicious! The sandwich competes with anything you'd get at a NY deli. That's a huge compliment from a snob like me. And the poutine OMG the poutine, this thing is an attack of yummy. I live in Wisconsin and certify that those cheese curds are as fresh and squeaky as they come. Combined that with meat, fries and gravy and you have yourself a bowl of heaven!"}
{"text":"Seeing a line outside a restaurant year round is usually a good sign, and in this case, it certainly is!

A mound of lean, regular or fatty (artery clogging) served on seemingly tiny slices of bread with mustard, this smoked meat sandwich is to die for!  I would eat here regularly if it wouldn't plug my arteries.  The balance of flavors for the meat, mustard, and rye bread is great and will certainly fill you up!

The wait can be daunting sometimes, but it's certainly worth giving it a try!"}
{"text":"It was the first time my wife and I visited Montreal and we heard that we had to hit Schwartz's Deli. It was a hot and humid day in the city and I just walked up a good sized hill, so I was a sweaty mess. We figured the place with about 10 people waiting outside the door was our place.

We got in and I was surprised at how small it was. There were about 40 seats and the table next to you is about a foot and a half away. I could tell the 2 15 year old girls next to me were not happy too happy to have a 220 pound mess eating next to them. Believe me, I wasn't happy either. I should have taken the metro.

I ordered the lean smoked beef, it looks a lot like a corn beef sandwich that comes on Rye bread with a little bit of mustard. My wife got half a loaf of bread and was very happy. It was actually quite a lot of food for her. I would have liked a little more mustard, which I added about halfway through.

The sandwich wasn't overwhelmingly large like Katz', it was actually lunch sandwich size, maybe a little large.

Also, it was only 7 bucks. Perfect amount for what you got. Very fair. Plus they took American money. Happy time!

I should have got the medium fat, because the lean as super lean, if I would come here more than once I would have lean, but  I would have liked  a little more flavor.

Our waiter was awesome, got us in and out of there, refilled the water often. Overall, a great first lunch in Montreal!"}
{"text":"A tourist trap that rests on their past reputation. Place just feels dirty. As a Montrealer The Main across the street is the place to go"}
{"text":"People say this is the Katz of montreal but I disagree. Schwartz smoked meat sandwich was drier and crumbly. I would have liked it more if it had more moisture in it. I loved the pickles but $1.25 more for a pickle on the side? But a bite of the pickle and a bite of the sandwich was the perfect combination. 

There is always a line for sit in but I say just go next door for takeout. The line goes much faster."}
{"text":"The queue to sit down was not moving after more than 15 minutes so I ended up getting the smoked meat sandwich from the take out counter next door. They insist on cash below $12 otherwise you can use your card. The sandwich was pretty much bread, meat and mustard. It was very good, the meat was moist, tasty and with the right amount of saltiness."}
{"text":"*Schwartz's has become a Montreal's famous landmark for just one dish: Smoked Meat. 
*Locals now to go other shops to get their smoked meat fix so this place has now became a tourist spot. 
*looks like portion has gotten smaller over the years. 

-Smoked meat sandwich (Medium Fat) - $9.35:
One serving had at least 2 pounds of thick cut smoked meat and you can order your meat from lean to extra fat. 
I honestly didn't care for the rye bread as it was quite dry but the smoked meat ... YUM! Since I ordered the meat medium, I got some of the buttery fat that literally melted in my mouth. That little zing from the mustard complimented perfectly with the fatty meat, but I wished there was more! Though I didn't order any drink or sides, I heard the \"supposed\" smoked meat combo must also include a cherry coke soda and pickle so you guys should definitely order that!"}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME! Such an authentic deli with friendly staff. The smoked meat sandwich and French fries were so delicious. The pickle was the best pickle I've ever eaten. Really small inside so we had to wait a little while but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after a hockey game at McGill university. This place did not disappoint. We had two smoked sandwiches that where more than two people can eat plus there cole slaw and dill pickle. Schwartz's deli is definitely a landmark of Montreal."}
{"text":"We couldn't determine from reviews if we should try Schwartz's or if it was just a tourist trap.  It was great!  

We didn't have to put our name in for seating.  An employee just pops his head out and calls out for different numbers in party.  Our wait to be seated for a party of five was not very long. 

Sitting at communal tables added to the experience.  Our family met a family from Ontario who were also visiting the city on their spring break.

We loved the character & unchanged history of the place.  The server was not smilely, but efficient and unfriendly.  The smoked meat sandwich (we got medium), the pickle, the cole slaw and especially the fries were all amazing!"}
{"text":"The wait is worth the sand which. Corned beef crossed with Texas brisket on rye bread......ridiculous! Get the pickle and we went with sweet pepper.....man on man we need to keep supporting g traditional joints like this. We split a sand which and got one to go."}
{"text":"This is the best deli in Montreal the pickles are great the peppers are fantastic and the sandwich (which by the way has the best smoked meat I've ever had) is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"It seems like this is just a mandatory visit if you go to Montreal. The place is relatively famous thanks to the many food shows that have featured it so we figured why not!
There is a gritty, New York vibe to the place, a no nonsense mixed with a friendly atmosphere. The menu is straight forward, so you can't mess that up. The staff is patient and kind, and sitting family style is just a necessity as the very small dining area is usually packed.
All that said, my take away is that this place is frankly a lot of hype at the end of the day. The sandwich looks packed with smoked meat (Montreal's contribution to cured meats) but if you look carefully, it is mostly an optical illusion as the bread is seriously small. Whatever. The meat is delicious, and I would have wanted more fat but my waiter didn't give me that option. After I ordered I heard another guy ask for it and I was like, dang! So if you go, make sure to ask for the fatty cut for more flavor. If you are counting calories, what the hell are you doing here anyway?! The fries are a definite meh, and the pickle tasted weird. We noticed this at a few places in Montreal, so maybe it's a local thing, but their pickles have an odd aftertaste of sweet that fades into a cheap vinegar, like white vinegar flavor. I am used to hearty garlic German pickles, so maybe that's my problem, but I couldn't even finish it as it tasted of urine (sorry!)
If you go, have fun, but realize you are just doing the tourist thing. We had fantastic smoked meats during our stay, but Schulz's wasn't one of them."}
{"text":"Smoked meats galore (aka pastrami). Best known in Montreal for their sandwiches and meat. Luckily, when my boyfriend and I arrived to this location for dinner the line was short and we were seated within less than 10 mintues. Just so you know, after we were done, around 8:30ish the line stretched across 3-4 stores. 

I like how Schwartz's had different levels of meats - lean, medium, or fatty. I had the medium and my boyfriend had the fatty. The fatty was definitely the better pick since the smoked meat can get a bit dry in certain areas, the fat can really counteract the dry bread. 

I truly like this place, good sandwiches and good service really makes a difference. The waiters made an effort to speak to us since they noticed we weren't natives. What a night."}
{"text":"WARNING: OVERRATED 

This is the kind of place where people go just because it is popular and then when they actually try it, they feel like they HAVE to say they like it.

Smoked meat can be very flavourful if it's prepared properly. The meat at this place is so dry as if it's left in the middle of a desert and dried until the last drop moist and soul are completely destroyed. Then there's a layer of mustard. That's what you taste: Mustard and bland dry meat. Get water ready unless you want to choke to death. Grocery store meat sandwiches are far better.

Service is -100 stars. I don't know if this is a French arrogance thing or Schwartz's own inflated ego. I walked into an empty store relatively early in the morning and it took like 5 minutes to get anyone to acknowledge me while the employees were busy talking to each other, and even then I had to ask for someone to get service. Then I was unpleasantly tossed to a \"to go\" cash register. 

Sadly, they know that their business will continue to be successful without quality control."}
{"text":"There's a reason there's always a line in front of Schwartz's, it's because it's freaking amazing! The line is part of the experience, it's like you're going into a ride, a culinary ride.

Forget New York Pastrami, forget Lester's, forget you had to pick up the children at school, this is the only smoked meat you ever need to eat!

Service is more than good, it's fun, which is exactly what you want when going to this kind of place.

Better get a pickle!

This is Montreal at it's best! 

The reason I gave four stars instead of five is: \"Calm your horses, it's only smoked meat!\""}
{"text":"Do not believe the reviews. This smoked meat sandwich is a pile of bad tasting corned beef on a poor quality hot dog bun type of bread. Over rated is an understatement.  The takeout area is not clean, particularly the bathroom.  Plenty of good restaurants in this area so \" walk on by\"."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich is awesome!!! So much meat and so delicious! The line was long, so took the sandwiches Togo. Beer and smoked meat make a good marriage :)"}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwiches lived up to the hype! Delicious sandwich that is basically like a smoked version of corned beef, but the smoke adds plenty of flavor. I got it medium for my heart, but my cousins got fatty which they said was super rich and tasty. Loved the smoked meat taste, and paired it with poutine to make it really Canadian. Wish they had smoked meat sandwiches back home, Schwartz's makes me have to fly to Montreal to get it, but I'm not complaining there."}
{"text":"There was still a line at 3:30p on a weekday but was seated in 15 mins with just 2 of us. It is quicker to sit with just 1-2 people in your party.
Split the following for 2:
Smoked meat sandwich- the slices of beef had just the right lean and fatty parts. Good flavor.
1/2 sour pickle- hubby liked it but I prefer a regular pickle.
Fries- meh. These were not as crunchy as I'd like them
Cherry coke-not sure what the hype is as it tastes like Coca-Cola cherry coke. But it went well w the meal."}
{"text":"Bottom line, it was a yummy sandwich but soured by subpar service. 

As recommended by a billion blogs and travel sites, we got a smoked meat sandwich. Since there was a massive line snaking out from the sit-in restaurant, we decided to grab the sandwich to-go from their deli next door instead, where the line was only about 10 people long.

The smoked meat was definitely melt-in-your mouth, juicy and full of flavor, but the indifferent service left a bad taste in our mouths. It was dinner time, and the guys behind the counter were evidently \"over\" the steady stream of tourists, and the lady ringing us up at the cash register acted like she was doing us a favor. Jeez, sorry I'm wasting your time??

Dang, it genuinely bummed me out that I didn't enjoy Schwartz's. I can say I've tried it once, but I doubt I'll be back again in the future."}
{"text":"The line for lunch was relatively long but it was worth the wait. This small deli serves up tasty smoked meat sandwiches. 

I really enjoyed the black cherry cola too. Definitely worth another visit the next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Cash only, but they take USD & CAD. This is located in a great area, very easy to get to. The service was fast and friendly, though we came at around 3pm. The space is small so I could see there being a long wait for seating. 

We were given the option of lean, medium, or fatty smoked meat. We chose medium, which came with a slather of yellow mustard on one side. We also got coleslaw and fries. I wouldn't get the fries again because they were soggy and a but oily. The coleslaw was great and very acidic--vinegar based instead of mayo based. The sandwich was small but very filling. Yum!"}
{"text":"Iconic and delicious.
It lives up to the hype.
Just beware of long lineups. Much better to order takeout."}
{"text":"Based on my recent visit I have to say Schwartz has good but overrated smoked meat. 

Numerous delis, sandwich shops and restaurants in NYC (and I'm sure elsewhere) serve tastier pastrami and corned beef sandwiches. 
The more famous shops charge close to $20 U. S. a sandwich while Schwartz only charges around $10 Canadian though the sandwich at Schwartz is quite a bit smaller. 

The smoked meat at Schwartz is quite lean and the seasoning is a bit bare bones.  It is not bad but I wouldn't drive out of my way during a visit to Montreal for a smoked meat sandwich from here. 

On the other hand the smoked meat poutine was very tasty with a delicious gravy, fries and cheese providing moisture to compliment the lean bits of smoked meat. I felt it was a lot more worth the close to $10 price tag it shares with the smoked meat sandwich.
This is something the shops back in NYC definitely don't provide. I love Montréal!"}
{"text":"Before, I went to Montreal, my co-worker asked me if I was planning on staying on my \"silly diet\" while I was on vacation, and he sternly informed me that, if I did, I would be missing out on the best pastrami sandwich I had ever tasted.  The funny thing is, that even though he never got around to giving me the name of the place before I left, I somehow knew immediately when I randomly happened upon it that this was probably the place he was talking about.  It was confirmed when I bit into the delicious, tender smoked meat.  I sent him a one word email that night:  \"Schwartz's?\"

\"Yes!!\" He replied, \"you found it!!\""}
{"text":"This place is NOT a tourist trap. 

Get the smoked meat sandwich w medium fat. I was told that the full fat one can be overwhelming and the no fat one can be dry. This was amazing. Just amazing. Life changing as a matter of fact. My. Life. Was. Changed. 

Fries - best fries of my life. Idk how the fries are so creamy..it blew my mind. 

Get the pickle. Finish off with the black cherry soda. 

On top of that. The guy that helped us was sooo friendly. Why is everyone in Montreal so nice? Must be a Canadian thing? 

This place is packed. I saw big groups there so they can accommodate it...it just might take a sec. and the turnaround is high so the wait isn't too long. 

Life changing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in all of Canada. They've been in the news lately with reports that the restaurant is for sale. If this is the case, I earnestly hope it remains in Canadian hands!

Having said that, I can add that the cozy atmosphere and wonderful aroma of smoked meat only adds to the appetite. Enjoy a smoked meet sandwich with French fries a cherry Coke, and save your diet for tomorrow! Schwartz's is an experience not to be missed."}
{"text":"I have lived vicariously long enough through the reviews that have been posted on Yelp about how delicious the meat from Schwartz was. Finally had time to visit Montreal, there was no chance I'd miss going to Schwartz's. Arrived on one of the coldest days to Montreal. The wait was about 10-15mins for 4 couples ahead of me. It was blistering cold outside, my hands and feet were numb from the cold weather. Finally got to the door and as the door opened a gust of the smoked and boiled meat smacked me in the face. At that moment, I knew I was in food heaven. 

Sat quickly by the bar. Ordered a medium smoked meat sandwich and their poutine. Food arrived extremely quickly. One bite into the smoked meat and I knew my life was complete. Meat fell apart upon the bite and melted on my tongue. Slide down my throat effortlessly. I never liked mustard but the mustard was perfect for the sandwich. Bite after bite I soon realized I was eating my fingers. Poutine wasn't worth mentioning. Went next door to the takeout to grab an extra pound of meat just because I couldn't get enough of it."}
{"text":"This place is overhyped. 

The service is awful. Order a dill pickle & get a sour. Order turkey and get smoked meat. Basically you are given whatever the server is in the mood to give you. 

And the smoked meat is rather bland. Perhaps I am spoiled coming from NY and being surrounded by some of the best delis in the world but my personal opinion is that the meat at Schwartz is mediocre at best. Not worth the wait or hassle."}
{"text":"When I want a famous smoked meat sandwich in Montreal, I think Schwartz's.  However, you are paying for more than what you get-- you need to take out a mortgage for a few sandwiches and drinks at this place.  Smoking the wallet and the meat.  If they did those sandwiches up like they do at the Carnegie Deli in Manhattan (R.I.P) then I can understand....but....where is the beef?...

BTW, get a new coffee machine fellas..."}
{"text":"Schwartz's smoked meat is pretty amazing. Tender, juicy, and very delicious. Like most people, you don't go here for the ambiance or anything else except for their smoked meat. 

The wait was only 15-20 min so that wasn't too bad, however, standing in line all you can smell is trash and funk, not the best pre-game environment.

The service was fast, friendly, and good. You might be squished with other people if you're a small party because of the lack of seating available. 

Overall, it was worth it"}
{"text":"I love Katz Delicatessen in NYC. So I was a little weary about how this would compare. 

It did not disappoint! 
My sister and I went when there was a power outage but that was fine because it wasn't as crowded. We order the smoked meat sandwich with a cherry coke because that's what Anthony Bourdain ordered. 

It was delicious! Katz and Schwartz are different but I wouldn't be mad about grabbing some Schwartz! The meat was soft and tender, the mustard was subtle, and the bread was phenomenal. The cherry coke was tasty as well. 

The menu is kind of confusing so if you are like me and don't know what the heck you are doing, just grab a seat and wait for a waiter to come by and take your order."}
{"text":"This is Montreal's equivalent of a New York deli, attitude and all.  Always busy, so expect a wait, but the line moves fast. You can order what you want, but almost everyone is talked into #3, the smoked meat sandwich (basically corned beef).  Piled high and very tasty, you have a choice of lean, medium or on the fatty side (About $8. Canadian). We ordered cole slaw as well which was also good, and the waiter talked us into a veggie which is how he described their pickles. Owned by singer Celine Dion and her husband, this is a very very casual place. We found it a fun experience."}
{"text":"It exceeded the hype for me.  The smoked meat and the pickle were so good and so good together.  This is one tourist trap that can trap me anytime."}
{"text":"Quand une adresse est aussi populaire il m'arrive d'être méfiant, genre : c'est trop beau pour être vrai

Un essai a suffit pour me conquérir, je pense qu'il y a assez d'avis. Vous avez envie d'un sandwich à la viande fumée, ne cherchez plus. Avec un énorme cornichon à partager, pour le fun.

Alors oui, c'est pas gastronomique, mais on n'est pas là pour ça.

Ils font un classique, et ils le font bien, très bien. Enough said."}
{"text":"Really good smoked meat. 
Didn't realize there was two lines. One for sit down and one to go. We unfortunately made the mistake of the sitdown but quickly found out there was another line to go.
Line outside is to sit and the line inside (the left door when looking at shop) is to go.

The to go line went real quick. There was also some seating in the back which was real nice.

Smoked meat sandwich comes with mustard. 

If in Montreal, worth a visit for their famous smoked meat."}
{"text":"I've heard lots about Schwartz's from friends who have visited Montreal and truthfully I thought it would be overhyped, but it wasn't! Their famous Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich was delicious. Their service was also really fast and we got our sandwiches in no time. The only thing that I wish I knew ahead of time was that their pickles were a little over $2 each.. although it was delicious, I'm not sure if it was worth paying over $2 for it. 

Also, a good thing to know ahead of time is that they don't accept credit cards, so be sure to have some cash ahead of time, if not, there is an ATM machine inside."}
{"text":"While I'm not sure that \"Yay! I'm a fan\" encapsulates my feelings about Schwartz's, that's where we'll leave it.  \"Famous\" places like this are usually vastly disappointing.  But a sandwich of pretty high quality can be had for $5.50 CDN.  The pickles are pretty decent.  The fries aren't great.  And you'll probably be treated to a progression of baffling American tourists.  

On my visit, I sat next to a well-proportioned girl who was dining with a an ultra-heavy man for whom sandwich cramming apeared an exertive, aerobic activity.  Not satisifed with the (generous) dimensions of his sandwich, he also found time to consume half a loaf of rye bread, three 1/2 sour pickles, his lady friend's french fries and two 7 Ups.  While his friend/lover paid, he fanned himself for several seconds before working up the wherewithal to descend from his stool."}
{"text":"Great sandwich piled high with juicy meat. Good bread too. The service is fast and the joint is hopping! Chow down, they move you thru quickly."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is Montreal's world famous Hebrew deli. It is famed for it's smoked meat, which happens to be the BEST sandwich in the entire world.

Smoked meat is found throughout Montreal but Schwartz's has that certain \"je ne sais quoi\" special touch.

History shows that it has stayed in the same, unchanged for EIGHTY years! There is always a lineup, no matter the time of day, or day of the week. The wait has not usually long in my experience.  I have been fortunate on several occasions of getting a seat even from the back of the line, simply because there was space available to accommodate my group of two. 

Be prepared to share a table with strangers. I can testify that in my many visits,  I have never had unpleasant table buddies.

Montreal smoked meat is synonymous with Montreal.  You really cannot state that you have been to Montreal without trying Schwartz's smoked meat! 

Big chunks of salty meat, smoked over charcoals on rye bread = beyond delicious. This really is one of those places that has become a legend for a reason."}
{"text":"Some places are iconic for a reason. You'll know where you're at when you get there because of the line outside. Got there around 2pm and there was still a line. But the line goes by pretty fast. Given the relatively small menu, people generally just eat and get out. Theres a guy who seats you, and generally you have to wait outside until they call you in. Theres a take out place next door if you want to take your sandwich to go. 

Smoked meat sandwich here is amazing. Got medium fatty and it was very very tasty. I was super satisfied and thought about getting more....even right now as i am writing this review."}
{"text":"An excellent little deli in Montreal, with the best smoked meat sandwich I have ever had. 

The restaurant truly deserves the name hole in the wall, being a long tube with a preparation area on one side and a side of basic tables that you, if you don't have enough friends, usually get to share with some strangers during the busy hours.

The smoked meat sandwich is excellent, with just the right amount of spice and flavor from the seasoning, and the side choices make it a perfect inexpensive meal in a city that can get heavy on the wallet or expense account. 

They will also sell you the spices you need for beef, chicken, and fries, so you can take the experience with you when you leave Montreal. Just make sure to take enough, since it's excellent on steak and goes quick."}
{"text":"OVERRATED is the BEST word to describe shwartz's!!!! If you want to wait an hour in the cold outside on the streets for a smoke meat sandwich that taste bland and unappealing you can but if you're looking for a better joint for smoke meat sandwiches there are so many better places. Montreal is the Mecca of smoke meat sandwiches! Reuben's on st-catherine's is one of the best places to get smoke meat !! Or if you're in laval : George's is also amazing. Ok back to shwartz's .. it's overrated for many reasons 1st: the service is a mess... they really don't give a shit about customer service. They treat you like garbage. They just want you out the door. There's hardly any seats and your squished to eat your meal with people who look greasy. Your appetite is practically gone when you look at who's eating there. 

2) the only reason they are so packed and famous is for the tv shows and the fact that Celine Dion is associated with them.

3) the smoke meat is really gross and rubbery! 

Overall, avoid thinking its good smoke meat.. there's : The main accross the street that offers way better service and way better smoke meat 
You're welcome :)"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Save your time an patience and buy from the store next to it!  Who really needs to sit down and eat anyway?"}
{"text":"I was determined to eat a sandwich from here so I went when it opened hoping to grab a sandwich to go so we could eat for lunch. Was dismayed to find they don't sell sandwiches that early. But I could buy lbs of meat to go, so I asked for 2 lbs not realizing that's a LOT of meat. Drove that meat all the way back to Queens, NY and made Reuben sandwiches straightaway. Probably not the same as theirs but amazing nonetheless and definitely worth the CAD$~30 I paid for it."}
{"text":"I like Schwartz's, despite the long lines and rude service. Sure, people will tell you to eat at The Main (which is good in its own right), but the smoked meat isn't quite as good as Schwartz's..."}
{"text":"Yup. Love Schwartz's smoked meat.  It's so tender and oh so flavorful, and I'm pretty sure my friend got us the lean stuff.  FWIW - I usually dislike lean brisket.

We ate the smoked meat with plain mustard.  My friend got their fries - which I didn't really care for.  I only cared about the smoked meat. It was really yummy. I can eat pounds of this stuff.  And yes, I have eaten my fair share of pastrami and corned beef in authentic Jewish delis in Mahattan.   I also love me a good reuben...  I mean I know it's not exactly pastrami or corned beef, but I can definitely say I prefer Schwartz's smoked meat to anything I've ever gotten in a Jewish deli in Manhattan, but perhaps I need to do another taste test."}
{"text":"After dining here, my personal feeling is that this place benefited greatly from celebrity word of mouth and its reputation over the years as a smoked meat mecca.

But is it a culinary revelation that puts famous Jewish deli stalwarts like Katz's in NYC to shame?  Absolutely not.

I made a point of dining in the restaurant and got here at 10:30am on a weekday to ensure I don't get engulfed by the long lines.  Fortunately the restaurant was barely half full when I got in.  I sat down and made sure I had the full experience in hand.  I ordered their famous smoked meat sandwich and paired it with a plate of poutine and cole slaw.

The sandwich was fine.  To be honest, their meat felt a little dry, even thought it was still flavorful and a solid sandwich as a whole.  The poutine was also ok.  It wasn't the best poutine I had in Montreal by a stretch but it was still tasty and a pure artery-clogging experience.  The cole slaw was just average IMO.

Generally speaking if it wasn't for all the hype around this place, I would probably have more reasonable expectations.  But even if I strip out all of my preconceived notions, frankly speaking I still think a good smoked meat sandwich from Katz's or even Carnegie Deli (or even Junior's) in NYC is still a cut above simply because their meat is juicier and more flavorful.  

But all in all, it's still not a bad place to grab a nice deli sandwich.  I just don't think I'd ever wait an hour in line for this."}
{"text":"The best smoked meat in Montreal. Period.
Got a sandwich with toasted rye bread to go and it was great!! It was tender and flavorful with enough grease to help with my hang over."}
{"text":"Better than Katz, Carnegie, or 2nd Ave. Deli in NYC. I think about Schwartz's Deli at least once a week, and i'm looking forward to my trip next month. Best smoked meat i've ever had. I finished a plate of lean and non-lean all by my lonesome. The results? Meat-sweats. The good kind."}
{"text":"So made it to the famous shop. Had the sandwich which is stacked with meat. Taste wise it is good tho I have to give the edge to Rosemary n Rocksalt (due to herbs) Schwartz meat also has a tougher cured texture while others might more tender.

Oh and did I mention the line up?"}
{"text":"The line? Insane.
The sandwich? Insanely good.

Went to the to-go counter after seeing a line 20+ long for the restaurant during an off lunch hour.

Not many choices, because you don't need them. Get the smoked meat sandwich, simple, delicious, super good. Fries are the same everywhere you go in Montreal, poutine style."}
{"text":"Have to pop into Schwartz's for a proper Montreal smoked meat whenever I'm in town. And it wouldn't be right without a cott black cherry and pickles and clone slaw. Classic sandwich that can only be had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Their smoked meats are the best in Montreal, hands down. You must come here if you are visiting. If you live in Montreal, you should be going to Schwart'z at least twice per week. If I lived in Montreal I would be their number 1 costumer."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is the oldest deli in Canada, dating back since 1928.Just walking through the door is a blast from the past, with its old school deli stool counter, and tables packed back to back, walls plastered with photographs, awards, and featured magazines. Even the waitstaff have the old deli hats.

Let alone, the pastrami sandwich ($5.90) is fantastic. The pastrami is steamed and smoked enough so that the meat breaks down and falls apart in your mouth upon biting into it. The meat is thrown between two pieces of light rye bread  and a light coating of yellow mustard. However, for those mustard pastrami mustard fiends like myself, there are bottles available on each table allowing you to liberally slather on as much mustard to your liking. It is leaps and bounds above many people's expectations. Don't forget to add a dill pickle ($1.60) to add some much needed crunchy texture, and a Cott Cerise Noire ($1.80), a yummy cherry soda, to swallow it all down. If you're really hungry, a small plate of fresh homemade french fries ($2.65), crispy on the outside and potatoey on the inside.

But Schwartz's has been a long-time contender to the famous Katz's Deli in New York City and I couldn't help but to compare the two (they even had a Maxim article comparing the two just above where I was sitting, see photo). This is not your classic Pastrami on Rye that you are accustomed to seeing in New York City. There are subtle differences: from the lighter and softer rye bread compared to the heavier and thicker version sold at Katz's and delis throughout America, simple and sub-standard yellow mustard is used as compared to the more savory deli/spicy brown mustard, to the pastrami, and the portions are smaller. The flavors in the pastrami are not as deep and smoky, holding a bit of the flavor from its corned beef brethren. But there is one thing that Schwartz's reigns supreme, the price!! For the price of a Pastrami Sandwich ($5.60), Cott Soft Drink ($1.80), Dill Pickle ($1.60), and French Fries ($2.65), it still blows the price of a $14.95 Pastrami Sandwich at Katz's Deli. Sometimes price can make all the difference in the taste of food and that just might do it for me.

And another sidenote: Get there well BEFORE 12pm. Luckily we arrived at Schwartz's at 11:45 AM on New Year's Day when there were still a decent amount of tables empty. But as we ate, the place was fully packed, with strangers squished together and sharing tables. There was no seat unoccupied. By the time we left, there was a long line extending out the door and 2-3 storefronts down."}
{"text":"Schwartz's lives up to the hype! In fact, you won't miss this place if you're passing by because there's always a huge line! 

The location is perfect, as it's nestled on one of Montreal's most lively streets (and was a stone's throw from my Airbnb). 

I had the classic - a Montreal smoked meat sandwich with a pickle on the side. The meat was succulent and delicious, and the pickle was perfectly sour, just like it should be."}
{"text":"Fantastic smoked meat sandwiches! This small deli is a must-visit gem of Montreal, everyone loves Schwartz's..even Celine Dion. Service is incredibly quick and friendly. I recommend getting the fries and pickles with your sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place if you love smoked meat! They only accept cash so but have an ATM if you only have debit."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. I am no expert on Jewish Delis but the smoked meat sandwich here was superb! (As was the coleslaw and frankfurter I had as sides). I really loved that there were only three sandwich options making it easy to pick the one it's most known for. The line for this famous hot spot wasn't too bad, as a party of seven we only waited about 15 mins on a Sunday afternoon and sit-down service was great and as might be expected at an older classic spot like this, it's cash only."}
{"text":"It's the famous spot for smoked meat in Montreal. Heck, they even have a musical about them. 

We had a blast. Went at an off time (3pm on a Monday) and got right in. Met some nice Franadiens who now live in the States. We all took each other's pictures. 

This was the second place we got smoked meat during our trip. Schwartz's got great marks. Less heavy on the brine/spices which allowed you to taste the actual meat. Bonus points for oil based cole slaw that was excellent. Be sure to grab a cherry soda and enjoy!"}
{"text":"When I arrived, there was a family of three and a party of twenty-seven on line in front of me. TWENTY-SEVEN. I later found out that the twenty-seven were part of a wedding party, which made more sense than the explanation in my head (meat sandwich-eating cult). In any event, I knew I was among friends, AKA other people who were also excited to be eating meat sandwiches.

Despite the large group ahead, the wait wasn't actually that long -- I was seated within 20-25 minutes next to another solo diner at the front counter. It was a lively place to take in my surroundings (light-up menu, fellow diners, cooking apparatus, sizzling meats, etc.). I had the Sandwich Viande Fumée (Smoked Meat sandwich) as well as a Cornichon (pickle), which collectively probably fulfilled my dietary salt needs for the next several weeks. 

Delicious; no frills."}
{"text":"We typically are not \"meat\" people, but had to try the smoked meat sandwich while in Montreal and this was the place to get it.  Excellent.  And very fun being served by Franco."}
{"text":"We arrived on Sunday night just before 9:pm. Shockingly, no line up.
We shared the smoked meet sandwich with fries and coleslaw. They were all very good and complimented each other very well. Our waiter was pleasant and quick. All in all, great food, great service and of course, the Schwartz's vibe."}
{"text":"This is like the katz delicatessen of montreal!  This place is sooo ultra famous!
The line to order to go was OUT THE DOOR.  Luckily we ate in... and some group was leaving.  Or else, just a few seconds later, we'd have to wait.  There was a lot of people waiting for seats too, oh my!

The waiter that we got was soooooo cool!  (He's the younger of all of them..) 
He explained the way the restaurant works, the history and even offered to help us take photos. He initiated it all.   VERY COOL!  I mean, prior to this visit, we've gone to a few restaurants  in the area and none of them gave a crap except to take our order and serve us our food.  So this Schwartz person reallyyyyy went out of his way.. and if you end up going there, you should be able to spot who it is and have him serve you.

Meanwhile, onto the more important matter: tHE FOOD!
The only thing you should probably order is the SMOKED MEAT!   the meat was flavored and smoked to perfection.  The texture was soft and smooth.  The flavors were so nice, you do not need mustard to accompany it.  
the pickle was nice and huge.. can order one.  
One sandwich already fills you up!

I am glad my friends recommended this place to me!"}
{"text":"This was on the list of must try things when I came to visit Montreal. There is two doors one for eating in and one for take out. There was a line for eating there and so I decided to get take out instead (there was a small line for take-out, but the line moved extremely quickly.) 

I got a smoked meat sandwich and I really wanted to try the smoked meat poutine but it was sold out by the time I got there (2pm). The sandwich was amazing, the meat was flavorful and it was delicious. I did not actually try anything else on the menu besides the smoked meat sandwich but that itself was definitely worth the trip there!"}
{"text":"Schwartz's is a must visit location in Montreal. If you are looking for a Smoked Meat sandwich, you must go to Schwartz's. I've been to the #2 location for smoked meat, and I will never make that mistake again. Always go to Schwartz's!! I live in the NY area and have been to Katz's deli. Schwartz's is better than Katz's. Some tips, prepare to wait. The lines, especially during peak hours, will be long. Not can be long, it will be long. They have two lines, one for sit in and another for take out. Here's a secret: there is also seating in the take out area. There is counter seating towards the back of the take out area. Shhh don't tell anyone! Some diehards might get mad at this post for revealing that. Also, they can put the smoked meat on top of your poutine - but only in the takeout area. They do not do this in the sit in area. However, if you do sit in and want smoked meat on your poutine, if you're nice enough, have a nice smile, and speak to your server, they may accommodate. I am 1 for 1 in convincing my server to put smoked meat on my poutine and he was nice enough to do so. Overall best smoked Montreal sandwich in all of Montreal! Prepare to wait! But the wait will be worth it!!"}
{"text":"Hey ay!  

So I love corned beef. Don't know why since I am not a huge fanatic about beef in general but if you like it (or even if you don't) go here and try it. 

Yes the \"restaurant\" (more like a hallway) is crowded. Yes it's touristy.  Yes, there is a lot of greasy fingerprints on the tables and walls.  But if you are here for the food, who really cares?  You think they are going to serve a pile of hot smoked meat on porcelain plate? 

It was so good, in fact, that we ordered a pound of meat (and the two necessary accompaniments: mustard and rye bread) to go.  Not very practical since we were headed to Quebec City in our nifty rental car.  There really isn't an easy way to transport smoked meat in car for 3 hours.  But it didn't last anyway.  We pulled over half way through for a bumper-side picnic.  And drove the rest of the way to Quebec City with greasy, mustard-y mugs. 

This place doesn't just sell itself as the best (for decades) it is."}
{"text":"Been a regular at this place and finally decided to write a review. 

This place is always extremely busy, no matter winter or summer. There is always a wait, sometimes the lines are insane. 

This place is best known for their Montreal smoked meat. I have to say, the smoke meat is pretty good if you know how to order.  Most people usually order medium fat. But the best smoke meat is the fatty ones. My boyfriend and I usually order a large plate of montreal smoke meat alone and share it. There's a plate sharing fee of $1.75, I believe. This included a side of bread. This is nicely paired with cherry coke. But sometimes we get cream soda. 

We've also gotten a Montreal chicken. The chicken was ok but I don't feel like it's worth it because it's more expensive than the smoked meat. I like the smoke meat better 

We've also tried the pickle. The pickle is a little too salty for our liking.  Fries here are also okay but the Montreal smoke meat is the main show. 

Overall, I would recommend to at least try this place. I like it but some people don't. 

P.s. If you want to avoid the dine in line, there is take out next door. They also have packaged meat that you can bring home."}
{"text":"Steve is the best server!  We ordered a pickle and two smoked meat sandwiches.  Since we were New Yorkers, we had to compare their smoked meat to Katz's deli, and I have to admit Schwartz's is better.  

We ordered a half-pound for a train ride home the next day, and Steve hooked it up. Order lean. The table next to us ordered a steak that looked great and some smoked meat.

This place is great. A must try."}
{"text":"OK, this is a Montréal standard that everyone much go at least once. The place is grungy and  the atmosphere is old school - I mean old school but it all comes together perfectly for the best smoke meat in the city, maybe the best smoke meat in the world. No honestly, it might be the best in the world. I have eaten smoke meat in other places but this place seems to have the perfect balance. Try it once an let me know what you think"}
{"text":"The first impression of the place is not the best, but to go in and experience the service, as well as, their dishes and costs, are great! It is a mandatory place to visit. Please note that you can only pay in cash!"}
{"text":"Normally, I wouldn't recommend eating at a Jewish Deli while touring the very French Montreal but this is a perfect place for a good and cheap lunch.  Located on St. Laurent street, there is plenty of parking on the street in and around the area.  It would be a long walk from the Old City but is very walkable from the North East area of the Mont Royal park.

There is generally a line out the door but it goes quickly.  I took off a star from the review because there isn't much room once you get inside the door.  The wall on the left hand side is lined with tables so cramped that generally the back of your chair is resting on the back of the chair of the person eating behind you.  The waiters are quick, courteous, and very accommodating even if you have a small child in your party.

As a New Yorker, I tend to compare any pastrami sandwich to that of our fabled Katz but I have to say that the hot pastrami sandwich with mustard was just as good, if not better than the one at Katz.  The only difference, a sandwich here will cost you $6 - $8 whereas the same sandwich in NYC will cost $16.  The pastrami is perfectly cooked, heaped onto rye bread, and melts in your mouth.  The hotdogs aren't bad either.

For three sandwiches and fries, the bill was around $19.  You cannot beat that.  They only accept cash and you pay up in the front of the deli.  They do take American dollars but will give change in Canadian coin.  If you are low on cash there is an ATM in the back by the bathrooms but don't depend on it as my Visa card didn't work there."}
{"text":"Holy cow.. what a difference. We tried this last year for a sit down meal but it was not as good as the take out. Why are people in line when there's take out next door!? The take out smoke meat sandwich was so juicy and yummy (it does get messy) but at least you can beat the lines. Eat it asap and while it's warm! When we ate inside last year (lined up for 10 mins), the bread was dry and so was the smoke meat. 

Pretty sure we are coming back here every visit for Schwartz's take out!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are really good.  I actually ate here twice on our trip to Montreal.  Once right after I ate a sit down lunch with my wife.

The smoked meat sandwiches are good.  Im not even a fan of 'smoked meat' , but boy are these good.  They come on rye bread too, and I dont like that, but this one was THAT good."}
{"text":"Had the smoked meat sandwich, slaw, fries, and pickle. 

The sandwich was very large. The meat was very tender, but did not have a smoke taste. It was like a good lean pastrami. The rye bread was crisp. 

The fries were excellent. They came piping hot and not too greasy. 

The slaw was very tasty. It was not the creamy variety, but rather a clear vinegar version. 

This is a very small old restaurant. We waited in about a half hour queue to get in at 13:00. I hear the queue can be up to an hour. 

The service is quick and not too friendly, but they are trying to push the crowds through. 

Maybe they do not have too many Jewish style deli restaurants in Montreal. That's why the Long queues????

The food was good, but not that much better than the typical Jewish style deli in the states that I have dined in. 

I would return to Schwartz's, but would not wait in some long queue to get in. Too many other great restaurants in Montreal that take a reservation."}
{"text":"HOLY EFF BOMB THIS SMOKED MEAT IS AMAZING. I'm from Texas so I know. 

Just get a damn smoked meat sandwich with a pickle, banana peppers and fries and you'll be in heaven. It's a diner, it's loud, it's hectic and crazy. It'll be a quick and dirty kinda meal but you'll walk away thinking \" wow. I want to eat here once a week\"."}
{"text":"Pour un smoke-meat aficionados tel que moi, impossible de ne pas écrire quelques lignes à propos de Schwartz's. Donc... c'est sans trop d'enthousiasme que j'accorde 3 étoiles à cette \" institution \" montréalaise. Une note correcte, sans plus. Voici pourquoi :

Oui, la viande ici est bonne, mais ce n'est pas la meilleure que j'ai goutée. La viande maigre (il faut dire \" lean \" car certains serveurs anglophones feront semblant de ne pas vous comprendre) est trop sec, il faut donc commander la régulière pour vraiment gouter un bon sandwich. 

Pour le reste, Schwartz's est un petit resto à l'ambiance médiocre. À l'intérieur, tout dégage une odeur de gras et de friture. Les tables sont minuscules, les chaises inconfortables, le service est \" garoché \", l'ambiance est bruyante sans être vivante ou sympathique. On vous incite à manger vite et à déguerpir dès la facture arrivée à table. 

Ce que je trouve dommage, c'est de voir à chaque été cette longue file de touristes, un petit guide de Montréal à la main, attendant patiemment d'avoir une table. Triste oui, car malheureusement pour nous les montréalais, les guides tels que Lonely Planet (ou autres) imposent Schwartz's comme la porte d'entrée \" culinaire \" de Montréal, alors que bien d'autres restos méritent l'attention des touristes, qu'ils servent du smoke-meat ou non.

Je le dirais toujours à nos amis touristes : vous désirez manger un bon sandwich smoke-meat et vivre une vraie belle expérience de resto de quartier à la montréalaise ? Alors quitter cette longue file d'attente et rendez-vous chez Lester sur la rue Bernard. La viande est aussi bonne sinon meilleure et l'ambiance est franchement plus authentique. Vous avez une voiture et vous êtes prêts à sortir de Montréal ? Alors prenez l'autoroute 720 direct Ouest et roulez jusqu'à île Perrot (30 minutes sans embouteillage).  Une fois passé le pont de l'autoroute du souvenir après Ste-Anne de Bellevue, vous verrez un resto au toit rouge nommé Smoke-Meat Pete. Un autre endroit que je conseil fortement."}
{"text":"Love making the pit stop in Montreal. Generally head to take out to avoid the long weekend line. Really only one order as far as I'm concerned - sandwich, pickle and cherry coke. Don't deviate!

As usual very tasty but knocked off one star for meat being a bit drier than I remember and less flavour. I ordered a medium - may need to go full fat next time."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in schwartz's deli.  Visiting Montreal, this place had a lot of hype.  I expected a line, and there was one.  I went on a Friday around 2, so the line wasn't terrible.  I probably  waited around 25 minutes.  The staff seemed a little flustered, so when we were seated, we were just told at the door to go to the table all the way in the back.  We went to the table, and it hadn't been bused which was a little irritating.  We waited for a buser to clean it, and when he did, he didn't change the dirty paper mats - I had to ask him to.  The smoked meat sandwich is very good (hence the second star), but the service was not.  We also didn't realize it was cash only, which is partly my fault, but the sign in the restaurant that states this is actually behind the entrance, so you don't see it when you walk in.  They do accept the USD; however, they haven taken the liberty of creating their own exchange rate that upcharges you 10%.  The woman at the register is very unfriendly, and based on service alone, I would never go back."}
{"text":"Gotta trust the hype when you see 500+ reviews on this place. When you walk in, you'll see the wall plastered with praises and even a musical based on this deli and its smoked meat. A musical?? Yeah.

The place was packed on 3 PM on a Friday afternoon, and luckily we were seated right away. As the waiter came around to take our order, my boyfriend was originally planning to order the pastrami sandwich, before the waiter suggested the smoked meat was the one to try. His exact words? \"After you try our smoked meat sandwich, you won't even want to eat pastrami ever again.\"

Was that true? Not exactly.....don't get me wrong, the smoked meat was bommmmb. It was so good, I finished the whole thing and that never happens to me and my small appetite. But some parts of the meat were dry, and I did have to force down a few gulps with water. But it's pretty damn impressive, considering they were able to render such juicy slices of meat just by smoking it. 

I would definitely recommend this place as a place to experience in Montreal, from its old-school atmosphere (complete with ample counter seating) to its variety of deli sandwiches and meat by the pound. This place takes American cash, which is always a plus, and you pay at the counter in front. Happy grubbing!"}
{"text":"this place is an institution...a must for tourist and locals!
its also gross and the atmosphere is dull...but who the F cares, the smoked meat (corn beef for south of the border) is AWESOME!
the line-up are for a reason...expect them, but they are fast!"}
{"text":"Yep, the smoked meat sandwich really is as damned good as legend says.  

Unfortunately, to get a truly filling meal of smoked meat sandwich you need to order at least 2-3 sides (because the sides' portions here are bloody TINY, unlike across the border in the fat-o-rama known as the US), and the prices are VERY Canadian, with of course a tourist premium.  And if you are unfortunate enough to not carry Canadian dollars with you, they'll take your US dollars but at an exchange rate that's very very favorable to THEM.  So, be forewarned: get some local currency before you head over here!

Anticipate about $20 per person, add another $5 for a non-alcoholic drink.  

The food is great, the service decent, the blue-collar ambience is cozy and down-home and lively, but $25 a head for this kind of deli food is pretty darn steep even in NYC.

So, while I did quite enjoy the sandwich and don't regret coming, I don't see myself coming back here again next time.  I can get a lot more food, and healthier food, just a couple blocks over in Chinatown or in the University area.  

Did make me miss cheap-massive-portions America a bit, though...hahaha!"}
{"text":"My husband the carnivore, LOVED this place. He said the meat was smoked and tender and just amazing. There's a long line to eat inside the restaurant, but the take out line is short and you can grab a stool by the counter and eat there as well. Excellent quality and soft and juicy strips keep you well fed in the cold!"}
{"text":"First of all, everything is seen and tasted through my lens of NY deli experience.

The place is small and popular, hence the long line. We came at 11pm on a friday night in whats probably the off tourist season so we had no wait. But the ambiance/experience of eating in was nothing special to me (me having had the Jewish deli experience already, that is). So I'd take-out before I'd wait more than 15 mins myself. Don't be afraid to sit at the counter, though, as you'll have attentive service there; clearly the most animated server was stationed at the counter when we were there (our service was dull and lifeless). 

Its silly not to get a smoked meat sandwich of course. I didn't know about the cut/leanness options and just got what they gave me. And it was great. I've been spoiled by Katz's pastrami. But Im sure this is the next best thing outside of NY delis. This is shreddier than pastrami, I should note. It really falls apart; so be prepared for that. And its a little less flavorful than NY pastrami; it doesnt have that dark, peppery crust as much. Despite what you see in the window. Still great. These are smaller and cheaper than NY's. Get your own; dont share it. A half sour completes the experience. Though this one had the light green color I like, it lacked salt. The cole slaw was more vinegary than Im used to, not mayo, and more finely shredded. It was good, if different.

One thing I just could not get over. Not a Jewish-face staff member in the house! Couldnt get over it."}
{"text":"For smoked meat: Think Pastrami. And if you like pastrami you have to have to go here.  If there's a long line, (and there might be - I was there over Christmas break) then get the sandwich to go.  You'll miss some of the essence of the place, but believe me, the sandwich will make up for it. A real gem. I tell everyone I know who visits Montreal that they have to make time to go to Schwartz's."}
{"text":"A disclosure is in order - it is probably impossible to get me to admit that a Jewish deli anywhere could measure up to the exacting standards set by the iconic establishments in New York. That said, a trip to Schwartz's was an unexpectedly pleasant experience. Granted their \"smoked meat\" is not exactly pastrami, but it was excellent - flavorful, succulent, and tender. On top of it, the pickles were fine and the coleslaw (I selected the one effectively without dressing) was fresh and tasty. So, when in Montreal, by all means give this place a go - it's a fine establishment. You can certainly get a nice deli sandwich in this town. Montreal-style bagels, however, are a completely different story..."}
{"text":"Quick in and out standing in the take out only side. The guy takin orders was all business and you need to be ready with your order before you even get up to him. Husband and I split a hot smoked meat sandwich which was delish. We walked right across the street and sat on some cool wooden bench in the sun. Comes on rye with a little mustard. This place is famous for a reason. Grab a pickle on top of the meat counter!"}
{"text":"Staff is pushy and rude. There is so much good food in Montreal... this is overrated, mediocre and not worth the treatment you receive. Go somewhere else, anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great service at this historical deli on one of Montreals most popular streets.  It's cash only so come prepared.  Also depending on the time you get here there may be a line or the door .  I arrived at around 5pm on a Friday and was seated immediately.  

I got the smoked beef sandwich.   They give you an option of lean,  medium,  or \"fat.\"  The medium had enough flavor for my tatse.  The sandwich comes with mustard.   It was tender and packed with beef.  My only knock on the sandwich was i was it was a bit hotter.  By the time I got to the last bite it was barely warm.    I also ordered a side of fries.  The fries were fairly plain and a bit overcooked."}
{"text":"Amidst our travels to Montréal we accumulated some great stories, met some awesome people, drank some stellar drinks and through it all there seems to be one thing everyone agrees on - come for the smoked meat. Montréal smoked meat is made by salting and curing brisket with spices and using some sort of delicious wizardry. We had heard that Schwartz's was an institution in Montréal and the frequent line down the street solidifies this claim. We were lucky enough to drive by on our way out of town and when we saw there was no line we decided to go for it.

We picked up a few sandwiches for the ride home and because of this we were able to skip dinner. This was our second encounter with this awesome creation; after having it under eggs and hollandaise at Restaurant l'avenue, we had to give it a shot in its most famous incarnation - on rye bread with house-made mustard. We are glad we were able to squeeze this into our trip and our mouths are watering thinking about it, so check 'em out!

If you check out Scwartz's on Yelp, you'll find the main complaints to be about long lines and limited space. So if you're impatient and/or claustrophobic, don't try to go during lunch hours and get your grub to go!

You can also check out Scwartz's website, though there really is no need - get the smoked meat, the menu is irrelevant.

If you think smoked meat sounds similar to pastrami, we have no idea what the difference is - but the guy who wrote this article does, so read it if you're curious!

{"text":"This is a Montreal institution, and an essential part of the Montreal experience. Do come here, sit at the counter and order a smoked meat sandwich (medium of course) with a cherry cola. Look around at the crowded tiny space, and soak in the atmosphere. 

Once you have gone once, and have experienced the great smoked meat, and the overall craziness that is the Schwartz experience, I would suggest sticking to the Main across the street for equally good smoked meat, and booths where you can sit and relax without bumping elbows. Also beer."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY! - know before you go!

If you don't want to wait in line, go to the take-out window. It's one door to the left. 

Great. Damn. Sandwhich. Get the slaw. Eat the pickle. Simple fare at a low price and a great experience."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is famous for their smoked meat sandwich, but to be honest, it's not the best!

It's a small hole in the wall place that can mostly fit a maximum of 30 people. There's mostly one thing you want to order, a smoked meat sandwich, if you're in a big group of people, you can order it so that they can give you a few slices of bread and give you your smoked meat on the side, and then you can make your own sandwich. 

So about the sandwiches, like I said before, it's not the best. It's actually kinda salty in my opinion, but then again, maybe that's how it's supposed to be!?!? I feel like it would be so much better with melted cheese in there!!! It would definitely help with the saltiness of the meat. 

One sandwich is good enough for me. There are other stuff that you can order, but everyone goes there for the smoked meat. I would recommend going here if you wanna try the \"famous smoked meat\" but it's mostly all hype to me. 

But anyways, the reason I'm giving such a high review even for a so-so experience is because our server Eddie was awesome! He was knowledgeable, friendly, and funny! He knew we were from the States so he told us stuff about the restaurant and engaged in some cool conversations with me. 

Tips:
The smoked meat will come as trim, medium fat, or fatty! Get medium or fatty! I actually liked fatty a lot more!"}
{"text":"Just tasty, rye bread sandwiches with yellow mustard spread for the jiggling pile of warm slices, the goodness is that the teeth just sink in the, through the, job."}
{"text":"It's famous for a reason!

I agree with everyone else. DEFINITEly get the smoked meat sandwich and at least get the medium cut. For me, it was the perfect amount of fat to go along with the meat. Enough that you get bites of the melt-in-your-mouth taste and texture but not so much that it overpowers everything else."}
{"text":"Perfect for what it is.  Went in thinking I'd be let down and ... I was not.  A great deli and a great sandwich.   Wait wasn't very long at all for us either so that was a nice surprise! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Visted Schwartz from San Francisco and heard they had the best smoked meat sandwhich ever.  However, let me be honest it was not.  The problem was that it didn't taste smoked to me.  Just like a real good corned beef sandwhich that had been cooked for a few hours with pickling spices.   I tried the Karnatzel too and it was so-so.    

All in all Schwartz's was good but I think my expectations were set too high.  If you go, make sure to get a pickle and a sweetpepper too!"}
{"text":"Don't understand the hype. There are better places to get smoked meat in MTL...such a tourist trap."}
{"text":"Been to Monteal many times, but never had the time to make it here, but on my last trip, I just had to make the time.

And when I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't busy and I had the whole bar section pretty much all to myself.

And as for the sandwich itself, that smoked meat had a lot of flavors. Pickle paired well too.

Montreal is known for smoked meat. And you can pretty much get it anywhere...but you need to get here as well. It's pretty good."}
{"text":"Wow 90 years. It is rare to have a restaurant with this long history.
Every time we go to Schartz's, I have a smoked meat sandwich and my hubby has a small plate. We can choose lean, medium and fat. I always go with medium. He may have half medium and half fat. Pickle and coleslaw, and definitely the famous cherry drink.
This time we also ordered a smoked duck and picked up after 3 days. I like the duck also. 
We usually go there on weekdays to avoid the queue."}
{"text":"You probably don't need any more convincing but this place is a must-go for Montreal visitors. A local classic. A gem of the area (or nation even). An dime piece of a restaurant. The mia khalifa of restaurants. If you don't already know Mia khalifa, I don't recommend you googling her.
The corned beef is very tender and juicy!!! So goooood! Don't get anything else. Just the corned beef sandwich, a pickle and a side of fries (poutines get sickening after 3 days)
We came as a group of 6 at 5:30pm. No line!!!!!
If you come after 7, better bring a funny friend to keep you entertained for hours. 
Also, cheap AF."}
{"text":"It is a must go restaurant in Montreal just for the experience. It is quite interesting the way they keep the service flow of the restaurant. They have their own rules and you just follow them as you were in a money msking machine. You are the client but you are not do important here.

I went there alone. I could only eat at the bar because they would prefer me to go away than to give me a table. Inside you are well treated but everything happens really fast, you cannot eat calmly her!

The smoke meat is not nothing special. Its dry meat and I couldn't eat it without mostard... It's not tasty at all (at least considering all the hype).

When it is time to pay, you get to know that a restaurant like that only accepts cash by a really rude cashier that won't even look at you (you already went through the money making machine, you are no longer necessary).

I am not going back there but it was an interesting experience. Basically they know that the demand is much larger than their capacity. They have some critical points on the process where they want you to feel good, but the main issue is the customers/time rate. I just felt being sympathetically pushed all the time."}
{"text":"I've heard lots of great things about Schwartz and so my friends and I decided to try it out as we planned our road trip to Montreal. Luckily there was no line when we went, but I heard there's usually a huge line. 

To start off, Schwartz is quite small and has that old diner feel to it. Even though it's small, their sandwiches are definitely not small! My friends and I ordered the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich, poutine, and the black cherry drink. The poutine was alright, just tasted like normal poutine, but the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich was absolutely amazing! There was so much meat stacked in the sandwich and mustard on the bread complimented the meat nicely.

Also, beside Schwartz, they had a \"take out\" Schwartz store that let you buy the meat to make your own sandwiches at home! My friends and I bought some of the packed meat to take home. The coolest part of this was that there was a tac board filled with napkins pinned on it with people writing comments about where they're from and what they thought of Schwartz!   

If you're ever in Montreal, definitely stop by here, even if there's a line! It's definitely worth experiencing it! This was definitely the best part of the trip!"}
{"text":"I made two Jewish deli pilgrimages this year, and thus far, Schwartz has it!  (sorry, Katz's).  

The meat is fall apart in your mouth perfect.  Their poutine is good too!  It was more orderly than other deli places too.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Le smoked meat est pas mal mais ce n'est absolument pas le meilleur comme beaucoup le pense. Ce restaurant est un attrape touristes, les employés ne sont pas souriant et le lieu n'est pas très propre ..."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Montreal I make a point to come here. It's so great in fact, I buy the meat by the pound and take it back to Toronto as souvenirs. I've had smoked meat from many other places but none does it better than Schwartz. Definitely worth the hype and the line. The decor is simple and very no-frills but it serves it's purpose.The staff is friendly and moves very fast. The sandwich goes great with a pickle and cherry coke."}
{"text":"Great, old-school Montreal smoked meat sandwiches. Be sure to get a pickle."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the wait if the line is down the block but it's not too bad if you can walk right in and sit which happened to me the other day which was a first in years. Would definitely recommend the smoked meat sandwich which is similar to Katz deli in NYC but they get offended when you tell them their meat is basically Pastrami. Their Cole slaw is pretty good as well if you want some condiments on the side."}
{"text":"To order: smoked meat sandwich (medium fat), a black cherry to drink, fries to share, side plate of pickles and coleslaw. Trust me you will leave content. Arrive early on the weekends to avoid the long line. If the line is long, don't be disappointed, it moves fast. There's also a hat shop across the street which you can explore while your friends wait in line. Btw, don't be a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Don't miss this place. It is not a fancy restaurant. The food is great. I really like the waiters. You may wait for a while or may sit beside strangers. But it is worth. I recommend you half steak half smoked meat plate."}
{"text":"This review is only for the take out, because I did not like some of the serving staffs there and was not going to go back.  My dinning partner wanted smoke meat, and when we get there, there were more than 50% Asian tourist (a mix of majority of Japanese and some Chinese tourist).  We decided to go for take out.  If there were no tourist, the place would only be just less than half full.   

The smoke meat is cool plenty of favor, but because I found that the staffs attitude towards foreigner was not nice, I will never give it a 4 stars.  In England, there is a piece of legislation that restaurants and hotels have to give everyone the same kind of service regardless of the person's race, sex, sexual oriental, age or disabilities... etc.  Of course it is hard to prove, but nonetheless, I like the food here, but not the service."}
{"text":"Couldn't see what the hype was all about! Decent smoked meat joint. Tho I wouldn't wait in line for a seat in there."}
{"text":"My wife was here long ago when training for Air Canada. It has not changed according to her in over 20 years. Still a great deli, glad I experienced it!"}
{"text":"I love the smoked meat and pickles. I visit here every time I'm in Montreal. I recommend it."}
{"text":"the medium smoked meat sandwich is a MUST HAVE. get with a cherry soda and pickles!

i'm not usually into sandwiches, but this was probably my favorite food place in montreal. i went twice during my trip!

amazing food and service - definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The wait is long but totally worth it.  I ordered to go so I can't rate  the service but they looked very efficient.  The food reminds me of a deli in Brooklyn."}
{"text":"5 star for being an authentic gem with simple and delicious food and lovely staff who go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your time in this popular Montreal staple. 

My verdict: you can't go wrong with Schwartz's."}
{"text":"Un classique et un lieu historique.
Je recommande la version médium de la smoke meat-pas trop sèche par rapport à la version maigre,pas trop grasse par rapport justement à la version grasse trop grasse.
On y partage souvent la table avec d'autres clients e toutes nationalités ,mais un peu serrés quand même ! 
D'autres bonnes adresse quand même:Reuvens sur Ste Catherine ou Snowdon  deli sur Decarie ou encore Lester rue Bernard histoire de faire le smoke meat tour de Montreal!"}
{"text":"An original in the city, this deli specializes in their smoked meat sandwich, that can be ordered with some usual diner/deli fare. Ordered the classic Montreal smoked meat sandwich that comes on rye with a splash of mustard. The meat was full of flavour, juicy, and extremely tender. The portion for $10 CAD was generous. My only issue is the bread is an afterthought. Undersized for the sandwich, would love a bit more to handle the piles of meat. Don't bother with the \"special soda\" they suggest with a generic Walmart style brand of cherry soda. Would definitely come back on my next trip to Montreal. Definitely should be on everyone's list of stops. EXCELLENT smoked meat."}
{"text":"Came here during a quickie weekend trip to Montreal based on friend recommendations and reading up on food articles. While this place is touristy and busy, it is 100% deserving of all the business it gets. The interiors of the place are lowkey and kinda dingy, but that is the charm of it. And the minute you walk in, you will be hit with the absolute best meaty smells. You will not regret coming here. 

Firstly, everything on the menu is so affordable (especially if you're coming from the US, given the current favorable exchange rate). My boyfriend and I got two smoked meat sandwiches to go since it would have taken a little while to get seated, and we didn't mind eating ours back at home. Let me tell you, this smoked meat was absolutely DIVINE. So juicy, tender, and flavorful. Straight up blew my mind. As someone from NYC who's eaten a fair amount of deli sandwiches, it blew all my previous sandwich experiences out of the water. 

Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Value: 5/5 (Cash only though & ATM inside restaurant does not accept american debit)"}
{"text":"I've been to Schwartz's several times, with my first visit being nearly 10 years ago and my latest being yesterday.  Eagle eyed Yelpers may even remember that it was in my profile pic for the longest time!  And what's not to say about this storied Montreal deli that's not already been said: delicious, melt-in-your-mouth sandwiches that are cheap, filling, and will give any NY delicatessen a serious run for their money.

There's always a wait outside to get into this hole-in-the-wall of a restaurant, but once you brave the cold queue, you're packed into the seats one of the many communal tables.  You could order anything other than the smoked meat, but you'd be kidding yourself if you did.  It's a seriously amazing sandwich, and unlike its New York counterpart, not oversized to the point where you'd burst.  The fries are good too: not too greasy and a great complement to the sandwich.  Bonus points also for a pretty healthy-tasting cole slaw (little mayo).

One can't wonder, with the press clippings lining the walls, the posters advertising \"Schwartz's: The Musical\", and the paraphernalia for sale, if Schwartz's had indeed \"jumped the shark\" and ventured its way into tourist trap territory.  Judging from the overwhelming amount of English I heard throughout the restaurant, I'd venture to say that Schwartz's may be more popular with tourists and out-of-towners than the locals.  However, the food still stands up to the critical praise, and you certainly won't be disappointed from your visit.  This food is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are amazing and the poutine was delicious as well. One of my favorite meals in Montreal."}
{"text":"I still love Katz, but Schwartz is pretty amazing as well.  The flavours are different, I'd say the rye bread at Schwartz is better (more moist and has a  fresh springiness to the texture).  Because it's a smaller shop, the line is quite daunting when you first arrive, but it moves fast, and yes I would say it's worth the visit.  Don't bother getting anything else but a smoked meat sandwich with pickle, you miss the point of going to Schwartz if you're not going to indulge in the smoked meat."}
{"text":"Je ne mange aucun smoke meat, dans aucun fast-food connus... Mais schwartz's je peux manger la viande seule sans pains, moutarde et cornichon! Je vous le recommande à 100%"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. Oldest deli in Canada serves up smoked meats and delicious sides. Great atmosphere. Enjoyed sitting at the deli counter to watch the staff in action and meet some very interesting folks from around the world. Doctor from Germany on my left, lawyer from NYC on my right, and myself aeronautical engineering from Seattle made for some excellent dinner conversation. Can't wait to visit Montreal again and Schwartz's Deli will definitely be on the itinerary!"}
{"text":"So, a lot of people put this as a \"must go\" for Montreal. If you've never been to New York then you might find this to be true. Otherwise, though, I would say skip it. The smoked beef is good, the food IS cheap, but it is definitely nothing special or unique. The bread is standard \"bimbo\" bread...the french fries were standard but still pretty OK."}
{"text":"We were really disappointed by our Schwartz's experience. The line for the restaurant side was around 45 minutes long, which in itself makes one wonder seriously if the place may have wandered into myth territory because the reality of the sandwich that we found on the take-out side was that the meat is dry and bland (a once-off perhaps?) but it was great with extra mustard to add flavour. I've eaten countless smoked meat sandwiches over the years so I have an idea of what a good one should be like. The staff who took our order and served the greasy mess in a bag seemed to have no joie de servir  - I guess that's the burden of their legendary popularity - but the cashier lady did smile and thank us for our business which we liked. Over all it was an experience we might try one more time just to make sure this one wasn't a fluke."}
{"text":"Schwartz's came recommended by a tour-guide in Montreal as a one of a kind Montreal lunch/dinner that we shouldn't miss. Did I mention he was a brewery tour guide? Because being about 5 beers deep makes smoked meat taste amazing. Maybe that skews my review a bit, so you can take it or leave it. 

Pickles are one of my favorite foods, and I loved every second of the giant pickle I ordered. Paired with a coke and a side of fries, this was a pretty good lunch. 

I'm not one to complain about lines. If a place is delicious enough, I will wait up to an hour. I was in line for about 20 minutes, and I have to say if I came here again and I saw that line, I would probably decide not to go in. Not because it was bad, but just because I could probably find something else to suit my drunk cravings. 

It was very crowded but the selection was minimal, so I made a quick decision that I was happy with. The meat was drier than I was expecting, but still very tasty. Add dat mustard and you'll be good.

The atmosphere was deli-ish. I don't know how else to describe that. Be prepared to sit at a table with people you don't know. The people who work there are kind of scary, in that fun, angry-city-deli-man way. As our tour guide told us, it's all part of the experience. Should you make this part of your Montreal experience? Sure! Is it a must? Nah."}
{"text":"I heard and saw so many horror stories of this place so when I planned to be in Montreal, I purposely skipped Schwartz in my itinerary. As I was walking by, I didn't see any line like I heard there would be, so I ended up walking in and ordered me a smoked meat sandwich. Anddd it was actually pretty good loaded with all the beefy goodness. I couldn't go to other famous smoked meat spots to compare but it wasn't bad :p"}
{"text":"As advertised ... amazing smoked meat sandwich, fries, and cherry coke.  Need I say more?  Go!"}
{"text":"A local who has since relocated to NYC recommended I check this place out on a recent trip. At first I was a bit wary - I mean, NY is chock full of great kosher delis, so could this be any different or better?

After making my way here, I have to say the hype is real! Yes, it's touristy, but you still have a good contingent of locals eating here. I had the smoked meat sandwich, and it was one of the best I've had. Very simple - bread, mustard, and meat - but perfect. The brisket was super moist, just the right amount of fat, and full of flavor. The mustard (which you can actually buy by the bottle) was a perfect complement. I think I'd have to say I like this place better than any of the kosher delis I've been to in NYC.

Service is friendly, and fortunately for me I had no wait (although I went at a weird hour). I believe the place is cash only. This needs to be on everyone's stop if it's your first time visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I skipped the line and just got a 1/4 pound of meat and a small side of coleslaw at the deli counter. I would have had a sandwich, but the day was early and I wanted to save room for other spots on my list. Also, it's a bit hard to go to a Schwartz's when you are traveling with a vegetarian friend. Meat was delicious and just the right amount of fat. Seriously falls apart, which is slightly comical when you're siting on a bench trying fork some into your mouth, horrifying your non-meat eating friend with your carnivours ways. Coleslaw was great, nice and crisp which cut through the fat taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"amazing atmosphere, yummy smoked meat, great 1/2 sour pickle and no mayo coleslaw.  It felt like a locals spot, but booming. Definitely old school.  Cash Only with an ATM in the back."}
{"text":"Now this is the definition of a  smoked meat/ pastrami sandwich. I have a tendency to be a harsh reviewer when it comes to these types of meats because I've sampled very good pastrami/ smoked meat in NYC. When I saw this place on television and heard from my friends about the place while researching in Montreal, I became excited to see what the hype was all about. 

Little education for novices--smoked meat is akin to the combination of pastrami and corned beef--having the rich fatty, peppered skin of pastrami, but the lean, tender texture of corned beef.

Somebody call my momma-- I was NOT disappointed at all. 

I encountered a long line when I strolled up to the restaurant but was not deterred.
This was the best food I had during my Montreal experience. The sandwich comes in three different options--lean, fatty, and medium (which is a combination of the two). I ordered a smoked meat sandwich, double fried french fries, and a 1/2 sour pickle. This was awesome and satisfied the smoked meat fix that I developed after hearing about this place--fatty and lean, one bite melting the fat in your mouth. The fries were amazing as was the pickle. Wash it all down with a cherry coke ladies and gentleman-- its the perfect compliment to this meal.

I went back after and tries a lean sandwich for comparison and must say that the medium is definitely the way to go.

Here's a good hint--if you want to avoid the long lines, then come an hour before closing time. You will be served immediately BUT risk not receiving a fresher piece of smoked meat.

Good operation you guys have up there North at Schwartz's my friends. Keep it up! You live up to the hype and are comparable (and dare I say better?) than the NYC sandwich institutes of Carnegie Deli and Katz's Deli."}
{"text":"All I can say is... Just do it! This MTL staple is worth the hype for all foodies. Wait in line for as long as necessary to try that smoked meat. So worth the wait. Thankfully our wait was only a short 10 min at 9:00pm on a Monday night. Don't order anything else but the #3. Juicy, flavorful, especially if you have a small piece of fat in there. We also had a juicy pickle on the side. I don't know what else to say, but it was AMAZING. I regret not buying one \"to-go\" for later. 

They had a cherry soda which one of the workers recommended, but tasted like Dimetap, not a fan. Stop by an ATM first, cash only."}
{"text":"Good smoked meat (seems like pastrami to me). Portion size of food is much better than New York's over the top delis, and well priced. If you like smoked beef, this is a great place."}
{"text":"Okay!  I'm just not a smoked meat fan!  I had the expectation that this sandwich would blow me away, and given that I eat meat maybe 3-4 times a year, I'm certainly not hard to please.  Regardless, I wasn't a fan of the texture or dryness of the meat and regretted the feeling of digesting that sandwich for 5+ hours...

I did, however, really like the cole slaw and the pickles.  The service was also great and the nostalgic pictures, signs, etc. were fun to look at.  There were mostly tourists eating, but I did notice a few regulars."}
{"text":"It's been a few weeks since our visit to Schwartz's and I still salivate thinking about this sandwich! When we got there, the line for sit-down service was easily 40-50 people deep, so we went to the take-out line instead. Still a long line that weaved up and down the length of the store, but in reality, we only waited 20-30 minutes?

We got the medium fat smoked meat sandwich and it was perfect- not too fatty, not too dry. The mustard in the sandwich gives it the perfect balance. We also got an order of poutine (no meat). It was good, but definitely not as spectacular as the sandwiches. The cheese curds were super fresh and squeaky, but perhaps a little too heavy for just 2 people with a sandwich each. If you decide to get take-out, there's a little park 2 blocks away where we ate our food and it was perfect."}
{"text":"A staple in the Montreal meat market we had to try it. Luckily the weather was nice out because we spent more time outside waiting than inside eating. Fast and efficient, not necessarily a bad thing. 

I felt like we were in a boxcar as we sat at a table that we shared with a family of 4. Not so bad, sure there's a little awkward conversation at first and maybe an unintentional photobomb or two, but those are first world problems.   

Don't expect a menu because it's up on the wall. It's small. Meat, meat, more meat and a few sides. 

We started with the poutine. Not their strength. Soggy fries, though they tasted like real potato fries and I wished we had opted for the plain fries.

We ordered the meat sandwich (lean), clever name you might add and yes it is their famed beef brisket sandwich served on humble slices of a baguette. 

Always looking to diversify my options I ordered the turkey sandwich, big mistake. It was deli turkey, tough texture, and flavorless.  I wish we had just ordered another meat sandwich. 

So in the end I'm glad we went because the beef was delicious and unlike anything I've ever had but with so much good food in Montreal it's hard to say this is a must do if you only have a limited number of meals in the city."}
{"text":"Last time I was in Montreal, about 8 years ago, I took a walk after dinner and came across this amazing deli. I was already full from dinner but I was so tempted to eat again just to try the delicious looking smoked beef.  Sadly, didn't want to eat 2 dinners and I've been regretting it ever since.  EIGHT YEARS of regret!

So immediately after landing at the airport, i hightailed it to Schwartz's and it was actually better than I expected! We got there around 9pm on a Saturday and there was a line of about 20 people waiting to get inside. The line actually moved fairly quickly and we were seated at the bar after about 15 minutes. The waiter was very friendly and insisted that we get a sandwich, fries, pickle and a drink. That sounded just about perfect, but just as he put in my order for a medium sandwich, corrected him and told him that I wanted a FATTY sandwich. The FATTY was actually perfectly marbled and and was absolutely delicious. The sandwich was very simply made - about 3.5 inches of thinly sliced smoked beef, with a little bit of mustard, between 2 slices of rye bread. The fries were OK, and the pickle was OK. I wanted some veggies so I also asked for a side of slaw which was tangy and sweet. The sandwich was amazing and I'm glad that I finally got to have one after waiting 8'years for it."}
{"text":"They have a cross between a corn beef and a pastrami sandwich which has a light amount of peppers. It's called a beef sandwich. It's their signature sandwich.The prices are so unbelievably reasonable for the quality that you get I can highly recommend this place. The coleslaw has a little bit of sauerkraut taste to it. It was really nice as well."}
{"text":"Get a smoked meat sandwich and a black cherry soda. You will leave happy."}
{"text":"I first need to apologize to Canada. I have not been very nice to you. I've heard it said that Canada is America's attic ... you know it's up there but you're not sure what's in it. 

(If you just want to read about the Menu/Food ... scroll down.) 

That's how I felt. I did ZERO research on your beautiful Montreal. Fact is, I wasn't even sure if you drove on the same side of the road as I'm use to. So when I casually asked the rental car attendant where to grab lunch, and was told Schwartz's for smoke meat, I dismissed the idea as something like a Togo's or Quizno's. I'd never heard of smoked meat. It seemed to me logical to go where the guy I was talking to on my flight thought I would like ... Moishe's. ($$$$x10) 

I made my way to St-Lauarent Blvd or Bole St Laurent and saw Schwartz's right next door to Moishe's. The line and the cold temp, 2 degrees Celsius, I instinctively knew this place must be something special. BTW Americans, 2 Celsius is about 38 degrees ... I know, I was confused too. 
I made it in the door of this narrow and tight old old place. The group behind me were told to wait outside. No slack here for anyone. Someone actually wrote a play about this place. Given I was in the door I was going to relax and enjoy the experience as this is just one of those places you need to observe and blend into.

Ten minutes after arriving I was seated at a table for four. Thought it odd as the place was too busy to leave three seats empty. WRONG. They brought four more and we all shared this small space. It was fun. My table mates spoke French beautifully but had no French accent when helping understand the Schwartz's tradition. My new friends were very tolerant of a provincial guy like me. 

THE FOOD. 

I memorized the menu ... its that limited. I had the smoked meat, I think its Canadian for pastrami, sandwich with mustard. (no need to tell them rye bread as that's all they have) and a pickle. Very good. You can order more flavorful (fattier cuts) smoked meat if you want but I took the standard fare. I also had a coke no ice. Not sold on that tradition yet. 

It was a delicious sandwich. The pickle was crisp and snappy. The mustard was obviously home made and the bread? Whats not to love? Jewish Rye. Fresh, moist, great crust. How can you ask for more? Good thing as you wont get it. 

I had a blast and was really glad I decided to try it. Thank you Budget Car Rental and my friends with whom I shared a table. 

My sincere apologies Montreal. Thank you for the intro to smoked meats and a great time."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Cool place. Sort of a dirty diner type feel that always has traffic. We saw all walks of life going to this place so it was relatively diverse. The staff was also a good reflection of that. 

Food: AWESOME!!!! Got the smoked meat plate, cole slaw, pickles and fries. Again, AWESOME. My wife usually hates smoked flavor but did like the food here. I thought it was great! 

Service: Great service, we sat at the bar and were attended to immediately. As soon as we were done, the bill was ready. Great service 

Overall: You have to go here. It is a staple spot in Montreal that you have to experience."}
{"text":"Well, we came 'cause it's the most popular restaurant here and everyone said we must try smoked meat. It is a small restaurant with limited seating so we were lucky that we snagged a table for ourselves during dinner time. Coming from Texas, we had some really high expectations of smoked meat.

We ordered a smoked meat sandwich which had a lot of meat stuffed in it. The meat was good, soft, and tender. I wouldn't say it's the best smoked meat out there though. It is a different kind of smokiness and a bit underwhelming. However, if you're in town, it's something you should try anyways."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat and be with family.  We always drop by when we are visiting Montreal.  The food is always hot, fresh and very delicious.  I recommend this iconic restaurant to all!"}
{"text":"I've been to Shwartz about 10 times since moving to Montreal  about 6 years ago.. Every time I go I enjoy my smoked meat sandwich and cherry coke and ponder when would be the next time I can come out and have one (I am on a diet, you see).

Flavour is amazing. Sandwich itself is cheap (around $6-7). Line is not that long (just dont go on the weekends or during lunch / dinner time). Much better than the Main, Lesters, snowdon, etc.."}
{"text":"Un peut déçu pas aussi bon que dans le temps!"}
{"text":"Oh Schwartz, you've stolen my heart from Katz. Trekked here from downtown with my friend to try the famed Montreal-style smoked meat sandwich. After 4 or 5 previous meals that day, we decided to go light and split a smoked beef sandwich on rye and a side of fries.  We regretted this decision as soon as the first bite of that fatty brisket hit our mouth. Ended up ordering another sandwich for my friend and a plate of just brisket for myself (I like to pretend I'm eating low carb when things like that happen). The waiter warned me that I had ordered enough extra meat for two sandwiches, but clearly he had no idea who he was talking to since I easily finished it all.

Line wasn't bad and moved quickly. Service was friendly, if brisk, which is understandable given the crowds."}
{"text":"Montreal incontournable! Worth the wait! Satisfying every time! Consider buying a lbs of warm smoked meat for take out."}
{"text":"The goal of this place is to get you in and out while providing you with the best smoked meat sandwich on earth in between.  And it succeeds.  Simply put, if you are into food, you should take the trip to Schwartz's at least once in your life.  Service is okay, it is noisy, the wait is long at lunch, and the place is not big on the inside.  But, the goal is to enjoy some amazing smoked meat prepared by guys who have dedicated their lives to doing it, so dive in taste buds first and you'll emerge with a smile."}
{"text":"This smoked meat sandwich goooooood.

Sunday lunch hour is insane. Instead of waiting in line for waiter service, we waited in line next door for take out. However, there are seats in the back of the store and if you're okay eating with people waiting behind you, then this is a-ok.

Food: Smoked meat sandwich, duh. I actually think I prefer this over pastrami from NY delis, whoops. The meat is so flavorful, moist, and they put the right amount of mustard on the sammy. The bread is super soft and the sandwich as a whole is thoroughly satisfying. 

This place is a staple, and I can see why. I definitely plan to hit it up again if I ever come back to Montreal (which I hope to!)."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I just got the smoked meat (medium) and french fries and it was such a filling lunch! All the seasonings in/on the meat are so tasty!"}
{"text":"I just visited Montreal last week and had the famous smoked meat here. 
Wow. Just looking into the window, I was like \"Wow! I gotta be in there no matter how long the waiting line is.\" The waiting line was not long because I did not mind sitting at the counter at all. 
I'd had dinner before walking into Schwartz's. I'd thought I would simply had a bite of taste. However, my bf and I finished the whole \"large\" plate of just smoked meat. 
The bread was not good. The meat was terrific. I would love to try its liver steak sometime. I saw it being grilled on fire and imagined how good it would taste. However, I did not like our waiter, who was not friendly and not talented at asking for tips. But the meat scored! I seldom loved pork but loved it done in Schwartz's. So I gave it 5 stars.
By the way, pickles here were awesome too. You have to have pickles going with the smoked meat. 
Before leaving Montreal, we drove there and brought the meat on the road. Luckily, the American customs did allow it to pass the border."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing sandwiches. Cash only (ATM inside) might be a line up on most days and weekends. Don't forget the pickle."}
{"text":"I dream about Schwartz's.....it's that good!!!

The first thing I wanted to eat after I stepped off my 8 hour flight from California was a \"fatty\" smoked meat sandwich and I don't care how long the line was I'd stand in it.  Every single bite is so mouth watering as the meat simply falls apart and the flavors are extraordinary!!  You have your choice of the \"lean\" meat which still has a little bit of fat still but what's the point?  You need to go all out here fatty all the way. Don't forget to order some fries, a cherry coke, and some pickles to complete the meal.  The last time I had Schwartz's was probably a little over ten years ago but I can still remember it vividly.

Thank you Schwartz's for making my trip to Montreal complete!!  Je t'aime!!"}
{"text":"Great deli and so worth the wait in the line! There is a separate line for to-go orders but I highly recommend eating it there. I had the pastrami sandwich with a side of Coleslaw and a Black Cherry Coke. Some of my friends who were with me also got the pickles and the fries with the gravy sauce. Everything was great! Staff are very friendly and have been there for mannnnyy years. Some advice - Bring Canadian Dollars with you!! They accept US Dollars but charge an extra fee! No Credit Cards!"}
{"text":"WHAT?????????  There are many mysteries in life, but  none as inexplicable as this.  Why is there a line outside this place?  Why did the concierge at the Intercontinental urge me to come here?  I just don't understand.  I don't even care that the place looks like a dump of a diner.  That's fine.  It's a cheap meal.  But come on!  The \"legendary\" smoked brisket that they serve is TERRIBLE!!!!  The \"home made\" fries suck!  I mean, there is nothing good about them.  Anyone can but potatos and fry them.  They do nothing to them.  No flavor.  Just blah.  And back to those sandwiches.... what are you people raving about.  Have you guys had a decent sandwhich anywhere? They suck. They are plain bad.  Sure they age and smoke the beef for days, but who cares.  They slap it on boring rhye bread with some cheap mustard.  The beef is just boring.  If I smoke something for 10 hours, you better believe it's going to be one of the most delicious things you've ever tasted.  This was just bad.  We weren't that hungry, so we told the waiter to just bring us one.  He chuckled and said, once you try it, you're gonna want another one because they are small sandwhiches and they are the best.  I insisted on just one to share and we were both very pleased with our decision.  Neither of us finished our piece.  We ran out of there as fast as we could... confused and disoriented as we passed the 30 people waiting in the line outside.  As we walked down the street, we overheard a group of people talking about the place.  They were locals... all were wondering what the big deal was about this place.  I started a conversation with them and we were all in agreement.  Anyway, Montreal is a wonderful place to eat.  Don't waste one of your meals here.  Wow..."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go I'm not a big fan of meat but it was totally worth it. Just perfect! 
They were also really nice to my toddler."}
{"text":"The food is great but let me assure you that this place is not wheelchair accessible.  The aisles are way too narrow for walking customers to pass wait staff let alone having wheelchair or even a cane walker in here."}
{"text":"Great sandwich. Draws immediate comparison to nyc delis but with a French feel except most of the people speak English. Really fun little spot. I got the half fat smoked meat sandwich with cherry cola. It was delicious."}
{"text":"As you might guess from the 1000+ many Montreal natives (not me) consider this place an institution. I believe it's been open since 1928, and the place doesn't look like it's changed much since. This place is definitely into the concept of simplicity=beauty, the signature dish is just a \"smoked meat sandwich\"and includes two unremarkable slices of bread mustard and of course the meat. Other signatures, apparently include the cherry soda, and the pickles. I was told by some Montreal folks that the 3 signature foods here are: poutine, bagels (distinct from the NYC variety), and smoked meat. And apparently Schwartz's is the quintessential smoked meat experience. The service here is good, the folks take their job seriously and are very affable. In any case, if you're eager to check another box during you're Montreal visit give these guys a shot."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich we had was amazing! It was smoked for 8 hours! The coleslaw is also a must, which is prepared in a non traditional way. They use vinegar and the sourness complements the meat so well! 

The amount of meat for a small plate equals 1.5 sandwiches and a larger plate equals 2.5 sandwiches."}
{"text":"Just average.  Although they have a menu, they pretty much only serve one item: the smoked meat sandwich.  When you go just look around and you'll realize that's the only thing anyone orders.  And the waiter tells you that - just get the sandwich.  So we did.  Nothing special.  The bread is plain eye, the meat is bland - I gave it two stars because it's a nice portion.  They didn't offer pickles, there were no special extras, no kraut, just disappointing.  Montreal has much better choices."}
{"text":"We visited late at night but there was still a line. The server told us to stick to the smoked meat (which is brisket) and didn't recommend the turkey or duck so my partner and I both got smoked meat sandwiches. He asked if we wanted lean or fat and we went with fat so the meat was very juicy and tender. If I were to do it again, we should've gone to the take out counter next door and shared one sandwich since it's served with a lot of meat. The cherry cola recommended by Yelpers are from a can and not made in house. I wanted to wash my hands prior to getting my meal but after waiting a while for the bathroom a woman came out and warned me that the toilet is overflowing so I didn't use it. The meat is served over many slices of toast. There was no dripping sauce or mayo so we were able to eat it with a fork. We kept adding mustard to the meat."}
{"text":"The smoked meat is incredible. Why else would people line up in the rain.  I recommend fries, slaw, a pickle, and a coke. A lot of people have the cherry coke but it's not my bag. The stack of meat isn't bad, but it pales compared to the mountain of meat at some of my nyc favs. A bit more meat and five stars for sure. I also went next door to buy some meat to go."}
{"text":"As a local I can confirm that Schwartz is NOT the best smoked meat you'll find in town. However, its reputation is as strong as ever and you can now even find Schwartz in select grocery stores. 

I've eaten here about a dozen times in my life but it has never been my favorite place for smoked meat and the last few years the quality I received was questionable. The last visit consisted of one of the most underwhelming smoked meat sandwich I've ever had the misfortune to eat. My sandwich was dry and very fatty. The flavor wasn't there and honestly it was gross! It's as if they served me a leftover sandwich from other sandwiches so it didn't go to waste. My friend didn't like his as well and his cut was definitely better than mine.

It's simply not worth coming here with recent experiences, the line-ups and the fact I always have to share my table. It's just too much of a hassle for what you get.

Frankly, it's a tourist trap and it's known place for out of towners to seek that \"famed Montreal smoked meat sandwich\" without doing any level of adequate research. 

There are better options in town. Research it."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm biased from growing up near NYC or in a Jewish household (albeit conservative), but Montreal's version of pastrami / smoked meat has got nothing on the real deal in Brooklyn.  After hearing so many rave reviews from family members and friends, I was really expecting to be blown out of the water, but unfortunately I was instead left drowning in disappointment.

The price is probably OK for the buck for their smoked meat sandwich (since they give you so much meat!), but although it's soft and falling apart, it is absolutely fatty and flavorless.  It has nothing special going for it whatsoever with its pound of meat doused in yellow mustard on soggy white sandwich bread.   Even on the outside bark of the meat itself I was searching for some other flavor than some oppressive salt that they used, and found absolutely nothing worth savoring.

Honestly, I don't get it.  Maybe it was better 50 years ago and the hype train keeps it going today, but there's nothing worth your time here.  Go elsewhere and find the actual good food in Montreal."}
{"text":"Schwartz's is a classic. 

Get #4 (the sandwich), maybe a poutine to share, a pickle for an extra kick, and a can of pop for a perfect meal.

Given the popularity of this place, lines can get very long. Best to go off hours to minimize the waits. They also have a to-go counter to the side of the main restaurant which sells the same sandwiches as well as vacuum sealed meat if you're looking to bring some back home."}
{"text":"What hasn't been said, written or discussed about them. I mean this is like review 10,000...

It's the first thing someone says when you get off the plane, train or bus in Montreal, \"make sure you go to get Schwartz's\". With that in mind they're done a pretty good job of keeping it real despite the-times-they-are-a-changing...

They still smoke their own meat in house (and that's a big deal especially with how much they serve), and after trying many other around the city they are and will continue to be the unique one of the bunch. Their meat and the ambiance can't really be compared - mustard and meat juiced hands down. 

The staff have an amazing camaraderie that is very hard to come by in today's world of high turn over restaurant staff. Obviously this place has gotten and continues to get a lot of hype. One the owners is just a tad well known around the world, and yes I'm a fan. Go Celine go.

Huge shout out to the manager, head slicer and staff for being there day in and day out. Even when they could have an attitude of smoked meat 'kindomship', or old school arrogance, they are respectful and humble.

A lean to medium-fat sandwich with a bottle of mustard in one hand, and a Cott black cherry soda in the other - it's a treat and an experience that I still enjoy ... My Expos cap off to them."}
{"text":"There is no other smoked meat out there that is anything like this. If you are ever walking on St Laurent, you will definitely notice this place because of the lineups. The place is like a little diner with old newspapers and pictures framed up on the wall. I find the whole experience to be quite neat.

This place has one of the best smoked meat I have ever had. It is incredibly juicy, tender and flavorful. You can request whether you like leaner meat or 'fattier' meat. Obviously I choose the latter option without shame (I know you are judging me). It is seasoned and 'smoked' to perfection. This is a MUST GO to place is you are not from Montreal. Always order a can of cherry coke if you are ever there to go along with the meal! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tried their featured sandwich, not impressed by the taste. The meat was kinda dry and flavorless, but the pickles and coleslaw salad were good!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic but having had Katz and Carnegie Deli in NYC, portion size was a bit small. My husband and I were encouraged to also get the cherry coke so we did... Meh, not necessary (but I'm not a soda pop person). We came on a Tuesday evening around 10pm, got seated after a minute of waiting, got our food served to us very quickly. Our server sat down and chatted with us for a bit and recommended some other eateries in the area to try out. He even went next door and had the shop stay open for us so we could swing by and get some Portuguese dessert... Now that's good service!"}
{"text":"That smoked meat. Wow. I may plan another trip to Montreal just to eat here a few times. Seriously.

I would fly in before lunch and grab a sandwich straight away. Then maybe somewhere else for dinner.

Then back here the next evening for dinner. 

Like only once a day...I'm not saying I would go overboard or anything. 

If you have not been here and you are a carnivore or omnivore...you must. Vegans and vegetarians...I am sure there is somewhere else you can go around here."}
{"text":"Pretty good but a little overrated, there are actually a lot of other good places in Montreal that serve equally great smoked meat. Get the platter, they will give you bread with it and you can make your own sandwiches. Then you can have a variety of meats rather than just the one. Because it's a little busy, service gets a little neglected but that's because it's extremely crowded. For a popular business, they should update their payment methods."}
{"text":"Long wait to get into the restaurant so we went to the take out counter and ate there.  Staff friendly enough and I walked away with a very tasty smoked meat sandwich on rye.  Didn't disappoint but not a diet for daily consumption if you don't want to significantly step up your exercise routine!"}
{"text":"I'm worried my rave reviews in Montreal will undermine my Yelp rating integrity, but all the recommendations we received have more than lived up to expectations.  People are not joking about Schwartz's!  It's delicious.  We were lucky to experience next to no wait, despite arriving at 12:15 (it helped that it was a Wednesday).  Our waiter was very nice and we both got smoked meat sandwiches (mine with medium fat, his with more fat), shared some fries and one pickle, and each drank a Cott's black cherry soda (recommended by the waiter).  As a lover of Zingerman's in Ann Arbor, I have to especially note that this smoked meat is something special.  I like pastrami every once in a while in the States, but this was a distinctive flavor and the portion size was just right.  I left feeling full but not regretful.

Schwartz's is definitely worth a trek, and even a wait.  And get the Cott's to round out the experience."}
{"text":"By pass the long line waiting for a table and head straight to the takeout counter.  It was worth the stop over. 

Meat was moist and the portions were just right, ie meat to bread ratio was perfect. Get the sweet peppers too, adds a nice acidity to your bite. :)"}
{"text":"If you think that waiting in a line up outside for wonderbread is a good time then Schwartz's is for you!!

The bread stunk. It was 10 dollars for just a brisket sandwich with nothing else so pretty bad value. The Fatty brisket was disgusting and the medium brisket was dry. 

Horrible service. Rush you in, Rush you out. 

This was my least memorable part of coming to montreal. 

Reubens is a much better option in my opinion and guess what, you dont have to sit with complete strangers in this place.   For those wondering what I mean. You dont get your own table, they cram as many people as possible in the place so you sit with people you dont even know."}
{"text":"Amazing! I heard about this place through my AFAR network so I decided to get sandwiches here to go for the outdoor film screening. The place itself is tiny and it's one of the few places in Montreal that I saw had people lining up outside. The smoked meat looked phenomenal as I watched them carve those babies! And they smelled so good I almost felt bad eating them around so many people. The meat is tender and absolutely full of flavor. They smoke it for hours after all. It's the best smoked meat sandwich I've ever had and just writing this makes me salivate over the thought. This is a must-stop for anyone visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"This is a Montreal staple. The food is good but not sure it is worth to wait in line. The inside is small and crammed. If you really wanna eat smoke meat go to their take out store next door. It is quick and efficient"}
{"text":"When Anthony Bourdain endorses your restaurant, it means stupid crowds. 

At 3 pm, there was a huge line outside. Instead of waiting, I suggested going next door to a \"to-go\" counter. There is a counter in the back you can gather around and eat. The menu is a little bit smaller, but if your are coming for their famous smoked beef sandwich, go here! Do NOT wait in line for an hour. Here's why....

The beef sandwich is ok. It's good but not \"I'm gonna stand in line\" good. 

The poutine was good. The cheese curds are very good, better than most. 

In my opinion, it's worth saying you tried it. But it's not worth waiting in line for."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm not a big fan enough for Smoked Meat. I'll admit it, it's far from the best thing in sandwiches format in my opinion it's not even in the top 10. But I think it's a good meal and when you're craving for junk food, KFC might come to your mind but Schwartz's should be the one. It's an honest sandwich with some good meat which is offered thin or medium size slices. The fries are good; home made. Small portion but still it's all about honesty. 

'Cause let's get real! The service is fast and crappy, the waiter looks tired, too old or simply not that clean.  Speaking of which, this place is not the cleanest place ever. If you're the kind of person who's never going to Asia because it's not clean enough for you, well you probably shouldn't stop there.  Like some previous Yelper have mentioned: Really Overated!

Plus: they offer Stewart's soft drink! Oh yeah!! Deli and Stewart's Root beer or Black Cherry soft drink! that's good!"}
{"text":"This is a must visit if you are in Montreal as a tourist. Check out the wiki page for the restaurant. We ordered the smoked meat sandwich and a smoked meat poutine. A friend recommended the cherry coke drink.  There is a separate line and store for takeout. Also a few stools to eat at the back. You can also purchase party platters, smoked meat packages to eat at home, Montreal steak seasoning, etc.

The sandwich was not large, medium fat, moist with the right amount of mustard. The poutine was a large serving size with gravy, cheese curds and smoked meat. With the cherry coke the meat did not taste too salty. 

You order and then pay at the cashier while everything is being made/served. They do take credit card. Overall a great experience well worth the wait (the line moves quickly)."}
{"text":"Yelps rating led me here. It was quoted as being the Katz deli of Montreal. There was no wait for a seat although be prepared to sit with strangers as the size of the seating area is small. The menu is small but chances are that if you visit this restaurant you are there for the smoked meat sandwich. The food was served within 3 minutes of us placing our order. I opted for the smoked meat sandwich and chose poutine as my side. The sandwich was good and the poutine was...ok nothing special. Honestly what I think I enjoyed the most was the Cott black cherry soda that I ordered by mistake because I thought she said coke..After this review I will be searching to see if I can get some sent to me via amazon. One important thing I didn't read in the reviews that I skimmed through is that they don't accept credit/ debit cards. Luckily they have an ATM machine near the restrooms. All in all this is a good place to eat for a minimal amount of $."}

{"text":"Best smoked meat in town. Period."}
{"text":"Go. Just go. 

Visiting Montreal from NY and this seemed like a mandatory stop based on all the reviews.  Having downed a Fairmount bagel about 30 minutes prior, my wife and I split a smoked meat sandwich with a side of fries.  I'm a big fan of Katz's Deli so this was not far off.  We went at 11:30am on a Tuesday so we avoided the lunch rush. (We attempted to go Sunday afternoon and the line was down the block).  

Great place for lunch in Montreal. Don't miss."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Although the sandwiches taste pretty good here, it's a bit overpriced, imo. It's one of those places that's highly overrated and gets crowded too often and has huge line ups to get in."}
{"text":"I actually turned down a job here once because I was worried that if I worked there I might get tired of eating their smoked meat sandwiches after a few months. I now realize that this is impossible. Schwartz's is by far the epidemy of delicatessen - their smoked meat literally melts in your mouth. If it's your first time going I suggest the fat sandwich (if you think you can handle it) , or the medium... getting the lean is a waste of the experience. All in all, there's no wonder this place has been in business for the past 75 years."}

Located on Boul St-Laurent and Avenue des Pins. Paid street parking is available outside this place.

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
I felt like I went back in time because there were so many historic pieces to reminisce the highlights of the business since it opened in 1929. 

[QUALITY] - 3/5
Yes, this was a historic place, but I don't think I like the taste of history. The smoked meat was too salty and dry for me. They claimed the smoked meats had a \"freshness\" but I only tasted spices that marinated the meat. 

[ORDER] - 3/5
- Smoked Meat Sandwich - $9.75: meat was overly spiced and dry, and bread was stale. 

- Poutine - $6.25: On the bright side, this poutine was pretty good. Fries were made of real potatoes, gravy was nice and rich, and cheese curds melted perfectly. 

[OVERALL] - 3/5
I was not a big fan because I don't enjoy dry and high-sodium food. If you're into that, and you are also a meat-lover, then the Smoked Meat Sandwich would be an ideal choice for you!

{"text":"A Montreal legend.  It was a bit of a walk to get there from my hotel, but I got up to the counter and ordered the smoked meat sandwich.  It is a simple sandwich with great flavor.  Amazing."}
{"text":"What can one say or add to the discussion?  Simply the best in Smoked Meat. No argument here!"}
{"text":"I went here in November 2015. There wasn't much of a line when I went there. Their smoked meat was amazing, god tier, as I would say. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Sandwich vraiment simple, service par fois rude, prix exagerer mais la force et l'ame de ce restaurant c'est justement ca. Une montagne de smoke meat entre deux pain de saigle avec de la moutarde et un pickle. Ca passe toujours bien."}
{"text":"True to its TV fame (I first saw this place when Anthony Bourdain ate here on one of his shows) this place is PACKED - I luckily found a bar seating for dinner.

Interestingly enough, an American couple next to me tipped me off saying \"Just get whatever he tells you to get, don't ask anything!\" as the server guy walked by with stoic expression. So what choice did I have? The guy asked if I want the same (as the couple) and I went \"Yeah.\"

Turns out it's Smoked Meat sandwich, dill pickle, french fries, and cherry coke. A lot of food!
The sandwich is just... perfect. So simple but ... so good! When it started being a bit dry their fries and pickle helped. Fries... were the kind of magic fries that are amazing even if soggy... I gather prob due to extra amount of grease? I did not want to know but I ate every last scrap because that fry was EXZCELLENT~ Pickle was good but at $2 CAD... Well. Cherry coke is a MUST with this meal. 

One downside was that I found out later that this is all cash and I obviously hadn't even calculated the total upon ordering! I was $5 short in CAD, but cashier allowed me to pay the rest in USD, which they penalize you a bit against the CAD. Overall, I spent $20 CAD - so while a bit expensive, it was a lot of satisfying greasy bites. 

This one is an easy 5-star."}
{"text":"We sat next to two older gentlemen who recounted the sundry smoked meat sandwiches they ate around the world.  They were just a bit more friendly than our welcoming waiter, who was an inviting version of a server you might meet at Peter Lugar.

Sadly, we were informed that the restaurant was sold...to Celine Dion's husband.  True or false, get the smoked meat medium and then jump across the street for homemade ice cream."}
{"text":"Classic smoked meat spot, just be careful not to trip over all the tourists"}
{"text":"Gave them all my money for a pile of food that is sure to give me a heart attack. 10/10 would do it again.

The takeout line is much shorter than the sitting line, so we opted for takeout and hung with the most charismatic guys behind the counter you can imagine. They steered me away from ordering turkey (nothing but smoked meat when you come here baby) and laughed at our future food coma when we topped it off with poutine and a pickle. 

All of it was epic. Assuming my arteries survive this meal I'm going back for more."}
{"text":"As a standard meatlover?I would give smoked meat 4 stars?the meat is excellent?but I've eaten better meat before?cherry soda if perfect?and pickle?personally?is not so good compared to others' reviews

Overall?it is worth to try?"}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly, went with 3 of my friends and we all had AMAZING service and the food was a little fatty but hell...IT WAS AMAZING TOO!! Had the black cherry cola too EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING! THANK YOU SCHWARTZS!!"}
{"text":"I don't get it, or maybe I just don't have a taste for smoked meat. After hearing all the hype I got a sandwich to go (the line for tables was way out the door and down the street). It seemed small for the price ($10 with a pickle), just meat and bread and that's it, no mustard or anything.

Honestly, it was... bland. About as exciting as eating moist cardboard spread with lard. The pickle was sour and nasty, and there was so little bread to contain the meat that the sandwich fell apart and I had to finish it with a fork. I guess this is how smoked meat connoisseurs like it?

There's a corner store a block down the other side of the street that sells Vietnamese sandwiches for $2 which are easily twice as good."}
{"text":"The smoked meat is better than Katz's! I didn't think it was possible. Ordered \"fatty,\" you will never get closer to heaven. It's so soft and salty, and the bread is nice and soft too. For $6.15... wait, 6 bucks??? NY is a killer on the wallet, it's bullshit that I am even GLAD to pay 15 for a pastrami at Katz's.  Now I have some perspective and want to move to Montreal. 

From across the street, I looked at the line out the door, and didn't want to go - no matter how good it is, I'm not going to wait in line like a bunch of lemmings for a sandwich. THEN, I found that there is a take-out shop next door selling the exact same sandwich - and there's even tables and counters to sit at!  Zero line. How come no one told me about this before???

I have no idea what the classic Schwartz's deli looks like, and I don't care. Schwartz's take-out window gets 5 stars - easily. It blows up the scale."}
{"text":"Known as a tourist trap, but at least it's one that delivers on quality. We did quick serve because the line was too long for a table and had the original smoked meat sandwich. While not my everyday cup of tea it was certainly tasty. The bread was the best part. Soft and yummy. Glad I checked this off my Montréal must do list but I probably won't return unless I'm craving it."}
{"text":"If you've been to NYC and have gone to Katz's Deli, then this will be a similar experience. I do like Katz's Deli better, but I'm sure some people would disagree with me.

This is a pretty typical deli; stand in line, wait, order at the deli, pay as you leave. Simple, quick, no BS. The staff was friendly and knew how to slice meat like professionals. I got the pastrami sandwich. It was small but tasty. The prices didn't seem too bad for a big city either. If I'm in Montreal again, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Ok - so it's pretty good: stacked medium fat pastrami sandwich. It's iconic Montreal. The meat is very good. Decent pickle (but not home made - how hard could that be?). Fries are ok. Maybe the platter with a stack of bread is the better call? You're packed in like sardines and that's part of the experience - hopefully your table neighbor is interesting. We waited 15 minutes - acceptable - but longer than that on a warm day and I'd head to another deli. At the end of the day it's a very good deli sandwich - I wouldn't wait 40 minutes for it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would.  

The ambiance is unique.  The food is classic. I hope this place never changes.  

Totally worth this 5 hour drive to Montreal for schwartz.  

Please expand to toronto!"}
{"text":"Like others, I heard that this place had great smoked meat and that it was a true institution that we had to visit. So we did. We split a smoked meat sandwich and a poutine. Drinks were limited to sodas and some other items. Food was indeed good, but not exceptional. I have had better smoked meat - and much more of it - in delis in other cities. Seating is whoever you can find it, with others at the table. It was packed, but we were seated quickly. The best part was probably our server, who had been there 10 years and had his own act worked out. 

Definitely worth a visit, but not all we expected."}
{"text":"Ah, Schwartz's. It's a rather famous, tiny delicatessen in downtown Montreal renowned for many things-- including being overrated. But when I ate there, I thought it was.. alright. It was the meal I had after my quasi-epic trek up and down Mont-Royal the woodsy way, thus I was prepared for some meat!

The ambience of the restaurant is tiny, grubby, cramped.. yet I couldn't imagine it any other way-- and I do admire the owners' refusals to commercialize the restaurant into a chain. The grubby atmosphere was actually oddly inviting. It was raining heavily the day I went, but there was still a sizable line (plus, it was dinnertime on a Saturday evening), and the wait was about twenty minutes.

I have to admit the wait IS worth it though. The meat was amazing, and nothing like I'd ever had before. The fries and bread were average, and I unfortunately didn't get the pickles.. but either way, the meat was.. indescribably good. I probably could have eaten it forever if I could. It's so hard to put into words that I won't even try-- one must experience it her/himself. It probably isn't the most amazing meat in the world, but it IS pretty good.

The service, however, was questionable. Our waiter was courteous enough, but didn't have a very welcoming attitude, and one of my party got into a small argument with him about one of the fees-- though, nicely enough, he ended up not charging us the fee that we so contested. Still, the service was only okay.

While I must admit that Schwartz's IS a bit overrated.. it is worth going to at least once if you're in Montreal.

Food: 4.5/5
Service: 3/5
Ambience: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Alright, first 5-start review for a restaurant in Montreal.  Little hole in the wall with no character except for the attitude of the wait personel attending to orders.  Tried to order the chicken sandwich and received a friendly but insistent warning, \"you can get that anywhere, don't order this.\"  So I stuck with the smoked meat sandwiches and man, I tell you, what a favor those guys did for me!  Amazing marbling in the ham (some would say all-out fat) marinated in something which gave great flavor.  Meat came out so amazing tender...at the end I contemplated shipping 10+ pounds back to the states but the cashier warned me it couldn't reach past the border.  Only in Canada.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a must when in Montreal. Food and service are 5 stars. There was a line out the door for take out but we were able to be seated at the counter right away for dine in. I had the smoke meat sandwich with side of dill pickle and fries. I can't wait for my next visit to Montreal to have Schwartz's again."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of smoked meat, but Schwartz's definitely made my little heart change for the better!

Coworker went to school at McGill, so he definitely knows his way around Montreal...and he highly recommended that we come here to eat..and boy was I glad that he dragged us into this noisy, janky, cramped, and old diner (I mean this is most rustic way!!). I love the feel of this place! 

We all had the smoked meat sandwich, and I really appreciate that they let you chose the cut of meat: fatty, lean, or half-half. :) 

When our sandwiches arrived, and I bit into my sandwich it was like a chorus of singers sang with joy! The meat was perfectly seasoned, smoked, melt-in-your-mouuuuttth! The bread to meat ratio was spot-on and didn't overwhelm the palate. 

Yes, I love Schwartz. :) Thank you, dear coworker, for giving my stomach that extra push it needed to convert into a smoked meat fan!"}
{"text":"Top quality smoked meat. The best in montreal just by smoked meat quality. 
Their staff is ancient and rude often. The location looks like Star Kabab."}
{"text":"Meat was dry but flavours were definitely there. If you want to skip the line, just do a take out. The long line is the sit down one"}
{"text":"If I wanted surly service and cramped conditions, I'd eat at home. Do yourself a favour: skip the lineups, and walk across the street to The Main Deli and Steakhouse. At least there you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"To be honest I ate there as a kid when my tastebuds knew no better. Paid an okay price relative., went back for the first time 16+ years later. GARBAGE , overpriced ridiculous. Almost 18$ for a pickle and sandwich. Pathetic. Go across the street instead. They are nicer too."}
{"text":"If you are a meat lover then you need to stop by here. For my last spot to eat I wanted something memorable, boy was it worth the drive. They packed the sandwich with a lot of meat. Like everyone states here for this place, the smoked meat is to die for. It was so delicious that I continued to pick off the leftovers from my sandwich. If you are in Montreal, you need to come here!"}
{"text":"The line was long but there are 2 lines to choose from:  Take out or dine-in with 2 different entries.  After 30 minutes of waiting we got our hot smoke meat sandwiches.  It was good but not great. There are part of the meat that is extremely lean (dry).  The fatty part and outside was very nice.  The dry rub used was very good but did not mask the dryness."}
{"text":"Stood in line for 15 min to get in.  The place is packed like sardines.    Probably breaking fire code.   Ordered the famous smoked meat sandwich simple and understated but that is what makes it so good.  Not overly spicy or salty just a perfect bite. No need for extra sides.  One sandwich fills the void and makes you feel great.  Great food.   Worth the experience."}
{"text":"If you plan ahead, and beat the ridiculously long line, you might experience the most flavorful bite of your entire life. The smoked meat sandwich is a fantasy come true. Read about the entire operation on the menu and you'll appreciate each bite. It's delicious with the black cherry cola, dill pickle & slaw on the side. When I was a little girl, I didn't eat meat. The thought of eating an animal freaked me out. The waiter promised my family that if I did like the sandwich, than the meal would be on him. I took a bite and asked for a second sandwich because it was so delicious. That was my first exposure to meat. 
I always hit up this place whenever I'm in Montreal and so should you!"}
{"text":"World Famous Original Smoked Meat with recipe from 1928. Over 80 years of tradition - A Montreal classic. The oldest deli in Canada and a true Montreal landmark situated on Boul St Laraunt - another famous destination!
Be prepared to line up no matter time or day of the week. \"Even if you are Angelina Jolie\" their words not mine. Major tourist site - therefore lots of people wanting to get in. 
At the door you are greeted by one of the servers- can't go in until there's a spot to sit. Once in your seating is based on availability. You may be making friends with fellow tourists or patrons right away- elbow to elbow. You can choose to sit at the front bar like area if there's room. Place is filled with history- check out walls of many news paper clippings. Service is good with funny waiters and they don't mind picture taking in fact they offer to take your picture once the food is placed in front of you.
I'd prob say look up the menu before going so you can make a choice right away- it gets very overwhelming with many people and fast service. We choose the original smoked meat sandwich-very small white bread slices packed with overflowing layers of smoked meat. Your choice for additional condiments. Comes already with a side of huge pickle. There one home style drink- Cherry coke. Other options if not your thing. We ordered side of small fries. Spices on the meat can't go wrong. 
Remember - only take cash so make sure you have that on hand . Also take out and store right beside. Fast service and there's options to take home packaged meat and sauces. 
Best smoked meat I ever had.

{"text":"It's OK. They'll laugh at you if you ask for mayo, that was funny."}
{"text":"Malgré la continuelle file d'attente devant le resto, c'est tout simplement un must Montréalais!"}
{"text":"I like this just as much as Katz's in NYC. The meat is buttery, seasoned, and tender. I'm not a fan of mustard but the mustard wasn't distracting at all in the sandwich. It also wasn't expensive to boot. 

The only negative thing I could think of was the wait in line in the sweltering heat of August. 

I would definitely drop by again the next time I'm in Monty.

In short, OMG SO MUCH MEATY MEAT MEAT *swoon*."}
{"text":"I've lived in Montreal most of my life and always heard great things about Schwartz's but never felt compelled to try... Well I'm glad it finally happened although I still wonder what the hype is all about.

Something about meat, mustard and bread sounds really mediocre and boring to me. Maybe I'm just not a smoked meat kind of person. I've had it just a few times and quite prefer it elsewhere.. coughDunnscough.

It was good, but not worth coming back when there are line ups or worth the hassle of taking cash out when I'm used to dealing with businesses that accept plastic."}
{"text":"Went there with my GF, both of us are deeply touched by the delicious smoked meat sandwich. Waiter is friendly also. Highly recommend it to you all."}
{"text":"Do you ever have one of those experiences that makes you think to yourself \"ok, I can die now, I _____ _____ __ _____.\" That was the thought that entered my head right after I took my first bite, temporarily lost consciousness due to explicit euphoric state, then came back to. 

And as my dear friend Arc P put it in his review below, \"Holy f@$k do they have a wicked smoked meat sandwich!\", yes, yes they do! If you travel to Montreal and do not take the time to stand in line at Schwartz's, well, consider your entire trip a failure! I'm serious; these sinfully good sandwiches are like a trip to Disneyland for your tastebuds. And for the love of all that is holy, order an extra pickle! 

Meat Fantastique!"}
{"text":"No words . Really liked the sandwich . It's so old school and tasty. The guy gave us some stories about the place and it's so interesting."}
{"text":"Une légende et une institution à Montréal. Un peu crampé si on va dans le restaurant et tellement bruyant que c'est pas très idéal pour un souper romantique à deux. Souvent il y a de l'attente, impossible de prendre des réservations afin d'éviter l'attente. La Poutine à la viande fumée est trop bonne!"}
{"text":"I'm from Boston and this is a must have for me whenever I come to Montreal.  The long line will tell you already how awesome this place is.  I come for the smoked meat sandwich extra fatty with mustard.  It's far from healthy but I can't have it any other way.  If only they had a place like this in Boston.  

Price is a little expensive and don't bring the whole gang.  Seating is limited here.  At times I've gotten this to go and  will wash it down with a chilled beer =)"}
{"text":"We had to try Schwartz's like everyone says.  Luckily we did not have to wait in line for a table.  I think we got the last empty seats.  The waiter was horrible.  I know they are busy but we are visiting tourists and we did not understand how this restaurant works, except you need to try smoked meat from Schwartz.  Waiter was very rude and answered our questions with a very smart tone.  Sorry if we didn't know how to order, and I guess you don't have to be nice when you always get a line waiting to eat?

The 4 stars is for the food.  If I had to rate the experience with the waiter, I'd give it a 1 star.

We had gone across to Main's to ask question before deciding on Schwartz, and the person at Main was very nice.  We only went to Schwartz's because of the Yelp reviews and what I read on the internet.  At least the sandwich was good with the pickle and the black cherry soda."}
{"text":"The first time I tried Schwartz's Deli was in 2003 when I traveled to Montreal with a friend.  The restaurant was recommended in our guide book so we decided to give it a try.  When we got there the line was out the door.  We determined that this place must be really good so we waited. When we finally scored some seats we both ordered the classic \"Smoked Meat\" sandwich.  After finishing our sandwiches we both said \"that was one the best sandwiches I ever had\".

Fast forward to 2008.  I was in Vermont last month for a wedding and my husband and I decided to drive to Montreal for the day. I decided since we were in Montreal, I had to have a sandwich from Schwartz's.  We headed there for lunch and as expected the line was out the door.  We waited for about 25 minutes and were seated.  Right away one of the the waitstaff came over and asked for our orders. We quickly ordered the smoked meat sandwich and fries to share.  When you order you have a choice of lean, medium or fatty.  We both opted for medium.  I also ordered a black cherry soda to drink.  The sandwich was as I remembered...tender and filling.  And, the soda was a good accompaniment.

I hope I can make it back to Montreal in another 5 years so I can have this sandwich again.

BTW, I noticed that they are building a take out place next door.  Hopefully, that will probably help with the crowds."}
{"text":"Amazing place, straight forward menu. This place has that vintage ambience when you are sitting here biting your sandwich and looking at the pictures hanging to the wall, you get that sense of fulfilment from inside.
Must visit place in Montreal !
Almost always a line up outside, but its all worth it."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a few locals I met while looking for a bite to eat. They said that this is a must go to place if you are in Montreal.

They're known for their smoked meat sandwich here which come with three different levels of fattiness- Lean, Medium, and Fatty. According to the locals, you're supposed to get the Medium smoked meat sandwich, fries, and the sides of dill pickle, hot peppers and black cherry cola on the side.

Even though I don't have much experience with smoked meat, I have to say I had a very good experience there. The sandwich was on point with the medium fattiness. The hot pepper and dill pickle really compliments the smoked meat well, and the cherry coke just washes everything down perfectly. This is the must get combo if you come here.

Also, I heard that this place hasn't changed much since the 1940's. So if you want to experience some traditional Canadian eats, check this place out."}
{"text":"The smoked beef is amazing! Just the right amount of fat in the medium. The sandwiches are huge- it might make sense to get a plate and share. But it is so so good. Also the restaurant is cash only so be prepared!"}
{"text":"Founded in 1928 and proudly displaying both this fact and their myriad awards throughout the premises much like Katz's in New York the space at Schwarz's was small at cramped at the entryway but with ample seating in back and almost immediately on entering we were greeted in verbose French by the man at the counter who quickly transitioned to English when he registered our blank looks.  With the menu larger than anticipated but the object of our desire displayed prominently the order was placed and asking if we preferred \"fatty\" or \"medium\" I suggested he give us whatever was better and he said \"medium\" before turning to a younger man who prepped and wrapped the sandwich, grabbed a can of Canada Dry, and bagged it for us to pay another young man at the door - the whole interaction took perhaps five minutes before we emerged on the street.

Moving on to the sandwich - three quarters of a pound at least, if I were to guess - I have a little bit of trouble describing exactly what I ate because I really have no reference standard, but with a touch of mustard largely avoided and sampling both the brisket on its own and with the rye bread I have to say it was actually quite good - a supple mouth feel with big notes of smoke complimented by what I believe was mostly peppercorn and coriander plus a slight sweetness that worked nicely with the rye.  While certainly not something I'd crave on a daily basis definitely a worthy place to check out - particularly as the remaining sandwich and a few bagels from down the street served a more than ample dinner costing less than $10 for my mother and aunt."}
{"text":"Good Smoked Meat Sandwich (Pastrami).  I would say this place lived up to the hype, quality product, not much of a wait, and a really tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"would not recommend this place - they have a hidden 12$ card minimum and are totally not negotiable about this. they should be way way more up front!"}
{"text":"Oh-ver-ra-ted. 

I don't get it. It's small, cramped and even the to go line was insanely long. I have no words for the bathroom. Noone is cleaning the bar tables and cleaning/refilling the condiments. The place is not clean. The sandwich wasn't bad but it wasn't \"wait in line for over thirty minutes in the to go line\" good."}
{"text":"If I can give it 10 stars, I would. We went there about 4 o'clock in the afternoon and there was 20 people in front of us. We decided to skip the line and take out. we tried their famous smoked brisket, vinegar based Cole slaw, French fries, and homemade pickle. The smoked brisket was flavorful tender, moist, and delicious. It'll run you nine dollars for a sandwich and it's a pretty small sandwich I wouldn't share it. Because the meat is so much they wrapped it in three slices of bread with just a little mustard dressing. French fries were soggy but I think that's how the French like it. Loved the coleslaw skip. Skip the soggy sour pickle."}
{"text":"We knew it would be good when we arrived at 3pm on Sunday afternoon to find a queue of people 20 deep.  The staff did an excellent job of moving the line and getting people into the restaurant.  We were seated within 20 minutes.  The smoked meat sandwiches were outstanding.  The rye bread and the right spread of mustard perfectly complimented the smoked brisket.  I couldn't stop eating.  I had to force myself to take a break after I inhaled the first half of my sandwich.  The extra-sour pickle was just what I needed to take a pause.  The fries were extra crispy and tasted home-made.  The waiter was exceptionally nice and super calm with the chaos all around.  The whole family was thrilled with lunch!!"}
{"text":"Amazing smoked beef. Wow. I've been to Katz's Deli,Carnegie Deli, and even Harolds in NJ. This stacks up with all of them. Honestly, when you hit way above average, it's tough to judge which one is the best.

It's about $10 CAN for a sandwich which is pretty cheap and you can also get it by the pound. We got sandwiches to go about every day we were in Montreal. It's a great snack and they are open late as well.

Definitely one of the bucket list items when you are in Montreal. Each Poutine and Schwartz's. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars...

Like Christopher M., we also made the pilgrimage to Schwartz's after the numerous guidebook references and raves about the place as an institution and *the* best deli in Montreal to get smoked meat.

We waited in line for around 20-30 minutes on a fine May morning.  We finally got in and were waved to 2 seats in the back of a flourescent-lit no frills very smokey-cloudy room packed nose-to-elbow with long, narrow tables.  You are in essence, sharing a table of 6 with other parties, if you arrive and wish to be seated as a pair.  Be prepared to leave smelling of smokey meat.

We timidly ordered a smoked meat sandwich each, along with a side of pickled cabbage salad.  The smoked meat was tasty -- tender and juicy with just the right amount of fat...  We looked in awe at our table companions, who appeared to have ordered the Schwartz Combo: an artery-clogging platter of entrecote steak, a hunk of smoked meat and sausage, accompanied by fries and cabbage salad.  They washed it down with cans of Schweppes club soda.  And yes, they did not share -- each of them had 1 Schwartz Combo ($16.95). 

Perhaps we'll be more adventerous next time and will opt for such a platter... to share, of course."}
{"text":"This place kicks NYC smoked meat ass! I am a big fan. Don't wait in that stupid line. Go to the take out door and get your fix ASAP!"}
{"text":"The staff were friendly, helpful and with a good sense of humor. There was short wait outside to get in for our Monday lunch.  The place is pack for good reason. You must try this place if you are visiting Montreal. The fatty smoked corned beef is awesome, perfectly seasoned. Never had it so good. The ambiance is basic. Why wouldn't be? It's a deli. Just a great feel to it.
There was not much to not like about this place. My only dislike is, they are in Montreal and I live in North Vancouver."}
{"text":"Never thought I would enjoy smoked meat between two pieces of bread so much. Very unpretentious and friendly atmosphere. Perfect place to go to if you are eating on your own for a quick meal or to grab a sandwich to go. The smoked meat is moist and flavourful. The sandwich is the perfect size and very filling. This is definitely a must go to kind of place if you are visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Personally, I didn't want to go here even after I read many positive reviews but my friend urged to go.  So I bought a corned beef sandwich for about $10.  It was much smaller than the one I had from  Katz's in NYC.  This was nothing special.  I wonder if Reuben's were any better.  Not worth the trip for a tourlist.  The chef who makes the sandwich didn't look so happy either."}
{"text":"Montreal has an incredible food scene. That's not much of a secret. Ate at Scwwartz's two years ago in February. Just found this unpublished review in my drafts. 
It was an unusually cold winter. Ice skating at the municipal rink, eating dumplings in China Town and enjoying the steamy roasted meat sandwich here helped keep us warm. 
Clanking dishes, plastic cups with crushed ice, cherry soda, huge pickles, laminated original menus, being greeted by an older fellow in a paper hat, all original booths and counters/ stools. These are the things that cause an original \" diner\" and Jewish Deli ( remember Wolfie's in Miami?) to put a giant grin on my face! Get it while it's still there."}
{"text":"I think this one is a no brainer for any tourist.

The sandwich is so simple. Bread, mustard, then the intimate part of the sandwich, the smoked meat. Juicy, succulent, flavourful. I have to order 2 because it just tastes so damn good.

Unless, for some reason, you have a bad experience on the service side of things, you will not regret coming here. Your taste buds will be partying in your mouth for days and then they'll be sad when the party stops."}
{"text":"Fooood Pornnnnn!

This is the most accurate description of this place I can give you. After a colleague gave the strongest recommendation possible, we headed over here for a dinner after arriving in Montreal.

Simply put, this is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The meat literally melts in your mouth and you can even choose the level of fattiness that you want. I went with the medium fat meat sandwich which comes with a coating of mustard... Good lord... That's all I can say.

If you add more mustard to the sandwich, it takes things to another level. The kick from the mustard along with the juiciness of the meat makes for an unbelievable taste. I also got a side of cole slaw that was equally delicious.

The meat is already prepared and comes out within five minutes of ordering it. It's a mom and pop type of restaurant that can get a little cramped, but is well worth it. It's also shared seating, so you'll likely be sitting next to strangers at your table. Also worth noting, they only take cash.

This is one of those places that you have to try once in your life. It's truly an experience you won't forget."}
{"text":"There is something wrong with Schwartz's on the societal level. I mean, it is more of a feeding troth than a Jewish deli, per se. The sheer volume of meat that is consumed in this place on a daily basis is staggering. At one point, I saw a garbage bin sized food-grade container being carried by two large, struggling men from the kitchen to behind the counter, full of the famous smoked meat. I watched each cut, nearly 200 lbs. worth, be unloaded out by fork, and be given the final pinch test for tenderness. Some were segregated to an insulated container to continue softening, some were ready for temporary sequestration before slicing. The meat then goes to the workspace of a very fat man with a messed up eye, whose sole job is to slice the meat, which he did with a rhythmic panache, his jaw swaying agape in a chewing motion, almost davening with each cut. An older fellow then slowly makes the sandwiches with rye bread and mustard, his hands pressing them into the well-worn plates with a tender push, the meat fat still jiggling off the sides, mesmerizing the packed-in customers under its tender, pink, shiny spell. 
     The meat just doesn't stop at Schwartz's, all day or all night, and I can't help but mourn for the arteries of the obese and nostalgic clientele who frequent this place."}
{"text":"The greatest deli sandwich ever conceived. Without parallel. Don't call it pastrami, it's \"smoked meat\". But honestly, there is no equal. Katz's in New York City is supposed to be the closest thing, but when I was there I was always thinking \"this is good, but it's no Schwartz's\". I have a hard time describing the joy of this sandwich. Think of a pastrami sandwich, think of it being the most perfect, most tender, juiciest meat, with the great rye bread, pickles, and quality mustard. This is the standard-bearer.

Other than that, Schwartz's is a cool experience. Think of the ultimate New York Jewish Deli, then Quebec-ify it a little bit. That means it's cleaner, friendlier, slightly french, but still just as Jewish. I could go into some comically wonderful experiences I had with some customers here but the un-PC stereotype fulfillment would be unfit for the Internets so I won't. 

I also highly recommend getting the jumbo pickle. It's a must in a deli like this, and this one's really good."}
{"text":"Schwartz's had a pretty sizable line when I went here with my bf, but it was worth the wait :) It's a small-ish place, but there were a lot of tables inside (close together so you're practically sharing with other people, but that's not big deal) - the wait wasn't two bad for just two people, but I expect the wait can be long if you're in a group of 4 or more. (There's also takeout if waiting isn't an option for you). The smoked meat sandwiches are huge and oh so good - I want one now just thinking about it. My bf and I shared a sandwich and a smoked meat plate (similar, but without the bread I guess). The staff were friendly too, which is a bonus on top of an already great place :)"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times but always go for the smoked meat sandwich and pickle. The service here is quite busy but surprisingly quick. If you go there with your friends and just wanna grab a sandwich for lunch during the summer, I would recommend you not waiting for the long long queue but go for the take-away. It's super quick and convenient, and you can also have it in the grassland of the royal mount which is quite close to the store."}
{"text":"Respectable.  Katz's and Carnegie Deli has Schwartz's by a mile but quite frankly I'm glad that there are other cities where Jewish diaspora has immigrated too.  

This is after all the story of Jewish immigration.  Kudos for Montreal.  They are indeed lucky.  It's rare to have something that I almost exclusively think of as a New York thing in other cities! 

I'm going to go back to enjoying poutine fried in duck lard now which is something you can't get in NYC!"}
{"text":"This is a Smoked Meat Mecca.  Whenever back in the ol' hometown, this is the one place I never miss.

The first, the best, even though its owned by Celine Dion (I truly hope they dont mess this up like they did with Nickles).  I always bring back a few pounds to Calgary, and always will.

I can go on about the meat, the taste, the legend, but I think the 300+ positive reviews and the ever present line ups at the door really says it all.

Miss you Schwartz!  Be back soon!"}
{"text":"There was a line even around 4pm on a Sat! Do yourselves a favor and walk next door to the take-out storefront and get it to go! 

That's what we did and there was still a line, but it moved MUCH faster. We got the smoked meat sandwich and shared it because neither of us was that hungry. We also got an order of the fries... because we just HAD to!

This place is really no-frills and just about the sandwich. They're a bit on the small side IMO, but there is a lot of meat! The meat itself is pretty tender and good, but it's not AMAZING. I know that I needed to have something different or else I would get tired of the sandwich. Thus, it's a solid three stars!

The price is also really reasonable so I guess if you're really hungry just buy more sandwiches and you won't break the bank! Employees here are super friendly, but moved a tad slow..."}
{"text":"usually when i see the words 'mystery meat' on a menu i would drop one star and run in the other direction.

inversely, when i see 'schwartzs deli\" on a sign for duh, a deli, i give 4 stars and head in for some kosher goodness.

so, the reality is that this place has been round forever, and it sure as hell looks like like, however, it also can be said that its around cause the deli is the real deal. katzs...well, ok, its not a deli youd find in the heart of Manhattan, but hey, thats a good 7 hours south."}
{"text":"When looking for the must -go places in Montreal, you will definitely come across this place. We waited in line for a bit before we figured out that if you were getting takeout, you could just go in to the counter. Small place with only a few tables so if you're only a couple, you'll get seated with strangers. The sandwich itself had like a 3:1 meat to bread ratio, making it a good value but hard to eat and hold, since the bread is thin, commercial bread slices. The sandwich is automatically made \"medium fat\" if you don't specify otherwise and has mustard on it. Not sure exactly what it is, but it's kinda like corned beef but on the dry side. We didn't understand the hype."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I buy into the hype. I mean it's good, but it's nowhere near the best sandwich i've ever had. The sandwich is stacked with meat but could have used more mustard. I like it but i don't love it."}
{"text":"A stranger in an elevator in NJ told me about this place and 3 days later on a Friday afternoon I drove to Montreal to see if she was lying. 

She wasn't. 

The brisket is moist and disintegrates when you try to pick it up with a plastic fork.  I didn't get the bread but it didn't look like anything to write home about. 

I did what people in front of me did and ordered the $2.50 pickle -- you can skip that.  You're welcome. 

Also ordered a pepperoni stick and hot cherry peppers.   They were OK.   Not bad,  not great; they were, like the pickle,  exactly what they purported to be.  

Didn't get the fries (because you know,  carbs and such), but they were fresh cut and looked awesome.

I highly recommend this place if you like meat!"}
{"text":"Great food, but the overall service and experience was lacking. Long lines and the exchanges with servers feels rushed and insincere. The sandwiches are good, but I'd opt for the take-out online next time."}
{"text":"Les sandwich du restaurant Schwartz's sont souvent sec et petit.  La place offre un service de merde et on attend des heures dehors mais le prix est relativement bas. Personnellement je n'aime pas cet endroit et je crois que c'est une attrape touriste. J'ai personnellement goûté à des meilleurs sandwich à la viande fumée à des places beaucoup moins connu à Montréal."}
{"text":"Gambling involves big risks for big rewards - a description of my experience with this deli. I've been to Schwartz a couple of times and most visits presented me with a juicy fat-gushing sandwich. Despite offering very good smoked meats, I'll explain you why I'll never return. 

Like always, I order a fatty smoked meat sandwich but during recent stops my sandwich was more than sad. It was dry sad. How can the fattiest option for a sandwich be Sahara dry? Both my girlfriend's and mine had dehydrated boards of meat. I asked the waiter why these barks of protein are so dry. He responded with \"Oh it's normal\". Just because I'm asian it doesn't mean that I'm a tourist. The meat was no different from eating leftover chicken breast that was nuked in the microwave - texture wise. A copious amount of mustard had to be added to lubricate the food. It seemed like the sandwiches had leftover or bad pieces of meat in them. They even had the audacity to sprinkle 1/3rd of my sandwich with meat croutons that were probably fallen crumbles from slicing this morning's meat. It was clearly not fresh as the meat was almost black and had a shiny hard shell very similar to beef jerky. I've had the same sandwich numerous times before and the quality has never been this terrible to the point where it's comparable to the STM winter services.

I shit you not, I was so dissapointed that I had to make a stop to the nearby Second Cup to cleanse my palette with a brownie. Excellent service at that coffee shop by the way. Shout out to the tattooed redhead girl and the hipster janitor for bleaching the bad experience for us. 

If you're willing to gamble $10 for a sandwich don't be surprised if your money and your meal goes down the drain. 

To the guys at Schwartz: I've literally had juicier beef jerky at Couche Tard. We can all laugh about this review but seriously, get your shit together. No girls would enjoy their meat dry."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich was great, as was the poutine. Loved the deli atmosphere and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, cramped space because they try and get as many people in as they can, but that just means it's quality because they have soooo many people lined up as well. They are always booming always serving the best quality!"}
{"text":"You must try this place once in your life. The best smoked deli meat sandwich there is! Get pickles on the side. Meat is tender and gawd damn delicious!"}
{"text":"Smoked meat was on the menu of must-try foods while in Montreal.  I like pastrami, and corned beef (although maybe twice a year), and so I knew I'd be cool with a smoked meat sandwich.  

It's kind of a far walk from the Mont Royal station, but I got some required souvenir shopping in as there are tons of boutiques and spots to do stroll around in.  I was heading to the airport that afternoon, and so wanted to take this sandwich to-go to unwrap at the airport and grub - because my airline did not offer any free snacks for a six-hour flight.  I answered back with Schwartz breath. 

Walked in and there was a short line, but the restaurant's seating area (which is minimal but still enough..  though you'll be stuffed like a sardine) was quite full.  They are very fast to service, and you pay and are out the door in a matter of less than 5 minutes (Wednesday around maybe 2pm?)  I asked for \"medium fat\", as that's what I'd been suggested to do.  I don't think they cared, and medium fat is probably the default.  

Anyway, I unwrapped it at the airport a couple of hours later, and although the paper wrapping and bag were soaked with some grease, the sandwich itself was not greasy.  It wasn't glistening with oil.  The grease was just from the natural fats that are melted into the meat itself, and not dripping really - since it's a dry meat.  I think it was on a mild rye toast and slathered in mustard.  Yum!  The meat is sliced medium.. and perfect for just grabbing a chunk out of your sandwich and eating with your fingers.  Yes, us Californians have no shame.  

I think it was around $7?  Great deal, lots of meat (and I mean like maybe 2\" of meat stuffed into the sandwich), and you won't feel too heavy afterward.  I like!"}
{"text":"When in Montreal...you've got to try the smoked meat sandwich at Schwartz's. There might be a line out front, but it goes fast and you are quickly shuttled to a table.

The normal thing to order here is a smoked meat sandwich, lean or medium fatty (I got medium) and a Cott's Black Cherry soda. I recommend just going with the flow and ordering it - there's a reason that's what they're known for. The sandwich is served on rye with mustard...and that's all it needs because the meat is so flavorful. I really enjoyed the soda and got it on every visit. We did split an order of fries for the table, which were fine - but really the sandwich is the star here.

I see people comparing this to the Katz's pastrami sandwich in NYC, and personally I'd rather have Shwartz's smoked meat sandwich - I just love the spices and while it's plenty filling, it isn't piled so high that you can't eat it comfortably."}
{"text":"Went around 11.30 AM, a lot of space. DELICIOUS. I was thinking that it was a tourist trap but no sir!! As if the smoked meat isnt enough, the mustard and the rye bread is amazing too. I got fries and a pickle but only got to finish half of each because I was enjoying the sandwich soo much!"}
{"text":"Its a good jewish deli. They looked at me and my wife kinda funny and surprised, we are muslim, so i can understand their surprise. 

We ordered the lean smoked meat, it was really good. I recommend to go medium fat as its probably juicer and not as dry. The sandwich came out hot and tasty. Other than the asian group of guys chomping with their mouths wide open like a heard of carnivores cattle i recommend trying this place at least once. Not bad for a $9 sandwich."}
{"text":"This update is reviewing the take out section of Schwartz's.   After waiting in  line for about 25 minutes inside the tiny take out store I ordered a smoked meat sandwich for 6.30 Canadian.  I wanted to get a 1/2 sour side pickle, however, none were 1/2 sour and you had to buy two at 1.50 Canadian.  The sandwich was okay.  The meat was a little dried out and was only luke warm.  It seemed like it had been sitting around too long.  The other thing was seeing hunks of cooked smoked meat stored in a large plastic garbage can was unappetizing.  After memories of a delicious meal years ago in the restaurant next door, I was pretty disappointed.  The restaurant had a very long line so that is why I got take out."}
{"text":"If you order just the meat, you get thicker slices than the sandwich. Tastes amazing regardless!"}
{"text":"When in Montreal it's almost mandatory that you track down some smoked meat. It would be like going to Texas and not having BBQ.

Schwartz's is a Jewish Delicatessen serving smoked meat among other things. The interior is simple with many wooden tables placed closely together. It appears that the restaurant is almost always packed. We only had to wait a few minutes before being seated however.

Since we had dinner reservations later that night, we decided to just eat lightly.

We had the smoked meat sandwich which was piled high with thick slices of fatty brisket. The sandwich is relatively simple with the only condiment being mustard. The meat has a definite \"beefy\" flavor with extra richness from the nice fat cap. The mustard helps to cut through some of the fattiness however.

It is also hard to go to Canada without having poutine. The French fries were nicely crisp, topped with squeaky cheese curds and smothered in gravy.

The meal at Schwartz's Deli definitely hit the spot. I would like to try other smoked meat restaurants the next time I am in Montreal in order to see what else is out there."}
{"text":"After trying many places for smoked meat, this is still the best place in my books. I had a large plate of their smoked meat ($17.80) and it was melt-in-your mouth kind of good. My friends and I waited about 45 minutes to get in during lunch time, and I was not disappointed. The interior has a classic vibe to it and everything happens fast; service and eating. I can't wait to go back to Montreal for this."}
{"text":"Everyone we talked to talked up Schwartz, telling us it was worth the visit. And boy were they right. The smoked meat sandwich was simple but was the flavor was tremendous. Each bite was as mouth wattering as the last and next. 

The location is easy to get to and the staff is awesome. The food was equally accessible. I want to thank everyone who had recommended this place.

Also for what it is worth... get more than one pickle they are the best."}
{"text":"This place is a Montreal institution serving smoked meats for almost a century. There's a reason why it's been doing so - it tastes good.

I had the classic smoked meats sandwich. It's a lot of meat for very little bread and I suppose that's why North Americans love such places, but my European palette would have loved a bigger trenche du pain and mibbe some peppers, onions and tomato in the mix.

That said the staff were friendly and it tastes good. So alls well that ends well. I'm glad I went."}
{"text":"A bit overrated. There's always a long line, and the people who work there always assume that everyone is a tourist, and tackily remind you that it's customary to tip"}
{"text":"The montreal classic: medium cut with a black cherry cola.

It's obviously a little overblown: there are other good delis in the city (Lester's, dunn's) but if you're stumbling down St-Laurent and there's no line-up, jump in there.  It's a little expensive for what you're getting though, mostly because it has become a tourist attraction.

It is still amazing that this place is STILL CASH ONLY, even after having been purchased by Angelil-Dion."}
{"text":"Best Smoked Meat in Town!

If you're in Montreal and only have enough time to eat at one place, it HAS to be this one!  Locals and tourists alike line up to eat here.  The service is quick, the food is simple, and for deli fare it's probably the best you've ever tasted.  It's crowded and loud, but that only adds to the ambiance.  

A sandwich, pickle, and soda will set you back just over $15, but be warned, they don't accept credit cards, this is a cash-only establishment."}
{"text":"This is a true \"Montreal Landmark\" that I return to year after year. In fact, a visit to Montreal is not complete, with at least 2-3 visits to this place. I have to confess, I have actually visited Schwartz's more than once in a single day. 

The staff is amazing. They are true masters/professionals of their craft. Ask for \"Mike\" - He's the best waiter there. He will ensure that you get an amazing sandwich.

Don't be a \"Putz\" and asked for something stupid like a sandwich on white bread. Do your research before walking in. Don't come with a large group. Come alone or with another person. Vegans stay away! Do yourself a favor, avoid if your \"Partner\" is a Vegan - this isn't the place for them. 

This is truly one of my favorite places of all time. I've had to slow down a bit ;-) so I pace myself. The Cott's Black Cherry Soda is amazing. Make sure you pair it off with your sandwich.

I have to tell you, things have truly taken a turn for the worst in Montreal; but - despite this - Schwartz's remains strong!

You won't be disappointed! Avoid the crowds! - Go late! ;-) Ask for \"Mike!\""}
{"text":"We got there around 2pm and had to wait for around 20 minutes. Totally worths the wait! Though it's quite crowed and you may need to share table with someone, but the service was amazing and food was delicious. Just in case you don't understand the menu the typical \"smoke meat sandwich\" is number four on the wall."}
{"text":"What can I say? I always make a point to get a smoked meat sandwich here when I visit and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Although the meat sandwich was good at Schwartz's and the price was reasonably cheap, I'm going to compare this place to Katz deli in NY because I expected very similar experiences for what delis are to me. Side-by-side, there was more variety of sandwiches and sides on Katz deli's menu, and the seating was much roomier.  As a tourist, I'd rather wait 30min in line at Katz than at Schwartz."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great environment.  Don't think I'll be writing a long review since we were only in here for 20 minutes, but overall the place left a very good impression.  

The sandwich was great: nothing extraordinary, just good quality meet, some bread and mustard.  The cole slaw was also very good (mostly cause they used olive oil and vinegar instead of may) and the pickle was very zesty.  The atmosphere was a very traditional Jewish deli and, despite the long line and cramped seating area, the crew did a good job in keeping everyone moving and at the same time not rushing. 

While I like the simplicity of the sandwich, I think that's also its one drawback.  I think I've been spoiled on the deli front with lots of flavorful and unique sandwiches, which had both high quality meets as wells as blends of condiments and vegies.  

If you're in Montreal, definitely go here.  I know if I ever come back, Schwartz's will almost certainly be a destination to revisit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went into this place with high hopes. 
The smoked meat sandwhich was described as, \"extremely delicious and of a generous portion of meat\" according to Andrew Zimmerman on Bizarre foods. 
Though, my boyfriend and I were extremely disappointed when trying the sandwhich. Yes it was a generous amount of meat, but that's because you pay the price for the meat. It wasn't a deal at all. It was overpriced and definitely lacked on flavour, toppings, and sauce. The really cheap quality, sliced bread used was too weak to keep the sandwhich intact. Also, the place had the audacity to charge $2.50 for pickles and other extra toppings. What a rip-off! We ended up paying $22.00 for 2 very mediocre sandwiches that could be made in our house in less than 5 minutes. Never coming back to this tourist trap!"}
{"text":"Very popular amongst tourists and locals, partially because Céline Dion bought this place out of her love for their smoked meat, Schwartz's is a must-go Montreal foodie destination located at Plateau of Mount Royal. There is always a lineup in front of the place and it is actually plain-looking, I wasn't expecting to see some many people going crazy for this place (same goes for Kazu in downtown), but in fact, Schwartz's is immensely successful and worth a try.

Personally I am not a big fan of salty meat, but Schwartz's makes very juicy smoked meat and the saltiness can be balanced by bread or other accompanying dishes. Go get a try! Like it or not, it is the most popular smoked meat of the whole city!"}
{"text":"This place is great. People will tell you that you can get the same thing elsewhere without waiting in line, but I disagree. Schwartz's has the best smoked meat I've tried in Montreal. You can also go to their take out door and bring all the ingredients home to make your own sandwich. I like to order a half sour pickle and their spicy peppers to go with the sandwich. And go for the medium. Yum."}
{"text":"Awesome smoked meat!! So good!!  The staff was very helpful and friendly!!  Will definitely be coming back to this place next time!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try the infamous Montreal smoked beef.  Unfortunately, the meat was dry, the price high for what you get but most of all, the waiters were very rude.  Tip reflected the experience and the cashier had the gall to complain! I know your restaurant is popular now but stay humble guys, you never know when things are going to change."}
{"text":"Of course, once in Montreal, Schwartz is a must! Although there was a huge line up it did not stop us from getting some smoked meat sandwiches. The line moved fairly quickly and it was pretty neat to see the chefs in action compiling sandwiches and frying them fries. 

We got a smoked meat sandwich and a poutine. The smoked meat sandwich was quite messy to eat. An abundant of meat stuffed right in between two small fragile slices of bread covered in mustard. A very simple sandwich yet very delicious and filling! The meat was very, very VERY tender. The BEST smoked meat I've had yet! I wasn't too crazy for the poutine.. Fries were on the soggy side however, gravy was good. I mean, Schwartz is largely known for their smoked meat after all.. 

Although it's a very tight and compact space, you will find seats at the back and also a bulletin board to leave a message! (Mine is there!)"}
{"text":"Do not, I repeat, do not, leave Montreal without having some Schwartz's. 
Simplicity reaches perfection at this place. I get the same thing every time I'm there, smoked meat sandwich, medium fat, with dill pickle and salade de choux (coleslaw) on the side with a coke.  
Do expect a lineup outside."}
{"text":"We had a good time and enjoyed our meal.  I'd go back, but it wasn't earth shattering to me based on so many reviews.  It's a landmark tho....so....I guess you have to go."}
{"text":"Really good, family had the smoked meat sandwich and steak dinner plate. Side dishes are pretty big, coleslaw was delicious. Smoked meat sandwich was great, steak was good, but not great. BE AWARE, they don't take credit cards, cash only. Overall good experience and the server was very nice."}
{"text":"Smoked beef, dilled pickle and poutine.  Yes, you can call this a little place in heaven.  Even though there was a line, it moved quickly.   The smoked beef (which is essentially pastrami) was smoked very well.  It wasn't salty and had excellent flavor. Also, the sandwich wasn't a mile high and wasteful like you see in NYC. The poutine was also very tasty and my daughter and I really enjoyed the pickle.
CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place I had to stop by for a smoked meat sandwich. The food is OK but not worth the price charged. Small sandwich is $10 bucks which would not be so bad but they charge you 2 bucks for a single pickle and 2.50 for a diet coke. 

Overall your money is spent far better elsewhere."}
{"text":"OK, so yes, this is a tourist trap, but damn, it's worth it.  This was the best brisket I have ever had.  Be prepared to wait (!).  Surprisingly though, it was very quite inside - I guess everyone was too busy noshing on the outstanding food to say anything.  Cash only. A top 5 five 2014 experience - definitely."}
{"text":"Yelpers told us to go here. My brother told us to go here. So how could we refuse?

We had a large group, but we did not mind splitting up because yeah, smoked meat from Montreal is worth it.

Another fond childhood memory of my aunt bring us smoked meat once every few years. We HAD to have smoked meant and when in Rome (or Montreal), you want the best there is.

Schwartz's is GOOOOOOD. They are not stingy with the meat and they are spot on with the prices. I generally do not enjoy peppercorns, but they prepare the meat in such a way that they only add to the flavor.

I ordered my sammie with a black cherry coke, just as fellow Yelpers had advised. Normally, I'm a diet soda kinda gal... would rather save my calories for the main course. But today was a special day, and boy, that black cherry soda really topped off my sammie.

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because my Canadian companions were not as thrilled as those of us from the States who had smoked meat on a pedestal since long before we crossed the border."}
{"text":"My partner and I couldn't wait to try Montreal's famous smoke meat at Schwartz's. The interior design and menu was just as if they opened up back in 1928. Cash only. 

We ordered their smoked meat sandwich and fries. The smoked meat was absolutely delicious. The meat wasn't too dry, it was soft tender with the right amount of flavours. The bread was interesting - it was like sour bread? I'm not sure, but it paired well with the meat! The sandwich was huge - I could only finish half of it. 

I think our waiter made our experience even better. He was very kind and funny. 

We would come back again without hesitation."}
{"text":"Ya. It's pretty dang good.

The legend is true. This meat is freaking awesome. Usually I'll take lean over fatty meat, but at Schwartz's, it's all good. Pickle was good too. Cole slaw and fries were meh. We waited about half an hour, but it was totally worth it. I thought about buying some to take home, but I think it would dry out. I guess I'll have to go back...

Tips: Skip the line, take it to go!"}
{"text":"Understandably an institution.

I went with a large group on a rainy day and was able to avoid the rumored long lines as we escaped the summer humidity for a very much anticipated dinner. We all ordered the #4, and I ordered the fatty while some ordered the regular and one person the lean. After sampling them all, the regular makes sense for most customers. I wanted the rich indulgence of the fatty but it hasd a lot of fat and on return visits, I'd stick with the regular (the lean was too dry for my tastes). But all in all, just a lovely sandwich. 

I also washed it down with a black cherry soda. I was told that this was their go to drink, but since it came in a can, I was a little bit bummed that it wasn't more of a soda fountain experience. We ordered pickles (great), cole slaw (I prefer mayo-based to vinegar-based slaws but this was a good one in the acidic vinegar category) and cherry peppers (awesome). It was such a fun time and I'm glad we caught it when we did. 

Now this might be hearsay, but it is not my favorite pastrami sandwich ever. I'm still partial to my hometown favorite of Langer's in Los Angeles (I know, a crazy place for my particular smoked meat starlet) but without a doubt, Schwartz's is up there for me with some of the all time great sandwiches I've had."}
{"text":"This Montreal institution is the ONLY Pastrami place that I've ever been to that offers an option of \"lean\" meat, which I greatly appreciate. Lean meat sammie, french fries, a pickle and some fancy-town black cherry cola rocked me, Amadeus.  I also can dig on the communal tables and the fact that you can get in and out pretty quickly...which seems to be hard to come by in Montreal...or I'm really just a New Yorker. The duder that served us up was old skool and really helped with the throw-back vibe, as did the seemingly total disregard for portion control. Sandwich is an understatement. They should call it a 'pastrami mountain'. That being said, you got it all over Katz's, Schwartz's. Yeah, I just said that."}
{"text":"Very good pastrami!!!! Wish they added a soup to their menu especially for the cold winter time. I shared a small platter and an order of poutine with one other person and was enough to satisfy but not full. They have a takeout next door incase you don't want to wait in line."}
{"text":"Restaurant is rundown and dirty - there were crushed fries on the floor, mustard bottle was oily.  Smoked meat (even the lean cut) is way too fatty and greasy, we left huge chunks of fat in our plates. Bread was soggy from all the grease. That place is all hype and no substance. Finally, they have a \"cash only\" policy so they can squeeze an extra percent or two of profit out of the system. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I really like the taste of \"dirty\" smoked meat with pickles and mustard here. It is a must for you if you 're visiting Montreal. You won't eat smoked meat at other restaurants if you know the real taste of it. They  are just jokes..."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh-mazing!!! We walked 20 minutes in the freezing cold to try this place. It was well worth it. I got the smoked meat sandwich with a pickle, fries, and a cherry coke. Definitely hit the spot. We even bought some meat to take back to California. The staff was very friendly and welcoming! We loved it!"}
{"text":"Lean Montreal beef sandwich was some of the best quality brined/smoked brisket i've ever had. If you're getting your order to go like I did, don't wait in line outside like I did, walk right in and order. Cash only. They take American dollars so i got lucky.This place is le bomb!"}
{"text":"For my very first Yelp review, I HAD to start with my experience at Schwartz's. Being from the states I never heard what a \"Schwartz\" sandwich was and probably would of kept walking past this place had I not noticed the never-ending line formed on the sidewalk. After gathering my bachelor party group together, we made our way in the formation for their full-service restaurant. Soon after an employee came out and shouted their \"to-go\" location was open for those who didn't want to wait to be seated so we jumped over and made our way in. 

The place was an assembly line with people wrapping throughout the 1200-1400 square foot space while the employees worked feverishly hoping to keep up with the high demand of their famous Schwartz sandwich. We waited in line for about 15 minutes and viola! Our sandwiches were ready and we were excited to see what they were all about. 

These sandwiches were what I would compare to a corn beef sandwich on marble-rye bread with mustard and they were heavenly! We all enjoyed them and wish we would of ordered two each instead of only one :(. If I ever go back to Montreal I'll definitely stop back by.  They also have a cherry Coke type drink that tied the flavors together quite nicely. Good work over there!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat at, the food was delicious, the guys there were friendly, I've been going there a lot lately ,"}
{"text":"Awesome smoked brisket deli.  They let you order the meats by lean, medium, and fat cuts.  'Nuff said."}
{"text":"This review is not about schwartz's in Montreal. Its about something they are passing off as the real Mccoy.

So here goes.

Each time I'm in Montreal I have to visit Schwartz's for a smoked meat sandwich.  There is no deli anywhere that can come close to the goodness of their smoked meat.  I alway take home a few pounds of smoked meat shrink wrapped.  It stays good until I arrive home in Toronto.  Today I was at Costco and was extremely happy to find costco selling Schwartz's in pouches in a 1 kg box.   Of course I purchased one and could not wait to try it.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  I don't know who is supplying this product and passing it off as the original.  It was OK but definitely was not the original Schwartz's in Montreal.   This is the first and last time I will buy this poor knockoff. 

VERY DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"An iconic Montreal establishment. Definitely visit if you are there. Now....is it better than Katz' and Carnegie....not to me. But I fully enjoyed their smaller sandwiches, I had 2 and I love iconic establishments which this is as much as Katz'.

The smoked flavor was not as pronounced as I expected, buy very nice. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from New York and have been to Katz and other supposedly \"best\" delis in the world. Therefore we can safely say that Schwartz is better than all those places in New York by far, and it is perhaps the best in eastern seaboard. No kidding, go check it out you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The food is definitely worth te wait if you're into smoked meet. I go there regularly for the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Meat lovers, check this place out!  We went here on the recommendation of some folks we chatted with in our hotel.  They warned us that the line would be around the block, but that it moved quickly.  In an attempt to avoid this, we went at 10:30 am and we were able to sit right away.  Upon sitting down, we were asked, \"First time here?\"  Yes...  \"Number 3.\"  Ok...  Within a minute our sandwiches arrived.  There was a heap of deliciously smoked and spiced meat and a little bit of mustard on what appeared to be teeny tiny slices of bread, but that was more because of the comparison to the incredible amount of meat.  It was delicious!  I am very glad I found this place during my trip."}
{"text":"If you've never been to Schwartz's. You've never been to Montreal.

On the way home from a long drive from Tremblant back to Toronto, my bf and I decided to take a detour into Schwartz's if we were passing by Montreal.

If you're craving this montreal classic, make sure you allow enough time to line up. The service is quick, but the wait in line is usually brutal. Going in on a extreme cold weather alert night, a warm toasty smoked meat sandwich sure hit the spot!

My favourite is their pickle. Crunchy, juicy, pickles.  :)"}
{"text":"If my husband were writing this review, he'd give Schwartz's five stars. We live in Atlanta, and finding a decent Jewish deli with a really good smoked meat sandwich is all but an impossibility. Sure, some restaurants try to imitate what Schwartz's serves up so easily, but to get the real deal, make this place a stop on your next trip to Montreal. 

But be warned. Schwartz's is not for the claustrophobic. They'll cram you in so close to complete strangers that you can smell their deodorant. (Or lack thereof.) The line is often long, but moves quickly, so even if you want to linger over your meal, the brusque staff will not allow it. Better to get that sandwich - along with a glorious garlicky pickle and a side of their delicious cole slaw - to go, and head to one of Montreal's beautiful parks where you can sit and enjoy your bounty in peace."}
{"text":"Not sure I can improve on the combined wisdom of 771 previous reviewers, so here's the upshot:

.:. Horrendously long lines. Order from the to-go counter instead, where there's no line and almost always a couple of chairs in the back. Or eat standing up. It's not worth the hassle of waiting for a table.
.:. \"Smoked Meat\" is really just brisket. It's a little on the salty side, but has excellent flavor. I recommend a medium fat level: the lean ends can be dry but the fatty ends are practically inedible.
.:. Rye bread and spicy mustard: YES. Classic Jewish deli food! Just don't tell the Canadians they didn't invent it. :)
.:. Fries: average. A little on the dry side. I'd skip them in the future.
.:. Price: a little high for the quality, but not bad. Worth doing once, if only so people will stop telling you it's a necessary element of your Montreal experience."}
{"text":"A classic! Order the medium smoked meat (don't call it pastrami) with mustard, a pickle, and a cherry Cott. Oh, and the fries and poutine are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to the hype! It's a modest space that gives off an old-fashioned deli vibe. During the day, you can pop in next door if you're only dropping by to purchase packaged meat to take home.

I really love the simple and laid-back concept of this place. Nothing fancy, just amazing smoked meat sandwiches that I'll always be back for during trips to Montreal. The bread paired with the smoked meat is perfect in my opinion, just enough to hold the sandwich together! It doesn't take away from the quality of meat which is what you're here for.

If you're in town this is not a place to miss - pop in for their famous smoked meat sandwiches, a cherry cola and pickle - you won't regret it!

P.S. Highly recommend buying their packaged meats, then you can enjoy these sandwiches in the comfort of your own home."}
{"text":"Schwartz's Smoked Meat of course on our \"To Eat\" list for Montreal. 

We were so anxious, but unfortunately arriving at 8:30 AM was kind of early.... too early... no lines... and of course no Meat...

11 AM Sunday arrived to a fully packed restaurant.. But luckily, I went and just hogged the last 3 seats at the counter...Now we talking business!

Maybe of the high expectations.. I was not impressed with my Smoked Meat Sandwich Medium Fat ($6.15)... it definitely not tender or moist as expected...blame it on the lean meat?

2nd order of Extra Fat was just a little better.. I am not convinced... this is decent but not good... and why am I eating a EXTRA FAT Smoked Meat Sandwich?! I thought I am on and on going diet!! And it was funny to see the reaction of the staffs when I placed my order!

I secretly have to admit that Katz's in NYC is much better, but Schwartz's pricing definitely more down to earth!

Should had skip the Salami Sandwich ($5.95) that was not worth your while!

12:00 PM Sunday, the huge line of over 30 people by the time we finished!! Seriously, I don't think it is worth the wait in the cold for Schwartz's.. but I would have not know until I tried.. and I am not going to line up for that!"}
{"text":"A famous deli with amazing smoked meat sandwiches. Pastrami and roast beef sandwiches are freakin awesome. It's a divey, whole in the wall type of place. But the food is so worth the visit. Gotta love a huge portion and quality meats!"}
{"text":"It's okay. My mom says this was a popular sandwich store for its smoked meat. We waited for a few minutes depending on the line. The sandwiches were staked with meat and some bread. Way too much meat for me to eat and mostly fat. Gotta go try this place ;) Only got 5 sandwiches when my mom ordered 6... hmmm"}
{"text":"We found the line to be be pretty short one night around 8pm. (At 3pm, it's nearly to the corner!). Definitely a tourist place, but the waiters seemed pretty friendly unless you were completely clueless and then you can become the entertainment for your table mates. Solid corned beef and a pretty good serving size as well. Definitely a fun atmosphere and worth checking out."}
{"text":"The classic. Every time: smoked meat (fatty), fries, pickle, cherry pop. 

Yes, the service is often short, but that's part of the charm. Yes, there is a line and you will be seated with other people. Yes, the Main Deli across the street is 90% as good without the line. Even so, I just keep coming back to Schwartz's every time. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very overrated, dry meat and only comes with a spit of mustard that barely helps swallowing a bite. Better off getting a meat sandwich from Reubens."}
{"text":"I have to say that in the beginning I didn't understand why this place is so popular with some buns and loads of meat in between. We got there in the Sunday evening. There're line for dine in and line for takeout. I ordered the classic sandwich and the meat is really flavorful and tender. The sandwich tastes really good. But I have to say it's a bit too much meat for me and it took me really long time to digest the food in the end."}
{"text":"So so so yummy! I want to stand up and clap hands for the famous long-history smoked beef sandwich!! The meat is tender and soft"}
{"text":"We hadn't been there in several years, no wait line during Winter. It was great again, I wish they would add soup during months.  The smoked meat sandwiches were still large portions, super pickles and delicious coleslaw."}
{"text":"Tout le monde va chez Schwartz mais j'ai mangé meilleurs ailleurs pour des prix inférieurs dans des enseignes tout aussi anciennes."}
{"text":"What a great find in the heart of Montreal. Stopped by on a recommendation from my dad and I am so glad we did. Read that the lines get long and they did not lie. When we walked up, the line was already at least 20 people deep. We noticed that there was a take out section so we went there. Pro tip: if you are here just to enjoy the sandwich and aren't big on the whole experience save yourself time and go to the take out, you can order a sandwich and fries with all the fixings and take your meal to the back where they have a few chairs and tables. Another tip, take see meat home. They slice them fresh and place them in sealed bags. Heating is easy and you get to enjoy sandwiches well after vacation and give yourself a little flashback to the good old times. Staff was very friendly and you can tell they have been doing this a while. I will say, if you decide to wait online, it seemed that the line doesove fairly quickly. When we exited, the crowd around us standing in line we're already inside, but I can't say how the line looks once youre inside. There is only Street parking and it's metered so be prepared to have to add quarters. Make sure you grab a pickle to go with your sandwich and if you get meat to go, buy the bread. It makes the sandwich that much better."}
{"text":"À rayer des guides touristiques
 
Schwartz's est une charcuterie hébraïque, l'un des restaurants de sandwichs à la viande fumée les mieux connus de Montréal. Une institution, vraiment ?! C'est pas parce que c'est recommandé par les guides touristiques et visité par les vedettes que c'est grandiose.
 
L'intérieur respire la médiocrité, la friture et le gras. L'ambiance est bruyante et peu chaleureuse. Le confort n'existe pas, grâce à des tables minuscules et des chaises bien rigides dans un espace étriqué. Un service minimum est offert par des serveurs indifférents, qui toutefois n'hésiteront pas à signaler : \"Pour info, le pourboire ici c'est 15 % minimum.\". Tout est fait pour nous inciter à manger vite et à libérer notre place aussitôt. Et ça tombe bien, c'est exactement ce qu'ils veulent, parce qu'il y a d'autres pigeons qui attendent derrière.
 
J'y ai fait 2 passages, commandant une première fois un smoked meat en sandwich et l'autre fois un smoked meat en assiette garnie. Et invariablement, j'ai trouvé cela grossier et sans intérêt. La viande déborde de gras et le pain est à la limite du rassis (et ce n'est pas la moutarde aspergée approximativement qui change quelque chose). J'ai goûté du smoked meat plus savoureux, notamment au pub Burgundy Lion, qui n'est même pas spécialisé là-dedans.
 
Mon conseil : Évitez de perdre votre temps dans l'interminable line-up et rendez-vous à une adresse qui vaut vraiment la peine.

{"text":"I'll keep my review short because its been covered forever and a day..

I have two words to describe this place...

Life Changing..."}
{"text":"I came here excited to try a smoked meat sandwich from the birthplace of the smoked meat sandwich. I got to the restaurant at around 5:30pm, thinking that it would be early enough to beat the dinner rush. Unfortunately, I was wrong. There was already a lineup out the door. I decided to get takeout instead because I didn't feel like waiting in line. I ordered the famous smoked meat sandwich and I was surprised at who small it was. Although I liked the hand carved meat, I found that it was a bit too lean for my liking. I was also surprised to see that there was no pickle included with the meal. I also wanted to order coleslaw, but the takeout menu didn't even include coleslaw, which was pretty disappointing. Overall, the small portion of passable smoked meat was not worth $9.50. I've been to many delis and would definitely not come back here."}
{"text":"I must admit I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy it, but the meat is sooo tender with wonderful flavor... what's not to like! The slaw was vinegary and delicious.., no mayo. The fries were fine. The real show stopper is the meat, which was prepared perfectly(we got the medium fat). My husband and I will return each and every time we return to Montreal. Keep in mind this place accepts cash only."}
{"text":"This was clearly our favorite meal in Montreal.  After walking uphill for what felt like 2 miles, we finally got to Schwartz.  There was no way I was leaving Montreal without having a smoked meat sandwich here.  My husband and I had just eaten a large lunch but that didn't stop us from having a smoked meat sandwich. 

We order a sandwich (not super fatty) and seriously inhaled it while repeating that we weren't hungry.  The manager came by to check on us and see how we were doing.  We struck up a conversation with him and he told us that Celine Dion just bought part of Schwartz.  (I guess those Vegas concerts aren't doing so well for her??)  He also told us about Bourdain's stopover there.  Since we were tourists, they also shared some great local places to eat during our stay in Montreal.  

Overall, the service was great and the smoked meat was to die for!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday at around 4 pm and got a seat pretty quickly, but then the people behind us had to wait for a bit.
Ordered a smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle, and pop.
The simplicity of the sandwich itself amazes me a bit. It's got a spread of mustard and the smoked meat just falls apart in your mouth in a good way! Though I was impressed, I wasn't absolutely smitten.
Fries were good and pickle was crunchy. But don't bother wasting your money on anything but the smoked meat, because it's what they do best.
They tend to require turnover because of their line ups so don't take their haste as being dismissive."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype. I first saw the Andrew Zimmern TV show about this place. I was intrigued, so I gave this place a go. WOW! What an amazing smoked meat sandwich! The meat melts in your mouth. To top it off, this place is fairly priced too! If I lived here this would be a weekly visit. I definitely recommend Schwartz's!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I had smoked meat, coleslaw and cherry drink. I am glad that I got coleslaw since it smoke meat taste so much better with coleslaw - think about pulled pork. This coleslaw didnt even have any mayo in there. So refreshing! Highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"pros: great history. great ambiance. they give you a gynormous pickle.

cons: long lines. they cram you in there like sardines - often times having to share a table with complete strangers. last few times i've been here the smoked meat sandwich was very dry. perhaps it's my own fault for asking for \"lean cut.\""}
{"text":"Yes. It's that damn good.

If you haven't tried it yet and live in Montreal, you live under a rock."}
{"text":"There was a massive line today and we expected to wait over an hour. It was really hot and we almost gave in and went across the street to main-I had been there before and it was very good, but I have always wanted to check out Schwartz's hype. We waited maybe 20-30 minutes, the wait seemed like it was going to be longer! Once we were in the shade, it was bearable! We were seated at the bar, tables of two get seated faster than larger tables because of layout. Our food came SUPER fast once we were there. The smoked meat was extremely tender. Best I've had. Not sure if it lived up to the hype, but it was definitely very good smoked meat.mmm"}
{"text":"Worth the wait!

This was our first stop in Montréal and the 4 of us were happy to wait, it wasn't too bad of a line.
We obviously all ordered the infamous smoked meat sandwich. Soft bread, extra fatty pastrami, and mustard makes for the perfect sandwich!
We also got pickles (each one is huge) and an order fries (they were kind of sweet).

It's more filling than you would think! 

Svhwartz's is definitely the Katz's of Montreal :)"}
{"text":"just go. And dont say lean"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is comparable to the Carnegie Deli in NYC, i.e. tourists, and only tourists, standing in line. But don't let that deter you, because the food is straight-up Katz's in NYC, i.e. fantastic, no-frills meat sandwiches in less-than-fantastic, no-frills surroundings. 

Whatever you do, for God's sake, don't stand in that line. Order from the to-go counter next door, buy a Schwartz's tote bag, and schlep the whole delicious mess across the street, where someone has created a communal terrasse out of a shipping container. 

Eat your meal while listening to the nearby accordion player run through his repertoire of unidentifiable but atmospheric songs, and give him a nice tip when you're done. Bliss."}
{"text":"Smoked meat !  As opposed to NYC Katz deli serving pastrami and corned beef.  Depending on the cut of course of which  mine was medium fat, I thought  it was slightly dry and needing a bit more seasoning.  The waiters were obnoxious 
And somewhat rude in a entertaining way. I'm glad I came   The family style atmosphere and ambience make for memorable bytes."}
{"text":"Pretty good deli place in Montreal. Ordered the take out to avoid the long line. The sandwiches are pretty good, but you may need some vegies afterwards."}
{"text":"You must be truly dumb to give this place less than 5 stars. Really if you think this place deserves anything less than a perfect 5 star rating you must live a truly miserable life, devoid of any true joy or pleasure. Like the dude below me who turned his 4 star review into a post about his own smoked meats. Don't listen to that guy. What a silly review from a sad man.

My girlfriend and I were in Montreal for 4 days. We ate here 3 times. The meat? Killer. The slaw? Choice. The cream soda? Righteous. The liver steak? Very good if you like liver steak, if you don't I wouldn't say you should try it but live your own life. You clearly already made good decisions by just walking in the door of this beautiful place so I trust your judgement.

Dont be a fool. If you're passing through Montreal or any part of Canada, it's worth it to come here."}
{"text":"We got a medium smoked meat sandwich and it was DELICIOUS! A friend had recommended that we stop by here during our time in Montreal. The meat was so tender and the bread was incredible. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of this sandwich!"}
{"text":"Okay so after having Katz's in NYC and discovering this magical world of pastrami sandwiches and smoked meat, you know I had to give this place a try. We went on a cold rainy night and not many people were there. Which I'm not going to complain about considering how long I had to wait at Katz's. We both got the sandwich and a black cherry coke and the order came up fairly quick. The sandwich was overflowing with meat, just the way it should be! I didn't have it with the cherry coke at Katz and boy do I regret so because somehow they just go together like pb&j. Although I don't think the sandwich is exactly matched up to that of Katz's yet--there's just something lacking that I can't exactly pinpoint, could be that the meat was a bit drier or they didn't pre put the mustard in it (tip: douse your sandwich in mustard trust me!!), I don't know--but it is no doubt the next best thing and definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"There is something to be said when a restaurant can be \"Wikipedia\"ed. Line-up outside of Schwartz's is massive regardless of the time of day. The Hebrew Delicatessen is worshiped by tourists and locals alike. Schwartz is a well-oiled machine. I am surprised Harvard Business Review has yet to study Schwartz's. The processes result in a sustainable advantage in the marketplace. 

VRIO Framework

Value: Neutralizes external threats with unique mandatory 10 day meat curing time and high inventory turnover. Smoked meat sandwiches are served by fat content: lean, medium and fat. The theory of YOLO (You Only Live Once) suggests fat. As well, the theory of YOLO also suggests a cheesy smoked meat poutine, the ingestion of your weekly fat intake in one sitting. 

Rarity: Patrons love Schwartz's like fat kids love pie. Limited supply and persistence over time are contributions to its recipe of success.  Expect a plate of succulent smoked meat. 

Imitability: Schwartz's brand is inimitable. The \"hole in the wall\" décor speaks to its 80 years of history.  This even allows Schwartz's to add merchandizes to its product mix. 

Organization: Complementary capabilities of staff, supplier and culture. The orders are cascaded in a transparent reporting structure. 

Don't forget to complete your meal with artificially flavoured black cherry soda!  Disturbing an 80 years-old carefully designed product mix tradition is bad karma!"}
{"text":"Super excellent smoked meat sandwiches. It's like a less awful version of Katz' in NY. The waitstaff is so incredibly nice and friendly. It's like we were chatting with old friends. They sit you down at a long table with strangers, and it's quite cramped, but we lucked out with cool table mates.

The sandwiches are a little small and a little basic, but honestly I'm tired of over-the-top foot-high 90%-pastrami Jewish sandwiches. The medium sandwich was the perfect portion size. It was some of the most tender smoked meat I've ever had; it's like everything that you wish that brisket could be. The pickles here are strong and pickle-y.

This place is cash only though! There's an ATM inside (with a reasonable charge) that only takes Canadian bank cards and a bank across the street."}
{"text":"We were hanging around Montreal and it was getting a little bit later and decided that we wanted to check out the Hype that was Schwartz's hot pastrami sandwiches.  

Well...it's not Katz...to me it was closer to a traditional thick cut corned beef rather than pastrami.  But for 8 or 9 bucks it wasn't a bad sandwich at all.  Sadly, it was tiny.  Like a small Wonderbread loaf stacked with meat.  Which means, it really wasn't that big.  So while it was delicious...it was in no way, shape, or form - enough.

So it's good, don't get me wrong...it's just small..."}
{"text":"Epic deliciousness. On my last trip to Montreal, I went here three times in a week. The smoked meat truly is the best with a side of fries & washed down with black cherry soda made especially for them."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich au smoked meat, très goûteux! Ambiance conviviale. Un must à Montréal."}
{"text":"The line may be long but it moves. The meat was spot on. Simple and delicious. As good as smoked meat gets. Friendly, classic, quick service."}
{"text":"It's very similar to Kats deli in New York City. The meat is so tender and juicy. This place is also so busy like kats. There was a line when we went. We waited about 10 min before we were seated. There is a deferent entrance for takeout. Also a line there but not as big as dining in. Good food good people."}
{"text":"When people mentioned about the greatness of Montreal's smoked meat, they are really referring to Schwartz's. The others might attempt to imitate but they failed miserably.The place might be small, dirty, crowded, and you have to wait in line most of the time, but it's all worth it.

Order your smoked meat lean, medium or fatty and they are equally delicious. I always ask the server to order enough meat for our group and they'll know what to do. Take a few pieces of meat and put them in between the rye breads. Add a little mustard and voila - the best dinner in Montreal. It goes well with cherry coke too.

Note that you might have to share tables because they don't have a lot of spaces. Apparently the owner refuses to move to a bigger place. If you are in Montreal, you must try Schwartz's!"}
{"text":"Meilleur smoke meat à Montréal. Une des rares place cosmopolitisme où toutes les classes sociales et tous les ethnies cohabitent ensemble. Schwartz est une représentation de ce que Montreal a de plus beau."}
{"text":"That was fun!  We waited in line on busy Saturday morning for about fifteen minutes. The wait is a little less for two people as you can sit at the bar. The server was very friendly and knew what to recommend to us. We got two smoked meat sandwiches, a plate of fries and a pickle.  Don't come here to eat anything else, the meat the tender and melt in your mouth. It's also not overly salty as I expected it to be. Just the perfect little meal for me."}
{"text":"Here's what you need to know about Schwartz's - the long line to get in is for the dine-in experience. There's also a takeout shop to the left where the lines are minimal, and the menu is the same. Wait 5 minutes there if you can go without the restaurant experience and the hour long line.

Their smoked meat sandwich was preeeeetty great. Smoked brisket piled high on rye bread with just the right amount of yellow mustard. Delicious.

Take it to go and sit on the bench across the street to watch the suckers still waiting on line."}
{"text":"A really good sandwich but they changed owners and the price has doubled. Seems like they are ruining a good thing. I like the lean sandwich, the regular doesnt do it for me with its large fatty pieces.  Get extra mustard as well.

Their fries aren't very good."}
{"text":"Schwartz's est un classique de Montréal, connu pour son fameux sandwhich smoke-meat. Il y a presque toujours une ligne d'attente à l'extérieur mais ça en vaut le coût autant pour la bouffe que l'ambiance d'une époque d'autre fois. Soyez prêts à en resortir le bedaine pleine!

Vous pouvez aussi y acheter plusieurs de leurs produits pour emporter si vous préférez y acheter votre viande et en profiter à partir du confort de votre maison.

C'est un endroit idéal pour le lunch ou un souper rapide entre amis. Rien de compliqué, service rapide et bouffe remplissante."}
{"text":"Huuuuuum cette viande fumée ! Et attention c'est une quasi végétarienne qui en parle, vraiment la viande c'est pas mon péché mignon. Accueil rapide mais adorable. Dommage juste qu'il n'y est pas un peu plus de pain par rapport à la quantité de viande servi dans les sandwichs. Allez y !"}
{"text":"For starters, make sure you're in the correct line, as there's one for dining-in and one for take out! We waited in line for about 30 minutes... Worth every minute!
The meat was fantastic; taste was awesome and great texture, it almost melts in your mouth. They give generous portions, a stack of smoked meat that falls out of the bread when eating it.  Although this place is known for their meat, their fries are also brag-worthy!  We got pickles and a side of french fries, which, when coupled with the sandwich was phenomenal!! I was not a fan of smoked meat prior to this expereince however this gem of a restaurant has me sold! ABSOLUMENT!"}
{"text":"Sublime! Smoked meat (brisket) is a reason to visit Montreal. Perfectly pink, melt-in-your-mouth tender, well seasoned, and trimmed in scrumptious fat... You must have this in your life... And I only tried 1/4 lb.

Undoubtedly 5 stars and assuredly a must do on every and all trips to Montreal. I was lukewarm to the idea of making a point to visit a Jewish deli in Quebec. How and why would a \"deli\" be a destination.  Even though I saw quotes from an American Francophile celebrity chef imploring tourists to visit Schwartz's I remained non-plussed.

Then I asked my tour guide a life long Montrealer an open question, \"What Québécois food must I be sure to eat?\" - expecting to be told to try pouting or venison, I was surprised when he said our smoked meats and that redoubled when he said Schwartz's is one of the best in the province.

That piqued my interest but I foolishly did not set an intent on this as a destination. Instead I chanced upon it while strolling on St. Laurent and decided to grab some takeout. I was able to order by the pound and being very full at the time only ordered a quarter pound for me and Erin to share."}
{"text":"Big fans of Katz's Deli in NYC, we trekked over to Schwartz's to try smoked meat on rye and were not disappointed.  Didn't wanna wait on line for a table so we ambled into the takeout area next door, ordered a sandwich with mustard to share, grabbed some sour pickles and a coke, and were lucky enough to catch two stools at the rear seating area.  At first when I was handed the sandwich in a paper bag, I thought there wasn't going to be much to it because it seemed so small.  But when I opened the bag and saw how stacked it was with meat I understood.  Whether you call it pastrami or smoked meat, it was excellent.  Like Katz's, the meat is cut a little thicker than your typical deli, and it's not so lean so there's a bit of fat, but that just adds flavor and helps the meat really melt in your mouth.  So glad we tried it.  Wrote a comment on a napkin and added it to a wall of napkins along the back.  Just a great experience."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place on Yelp during my weekend in Montreal. I do love me some Jewish deli... so when I found it, I was excited. I've never had \"smoked\" meat, so to me, it was like a kid eating a mystery meat sandwich. Because of all the warnings of \"long lines\" and what not.... with the quickness, I hopped on the subway and bus with my bf from our hotel, 20 mins away. Turns out there was the street fair madness on Laurent, so our bus took a detour, and we got off a couple stops too late (damn you google maps!). Anyways, after getting off the bus stop, I literally ran like the wind to try to beat the so-called crowd. Many blocks later I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.... it was SCHWARTZ'S... bright orange. I ran some more (with my trailing bf). I ran to.... no line. 

Haha.... well, that was before I knew there was two Schwartz's next to each other. So I suppose the sit down place might have a wait, but there was also a tent of outdoor seating, which looked pretty full but no one was in line waiting. So we went inside to order 1 lb of smoked meat, cole slaw, and a turkey sandwich. There was actually plenty of seating in the back.

The anticipation... opened up the package to a mound of smoked meat. Poor cows. Toppled tons of pepper and mustard on it and voila... yummy. Meat overkill for sure, but couldn't waste the pound, each of us consuming half a pound of hefty meat. Thank god for no bread, or we wouldn't have been able to finish it! Mixed the coleslaw (vinegary) with the meat and made mini sandwiches sans bread. Saved the turkey sandwich for watching Phelps swim at the Olympic stadium.

Overall great meat. You can't get that stuff in NYC, so it did me good. Thank you Schwartz!"}
{"text":"been here quite a few times its just great smoked meat!! love it!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what I was missing my whole life until I ate at Schwart's. It's the kind of place that makes you want to move all the way to Montreal just so you can be near it.

We were recommended this place as the \"go-to\" for Montreal smoked meat samiches. I've never been partial to Montreal smoked beef but after eating here I believe it's because no one does it right.

The place itself is a very narrow shop, very retro in an almost dingy way. The ceiling looks like it might sink in and collapse at any minute and you wonder if it's really all that safe to come in. We managed to snag a seat later in the night but boy was it packed and filled with people to the brim.

When the sandwiches come out, it's so simple you kinda have to do a double take to assure yourself that's it. Two plain looking pieces of bread smothered with yellow mustard spread apart by a heaping mountain of meat. At this point I'm like \"why even give me bread?\" I pull out a piece of beef and munch and OH MY GOD I SWEAR I HEARD THE ANGELS SING. The tenderness mixed with the smokiness mixed with all that hallelujah seasoning. You want to bathe in it. I hate it when smoking places stinge me in on the smoky flavour but this place delivers it.

The process is even more fantastic, and would explain the flavour. (Don't shoot me if I don't remember it to a tee.) The beef, I am told, is marinated for 13 days to age and let the flavors set, smoked for 10 hours (or something?), and steamed for 10 hours leading to the ungodly amount of tenderness, suppleness, and flavor.

This is just one of those places that you have to eat at when you're in the city, for like every day, and every meal."}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich is their signature, so if you ever visit Montreal, you should get it from here.  There will be other places that sell them, but I heard this is the best.  The sandwich may seem plain (bread, meat & mustard), but I actually think this is the best way to taste and enjoy the smoked meat.  Delish!  We ordered their poutine as well.  It was pretty good, but I can't say I'm a poutine expert.  

As expected, the place was packed, and there was a line when we got there, which was around 3:00pm on a saturday.  Also, don't be weirded out if you or your party get split up or have to sit next to strangers.  They're just trying to accommodate everyone.  

I commend the workers there bc they are efficient with their service and were able to accommodate my friends and I (6 adults and a baby in a stroller).  It was a little tricky in that small place, but unlike other montreal establishments who turned us down bc of the stroller/space issue, they made sure we were ok.  It was a plus that he also volunteered to take a group pic of us knowing we're tourists. Haha!"}
{"text":"Ah, Schwartz's smoked meat. There seems to always be a line outside to eat in, and also a line for take-out. We got 1lb of smoked meat to go for $16.95 (cold) and ate it the next day as a picnic lunch. Good stuff.

Taste:  4/5
Service: 3/5
Atmosphere: 2/5
Value for Money: 4/5
Would I come again: Yes"}

Service: very informative, nice & helpful

Their signature sandwich, Smoked Meat, is delicious. I love how you can choose the level of lean meat in your sandwich. This is a great option for different tastes buds that like the fatty flavor & those that want to eat a little healthier with a leaner cut. Awesome option! There's actually 3 levels from lean, to some fattiness & extra fatty. You can't go wrong with the Smoked Meat Sandwich. Deelish!"}
{"text":"A MUST try in Montreal....yes, line up and get the smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle and coleslaw. It is worth the time and the hype because locals, tourists, everyone comes here. And bring cash...it's old school here.

I was just in NYC eating a pastrami sandwich at Katz's and everyone seems to compare NY vs Montreal for deli sandwiches. Well, here's the deal - they are both great in their own ways! Only downside of Katz's is the pastrami sandwich for about the same size is $18.45 USD while the smoked meat sandwich here is $7.95 CAD.

For those who might have been disappointed with their sandwich here - key is to get some fat with your smoked meat. They will ask you if you want it lean, medium or fatty.....you only live once so get the fatty cut (I did and it was love at first bite...it literally melted in my mouth) or at a minimum the medium cut. Meat was moist and not overly seasoned - just perfect....only thing is I am used to Winnipeg rye bread (which I think is the best) so the rye here was so-so in my opinion but I won't let that affect my rating for this place.

Fries are crispy, coleslaw is perfectly tangy and provides a lightness to the meal if that's even possible. 

We waited about 40 mins in line on the Victoria Monday starting at around 1 pm. There is a take out only store beside the original restaurant but that line wasn't any better. At least we got to sit down and eat although a bit cramped. Service has it's personality and charm and food is ready relatively fast. Bathroom is small but surprisingly clean despite the age of the place and the volume of people coming through.

Can't wait till my next visit!!!

note: this place is no longer owned by the Schwartz family....did you know Celine Dion's husband is one of the 4 owners of this place? bizarre trivia."}
{"text":"If you are patient, this place is worth the wait! Service was very nice and food was great!"}
{"text":"3 ingredients (smoked meat, mustard, and bread) combined to create something so delicious. Mmmm, I just wanted to inhale the whole sandwich. There was so much meat I had trouble finding the other piece of bread. 

Each bite was heavenly. Nice amount of marble to add that extra bit of surprise and burst of flavor. *happy sigh"}
{"text":"How can you not love Schwartz's? It's worth standing in the cold every year to get our lunch. Sandwich, lean, fries, cherry soda, pickle. It's not an institution for nothing!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a five because it is what it is supposed to be. Montreal's legendary smoked meat Mecca. Maybe that is the wrong metaphor since it's run by some Jewish folks, but the idea is right. 

It's crowded all the time and you have to wait in line outside for the surly wait person to come out and check the line for a party of your size. It looks like they have spent $0 ever for renovation. There is a window in front with a pile of whatever they've recently cooked. Usuallly, a pile of beef briskets, tied in string. Last night it was a
Pile of smoked chickens very unglamourously dumped. Of course, they don't stay here long, so why make an elegant pile? When you do get inside, you have very few choices to make on the limited menu. It is crowded and noisy and you need to be ready to order as you sit down. 

This is all, OK! It's part of the Schwartz's shtick. 

The simple thing to do, then, is immediately order a brisket sandwich and a pickle. I'd also get some fries (frites) which are pretty good. Here is the big hint - get the FATTY brisket in your sandwich. They have three settings: lean (=meat cardboard anywhere including here), medium (what I had mistakenly ordered in the past = just OK), and fatty (= the one that is unmatched and unbeatable). So moist and tender and flavorful. Fatty. Remember that. 

No beer here. Just water, soft drinks and such. In a way, it's brilliant because with the simple menu and inventory, they can serve you within five minutes even with all he crowd all the time. My chum from work (we are here for a convention) thought it was totally great too."}
{"text":"This is based on MY point of view and personal taste.

I had:
- Poutine (3 out of 10): french fries were old and the gravy is nothing special (very light on flavor). The curds added encorporated the mix, making more saciating.

- Sandwich Viande Fumée (4 out of 10): choice was lean meat.
The meat was ordinary, but a good amount.
The bread used is a sliced bread, which adds no flavor to the sandwich, other type would be a better choice, that way you taste more than meat (is still called a sandwich for a reason, otherwise would be meat only).
Is added mustard to do something... It does nothing.

I searched \"must do/eat in Montréal\" and this food was listed. It might be good for hangover food (?), but I honestly think there are better food for that, this is only overreated.
My tip: Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"pastrami sandwich was wonderfully fatty and rich."}
{"text":"Favorite spot in Montreal. Cash only so be prepared. There is usually a line out the door but if you grab a sandwich at their takeout window next door it's a lot faster."}
{"text":"Classic deli. Melt in your mouth smoked meat. As good as Katzs Deli in New York. The atmosphere is great, servers are as expected; a bit rude and abrupt and intimidating. Pickles are good, we ordered 8 smoked meat sandwiches... I had a fatty one followed by sharing a medium. The fatty was better, but my brother who ate a medium said his first medium was better than the second that we shared because it was fattier. Anyhow, I love connective tissue and a bit more fat, but it wasn't too much. 

Cheap prices for what you get especially considering a similar sandwich in New York is $18 and here its less than $10. 

I would go again and again. But alas I live 3500km away."}
{"text":"It's a great walking nabe, so don't be afraid to come here early (before 11), beat the crowd, and eat well. Personally, I like to start at Avenue du Mont-Royal and walk down towards Sherbrooke, 

The reason this is a 5-star (or 8-star or 11-star place) is because they do it right. There is never a bad bite in a Schartz's smoked meat sandwich, and that should be enough to garner four stars right there.

And, it is a sandwich - you can actually eat it with your hands. There's some more stars. This isn't the Carnegie Deli, selling you something eight inches high that you can't bite into, this is a real sandwich. Enjoy.

Plus, they treat you right, with a simple deli professionalism that gets you fed quickly and gives you time to enjoy. The sides are perfect deli style, nothing's been re-imagined and fusioned and brought into the 21st century, this is the real thing, traditional, and perfect.

Why bother if its \"just\" a perfect smoked meat sandwich? Well, if you like your brisket and you like your pastrami and you like your corned beef, you probably want this while you're in town, and there is none better. There are, I am told, places that are \"about\" as good - this one is definitely great. So beat the crowd, and go!"}
{"text":"Wow, are you kidding me? This was terrible! The sandwich was mini, but I guess for $7-8 it's an ok size. But the meat was flavorless and the texture was stringy for some parts. We went late night, so we didn't even have to wait for our food. If we actually waited, I would probably have hated it even more. The guy behind the counter was really rude also and kept trying to kick us out because the seating area was closed. You can just tell us, no need to shoo us away like fucking animals. Asshole. Keep your bland SMOKED MEAT. And I would never call it pastrami because it doesn't even come close!!!"}
{"text":"Better Than Katz . Hands Down.  If you can even compare smoked meat and pastrami but everyone does.  

No Contest.  Just dont ask for mayo. Kosher Deli. Mayo and red meat? 
 pshh cmon bro."}
{"text":"I had a salad. No, I'm kidding. I had the smoked meat sandwich and it was awesome.

The place isn't big on the finishes. It's all about the food here and the service isn't fantastic. It doesn't have to be because the smoked meat is the bomb. My waiter understood my English (\"smoked meat sandwich, please\") and it didn't take long before a half pound of tasty beef on sliced rye was placed in front of me. I ate half with fork before I dared to pick up the monster. When I was done, the plate was clean. I nearly picked it up and licked it.

Not cheap but it's not expensive. Very high quality comes at a decent price. It's worth it."}
{"text":"La meilleure pizza dans la petite Italie c'est chez Bottega Pizzeria, vraiment c'est la place par excellence! Merci"}
{"text":"The most unbelievable smoked meat sandwich you'll ever eat in your life. Wow this place is amazing, you may have to wait in line (in the rain when I was there), man-o-man it's still worth every minute of the wait.

Of course you should order the smoked meat sandwich (with white bread and yellow mustard), doesn't sound like much of a sandwich but it is amazing.

Don't miss this place when you're in Montreal.

Not interesting or important to me but... I understand Celine Dion has bought this gold mine. The food is good anyway."}
{"text":"Arrived around 500-530pm and just beat the crowd. Our party of 7 was first in line.  The place is a bit snug but you'll soon forget once you're served their smoked meat. Rib eye was pretty tasty and im a fan of mustard so loved the concoction with bread.  I didn't get to try their drink but heard nothing but good comments on it."}
{"text":"Reviewing for the take-out department next door to the restaurant.

Wait time - Looked like it'd be an hour if not more. I was on a schedule so I decided to get take out which incidentally was next door.

Service - SO AWFUL. I went into the main restaurant to kindly ask for take out and was told flippantly to take myself next door....Got there and was hustled quickly to order and asked for a tip straight out by the cashier....

Ambience - Small and deli-like. There are a few stools in the back next to the bathroom if you want to stay and eat.

Food - I ordered (2) sandwiches, smoked meat & salami and pickles! Everything was just OK. The sandwich seemed small for $9 and it was already pre-packed. There were parts of the meat that was juicy but not mind blowing.

Value - 2 sandwiches, pickles and a pop cost $22. Walked away feeling like I could've gotten a better deal somewhere else.

I don't recommend this place due, seems like it is just hyped up."}
{"text":"No words can describe the smoked meats that are produced at Schwartz...I look forward to every visit whilst in Montreal!
My wife and I always buy extra meat for the trip home, and usually have orders for our friend back in Mass.
Seating is fun and the restaurant is always busy."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The sandwhich pairs great with cherry coke! Great food and service!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Montreal I make sure I get at least one lunch at Schwartz.  The smoked meat sandwich, sour pickle and fries is the standard.  The service is fast and the food is great.

This is the authentic Jewish deli experience.  Treat yourself to a real Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich and a real Jewish deli, this is it."}
{"text":"upon entering schwartz's, just as the doors open for business, there isn't a shadow of a doubt that you have truly come upon something very special. if you need further evidence that lining up early is a good idea and will be well worth it, take a look at the long queue forming behind. 
shortly after sitting down at one of the communal tables, ordering and receiving your fare, you'll observe that the french fries are hot and fresh cut. the pickles are sour and delicious. if they have a half sour or two, make sure to indulge. and obviously, above all, the sandwiches are fantastic. rye bread and hand cut smoked meat, specifically as lean or fatty as you like it, drizzled with a bit of hot mustard, is unique and delicious. so many people love these sandwiches that there's no need to go in depth on why they are so good. they just are. a simple, honest, thoughtfully put together, properly and time-well-spent smoked meaty tangy sandwich. i can almost taste it now.
i will return to schwartz's each time i am lucky enough to find myself in montreal, and i hope you give them a try. (if there's a line, it is worth the wait.)"}
{"text":"so good!  and way cheaper than NYC!  get your sandwich to go to avoid the wait.  don't bother ordering lean.  and don't share (it won't be enough)."}
{"text":"A must visit for many tourist. When ordering smoke meat make sure you ask for cuts with fat - the more fat, the more flavours. I find cuts without fat are too dry.

Nevertheless, Schwartz's is an iconic Montreal restaurant, but I personally think Lester's has way better smoke meat, and you don't need to wait in line in -30 weather during winter."}
{"text":"The line outside the door was looong...but gladly the turnover was rather quick, so it didn't take us too long to be seated...but they do require everyone to be present to sit you! so make sure your whole party is there instead of wandering around checking out the area....

it took sometimes to get used to and warm up to the sarcasm of the server, they are rather friendly once you get used to it! LOL...

the smoked meat was really tasty! Order the medium one! We tried the medium and the lean.....fat content does make a different! LOL...but i am not sure if it worth the wait...

The black cherry coke went really well with the meat!"}
{"text":"worth the wait great sandwich made to order very quickly. get the pickle, try the fries

why can't they open up in Fort Lauderdale fl"}
{"text":"It's real amazing how a business can run for 80 years!! Food quality is awesome! Love the old and vintage decoration inside, cafeteria style seating. The classic Montreal Smoke meat sandwich is to died for, very good price for such big portion!! LOVE IT!!! It's a MUST go in Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"When visiting Montreal, one must have a Smoked Meat Sandwich. The place to get one is Schwartz's. My friends and I visited the small deli for an early dinner a few weeks ago. The deli was completely full but we only waited about 15 minutes for a seat. This is a sandwich one dreams about. The meat was perfectly tender, smokey and flavorful. Be aware the deli is cash only. I plan to be back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Visit for the experience. The servers will tell you not to bother ordering anything but the smoked meat. The servings are somewhat enormous. Terrific people-watching, entertaining wait staff, definite Montreal experience."}
{"text":"THE LINE WAS INSANE. We opted out and decided to order take out and we sat at some bar stools by there. We were in and out in 10 minutes. The smoked meat sandwich was delicious!! Everything was so soft. And the bread soaked up the juices. I will come here every time im in canada"}
{"text":"Meilleur smoke meet a Montréal. Une institution incontournable. Endroit exigue avec serveurs mocheton mais rapide. Attention, toujours une file d'attente interminable. Parfois plus rapide et simple de commander pour manger à l'extérieur."}
{"text":"Schwartz's was my first stop upon arriving in Montreal and really set the stage for a great trip! Ordered a smoked meat sandwich, medium fat, with a side of fries, dill pickle and a cherry coke.
I'll just start by saying that they make the best smoked meat I've ever had. Amazing flavour, melt in your moth tenderness, and man they sure don't skimp on the meat!
The pickles are large and taste homemade, and the sourness really compliments the meat.
The fries are fresh cut and fried to crispy golden perfection.
No wonder cherry coke is the beverage of choice, it goes so well with the whole meal.
I definitely recommend Schwartz's, it's worth the wait even when there's a huge line."}
{"text":"Been here many many times in my lifetime and as we all no there has been no change to this place. Food is consistently good. I always order extra lean and its very good and dry. What amazes me about this place is how the health inspectors don't shut it down!!! The place is so dirty. Maybe cause they never have any down time in the place to actually clean!!! Winter time is really bad but all you have to look at is their carpet that comes in from the back of the restaurant. They are disgustingly dirty or filthy better said!! But I guess this is a tourist trap and inspectors turn a blind eye to it esp. that Celine Dion owns it now!!! 
Dirt or no dirt I keep going back......"}
{"text":"Limited seating but the wait for our group of 10 took less than 10 minutes. Just be willing to share a table with strangers and or break into smaller groups if you come with more than 3or 4.
Service was fantastic and far better than I expected. Try the smoked meat sandwich and take the mustards. And follow the waiters advice and go with the pickle, fries and a black cherry cola.
Fantastic and kid friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Deli counter, it's basically what Katz is to New York. And I love Katz. I fucking love it, I get when I'm wasted at like 4 am sometimes and house the whole sandwich. But I might like smoked meat at Schwartz even more.

The meat was very juicy, we had it medium, you can get it fattier or leaner if you'd like. Loaded sandwich on rye with mustard. Meat is rosy and red, less of a bark than pastrami but perfectly smoky, rich and fatty in the right places. Also had a half-sour pickle.  One more thing: it's a lot cheaper than Katz but I guess everything is cheaper when ya leave New York. Go hear if you're a Beef nerd from New York or really, anywhere. Just eat this shit already."}
{"text":"Overhyped.

My sister highly recommended it, but my expectations were not met. 

The smoked meat sandwich was good, but not fabulous.

My friend and I ordered take out (I wonder if that's where the difference lies). If you waited 1.5hrs in line, and you were super hungry, anything would taste that much better. We only waited 5 minutes for take out.

There's a side door that suggests you can just pop by and order some food to go.

If you're a tourist, you might want to come to this place just to see what all the hype is about and personally decide whether it's actually good or just a hype. If that is so, I suggest take out, you'll waste a lot less time."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich is flavorful and tender. Accompanied with Cotts black cherry cola and it's a match made in heaven. It was a good lunch."}
{"text":"Went to Schwartz's on a Tuesday around 3:30, so no real line to speak of. Ordered the smoked meat sandwich fatty, with mustard, a pickle, coleslaw and cherry soda. I am from NYC and have had my fair share of corned beef and pastrami sandwiches. The brisket here is milder tasting than NYC pastrami, but it was tender and the hint of smoke with the fat from the point was simply delectable. However, the ends of the rye bread refused to yeild when bitten into, and destroyed the structure of the sandwich. I ended up with meat falling all over the plate ,and having to piece the sandwich back together. Everyone at my table had the same problem. Really killed the experience for me. 
I say try it if you've never been, but it was nothing to write home about for me."}
{"text":"So we all know Schwartz's is an institution. The ever present line-up demonstrates its iconic status not just as a quebec cultural landmark but as a Canadian one as well. Whether you like it or not Schwartz's is a must try. 

It was a cold, wet, damp day and I stood in line for 20-30 minutes and I hate line-ups but I was in Montreal and I had too pay homage. We eventually got in and were seated at the counter. The place is old and rickety and resembles a tomb, more than a shrine. But that is part of the charm and legend of Schwartz. Service is non-existent, you feel more like an interloper than a guest. Its like going to your new in-laws who wanted you too be a rich, jewish doctor, not a brown guy who writes Yelp reviews as a hobby. But too be fair the gentleman behind the counter was smiley and considerate. My wife and I ordered 2 medium smoked meats, a poutine and 2 cherry cokes, the classic. The poutine was terrible, the fries were far from crisp and had an al dente texture, which may be good for pasta but not so much for deep fried potatoes. I found the smoked meat too dry for my tastes but you don't get too stay in business for 80 years unless a lot of others do. But the cherry cola, that was the bomb!

As an aside if i do go back, ill ask for the fatty, not the medium next time. It might change the dryness of the meat. The plate looked like better value than the sandwich. Also i'd use the side entrance, located to the left of the main entrance and get take-out. No lines, no fuss, the same smoked meat to go, without the purgatory.

Watch-out for the lady who owns the churasqueiria at the top of the block where the line usually starts. She does not like her entrance being blocked and will animatedly tell you so!"}
{"text":"Well worth the long wait if you're a meat lover!!!"}
{"text":"Two years ago I was in Montreal on business. When my local contact met me in the morning, he asked me whether I had ever had Montreal's famous 'smoked meat'. I told him that I saw it listed on the breakfast menu at the Hotel Ruby Foo where I was staying, but I asked him what it was. He didn't understand my question. So I asked whether 'smoked meat' was beef, pork, or what? He looked confused and admitted that he didn't know. Later a meeting finished early, so he said he was going to take me to Schwartz's for the best 'smoked meat' in the city. We parked and walked down the street to find a line out the door and down the sidewalk. It was lunchtime and this place was packed. Eventually we got inside and were hustled down a narrow aisle to a long communal dining table where we literally sat elbow-to-elbow with strangers. A brisk, no nonsense server took our order and rushed away. As I recall you could order your 'smoked meat' sandwich with varying degrees of fattiness. I think medium fat was recommended to me. Soon our meals were unceremoniously plunked down in front of us. A tall 'smoked meat' sandwich stacked high with meat and bright yellow mustard. Some decent French fries and a beverage in a can. One look at the meat told me it was pastrami. So the mystery meat turned out to be pastrami. It was very good pastrami but just pastrami after all. It was obviously a memorable meal because I'm writing about it years later, but something needs to be said about Schwartz's. This deli is probably over 100-years-old, but it didn't look to me like they have ever cleaned the place in all that time. The floors were filthy. There's something to be said for authenticity and historical places, but why don't the owners take enough pride in their shop to clean it? It doesn't seem like they want to provide a clean and comfortable place for their dining guests to enjoy their food. Instead they run a cramped, crowded, dirty place with people standing outside in all weather waiting to get in the door. They're obviously riding on their well-deserved reputation for food but their hospitality leaves a lot to be desired. Oh well, I can say I ate at the famous Schwartz's..."}
{"text":"This is the famous Montreal smoked meat place. I have lived in Montreal my entire life, but I have never made it out to Schwartz's until recently. Because of this, I was well familiar with smoked meat before this experience.

Schwartz's is a very basic restaurant in terms of atmosphere. Nothing but a bar and a bunch of tables. While this might deter some people, I feel this is part of the charm.

One thing that caught me by surprise is that there doesn't seem to be any combos. I wanted a smoked meat sandwich, fries and a soft drink, so I had to buy each item separately. After tax and tip, this comes to about $20.

The smoked meat is quite good, although it is of the drier variety which is not my favourite. The fries were fine as well.

In the end, this is a very basic smoked meat experience. The food is good, but I think it is more expensive than this meal should be."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal and of course we had to try Schwartz's!
We went around 7pm, and there was a short line, but we were probably seated within 10 minutes. Our server was really friendly, and we ordered the smoked meat sandwich and a black cherry soda. Yum!

The sandwich was great. We went with their recommendation of \"medium\" fattiness, which seemed perfect. Moist, meat easily broke apart. Yum!

They are cash only, but there's also an ATM on the premises.
I know that it might seem touristy, but definitely give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. The sandwiches were not hefty and the flavor was not worth waiting for says my husband."}
{"text":"I'll probably be forcefully removed from Montreal for this but Schwart's is not mind-blowing. Don't get me wrong, the smoked meat is good and I would, and possibly will, get it again. But I certainly don't see why ppl are lining up around the block to get in."}
{"text":"I came during a rainy day and the place was still packed. Quite a testament to how much people love this place lol. I got the smoked meat sandwich (fatty because that's the best way :P)  and the poutine. The sandwich was small and could have been hotter but was definitely good. The poutine was just meh, kind of standard. I don't think this is one of the best sandwiches I've had but this is coming from someone who lives in NYC where there are landmarks for pastrami sandwiches like Katz. However, I will say this is a tasty little bite nonetheless."}
{"text":"Best place for Montreal smoked meat sandwiches. The sandwiches are packed with a heap load of meat with yellow mustard on white bread. With a side of fries and a pickle, its the go to place after hitting rippers in Montreal."}
{"text":"Good attempt at NYC style deli pastrami. Save the time and get take-out. PS Yellow mustard?? That's NOT NY style."}
{"text":"$9 Smoked meat sandwich! 
Reasonably priced, generously portioned, simply divine! 
Definitely lived up to the hype.

However, the fries that comes with it is a kind of soggy and not much to write home about IMHO. Still, does not take away the fact that this is a solid deli place in Montreal. 

PS: Most likely there is ALWAYS line. Come at late afternoon / very early dinner to avoid it. Or while u r waiting, come hang out by the ice cream place (Ripples)  across the deli place and get the ice cream there!"}
{"text":"Some day, I will go back to Montreal and the first thing I'd do is to go back to Schwartz's eat their smoked meat sandwich.  I really haven't eaten anything like it since. I was lost in the city for couple hours walking around in hot summer weather without being able to speak a word of french... Thats when I got here to grab some food.  We stood in line for 15 min or so, then got seated arm-to-arm with other groups of people all around me.  I was grouchy, sweaty and hungry.  Finally then, I took the first bite of my sandwich.  I can't forget, it was so good, my mood just changed 180 degree!!  I'd like to go back again!"}
{"text":"Il s'agit d'une enseigne existante depuis 1928. Un vrai et bon deli. Un service impeccable. Une viande très savoureuse. Nous l'avons choisie maigre ce qui rend le sandwich plus digeste. Les frites maisons sont appréciables, ainsi que la salade de choux pour la note diététique!"}

The service is horrific. I don't know many other places that come as close to being as bad as Schwart's. It's so bad that it's an inside joke between me and my friend Nick that ate there. For example, \"This food place is bad.\"Well, it's better than Schwartz's!\" Don't eat here, please, just don't. Eat at the ice cream place across the street. It's soooo much better. 

P.S. The 45 minute wait in line and waiter service sucks."}
{"text":"We walked in and were immediately greeted with hospitality. We sat at the bar and by recommendation from our server got the medium smoked meat sandwich which was amazing! We are glad we didn't go with the fatty (you have 3 choices- lean, medium or fatty) because it medium was perfect. Meal came out literally 2 minutes after ordering. 
Black cherry soda was very sweet but very tasty. Nash is like a slim Jim- worth trying, but not our favorite. 
The servers were funny, nice and made us feel right at home. One even made us each a paper napkin rose. Totally satisfied!"}

{"text":"oh man was this place oh oh so delicious.  I wanted another sandwhich after I finished mine.  

There will be a line out the door.  I recommend to go to the Takeout Section which is in the store next to it, and you won't have to wait in line. In the takeout section, they also have seating in the back via bar stools.   

We got the smoked meat sandwich $9.75 and it was so good! All the meat were fresh! The sandwiches are quite large so be prepared to share or be extremely hungry.  We would definitely have come back b/c it was just that delicious but there was too many places to eat at and too many things to see."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said.

Real smoked meat. 
Real experience.
Real yummy. 

End of story."}
{"text":"Had to wait about 35 mins to seat 5 but the smoked meat was fantastic. As was the service once we were seated. Don't forget the black cherry cola!"}
{"text":"Long wait in the snow but totally was worth it. Quick turnover. Now... I just gotta compare it with Katz..."}
{"text":"line up to long for smoke meat in front other side of the street I prefer  main deli the price is better and the food also"}
{"text":"Part of the culinary and cultural fabric of Montreal. In fact, I think Schwartz taught me the concept of culture. I've loved this place since I was a child - and would stop here every time I traveled between the US and the Maritime provinces while I was in university. I always get the same thing: (1) a fatty smoked meat sandwich (never lean!!!), (2) a pickle, and (3) a cherry coke. In my mind, it's the Jewish deli trifecta. The ying, and the yang, and the bang. My daughter always orders, and likes, their hot dogs too (which, as a smoke meat sandwich purist, disappoints me a little)."}
{"text":"Schwartz's was famous for its smoked meat and it lives up to the reputation. Be prepared for the long line and sharing a table with strangers. The best time to go is in the afternoon around 3 p.m. It's less crowded then. Our day plan involves a hearty breakfast and a late dinner reservation so we can enjoy Schwartz's sandwich in between. Just to think about it makes me hungry!"}
{"text":"Smoked meat sandwich was amazing.  I had smoked meat elsewhere and wasn't very good glad I gave second chance at Schwartz deli.  Service was excellent and fast!  Note the ATM didn't take debit card,  cash only.  We got there about 1130 on Tue and no line. We got the med fat and it was excellent!"}
{"text":"Do it the local way: A medium fat smoke meat with cherry coke and a pickle, as described in one of the greatest Canadian literature \"Barney's Version\" by Mordecai Richler. 
The local vibe and flavor really bring you back in time, especially late at night when there're less tourists. And you get to observe something like this: an old staff at the counter talked about life lessons and how to stay in a happy marriage to the younger staffs, an up-tight couple wearing fur coats and cocktail outfits showed up at the doorway and got turned down by the servers...
It's certainly a special place that you can't find elsewhere :)"}
{"text":"Best pastrami I ever had!!! I love the medium fat meat - it's even better than Langers and Kats in my opinion. It's really good - no wonder there's always a line outside. I highly recommend it if you are here!"}
{"text":"Over 90 years of history, this legendary place speaks for itself.  

If ordering the smoked meat sandwich, ask for medium fat, your palette/taste buds will thank you after.

Sandwich is small in size BUT it packs a bunch in terms of meat and taste.  Literally, I felt life is complete after finishing this.  

Then the next day, when the Swartz's craving hits but you have already left Montréal.  I can only reminiscent with words and pictures."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Schwartz's because of all the recommendations I got from friends and from what I read online. I made it a point to come here the first night I arrived. We got seated at the bar right away. 

The service was good. They were very talkative and engaged in conversation throughout the entire time we were there. I felt like it was a bit misleading though. We knew we each wanted a sandwich but he was also giving us other recommendations that everyone orders. He made it seem like a combo. We each ended up with our sandwich, a cherry cola, a pickle and two poutines to share between four people. 

Funny thing - neither of us actually like cherry cola or eat pickles but he kept saying it was \"not like what you get anywhere else\" and again, made it seem like a part of the combo so we agreed. I was a little upset because when our bill came, it was $100 for the four of us. A bit pricey in my opinion for food that didn't taste that great. 

There was nothing special about the poutine and we didn't finish it between the two of us. Can't say anything about the pickles since I don't actually eat pickles. The sandwich was dry so I had to keep adding mustard. At least it wasn't too salty!"}
{"text":"Very good Smoked meet sandwich.  I saved time by going to the take out counter instead of waiting in the long line.  The sandwich was smaller than I expected (which was good though).  Definitely a must try when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal a few days and this was on our must list because of travel shows, such as Bourdain.  Everyone had the smoked beef, or #3.  We also had fries and cole slaw.  The sandwich is ok.  The meat is a little drier than pastrami you get in the states.  The sandwiches are definitely smaller, but also much cheaper (around only $6).  The rye bread doesn't have seeds.  The mustard is standard deli, not spicy.  The fries were soggy, but I think that's the style here.  The cole slaw is more like pickled cabbage.  The cherry soda was good.  The line was super long, but fast.  It was full of tourists, just like us.  The service is very good and attentive.  One really good benefit is that they accept USD and will exchange into Canadian $ for free.  So, if you pay with a $100 bill, you will get straight Canadian change w/o a transaction fee.  So, you can think of it as a free money exchange!

I still think Langer's in Los Angeles is the best sandwich I've ever had.  It's pricey, but the meat is so juicy and thick cut."}
{"text":"Closer to 4.5 than 5 but in my opinion a bit overrated. It wasn't the Heaven on Earth it's made to be. Not to knock it really just feel it's not up to the hype that surrounds it. Meat wasn't as juicy as I would have expected. Half-sours were on point and I really like the cherry soda."}

{"text":"????????????????????????????20???????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I hate overcrowded, famous places like this where there is no place to sit half the time and then you end up having to share a table with 2 other people you don't know. Warning- I am not a communal dining person.

The two of us walked in around 1 pm. We heard great reviews about their smoked sandwich and decided to give it a try. We weren't super hungry, so we decided to share one sandwich, an order of fries and a cole slaw. 

When we walked in it was very tight and crowded for my liking. There was one couple ahead of us. We waited only a couple of minutes to be seated. We were seated with the couple ahead of us, all the way in the back of the restaurant. The couple we were seated with were foreigners and had no idea what sharing a table meant. The guy sat right next to his girl friend and me and my friend were just standing there trying to figure out how we should sit without making it awkward by sitting directly across from them. For all you non-Americans or non-Canadians, when you're at a restaurant like this, and you have to share a communal table, you have to SIT ACROSS FROM UR PARTNER NOT NEXT TO THEM. Thank God the waiter came over and corrected this for us. To be honest this kind of ruined my whole experience, i was really uncomfortable the rest of the time there. The guy really annoyed me. He had zero common sense, but whatever i digress. 

The sandwich was ok. Honestly, I've had better pastrami sandwiches in hole-in-the wall diners or delis in NYC. The fries were gross. The coleslaw was the only redeeming part of this whole lackluster experience.

Service was quick and friendly.  CASH ONLY!

Would I ever go here again if I'm ever in Montreal? Probably not.. unless it's for take out (more to avoid sitting with strangers) ...but again, as a New Yorker I can get good pastrami almost anywhere, why even bother?"}
{"text":"Another institution where the product doesn't live up to the hype.

If you see this spot as a touristic attraction, go for it. I've been here probably 4-5 times with different group of friends. However I cannot under how dirty this restaurant is. (I know that may add to the charm for some) From the floors to everything.

Smoked meat is a commodity by now in Montreal. Go find your own fav spot."}
{"text":"My goodness. Montreal is so lucky to have their very own Swartz Deli. I was walking by again the next day and had to force myself to keep on walking. It's the healthiest but it sure is almost to perfection."}
{"text":"We all need a slump buster every so often and something to break one out of a rut. For me, there are not many things that get me more excited than talking about meat. To end my dry spell, I could think of no place better to write about than Schwartz's.

On a recent trip to Montreal this spring, Schwartz's was the place that I made sure to stop by.  Founded in 1928, Schwartz's is a Montreal institution and is best known for their beloved smoked meat or viande fumee as the locals call it.  Whatever you call it, smoked meat is just plain delicious.  Unlike pastrami which has a distinct sweeter taste, smoked meat is brisket cured heavily with spices such as cracked peppercorns and coriander.  For me fat equals flavor, so I selected my smoked meat served medium which was the perfect combination of lean & fat cut from the middle of the brisket.  Served between 2 slices of rye bread slathered with mustard, this was the perfect late breakfast on a cold Montreal morning.  

If you plan to visit Schwartz's, keep in mind that this is a small place & does get very crowded with both locals and tourists alike. Unless you plan on taking a taxi here, Schwartz's is also about a 5-10 minute walk from the Sherbrooke Metro station.  Another interesting fact about Schwartz's is that they were recently purchased by a group that includes singer Celine Dion.  Being an old school eatery, I really do hope that they do not change anything as this is truly part of the Montreal experience and was one of the culinary highlights of my trip."}
{"text":"I'm not really going to waste too much time on this one as I'm sure that everything I say about Schwartz's has already been said. 
First off if you're a Montrealer and you are over the age of 4 and haven't been here yet then what is wrong with you? Schwartz's is a must try far all people visiting or living in Montreal and a place that you'll very quickly find yourself craving and missing more then you can imagine when you are out of the city for any length of time.
When it comes to your order its very simple, one regular smoke meat sandwich (none of this lean or medium crap, go big or go home) one dill pickle one order of fries one order of coleslaw and of course one Black Cherry Cott to wash it all down. I promise you'll never leave disappointed if you order that perfect combo"}
{"text":"Great! Got the poutine and a smoked meat sangwich. Delicious, and super fast service. Full disclosure, it's a small place and crowded, so I was a little weirded out by having to sit so close to strangers at a communal table. But I'm from Boston where the personal space bubbles are extra lahge and the surly side-eyes at strangers are rampant."}
{"text":"We were skeptical of this place for two reasons: 1 - the disgustingly long line and 2 - the fact that we aren't smoked meat fans. Looking back, both of these were irrelevant. The smoked meat sandwich (10$) was spectacular. Make sure you ask for \"medium fat\". Really, really good smoked meat, in all its peppery, salty, fatty glory. Would absolutely return. 

4.5/5
Pro tip - some miss the takeout line, that's much shorter than the restaurant line. Don't miss the takeout line."}
{"text":"I stopped in here around 11PM one night.  No wait.  I was one of 5 or 6 guys sitting at the counter.  I didn't really know what to expect, so I ordered something that looked good from the menu.  The guy behind the counter looked at me incredulously.  \"Really?  Look around.  Everyone here is having the smoked meat sandwich.  Trust me, that's what you want.\"  Okay, I gave in.  The sandwich was huge, stacked high with smoked meat.  Very tender and tasty.  I washed it down with a coke.  I didn't have the traditional black cherry soda + fries + pickle combo, which I discovered later is the classic meal.  In any case, it was a cool experience to eat at this historic diner.  I'm glad I checked it out."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????liver steak ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????ATM????????????????300??????ICBC???????????"}
{"text":"The liver plate was my favorite. The place is an authentic Montreal experience. I hated the waiting line though and not so many options."}
{"text":"Its a tourist thing ...
Faire la file et attendre ... à ta discretion .."}
{"text":"This place is literally down the block from the Air Bnb I'm staying at. At first I thought it was a long wait because there is a lot of people waiting outside. Luckily the line was for people who wanted to eat in. There is another entrance for people who wants to take out.

I got the smoked meat sandwich and it was very delicious. This place is known for it's smoked meat sandwiches. The sandwich is packed with meat and it melts in your mouth. If you are ever in Montreal, you should definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"They are famous for their sandwhich for a reason.   It's REALLY GOOD!  Probably the best Montreal smoked meat sandwhich that I've ever had in my life.    The poutine wasn't great but it was passable and not much more to upgrade to in your combo.  But the sandwhich made the line up and everything worth it!  Paired up with the cherry cola it made my day."}
{"text":"Marvelous Chocolate was amazed & surprised. Short of a long line :-) you've got wonder ahead. Come hungry."}
{"text":"Yes, the \"smoked meat\" is good here, and a huge portion, but maybe not the \"best\" pastrami I've ever had. 

What I don't get is the hype though... I suppose if you're just dying to eat in a tiny, cramped, historic, but grimy diner, elbow to elbow with people you don't know, this is your place.

Our not-so-friendly server looked and acted like a heroin addict, complete with unbuttoned shirt, greasy unwashed hair, and sweat pouring off him. A couple of the other servers looked similar, so I have to question if some of that lack of hygiene is getting into the food. One server told me the owners had paid $10 million for the place when they bought it from Celine Dion's husband... Guess they didn't have any money left over for cleaning or renovations

For me, it's really not worth waiting in line for this. Take-out is the way to go here... 2 star place + 1 extra star for the meat"}
{"text":"Get the food to go! Don't be discouraged by the long line outside. That's the line for dining in the restaurant. I figured that too late and made a couple attempts before figuring out there are two sides to this place. One for take out and one side for the restaurant. I even settled for the place across the street. Still good, but doesn't compare. Stick to Schwartz! 

The smoked meat sandwich is worth getting. Meat is on point and moist enough. The bread is really soft. 

Don't leave this place without the coleslaw! It's probably the best I've had so far. It completes the sandwich!"}
{"text":"\" The place \" pour manger le meilleur smoked meat au monde!! Je mets 4 étoiles car le service est moyen et les employés ne sont pas les plus courtois et il serait temps en 2018, qu'ils acceptent d'autres formes de paiement que du Ca$h!! Malgré ça j'y retourne régulièrement."}
{"text":"It's simple, when in London you must eat a Salt Beef Sandwich and In Montreal you must eat a Smoked Meat Sandwich.

Ask anyone in the city and they will all point you to Schwartz's deli. While they are known for their smoked meat, their slapstick comedy should be an honorable mention. During my stay I was ribbed by the staff a few times (all in good fun of course) and saw they do the same to other patrons. 
They were good at their job and I am sure that they get asked 1000 times a day on what to order especially since everything is in French. They suggested a medium smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle and a black cherry soda. 

I must say that I liked the smoked meat better than salt beef (sorry London). The best way to eat one of these is \"medium\" (with a bit of fat) and fresh cut. I did notice that towards the end of my meal the meat did dry out a bit; so I would hate to imagine what a 8hr old smoked mat sandwich would look and taste like.. eek...

Like any city icon it gets quite crowded with both locals and tourists so my advice would be to go during off peak hours. I arrived at 10pm an had no problem getting a seat at the counter. If you come at any other time be prepared to wait.. Remember that it is worth the wait! Don't waste your time getting a smoked meat sandwich from anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"Quite the scene, be prepared to wait for a table or for takeout.  The takeout line today around 1 pm was at least 30 minutes.  The odd thing was, the line wasn't slow due to the food prep -- it was the cashiers who were amazingly slow, resulting in a winding, snail crawl of a line.  My husband prefers Katz's on the Lower East Side in NY, while I preferred the slightly leaner meat at Schwartz's.  Am glad we waited in line for takeout, but not sure I'd do it again."}
{"text":"As good as the hype is. It's a simple sandwich with tons of meat. Service is super quick and people are very nice too. Get it with a cherry coke :)"}
{"text":"The best thing (sandwich) I've ever eaten! Next time I'll eat the whole Combo for myself :) Highly recommend. Ps: do not let the wait turned you down"}
{"text":"Oh.  My.  God.  Yes.

You want lean meat?  F*ck you.  Don't clog up the line.  

You want your meat nice and buttery with tender melting fat, that has been smoked and seasoned, sliced by hand, and delivered to you on a platter with a stack of rye bread?  Come.  Come fast.  Come often.

I was here twice in a three day trip to Montreal.  Get the large platter.  Get it half medium, half fatty.  Do it.  Live a little.  Get yourself a pickle and some cole slaw, the vinegar helps to cut the fat.  Get a black cherry soda, the bubbles and sugar help cut the fat and salt.  

Just watch your waiters.  Mine was rude and terrible.  I was told by a Canadian friend, that I just received an authentic montreal experience.  But my waiter got everything wrong.  He brought me lean meat, and I wanted to stab him with a fork.  Luckily, he came back promptly with fatty meat.  

But you can't fault a place with such an incredible product like Schwartz's Smoked Meat on the basis of bad service.  You can't even fault them for being in Canada.  You can be resentful we don't have them in NY.  But we have good things in NY too.  Just sadly no Schwartz's

N.B. Skip the cream soda... the house Canadian brand tastes like ass.  Really, it tastes more like bubble gum, but either way... it's just wrong."}
{"text":"This place is famous for its cured meat and as a result, bussssyyy!  The line out the street runs 20-30 heads deep so the wait is 30 minutes or more. But here's the tip, get take out and you're in a different/much shorter line. Then at the back of the take-out counter there's a back corner with counter space where you can sit and eat. The sandwich and poutine were both really good but I wouldn't say that memorable to me. Worth a visit to see what everyone is raving about."}
{"text":"Once you actually get a to sit down and eat...the food is amazing.  Don't screw yourself trying to order anything but the smoked beef.  It's what you go there for and it is done well.  The line to get in sucks but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Man I guess I was lucky enough to visit Schwartz's when there wasn't a line out the door! Then again is was January and about 4 degrees out. Don't get me wrong it was packed but I quickly found seats at the counter. Super friendly, quick and easy guys working there, although they let me order toooo much meat haha Like the large plate. I ate it ALL, even extra pickles and bread and fries. and I didn't even feel bad about it.

Good God Damn that meat is soo good!"}
{"text":"It's a solid pastrami sandwich on rye.  If I go back I would just get the meat plate and feast on fatty meats.  Get there early and maybe don't come with a large group.  We only had two and were able to jump almost the entire queue to sit at the counter."}
{"text":"Soooo good ! Wish I lived in Montreal so I could have it all the time. There's always a line up (luckily I missed it) & it's always packed so you'll share a table with others but so worth it. Get the pickle & cherry drink, it's a classic !"}
{"text":"great NY deli. Get the smoked meat ....yummm"}
{"text":"mannn did we get lucky with the line when we headed out here! opened the doors & was seated right away... given it was even a packed night in the restaurant! i am still in disbelief that this simple sandwich is full of mouthwatering flavor. literally just smoked meat, a little mustard, & wheat bread. how... like, how?! is it so so so good!??!! there's hardly anything in it! in a world that i live in here back in the states we often eat food that is overly jammed packed with different ingredients i guess we forget how simplicity is also very delicious. you can choose 3 levels of fat content you want in your meat... the two is just right ... with the perfect balance of fat & meat. very very juicy. our server was so polite & helpful. service is REALLY quick. this place can easily be categorized as \"hyped\" based on the amount of yelp reviews ... but y'all take that back right now because it is not hyped at all. come see for yourselves.... it's the best!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Schwartz's after it was recommended to me by multiple people. When we first got there, there was a line out the door; that's always a good sign! The line moved fairly quickly. The restaurant was fairly small with family style tables which means if there's more seats at your table, there will be other people seated with you. The menu is easy and everything is reasonably priced. Once we put in our order, the food was at our table in 10 minutes so it's definitely quick service. We all ordered smoked meat sandwiches and poutine! It was very good, but not out of this world good. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the bread they used, but overall- I would recommend the place! There are a lot of cute shops around so you can walk off your meal right afterwards :)"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of smoked meat (and if you aren't you damned well should be) then this is a must-visit location when you visit Montreal. 

Our group always hits Schwartz's on the way out of town for a couple of sandwiches each so we can enjoy fatty, smokey goodness all the way to Vermont.  

It's a wee bit out of the way, but the tremendously tasty meat makes it a must."}
{"text":"so... basically if you -must- try schwartz's (and you probably should if you're a tourist) get there when they open. there aren't enough seats or enough shelter so you'll be standing in the rain, the cold, and whatever weather montreal has to offer. (that's all, right?) we walked right by it and kept on going because we weren't \"hungry\" yet... i could have made myself eat if i knew coming back 45 minutes later meant waiting 45 minutes on top of that.

the good thing about standing in line is that i had the opportunity to listen to a native talk to other natives that had never been there about what to order. here's what we got: smoked meat plate, fries, pickles, and cott cherry soda. here's what i learned. 

SMOKED MEAT. do not get the smoked meat plate for two people. three people, that would work. for two, it's a lot and getting individual sandwiches is CHEAPER. they serve fresh sliced bread with it. 

FRIES. do not get the fries. if you think you can knock out to local food groups (poutine) keep looking. they don't have it here. save the room for the meat plate you just ordered despite my recommendation.

PICKLES. definitely get a pickle but be warned, it's a la carte and not cheap. 

SODA. definitely get the cott cherry soda. there's something about it that enhances everything else.

that is all. eat up."}
{"text":"As if it is avoidable to eat here... been to montreal twice and Schwartz 4 times. Smoked meat is awesome love the simplicity and the experience when i am here. Cool place, come in a party of two or less you will have a seat in less than 10 minutes. Great attitudes, having a good time and truly a rewarding meal for any day."}
{"text":"Lives up to its hype. Very very good, we got one smoked sandwich to share and then ordered one more"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and they were always busy. Just go for the classic and don't forget to try their fries and their pickles. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here last year while visiting in Montreal. The guidebook I had highly recommended it and I wasn't disappointed in the least. My smoked sandwich was sumptuous and the fries were greasy but perfect. 
When I return to Montreal this will be on my to- do list!"}
{"text":"Schwartz's is arguably the most famous deli in Montreal. It's menu proudly lists a who's who in entertainment, including Celine Dion - who I hear is now a part-owner of this iconic albeit overly touristy restaurant.

Expect to queue for a while (though it moves quickly) with the hordes of tourists to grab a seat at one of a dozen or so shared and packed tables in a chaotic and rather run down dining room. Sounds delightful, ha, not really, but oh does that sandwich make up for the pain of the experience.

The smoked meat, which is similar to American corn beef or British salt beef, is delicious. My sandwich overflowed with meaty goodness. It was the perfect mix of fat and lean meat served on smallish pieces of rye bread and some mustard. The beef was so tender it easily fell apart and I wound up eating it with a fork! There are other Jewish \"inspired\" dishes on offer (it is unclear if this place is kosher, I assume it is not), but almost everyone went with the smoked meat.

Swartz's serves some of the best deli sandwiches I've had and can easily match anything you'd find in a deli-mecca like NYC. Definitely worth a trip!"}
{"text":"The service is great! If you don't speak French they will help you out.

Food: I got the smoke meat sandwich for takeout and I've been to a lot of really good delis before, as I am a New Yorker. And this one blows them out of the water. Seriously! The smoked meat is so flavorful and tender and the pieces of fat are so juicy and add even more flavor to the sandwich. The bread is light and delicious and the crust is not too hard. The sandwich literally just melts in your mouth. The mustard adds just the right amount of tang to the sandwich. And the meat . . . there so much meat on the sandwich! Do not come in here thinking that you're going to share this with somebody else because this is a one person only sandwich.
Such a treat!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to Schwartz's but I'd rather be at Katz's in the lower east side or the late, lamented Carnegie Deli. Don't get me wrong: the smoked meat (stateside we'd call it pastrami) is excellent though the choice of whether to serve you lean, fatty or in between seems to be dictated more by what's on the end of the roast than special pieces the carver has put aside. 

But I wanted some spicy mustard, a slice of cheese for my sandwich and a wider choice of sides and those things were missing. Still felt like I'd taken a few months off my life eating a small sandwich, so I guess I shouldn't complain.

Fun fact: on an early evening in February, fully half the diners were Chinese. Not Chinese-Canadian or Chinese-American but Chinese-Chinese, some wearing garb from mainland Chinese colleges."}
{"text":"Awesome smoked meat in a timeless setting.  I'm not a slaw fan, but their slaw is great:  sweet and not creamy."}
{"text":"Came back a year later because we were Jonesing for that sandwich. Still just as good maybe better then the last time. We got two sandwiches this time because I was not going to share. I remembered that I really liked the mustard they used so this time I bought my own bottle...and it was worth it. We also got an order of fries which were amazing as well. The owner/co-owner/wife of owner what have you was there and she helped things move along quite quickly. The price is very reasonable especially since we are from New York. I would put this up against Katz Deli or the Carnegie Deli Sam'mich any day and not only would it hold it's ground it would beat them. Katz and Carnegie both charge roughly $24 for one of their sandwiches but Schwartz though half the size is a bargain at $7... Schwartz, if you are reading this, that is not an invitation to jack up your prices. Stay humble and true....greed is a bitter taste."}
{"text":"Came here with my dad he thought I was crazy for never hearing about this place lol. Came here early didn't have to wait hours in line like I've seen others have to do . Took the smoke meant sandwich was great compared to the ones I have had in the past, best in the word tho I can't say . Worth trying for sure ."}
{"text":"I can't say that I appreciated the crowded, dirty hyped up diner as much as all of the other people. The food wasn't particularly expensive and we had to share an already cramped table with some random strangers. It kind of reminded me of eating in China. Smoked meat was a-ok but the skinny sausage we tried was less than ok. All in all, I'm glad that the line moved faster than it looked and we were in and out within half an hour. I was starting to feel claustrophobic by that point. No thanks."}
{"text":"Good, but not by NYC standards. Good on its own. Nothing fancy, cash only. Average for deli service. There are more exciting restaurants in the neighborhood unless you are craving Jewish deli."}
{"text":"Have you ever been so excited to go somewhere because you have heard and read such great things about it?  Well, a visit to Schwartz's Deli was #1 on my restaurant priority list for our Montreal trip.  As expected, the place was packed when we arrived for dinner.  Fortunately, we only had to wait outside for 10 minutes before getting seated.

Enjoyed the ambiance of the deli.  Impressive how things appear chaotic with all the people milling around everywhere.  Staff makes the chaos disappear because they are very fast and efficient.  Food comes out quickly.

Ordered the Smoked Meat sandwich.  The smoked meat was flavorful.  Plenty of meat inside the sandwich.  Was not too crazy about the Rye bread that it came on.  

Overall, I found Schwartz's to be good.  There was no \"WOW\" factor though.  Perhaps my expectations were too sky high??  

Do I recommend making a stop here when in Montreal?  Absolutely!!  They are a Montreal institution and landmark!!  You never know who you might find here!"}
{"text":"While I know that pretty much anyone who has lived or visited Montreal knows about this place, my review is what you may not know about them.  Having been a long time Plateau resident, I have eaten from here many many times.  Now being a local you would not be caught dead standing in line to eat here, how do you do it, you ask.  Easy eat there at off hours, plan a meal in the evening, (anytime after 5 is just fine usually), late night is even better so maybe plan on a late night snack after say the movies or bar hopping.  Don't eat there, or if you must ask for the counter, the tables are what holds up the works and keeps people lined up for a long time. If you can take it to go, the inside is not all that amazing anyway, so if it is warm out, plan to take your meal out doors, or take it home.  Also if you want to ensure some better service be a good tipper. I have always tipped (yes even for take out), the reception I get there is the best, so dish out a couple of bucks and you will not wait."}

{"text":"I went on a Saturday just before lunch time and there was a line of people waiting outside of the store which I believe is a normal thing, I wasn't bothered by the wait because I was drawn there by the reputation and my curiosity out weighed my impatience.  
When I got to the front I ordered a smoked meat sandwich with a side of pickle and fries. I absolutely loved it. The meat is the best smoked meat I have ever had and the pickle went really well with it. The fries are tasty and crispy. 
May I add, this sandwich killed my hangover which is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Super good!! Heard so much good reviews that this was a must try spot for me! Luckily we friends and i planned it so we can have it for brunch/early lunch to avoid the long wait! We arrived around10:45ish, lots of open seating. My friend and i ordered the smoke brisket fat style! My other friends ordered the lean meat last time and said it was super dry, so make sure you order the fatty one! The meat was so tender and a bit juicy!  Mellt in your outh status! As for the sides we ordered the spicy peppers and cole slaw! Both good! 

Enjoy  ^_^"}
{"text":"Don't come here for ambiance, just come for the meat. There aren't a lot of choices on the menu so be prepared to have a smoked meat sandwich.  The taste of everything was great but I found the meat a bit dry.  The cole slaw was great as were the pickles; you need them to cut the dryness of the sandwich.  In the end, I'd prefer the NYC equivalent but I was glad I made it to Schwartz's; it was worth the wait in the sun."}
{"text":"the meat is juicy and taste fine, eatery environment is quite normal, customer service is not standout and just okay."}
