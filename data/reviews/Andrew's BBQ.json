{"text":"Very disappointed. I arrived at Andrew's at approximately 7:50 PM for a late dinner. The sign on the door says they close at 9pm yet the entire dining room was closed (very unwelcoming). I placed my order with a less than enthused cashier and even left a tip since I was under the impression that me being there was an inconvenience. I ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with the green chili Mac n cheese to go so I could get out of their hair. I drove the 1/2 mile to my house and began my feast. I was immediately disappointed. The bread was extremely soggy and the meat its self was Luke warm at best. I attempted to eat the Mac n cheese but it was so cold that it nearly broke the cheap plastic fork they give you. Needless to say, I will never be back to Andrews BBQ nor will I ever recommend his restaurant. A piece of advice, new customers can walk in at any time of day... If it was my restaurant I would ensure that my restaurant and food were consistent for every customer. Thanks for the waste of $10!"}
{"text":"Barbecue is a bit of an iffy thing for me, at least in the Phoenix area.  I have tasted some great barbecue, but they tend to be quite a drive for me.  I tend to avoid the chains and, as much as I love some of their food, Bill Johnson's has always lacked.

So, a while back, I noticed a little unassuming restaurant open up in my neighborhood.  Up to then I had been occasionally going to another local chain that had a place near me, but was often turned off by the attitude of the employees, despite the food being pretty good.  It was time for something new.  

And what a happy person I am.

Over the last few months, I have been happy to enjoy pork, chicken and beef from this place, and regularly try to stop by on Wednesday for their excellent wings.  Now, we're not talking about little, dried up chicken wings; we're talking big ones, not cut into little pieces, and with their very own wing sauce on it.

The pulled pork sandwiches are served with their delicious cole slaw right on the sandwich, the regular smoked chicken is flavorful even without the sauce, and the briscuit is amazing.  And, yes, the ribs are great, too.  No rubber band texture; you can practically pick it right off the bone.

Not in the mood for barbecue?  Friday nights in fish fry, and Saturdays they are featuring a New Orleans-themed menu, including catfish and shrimp poboys - which I unfortunately haven't had a chance to try yet, since they sell out rather quickly.

So, yes, Tempe, there is a barbecue place worth going to.  And the staff?  Happily, friendly and talkative.  Nothing like people happy to see you frequenting their establishment."}
{"text":"Tasty BBQ ribs...good sauces...awesome cornbread, moist like cake!  I would stay away from the green chili Mac n Cheese as it was overcooked and the cole slaw was rather tasteless."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Andrew's for a long time, but finally got around to it last night.  Not sure if it was the location, the mixed yelp reviews, but I was definitely skeptical about it.  Good BBQ is amazing, but bad BBQ is a supreme letdown.

Walking in you immediately smell the smoke, the meat...it smells fantastic.  The place was completely empty (which can be a warning sign at some places).  The menu was large and a bit overwhelming - it all sounds good, so we knew we'd have a hard time picking one or two things.  

We had *amazing* service.  Dana was fantastic.  From the moment she greeted us, we knew we were in good hands.  We had just started perusing the menu, and she offered to give us her \"spiel\"  - she warned us she did have one if we were interested.  She then gave a very thorough, but quick run through of the highlights of the menu - different options depending on what exactly we wanted.  She gave us advice and did NOT steer us wrong.  

We settled in on the bbq sampler, a half slab of ribs and our sides - green chile mac n cheese, garlic mashed potatoes and spicy cowboy beans.  Oh, and cornbread.  If it sounds like too much food...it was, and I don't regret it even a little.  We were advised that it would reheat well if we had leftovers.  For the record, it reheated very well as lunch the next day.  

The ribs were deliciously smoky, great flavor.  They are a little tougher than some places (think they were more St Lous style as opposed to our preferred baby backs, but that's our preference), which wasn't great, but certainly not bad.  The flavor compensated well for it.  

The pulled pork was good, the bbq brisket quite tasty and the pulled bbq chicken was surprisingly good.  I'm of the mindset that chicken is the least attractive option at any bbq joint, but this was very good.  I can see how each of those would make for a great bbq sandwich (or sliders, which we were told was a good way to try each of them as well).

The cornbread was nicely moist, had a great flavor as well.

You lose a star for serving Pepsi products in my opinion...but I know others don't mind Pepsi.  We're just a Coke family and always will be.

Limited selection of beers, but they are decent - the usual domestics (Bud/Miller) as well as a selection of 4Peaks brews - Kiltlifter, 8th St Ale and Hop Knot (HK in a can!) - not to mention $2 PBR.  That'll do...that'll do.

Supposedly they have cupcakes as well, made by a former employee who still sells to Andrews so Andrews can serve them.  We didn't try them, but the flavors sounded really good.

We'll definitely be back.  It's not the best BBQ in the Phoenix area, but it's certainly respectable and definitely the best I've had in the Tempe area (by far).  Don't be scared off by the empty restaraunt.  It's worth a try.    It's 3.5 star quality, minus the star for Pepsi, add a star for Dana..."}
{"text":"Stopped in after seeing the reviews and being in the mood for ribs. Very friendly staff - walked us through the menu and made suggestions. We had the Rib Platter for 2 - and everything was wonderful. Will be back for sure to try everything else :)"}
{"text":"My wife and are are BBQ snobs from Fort Worth. This place reminds us of home! Great food. Chicken and brisket are the bomb! Baked Potato salad is to die for and service is excellent. Stop in and tell Dana she's the greatest, cause she is!"}
{"text":"Andrew's BBQ was a near success. I got the Q sampler, which offered pulled chicken, pork, beef brisket, 2 ribs, 2 sides and cornbread. It totaled 12.95 which is a killer deal for everything. I have a big appetite and I didn't finish everything entirely. 

The best was probably the pork. It was tender and had great flavor and was not very fatty which I appreciate because I sometimes find pulled pork way too fatty. 

The next best was the brisket, which was thinly sliced. I noticed on the menu that it had thick sliced meal as well. It was really tender and pretty juicy. There was a bit of excess fat, but as a person who doesn't like gnawing on fat at all, I found it totally acceptable and edible. 

The most disappointing was the chicken, which is a bummer because BBQ chicken is so variable. It was shredded to nearly paste, and wasn't very flavorful. It was also sort of wet, and semisolid. I'd say avoid that. 

The ribs were amazing and meaty! Very little fat, and quite tender. Definitely needed some extra sauce for me (I'm a sauce fiend). They only had 2 sauce options, and they were pretty mediocre. 

They were really molasses heavy, which I was glad about, because I try to avoid that ole' high fructose corn syrup. They claimed there was a spicy and regular but they tasted nearly identical. I chose the spicy, just because it had a little extra flavor. 

I got the green chili mac and cheese which was delicious. It wasn't too hot or too mild and tasted pretty fresh, and I also got coleslaw which was some of the best I've had in ages. The cornbread was doughy, cold and offered very little to the meal.

My girlfriend got a burger and mashed potatoes. I tried the taters and they were great, but maybe not with the burger. She said the the burger was pretty solid too and quite fresh, 4/5. 

Dana was also quite nice and helpful. I watched her give some people the hookups because they were unhappy with their order. She was really cool, so be nice to her too!

Beer selection was limited, and a little pricey but who can say no to an ice cold beer with a platter of food.

TL;DR 4/5 Really good stuff! I'd recommend it!

Definitely try:
Brisket, pulled pork, and ribs, and coleslaw.

Give it a whirl:
Green chili mac n cheese.

Avoid:
Pulled chicken."}
{"text":"OMG, to die for! My new favorite BBQ place *^_^*  

Ribs can be ordered in 1/3 rack, 1/2 rack, and full rack. Awesome and lip-smackin! The ribs were so tender and fell off the bones easily. Andrew's has a couple of BBQ sauces available. I loved dipping mine in the Hot Andrew's BBQ Sauce! 

There are some great side dishes listed, and we ordered a few. Although the Spicy Cowboy Beans were ok, the Baked Potato Salad and the Green Chile Mac 'n Cheese were standouts; I would definitely recommend! 

They have daily made cupcakes, and today's cupcake was cherry chocolate with pink whipped cream. Heavens to betsy! It was sooo moist, and with cherry filling on the bottom it almost screamed to be eaten with a spoon.

The owners were very personable and friendly. I will definitely spread the gospel of Andrew's BBQ!"}
{"text":"BIG pulled pork sandwich, succulent, delicious, priced-right."}
{"text":"We were trying to choose a new place for lunch at work and this was mentioned. We all LOVED it! (that is saying a lot!) We ordered off the online menu and I called it in (she was VERY friendly) it was ready in less than 10min and was hot and delicious!!! It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to go there fairly often. We will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ places in town for sure. Beef brisket is my favorite, along with best BBQ sauce in the town ( Andrew's Spicy BBQ sauce)."}
{"text":"I was optimistic when we walked in - lots of variety on the menu, and it smelled heavenly! The staff was friendly, and it all looked very promising. Ordered the full rack of ribs for takeout - was promptly informed of the special they were having on that item, which would also get me two sides and two pieces of cornbread for two dollars less than the normal price of the ribs. Sounded like a great deal!

I was disappointed when we got home and started eating, however. The ribs were pleasingly meaty, but that's about the best I can say for them. There was *no* sauce on them and no flavor at all! The lack of sauce may be my fault. The cashier asked if I wanted more sauce on the ribs to go - assuming that there was already sauce on them, I said no. If I'd known, I would have definitely asked for the extra sauce! Maybe it's just me, but I don't think barbecue sauce should be optional when you order ribs at a barbecue joint! The seasoned fries were OK - nothing wrong with them, but nothing to write home about, although my parents loved them. The cornbread was delicious, sweet and moist, but I seem to be the only one in my family who was impressed by it. 

We may come back to try some of the appetizers, like the Wisconsin cheese curds and the sweet potato fries - but we won't be ordering ribs here again. I'm annoyed enough by the barbecue sauce issue to be inclined to rate low, but the meal wasn't bad - just uninspiring. Three stars."}
{"text":"I like this place... It isn't knock your sox off, finger lickin, can't live without it BBQ. But it's good, Fast, clean and fresh. What more can you ask for? 
No Wide varietiy of BBQ sauces, but the eclectic selection of unique cupcakes/pastries is a nice touch. The friendly staff makes you feel pretty comfortable as well (considering the atmosphere is a little cold and un-inviting.) But it's very clean and that's worth its weight in gold. 

The French fries are so perfect, crispy, and flavorful that I have withdrawals from time to time just thinkin about em.  And the green chili mac n cheese is delightful. Go with a pulled pork sandwich, fries and green chili mac n cheese. After trying other dishes these items stand out most. DON'T expect rib paradise or mouthwatering brisket here folks. However, I've been a regular customer for over a year now and intend on keeping it that way. 
Eat well, live well and surround yourselves with ones who do. -Cheers"}
{"text":"After reading all the raves about the green chili mac & cheese it was a must have - and then immediate regret. The green chilies were chewy and not peeled properly and the cheese in the mac was grainy and gritty. Yuck. Mac & cheese is by definition...cheesy and smooth. Not this. Horrible. The good side was the pulled pork sandwich and the hot BBQ was pretty darn good. All in all when I want good BBQ my choice would be Honey Bears first. But if I'm hard up and just gotta have some BBQ, I would consider Andrew's again."}
{"text":"Andrew's BBQ continues to be one of my go to spots for quick, delicious food.  In addition to the ribs I would also recommend the brisket.  The wait staff is always friendly and helpful, especially when I can't decide what to get."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The last time I got the pulled pork, but sampled my wife's plate of ribs and brisket. The best meat is the pulled pork hands down. The pork is tender and has little fat. The brisket is ok, but was a bit too greasy. I've had better brisket

The beans and baked potato salad are good.

The first time I ate there, I had a big baked potato topped with pulled pork. That was a cheap and hearty meal ($7). I'd go back just for this meal.

I'd like to head back and just focus on the ribs to see how they stack up to other places.."}
{"text":"On entering Andrew's BBQ Restaurant in Tempe I was transported back to kindergarten, the happiest time in my childhood: hardwood chairs and tables, red floor, white walls covered with crayon drawings. I expected to see my teacher seated at her upright piano leading us in song. There was no piano, but Jody, event coordinator and restaurant manager, was as cheerful and informative as the teacher of my memories. I should have asked her to sing \"I Am A Little Teapot\" with me. Maybe next time.

     A huge blackboard above the counter displayed the menu. The item that popped right out at us was Wisconsin Cheese Curds with Ranch Dressing ($4.95). We also ordered a BBQ Sampler Plate ($12.95) and a house-made cupcake ($2). Our food arrived quickly. Portions were large: the cheese curds could easily have fed four.  Our sampler plate consisted of 4 pork ribs, a container each of BBQ chopped chicken, beef brisket and pork. For our two sides we had selected baked potato salad and slaw. There was also a wedge of cornbread. 

     The cheese curds were out of this world, deep fried in a beer batter. Cheese curds are fresh young cheddar cheese in natural form before being processed into blocks and aged. They're mostly found in places that have cheese factories, since they should be eaten soon after being taken out of the vat  - but happily they've been showing up in the Valley. They're less chewy than mozzarella, with a lovely mild flavor. It's worth a trip to Andrew's just to have these!

     The BBQ was excellent too. It's cooked over cherry wood imported from northern Michigan. All the chopped meats were moist and tender, served in their jus rather than slathered with BBQ sauce. Our only quibble was that the same rub seemed to have been used on all three, thus making their taste similar. The ribs were falling off the bone, but just this side of dry. There were two sauces, regular and spicy - not overly sweet or tomatoey. The baked potato salad was a treat, with bits of real bacon and scallions. One of the nicest surprises was that the moist, caky cornbread was served with real butter, and there were packets of honey on the table. We did pig-out on the cheese curds, so we finished only half of our platter. We took the cupcake home with us and had it as a mid-afternoon snack. From the many flavors available, we had chosen a chocolate-cherry. The pink frosting was topped with a maraschino cherry; while sweet it went nicely with the chocolate cupcake which was less sugary.

     Other items I'd like to try:
 Loaded Fries ($6.95) - Choice of BBQ Meats, Cheese, Onions & Ranch
 BBQ Baker ($6.95) - Large baked spud loaded with cowboy beans, choice of BBQ meat, onions, sour cream and cheddar cheese. (Jody says this is HUGE)
 Green Chili Mac & Cheese (one of the available sides) or $1.75.

     Andrew's started out as a catering company, then added the restaurants (there's also one in Mesa) about a year and a half ago. They do catering for the Phoenix zoo and also private parties. If you happen to be having 100 people over to your house, for $13.95 per person you can get a whole smoked pineapple pig, injected with teriyaki pineapple juice, slow cooked for fourteen hours and hand carved at the buffet. Too bad our condo is so small...."}
{"text":"The brisket is incredible! The ribs are fantastic. The regular barbecue sauce is good if you like a sweet sauce, and it is not too sweet, it is a little tangy, but I prefer the spicy one, and it is not too spicy. The pork and chicken are excellent as well. The fries are crispy and well seasoned.  The green chile mac&cheese is good.  This is one of the best restaurants in the Phoenix area, and it is absolutely the best barbecue."}
{"text":"Be it a good or bad experience I have never felt the need to Yelp until tonight. Best BBQ place in town at Andrew's - great food, ambiance and service. The table next to us had some rowdy kids and a pork slider 6 pack ended up scattered on the floor, only to quickly be replaced with a smile (all at closing time by the way). I myself have been in the restaurant business for a long time and I have the misfortune of over-analyzing everything - this is a clean and efficient first class operation. Not to mention a first class local beer list to my surprise! Keep it up Dana and Francisco we will be back. Cheers!"}
{"text":"While the seating and décor are strictly utilitarian, its kinda cool that its an out of the way. The food is really good, I have been several times now and never disappointed."}
{"text":"I support local business as much as possible......but $9.50 for a turkey burger and a shot glass of cole slaw was a bit pricey to me. It was a great tasting burger dont get me wrong, prices are slightly high I think."}
{"text":"Great beef bbq sandwich!
Pulled pork was good, not great.
Cole Slaw: top notch.
Buns for sandwiches are marginal at best.  

Usually I'm not a fan of BBQ beef brisket, but they did a great job here. I'll be back for more"}
{"text":"The taste is fantastic!  I've been to Andrew's multiple times, and it's always good.  My fav is the pulled pork and the 'green chili' mac-n-cheese.  The all-you-can-eat lunch (on Tuesdays, I think) is an excellent chance to try all the meats/sides that you'd like.  The BBQ sauce is great, although the Hot BBQ sauce is even better.  Super service, and low prices will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"food was not hot, their hot bbq sauce appeared to be regular and their regular sauce had just a sweet taste.  Ribs were very tender but not very flavorful, the pulled pork was average, as was the beef brisket.  The chicken was tasteless pieces of dark meat mostly.  A cold corn muffin was dry.  The fries were good, the mac-n-cheese fair and the potato salad undercooked.  Overall, a bad experience."}
{"text":"Simple digs, simple menu, limited hours. This place is designed to do what it does and it does it nicely. There was a thin haze of smoke in the entire place which is always a good sign in a place that claims pit-smoked meats. I ordered a pound of brisket and half rack of St Louis ribs to go. It wasn't crowded as it was before 11:30 on a Wednesday. There were 2 guys with beards and plaid shirts that seemed to be enjoying their meal quite a bit while I waited a very short time for my order to be cut; the guy even gave me the rib tips so I could really taste the rub/smoke.

The brisket was very heavily smoked, some would say dry, but very good when fresh out of the smoker, which seems to be the intent. They use a mesquite/red oak blend that is very interesting, and a really good bark of dry rub compliments the natural smoke with sweetness and spice. It's quite good, and while not the best I've ever had, you can tell that this is someone's 'favorite' rub; it took testing and tweaking, and it shows.

The ribs were amazing. A similar rub, but the contrast of textures and flavors was like something from a suckling pig. The person who cut them threw in the end-pieces of the rack and they were just a tour of everything good about pork, enhanced by the smoke and spice.

I'd passed this place up several times, mostly because they were closed when I usually visit the grocery store it's next to. I made a special trip to try them and was not disappointed. The menu is limited, but what they have is what you want."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I go about once a week.  I get the pulled pork sandwich every time and I rotate the sides.  Try the mac-n-cheese - it's AWESOME!  Oh, and BTW, definitely get the spicy BBQ sauce.  Thank God I finally found a good BBQ place in Tempe."}
{"text":"If you're in this part of town and you love BBQ, don't miss this place!  The sampler platter is tasty and a generous portion...made to share."}
{"text":"The cashier was very friendly.  That's about the best thing I can say.  Very disappointed in the quality of the food.  Pull pork sandwich was cold in spots and had a huge cold glop of fat in the middle.  The sauce?  Meh.  The beans appeared to be old and over cooked.  Sad when I can honestly say I've had much better BBQ at chain restaurants such as Lucille's and Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"I have used Andrew's to deliver BBQ to our gatherings at different community parks in the Tempe area and continue to be pleased. The customer service and ease of ordering is amazing. The amount of food you get per person is a great deal! The delivery drivers are always punctual and polite. The food arrives hot and exactly as ordered. Sure beats slaving over a hot grill in AZ summers and our guests always enjoy it! Would, and do, recommend them to our friends for catering needs. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was delicious and fast! Also it is priced really fair. Got the trio slider and thought it was great. The garlic mashed potatoes were also very good! (My husband tried the mac n cheese, so I branched out. The mac n cheese was good too!) the service was friendly as well. The prickly pear tea was also good! EVERYTHING WAS GOOD!! We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I have checked out many places that say they have the best BBQ and have been disappointed.  But this place not only have great food, but great service.  The kitchen offers many options and the specials are always great (blue cheese burgers, bacon wrapped hot dogs-which are now on the menu!)  They  have a spicy bbq sauce that not many places offer or that really isn't as spicy as i would like.  The food is abundant for the price, sometimes I can't even finish the sandwich and one side.  The green chile mac and cheese is great to pair with any sandwich and you need to bbq it up or you may think the meat is a little dry, but it is not!  It is tender, juicy, and could be eaten alone, but the BBQ does the trick!"}
{"text":"This review is for a wedding catering tasting.

The building looks unassuming, and I'd probably have passed by if I weren't looking for it.  Inside we were greeted right away, offered soft drinks, and asked to sit down.  Other couples drifted in, and soon our contact came out to begin sampling appetizers.  She took the time to make sure we knew what each morsel was, and returned shortly with the main course samples.  Everything was delicious!  We have some major decisions to make now ;)

As everyone was mulling over their plates and making notes, our host made the rounds to answer any questions we may have thought up.  She'd explained that they were very busy with events and covering for an injured owner, but she still clearly felt it was important to make each of us feel like we had her ear.  

If I had to make some suggestions, the first would be to outline the event in the introduction.  We sat still waiting for instruction, but didn't really know what to expect at any point.  The second would be to answer the individual questions in an open forum format.  If someone at a table had a good (or common) question, I'd have liked to have her answer it for everyone to hear.  I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be asking, and I think that conversation would have snowballed into a nice information-fest.  

The ambiance was a nice casual BBQ joint.  Pigs painted on the window wearing bibs, farm decor inside, large chalkboard menu.  I'd like to  come back for lunch sometime!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome, really nice and helpful! 

Split a full rack with my boyfriend. Ribs are good, but the house spicy bbq sauce made their ribs great! 

Get the green chile Mac and cheese as a side! The seasoned fries are good as well if Mac and cheese isn't your thing."}
{"text":"Noticed a full parking lot at their other location at Southern/Dobson, so one day after alot of yard work... decided to head back to this closer location to our home.

Unlike the other location, unfortunately there is a lack of people eating inside... but quote the BF.. \"I'd take good food over atmosphere\".

The green chile pork tacos special of the day, it wasn't bbq but who cares, it was that good.  I just kept stealing the bbq tastes off my bf's plate (beef brisket still wins!)... this time got the baked potato salad.. nifty presentation, I'm going to steal that idea for a future backyard party."}
{"text":"Awesome smokey taste, tender, and items like fried ochra make this a must: recommended. The ribs were fantastic."}
{"text":"My five stars are for Andrew's RIBS, which are hands down THE BEST RIBS in Tempe (and reasonably priced to boot!). I will definitely be back to try their other dishes. It's a very clean unpretentious luncheonette style place with fast friendly service. I had just about given up hope of finding any good BBQ in Tempe before discovering this gem. (Lucille's in the Tempe Marketplace is the ultimate overpriced phony ripoff and should be shut down for crimes against  soul food). Andrew's BBQ on E. Guadalupe, next to Albertson's supermarket, is the real deal: I'm talking SIX man-sized pork ribs, every one PLUMP  with juicy pink meat, plus a side and a beer for $15 !! Even those makeshift BBQ kitchens that pop up in warehouse districts of Phoenix that open at 11am and close at 2pm won't give you that good a deal! 

Just a few minor fixable quibbles: They only offer one BBQ sauce, which happens to be delicious, but some folks like a variety. Collard Greens, one of my favorite soul foods, is not offered as a side..yet! The only meat combination they offer is ribs and chicken. Pulled pork, Brisket and Sausage must be purchased separately and I will be going back to do just that!"}
{"text":"Great brisket, awesome green chile Mac and cheese, love the Carolina Mustard BBQ sauce. Will definitely be back often."}
{"text":"Like others, my wife and I were excited to try this place out. Our first clue of the quality was that our take-out order would be ready in 5-10 min. To me that says that it's been sitting on a hot shelf all day waiting for the next unlucky guest.
Arriving, the place was empty (next clue). It was a sunday around dinner time, which usually other places are packed. The staff was very friendly, which is to their advantage because I actually felt bad for them; I wouldn't want to be serving something so poor qualtiy to paying customers. 
Anyway, the thick cut beef brisket was dry, bland, and there was no smoke ring, something I always look for in BBQ. The BBQ beans had to be Bush's canned beans, my cornbread felt like it had been dipped in water it was so soggy, tasted kind of chemically also.
My wife's pulled pork sandwich actually grossed her out. It was slimy and bland. Her coleslaw she said, \"no comment\". We also had the fried okra which was ok. Tasted like fried food, nothing to brag about.
I don't like giving nice people bad reviews, but it was a total waste of money, never trying this place again."}
{"text":"I am in Tempe this week for work, my company's offices are in Tempe, and was didn't have a lot of time for lunch so I looked for a nearby BBQ that I could get some takeout from.  I love BBQ, I do my own BBQ almost weekly, and the great thing about BBQ is that you can generally get something better than fast food in a hurry.

I ordered a half pound of brisket, and a side of corn bread.  I also got a couple small cups of their original BBQ sauce on the side.  The first thing that jumped out at me, is that their corn bread is simply that, corn bread.  It isn't packed with things like green chilis that IMO detract from what corn bread is supposed to be.  A definite plus in my book.

The brisket was juicy, perfectly cooked and easily passed the pull / tug test.  Even better though was that it had a nice bark and the flavor of the bark really complimented the flavor of the meat.  I might have liked a little more of a smoke ring but it was still a very good brisket.  The sauce was tasty, but to be totally honest I didn't really use that much, good BBQ doesn't need sauce, and I ate most of my brisket without any sauce at all."}
{"text":"The meat was very tasty and tender, but I did not like the cherry wood flavor.  I have not been back since they opened in Tempe, but I've heard that they are using different wood now.

But if you're looking for good tender and tasty BBQ, try Andrew's"}
{"text":"I'm still drooling a little bit.

The only real problem with Andrews is choosing what to order - the entire menu looks and is delicious. The pulled pork is perfectly juicy. The green chile mac and cheese has exactly the right amount of green chile. The fried fish (Fridays only) is expertly battered and fried. I could seriously hurt myself in this place.

And, the great thing is, Andrews is exactly the way a BBQ place should be. Unassuming storefront with a wide-open space almost totally unadorned. Scuffed floors and plastic baskets. A garage door-sized view into an immaculate kitchen. All locally raised (Shamrock farms) meats. No pretense whatsoever - just lots and lots of great food at great prices. 

First time customers try the triple slider option - a bbq chicken, pulled pork and beef brisket sampler in slider form.

I'm sorry, Honeybear's: I think you might have been trumped for best Tempe BBQ."}
{"text":"Great service and food - portions are huge."}
{"text":"Not good.  Overcooked mush pork, brisket no flavor but cooked well.  Not even sure it was smoked.  Chicken and ribs dry and flavorless.  The sides were good potatoes and mac n cheese.  The hot bbq sauce was good.  Nothing award winning about this place."}
{"text":"I have been looking for good bbq for a long time. I've tried Tom's and Honey Bear's but I guess it was ok since there wasn't really anything else. I finally stopped into Andrew's and thought I'd give it a shot. I tried the ribs and they were amazing! I could taste that they smoked them for a while and couldn't decide if I even wanted sauce or not. I ended up trying their hot sauce and was so good! I wish it was a little hotter but I liked it. The meat was so tender and it looked as if the sauce on the meat had caramelized, that was a treat for my eyes. I got a side of baked beans and french fries. Boy were the servings large! Me and my boyfriend went back and we both got the brisket and we were both so pleased with it! First of all the servings are huge, the meat was so juicy and flavorful. I tried the coleslaw and cheese curds this time and wow! The service was great too! The waitress' were very nice to us and made our experiences enjoyable! I've been so pleased with Andrew's bbq that I felt like I had been settling for less this whole time when I had a great bbq place in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Nothing stellar, in my opinion, but a solid choice for a hearty and reasonably-priced lunch.

For those who've been here before: Andrew's has undergone a bit of a makeover in the past month or two. They've streamlined their menu, cutting it down to meat by the pound, sides/desserts, and a daily special (more of an aesthetic change, really - whereas before their menu was a chalkboard cluttered with all different permutations of their items, now they keep it simple). This, along with the fact that they now weigh their meat un-sauced, is a definite improvement in my eyes and means more BBQ and less clutter for the customer.

Going along with their hip new vibe, they seem to have added cold-brew coffee to the menu.

Downsides: (1) the minimalist-eclectic decor - a smorgasbord of wall adornments ranging from ASU posters to a \"Practice Safe Lunch - Use Condiments\" sign - can leave you feeling a little forlorn when the place is empty, and (2) the sides. Like most thin and crispy fries, they're only delicious during the critical five-minute window when they're still piping hot; as for the mac 'n' cheese, maybe I'm missing something, but it tastes to me like Velveeta and canned green chiles. (3) If you're looking for real heat or spice, this place probably isn't gonna do it. Their three sauces, a regular, a hot, and a Carolina mustard, are all good (the mustard's my favorite), but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"went here today with Rand H. for the last Tuesday of the month buffet.That is the only time they have it and that is a shame because it was great. They only had a few things but what was there was good. They had coleslaw , mashed potatoes , BBQ ribs , pulled pork  , baked beans , hamburger buns to make a sandwich with, They also had a whole roast pig that they were carving up right there at the buffet.As for dessert they had a peach cobbler that was also yumm. drinks are also included in the buffet and i chose to have a mango ice tea which was very good. So another great lunch and a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Quality, smoked brisket. It's simply amazing. I will be back for sure. Loved the cornbread and slaw too."}
{"text":"My two year old is obsessed with mac and cheese, so this place showed up on a Yelp search. Came in and the service was top-notch. Gave us a sample of the Mac and cheese to make sure my son would like it. Friendly and accommodating. And our meals? AMAZING."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place in Phoenix. I'm Texas born and raised and very picky on my BBQ. This makes me feel as close to home in the desert as I can get. Excellent service every damn time and mouth kicking flavor packed sandwiches."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area so I checked it out. great meal to satisfy a BBQ craving. I ordered a sampler and my wife had a beef brisket. the meat was flavored perfectly and a good temperature. they have kids' meals also. great cornbread and coleslaw as sides. they have fountain drinks so you can help yourself to more beverages. each table has 2 house BBQ sauces, both go well with any meat. it was a bit empty but the food came out fast. overall great dining!"}
{"text":"Great bbq place. I regret getting the green chile mac and cheese, but not because I didnt like it. On the contrary it was quite good. But I got a full pound of brisket which I could not stop shoveling into my mouth.

Standard fare, you get some bread with your bbq, sandwich buns in this case (some places do texas toast or wonder bread, here its the hamburger style buns).

I want to eventually try some of the other meats here, but I'm not sure how I'm going to with my mouth full of brisket."}
{"text":"How can you be a BBQ place and be so cheap? No real bbq joint is offering up chopped chicken thigh meat to its customers except Andrew. Thats the ultimate cheap shot. This is the first place in America to feature only thigh meat in its sandwiches and meanwhile your selling chicken breasts also. Only the cheapest of Chinese restaurants still use all thigh meat. 
   Next was the brisket and counter girl said brisket is the fattiest meat when i inquired about fat content....that leads me to believe the brisket would be an adventure in fat. This is strange cause texas bbq house sure knows how to make lean brisket. And although people like st. Louis style ribs, they are so much more cheaper than baby backs which is just another example of cheap Andrew. This place is a joke to BBQ lovers, but luckily for them they are in Arizona and people know nothing here about BBQ. This joint would get laughed out of the south."}
{"text":"After a fun morning at Comicon, the 11 year old wanted ribs. I googled Temle BBQ and Andrew's came up so we stopped by. I had the BBQ Sampler. The brisket (the 2/3 that wasn't fat) was delicious, the chicken was really good, and the brisket so tasty I brought some home for later! The ribs...were dry. I had to put sauce on every bite. Pretty disappointing for a barbecue spot. The cornbread was cold and a thicker consistency than I prefer (I like my cornbread warm and crumbly, the way granmda made it!). The baked beans were pretty standard and the coleslaw was a-ok. 

Overall, three stars. I'd definitely come back for the brisket, but pass on the ribs and cornbread for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite place for lunch when I went out to eat from working days, it was about a mile from my work place, and sometimes I went there with my co-workers to enjoy in there or take to go back to our work place. Sometimes, they have discount for grouping and they have good customer services! I definitely be back here for my lunch sometime when I am at works! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place on our anniversary, as we were both craving BBQ. Honestly, this is the best BBQ I've had in Arizona, possibly the best I've ever had. Go here. Get pulled pork or brisket. Go."}
{"text":"Randomly stopped by this place and was pleasantly surprised. Good ol fashion BBQ. Had pulled pork and coleslaw and the place was really clean."}
{"text":"Andrew's BBQ has unbelievably low prices for such delicious food. For around 10 dollars and less, you can choose from a variety of meats and sides. Their portions are quite filling too, I'd love to come here again when I'm really hungry.

I had the pulled pork BBQ sandwich, SO GOOD. The meat was so soft and flavorful and just plain yummy. I didn't think I'd finish the whole thing because it looked really big, but I ate it all, savoring every bite. I had the baked potato side, which was okay. If I ever come here again, I'd definitely get the sweet potato fries and regular fries! So hot and crunchy and soft at the same time. If you get the salad too, they also give you cornbread. I usually don't eat cornbread, but the stuff they have here is pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Rating is based on my first trip (take out) and compared to BBQ in the area.  I had a hankering for mac n cheese, so turned to yelp and saw people comment about the green chile mac n cheese at Andrew's.  The flavoring was amazing, but the noodles were your typical BBQ side, aka way overcooked and mushy.  Still far better than most, but wish you could actually taste the noodles!

My man and I shared the BBQ combo.  I can eat quite a bit, and this was a TON of food.  If you have your own buns, you could easily make three large sandwiches.  We got a side of the hot BBQ sauce and boy are we fans!  It could be spicier, but has enough of a kick to it to please us.  The brisket was likely my favorite, followed by the pulled pork and chicken, then the ribs (which weren't amazing, but still good).  Sides of mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, spicy cowboy beans, and cornbread.  All fantastic.  Cornbread was quite amazing.

We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Not good. Waited 15 minutes to order and 25 minutes for food. Brisket was like chewing leather and was almost cold. Mac and cheese were nothing special. Cornbread was more like ice cold yellow cake. I don't know what kind of low grade BBQ the Yelpers who gave this good marks are used to but it must be horrible. 

Highly disappointing as I was hoping for a new option for BBQ but this isn't it. Even the big chain places are better than this."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ place in Phoenix.  I've eaten here 5 times now and tried a few different things on the menu and have never left disappointed.  My favorite menu item is the BBQ Sampler.  You get plenty of food for the price and I can barely finish my dinner, you get that much.  Their Smokehouse Beans and Loaded Baked Potato Salad is a perfect compliment to your meal.  You get a nice slice of corn bread that is so moist and good you don't need butter or honey to put on it.  If you're in the neighborhood you do need to stop in for a bite.  My next dinner that looked good was the bacon wrapped hot dogs topped with cole slaw."}
{"text":"The lady who attended me got 6/10 for service.
I was one of three customers there..so it was quiet a little too quiet... I finally got my pulled pork sandwich(my fav)... It was the worst I've ever had ,it had no love,it was dry,it had no flavor... Very very disappointed... They need a smoker or a new cook or a new restaurant idea... Who messes up pulled pork"}
{"text":"I arrived around 10 minutes before noon to hopefully beat the lunch rush. I was the only one there. As I ate my lunch, 3 other customers arrived. There was no lunch rush. As far as the food...

...Simply put, disappointed. I decided to go with the sliders, pork - chicken - beef.  The pulled pork was mushy and left a gritty paste in my mouth. The bread was dry and boring. The beef was fatty and over cooked. Rather than being cut into little pieces, the beef was one large slice on a tiny bun. The chicken was dry. I had to add additional sauce to ask the meats to make them edible.

I think this is one of those places that people go once and never return. At least that describes me."}
{"text":"it's not amazing, but it is very good.  The ribs are meh, the brisket is good, the chickens good, and the pulled pork is very good. I lovedthegreen chili Mac and cheese. Decor is simple and you order at the counter."}
{"text":"Andrew's BBQ is the type of place that there is a rule in office if you go there for lunch you have to tell people who subscribe to special place list.  It doesn't matter if people have eaten their lunch they will still put in an order so they can have BBQ for dinner. 

The ribs are meaty, moist and delicious.  Every day they have special items like green chili pulled pork and hot links.  Both items are good btw.  

The moist brisket is also really good, have never tried the dry. The brisket also comes with buns.

For sides I have only tried the green chili mac and cheese.  It wasn't that good but the meat is so good I'm willing to over look it.  Even if it tasted fantastic I doubt I would get it anyways.

My advice is since they will run out of meat get there early."}
{"text":"After Honey Bear's disappointed one too many times (a shame because I was one of their earliest fans), my wife and I tried Andrew's BBQ. Very good beef brisket and chicken; pork was a little off. Quality sides, even if the cornbread is rather cake-y."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on Yelp and it did not steer me wrong. I went with a group of 6-7 guys last week and we all loved this place. It was delicious, very well-priced, fast, and the service was outstanding. The woman behind the counter is a machine and she's one of the best servicewomen I've ever had. I got the trio with a brisket sandwich, chopped chix, and the pulled pork with fries. All of it was awesome! I think I loved the chicken the best but I'm going back this weekend to try the ribs and other stuff. I'm upset I didn't find out about this place sooner. I love these restaurants that are popping up. Fast, but not fast food, just delicious food in a very simple setting. Go here now!

-Ethan"}
{"text":"Went back after a not so good first time.  The green Chile mac and cheese was the only good thing. The meat did not taste good at all and it was lukewarm at best.  Didn't taste fresh"}
{"text":"This was a pretty good barbecue joint.

I ordered the beef brisket meal with cornbread and jalapeno mac and cheese. The brisket was just slightly dry and tough, but with the spicy sauce, it tasted great. The cornbread was standard, and the jalapenos in the mac and cheese gave the side a nice flavor.

Definitely somewhere I'll be back to."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here a few nights ago and it was great.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and my wife had three sliders (one chicken one pork and one briskit).  They were all very good and moist. Portions were very large and we took some home.  The side of cowboy beans was very good and spicy.  We also had and order of  the sweet potato fries.  They were the best I have had and the order was huge more than enough to share.  We are fans and will be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm not hatin'...I'm just sayin' ...oh no.

I was all hyped up to try this place after reading the other Yelp reviews...but no. No. No. No. It wasn't the worst dining experience of my life, but all I could think while eating was, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" We ordered the BBQ Sampler in order to get a taste of everything. The results....

The highlights: very friendly staff; the ribs were okay; the hotlink, decent; the fries, workable; the brisket, edible; the corn bread, not bad.

The lowlights: the pulled pork, boring; the pulled chicken, yuck; the jalapeno mac & cheese, mushy and bland. None of the food seemed very fresh. And all of it was served at a temperature nowhere in the neighborhood of what I would call \"hot.\" Looks and feels like a daycare center inside.

Save yourself a trip. Don't believe the hype on this place; it's just average. I find no reason to return."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in phoenix area hands down. I love BBQ and since moving to the valley back in 98 have had a hard time finding any good bbq. I hate chain restaturants like Famous Daves and am glad I found Andrews. Huge portions and great BBQ sauce. Highly recommend pulled pork sandwich.."}
{"text":"pros:
- great-tasting BBQ
- yummy custom BBQ sauces
- excellent, attentive service

cons:
- missing some smokiness
- pulled pork could be more flavorful

bottom line: great little joint with BBQ that holds its own.

i was pleasantly surprised by andrew's BBQ. we ordered the pulled pork sandwich, st. louis pork ribs, beef brisket, and the green chili mac and cheese. the ribs were the highlight, falling easily off the bone and packing a rich, smoky flavor that was complemented perfectly by their spicy BBQ sauce. the mac and cheese was also surprisingly good, despite appearing as if it came out of a box (it didn't, trust me). the pulled pork and beef brisket were a little lackluster, missing some of the saucy, juicy flavor i was expected, but they weren't bad. andrew's is the perfect alternative to little miss BBQ when you don't want to wait 1-2 hours in a line for only slightly better taste."}
{"text":"I used to travel halfway across the valley to go to Joe's BBQ in Gilbert; now, I have a new favorite destination for loaded bakers.  This place is wonderful - fast service, friendly people, and AMAZING food (to be fair, I have only tried the brisket, loaded baker, pulled pork sandwich, macaroni & cheese and cornbread. I am sure there is much more to taste).  We need more go-to family restaurants like this in the neighborhood. Also, their BBQ sauce is delicious. I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about."}
{"text":"Every time I am in the Phoenix area, I make my way here. The food is awesome! I have never been disappointed! The only operate during the week and during the day so make sure you check the time before going but believe me you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I don't know why we waited so long to try this, since it's quite close to our home, but I was finally lured by the smell of BBQ wafting through the air as I made a grocery run to Albertson's.  We ditched our planned cooking itinerary and opted for some BBQ.  I'm so glad we did.  Thick tender meaty ribs, piled high pulled pork sandwiches, and spicy cowboy beans. Oh yes, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing and fresh!' The employees are super friendly and remember us every time we go in. I always feel appreciated!! Highly recommend to everyone! Their catering is also awesome! Great food at a great cost!"}
{"text":"This little place is in a strip mall on the Northwest corner of Rural and Guadalupe in Southern Tempe.  For a good BBQ joint it is very clean and bright inside with plenty of quite nice tables and chairs.  You order at the counter, but check out the carving window first and see what looks good.  There was a beautiful pork butt right out of the smoker when I came in for lunch.  Couldn't pass up a pulled pork sandwich.  They sell the Q by the portion so I ordered a 1/2 pound which was plenty and very tasty.  There are three house BBQ sauces:  Andrew's Standard BBQ, Carolina Mustard, and Andrew's Hot and Spicy.  All were very good.  They have specials every day and today's was St. Louis style ribs which also looked great.  I want to check back on a Tuesday for the Green Chile Pork as I would love to try BBQ with a New Mexico twist."}
{"text":"I love BBQ and Andrews doesn't disappoint! So tasty, good prices, and awesome
Specials. Try the green chili Mac and cheese and fried pickles!!! Cheap beer and sliders from 3-6pm. Clean, sports on TV, and delicious BBQ. Yum!"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch on a Monday. Very good brisket would come here again just for that. Only reason I giving this place 4 stars I was looking forward to ribs they only sell them on Thursdays. The Mac and green chili was good. Hot links were ok but they cut it into pieces."}
{"text":"Handwritten menu on a humungous chalkboard. Handmade decorations with a friendly staff. Parking right at the door. 
Now the food (and the point of this update). Prior visits had a couple of disappointments (such as only offering beef brisket once a week without it being smothered in sauce and the inclusion of a large amount of fat cap on to-go brisket orders). We have made several visits recently with better results. Only a small amount of fat is left on the brisket and they now offer thick sliced brisket without sauce all of the time. If you are getting it to-go it is only $10.95/pound (far less than many other BBQ places and about the same as buying the lame sliced pressed meats at the grocery deli). 
The meat has just a slightly smokey, sweet taste and a little goes a long ways (a pound makes 6 meaty sandwiches) and is excellent cold. We haven't ordered any sides recently, but looking at other patron's plates, they look very good. This is now our preferred BBQ place."}
{"text":"It's a decent BBQ joint. I ordered what they stated as their best seller, their pulled pork sandwich. It has a normal BBQ taste nothing special, nothing bad. The pork seemed as if it was squished together. traditional pulled pork meat u can see nice strands of pork soaking up the BBQ. I also ordered their hot link appetizer. That's not that great in my opinion. I prefer Rudys a few miles away. But if ur in the area it's worth a try. No frills BBQ."}
{"text":"Decent spot for BBQ, but fails to impress overall.

Came for lunch on a Friday at 1:30pm; no crowd, big screens, cool BBQ grills hanging upside for lighting.

Saw a ton of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce boxes in the kitchen.  I can only assume that this is their sauce, or maybe they doctored it up a bit.. Either way, it's so easy to make a solid home made BBQ sauce, so why not do it right?  

The guy who served us was cool and he gave the kids a free cookie for waiting a little longer for their food.  But, overall I was disappointed because my meat was not hot.  I could tell is was reheated.  The sauce was just ok and the spicy wasn't hot enough for my liking.

Overall, It was ok but I'm not rushing back.  Gotta have fresh hot meat and handmade sauce to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Flies, Flies, Everywhere!! Something had to be decomposing somewhere in this establishment. My husband was in such a hurry to get the hell out of here; that he got snappy with me to finish my beer. As it being our first time here; we were floored to see yelp reviews saying how good it was. Forget the flies- BBQ doesn't exist here. I'm pretty sure the brisket is reheated leftovers as it was extremely dry. They put tons of sauce on it to hide the dryness which leads to a soggy bun. Probably why the plastic fork and knife is conveniently  located in the basket. The salad had some rot to it that I had to pick out and the tea tasted old. I'm sorry, but paying $30 for two lunch entrees and two beers is robbery. We will certainly never return. Only pros here would be the friendly cashier and they had the World Cup televised."}
{"text":"I followed the Yelp reviews and it took me to Andrew's.  The man at the register, who turned out to be Andrew, guided me through the extensive menu, pointing me towards something that gave me samples of pulled pork and of brisket.  I enjoyed the friendly relaxed atmosphere.  Here's a man who clearly enjoys the world of bbq, and makes a living at it!  The beef and brisket were both excellent, and cole slaw too.  I am visiting in the area, but I will definitely return."}
{"text":"really good BBQ!!! This place is a hidden gem :-)  The portions are SUPER large so it's a good idea to split.  The dining area isn't anything special so we always get carry-out."}
{"text":"I hate three star reviews.  It's critic purgatory as you can't be hyperbolic in an extreme.  I have one word for Drew's barbecue, average. 

Taste buds are a medium that can take you to dazzling places only when accompanied by a food of high caliber. Not with Andrew's.  It's tragic because although the meat was tender, the sauce was just plain Jane.   Not having a good sauce with perfectly tender meat is like having a Porsche without wheels-- sure you have a Porsche but how can you possibly enjoy it?  Andrew's simply didn't get my RPM's going.

I however will give the place it's due diligence, they have great prices and a friendly staff but that's the extent of it."}
{"text":"I found this place off of yelp and I'm really glad that I did.  The meat was amazing; the ribs were my favorite.  The woman behind the counter and was incredibly friendly and very helpful!  While we were dining we were able to see them loading up the huge smoker in the back with tons of meat.  It was pretty neat to be able to see it.  Overall the experience was really enjoyable and I'll definatly be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and HUGE portions.  It's not a huge place, they could probably seat 40 people in the dining area, but they would be 40 happy people at the end of dinner. I ate for two days off of a single dinner portion. The service was great, the wait staff friendly and the BBQ awesome.  Their spicy BBQ has a nice bite to it and is not overfilled with pepper. Their regular BBQ has a nice sweet/savory mixture of flavors that does NOT make you think that you are eating a bottle of honey (like so many other BBQ recipes do).  They also have a kick-butt green chili mac-n-cheese. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My wife and I are of the BBQ loving variety, and we're also the kind that believes it's difficult to do EVERYTHING well. Every place has it's strengths and weaknesses.

First, the strengths:
- Green Chile Mac is very, very good. We both liked it, and it's gotta a little kick, and a GREAT flavor. Love it!
- Baked potato salad: I need a carton of this in my fridge at all times. My wife is a potato salad snob, and she loves this stuff, as do I. It's nothing short of amazing..possibly the best I've ever tried from a restaurant.
- Ribs--tangy and good! We've done ribs before, and they're not easy, but these are super yummy! Not too dry, and very good flavor!
- The \"Original\" BBQ sauce is on the sweet side and is very good, and the spicy sauce is also great! I'd love to do a BBQ with either of these!

The weaknesses:
- Coleslaw. Ouch. I think Raising Cain's has better slaw...cold and crisp but very little flavor.
- Chicken. Oh this one hurt. I think I've made better BBQ chicken...it just didn't have much flavor!

The Average: 
- Brisket. It's ok. Mine was moist and juicy, but the flavor didn't knock my socks off. Given that we paid $30 for the both of us, I was really hoping it would blow me away.
It's not that it was bad! It's just... well, I'd rather have Rudy's Brisket. I also felt like half of my 1/2 pound sandwich was fat...and brisket is a pretty fatty cut so that's not completely unexpected.
- Pulled pork. The pulled pork WAS better than the brisket but still not much to write home about.

We both felt like the strength of the BBQ sauce was there to cover up the meat... and that's kind of a backwards way to do it. But everyone has they're own style. For us, I think we'll say we tried it and move on. The service was good and the place has a nice little feel. But overall for the money I think there's more flavor elsewhere. I'd rather give this 2.5 stars than 2, but the weak mainstay, the BBQ, is hard to overlook. I will say this place has their sides DIALED IN. Can't beat that potato salad and chile mac! Yummy! But it might be time to reevaluate that BBQ technique a tad."}
{"text":"The ribs were tender and tasty, the potato salad was a surprising treat- sour cream instead of mayo!- the decor is open and bright, and our server, Dana, was a delight.  The location (next to a grocery store, blending into a corner) belies how stand-out the restaurant is.  If you're in the area, keep your eyes peeled and give this joint a shot!"}
{"text":"So, I am cheating right now. I actually tried this place via catering one day-- so I have no clue what their business looks like, whether or not they've cleaned their tables properly or if it smells funny. The only thing dirty is how good their pulled pork, pulled chicken, potato salad and beans are... 

The meat is so melt-in-your-mouth tender that I actually had to remind myself to put the sauce on. Also, the sauce is tangy, spicy, AND user-friendly (gluten-free) so everyone can enjoy! Their side dishes compliment the meat-the beans are just a little smokey, and the potato salad has just enough mustard in it, to give it all an enthusiastic thumbs up. I can't wait to actually visit and try out their other items..."}
{"text":"My boy and I , love stopping for a bite to eat at Andrews, we stove to make it there on Thursday. Because their special on that day is Ribs , now those are some amazing ribs, the brisket is also the BEST I have ever had ! The staff is amazing Jodi is always on point , the pit master is awesome he has our order ready in like it seems 2 sec. keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Andrew's was ok at best. The BBQ sauce they put on everything is lacking to say the least. I got the sampler and I didn't enjoy anything too much. My girlfriend said the Mac and cheese was good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places, if not my favorite. We have tried other BBQ places and none have been what Andrew's is. The best pulled pork anywhere! Their sides are fantastic like their green chili mac and cheese and the garlic mashed potatoes. I have never been a cornbread fan, but their cornbread is so tasty and never dry. The service is always good. It is very hard to dislike this place."}
{"text":"Glad to finally try this place.  The aroma of barbecue will make your mouth water if you're hungry.  The prices made me wonder why we hadn't come here sooner.
Great combos and options that offer a sampling of more than one item on their menu.
And did I mention cornbread?!
Or for those that live dangerously, fried pickles.
I got the slider combo of beef, pork, and chicken and it came with one side.  I opted for corn bread.
Good stuff and big portions too.  I couldn't eat more than one slider.  My son let me taste his green chile mac and cheese.  Yummy stuff but the mac and cheese reminded me of KFCs mac and cheese -kinda processed tasting.
Overall the food was tasty, selection good, and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Love their ribs!  Love the green chile mac & cheese, Love the mashed potatoes, love the corn bread.  I can't explain the flavors without going out to get some, so I will stop here.

it's great they're down the street on any craving moment I have!

They cater, so great for parties! Most of the times I've been there it's empty but then you see people walk in and out, so they do a lot of to go orders.  Don't be fooled by the lack of sit in customers."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new BBQ joint for a while now and I spotted Andrews BBQ I entered the restaurant really clean and friendly staff. I ordered the BBQ sandwich includes 1 side dish. Slider Trio (pork/beef/chicken) Green chile macaroni and cheese. The Andrews spicy BBQ and the regular BBQ sauce were really good. Really good BBQ great prices will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef brisket.it was fine.not spectacular. I could taste the smoke in the meat but it had a lighter fluid like taste.ive encountered this before. Must be how they start the smoker.the meat was not tough,but also took a knife to cut.i also tried the pulled pork.it was good.a little dry.nothing spectacular. Their were 3 sauces to choose from.the mustard was too tart but I'm not into mustard sauces so you make the call.the original was like a bottle of vinegar. The one I chose to use was the hot bbq.it wasn't bad.not too spicy either.once again,born in spectacular. The employee's were nice,but when she saw me pouring out my iced tea( sitting there too long taste..or need to clean the brewer) she asked if it was not good.i told her it wasn't. But she never changed it. Didn't seem to care and didn't offer to refund the purchase of my drink. No big deal,but still I took notice..the corn bread was dry not warmed up and not very good. All of this considered,I don't think you will leave here upset, but definitely nothing to come back for. 3 stars."}
{"text":"Today I hit up Andrews BBQ for the brisket.  Disappointed again!  The brisket was properly cooked, decent flavor, but was appeared dry and tasted dry.  The cornbread was excellent, but served cold. Hot would have earned another star, in spite of the dry brisket.  The Green Chile Mac was tasty, but had sat so long it was mushy.  For the 25 I spent for two lunch specials, I walked away feeling like I did not get my money's worth.  I'll try it again in a pinch, but still consider Rudy's to be the top spot in the East Valley, with Famous Dave's coming in at number two.

This is my fourth attempt at Andrews."}
{"text":"1 word awesome. I ordered the Q Sampler and got so much food I ate about 3 meals. The portions are good and the taste is excellent. Dana our server was great also; Good attitude, funny personality and overall excellent service."}
{"text":"So this is a tale of two experiences. The first time spent at Andrew's was great. Pulled pork and wings were good, and with a local Hop Knot to wash it down, I knew I would be back. 

Fast forward to today's experience. I cruised in pretty dang hungry and went with the half chicken and 1/3 ribs. The meal came with a side (green chile mac) and corn bread. There I sat, awaiting my delicious ribs and chicken, hungry as all-get-out, when a boneless, skinless \"half chicken\" was placed in front of me. OH THE HORROR!!!! WTF!?!?!? Boneless and skinless \"pieces\" of chicken? Fresh out of the steamer? Not only was this gross, but this is positively shameful in the world of BBQ. The chicken had absolutely no flavor (surprise, surprise) but neither did the ribs! I'm all for BBQ sauce, but the meat should stand on it's own merit. Slather as much BBQ on there as you want, but the meat's gotta be good to begin with. The chicken was inedible without a healthy helping of BBQ and the flavorless ribs weren't much better. 

Onto the rest: Green chile mac basically looked and tasted like Stouffer's 'orange box' with some green chile's in it, didn't bother with the cornbread at all, and the \"hot\" BBQ sauce was anything but hot. A different flavor than the other sauce, but definitely not hot. 

My Hop knot was, however, quite delicious. 

ALL FOR $18.95?!?!?!!?!?!?!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

Take note Yelpers: This place is a perfect example of why you need to eat at a joint more than once before you can offer a comprehensive review and now I know unequivocally, that I will not be back."}
{"text":"After recently re-locating to the Southwest. I have been searching hard for a solid BBQ place that will fill the temporary void for the places I love in Texas, Kansas City, St. Louis... etc. I am still searching hard for that place. Andrew's did have really friendly service, the sides such as Green Chile Mac N' Cheese did taste good as everyone has said. However for me the true test of a BBQ joint is the Brisket. Does it have a good smoke ring? Is it sliced, is it chopped? Is it perfectly charred on the outside? Is it drowned in sauce or do they allow the taste of the meat to speak for itself? Obviously, in fairness many of these things differ regionally. I do feel I have a good opinion of what amazing BBQ should taste like. This brisket was drowned in sauce, there was very little smoke ring or smoky flavor at all. It was simply just not my thing. Now, for a couple of good notes, My finace' got the pulled smoked chicken, (I personally never order chicken at BBQ joints as I feel to me BBQ begins with brisket and ribs)... but in this case the Chicken triumphed and was really freaking good! I ended up ditching my brisket and sharing the pulled chicken with her. Whatever was lacking in smokiness in my brisket was made up for whole heartedly in the chicken. It had a wonderful, very bold smoky flavor. I would definitely go back and order it again. The BBQ sauce was very sweet. The hot and mild to me tasted a bit too similar, I wish the hot had a bit more kick but overall the sauce here is pretty damn tasty. So yes, my quest for the perfect \"Q\" in Arizona still lingers on however if I want great pulled chicken and friendly service Andrew's will be on the top of my list."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have had since moving to AZ from Texas. However, that is not saying much. They do have a great menu with a lot of options and so I was pleasantly surprised by that. They even offer some basics like burgers and tacos if there is someone in your party that is not a barbecue lover.  Also, even though the place was casual it still had some cool decor like the grill lights on the ceiling and was both clean and comfortable. 

The spicy bbq sauce was pretty good and reminded me a little of some of the great BBQ places in Texas. I also liked the green chili mac and cheese but I don't think it was as amazing as some of the reviewers claim. Not cheesy enough. I also had the fried okra which was delicious - best I have had outside of Louisiana. The corn bread was decent but nothing special. 

I will definitely be back but I am still hunting for someplace in the valley that has beef ribs.  Pig meat just does not compare!"}
{"text":"I stepped into this restaurant, caught a whiff of the smokey bbq and knew I was in the right place! The restaurant itself is fairly spacious, and the menu board is easy to read on the chalkboard. There is quite a lot to choose from, with various appetizers, sandwiches, sides, and smoked meats available.

I opted for the pulled pork sandwich with green chile mac and cheese ($7.95). The sandwich was filled with a heaping pile of tender, smokey pulled pork, with a hearty portion of mac and cheese on the side. You have your choice of regular or hot bbq sauce. The \"hot\" bbq sauce, while enjoyable for its nice balance of sweet and tangy, didn't taste very spicy to me (More like a mild level of spiciness). The mac and cheese was decent. I could definitely taste the green chile mixed in with the cheese.

Service was lightning fast and very friendly. Overall, a good experience. Someday I'll step in here to share a sampler platter!"}
{"text":"I feel like it's always hit or miss. When it's good it's good but when it's bad it's bad. I come here once or twice a month. I enjoy the fries but they overload them with way to much salt, and tonight I can tell they haven't changed out the oil in awhile because the fries tastes like catfish. Next time I eat here I hope I can give a 5 star review."}
{"text":"OK, so knowing I was coming to Tempe for a few days, I posted in Tempe Talk to find a decent place to have some food.  This was recommended by a local... Good call.  I am Yelping it on my way down from Vegas, says they are opened on Sunday... they aren't.  I added a tip for those of you who don't read this much.

I ended up eating here on my second night in town.  I enter at 5:15pm, I am the only one here.  The girl behind the counter is incredibly friendly and helpful, the chef/cook, made eye contact, smiled, started working on my meal as soon as I ordered.  That impressed me.

My food arrived in break-neck speed.  I ordered the BBQ Sampler (picture submitted) and everything looked good.  Pulled Pork, Shredded Chicken, and Brisket all came in separate Styrofoam cups, cut of Corn Bread, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Cole Slaw, and 2 Beef Ribs... $14.95.  WOW!  This is a meal for 3!

Starting with the least flavorful, the Chicken was kinda bland.  I wasn't overly impressed, it was relatively tender, a touch on the dry side though... it relied on the BBQ sauce.

Pulled Pork - This was pretty legitimate.  Good flavor, tender, still a touch on the dry side.  I would eat it again, but not incredibly confident in it's stand alone ability.  

Brisket - Nice!  Tender, juicy, good flavor.  The BBQ sauce complimented it, not made it.  This was a good cut of meat, clearly slow smoked.  I am a fan.  I would highly recommend the Brisket if you are eating here!

The sides-  Slaw- a Vinegar based, good flavor, slight kick, but I enjoyed it.  The Garlic Mashed Potatoes- Great flavor.  Chives added on top, clearly home made. I really enjoyed these!  The Corn Bread- Great flavor, not a boxed taste... Had some integrity to it.  Would order it again.

All in all, this is a good BBQ joint.  I read a review before I entered that ripped this place and my thoughts are the guy has an axe to grind personally.  It was not my experience that his thoughts reflected the food I ate.  I will certainly be back, would recommend a friend to visit.

There is a fair amount of dog decorations too... Kinda cool.  Adds.. a certain friendliness.  From the bronze statue under the specials menu when you walk in to the board of (I would assume) customer dogs... Really kinda cool.  Neat place!"}
{"text":"Love home smoked, quality BBQ? Tired of chain joints that cost too much for gimmicky food? Andrew's will blow you away in a smokey cloud.

Nothing fancy: the way barbeque was meant to be served. You go up and order at a counter in front of an massive open kitchen where you can see their smokehouse and talk to the pit masters as they work. You sit down at simple wooden tables with a roll of paper towels in the center and your choice of home-made BBQ sauces. You get served in baskets or trays covered in checked picnic paper. You eat with businessmen and doctors shoulder to shoulder with landscapers and the smelly and bearded. Everyone (besides those damn vegatarians) love Andrew's. And why not? Grade-A Kansas City Q being served up without any frills and bullsh*t. Just what the valley needed.

The fact that you're still reading this review means you've waited too long to go. You owe it to yourself to put the best BBQ in AZ in your mouth. Get in your car and go. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I've always liked Andrew's BBQ, and ever since they closed down the one near me a while back, I've quietly missed them.  Last night I finally made it to this location and it was awesome!

I liked how this one's decorated.  They have upside down BBQ grills hanging from the ceiling as light fixtures, plenty of tables and other decor that really seemed cute.  I swear the menu was bigger then I remember!  The girl at the register was really nice and helpful, and took our orders after answering all of our questions.

I went with my usual, BBQ beef brisket with garlic mashed potatos as my side.  My friend went with the bbq chicken sandwich with the mac and cheese.  Both were tasty, and we had a really good time.

Love Andrew's, and will be back when I get a chance!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  I never knew this place was here and one day we stopped here for lunch.  If you happen to catch it when its open they have A-MAZING mack and cheese and the best french fries i have ever had.  The small order is HUGE and I dont really need to say anything about the meat because .. I mean.. how often do you go to a bbq place and the sides are better than the meat?  Never....   I will be coming back.. My mouth is watering just thinking about this place again."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST BBQ joint in Arizona hands down. Forget Tom's forget Rudy's and forget everything else. This is it! Just try it and I swear you will be addicted. I took a pic of my favorite meal here, the green chili pork tacos with a side of green chili mac n' cheese!"}
{"text":"Ever since we first tried Andrew's, we've tried to go back a few times a month. It's easily the best BBQ in Tempe, and better than all but one other place I've been to in the Valley. And even that's close. Don't be fooled by the look of the place. For the longest time I didn't know if it was a resturant or if they sold grills or what. It definately doesn't look like a good ol' boy's bbq joint, but the meat is what matters and they definately deliver. 

The pulled pork is definately my #1, but I like to get the slider trio (generally 1 chicken, 1 pork and 1 brisket slider) with 2 pulled pork sliders and 1 beef brisket. Their fries are nice and crispy without being too crispy and the rest of their sides are good too. Their spicy BBQ sauce is served in a convenient shooter to easily load onto every bite. Innovation at it's finest. Plus they have diet dr. pepper on the fountain. Have to like that."}
{"text":"The prices are awesome and the food exceeded my expectation full fold! I'm from near Texas and hard to please with barbecue selection, will be visiting here often. :)"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I have been looking for that off the beaten path/hole in the wall bbq joint. And we've found that with Andrews. The customer service was beyond amazing thanks to DANA :) 
The food was so mouth watering it wasn't even funny. The green chile mac and cheese.... there isn't even words to describe it. The ribs were great with the dry rub and some sauce squirted on as you eat. The chicken wings were just kickin'. 
I'd recommend this to my neighbor, my mother, my friends... oh wait I already have. 
If you're looking for a great place for a great meal whether eat in or carry out, choose Andrews!
Oh and the cornbread. It tastes like cake........... it just melts in your mouth.
Go now, before it's too late!!"}
{"text":"Green chili mac-decent. Chili's not completely skinned. 

Sauces-
Hot-Not hot! At all!
Original-pretty standard, but tasty.
Carolina mustard-good. Could use some more vinegar bite, less sweet.

Brisket - Smoke ring barely noticeable.
Fairly moist, smoke taste faint....very faint.
Crust-Good flavor. A touch salty.
Overall- definitely could use more smoke. Don't rush it. A touch less salt in the rub....all personal preferences of course...except for the smoke flavor. The smoke ring, or lack thereof speaks for itself. It's been rushed.


Served typical with cheap hamburger bun.
Served fat on (moist). Not too thick, good flavor, except for the salt content in the rub.

Ambiance - fairly clean, not cluttered. Trash and dust visible under soda serving station. Mix of music.
Service-pretty fast. Very friendly! Service was fantastic.

$20.00 lunch
1/2 lb with a side, and drink.
Fairly overpriced for the quality. But, pretty spot on for the area.
Appears to rely on catering service.  Limited walk ins during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Yelp steered me here, and it sure didn't steer me wrong! I had the three sliders (2 pork, 1 brisket). The pulled pork, green chile mac and cheese, and hot barbecue sauce were all phenomenal, and the portions were large. I stole a rib off of another plate, which was also quite tasty. For about $10, I got a delicious meal I couldn't quite finish off, despite having not eaten all day -- a hard combination to beat!"}
{"text":"Very very good pulled pork sandwich. I pretty much order pulled pork whenever I go to a bbq place. This place blew my socks off! Meat was full of flavor, tender and didn't have big hunks of fat that ruin many other places pork sandwichs. The bun was soft and delicious and don't even get me started on the spicy bbq sauce.... (drooling). This and Waldo's in Mesa are my two favorite places to eat bbq. Lucille's and Famous Dave... meh..."}
{"text":"BBQ is good - service was so slow. They cater to big groups. So if you show up during that - your order is after that one. Poor timing : 
I won't be coming back ."}
{"text":"Location & Aesthetics - Located in Tempe off E Guadalupe Road next to Albertsons on the end in the corner of the strip mall.
Lots of available parking.  The restaurant was clean including the bathroom facilities.  The place was well lit though a bit on the cold side from the air conditioning.  
The tables were clean as well.

Menu - Clearly visible above the checkout on a large blackboard written in chalk and pretty much self-explanatory.  

Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  They answered any questions we had regarding the menu.  
The place was surprisingly empty for dinnertime on a Saturday.  When we arrived there was only one patron eating and another who came in to pick up his order.  After washing up, I came out and discovered we were the only ones there for the entire time and we spent about 45-60 minutes there.
No servers but the guy who took our orders at checkout brought out our food to the table.

Food - I had pork ribs with a side of BBQ beans and plate came also with a side of cornbread.  I have to say I really wasn't that much impressed with either the sides or the pork ribs.
The pork ribs should be tasted enough on its own without having to douse with some of Andrew Original BBQ sauce which was by the way very tasty.
The BBQ baked beans wasn't quite seasoned enough or provided that kick I was looking for.  The pork ribs wasn't hot and didn't feel as if it just came out of the smoker but cooked much earlier in the day (remember, we were there around 1700-1800 for dinner), and the meat didn't really slide off the bone as I expected.  It wasn't juicy, tender or soft.
The cornbread was too moist and wasn't tasty but had a rather bland taste to it.  (-3 on ribs, and two sides)

Can't say I'll be back...."}
{"text":"This is by far some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Every time I visit my Parents in Arizona I have to stop by at least 2 times. This place is so good that I've actually had it packed in dry ice and shipped next day to my house in Florida when I got a craving. You owe it to yourself to stop in the next time you have a craving for some amazing BBQ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got the BBQ sampler and were very pleased with all of the items.  The meats were overall very tender (I prefer ribs that are a tad bit more tender), and the BBQ sauces were finger-licking good, although the spicy version was not spicy.  I can't bring myself to give that fifth star though because we found the jalapeno mac and cheese to be very bland and mushy.  We may have extraordinarily high expectations, however, judging by the mostly favorable reviews on the mac and cheese from other reviewers.  I definitely think that this is a restaurant worth going to if you are in the mood for BBQ!  But take it to go, because the ambiance of this restaurant doesn't quite stand up to the quality of its food."}
{"text":"I could be wrong, but I don't really get the impression that Arizona folks know or care about serious BBQ.  That said, I've had good 'cue in other parts of the country, so I guess I should consider myself lucky that there's a place as good as Andrew's in my backyard.  From the outside, I could smell the smoke, which I can't say that I've experienced at any other BBQ spot in the valley.  One star just for that.

I've been here a few times and always get something different.  They have daily specials all the time and are usually a good deal.  Their menu is pretty extensive, the prices are reasonable, and I've never had a bad meal here.  But this place is always DEAD.  It's a shame - maybe people are more budget-conscious, or they aren't aware of this place (see first paragraph) - I just hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"Got the BBQ sampler, the BBQ beans, mashed potatoes and corn bread to split between two people. Everything was really good and a lot of food. Ended up taking about half of it home.Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There sure was a lot of hype about this place over the past few weeks.  I finally gave in and drove out to see it for myself.  I was a little under-impressed with the inside but no bother.  I ordered one of my favorite BBQ dishes of all time - the loaded baked potato.  This one had pork which is really the only appropriate topping. 

As far as the bbq goes, it was wicked good.  Some of the best bbq pork I've had from a local joint in AZ.  The potato, on the other had, was over heated to a fault.  Way too hard.  It wasn't so bad that it ruined the meal but it sure was a shame to screw up such good bbq with such a rock hard potato.

I might go back.  There are so many more bbq places to try.  There wasn't anything on the menu that made me want to come back.  It was really good though and, if I was over there (or their other location) it's probably the best bbq in that part of town."}
{"text":"I love good barbecue! I have to make my own barbecue but it's still fun to go out and try a barbecue restaurant now and then. The most Important thing about barbecue is using hardwood to actually smoke the meet. Some places don't seem to know this concept and their meat has no smoke flavor at all. Not so here! As soon as you walk in the restaurant you can smell smoky goodness.

I was recently in Houston and got to try some barbecue there and wanted to see how it compared to this place. I order the same thing I had in Houston which was a brisket and pulled pork.The brisket had a good bark to it and did not have a lot of fat in it like the one in Houston did. It was a tad dry but their wonderful barbecue sauce took care of that.  My favorite was their original barbecue sauce with green Tabasco mixed in.  

I also ordered a side of coleslaw which was also pretty good. They also threw in some cold hamburger buns to go with the barbecue. Maybe they could try toasting it or how about Texas toast? You could tell it just came out of the refrigerator because of how cold it was.  No bother as I don't eat bread very often anyway. I ordered three quarters of a pound of each so I did not leave hungry.

If you like good barbecue and you are in the area I recommend stopping by this place."}
{"text":"The St. Louis Style ribs was delicious, although I only had a bite because it wasn't my dish! Haha. I had the green chili pulled pork, this dish was not as I expected. The pulled pork was soupy like with store bought tortillas, red salsa that looked like pace brand and shredded cheese. Supposedly it was suppose to mimic street tacos ? I also tried the green chili macaroni- I'm not a fan. Tasted like Valveeta cheese mixed with green chili, I was disappointed because I got the impression of homemade. If that green chili Mac was homemade- I would have not even cared about salsa and cheese. The St. Louis Ribs would only thing I would recommend. A good spot for delicious BBQ MEAT."}
{"text":"i was in an abnormal mood for pulled pork so hit this place up to try and satisfy my annoying craving. 

Staff was very nice, Cool pictures and two tv's as well. Not a place to really hang out for hours on end or anything. beer selection is very minimal as well. We ordered a lot of food. pulled pork sandwich, a sampler and also the hotlink with mustard appetizer. baled potato salad, mac n cheese cornbread etc.

Everything was good. Don't really have any complaints. I have not ventured to many BBQ places in the area so i cant really compare, so for now they get an A-OK until i venture off and have someone to compare them too.."}
{"text":"One STAR! (I ate the salad and two ribs) I drove 5-6 miles because of the good reviews.  Scary that people think that's good bbq. 
I got their sampler and was happy to see the portions were fair size.
Ribs were ok at best.  Everything was bland, even the ranch dressing and \"hot\" bbq sauce.
The other meats were gross. I tasted each and put the lids back on the containers, they were literally that bad.
 I'm going to take the brisket, chicken and pork back tomorrow.

I'll update my review tomorrow to see how they handle customer complaints."}
{"text":"Just recently found this place at the now closed Mesa Location... Kind of a rough part of Mesa for sure and there were two bums hanging out near the entrance. Hmmm.... 

When I walked in I was pleased with the decor of 70's Record Album covers of various artists and the music playing. 

When I saw the kitchen equipment I got a little worried since it looked a bit unkempt. I found out later that they truck everything in from their Guadalupe store. 

The food: 

Pork - Great 
Beef - Good 
Chicken - Good 
Ribs - Sucked. Full of fat, and were tough St. Louis style instead of Baby 
Backs. 
Beans - A little heavy on the molasses, but pretty good nonetheless 
Slaw - Great. 

Two style of sauce, regular and hot. Meh..."}
{"text":"It's pretty good... I really liked the brisket.  I am still in search of the perfect BBQ place here in the Phoenix area.  The service by the way was killer so I would recommend it.  BTW check out the cool light fixtures when you are in there."}
{"text":"Pretty good meat he has. I stumbled on this turning around in the parking lot and was hungry so I stopped by to get some pulled pork. Didn't even need BBQ sauce as the meat was nice and tender with plenty of smokey flavor. I got an order of BBQ beans for the side and they were nice and smokey and full of flavor as well. This is a nice hidden gem and better than a handful of other joints I would frequent. This is on the top of my list for some quick, inexpensive go-to BBQ."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem for sure!

Was craving for some BBQ in PHX and Little Miss was too packed, Rhema Soul was too far.. Andrews BBQ was the perfect answer!

Ordered the brisket and Ribs and boy! The ribs were on par with some of best in the Midwest!

Sucks that they're only open 10a-2p but man! It's a definite must try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because we were in the area and love bbq. It was an off meal time (3pm) and dead but service was fast and good. 

Ordered the Q Sampler to share and so glad we did. Was enough for 4 people and ended up wasting a lot but the prices were great. Flavors were good but the meat was over chopped and fatty for all 3 (chicken, pork and beef). Sides were nothing special but not bad either. Wish the cornbread had more flavor but the BBQ sauces were tasty. 

Don't live here but not sure if we would come back any way."}
{"text":"Simple: this is a solid place to get BBQ, I like the brisket, pork and ribs.  The cowboy and baked beans are both solid sides too.

I can't give them 5 as I really prefer that heavy smoked flavor, but their hot BBQ sauce is just the right amount of spicy so it can be easily added.

Note that they do a lot of catering.  Next time you need BBQ for a party, now you know where to get it."}
{"text":"Good barbecue place near Tempe. . Love stopping and getting a BBQ pulled pork sandwich

{"text":"This is a great place for BBQ. Ribs, sandwiches, everything there is delicious. They have several different types of BBQ sauce which is always a bonus. Service is friendly and fast, and the atmosphere laid back. The mac and cheese with green chile is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I love the loaded fries!! Soo good! Every component is perfect! Also perfectly brewed iced tea."}
{"text":"Really good smoke flavor not overwhelming, nice bark on the ribs. I'm not a fan of spareribs but the flavor was there the tenderness was there.  Overall I would say A+. Brisket was a little dry but not too bad"}
{"text":"I have been really hesitant to start visiting BBQ joints because of a lot of recent strikeouts.  I've always been so disappointed to maintain that my favorite BBQ place is Famous Daves (Boo Chains!)  I finally gave in and decided to give Andrew's BBQ a shot.  

Walking into the shop, we were pretty confused.  There was a giant space in the wall that lead to the kitchen and then a large open area with tables, a pass through window and a cooler on the side.  We weren't sure if we sat down and waited for someone to help us or where we supposed to order.  Thankfully a girl came out and was extremely friendly and helpful.  I want to say her name was Dana or something very close to that.  I ended up ordering the 1/2lb chicken plate which came with a piece of jalapeno cornbread and a side, I picked coleslaw.

The food didn't take very long to come out and it looked wonderful.  I'm pretty sure the cook was feeling generous because I got wayyyy more chicken than I ordered, but I'm not complaining.  It was lunch for two more days.  The first thing I tried was the coleslaw and it was refreshingly different.  It was tangy and slightly sweet with some herbs I'm not quite sure of.  My best guess is dill.  The chicken was quite good, but a tiny bit dry.  It still retained all of its great flavor and was only made better by the AMAZING bbq sauce.  I have been on a search for the greatest bbq sauce, and this is definitely a contender.  It's thick and rich, kind of sweet, a little bit spicy, a little smokey, but a whole lot of flavor.  I really loved it!  I think they sell it, and I may have to purchase some.

Overall, I was really pleased with Andrew's BBQ, but I would like to come back and try their brisket and maybe another side before I determine where they fit on my scale of barbecue greatness."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. The brisket falls off the bone. Excellent customer service.!!! This is my first time coming here and the cashier was very patient with us. She went over the menu, all the choices and options. She even gave us her recommendation. Kitchen looks clean. When we were done, she even came over and asked if she could take some things away. My friends and I were chilling there after dinner. They give you your space and did not make you feel rush to leave at all. There was only one person in the kitchen and the lady/cook were helping each other out. It was comforting to see teamworks. I will certainly come back here again!"}
