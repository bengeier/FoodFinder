{"text":"This place is insanely over priced. The co-0p is only 15 minutes away from here and is more reasonable and has nicer people... the woman in the bakery who seemed to be in charge! Was rude and not welcoming. While my sister ordered a $9+tax smoothie I had to wonder around the store because I couldn't handle this woman's attitude. The smoothie was made with a green banana that was not frozen... the key ingredient to smoothies is ripened, frozen bananas. And they Are NOT ORGANIC!!!! The co-0p makes smoothies and juices all organic for a much better price.. much better selection and quality.. I would not recommend this place or ever go back there.."}
{"text":"Ali's marketplace is literally an oasis of gluten free goodness in a world where cross contamination is an ever present point of anxiety.  I love that for once I can go into a market and feel like a normal person.  Literally everything is gluten free... so, though i still do, you don't even have to check the labels *cue gasping and fainting.*   The staff is super nice, helpful and patient ( especially when you get overwhelmed at the bakery counter on your first or second trip to the marketplace). I usually stop here for lunch on saturdays when I am free to get the Chipotle chicken sandwich.  The bread has a wonderful texture and is very soft while having adequate crunch.  The chipotle chicken is actually a bit spicy ( and im a gal who loves her spice) and I would recommend eating it while still warm for best results.   In terms of the bakery counter... you really cant go wrong.  Their strawberry shortcake is moist, their pumpkin pie has an addictive crust, their muffins and cookies are also very pleasant.  I havent tried their smoothies yet... but I am literally just lying in wait for a spare moment so I can go back to get one.  They sound delicious.   Overall, they have a great deli/ bakery counter paired with a large selection of gluten free products.  For all my more quirky gluten free needs I go to Ali's first."}
{"text":"The baked goods at Ali's Marketplace are out of this world! You definitely won't find a better selection or better tasting gf goodies!"}
{"text":"I don't let price dictate my ratings.  I will pay a premium for a top notch item.  I got the Italian sandwich, which is supposed to be 6 inches.  It seemed a little on the small side.  There was nothing extraordinary about the sandwich.  For $12, I want to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Very sad day for this GF GIRL. Us Celiac's seek out FRIENDLY BUSINESSES that are safe to eat and this place was starting to be a great experience until the owner yelled over the counter to \"Stop taking photos\" and so I walked up to her to ask what the problem was only to get a lecture of how this is her \"blood sweat and tears and she doesn't want me taking pictures of her products and stealing her trade secrets.\" When I explained that I post reviews/photos to this site, she was still nasty and totally ruined the whole experience with her attitude. The irony is that trade secrets are not in the photo, it is the recipe. She is NOT a very nice person and seems to not exercise a good business model to verbally attack your patrons due to your fears. I was a PAYING patron, not the enemy. Side note: the sandwiches are normal size at 11.49 and up. A cupcake sized cake was 7.99 -- WOW! I will NOT BE BACK..."}
{"text":"The lunch was very good and flavorful. A little pricey.  Put the peach muffin was very delicious. Could not tell it was gluten free at all. Great job."}
{"text":"I love this little place to shop for my dairy free products like Daiya pizzas. I have not tried the baked goods yet or the deli. It is pricey but expect that with ant gluten-free dairy free foods. Also, it's in a cute little area in Murrysville."}
{"text":"Okay, I have to say I am very happy that the area has a place to get various gluten free products that aren't as readily available as in other places that I live. That being said, the prices are at least 20% plus higher than they are where I normally live and shop. For example GF bread- 5.99 or so at every major retailer where I live (grocery store, specialty grocery store, Target, etc.) at Gluten Free Zone- 8.00 plus. Rice chips on sale every other week at these same stores 2/6.00 are 5.00 plus each here. I have many other examples, and I find it extremely frustrating as I believe that the majority of people shopping here are doing so out of a medical need, and because there are so few options in the area. They are ripping people off-does it really cost that much more to have these products here? Customers of this store really need to be aware that they are paying way too much for these products. I have started ordering staples online to have on hand when I visit here; many are comparable to the prices I pay in CA; sometimes less with free shipping. Be aware, and demand better conveniences in your area!"}
