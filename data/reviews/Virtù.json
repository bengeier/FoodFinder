{"text":"We ate 3 brunches at  Virtu as included with lodging at the Bespoke. 
Bespoke is a fabulous lodging with all the amenities necessary. Those plush towels !!
Virtu is heavenly. We had the bruschetone, octopus, ultimate Benedict,steak and potato and the burger. Everything tasted like such effort was put in to create the blend of flavor that you just want for another serving. We eat out in Boston a lot, 
and we were so impressed with the offerings at Virtu. The mushroom and truffle oil on the bruschetone, the charred octopus yet tender on the inside, burger cooked to perfection with ready flavor topping. I need to get myself back to have more meals there."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to the octopus dish after reading the reviews, but my dish was a big disappointment.  The chef had charred the fish to a crisp so that it was tough and the tips inedible. The grilled cheese sandwiches were black as well. Service let us down too because our poor waitress was the only staff waiting on the entire restaurant and patio for lunch.  She tried her best, but they really needed another person during the lunch hour.  And how do they get away with charging $45 for a bottle of Prosecco?
Over-cooked and over-priced."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Virtu and to Arizona. We booked a reservation based on the many positive reviews and we were surprisingly disappointed. Here's why. 

Upon arriving the hostess was less then welcoming.  As we waited for her to clean our table we went to the bar to order a drink while we waited.   The bartenders were slow to attend to our arrival considering how small the bar is. Once we received our drinks we noticed our table was now set and the hostess was less than interested in seeing us seated so we sat ourselves. 

The dining room is small, cozy BUT it was filled with smoke with the smoke detectors blaring. A pregnant  women was fanning herself and asked for the doors to be open for fresh air. There was no apologies of any kind and no resolve.  

The menu was small in choice but creative. They are less than accommodating for any food allergy or adjustments to the menu and this is noted politely in small font at the bottom of the menu. Both my husband and I are gluten and lactose so our choices were few and far between. We both ordered the octopus for our starter and it was by far the best octopus we have tasted. The scallop dish was tasty but too salty for my tastebuds and the duck was tasty but unfulfilling. The prices for the mains were not worth it. 

Now for the wine. Their website prided themselves on their wine list but choices by the glass are minimal at best. We were sadly unimpressed. 

The saviour of the night was our server Taylor. She was extremely informative, pleasant and helpful.  

Unfortunately our next visit to Arizona will not have this restaurant on our visitation list."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  This isn't something you can cook at home, the Octopus appetizer, the short rib and the scallops all so well prepared."}
{"text":"5 stars for ambiance (including a charming patio), food, and gelato offerings (try the perfect pistachio). 4 stars for attentive but not especially warm or friendly service. Still worth the trip and many return visits. No one has to be nice to me if the food & drinks are this good. :)"}
{"text":"First time to Virtu and I came away very impressed. The menu was small, but elegant/unique. Our party of four ordered different entrees and starters, we loved everything we tried. My favorite was the duck. Probably the best I've had in the valley. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was warm and romantic."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have finally gotten around to trying out this little gem of a restaurant. All of the good reviews here are spot on! The setting is so very charming...only a handful of small tables in this special little spot. There were outdoor tables as well. The service was great; very attentive but not over-bearing.  From the second we walked in the door, it was obvious that they were happy to have us in for the evening. 

I appreciate the thoughtful approach to the menu....only a handful of items in each category. We had the octopus starter - PERFECTION on a plate....unbelievably tender, with just the right amount of char. Seriously, I should have ordered two of these (...next time I think we will!). The burrata platter was amazing...so very rich and delightful. Even the toasted/charred bread was delish! It comes with a roasted pepper, which at first I didn't see how they fit together, but turns out to work well. yum. We had a trio of the small plates: eggplant, steak tartar, croquette. The steak was our favorite. The eggplant was very good; just as the server described, it kinda has the flavors of pizza.  The croquette, while very yummy, seemed to be common. For dessert, we shared the butterscotch pudding....another perfectly executed dish! We sat at the bar, which was a treat in itself, the bartender was very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. He selected a really nice wine for me to enjoy with my dinner and I tried white port for the first time...such a nice suggestion! 

Now, after this glowing review one may ask, \"why only four stars?\". Answer: It was LOUD. I'm not talking about \"noisy\", I mean \"can't hear yourself think\" loud.  We were initially seated at a two top, but decided to move to the bar because there was no way we would be able to hear each other talk at the table (as noted above, sitting at the bar turned out to be a great thing...). Apparently they usually keep the sliding doors open which helps, but on the night we were there, they had everything closed up due to weather. This is unfortunate as there is really nothing that can be done other than opening the doors. The only other tidbit is the lighting was too bright for my taste. Seems that it would have been so much more enjoyable to have the overhead lighting dimmed a bit and maybe more candle lighting.... 

With all that said, I already have plans to return (I will go in November when the doors are open)."}
{"text":"I'm not a foodie but I have a good friend who is a foodie and he insisted that we come here because I had to try it and he was paying.  That sealed the deal for me (when you see their prices on the menu you'll understand).

As it turns out I only had an appetizer and a drink (long, uninteresting story that has nothing to do with the restaurant).  But, what an appetizer!  We don't have a lot of octopuses (is that a cool word or what?) in the desert so you get one when you have the chance.  Virtu's grilled octopus with chickpeas is served with chili butter. There's a bit of a char but they are very tender.  My foodie friend insisted that I have their Let The Beet In cocktail along with the octopus because it complemented the dish (I told you he was a foodie). I guess he's right and frankly it's not the type of drink I would have ordered on my own.  It's made with salted beet syrup (I didn't know there was such a thing) with aquavit, mezcal and lime juice. It was very good.

Service was excellent and when it turned out we had to leave abruptly they were very gracious and understanding. I'll be back for a main course some day."}
{"text":"This place is good but there are two things that take it over the edge: rosemary in your napkin and foie gras flan!"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for a short vacation and.booked a reservation at this restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. One hour before our scheduled reservation we received a phone call informing us that they were canceling our reservation due to the fact that it was raining and they could not accommodate people on their patio. I mentioned that we had never been asked if we wish to sit on the patio or not I was informed that they just arbitrarily assigned some of their patrons there. Is amazing to me they would choose to ruin half of their clients evening rather than figuring out how to make accommodations for inclement weather."}
{"text":"We came for brunch on a weekday and got there at 1:30 and the restaurant closes at 2pm.   We were made to feel unwelcome - we were the only guests there and were rushed.  The waiter appeared annoyed that we were there.  My husband ordered octopus which came out burnt and overcooked.  I ordered a grilled cheese which came out burnt also.  When I asked for a glass of wine, the waiter again seemed annoyed.  As soon as we were done, before we even left the restaurant, he hopped on his bike and rode away.  For a restaurant that has such great reviews and supposedly great food, I would have expected more class."}
{"text":"Q: When is $250.00 not good enough? A: When you decide to spend it at Virtu's. Last night we went there for dinner, and since one person in our party was older and under the weather, we asked if we could be accommodated inside since it was a cold Phoenix night. They did, and the rest was a disaster. The waitress's opening comment in the first 5 minutes (before even serving us water), \"You should order your drinks quickly since this table is already reserved at 8 for the next party.\" Mind you, it was not even 7 pm yet. She practically refused to take the appetizer order unless we had our entrees picked out already saying, \"Chef likes everything to be put in at once.\" Soup Nazi a bit?  We told her we are not big eaters and depending on the 2 large/overpriced appetizers we might only do 2 or 3 entrees for the 4 of us. But that was not good enough. So we did end up ordering too much food, which then we had to box up!
Now let's talk about the food and prices. The wine list is acceptably short but all the bottles are 50 dollars and over, average price in the 70 dollar range. Bit pricey for a non-steakhouse, casual evening out. Glass of wine 16.00, cocktails 16.00. The famous, over-hyped charred octopus? It is well-made but low on portion size, and they do that spreading-out-tiny-portions-on-large-plate BS. The pork chop was large (meh), the linguine with polpo (24 dollars) acceptable but served like spaghetti and meat sauce in a diner, my flat iron steak had a good crust but was chewy, and I specifically asked the waitress about that. Desserts were well done (panna cotta and pumpkin mousse). 
My takeaway? If you are a new restaurant, determined to charge NYC/SFO prices, by all means do that, it is your prerogative. But, in exchange have a well-trained wait staff, teach them that food is only part of the experience of dining out, that when people drop good money at your establishment, they expect courteousness, and civility. The hype about one signature dish will only carry you so far. If you have an outside seating area, make it habitable in the cold desert nights. And something that every restaurateur should know about Phoenix: word of mouth will make or break you."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio and it's really an attractive looking spot. Romantic and cute. The appetizer was delicious, our cocktails were strong and tasty, and my entree (the flank steak) was pretty solid. I wouldn't say amazing. I probably wouldn't order it again. But, for that moment in time, it did what it needed to do.

My only complaint? It's a weird one. I kept getting hit by water. I was very confused for the first ten minutes. I kept telling my girlfriend that it was raining and she thought I was crazy. At one one point a giant drop hit my right hand, and she saw it happen (thank god.) The waiter, walking by me, must have overheard me say something about it and he causally mentioned, as he continued to briskly walk by our table, \"there's a pool on the roof.\"

The couple next to us suddenly piped up, and told us that they too had been getting sprinkled with pool water all night.

When the pool water hit my dinner plate, I started to wonder, \"why aren't they telling people about this?\" I mean look, it's one thing to have a pool above your customers that's drizzling on them. It's another to ask \"inside or outside\" without casually mentioning, \"oh, the front row is in the Shamu splash zone.\" Just tell people, Virtù! That way we can make an informed decision."}
{"text":"This was my first meal in Scottsdale and I was blown away by everything I tasted. I really had no idea that the food overall in this town was so good, and Virtu was hands down the best. In fact, if it were my call they'd have at least one Michelin star. Seriously, one of the best meals I've had in a while. 

The true standouts from everything I tasted were ( and in no particular order) -

The Charred Octopus - the flavors were right on and it was texturally satisfying as it was cooked to perfection. Probably the best octopus I've ever eaten. It's no coincidence that this is one of their most popular items on the menu. 

The Smoked Duck Breast - really good flavor here and again, cooked to perfection. The smokiness is by no means overwhelming, just the right subtlety to know its there yet taste the duck and the plum (which also was subtle and not at all sweet)

The Chicken and Wild Mushroom Cannelloni - well now, maybe I should have put this one on top and listed in order of preference because thinking more about it, this just might be my favorite of all!!! This dish was exceptional! So flavorful. Quintessential happy, comfort food yet was still quite light. The pasta was very delicate and more crepe-like. The earthy yet pleasingly flavorful mushroom jus was spectacular. I'll dream fondly of this dish. 

They have a very nice wine list and creative cocktails. Their signature G&T is the ideal desert libation. Service was just fine too, I was surprised to read negative reviews in this regard. 

I'm not huge on dessert but their sticky toffee cake was fantastic and if I could choose a dessert menu this would be on it. 

If I'm ever back in Scottsdale I will most definitely return to this restaurant. In fact, that Bespoke Inn that it's located in looks like a great place to stay. I definitely have to look into that, though this time not in the heat of the summer."}
{"text":"The place deserves 5 stars for ambiance! To note we did visit during restaurant week so the menu was a bit different than normal and even the server noted some of the dishes were a bit off. I would call the cuisine \"inventive\" meaning you really aren't sure if you will like the dish based on reading the menu- but you are typically pleasantly surprised and sometimes wowed. I was wowed by the octopus and the burratta.. the insalata was creative but missing something. My husband had the pork rib which was memorable and the ceviche which was just plain weird (even for regular ceviche eaters!). The dining experience is top notch.. so worthy of a visit."}
{"text":"so this is the new trendy spot in Scottsdale. Love the ambiance and small feel vibe. The patio is awesome...can't wait for fall to sit there. Had some great food and drinks. Spotty behind the bar was awesome. Will be revisiting soon."}
{"text":"This place had an all around excellent upscale experience.  The Ahi was cooked to perfection and everyone else in the party also found the food to be enjoyable.  I also ordered the coconut creme brulé, it was very light and offered a great way to complete the meal."}
{"text":"This was an exceptional dining experience.  The service and food were both top quality, this was one of the best meals I've ever experienced.  We started with the grilled asparagus, then followed with the butternut squash gnocchi, next was the smoked duck, and finished with two deserts, the butterscotch and the sticky pudding.    The gnocchi was a must  try, delicate pillows of delightfulness, surrounded with a gorgonzola cream sauce, topped with walnuts, pears and prosciutto.   The duck was cooked to perfection, we ordered medium as opposed to the recommended medium rare and it was delicious.   My first time here, I can't believe I've lived in the area for several years and not been to Virtu before.  I will be back, likely on my way to becoming a regular."}
{"text":"I tried grilled octopus, pork ragu & toffee cake. Everything was delicious. I wish my stomach was bigger than it already is. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I went here for lunch and sat on their great patio. Crepes were great and bigger than most places, grilled octopus was excellent! Very reasonable prices, Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went to Virtu in a group of five to celebrate a birthday. Meal and service were both excellent.

We ordered the octopus, asparagus, and tartare apps. All were cooked perfectly. Octopus was the favorite.

Main courses we ordered the trout, gnocchi, duck, and spare ribs. Was able to sample all dishes. There was not a bad dish among them. Highly recommend the gnocchi and duck.

Desert was the sticky toffee cake and a custard. The cake was a bit dry, but both were very flavorful.

Meal was excellent and will definately be coming back."}
{"text":"The food, staff, & attention to innovative food  creation make this a must return to venue.
After eating at  5 allegedly \"top \" Scottsdale restaurants this week, 
Virtu  in comparison, makes the  5 \"top\" seem average.
If Virtu keeps up their amazing creative effort- won't be able to get a table agin until next August!"}
{"text":"Best meal I have had in years... from the rosemary sprig in the napkin, to the most delicious cocktail I've ever had (the Fortified Truth), delicious perfectly cooked octopus, the wonderful asparagus, the very best flat iron steak and a lovely budino... oh my, cannot wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Just another..Amazing,Wonderful restaurant in old town !! My waiter surprised me with BIRTHDAY Decadent house special homemade dessert...\"not from a box\" they cook with a conscience ... I had the grilled  calamari and lemon Regatta pancake's yummmm... Quit lovely ... For traveler's this is an amazing place to stay. Hotel above and laid  back vib...great music wonderful patio area ...They made it a easy 5 Stars!!"}
{"text":"I made a dinner reservation but when we got there our table wasn't ready. That was weird. The food was very good and I enjoyed the presentation when our food was brought to us. The waiter took time to explain our dishes to us and made sure everything was satisfactory. The restaurant started getting busy so towards the end of our meal the service became neglected. Overall the evening was very enjoyable. I would like to go back again."}
{"text":"I like that this place isn't too stuffy or take themselves too seriously. I enjoyed our cocktails, great wine list by the glass, and excellent seafood. Dessert was tasty too, but for a key lime type dessert (served in a cute little glass jar), but it was too warm and the texture was a bit slimy. All things considered, I would revisit next time I'm in town and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go again because:

Flies- Flies everywhere and landed on food throughout meal (I counted 9 that I could see in our section).  When I asked for them to do something they said it's because there's an olive tree outside.  Regardless of landscaping outside I don't like it to effect my indoor dining.

Service- waitress (Ana) wasn't pleasant and had a minor attitude when I asked questions about bringing our apps out (I saw them on the counter for 10 mins before asking her about it).

Waitress slightly over poured my wine at the bar and she poured it back in the bottle before serving to me.

Food: 
1 star: duck confit bennie- duck was super dry
2 star: classic crepe- huge portion but crepe was thicker than typical \"French crepe\" 
3 star: pork rillete- pork itself was tasty w pickled sides but bread was burnt
3 star: burrata; well served w salad
5 star: cup of fresh fruit drizzled w honey (came w bennie and not something you cook)

Price: standard prices compared to San Francisco brunch; not sure how to compare to Phoenix pricing"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous meal here.  The setting is lovely, outdoors surrounded by the restaurant and inn.  The waiter was very helpful in describing the dishes and encouraging one of our party in deciding which entree to order based on their preferences.  
The octopus small plate was tasty but overcooked, a minor negative in the whole meal.  The asparagus small plate with the duck egg, bacon and feta was delicious.  
My husband ordered the squid ink pasta with octopus.  Octopus was perfectly done with just the right amount of garlic and parmesan.
I ordered the smoked duck with foie gras flan.  The duck was also perfectly done and the flan was incredible.  I was afraid it would be lacking the foie gras flavor but each bite was to die for!  
The frites that came with it were very high in cinnamon which went well with the duck but was dry.  The rest of the plate was superlative.  The apricot gel that came with it complimented it perfectly.
Our cocktails were excellent as was the Calabrian wine that we ordered.  Service was perfect!
We look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Get here, by any means necessary. Its a beautiful restaurant, with the most incredible food & spot on service. Ive never ever tasted anything as good as the sticky toffee pudding. Ever. We also had the charred octopus (amazing), the tuna tartare (fantastic), the butternut squash gnocchi (incredible) etc.. (running out of adjectives). You should go now!"}
{"text":"Great Service! Great ambiance! Great food! Need I say more? Scottsdale's best!"}
{"text":"I don't get what Howard Seitfel sees in this place. It was fine, but below other restaurants in the valley that aspire to this level. My co-worker found the grilled octopus to be disappointing and below Talavera's (given his extensive time in Portugal I'm inclined to trust his judgment). My fish meal was not noticably better than Wildfish or Olive + Ivy.  Ambience is strange, sandwiched in a motel's courtyard. Service was indifferent and the meal dragged. Maybe that negatively influenced my view.... 

Relatedly, who is this Esquire critic?  CPH wasn't that great either..."}
{"text":"Epicurious excellence, if you want to treat yourself to a special dinner this is the place.  The outside patio feels like a garden picnic while inside looks like an upscale French bistro. Service was top notch.  The food was flavorful and distinctive.  We started with the octopus which was tender and had a subtle spiciness that brought the bbq octopus flavors to the forefront. The scallops we're perfectly cooked on a bed chorizo and chickpeas that combined for a unique dish.  If you still have room for desert the sticky chocolate pudding with truffle caramel sauce is a must.

I will definitely have dinner again at Virtu next time I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Out of this World!  Food quality 10+, interesting menu.  Small, cozy, intimate feel.  Can't wait to go back.  Very romantic."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Great food - octopus and bucatini were outstanding. Toffee cake is a must...one of the best desserts I've ever had. Cozy small restaurant with great service - I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Simply stated, Virtu is the absolute best in class for gastronomical fare, impeccable service and flawless execution. Having traveled Asia, Europe, North and South America and the Middle East on countless occasions - and having dined at some of the very best rated venues this world has to offer - I rank this jewel of an establishment a Michelin 3 star and an absolute must visit and repeat! It simply does not get better, pointe finale!"}
{"text":"Had business brunch today. The Tortilla Espanola was just like Mom used to make. My guest had the sliced duck sandwich. Looked great (I'm sure it tasted just as good. Didn't think it was good idea to ask for a bite. Service was great. Must come back for dinner and try some great Spanish dishes. Kudos to Chef Gio and his staff. Much success going forward."}
{"text":"All around great experience. From the ambience to the delicious food. The octopus was by far the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"With all the hype about this place we had to try it for brunch with the full intention of returning for dinner.  Nestled into this wonderful boutique hotel we were expecting a 5 star brunch.  What we got were two dishes that were bland and aesthetically unpleasing.  Both dishes were highly recommended by our server who BTW was equally as bland.  Nothing special here.  Over rated and overpriced."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more.  There were many positives and yet also some negatives that brought the experience down.  Overall, the food was very good and unique. I felt the portions could be bigger for what they gave you.  People in our party ordered the scallops and they said they were terrific but they only got 3 scallops (for $28) and finished their meal hungry. I got the pork chop which was a better-sized portion and also tasted good, but there was a fair amount of fat on the cut. 

As others have mentioned on here, the service speed wasn't the best.  Sometimes it was prompt, other times it was slow. The major issue I had was after we ordered beer and wine mid-meal as it took over 15 minutes to receive. Our server kept on saying they were coming. When I approached the bar to speak with the manager to find out what the issue was, the bartender told me she was the manager in a condescending tone (unprovoked), and when I mentioned that we had been waiting a while, she pointed to the drinks at the bar and said \"they're right here\". No apology, no \"sorry, we're busy\", but I calmly asked asked a question and for whatever reason her response was in a unprofessional, unapologetic tone. To the server's credit, he took the blame and apologized. He also comp'ed us that round. It was just unfortunate to have that experience with the manager and the service delays as it soured what could have been a very good dining experience."}
{"text":"The layers of flavor and texture here are exquisite. Someone who gets all of the subtleties of food and delights in entertaining your senses is in charge of the menu. Barrata, branzino and berries with lemon cream. Don't miss it. Drink magicians, the Ice Queen, have it. The only great octopus ever prepared."}
{"text":"Excellent food, cocktails, and location. The scallops entree was the best I have had all year."}
{"text":"We started with the octopus and then had the duck and tagliatelle for dinner. Incredible ambiance and restaurant. I would highly recommend this for a date night!"}
{"text":"First, how I came to know about this restaurant? I googled scottsdale best restaurant and virtu is No. 1 on the top ten list. However, I was disappointed with the overall dining experience there. 
1. kitchen ventilation is bad and it has open kitchen which made me smell weird when I left the restaurant. 
2. Food is pricey, taste is nothing to shout about... 
3. Portion is small!!!
I have ordered scallop entree and there were ONLY 3 scallop in my plates and it costs $30. I would rather enjoy my scallop meal at North, Common Kierland. 
4. The restaurant is small. No privacy.
The only 1 star that I could give is the service. Service is good. 
This would be my first and last visit of this restaurant. Simply not worth for the money that we spent!
How it got rated no. 1 restaurant in Scottsdale? I think it is just because of the marketing !! In conclusion, this place  is over- priced and underwhelming!!"}
{"text":"We are not negative people and we really enjoy dining. I have to admit I don't understand what everybody is raving about!!!

Let's start with the outside dining, so raved about. Sitting outside, wow, not charming, no misters, 90° at night.  But we came for the food and the rave reviews, right? And as the server pointed out as we sat down, this restaurant was one the Top 25 new restaurants in America from Esquire magazine! But wait, that was when they opened more than five years ago apparently as I later discovered (and I never before heard that Esquire Magazine is the standard for fine dining . . .

Fast forward to the MEAL The server kept pushing and pushing us to order. He said he wanted to keep the kitchen going and not delay our meal. It was 6 PM, restaurant not busy yet but anyway. 

And be prepared, the menu is NOT what you see online. they have four or five \"small plates\", and then two pasta dishes, and then for the main course they have five or so items. The menu changes the server told us every day. OK, nice concept. But the menu that we were presented was woefully short of choices and interest for all four of us except for one fish entrée.

The reviews you will read and on their website rave about the octopus \"small plate\". Well, I consider myself an expert in seafood having eaten it all my life and living in places where fresh seafood is steps away.  Honestly it was one of the most boring, bland presentations of octopus that I have ever had. And I'm being nice. It was so mediocre that I struggle to understand the other opinions of how special it is.

My partner had the hockey tuna, small plate. Emphasis on SMALL PLATE at $17. Fresh Augie, incredibly small quantity.

So then I finally understood what they are trying to get you to do. They want everyone to order a small plate which is a fancy word for appetizer, but the appetizers are $17-$20 alone. Then they want you to split a pasta dish of which there were only two. Let me now get to the pasta. Of the two specials we chose the highly recommended by our waiter pasta, egg, and tomato dish.  UGH .... again I'm sorry to have to say this but it was awful, had a very strange flavor, was not appealing or appetizing. We tried to share it but took about two bites each and said that was enough. $25 or so was the charge.

The two of us decided not to continue ordering any more food from the menu because we were so disappointed. Our couple partners who joined us decided to split the swordfish which was a special of the day. This was the only bright spot in the entire evening and meal. It was very very good. We had a taste.

And then back to our server. You'll notice that some of the reviews say that the waitstaff pushed and pushed people. Well our waiter did the same. He constantly pushed us and it made for a very rushed feeling uncomfortable dining experience. Clearly they wanted to turn the table.

Summary -summary overpriced, not charming at all, not comfortable outside seating, and except for one item on the menu, everything else a huge disappointment. I'm very forgiving but I would never go back and I recommend you pass on this one. It may have been good when it opened five or six years ago but no more. Sorry, I wanted to be impressed but wasn't ..."}
{"text":"Second meal here. Brunch this time. Confirmed 100% amazing. The crepe was to die for. Rich. Cotton candy ham. Nice wine list. Dinner even better. Great atmosphere, lovely waitress. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"I have been there twice while visiting the city. I am really impressed for the high level of the restaurant. Amazing food. The menu for dinner is more impressive than brunch. I would recommend for dinner and don't forget to book a table, they are always busy."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Will definitely be returning for future special celebrations!

Must-order:
- Octopus
- Asparagus
- Cornish Hen (slightly gamey, the brine adds incredible depth. good choice if you like chicken!)
- Sticky toffee cake"}
{"text":"WOW! Best kale salad ever, scrumptious pappardelle with pork sugo, super helpful and knowledgeable waiter, fun vibe.  It doesn't get better than this!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend Virtu.  With so many options for dinner in Phoenix I find it difficult to give any good review of the food or service.

I have been to Virtu for Brunch with girlfriends and the food was good.  My husband and I decided to go for dinner on a Tuesday and were excited about a great meal.  We were promptly seated at our table, which the venue is fantastic, but waited for some time and had to ask a passing server if we could order a drink.  We ordered a bottle of wine and a beer.  Our server briefly discussed the food and provided a \"taste\" of the wine and walked away.  There was definitely a feeling of our server being either over committed to tables or just didn't care about a two top.  Our server walked passed us on several occasions without paying any attention.  We ended up asking another server if they could take our order.  I think that is enough said about service.  

We ordered the hen and the buccatini.  The hen was over cooked...burnt skin, tough to cut and the buccatini was dull in flavor and chewy...not al dente.  Our waiter never came to check on our meal until we had asked another server for the check.  He offered to comp our meal, but that wasn't our objective.  We wanted out.  Maybe 5 bites each and didn't want to try and redeem or eat for free.  

For a restaurant that has such great reviews and a reputation for culinary achievements, I can not say that I would ever return.  There are far too many competing restaurants in a similar price point and ambiance to ever return."}
{"text":"This was the best dinner that I've had in the Valley.  We had the asparagus, octopus, and pork rib chop-- everything was absolutely delicious.  The ambiance was great, service was excellent, we enjoyed the wine by the glass selection, and we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Virtu has been our favorite, \"go-to\" place for special occasions. Alas, no longer. The atmosphere has changed from warm/friendly to snotty attitude. On our last visit, the waiter was condensing in up-selling, almost lecturing us on \"what most people order.\" The funniest thing is the restaurant tables are not large enough to accommodate sharing dishes.

The menu has always been limited, but has shifted to the exotic (rabbit? quail?) and extreme (40 oz steak for two people...most restaurants in Scottsdale offer an 8 or 10 oz filet...Virtu sells 20 oz per person!). Until recently, Virtu had no real salad selection on their menu and NO vegetable options.

On the positive, the quality of the food we ordered was just as good as in the past. Unfortunately, the \"new\" attitude detracted tremendously and we won't return. I think the celebrity of a James Beard nomination has gone to everyone's head at Virtu. Very sad!"}
{"text":"We had a bridal shower here, and they did a great job!  We took over the courtyard patio area, and it was such a pretty space.  The server in charge of our party kept our drinks well filled.  The brunch food was sooooo yummy!  Then the desserts came out, and I was in heaven!  If I lived in Scottsdale, I would make this a regular brunch spot for sure!"}
{"text":"It took 3 hours to get served an average of two dishes per person.  I'm totally perplexed by the positive reviews.  I had the octopus and it was the worst I ever had.  It was extremely dry and salty.  The presentation was nice but the place was so dimly lit it was really difficult to appreciate.  There were plenty of people serving but only two people that we could see who were cooking.  They should think about balancing that out a little more so that diners won't have to spend three hours to complete a two course dinner.  The last time I spent that long at dinner was at the French Laundry.  The only difference was that was a 10 course dinner.  I do remember another 3 hour dinner at Gary Danko's in San Francisco.  That turned out to feel like a 90 minute experience as none of us wanted that to end!

Also, there was no bread served to at least keep us occupied.  They did an excellent job of keeping our water glasses filled.

Seriiously, how can you keep diners waiting almost an hour after their orders have been placed and 45 minutes between the first and second course?  The server never offered an apology for the slow service.  

Sorry, the food didn't make up for the poor service."}
{"text":"Just. Skip. It. Poor service meets even worse food. Smoke billowing from the kitchen. A $23 plate of pasta with burnt tomato sauce and a total of 8 noodles. The plus is that the manager made it right. In class act fashion. Only disappointed that the circumstances required him to do so."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food!! We had brunch and the bloody Mary's were great and the Pancakes were to die for! The atmosphere was superb!"}
{"text":"A colleague and I tried this place while in Tempe for a business trip. I reserved a table for us, based on a recommendation in an article I read in Sunset magazine. Per the article's suggestion, we of course had the octopus. We put together the rest of the meal based on two other starters - the asparagus and the chicken liver mousse, plus the bread salad. All of the food was delightful to look at and to taste. The shared salad came plated on two plates - easy to enjoy with plenty of goat cheese for both. 

Overall, the service was attentive without being overly so. The food was great - highly recommend the octopus! Looking forward to another trip to this restaurant, perhaps for lunch."}
{"text":"Celebrated a friends birthday at this fine establishment. We didn't regret it! 
We shared a number of small plates and an entree. Everything you read about the octopus is true. It's by far the best octopus we've ever had. We also shared the perfectly cooked asparagus. And the burrata salad was excellent. We had mixed reviews on the beef tartare. But the Moscovy duck entree was absolutely perfect. 
The chef sent out a delectable caramel toffee chocolate cake for the finale. 
I would go again and again! Our server Evan was fun and made our experience memorable."}
{"text":"Dinner early Saturday was great. Pepper pappardelle with pork ragu, scallops and flat iron steak were all very nice, as was the burrata and octopus starters. Sticky toffee and brandied cherries over marscapone gelato great way to end a meal. Service attentive but not intrusive. The inside seating can be a bit crowded and there's no escaping the sounds of the bar.  Outside tends to be a bit lower volume, but be prepared for the warm summer evenings."}
{"text":"Bad service with great food?!  Well let me first highlight the service, we got this server Mateo, and I think he needs more training.  I will highlight which I think is the negative for this review of this server:

1. We did not feel welcome, coming in to this place - Did not even say \"Welcome to Virtu\" or something like that.  All he said \"So anything to drink?\".  Didn't even asks if it was our first time or not... I got a better welcoming service from Village Inn.
2. Does not know the menu.  My wife asked him for some recommendation, and he said \"Pretty much everything here is good..\" While that maybe the truth, as a server you got to at least try to recommend some of the food or any special about the food (did not even mention anything if there are any special food in the menu) that the chef offers.  No clue.
3. My wife did not like the tea (something wrong with the taste), so we asked him if we could return the tea and get coffee instead.  He did not even bother to ask what was wrong with the tea and just said \"sure\".  I mean, at least asks us why?!  Did not care at all.
4.  When we got our drinks, it took forever for him to get our order.  I watched him just talking to the other waiters and did not even acknowledged us if we are ready to order.
5. When we finally got our food, (someone else gave us the food by the way), not once he came over and asks us how we were doing.  The only time we saw him is to gave us the check.

Terrible service...I would probably stay away from this server.  You've been warned!!!

And now for the food...we ordered French Toast and it was very delicious.  I can say that the grilled squid was excellent.  My wife had the Pork Ragu and that was very delicious too.

if it wasn't for the excellent food, we would have probably not enjoy the experience.  But sometimes a bad service, even if you have great food, you leave the place with a bad taste in your mouth (like a bad after taste)."}
{"text":"Love this gem. We've been here for a late lunch just a halh an hour before theirs closing time.
We tried the classic crepe which was pretty good but the chersy polenta with pork ragu was awesome.
Nice little, intimate place to go."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!  Hidden gem! This restaurants' taste is world class.  I enjoy 99% of the staff, only have had one less than stellar server. He honestly kind of dampers the whole experience with his attitude.  He works the bar in the morning sometimes short guy.  Not really sure why he works there.   Anyway  I highly recommend you try the crepe, French toast, or pancakes for brunch and anything on the dinner menu! ( burrata, pumpkin gnocchi, pork chop). Please give this restaurant your business. They deserve it.  One of the highest quality restaurants in old town."}
{"text":"I was treated to a fabulous dining experience in celebration of my recent birthday.  Mateo was our server on Sunday evening and we couldn't have asked for a more knowledgeable or efficient person.  After reading the excellent reviews on the charred octopus and asparagus appetizers, that's what we ordered.  SO glad we did . . . neither disappointed.  For our entrees, we ordered the orato and the scallops . . . both an excellent choice.  The blending of tastes and textures in everything we ordered was beyond comparison.  Virtu is a small and charming place with a large heated patio for outdoor dining.  A perfect evening all around."}
{"text":"Girl date!  Weekday night around 7 pm.  This spot is tucked away!

Love the patio ambiance but I guess you need a reservation typically.  Apparently they \"threw out\" thier tequila and did not have any so I could not try the margarita.  We sit inside & enjoy a glass of wine each. Lambrusco for me and barbera for my friend.  Her wine is leathery and very bold and my Lambrusco is light and sparkling.

Starting with the pumpkin risotto- our server says the chef is a \"risoto snob\" so it's quite good.  Love the confidence and the dish!  Chorizo and shaved cheese on top make it an easy a+. The temperature was perfect which enhanced the dish for me.

We also share the beet salad.  This is a lovely presentation of scattered radishes, berries, dressing, and homemade crackers with a goat cheese circle in the middle.  This is an accent dish moreso than a filling entree salad.

We shared the halibut cheeks which are basically a fish & chips style with battered asparagus, pickle, carrots, hot pepper, and of course the fish.  This also comes with a garlic vinegar sauce, white ranch style dipping sauce and a piquillo pepper sauce.  Normally I avoid anything fried but this was Delish!

The dessert was the Nutella bundito- though the server recommended the toffee pudding we wanted this or the olive oil cake.  Sooo happy we choose the Nutella dessert- our favorite dish of the evening.  We loved the sea salt and caramel drizzle and the sea salt and whip on the gooey Nutella yumminess.

Really appreciated the great homey service and inspired cuisine.  Will return with a reservation on the lovely patio!"}
{"text":"As fine a restaurant as anywhere in the world, Virtu earns 5 stars for innovative, delicious, perfectly prepared food.  From our selections last night, we recommend the charred octopus- unlike typical preparations, this was amazingly sweet and tender; the grilled branzino with arugula, carmelized onions and a sauce so good, I don't know how they made it.   Smoked duck was prepared with home made hummus that made the dish.   The chef went above and beyond last night.  It was my friend's birthday  and we were treated to two special deserts.  One a sticky toffee pudding with foie gras that was one of the top 3 dishes I have ever experienced, in addition to a perfect chocolate souffle with carmel sauce.
Reasonably priced for an extraordinary dining experience.  Friendly, knowlegeable staff.  Casual atmosphere with patio.  Will most definitely return.  Thank you, chef!"}
{"text":"My experience is very different from the rest of the reviews.  Saw it on \"Check Please,\" that reviewed as a 10! Well, my view was much different, where we sat was awful, the wait person thought that he was much better then the patron, food was very expensive I have eaten in much nicer place for less money. $25. 00 for 2 shots of whiskey, total $136.00 + tip . I had Beef Tatar and very salty Scallops, wife had glass of wine, Octopus and pasta. Place was over crowded and very noisy, will never return!"}
{"text":"What an amazing night! Myself and my wife celebrated our 1 year anniversary here and what a great choice. My wife loves a new menu experience and Virtu has that plus amazing drinks. Great BandB and awesome ambience."}
{"text":"Absolutely a must!  Appetizers - asparagus, barratta and octopus all well done.  Pork chop amazing.  And dessert a wow.  Possibly the best meal I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Great food, romantic ambiance, and good service. Worth the price for dinner ($130 for two before tip)."}
{"text":"Virtu is a beautiful, intimate restaurant. I'd consider it one of the best in the valley. We go to virtu whenever there's something special to celebrate. You have to get the octopus, it always surprises us how amazing it is. They have a nice cocktail menu and mocktails as well. We always look forward to the next reason to celebrate. It's going to be an expensive dinner but that's ok- it's worth every penny. The staff is great, hey change out silverware between courses. Two big thumbs up."}
{"text":"We went because I'd heard good things about the cocktails. Although both the venue and the menu are much smaller than the other well-reputed cocktail bars in the valley (Crudo, Bitter & Twisted, etc) the quality is absolutely on par with those bars. A guy named Max took care of us, and rather than order off of the menu he made us multiple rounds of drinks of his own creation based on our likes and dislikes. He was spot on every time and was great company as well. We shared a few items off of the food menu, the best of which was the asparagus with duck egg. The kitchen was visible, which I always like."}
{"text":"The food here is seriously some of the best in AZ... we've been here twice now. If it weren't for it being on the pricey side we'd be there more often! The grilled octopus was amazing, so was the pasta, and scallops, and the cocktails are crazy good! They served a cocktail with fresh strawberries, champagne foam, and topped it with black pepper- I've ever had anything like it. Will be thinking about this place until I go back :)"}
{"text":"Virtu is as good as I remember.  The menu choices are amazing.  Tonight I had the pig head appetizer and halibut main.  Where else can you get such a selection.  Sorry Ivan,  you have been dethroned by Heidi.  Great server and easier on the eyes"}
{"text":"We came here on a quiet afternoon and it was superb. The food was decadent, the atmosphere was calming and the service was delightful. We ordered the burger and the charro eggs. Both were great. Loved how they changed the menu daily to keep it fresh. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's right off the main drag of old towne. It's a small restaurant that has both indoor and outdoor seating. The service is wonderful and the food is phenomenal. We tried the duck, octopus, asparagus and scallops! It was all amazing. The portions are perfect size and for desert we had the rocky road flourless. Which is so chocolatey and delicious!  I will be back for sure to try something completely different. I must try everything on their menu!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch last Sunday. Requested and received an outside seating table. Cocktails were above average. Appetizer and main course were both delicious. And dessert (dark chocolate chili budino) was exceptional. A couple of tables around us did complain about delay in cocktails and service. However, we had no issues. Will return again for dinner."}
{"text":"Nice hidden gem in Scottsdale. Food was amazing (burrata app & flat iron steak were standouts), and service was impeccable. Small place with about 12 tables. Absolutely loved it and will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is such a lovely gem in old town Scottsdale. We sat on their shaded patio and had the classic crepe and a chocolate scone for breakfast. Enough for 2 people and delicious! Our server, Ana, was fabulous. This is my new favorite brunch spot. And I also must mention that the ambiance is amazing."}
{"text":"Small menu that changes probably changes with the season.  Nice ambiance.  Tried the octopus for a starter.  I wasn't a fan although my friend liked it.  I had the gnocchi and was delicious.  Bob had the pork chop which was okay.  Great service.  You may need a sophisticated palate to truly enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for brunch in Old Town! 

The restaurant was fully booked for dinner, so we decided to go for brunch. It ended up being the absolute best brunch I have ever had. 

You will not be disappointed with the chistorra and eggs, as well as the refreshing Strawberry Fields non-alcoholic drink! 

The location is beautifully decorated and quiet--despite the raging Scottsdale club scene being only a few blocks away. 

Our waiter was very friendly and genuinely interested in making sure we had a great experience. He also recommended a great port for post-brunch drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and it was astonishing! Their menu contains items you probably won't see anywhere else. Their eggs benidict comes with a unique twist and the Nutella crepe-- absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"So far, this is my favorite restaurant in the area. We moved here in September 2014, and have tried many restaurants. We went to Virtù twice and LOVED it both times. The staff is knowledge and interested, the food is satisfying, almost to a fault (:-) and the prices are more than acceptable for what you get. The place is so cozy, you feel like you want to stay all night. We sat outdoors the first time, and it was nice and quaint, and the indoor seating is just as perfect! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal.  Burrata was a generous portion and the honeycomb added a great touch.  The strip steak was also a large portion and melt in your mouth tender while very flavorful.  The lavender cake was a great finish to a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Today the butterscotch budino almost caused me to have a When Harry Met Sally moment on the patio.  It was my second visit, the last one was dinner and today lunch.  This food is so creative, fresh, and the atmosphere is quaint, relaxed, and elegant. Love it.  Beer and Wine only a lunch."}
{"text":"Really great food!!! I loved the seasonal pasta. I loved the great ambiance. It's very romantic and cozy. We sat outside so it was a bit chilly, but they did have heaters. I recommend trying this place out. I definitely want to go back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch, food deserves a five but greeting by host was snooty and total bs, plenty of tables on arrival and more available  when we left. Imaginative wine list, it's a shame same host felt the need to hype a good product with our table and overheard at others. Again food was great if you can stomach or better yet ignore host and server was good. Crepes, steak, octopus were all excellent."}
{"text":"The 5 Stars is for the bar and the budino. We did not have dinner. Bartender Chad was so gracious to give us a little cocktail lesson while we enjoyed our expertly crafted drinks and dessert. I will definitely be back for dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"5 stars! My wife took me here for my birthday dinner.  We rated the food and the experience in our top five resturants ever.  The food was perfect and the atmosphere of the small french bistro setting is the ideal.  Well worth the price."}
{"text":"Virtu certainly has all the right pieces in place.  First the restaurant is beautiful and cozy and though a tad dark, is romantic and is decorated well - particularly on the patio.  It is very inviting as were the staff when we arrived.  I am familiar with the Virtu concept as we dine often in their sister restaurant Nico's Heirloom Kitchen in DT Gilbert.  Many of the food items are identical if not similar but our waiter was quick to point out that they changed their menu daily as opposed to Nico's who changed it much less frequently.

As we ordered drinks I was somewhat taken back by the wine glass prices.  Sitting between $14 to $17 a glass I ordered one of the two Pinot Noirs on the list to which the server responded that it was a feminine wine.  I've had Pinots be described as light bodied but never feminine but I understood what he meant and so I switched to the -cough- manly and more expensive PInot at $17.  If was OK but certainly average and served at what felt like warmer than room temp which was disappointing.    

We also had a few mixed drinks which we found to be exceptional including the Amante Appassionato and their \"special G&T\".  Nice work from behind the bar at Virtu!

The waiter then took our order and stated that people usually order X number of sides and then an entree which just screamed to me as a bit of a transparent up sale.  I get the up sale working in the biz for over a decade and even helping guests with the menu but there is an art to it and this young waiter lacked the tact and polish needed to do it well. It came off snobby which did not sit well with me.  

We ordered a few Burrata, Octopus, and Grilled Asparagus to share at the table before our entrees.  The Burrata was great and the the Octopus was a standout and amazingly tender.  If you don't like Octopus because of the texture you should try it here.  The Asparagus had a duck egg atop which I love but this egg had a very strong sulfur smell that was a turn off.  So much so that my buddy kept asking if there was a sewer gas issue to which I just kept silent on.  

 For an entree I ordered the duck which was well prepared and cooked to the right temperature but the flavors did not wow me.  My other friend ordered the last available portion of the scallops which had a very strong (bad) fishy smell to them.  I would have ordered them as well but was glad I didn't once I smelled them leaving me to wonder if they had sat around a day too long. 

If I had never been to Nico's I would likely have enjoyed this more.  In the back of my mind I kept coming back to the fact that I was paying double to eat the same food I do in Gilbert just because I was in Scottsdale.  Perhaps worse I've never had anything suspect (scallops and duck egg) at Nico's ever.  I get that their rent and other expenses are higher but if you are going to charge that much you should distinguish it a bit more which they did not.  Our large party averaged out to $240 per couple even after keeping my drinks on the light side.  That combined with the over played up sale just pushed me to a 3-star for a likely 4-star joint."}
{"text":"We received excellent service from our knowledgeable server who helped us choose delicious starters, a pasta course and main dish.  I suggest sharing everything with your dining companion so you can wrap your taste-buds around as many of the chef's selections as possible."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a colleague and had an amazing experience.   I had the smoked duck sandwich and the pink peppercorn peach cobbler for dessert.  
Both were well balanced!  The depth of flavor had my taste buds singing.
I looked at the dinner menu and I have to say I wish I could go back for the pan seared scallops.  

However I will be back to enjoy the flavors that this gem is producing!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is all about food and wine.

Creative, delicious, exciting.

Selections are deliberate, fresh and absolutely worth the investment.  

The staff provides exceptional service.

Majority of seating it's outside on a very nice patio.

This restaurant is most appreciated by adults"}
{"text":"Terrific food. Always good. Usually go for dinner but had brunch this weekend. Excellent. Lemon ricotta pancakes are really good. Knowledgeable servers and overall good service. 
Good variety on the wine list with reasonable prices.
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved out brunch experience at Virtu yesterday! We had been here once for dinner and decided to try it for brunch. If you are a fan of quaint restaurants and inventive cuisine, then this is the place to try! Their patio is great if the weather is nice too. Their lemon ricotta pancakes were the best pancakes that I have EVER had! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Chef Osso has made a collection of different cuisines that make my pallet yearn for more. From the start with a Moscow Mule to the end with actions shot espresso, the service was perfect. From the starter plate of Charred Octopus being do amazingly tender and flavorful to the smoked, yet medium-rare duck breast that I completely enjoyed. Both paired well with a bottle of Zinfandel from their wine list. A must try restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is my most favorite restaurant.  The setting is absolutely charming, close to the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.  One is greeted promptly and in the most welcoming way.  The menu selections rely on local and seasonal foods, which makes for a great dining experience.  The staff is knowledgeable about the food and wines. Specialty cocktails are also quite tasty and varied.  The food is cooked to perfection and tastes so, so good.  One can choose to eat inside or out.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Four of us dined together during restaurant week. We ordered the octopus as an app and for entrees fish, the pasta and the flat iron steak. We all thoroughly enjoyed or meals and the drinks were also excellent. Would definitely recommend and will certainly return. The only off putting issue was the service. Our server was rather uppity, cold, and rushed. Perhaps due to it being restaurant week she was a bit stressed but, she really made us feel rather unwelcome. Hopefully this is not her typical disposition! In any case I'd been wanting to try the restaurant for some time but, for some reason kept forgetting to put in rotation, but, now that I have done so I will definitely return. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"This Mediterranean/Calabrian restaurant refreshes its menu every week with updated selections and fresh ingredients. We ordered 4 plates and all were terrific. Grilled Asparagus and salad with grilled radishes and turnips for starters. The entrees were pasta (with egg noodles) and scallops - the portions were on the smaller side but the food was perfectly seasoned and very rich so you felt just the right amount of satisfied. Look forward to returning to see what the menu looks like next time."}
{"text":"Wow. Went to dinner here last night for the first time since opening and I can honestly say it was magical. From the moment I walked in till I left, dish after dish, service, and atmosphere were top notch. I did not know that this was a newly opened restaurant.
I walked in with my wife and immediately greeted by the Host named Rick who was very pleasant and sat us quickly with genuine care while carrying on a conversation. This was a sign of more great things to come is what I was thinking to myself. 
Chris our server was awesome. He immediately greeted us and made us feel incredibly welcomed and we knew we were in good hands. After suggesting a few cocktails and various wines he then moved onto the dinner menu and suggested some great dishes along with paring to our wine of choice. 
Once our order was placed, the Chef then came out to greet us. Chef Gio, the proprietor was warm and friendly offering his suggestions as well. He then made his way through the dining room making everyone feel like they were home. 
From the first dish, we were in heaven. I would write what we had from course to course, but I think that's what makes this restaurant so great and what will make this one of the best you'll ever try is the fact that it continues to change its menu daily. 
Anyway, from our first course through the main, it truly took us to a new heightened sense of taste ecstasy that I have not experienced here in the valley. Everything was cooked to perfection and the ingredients were of the freshest local and regional flavors that I have ever had in their combinations. 
Dessert at the end was just the perfect conclusion to a much deserved night out. 
The restaurant itself was quaint and tastefully done. It took both of us to a place of elegance yet a comfortable sense of being. Just perfect feel to it.
I will be back and cannot wait to see what Chef Gio will concoct next. I am a believer in this culinary mirage in our fair city. Thanks to the team at Virtu'!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants we've enjoyed in Scottsdale. Warm and welcoming service, creative and delicious food, and a smart, well-priced wine list. We particularly liked the octopus starter (exquisitely tender) and smoked duck entrée (though the veg was a bit muddled). Dessert-wise, both the flourless chocolate cake and duo of crème brulee were wonderfully decadent. Not inexpensive for the full-spread, but certainly a winner for a special dinner in a comfortable setting."}
{"text":"Virtu is located in Scottdale's Old Town.  Intimate little restaurant with patio seating with large umbrellas and heat lamps that will warm your back.  Those umbrellas were actually needed since out of the 330 sunny days per year in Arizona, tonight happened to be a rainy one!  We saw three poor waiters take turns hold an umbrella for a large party across from us until they jury-rigged a temporary cover.  Now that's service!

As for the cuisine, the limited menu has some pretty high-quality eats with more hits than misses:

* They have a pretty sizable cocktail menu. I got the Fortified Truth which has like 5-6 components but I mostly tasted grapefruit juice and cinnamon.  

* The Spanish Octopus with garbanzo beans is their signature dish and was incredibly tender and smokey.  Seasoning was good, just a tad bit saltier that I would have liked.

* Insalata was a minor letdown.  Too much arugula and not enough walnuts or goat cheese.  The octopus dish also comes with arugula so I regretted not getting a different app.

* Scallops with Brussels Sprouts, Chamomile Beurre Blanc, and chestnut puree was a solid dish.  Light, perfectly seasoned.

* Muscovy Duck cooked medium rare was juicy and tender.  The crust was smoky, but was on the saltier side for me.  Either that or the butternut hash with chorizo was over-seasoned.  Maybe you need to drink lots of wine to properly enjoy this dish.  The quince jelly helps add some needed sweetness.

* Sticky Toffee with Salted Caramel Gelato was an excellent dessert - not overly sweet, and nice balance of drier texture from the toffee mixed with the gelato and the sauce at the bottom of the plate.  Great with black coffee!

Solid 4-star restaurant."}
{"text":"No doubt about it, cocktails are the way to go at Virtu. The food, however, is overpriced and sometimes underwhelming.

We arrived to a jam-packed restaurant Tuesday night. I was a bit surprised because it looked like there were plenty of open tables when I made reservations online a couple days prior. I could tell right away that they were in the weeds because of Restaurant Week so I prepared myself for a slower dining experience. We were fine waiting at the bar for our table. We love craft cocktails, and we loved checking out all the obscure liquors and house-made concoctions behind the bar. My husband got the Nuova Bellezza, a grape-based drink, and I got the Fountain of Youth. His drink was very good, and mine was outstanding! I swear, you could get any tequila hater to enjoy this cocktail made with Don Julio reposado and yellow bell pepper syrup. We also had the classic Sazerac and their Starter Kit which was refreshing and slightly bitter.

My husband got the chef starters which was a crostini, blistered peppers and a croqueta. He didn't really like any of them and much preferred my salad. The salad with beets and goat cheese was nice, but the warm temperature indicated it probably sat at the window too long. I got the only vegetarian offering which was a modified (no pancetta) version of butternut squash ravioli. When my dish came to the table, I spotted the pancetta right away and sent it back. In the mean time, my husband got his thick pork chop but no silverware. I gave him my set while I waited, but he was still in need of a steak knife. My redone ravioli came out again fairly quickly, but I had to ask for another set silverware. I was very disappointed looking at the ravioli. The portion was minuscule! Four Chef Boyardee sized goat cheese ravioli with just a touch of brown butter and no butternut squash at all. The ravioli were very good, but thank god I don't have a huge appetite. Surprisingly, the star of my husband's dish wasn't the prosciutto wrapped pork but the phenomenal mushrooms on the side. The pork was moist but didn't have much flavor. My husband said he would have rather had just the mushrooms on top of a risotto. 

We finished off with the affogato and chocolate course for dessert. My husband wasn't a fan of the affogato, but I liked both of them. His chocolate mousse was light and fluffy, and there was a delightful, warm chocolate s'more-like pastry on the side.

Our server was friendly, but she forgot about filling up our water glasses. I was also dismayed that the staff let the restroom run out of hand towels. Nothing like walking back to your table with wet hands.

I could see us returning again for pre-dinner cocktails, but we'll be sticking with FnB nearby for our food."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here on a Monday night and couldn't believe the place was full. We had reservations but chose to sit outside, the waitress brought out a blanked for me just in case I got cold. Let me begin by letting you know they have a very nice selection of wines by the glass! We enjoyed our appetizer very much, we had the asparagus with the poached egg, candied bacon and it was amazing. My husband had the burrata salad that was very delicious. Main entrees didn't disappoint either, I had the duck breast with Moroccan spices chickpeas and eggplant and my husband had the pork chop with blue cheese and fig demi. The only complaint my husband had was that he wished there was more glaze :) We will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent time at the bar. Food and drinks were terrific. It was very busy on a Friday night but service was perfect."}
{"text":"Terrible service right from the moment we entered. The hostess was rude, didn't smile, snapped at me when I didn't walk the direction she was wanting me to go. I was ahead of her in a very tight space. The water that was on the table tasted terrible. If you live in AZ you are more then aware of how terrible our tap water is. I asked the waitress if it was filtered. She said it was, I told her it tasted awful. She said the only other water they had was sparkling. I told her I don't care for sparkling water. Her response was rude, she threw her hands up and said well that's the only thing they have and walked away. While taking my friends drink order she cracked her knuckles. Not very classy for a nice restaurant. We sat for 15 minutes didn't see her again or receive our drinks. Would have liked to have tasted the food but we were so upset about the terrible service we got up and left. Instead we took our business to another restaurant in Scottsdale. An upscale restaurant should be a total experience, they can't just count on the food to keep people returning, service is very important. I won't be giving this place another try."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner.....again. Octopus was fabulous as it was the first time I had it. But the Buratta with almond honey might have taken the cake for the starter which says a lot because I crave the Octopus. The pork Saltimboca was flat out ridiculous. I really thought with a brine and then prosciutto wrap would make it too salty, but it was far from that. It was perfect didn't need anything. The potatoes were unique because They looked like fries sautéed with veg, but the crispy leeks on top added the slight crunchy texture that helped break up the richness of everything else in dish. I'm a huge eater I think they could've dialed back the veg and potato on the dish. My date had the Carbonara. I'm not a fan of it because it's really a romantic dish. Although the ingredients are simple, it's the chef's relationship with the product that makes it amazing. This was one of the most fantastic I've ever tried. Did I like it? No. But the execution was perfect. There was a small but of white wine and very little cream and the egg created layers over and over. It wasn't swimming in sauce and I love that. Again, it was the execution of the dish that made it great. I just don't like carbonara. 
I wasn't excited about the dessert menu but daddy needs his sugar. The affogato was tremendous, but the olive oil shortcake was brilliant. They macerated the strawberries with a touch of brand but it was more complimentary than predominant. But the cake was so incredible and super functional. I could be served with anything. 
My only complaint would be where we sat. We were sat on the patio right next to a table that got sat exactly at the same time as us. They complained about everything and we were subjected to listen to them complain openly about everything, then complain to the server, and when he offered to redo or get them something else, they'd refuse and then sit there and complain again. Keep in mind that we sat at 5:15 and there was nobody else around. I'm happy they are busy, but sitting us next to people simultaneously in an empty restaurant makes it tough to be able to really enjoy your company. We literally were sharing our dining experience with them and their attitude and pettiness was really annoying. 
Next time,  if they sit us next to a table at the same time, I will ask to be sat elsewhere and if the say no again, I will probably leave. But I won't dock them for it because what they are doing is special, but they also need to keep in mind that absolute no opens themselves up to negative reactions."}
{"text":"This was far more than a meal; this was an experience. Actually, this was two meals: we enjoyed ourselves so much we went back two nights later. 

Friday night: very busy, but we hung out at the cocktail pit near the fire until a table was available. Cocktails: a Spice Market and something like \"not your grandma's root beer\" or something like that. Both were very good. Inside, it's rather tight. But I had a great view of the bartender and the kitchen going in the back. Seemed kinda cramped for the staff; dishes stacked up on the bar while tables were cleared, but then the staff all seemed to come together to clear those off quickly. Very happy, positive vibe in the restaurant. 

Started with the octopus, and it was tremendous. I don't know if the whole \"cooked in cork\" thing is real or not, but the octopus was truly an amazing experience. Then we had the rabbit gnocci, which was also amazing. It really was an awesome experience, and the wine we wanted wasn't chilled yet, so Hoke the manager came over and gave us a pour each of something that was ready, while ours chilled. Dessert: pistachio gelato that was out of this world. And I think we also had the chocolate gelato, which was also fab. 

Sunday night: far less busy. Got a table outside. Chilled at the cocktail pit and we had to go find someone to take our order after 15 minutes. Another Spice Market and an Ice Queen. Both were good. Then table outside was great. Started with the pate, which, ethics aside, was phenomenal. And then the black squid ink linguine with prawn. Which was tremendous. And the duck was fab. Espresso was grand, as was the pistachio pudding and I forget which kind of new gelato we tried. Again the wine was excellent. 

Overall, the food and ambiance were amazing, and I now have very, very positive feelings about Scottsdale, in large part based on our experiences at Virtú. We had hear about this place from Clark the gallery guy, and if you meet Clark, give him a high-five for me, since he really nailed it. Both nights the service was excellent, the staff was well-informed, and the ambiance was delightful. My only regret is that I can't give it six stars here. 

I will be visiting Virtú every time I am in Scottsdale from this day forward. And, I am telling everyone about it."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the restaurant or the staff.  The atmosphere, service, and food quality really does not demand the price they are charging.  Drinks are really overpriced as well.

The runner got confused with our orders and yelled at me for confusing the waiter and \"handing \" the plate to the correct person at our table.  The Lamb was delicious.  That was the most noteable portion of the evening."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Virtu with my wife for our date night. Was fantastic and I highly recommend getting reservation on the patio has a great vibe.  It's like an Italy patio with nice lighting and brick floors. Had the pork chop and it was awesome. Great date night place in old town Scottsdale"}
{"text":"First let me say SAVE ROOM FOR DESERT. The butterscotch and chocolate cake are amazing. But it all starts with outstanding cocktails (even the non alcoholic) then starters of Octopus, Burrata and Eggplant that have a unique and well balanced flavor. The Veal Chop was perfect and some of the best Bucatini ever. We are from San Francisco and this place exceeded expectations in food, wine and service for all 8 of us. We'll be back..."}
{"text":"Just went here for the third or fourth time. Has never disappointed! First of all, if you're looking for a date spot this is an excellent choice. I particularly love the outdoor seating area. They have an excellent selection of cocktails with both a list of traditional drinks and some new concoctions. The menu is small but everything I've ever had there was good so it's plenty of choices. The polpo (octopus) is one of their best known dishes. I'm normally hesitant to try octopus because of the texture, but this is delicious! The pastas are made in house. Basically you can't go wrong with your choices. For dessert the chocolate cake is divine! Virtù is definitely on our go to list of restaurants in the valley!"}
{"text":"Three of us had brunch last Sunday. We shared the grilled octopus as an appetizer. The octopus us very tender and served with some greens and a spicy sauce. Our other dishes were good, too. Parking is difficult as they don't have their own lot. The patio is lovely. Service was good. Prices for brunch dishes comparable to other Scottsdale places."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday. Made Esquire's top new restaurants in 2013 list and a James Beard southwest award nominee - had to try it!

Grilled Octopus 5/5 - loved the taste and flavors

Asparagus 5/5 - tender asparagus

Duck 5/5 - so good! Loved the sauce that came with the duck. Skin was crispy and meat was tender. Enjoyed eating the accompanying Brussels sprouts.

Sticky toffee cake with salted caramel gelato
5/5 - WOW! One of the best desserts I've ever had. Apparently they put dates in the cake to keep it moist. Definitely a must try ;)"}
{"text":"Been here on a special romantic date! It's A Michelin Star! Chefs and waiters are very accommodating and professional! The food is scrumdiddlyumptious!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner the other night at Virtu! Our server was amazing and very open and helpful with recommendations. 

Everything we had was incredibly delicious and perfectly prepared:
Octopus appetizer
Duck entrée with foie gras flan
Scallops 

The cocktail I had (can't remember the name, but it was rye whiskey with blueberries and lemon I believe) was also really good

Cant go wrong here. Great food, great service, and great ambiance"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch here today for my birthday I even was adventuresome and tried the octopus and it was absolutely as delicious as the waiter said it was going to be
We had made a reservation under my name and we got there and gave them my husbands name and then got a call asking us why we didn't show up but we told the gal when we got there that we had a reservation so we don't know why there was any confusion 
She checked for a 1230 reservation and acknowledged us so we didn't think there was any problem 
We certainly would never not show up to a fine restaurant - we enjoyed ourselves very much - the food was delicious and the service was good - my husband enjoyed crepes
And the weather was fantastic 
I had a great birthday at the restaurant of my choice and again we will come back - we have been there in the past
We did not appreciate the OpenTable message scolding us about not keeping our reservation when we were there actually 10 minutes early and kept a reservation 
And obviously it was some confusion when we checked in but I think the message that was sent to us was a bit much but that said we will definitely come back - we love that little place and the food"}
{"text":"Hands down bar none one of the best establishments in Scottsdale! Seasonal menus ( if the Branzino is on the menu it's to die for) we have tried everything love the consistency and the Fab wait staff!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute venue, we had lunch al fresco. The service was great; friendly & warm. I enjoyed the grilled cheese with fig -- really hit the spot and a delicious flavor combo. Would be a great place for a date or brunch. Loved the paper towels in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Really nice staff and super delicious food. Needed breakfast to go before they opened, didn't know and walked in, they took my order. Best toast and fruit! This isn't your mommas toast!! Well maybe your mommas but not mine... Wonder bread anyone? Def not! Someone tell me what they do to their raspberries because raspberries I buy never taste like that. Really appreciated the service and the coffee was freshly ground from an espresso machine. Menu looks killer. Will be back for dinner and a bottle of wine soon!!! Interior decor is clean, simple and elegant."}
{"text":"I first tried Virtu for restaurant week a couple years ago and I was so impressed -- great food, amazing service. 

I recommend the bone marrow, the octopus and the wagyu beef -- perfect to share for two. I also recommend coming here for restaurant week, so worth it. 

I did knock one star off because I was a little bit disappointed with my last visit, my entree didn't hit the spot (I couldn't even remember what I ordered lol)

I still love coming here for dinner though. I always sat at the patio, love the vibe, very intimate. Can't wait to come back and try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Overrated... We had dinner last night and was bummed with the service. The food was mediocre and they cook with a lot of butter. I did like the octopus and the spread that came with their bread appetizer. Other than that what was most shocking is how they store their wine... In room temperature. You have to be kidding me when your paying over $100 for a bottle. They need to get it together and stop storing the wine right next to the kitchen on a rack!"}
{"text":"Visited this tucked away gem on a business trip to Scottsdale.  Charming dining room decor and a patio dining area to enjoy a meal al fresco are what greets you along with a friendly staff.

To maximize our visit we ordered 4 entrees to share.  The burrata is surprisingly authentic -- ooey gooey texture just like in Naples and framed by the sweetness of grapes (maybe go a bit lighter on the grapes ... a little goes a long way) and the peppery edge of arugula.  The pepperonata with egg over potatoes had a nice touch of heat just after a big burst of flavor.  The burger was a bit unwieldy -- more like a patty melt on grilled bread rather than a burger \"proper\" -- but the patty was flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium.  The grilled cheese with bacon and mushrooms was a table favorite -- earthy &  smokey flavors made this childhood favorite a bona fide \"grown up\" meal.

This small taste piqued my interest for where dinner menu adventures might take me.  Unfortunately that will have to wait for another visit -- hopefully that will be soon!"}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner here while we visit from out of town. It was a great choice! The Polpo appetizer our waiter recommended was great, so are the Anatra smoked duck entree and the Cappesante seared scallop entree. We also got the chestnut panna cotta seasonal desert because I love both panna cotta and chestnut, but never thought of combining them together. It came with a candle because we noted that it's a birthday dinner. Very happy with it. It was also on the house because of birthday reservation, although they did not tell us in advance. The parking in the area was not bad at all when we got there around 6pm Friday night."}
{"text":"Best brunch I ever had, the ambiance is fabulous and the outdoor space is extremely gorgeous. I helped plan a bridal shower held here and we were very happy with everything. Virtu is not cheap but its well worth every penny you spend. Try their cocktails, you wont be disappointed by any of them!"}
{"text":"This was a beautiful dining experience. The waiter and staff were all very friendly and helpful and provided excellent menu recommendations. 
While the indoor seating was crowded, the outdoor seating was very relaxing and charming. 
The octopus was some of the best Ive ever had. It was tender and flavorful with just the right amount of heat. The burrata was super creamy with sweetness from blackberries and amazing grilled, smokey bread. We had the pappardelle and bucatini pastas which were both amazing. The pappardelle was savory and salty with a great rustic style. The bucatini was spicy and delicious as well. For desserts, the chocolate chip gelato tasted fresh. The chocolate cake dessert was so delicious with a soft, warm center topped with fresh gelato. 
Definitely plan to come back when we are in Scottsdale/Phoenix area again."}
{"text":"The hamburger for brunch could be the best burger I have ever had!! 

All the food is so good.  Service and atmosphere is great!!"}
{"text":"Best meal in AZ, hands down. Appetizers, pasta course, main courses, dessert, after-dinner drinks... everything was perfect, not a single miss. Service was beyond phenomenal (thank you, Ivan!), and the place has a wonderful romantic ambiance. The grilled octopus needs to be on every foodie's bucket list. The handmade bucatini was a revelation. Duck and scallops were cooked and presented flawlessly. Toffee cake was to die for. You get the idea. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to go this restaurant for the first time to celebrate a birthday. We normally don't take the time to write a review, however, in this case the food and the service were so outstanding that taking a few minutes to write this is worth it. Our server, Stacey, exemplified an over achieving level of service which from the moment we sat down we felt welcomed and comfortable. She really let us explore the menu and reviewed all the needed to be known of both the food and the chef. On the other hand, the food was excellent. From appetizer to dessert all choices were very detailed and explained by Stacey and matched precisely to what she explained and what we expected. We highly recommend this restaurant. We are excited to go back to see the changes they are implementing to the restaurant. Loved the food loved the restaurant and LOVED Stacey!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is such a wonderful hidden gem. It is a favorite of mine and my mom's. They have amazing cocktails, my favorite is the Ice Queen. And the most delicious appetizer of asparagus with duck egg and candied bacon.  Soooo good. Their menu changes with the seasons but these two favorites are usually there. A romantic places for special occasions as well and beautiful tranquil outdoor dining. Book early to get in."}
{"text":"This was my top choice for Restaurant Week, and it turned out to be the right one. I came here for a girls night with reservations for 4. We were seated outside on the patio at the community table, which was surrounded by lanterns, strung lights, and trees, which made for a very relaxing ambiance. Our server George was very personable, and great at explaining how their drinks were handcrafted, as well as how the food was prepared. 

I started off with the Fountain of Youth cocktail, the description of tequila, bell pepper syrup and siracha bitters peaked my curiosity. I asked the server about it, as I was a little apprehensive that I wouldn't like it, he said it I didn't like it I could just send it back. Well since there was no risk involved, I decided to go for it, and was glad I did. It was fantastic, slightly sweet with a minute undertone of the rooster sauce. One of the best cocktails I've ever had.

My friend and I decided to order different things from the prix fix menu and share so we could sample as much as possible. For the first course we ordered the Chef Starter which was a crostini with manchego, croquette, and roasted pepper, everything on the plate was enjoyable. We also ordered the salad with goat cheese, candied nuts, and beets, which was also fantastic. For our entrees we chose the flat iron steak which was cooked perfectly over a flavorful polenta, and the European seabass which had a sweet and savory sauce, both were amazing! Finally for dessert: chocolate mousse and marscapone ice cream. The chocolate mousse was very rich and fluffy and came with a chocolate truffle, and a fried donut, and the mascarpone ice cream was rich and delightful. 

The only downside to our meal was that everything was served at a very slow pace. I was kind of expecting it since they were so busy, and it was restaurant week. Our server checked in with us many times to let us know what was going on, but it would've have been nicer if they were better prepared for the volume of customers. I will still definitely return without the restaurant week price, as the food, drinks, and service were awesome."}
{"text":"I don't know which to consider the best part of a Virtù Honest Craft dining experience, the service or the food.  Both are 5-star, no doubt.  My wife's and my last visit Ivan was our server.  Like all the servers he is great.  I could go on about all the food items like the Charred Octopus (called Polpo on the menu), the Buratta, or the Pork Rib Chop...but I would be saying much the same as all the other 5-star posters (sans the recent east coast moaning, which sounded like a difficult to satisfy perpetual pouty-puss to me or someone who prefers chain-food...do us a favor and stay home).

PS: Ivan informed us Virtù will be expanding/enhancing their outside dining area in addition to some new things for their associated bed and breakfast called The Bespoke Inn."}
{"text":"A nice set up combination or indoor and outdoor seating.  The patio was very comfortable and the service was excellent.  It was AZ restaurant week so we chose the fish combinations.  The kale salad was great and the foie gras was among the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, easily comparing to restaurants twice the price. Entree average is about $30/plate. Service was good, but nothing special. This place is still a great value proposition."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I have been wanting to try this restaurant for ages and we finally got it on our schedules to meet up with some good friends. The service was impeccable. The waitress was so knowledgeable and helpful. We ordered 3 starters: the octopus, asparagus, and house cheese board. They were all so delicious we nearly licked the plates clean. Our entrees were the duck, the scallops, and the fish. All so incredibly flavorful. It has only been a day and I'm dying to go back!"}
{"text":"I honestly have SO many great things to say about Virtu. It is literally one of my favorite 'foodie' places in the Valley, a James Beard Foundation Award Nominee, and a place that I ALWAYS tell people to go to because I know that they will not be disappointed. It is truly a hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale. From their amazing craft cocktails to their homemade pasta and insanely delicious/creative dishes, this place is a grand slam. They've literally got it all. 

We went here for Easter Brunch and it was the best decision. My family was blown away with the atmosphere (love the rosemary and twine place settings), service, and creativity of the menu. We left with huge grins on our face! 

I ordered the Virtu G+T (Their spin on a gin and tonic with thyme!). It is SO refreshing, I could drink it at any time of the day! I then ordered the simple salad which was light and perfect; the tomatoes were SO sweet and the lemon oregano dressing was tart and fab. For my main, I ordered the pork ragu that was served over creamy mascarpone polenta, fried eggs, salsa verde, and grilled toast. The polenta was so rich and seriously fantastic. I'm usually not the biggest polenta fan but this was not like your ordinary polenta (think mac & cheese GOOD). For dessert, we split their sticky chocolate toffee cake topped with salted caramel gelato (I have no words!), doughnuts with honey, and their butterscotch pudding. 

This review is making me hungry, I want to do it all over again! Seriously, go HERE! You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Meh. We ordered six dishes out of the fifteen offered on the menu. My beet salad was bone dry, could not choke it down, had to ask for dressing. The tuna was bland. The pasta was tasteless, well tasted like an open can of tomato paste, the short rib was tender, but simply meat, nothing special. On the plus side the rabbit gnocchi was tasty and so was the asparagus dish. Two glasses of okay wine and three cocktails. With tip it was $250."}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday for brunch and we had a reservation. The ambience was great and it felt like we weren't in Scottsdale anymore. I'm from Seattle so it reminded me of home. The food is great; menu changes with what's available.  The service was awesome, my water glass was never empty and neither was my coffee."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place.  My husband and I have come a couple of times.  We usually don't plan, so we don't mind sitting at the bar.  It is fun to see all the action there.  The first time I had the Amante Appasionato, super delicious drink, I don't remember what we had to eat because it was a while ago and most of their menu seems to change a bit.  This last time I had the scallops, they were perfectly cooked and the sauce with the bacon made for a scrumptious bite.  My husband had the charred octopus, this is one of their signature dishes and I can understand why.  This is the best octopus I've ever had.  It was not chewy at all, tender with a nice smoky taste, delicious.  I had a couple of cocktails, one was off the menu, a version of the Ice Queen but with gin instead of vodka, really great.  How could I forget to mention the dessert, oh my, this chocolate toffee cake with mascarpone ice cream was to die for.  I could have liked the plate.  The place is small inside, so if you want a table, better make reservations.  They have a nice patio, but on cold nights I think they keep it close.  I am a definite fan, I want to come sometime for brunch, the menu look"}
{"text":"Amazing! Octupus is the bomb and seating outside is limited so call ahead for a reservation or grab a seat at the bar. Full menu and wonderful view of kitchen."}
{"text":"This is one of the BEST restaurants in town!  The food is outstanding. I grew up in France and know a little bit about food...Italian chef and owner Gio Osso is truly talented and understands exactly how a gourmet experience is executed. Brought friends and family, always a success. Squid ink linguine to die for..."}
{"text":"Delicious food that is only surpassed by the amazing cocktails.  I appreciate a restaurant with a smaller menu -- I rather have them do a few things really well than try and do a lot of things ok.  Between everyone in our group we tried just about everything on the menu and there were no complaints only compliments.  

It's a bit hard to find, but you will be impressed once you do."}
{"text":"I said I'd never, ever in a million years go back to Arizona, until Virtu. And, still, I'd only go back to dine and dash from the state as quickly as possible. Anyway, Virtu is incredible. We happened to stumble upon it during restaurant week. We ordered 2 of everything on the menu, and there wasn't one dish I wouldn't order again. It has a farm to table vibe; small, lite, quaint, and classy. We each ordered a crafted cocktail - I had the Ice Queen, which was great. Fruity. There was a Moscow Mule-esque drink that was fantastic. I think that my favorite dishes were the honey beets, there was a fish entree that was incredible, and the brandzino (unnnnnnnnnreal). I almost ready to book a flight back right now..."}
{"text":"We stopped by for brunch on a Saturday.  We were the only ones in the place at 10:30 but when we left there was a nice crowd in there.  I had Lemon Ricotta Pancakes which were incredible, the pistachio cream was an interesting and delicious topping.  I couldn't finish both pancakes, but I wanted to!  My husband had the frittata; he said the sausage in it was superb.  Even though we were stuffed, we waited a bit so we could try dessert.  The butterscotch budino was amazing.  We also tried the Lemoncello which was refreshing and not too sweet.  It was expensive (two champagnes, two meals, dessert & apertif were over $70) but worth the price for something special.  Wait staff was very attentive; hostess was very nice."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and met some friends here for dinner. Quaint little place in Scottsdale. Mostly patio seating with heaters which provided plenty of heat during our meal. My question is, where has Burrata been all my life? Seriously, this starter was amazing and I'm going to order it wherever they have it next time in the future!  Amazing!  I had the bucatini pasta which was ok but not a huge wow factor. The guys split a prime rib and my BF said it was the most amazing cut of Prime Rib he's ever had!  Seriously, it will feed a party of 3-4 people. Our friends have dined here before and said the menu changes frequently but they do keep favorites on there too.  Nice to know that each time you dine here, the experience will be different on your palate.  Lovely place, we'll visit again!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the drinks more than the food.  Cocktails were spectacular!
The food wasn't bad, just meh. We had appetizers only.  Clams, Burrata, Croquette, Deviled Eggs."}
{"text":"We stumbled in during lunch/brunch and are so happy we did. Everything was top notch...service, food, and drinks. Enjoyed every bite for sure!"}
{"text":"We eat at many wonderful places for work dinners in several cities but this was bar none, the best experience and meal we have had. Courtney guided us through an incredible evening of the finest of everything. Looking forward to returning on my next trip out."}
{"text":"The impossible is accomplished here. 
The brunch menu pork ragu with egg is a must! 
Also chistorria with egg.  It sounds like too much embryonic poultry, but it works. 
Hoke led us thru the culinary delight with a wry smile. 
Local foodies beware, this would take up an entire culinary day of my week, if I lived here. 
If there is no Michelin star Gio Osso, then it's fixed."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best restaurants you can visit in the Phoenix area.  Come with a group of 3-4 people and share a few appetizers and main courses, you can't go wrong!  Grilled octopus (pulpo), asparagus with duck egg, crudo, pork chop, duck breast, sword fish, butterscotch budino, chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream, wonderful wine and cocktail list!  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I now see why this restaurant has so many awesome reviews and is highly ranked. This was only my second time dining in Scottsdale, but I can't help feeling every other place will be a let down. 

Location is a little off-beat, so if you are looking to people watch or watch the cars drive-by while you eat outside you'll be disappointed. Upside, it makes for a perfect and pleasant spot for a quiet night out for dining. 

We dined on a very cool evening and were concerned an outside table would not be a good option, but the hostess assured us the space heaters would suffice and she was very correct. Heaters at every table and we asked to have ours knocked down a bit after the wind died off.  

Do beware, as I've seen a few reviews related, majority of their seating is outdoors. If you do have a reservation, plan on most likely sitting outside, and if you hit one of those few AZ rainy evenings, be prepared to have a call concerning cancellation. We lucked out, night before was a killer storm. Server stated they had to cancel a ton of reservations. That aside, DO eat outside, the inside seemed a bit noisy once the place was full while the patio remained a much better place to hold a conversation. 

Staff... very professional, but at the same time quite friendly. Nathan our server took a lot of time with the menu and was very knowledgeable when my wife's vegan questions came into play. When asked about wine suggestions, didn't jump to the ridiculous price section and suggested a few that went well with some of the main dishes we were thinking. Even got a few jokes in there when the gelato fell off the top of the chocolate cake (which they were seriously willing to redo). 

Food... superb. Starters are sizable enough where we could have probably done 2 for a table of 4, but we all wanted something different so went for it. Preparation and seasoning spot on from start to finish. Accommodating to my vegan wife (almost dessert still gets her), beyond the usual pasta and veg option. I did a Buratta starter and Short Rib main. Both excellent, the Short Ribs were like butter. The brussel sprouts, which I'm not the biggest fan, I killed and had to ask about the preparation so I could try to reproduce at home. 

Wife had the sticky toffee cake, and OMG, GET IT!!! I wish I could type 4 letter words to say how good that was. Only other dessert I will remember more is our wedding cake. 

Definitely return."}
{"text":"Starting at the bar..awesome drink concoctions.  The ice Queen was dreamy.   Beautiful setting and nice vibe.

We ordered the barrata app which had prosciutto and a delicious sausage.  Yum.  Here is my only complaint.  I asked the waiter \"scallops or rib eye'. He said oh Rib eye!  And my husband ordered the pork chop.  Well the rib I ordered a tad over medium arrived medium rare so back it went..but what pissed me off is that the waiter didn't mention...this was 40 ounces!  Come on that is a ridiculous amount of beef and he should have said this is a huge amount you need to split.  But no, the dingbat didn't bother.   Lame.   Otherwise delicious"}
{"text":"Just had our first visit to this hidden gem! Everything was absolutely perfect, the asparagus appetizer with the egg on top, scallops over gnocchi and the panna cotta were to die for! I felt like we were on a vacation, the atmosphere was simply stunning, we sat outside under a tree and enjoyed every moment of our meal. We will all be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful! My fiancé chose this place for my birthday dinner and it was an amazing choice! We loved the food and cocktails! Our waiter was super friendly and very very knowledgeable about the food and beverages. We absolutely loved the octopus scallop and the chicken. The outside sitting is wonderful as well and so romantic and lovely! We loved everything about here and we would absolutely come back again and again."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch, lovely space, outdoor patio with ample shade and sun options.  Pet friendly patio ++ which is a great perk.

Menu choice was small but wide range of options to serve most tastes, had the French toast - highly recommend, with cinnamon pears, toffee drizzle and marscapone on top, tres delicious.

Popular spot, made same day reso just incase and I would recommend same."}
{"text":"Virtu is a small American restaurant that offers an intimate dining experience. The interior seats around twenty people. Let's see what the fire marshal says. I came with colleagues, but it felt like I should have brought a date.
 
Virtu has an semi-open kitchen (no idea if that's official terminology). I guess that doesn't tell you much (Waffle House has a very open kitchen, right?), but given how pricey Virtu is, you can begin to imagine the chef, server, patron dynamic.
 
The kale salad came with too much dressing. I hate to put it this way, but if you look at the picture, you'll see that the dressing resembled your seven year old nephew applying chocolate syrup to a bowl of ice cream.
 
The menu didn't have any vegetarian entrees, but the chef was willing to whip up a quinoa and Brussels sprout dish. It was artfully presented, and had hints of pickled vegetables that worked surprisingly well. If I return, I'll have to show them the picture and let them know they have a winner.
 
I'd return for a special occasion or if invited. In the meantime, I'll make sure \"allows you to regularly eat at classy establishments without feeling uncomfortable social pressure\" falls on the pro side of the pro-con list of having a significant other."}
{"text":"I have been here twice - once for dinner and once for brunch, which they serve everyday. This place is phenomenal! They have delicious and unique cocktails - I had an earthy beet one at dinner and an orange one with egg whites at brunch that tasted like an Orange Julius. You must try something different off the cocktail menu.  
At brunch, their crepes or a different take on a Benedict is a must have. The crepe is huge! We had one stuffed with ham and topped with a poached egg - heavenly!
For dinner, the grilled octopus is incredible. Believe me, I was never going to eat octopus in my life. Until I saw this on a friend's plate and begged for a bite. Too many of the appetizers sounded good, so I just had 2 of those and no entree. The arincini were really good, but the asparagus with the poached egg, feta and candied bacon was literally the most delicious thing I have ever eaten!!
The affogato was the perfect ending - not too heavy or overly sweet. 
Okay, I gotta go get dressed and go back right now and try another cocktail and something else amazing off the ever changing menu..."}
{"text":"Virtu exceeds every expectation.  Intimate atmosphere and beautiful ambiance.  The craft cocktails are incredible.   We had the strawberry vodka foam pepper cocktail which was made just right... not to sweet and very satisfying.  Then we had the asparagus with sunny side up egg with feta cheese and honey cured bacon that was the best representation of this dish we have ever tasted.   I had the sausage  meatball starter that was amazing and my date had the Crudo appetizer that was like a cerviche but even better.    The scallop entree was perfectly done and the flat iron beef with an amazing rub and sauce couldn't have been better.  The affogato for desert was a perfect end to the most incredible meal.  Service was very professional and prices reasonable for a world class Michelin type meal.   This meal cannot be topped in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"We came here because it had 200 reviews and 4 1/2 stars for dessert only, but what we found was what we believe will be a superior dining experience in a quaint lil Bistro that you would find in Italy's rustic region. We had #1 &#3 on desert menu. One word to describe these two desserts, BOOM! Yes BOOM! In only a superior way. We will be coming back for diner before we head back to the East Coast."}
{"text":"Took my wife here to celebrate our third anniversary, happy to say that it was amazing! Let me start out by saying, don't make the mistake I did and not make a reservation. We ended up waiting for a bit to get a table but again they were pretty busy and it was my fault not making a reservation before hand. 

We spent the time waiting at the bar and had a few drinks, the bartender that was working that night was great. Had some great conversations and was really helpful in suggesting a few tasty drinks.

Once we were seated we decided to try their signature appetizer the octopus with Calabria chili butter.  And we were blown away! I can understand why that is what they are known for, because it was delicious to the last bite and almost had me licking the plate... but my wife wouldn't let me.

Our main dishes were Maiale which I order because the pork rib chop caught my eye.and she ordered Bucanti which I got a bite of and the goose egg was a nice touch. We enjoyed every bite!

Unfortunately we were both so full that we skipped dessert. But that just gives us another reason so go again to taste some of the options they ha e for that 

All in all, it was a great night made special by the staff and Virtù. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Beautiful dining room hidden in Old Town Scottsdale.  We made a reservation and scored an outdoor table on a lovely May evening.  It was the perfect night to sit outside and enjoy an amazing meal.  My husband and I shared the grilled octopus to start - fresh, flavorful and inventive.  I tried the duck for my entree and it was perfectly prepared...a little sweet with the cherry demi and a little savory with the mushrooms and kale.  This place is a must stop on your culinary tour of the Valley."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and sat on the patio. Super nice atmosphere, relaxing, and inviting. The menu offers a good variety for \"foodies,\" with delicious savory and sweet options. 

French toast (with toffee syrup, cinnamon soaked pears, mascarpone) - Delicious, we did this kind of as a brunch appetizer to share with the table, which was a nice way to get a little bite of sweetness without doing it as a full entree

Grilled cheese (with prosciutto, fig jam, fried egg) - This was heaven! All the flavors perfectly complimented each other. It is served with a nice arugula salad, which I threw into the sandwich as well. Will definitely get this again! 

Pork ragu (over marscapone polenta, fried egg, salsa verde) - Exceptional, very hearty dish, tremendous flavors and beautifully presented. Top notch. 

Can't wait to come back here! We regret not getting to try dinner here, as I am sure it would have been equally memorable and delicious."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and did some research online looking for a good place to try, that we hadn't been to during our previous trips to Scottsdale, and this one did not disappoint.  Amazing food and service!  We'd highly recommend the Grilled Octopus and Grilled Asparagus starters."}
{"text":"4.5 Food

Restaurant floor run by amateurs.

Real noisy if you're stuck inside.

but I'll keep going back....yum !"}
{"text":"Very good service.  Tea was excellent.  We had three different entrées all of which were really good. I'd say it's worth the trip"}
{"text":"Having been to the most foodies cities in the States - New York, New Orleans, Denver, Los Angeles, San Fransico, etc - this is the best restaurant in Phoenix.  We go every visit to town."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Virtu and finally did with my cousins today for brunch.  Walking up, you can't miss the outside patio with a nice ambiance.  It was a beautiful day, so we sat outside - unfortunately it got warm fast, so we moved inside.  Started with a Enza | Prosecco and a Apple cocktail from the drink list - which was perfectly made.  We ordered the berry parfait to start and it was okay - but, it was enough to share.  I ordered the frittate di pasta and they were kind enough to make it vegetarian, it came with a cup of fruit.  My cousin ordered the classic crepe and when it arrived, it was HUGE.  My other cousin ordered the smoked duck and she loved it!  So why only 3 stars?  I didn't enjoy my dish and my cousin didn't enjoy the crepe.  The skillet was pipping HOT, the food never cooled down, it just continued to release steam with each bite.  It was too bland and wouldn't order it again.  I left hunger unfortunately.  The crepe had a ton of ham, so if you like pork, this dish is for you.  Maybe dinner offers a better selection."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, service and food! Took my fiancé here for her birthday dinner and it exceeded expectation! Scallops and burrata were amazing"}
{"text":"We really don't visit this place enough, but we absolutely should! It's outstanding and will take your taste buds on the very best kind of adventure. Starting with the Charred Octopus and the Panzanella, but the real treat is the craft of the plate, or entrées if you will. Now like most crafty restaurants, they will change their menu regularly, so I have not been since their new additions, but when we went, we had a pork Tomahawk that was unreal, and I wish I knew more about it. Otherwise, they do now feature a Bistecca Tagliata, a Niman Prime Tomahawk for two, I need to try this."}
{"text":"It waa OK. I love the creative meal choices and hand crafted cocktail, all are great and very original. 

Been there once and felt like it is more of a bucket list dinning experience rather a place I'd want to go back to again."}
{"text":"Holy toledo! This place is AMAZING! My mother-in-law and I shared the grilled octopus and grilled cheese with fig jam. I literally have been craving this food since the day I left. I had never had octopus and what am delicious experience it was. It was grilled to be crispy and not chewy or fishy tasting at all. I was in heaven! Their grilled cheese is the BEST I have ever had in my 30 years of life. They top a thick crisp bread with a special cheese and fig jam. It will literally melt in your mouth; absolutely fantastic! Also, their iced tea has a unique taste which I loved. The outdoor seating is so adorable and peaceful. The staff is very friendly and provide excellent service. I just love Virtue and plan to go back many, many, many times!"}
{"text":"Good to see Gio's got his own place. Good cocktails w/ artisan spirits. Good burger on lunch menu. Small and you may need to get a reservation nowadays."}
{"text":"I was surprised that I never visited this place earlier.  I consider myself somewhat of a foodie, and love to try the unique quaint restaurants.  We came later in the evening and they were very accommodating with the seating.  The food & drinks were superb and even the table next to us were extremely friendly.  I can't wait to go back so I can update with specifics. :)"}
{"text":"Due to our restaurant research we made this our first stop when coming into Phoenix on a Sunday. They open up early at 10 am for brunch, and the brunch menu is pretty diverse. I went for the octopus, which was delicious, but not a huge portion of you tend to like more substantial meals. The Amante Appassionato was an AMAZING brunch cocktail and the ambiance here is simply beautiful. From the Individual Rosemary twigs to the doors that open onto the huge and beautiful patio, I would definitely recommend coming here for a beautiful meal."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Virtu for his birthday brunch. I made reservations via OpenTable and noted that we're celebrating a birthday. We were seated quickly when we arrived. I ordered the Ice Queen and he ordered the Fortified Truth. Both were beautifully presented. As for food, I ordered the Grilled Octopus - it was a little on the salty side for me but it was still pretty good. My friend ordered the Pork Ragu which had a sunny side up egg which was delicious! 

Since it was his birthday, they gave us a complimentary dessert... we ordered the chocolate cake with ice cream on top. I don't remember the name of it but it's made with dates which was actually too sweet and the scoop of ice cream could be a tad bigger. 

Serve was quick and attentive. I would definitely come back to try some of their other cocktails/food options!"}
{"text":"Went last night, a Friday night.   Reservations are a smart thing to do because the place is busy and popular.   The food and vibe were both fantastic.   Charred Octo is a must-try.  I had the pork flat iron, which was great.   This was also a Restaurant Week menu.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food, service, staff and the patio is beautiful! The grilled octopus is delicious!"}
{"text":"Place is legit. 
Took wife for a rare night out.
Sat outside on the patio, service was great.
We split a bottle of wine and noshed on the burrita appetizer (done very well!) Wish we could have had a coupke crusty bread slices to finish off the Concord grape jam.

She had the white chocolate scallops, I had the orata  (bream) fish. Both cooked perfectly.  The scallops were probably the best of the 2 dishes, like A++ and A+

We spilt the budino dessert, nice presentation and flavor off the chart! Again, maybe I'm weird but would have loved sonething to dip in it... just me.

Then we walked to the rusty spur for some drinks and a uber home. Fun night

Great spot, going back soon as my wife and I can"}
{"text":"A huge thank you to Virtu for making our Anniversary dinner one to truly remember during restaurant week.  The staff was friendly and accomodated our every wish - from the fun and friendly banter with the bartenders to the great suggestions from our servers.  Chef Gio Osso and his kitchen was on point continuing to put out satisfying dish after dish and the bartenders great drinks.  We could not have asked for a more spetacular dinner.  Amoung the dishes we enjoyed included the crispy kale salad and sausage polpette followed by grilled aparagus, charred octopus accompaning our butterfish, and grilled pork rib chop dinners.  The peaches and cream panacotta and chocolate peanut butter cup deserts were fabulous finish out our meal.  Chef Osso and Virtu provided us with one of our best meals in Phoenix ever.  This hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale is definately not a place to overlook and one to experience.  We cannot wait to come back and explore the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I came with some friends for brunch, and had an ok experience. Everyone said their food was average. Drinks were good, we especially liked the passion fizz"}
{"text":"Virtu is a very small restaurant that has won and been nominated for many awards. The daily changing menu is described as contemporary European with an Italian slant. You will be seated on the patio unless you specify to be indoors in your reservation. They are without a parking lot but you can park nearby with street parking or the lot that is basically across the street.

We were seated on the patio in the 93 degree heat at a wobbly table. Our waiter was able to fix the table but we were slightly uncomfortable in the heat.

We started with cocktails that were creative, interesting and contained ingredients I never heard of. The cocktails also tasted great BTW.

Our appetizers were Sicilian Rope Sausage and a salad. My salad was made of fresh micro greens, citrus and hazelnuts and contained a disk of goat cheese blended with beetroot. It was good but could have used a crouton or slice of bread to spread the cheese on. My husband said the rope sausage was good but the peppers and onions were a bit greasy.

For dinner I tried the Big Eye Tuna. The tuna was prepared reasonably well and was served as is over fried sun chokes in a sweet sauce. The sauce was suppose to be an agro dolce but I didn't get any sour just sweet.......It was cloyingly sweet but did have a sprinkle of sea salt and some Calabrian chili. I should have asked for a lemon to fix it but I wondered if it was just me so I asked my husband to try it and he said, \"I can't eat that..blah blah blah\"...I'm thinking I have more room for dessert now!

For dessert I had the Peaches and Cream Olive Oil Cake. Honestly after the sun chokes the dessert didn't seem sweet at all to me....

Didn't hit it out of the park for me this time.................maybe next time?"}
{"text":"Ate here last weekend for restaurant week. Overall, great meal. Honestly I think this should be about a 4.5 star place (yelp gets it right) but they try hard and put out some great food. We came with a group and ordered one of all the apps (loved the burratta) and we shared a bunch of entrees. Stand out we're the octopus and the brandzino. 

The cocktails I had (something that tasted like an old fashion with a bit extra cherry) was so good I had to drink 4 of them.

Only downside at all was one plate that we sent back (the panzenella) because the bread in the dish was so hard it could have broken teeth. They replaced it quickly and it was delicious. Can't wait to go back to try the full menu."}
{"text":"Wow! The chocolate sticky toffee pudding is TO DIE FOR! I also recommend the asparagus appetizer and the fries that come with the mussels are potentially the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place on Yelp!  I went with the octopus since I read such great reviews about it.  It lived up to it's reputation. I am huge fan of octopus and normally order it when I see it on the menu.  This was actually a very generous portion for the price.  I am from LA, though. It came with a nice and simple arugula salad.  
For my entree, I ordered the scallops.  I'm so glad that I did!  They were perfectly cooked.  They were topped with nuts of some sort,which I normally don't like, but in this case adored.

My drinks were delicious as well, aromatic! The bartender whipped something up for me when I asked his to make me a drink with St. Germain's.  I love the smell of citrus rind.

I sat at the bar by myself.  The bartenders were extremely attentive and friendly.  They gave great recommendations!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We've been here twice already and will be coming back. We've sat on the patio both times, which even in the winter at night is fine because they have great heat lamps and blankets.

The first time was just for cocktails - and they were delicious. The second time we got wine, a small plate, and dinner. The wine list is great. We got the asparagus small plate which was to die for. The way the over easy duck egg mixed with the hollandaise sauce was amazing. We both got the squid ink pasta for dinner and it was perfection. I haven't been able to find that dish outside of Venice, Italy so we were so excited to try it. It did not disappoint. Love this cute little place!"}
{"text":"Wow. Truly amazing food. From the entrees (duck was amazing) to the dessert (sticky toffee cake was delectable)...and cocktails in between, truly a spot for all foodies to check out."}
{"text":"Great little place located in downtown Scottsdale. It's a nice, intimate space with some very interesting dishes.

We ordered the grilled octopus, the Scallops, and the smoked duck breast. Followed up with the chocolate toffee for desert. Washed things down with a Malbec and a red from Chave Rhone.

Servers were very friendly and I liked the layout of the place. Definitely worth your time when visiting the Phoenix/Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant that is worth a visit. The inside is quite small, so sitting outside may be a better bet. The outside patio looked gorgeous with its romantic lighting draping over the surroundings. But it was a little hot outside so I stuck with a small table inside. I ordered a few items, even though I could have ordered the whole menu with my appetite. I started off with the octopus. Although its criminal with how little they give you, it was still delicious. The addition of chickpeas is a nice contrast in texture. The sauce is plate licking good.  The local spring salad was great but it wasn't anything that was amazing. Still, the goat cheese and prosciutto create a great french feel, with the cheese board and salad colliding into one The duck entree was worth the visit. The duck being moist and tender was only the tip of this voyage of a meal. The flavors were so orgasmic! The dancing juxtaposition of sweet and savory pair so well like two veteran tango dancers. The fresh ingredients only elevate the meal even further. Every bite was wonderful, and I purposely slowed down to enjoy every morsel. Im quite excited for what this place has to offer. I hope this place stays for quite some time."}
{"text":"A Manhattan cocktail typically has three ingredients. Virtu's has about thirty. 
The list of ingredients read like a mystery novel, where the next ingredient was even more curious than the previous. I tried one out of pure, morbid curiosity.
I was richly rewarded for the decision.
There were so many flavors in this cocktail, my taste buds practically overdosed.

Virtu also features Menabrea beer, or more specifically, Menabrea Amber. If you've never had one, I strongly recommend it. This hard to find Italian IPA will pair beautifully with any meal, as if it was a fine wine. It's that good.

From the appetizers to desert, Virtu was delightful. The service, even better, making this restaurant every bit of five stars.

Grilled octopus, Branzino, and a custard-like desert were chart toppers. 

I read some reviewers complain about the wine list being too abbreviated, the prices too high, and the meal selections limited.
These are people who should not be Yelping since they're all very clearly full 'o shit.

Virtu is one of the few restaurants where the price is truly on par with the food.
The service, adorns the food and drink experience like an expensive fashion accessory.
And the ambiance whisks you away to Tuscany for the ninety minutes you're there.

I wasn't going to do this, write a review this favorable for fear I'll never get a seat again, but that would be wrong.
Virtu deserves every accolade it gets. They've earned it. 

At least me and the James Beard nomination committee think so anyway."}
{"text":"Chef Gio's flagship spot has long been on my list.  With each passing month I didn't visit my expectations were ratcheted up. When I did finally make my visit I left satisfied but not necessarily blown away.  The octupus was very tender but the chile butter hardly impacted the flavor. The ends were also too charred to really enjoy. The carbonara was excellent but a little too dense and heavy for my preference.  Wasn't a huge fan of their interpretation of the short ribs.

All in all a very good experience.  I just guess that I allowed all of the hype to push my expectations into unrealistic levels."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Bespoke Inn, and enjoyed the food at Virtu enough to try brunch and dinner.  Hubby had the lamb burger (excellent!), I had the scallops one night (very good), our friend had the duck which disappeared.  I wish I had been hungry enough for dessert - next time!

Tip: book ahead for a table on the patio - it's lovely in the evening."}
{"text":"Man, we really wanted to like this spot!  Went last night for V-day, had prix fixe menu which always worries me but the reviews for this place are so good we had to try it.  Well, the atmosphere is great, nice and cozy...but they rushed us to order all the courses which started things off on a bad foot.  When celebrating an occasion, or paying good money for a meal, I'd prefer to take a little time to enjoy.  Our server actually said she wasn't allowed to put our first course in before we'd decided and ordered all of our courses.  We expressed concern but went along with the program.  Both of our first courses then came out cold, which seemed to indicate that they had the items just waiting to go out, which is the concern with prix fixe in the first place.  We decided to cut our losses at this point and told them we were leaving...their response, \"we're not for everybody.\"  Ok...guess you aren't, thanks!"}
{"text":"YES to everything about this place. Had a drink similar to a boulevardier - I think it's called Amaro Vitale - amazing drink and we each had 3 :). Also had the octopus and burrata and both were delicious!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Virtu. The manager Joshua was proactive about calling ahead to inform me of the patio reservation being during a time of the day that the outside temperature would still be almost unbearable. He accommodated us and took really good care of us. 

Wesley was our server and he did a phenomenal job at walking us through menu and making wonderful recommendations. We ordered the scallops and duck; it was superb.  I'm looking forward to trying the pork chop and chicken dishes on our next visit.

The ambiance was very romantic and set the tone for our date night. I highly recommend Virtu Honest Craft for those looking to spend some amazing quality time with a significant other or small group of friends. The food will not disappoint you! TRY THE DESSERTS! They were DELICIOUS! 

Thank you for the amazing first time experience, we will be back and will be recommending your restaurant to family and friends."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place one star (it'd be a lie) just to keep people from wanting to come here, that way I'd have it all to myself.  This place is truly a gem.  Food was interesting and delicious.  Service was impeccable.  Good job virtu!"}
{"text":"Tried them out during  restaurant week.  Food was decent, but the business practice was shady beyond anything I've experienced in past.  One drink (tequila + soda) = $27.50.   What makes this crazy is the actual drink was $22 and the ice in the drink was $5.50.  Manager tells me \"you get more with the ice\".  I guess shame on me for not asking if ice in the drink would make it more expensive.  Never again."}
{"text":"Went back for dinner as I said in my previous review.  Still loved it.  Fantastic food.  Clint made us a couple of cocktails at the bar, great as they were before.  Chris was our server and Geo is the chef.  They fly in scallops that are alive in the shell.  They taste completely different than typical scallops you would order at other restaurants.  Very fresh and flavorful with a nice presentation.  Actually had two of those.  The octopus app was outstanding.  Never had octopus that was that tender.  The papardelle and elk entrees were unbelievable as well.  Everything had a beautiful presentation but most importantly tasted great.  Can't remember the name of the dessert but it was basically vanilla ice cream in a coffee cup with espresso poured over the top.  Interesting, really liked it.  Had a couple of glasses of wine to boot.  It's a cool little place with a nice, yet casual, atmosphere.  It will definitely be incorporated into our rounds of typical places we frequent.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Lovely birthday lunch. Started with martinis...small but potent.  Ordered fig salad, savory crepe and grilled octopus.  Salad was perfect, tender spinach, grape dressing, dried figs and cheese...fruity, slightly sweet, nice fig chew and tangy cheese.  The crepe was thin, tender, with prosciutto ham, Swiss and topped with delicate béchamel.  While grilled octopus had a flavorful bite, it was just a little overcooked along edges, but just right in larger pieces.  Accompanying chickpeas were addictive and spicy.

The Nebbiolo Rose was a revelation...perfect for a hot day with lots of fruit and a floral nose.  The crowning glory was the chocolate toffee cake and ice cream dessert  topped with a candle and complemented with cappuccino..  We devoured it and agreed that it was one of the best desserts we have ever had!."}
{"text":"This dining experience was truly the best I've had in Arizona. Made a reservation for my girlfriend and I and we were blown away by the food as well as the ambiance of this hidden spot. I say hidden because I've lived in the old town area for over 3 years and never knew it was there.

It's a place that allows you to feel like your in another world but right here in the desert. The lay out of the patio is really nice & quaint, with large olive trees, fresh lavender growing in nearby flower beds, and a fresh airy mood that any patio-goer would enjoy! 

Getting to the food, we shared an asparagus w/ duck egg dish as a starter which was perfectly cooked and flavorful. We then each ordered meat, she had the the short rib, and I the duck. Both cooked medium rare and very tasty indeed. These menu items won't likely be on yours as they only have a few dishes that are always available. From what I gathered this place creates new and exciting meals daily so that each dining experience is different and based on seasonal offerings from both the garden and the farm. All in all we had a great time, you should check it out too!"}
{"text":"Omg what a great find, food amazing w outstanding service our server Ivan was the best.
We highly recommend this gem!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. The food the atmosphere incredible the best meal I've had in years chart octopus amazing my fish the burrata... I cannot wait to go back here this is a must must must"}
{"text":"Outstanding, top-notch restaurant.  We sat outside on the patio, which was truly picturesque and romantic under the Big tree. 

Tried two appetizers, the Polpo (Octopus) was spectacular.  One of the best octopus dishes I have tasted.  Meaty, yet super tender, with a nice smoky finish. The Tuna Crudo was also very good.  We thought the quality of the fish was outstanding, although I found the sauce a bit too sweet for my liking.

The main courses were the Sea Bream, Short Rib and Pasta.  The Sea Bream was delicious with a nice crispy skin and a slightly sweet topping, which worked perfectly.  I thought the standout dish was the Short Rib.  Amazingly tender with sweet pepper and leek sides that took the dish to a whole new level.  The Sauce for the pasta was extremely fresh and felt truly handmade from scratch.

We ended it with a dessert platter, made up of pistachio gelato and pear fig sorbetto, butternut toffee cake, a butternut toffee type mousse, and a strawberry type short cake.  Don't recall the exact names for each dish, but suffice it to say each and everyone was to die for.  It's been a while since we have had desserts of such high quality.  Our group finished everything on the platter, and it was a good sized platter!

The service was friendly, relaxed, yet professional.  Totally on the mark.

In summary, this was one of the best meals we have had in a while, paired with a great outdoor setting, and excellent service.  A memorable meal all around."}
{"text":"On a girls weekend to Phoenix, we stopped in for lunch. Every bit of our experience was fantastic!  The service was attentive and informative without being overwhelming. We tried several different dishes and every single one was fabulous!  From salads to burgers to crepes... try anything! You will not be disappointed. 
As a side note, I am not an adventurous eater, but joined the table in trying Octopus.  The Octopus was delicious, and prepared better than anywhere you've ever experienced!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Good starters.  Favorite was octopus, grilled to perfection. Pork Chop excellent.  But the highlight was Angela, our server.  Nice person, classy, professional, great looking tattoos.  We'd come back just for her."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating at Virtu last Saturday night.  The food was beautifully presented and was delicious.    We were a group of 7 so we sat outside at the community table.  We each tried different dishes and everyone loved them-Duck, Scallops, Flat Iron Steak and Halibut.  We made room for desserts which were also great.  I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very good. I went for restaurant week, we got burrata and salad for starters. Both good, I wish the salad came with some bread or something to spread it on since there was a large goat cheese spread. For dinner we got lamb and duck. Both were large rich portions. The lamb will be about 3 meals for me. I wish there was a little more veggies in the main dishes, they were very rich and meat heavy. For dessert I looooved the hazelnut gelato with espresso. It was small and not a typical dessert dish, but was very tasty. That would be good with a second dessert like cake :)"}
{"text":"We have eaten at VIrtu several times.  The food is excellent.  This week it was for dinner, we had the grilled octopus, pasta and bruschetta with fresh mozzarella.  All simply wonderful.  The service was terrific.  The wine list is a bit limited - and very expensive."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place. Me and my boyfriend went here for our anniversary dinner and it was probably one of the best meals of our life. The service was exceptional; it's a small restaurant so the waiters do pay attention to you and answer any questions you may have. For sure you need to get the octopus if you come here!! At first when I was looking at the pictures I thought the octopus seemed like a rip off cause it looked like such a tiny amount. But we ordered it anyway and surprisingly it was super tasty and tender, not chewy like I was thinking it would be! It also had a good spicy butter and sauce with it. We also ordered the duck which was super delightful and came with a really good pastry that I don't know what it's made of, but it was sweet, crisp, and heavenly! And finally we ordered the steak which was SUPER huge and presentation was really nice. I think it's like $120 just for that dish. It came with a delicious lemon aioli sauce. We were really bloated at the end but we were happy because everything was unique and tasty in flavor. The waiter even threw in a free dessert for our anniversary! So overall I would definitely recommend. It's just pretty pricy, but what else do you expect for fine dining. Lovely place and experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent \"foodie\" dining, an oxymoron sometimes in Scottsdale.  This was pretty sweet,  beautiful ambience, nice outdoors.  Had the hen pate to start, not gamey, not as rich (in a good way) as chicken liver pate, great additions with the plums and mustard.  Then the gnocchi, spiced with pumpkin,  light duck confit, solid.  We then had the sea bream, perfect crispy skin, loved it. Also,  the local farm hen, perfect cook. Solid all around,  pricey for its portions,  but that's fine for being in phoenix area."}
{"text":"We had out of town guests in town and so we walked to dine here and it was fabulous.  That grilled octopus is better than I have ever had and no wonder why-the chef is from Italy and brought his family recipe to the table to share.  Please just work on the service being more attentive and this place would be next to perfect.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing cocktails. Great service! Thank you bar tender Joshua for taking care of us last evening. The place is tiny any with a storm brewing outside, so without having a reservation we chose to eat at the bar. First the cocktails. They will sneak up on you so watch out! Probably the best Gin and tonic I've ever had. My husband, the whiskey drinker, enjoyed all of Joshua's drink recommendations as well.  The food also delicious. We shared  a bread plate, the octopus (a must) and the pork with seasonal veggies. Dessert was a chocolate cake with butterscotch and vanilla ice cream. Everything perfect. We will be back for another drink sooner than later! I  deducted one star because we couldn't get a table. I realize we didn't have a reservation but every table except one was empty the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"First of all the setting is really beautiful where you can come in a jacket and tie or in golf shorts and a tee shirt.  It is really just an attractive and fun atmosphere.  It's an artistic place so the cuisine has that chic/elegant aspect to it.  While very tasty and high end, the cuisine didn't quite reach the heights of The Mission or Cafe Monarch for me.  Still this is another great restaurant in Scottsdale with excellent food and a fetching ambiance."}
{"text":"For some reason I'm in the neighborhood often and it took me this long to finally give it a try.   Some of the most well executed food I've had in a while.  Cocktails are refreshing and the food is well executed. It's a little bit of a cross between Lons at Hermosa with Crudo.   Adorable patio dining (not a huge place so not great for a work HH,) but romantic and a nice change of pace from the rest of the south Scottsdale scene.   Service is impeccable.  Attentive without being obtrusive.  A must try and a welcome entry into the food scene."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check out the new kid in town that has been getting so much of attention on media, excitement from our friends and a nod from James Beard.
We got there early and were blown away by the pretty courtyard with lovely lanterns and pleasing plants all over. 
We sat at the bar waiting for our table and had the most interesting conversation about bitters and how to make them from scratch  with Dante- a charming bartender. I had their version of the old fashioned and hubby tried their Moroccan mojito. Both were just out of this world!
After we were seated outside in the pretty courtyard, we decided to challenge the chef by sending word that we were vegetarians and we liked spicy food. Again, we were blown away. The burrata and spring salad had a major kick to it. And our main course- couscous and roasted vegetables bursting with flavors and textures left us quiet and in a trance for the rest of the dinner. 
We are certainly coming back. Can't wait to exchange secret ingredient notes with Dante and challenge the talented chef all over again."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Jamiroquai - Virtual Insanity)

It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big
That should be small
Who can tell what cocktail spirits, they'll be doing for us

And I'm giving all my love to this restaurant
Only to be told
I can see, I can eat
Bo Bites will we be

And nothing's gonna change they way I Yelp
Cause I can always take and never give
And now that things are serving for the best, see,
Whoa! It's a new craft we're dining in
And I just can see that half of us immersed in drinks
Is all we have to give these stars

Foodies made of Virtu Honest Craftery
now always seem to, be governed by this love I have
For eating, drinking, of new ingredients
Oh now there is no bounds for we all love restaurants


Virtu is was voted best new restaurant by Esquire earlier this year and one thing we know these days is we can trust the news!  Ummmm well, let's not jump the gun just yet and decide for ourselves.  

I came here with a friend for restaurant week.  I ordered a drink and requested the bartender make it spicy since that's my new thing and he was happy to oblige.  Needless to say, I'm always appreciative of good service!  We began with appetizers; the Burrata and Polenta Board.  I took a bite of the Polenta Board my mate ordered and boy was it creamy and cheesy at the same time.  The braised pork atop gave it some extra sweet texture.  My Burrata was the similar I would say; creamy mozzarella ball cheese warm to the cut with prosciutto aside while what seems to be a balsamic reduction drizzled over it.  Overall an excellent start!

For our entree my mate ordered the Flat Iron Steak while I shot for the Seared Orata.  I'm not a big fan of steak in general, but this one in particular was well cooked and seasoned.  My star of the night was my Orata; the skin was crispy to every bite and the fish was still moist and tender.  The dates provided a hint of sourness and the pesto help with subtle sweetness.  

In the end, Virtu definitely delivered to what they sell.  Being best new restaurant is a strong title and their food showed it.  Service was stellar and a must return for this chap! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of, if not the best restaurants in the valley! Chef Gio kills it. Great seasonality to the menu. The octopus is fantastic. Pastas are homemade. One of the best Amari selections in the State! Ambience is perfect for a date! Sit on the patio and be prepared to be blown away. Trust me."}
{"text":"This was on my place to try for a long time and finally had a chance to try here this week. They change menu frequently based on reviews, I knew some of them are always there and I wanted to try them.

First thing I noticed about this restaurant was a rosemary they placed in the napkin and silverware set.  I immediately pulled out of the rosemary and enjoyed the nice scent of rosemary.

Their wine menu consist mainly California and Italy, but a few selections from other parts of the world. Since I wanted to have scallops for dinner, I chose a bottle of Spanish wine, which I somehow finished the bottle. Their wine menu was not extensive but they carry nice wines.

Two of the appetizers I read on others reviews here were Charred octopus and Asparagus, and naturally we ordered both. I always enjoy grilled octopus anywhere, in fact I never had bad grilled octopus. They serve their grilled octopus with chili butter. Chili butter was slightly spicy but when I ate with arugula and octopus together, bitterness of arugula and chili spice blended well with grilled octopus.  Grilled asparagus was also good, slightly runny fried duck egg, mixed with feta cheese, salty bacon, and foie gras hollandaise sauce all together, I cleaned the plate to get the last bit of the hollandise sauce with asparagus.

For dinner, I ordered scallops. I enjoyed my scallops but I enjoyed my friend's duck more.  Duck was cooked medium rare, it was so soft and tender...I almost wanted to say, can we switch?

For desert, I can't remember the name of my food but it was like chocolate mouse but not too sweet at all. I enjoyed my desert with macchiato.

Excellent service, the place was slightly tiny and I heard some conversation from our neighbors (I wasn't listening but I heard them talk, they were on the first date ), It was that close together..  They have nice patio and would love to come back on warmer night.  Definitely foodie heaven here and highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the best new restaurant that I've been to in 2014.  The decor, service and food are all excellent.

I sat at the bar and really enjoyed talking with Dante the bartender.  He was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I had the grilled asparagus appetizer and it was delicious with egg, feta and bacon candy.

My second dish was their signature grilled Spanish octopus.  This was presented beautifully and tasted wonderful.  The octopus was more tender than any I've ever eaten and seasoned perfectly.

I can't wait to come back for another meal and try their desserts."}
{"text":"One of those rare places you have to try before you die.  Do get a reservation; it fills up quickly.

The food is rotates frequently, but is excellent.  The signature item is the grilled octopus - do try it...the char brings out the flavor.

Service here is great, friendly and prompt.  The selection of cocktails is wide-ranging as well.  Always worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great food but the scallops are very very small like four peaces small the stake is great the same goes for the octopus"}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night. Beautiful nite to be outside eating. It's so nice to sit outside on the patio and be able to talk without the noise you usually get in a regular inside restaurant. The drinks are different and very tasty. I had the beef rib w asparagus. Delicious. Be sure to get the sticky toffee cake. Best dessert I've ever had. Fun spot"}
{"text":"This is a more 3 and half rating. My colleage had highly recommendation for Virtu. It's a very lovely place. We went there last Sunday. I really wanted to have some Italian food (maybe a little \"heavy\" food?) but they only served some light food as brunch. I had a grilled cheese, which didn't taste Italian, but it was great. Love the combination, and I think it's very heathy but too light for me at that  time. My husband had a grilled octopus, which the waiter told us it was a big fish that we might want to share. But it's a very not that big enough to be shared. I forgot my desert name, and they don't have the same menu showing online, but it's not bad, too sweet. My husband had gelato which he said it's the best."}
{"text":"We sat at one of the tables outside.   It was intimate and fairly quiet despite being close to the street.  When my husband initially looked at the menu he was somewhat skeptical but he really liked all the dishes we ordered.  The menu changes on a regular basis but it sounds like the octopus dish is a signature dish.  We ordered it and my husband declared it was the best octopus he has had.   Each dish was full of flavor and fresh ingredients.   Service was very good."}
{"text":"Any place that offers grilled octopus for brunch is a winner in my books.  My octopus was nicely cooked and very tasty.  The chile hollandaise was a nice touch.  The French toast was great and almost seemed like I was eating dessert.

I liked the fact I could get espresso. 

The place is pretty cozy with a small patio so you might want to book in advance."}
{"text":"My food was delicious and my manhattan (with another name) was delicious and strong. We were able to get in without reservations. I gave it 4 stars bc it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"Ladies night out! 

Service was perfection. Thank you Courtney! 

The food was delicious. The stand out appetizer was the charred octopus w/ calabrian chile butter although the grilled asparagus with duck egg, candied bacon and foie gras hollandaise was nothing to dismiss. 

For entrees, we had the spaghettini (from the pasta menu), the scallops (with white chocolate beurre blanc), the pork rib chop and I personally ordered the marsala braised short ribs with Brussels sprouts, hazelnuts, currants and vanilla sweet potatoes. Go with friends because you are going to want to try EVERYTHING. You'll be happy you did because everything was amazing. My short ribs were flavorful and were so tender, the meat VIRTU-ally melted right off the bone. 

For wine, I ordered the Coto de Hayas Garnacha...a few times. When it's my time to go, I think drowning in that celestial chocolaty wine aroma is definitely on my short list of ways to die. *I can't remember the name of my cocktail, it had blueberries, shaved lemon zest, whiskey and some other delightful flavors in it and I think I'll go back just to ask them how to make it at home. 

The only thing I was unhappy with was their designated parking lot across the street. They really should have some lights over there because high heels, unlevel surfaces, wine/cocktails and dark walkways are not a pleasant combination. Luckily, their food and drinks are so good that it may be worth breaking an ankle.

*I have just been informed that my cocktail was named \"Fortified Truth\"."}
{"text":"We went here as a couple for Valentine's day. We don't normally go to such expensive places (we're young) but we've been ruined for good food. The waiter was professional and atmosphere was relaxed but very nice. We sat outside as the the weather allowed it. Our first choice was the grilled octopus with chickpeas, it was the bomb!! Very very good. Most think of octopus as chewy but the way this was prepared made it chewy and crunchy on the outside- not rubbery at all. I had the duck (I've never had duck before) served medium rare with caramelized brussel sprouts and blue cheese, every flavor complemented perfectly!! All of our meal was fabulous. Would go again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a pricey and delicious fine dining meal!"}
{"text":"Went during restaurant week and was simply blown away by the atmosphere, service and of course the food. I will definitely be back. The food was so good and they don't rush you out like most restaurants they want you to stay and enjoy your time, in fact we were there for over four hours and didn't even know it that how amazing the atmosphere and food is. I cannot wait to go back and experience more off their amazing menu."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have eaten at Virtu within the last two years.  So disappointed with this last experience.  This is a pricey place that touts itself as \"fit for foodies.\"  Not this time.  My burrata appetizer was the best thing I had, although it did come with a strange parmesan cookie - literally a cookie, not a cracker,  with the consistency of a Lorna Doone.  My entire entree was underwhelming:  the pork chop was a bit overdone, very tough and the flavor was ok.  The broccoli underneath was stringy and flavorless.  My husband's steak was also very tough.  The bread pudding dessert was dry, dry, dry.  Maybe this was an off night for the cook staff, but there are so many better downtown Scottsdale restaurants at this price point that Virtu is now at the bottom of my list."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I am a local and have sent so many people here! Great food, great service! Have never had a bad experience here! Its a must!!!!!"}
{"text":"Please don't ever close -- you'll be missed.

Had the pleasure of dining here during Restaurant Week and the food and the service and the atmosphere and the drinks all lived up to the hype. Every course was done well -- nothing complex or overly worked, just great ingredients and simple presentation. This is the type of place that makes a city \"world class\" and should be on everyone's \"must\" list for the year."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have said, the grilled octopus appetizer is very good. I also had the seared branzino entree and it was very good, too. Although the food was cooked well, the presentation of the dishes was a little bit over complicated for my taste. Every dish had a nest of a crispy fried garnish on it. I'm a little bit of a purist about quality ingredients like those used at Virtu; my philosophy is to \"Keep It Simple, Stupid\". The service, while knowledgable and accommodating, was quite slow; my dinner companions grew frustrated by the pace. I enjoy leisurely dining, though, so it was fine to me. The cocktails are definitely worth trying. I had a Let the Beet Drop and a Johnny Ringo's Epitaph, and both were unique and delicious. I'm torn here; while I definitely enjoyed my meal, I think I would have enjoyed simply grilled octopus and seared branzino even more at a number of different excellent Greek tavernas that I know."}
{"text":"Celebrating my husband's birthday tonight and wanted to revisit this gem. We'd dined here around the holidays last year and loved the experience.
Food is delicious and presentation elevated. We will be back."}
{"text":"Virtu Honest Craft: appropriate name for the food, not the wine.  

Went for dinner on a Sunday evening in July.  The food was excellent, the service was very good at the bar.  I had the squash flowers with goat cheese as an appetizer and the smoked duck entree - both were excellent.   The portions were just the right size

There is only one thing leading to a 3 star review - the wine prices.   The everyday selections cost about as much for a glass as the bottle's retail price.   Most inexpensive wines are marked up to about 4x retail pricing - this is not Honest wine pricing.  The best values on the wine list are some of the mid tier wines at a much more reasonable 2x markup (Gary Farrell Pinot Noir and Perrier Jouet bubbly for example).   But one shouldn't have to buy a $60+ bottle to be treated fairly.  I will get a beer next time.

If they fix the wine pricing, this becomes a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"A real find in #Scottsdale: Unlike the over-showy or underwhelming restaurants that most visitors and locals frequent out of force of habit, Virtu Honest Craft is just a year-old and is showing up all the rest under the direction of its little known chef and owner. GIO Osso who creates high art and flavor explosions with his exquisite gift of \"Italian modern\" cuisine at his new Virtu Honest Craft. Worth the trip to Scottsdale just for this delicious gift to humankind!"}
{"text":"Amazing, creative food and cocktails. I loved that they had a \"Designated Driver\" section on the cocktail menu. Highlights of our meal were:
- Chef's Plate appetizer
- Octopus appetizer
- Scallops main dish
- Toffee & Mascarpone gelato dessert"}
{"text":"Outstanding ambience, inventive, amazing food amd music.  This is the best restaurant in the Phoenix area if you're a foodie."}
{"text":"Visited with a large group for \"Restaurant Week\". We were able to sit on the patio which I highly recommend if the weather is decent as it is tree covered which makes it very intimate,. 
The service was simply amazing. Everything was prompt and all the dishes were explained very well. 
The drink menu is nice, try the Margarita, made with chiles and awesomely spicy. The wine list is decent with some reasonable options. 
Being restaurant week we were able to sample much of the menu. The burrata was a stand out as were the lamb polpettes. The flat iron Steak as an entree was amazing as was the pork chop was amazing fried in crispy polenta. 
This was one of our favorite experiences for all the big \"friend dinners\" we have done. 
The staff, ambience and food was just wonderful. Esquire Magazine rated Virtu as one of the top ten new restaurants in the country and it is not hard to see why. 
Even with all that the prices are completely reasonable, especially for Scottsdale. 
We simply loved it and will return soon!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a dish off the very descriptive menu without pine nuts as one of our party had a severe allergy.  Dish arrived with pine nuts.  When asked why this was not described on the menu, considering every other element of the dish was, the waitress informed us that it was our responsibility to inform her of any allergies.  She took the dish and charged us for it anyway!  We did not argue as we needed to leave urgently to get some benadryl.  The General Manager was informed and was non-responsive.  An otherwise beautiful evening ruined by horrible customer service and a general lack of concern for the \"experience\" part of dining."}
{"text":"If you love outdoor dining their courtyard is for you.  The food was very good and the speciality drinks were really well done.  While I can appreciate the seasonal menu there was not a wide variety of dishes - I think there were about 6-7 main dishes with your standard beef, chicken, fish and pork with a slight variation in beef and one other chicken dish. 

The appetizers were very good with my favorite being the burrata. Grilled octopus was good also. Highly recommend with a small group or a nice couples night out.  A little more on the expensive side so probably not a place you would frequent very often.  Overall great place - got 4 stars for variety of dishes"}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance on the patio, service staff has a good vibe, and the food is unreal. Hands down the best grilled octopus I've ever had. Served with a light and flavorful chili sauce and a bright, zesty simple salad for balance.

I forget what liquid they soak the octopus in, but it is soaked in something and wine corks are added to the liquid. This allows the meat to break down and become tenderized, resulting in a soft, buttery texture inside and a crispy, charred outside. Absolutely phenomenal.

James Beard nominee for best new restaurant and it definitely delivers."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last weekend. The food and ambience were top notch. Highly recommend he gnocchi and octopus. Two of the best dishes I've had in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never dined here before, but so glad I decided to check them out for Restaurant Week. The restaurant is small, but intimate and cozy. We started off with a few cocktails/ I had the Ice Queen which the server recommended as one of the popular drinks with the ladies. I really liked it and gave me a good buzz. 

Our server recommended we get additional dishes outside our 3 course meal for Restaurant Week as the portions are appetizer size so we started with the charred Octopus. It was delicious! For our first entrees, we for burrata and crudo. For our main dish, we ordered the duck and lamb. Everything was impeccable! Our entree though was definitely a good portion and we couldn't eat it all so we didn't need to add more to our 3 course meal like the server suggested. Our dessert was okay - nothing to rave about. 

When we got our bill, it was on the expensive side so don't expect to be spending less than $75/person if you order alcoholic drinks. As the restaurant got more crowded, we barely saw our waiter. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and would probably visit again!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Scottsdale! They always change the menu up and have the perfect pairings."}
{"text":"We went here with one of our cousins.  They have a beautiful outside seating area set up with lights. It was quite the treat to sit out there. We started our with some drinks... They have some very unique cocktails and their moscato is delicious. We got the baked rosemary ricotta with bread. Sooo delicious!!! We also got the grilled calamari. This was a little bit salty for my taste including the salad it was served with.  The texture of the calamari was perfect, not too chewy. For entrees we got the duck, the scallops and the squid ink pasta. The duck was absolutely amazing!!!  The scallops were also cooked perfectly. The squid ink pasta was a little bland and simple and dos not seem to be up to par to the other entrees. For dessert we shared the salted caramel chocolate cake. Amazing!!!  Overall, great food, had some down points as listed above.  The ambience is unbeatable!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Virtu n Binkley's in Cave Creek are must for anyone who appreciates a dining experience. Not nearly as costly as Binkleys but just about as delicious. 
Overlooked and underrated, Virtu is always a great experience. Dinner and Sunday brunch ....A-1"}
{"text":"Dinner early December 2016.  Very good overall.  Ate outside on the patio.  Relatively limited menu but everything we had was very good.  Octopus outstanding, duck entree as well.  Would return again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband this past Sunday for brunch.  I was surprised to see that it was empty but maybe it was just the time that we arrived.  Its a very cute but small location.  We decided to sit inside because it was rather hot out.  We started off with drinks..my husband ordered a moscow mule and I got the blood & basil.  Both drinks were great..mine was very refreshing!  We ordered the grilled cheese and the classic crepe.  Both were fantastic and had such great flavors!  Also very large portions.  Can't wait to come back and try their dinner!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing a lot about this cozy spot, voted one of the \"Best New Restaurants in America\" by Esquire magazine.  That's a lot to live up to, and precisely why when a reputation precedes you - expectations tend to be higher.

Virtu is located at the equally comfy Bespoke Inn, where each suite is unique and has a private patio ($249 for a night). Gourmet brunch at Virtu is included in the room rate.

Seating at Virtu is limited inside and out - with one intimate table for two outside, two tables for four, and a large community. Heat lamps are ubiquitous so you can always sit outside.  It is quite tranquil with the bubbling fountain in the courtyard, and old gnarled trees strung with lights and lanterns.  Inside the mood is more upbeat, but lighting equally conducive for romance and intimacy. 

There are ten tables inside with bar seating. When we arrived at 6p on a Tuesday night, a few tables were occupied - we were the only people outside.

***BEST THING TO KNOW ABOUT VIRTU: COME EARLY FOR DINNER, NO MATTER THE DAY OF THE WEEK. BY 6:30P IT STARTS TO GET BUSY. RESERVATIONS ARE IDEAL IF COMING AT A LATER TIME. ONCE THE RESTAURANT FILLS UP, EXPECT A LONGER WAIT FOR YOUR FOOD. 

Having arrived there before the rush, our appetizers came out quickly, but our one entree of house made spaghetti ordered, took nearly an hour.

By 7:30 we were handed a dessert menu, but having been there an hour and a half - we were ready to head home.  Another ten min wait to get the check...

Disclaimer:
When you're pregnant and hungry you don't want to wait an hour for your food.  Pregnant and tired you don't want to sit there for twenty minutes twiddling your thumbs because your partner finished his cocktail long ago, and you already polished off your second mock tail....

So, how was the food? 
Half dozen starters from Grilled Octopus (fennel, arugula, lemon chick pea, chile butter) to Grilled Asparagus (egg, feta, bacon candy, foie gras hollandaise, truffle oil).  Also Tartare Duo of Steak and Ahi Tuna, Winter Vegetable Salad, and Chef's Rillette.  Avg. price: $14

We ordered the Asparagus and Octopus.
Asparagus - Six small pieces of asparagus, couple tablespoons of feta, hollandaise that does not smack or reminisce of my beloved foie, nor any truffle oil -and an over abundance of candied bacon makes it unique, but a disappointment not worth $14, for someone who loves foie and truffle.  I would have brought this up to our server, but I had already sent back the Octopus.

Octopus - tender but very charred and dry on outside, and almost cold.  Server stated it gets cold quickly, and explained effects of char grilling food (I know what char-grilling is, but come on). Long story short he offered to have the appetizer redone and it came back perfectly executed.  And yes, when it's done right I think it's probably the best dish on this menu and why everyone that has tried it, loves it so much.

Of the entrees, there are 9 of them, and average price is $30 - starting with Prosciutto Wrapped Pork Rib Chops, Scallops, Seared Ahi Tuna, Smoked Duck Breast, Seared Branzino, Squid Ink Linguini, Nieman Ranch Ribeye, and Grilled Monkfish fillet.

We tried the House made Spaghetti with Osso Bucco.  After having waited an hour for our Spaghetti, we were disappointed at the al dente style of the noodles.  Our server explained they were made with semolina flour, which are typically on the al dente side - but just not to our liking.  The sauce was great and the shredded veal   tender and flavorful - Although there was so much, and it was so rich, almost bordering on the greasy side.  It just seemed off on such a traditional dish.  It was more like having shredded pork with a side of chewy spaghetti.  When I order Osso Bucco, it's traditionally the shank with the bone in it.  So this was not what I expected, either.

When it comes to food, I am all about texture, and despite loving inventive twists and even esoteric fare, I am a traditionalist when it comes to comfort foods like Spaghetti. 

So, food wise, there are too many wonderful options out there in the valley - but those that have commented on how amazing and clever the cocktails are, are right!  It is worth coming here for Happy Hour and going down the menu.  Although I merely took a small swish to sample on our visit, I could tell that the Bar Master here has a true knack for his craft.  The Nuova Bellezza $11, is a great example with Alexander Grappa, St. Germain, Cabernet Syrup, Lime Juice, and Red Grapes.  The online menu does not do the offerings justice, find a more thorough and extensive cocktail journey at the bar.

So based on the other reviews, perhaps on our visit it was an off night.  Perhaps we had too many expectations, or just did not order dishes that were an accurate reflection of Chef Gio Osso's talent.  But with a Machiavellian name for achieving excellence, I feel Virtu should have lived up to its name."}
{"text":"I came for dinner and was very pleased! I ordered a delicious salad (I don't remember what it was called, but it had candied kumquats- it was amazing!) and my date ordered the pork chop. He's a huge foodie, said, and I quote, \"this is life changing\". The toffee pudding with the marscapone cream was also just incredible! Selection of drinks is very extensive, and service was wonderful. Also, we were running late for our reservations and they pushed it back 15 minutes, which was very appreciated!"}
{"text":"Good was absolutely wonderful. My bff took my husband and I here for an intimate dinner outside in the courtyard and the waiter brought us blankets in case we were still chilly. The food is amazing. Def try the octopus!! And the short ribs were divine. Great service too!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this restaurant. The ambiance is incredible, very simple but sophisticated. The patio will be incredible in the cooler months. I went for brunch and was blown away by the ricotta pancakes and the crepe. I cannot wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and nice atmosphere, generally big portions. We got the buratta to start, which was wonderful. Got squid ink linguine and pork chop and they were both absolutely delicious. The only catch was their tap water tasted odd; and have pretty bad service as they're busy-- I'm guessing they're understaffed. Generally good however, would recommend but probably won't visit again for a while."}
{"text":"The food was great with nice ambience. However, I did not like the fact that the kitchen was right next to the dining area. This is a small restaurant and the kitchen ventilation is not very good. It gets stocky easily when sitting inside. It was supposed to be a romantic restaurant but my shirt smelled like I just had some grill BBQ after my dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service and this is coming from a non-foodie. I tend to think all places are pretty much the same, but this place takes is much better than anything I have tried. The ambiance is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Love love love! this is my husbands and I \"go to\" Resturant. The Staff is friendly and service is great. Delicious food of course. Great for lunch or date night."}
{"text":"The ambiance? is always great. Food was wonderful.  Service was warm and enhanced the experience.  Enjoyable... octopus was tender.  Pig ears had an Asian? flair and tasty.   The pork chop was tender (Nieman? Ranch) and brought together with a 2014 Frank Family Cabernet and great new friends."}
{"text":"Gio has hit this out of the ballpark. The interior is impeccable, the setting is quaint and ideal for a restaurant of this caliber. Make a reso for dinner!  Enjoy the brunch ASAP!

While the wine list is limited and the food has a different approach that is precisely why you come here- step outside of our comfort zone of favorite foods and expand our horizons. The mixology is magical and the cuisine is dependably creative."}
{"text":"A friend took me today for a Birthday lunch. It was a great choice! The atmosphere was comfortable, the staff was very friendly, and the food was spot on :) I can't want to go back and try the dinner menu. Although everything we tried today rocked ..leaving room for the chocolate bite dessert was well worth it! I'll be recommending this place to all my friends for sure.

UPDATE: Today I went back for my third visit. They were serving a brunch menu that was out of this world. I love that the menu is so dynamic ...and that they've left a couple of favorites like the Starter Kit cocktail on the menu as a terrific way to begin any meal. I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggest to us by a friend as we were looking for a brunch place to take my parents for their 60th wedding anniversary. I called ahead and explained what I was looking for. The staff was very helpful and even suggested the table to reserve.  They included mimosas for the \"newlyweds\". We had a delightful brunch. Our server was attentive. Each dish was copious and enjoyed by its recipient.  We will come again."}
{"text":"I am in love with this restaurant!!  What a pleasure to stumble on this unique little gourmet piece of heaven on earth!!  From the pleasing ambience that feels like you're in France, the great personal service, and the incredibly unique menu!!  For lunch, we enjoyed the raclette grilled cheese dish and pork ragu dish...mmmm!!This downtown Scottsdale find is not to be missed!!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my wife's b-day during lunch hour. We sat outside and the vibe was really good. The brunch menu were given and the price seem to be fair. We otdered three dishes, the pancake, octopus, and egg sausage. Every dishes were really good and tasty. It gave me high expectation for the dinner menu. The outdoor tables r very cozy and has some natural feel to it. It would be great place to hangout with family and friends. Only downside is that the menu is bit limited and there is nothing much to order for kids. Otherthan this, we had a great time here. We will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate dinner last evening at Virtu, Scottsdale, Arizona.  From the very moment we walked in, we knew this was going to be a wonderful experience.  The hostess was incredibly accommodating and so polite.  The ambiance was very cozy and quaint and very European.  The entire staff was incredibly attentive and on point all evening.  OK, the food.  mind blowing.  The Polpo is a must try for your starter course.  May very well be one of our top 5 dining experiences ever.  Keep up the incredible work Virtu.  We will most certainly return soon.

{"text":"We came here for my husband's birthday dinner. The receptionist who took our reservation was awesome. I'm vegetarian and she spent a lot of time explaining the menu making sure I had enough options to select. The food is good but not great and the service is pretty slow. We will probably give it one more chance before ruling it out completely."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and they only served brunch food, so we were a little dissapointed at first... I ordered one of the crepes and my friend ordered the pork ragu. Both of the dishes were surprisingly big portion sized and really good! I'm going to come back and try the dinner menu and I'll review some more."}
{"text":"I went in with no expectations, as neither my date or I had ever been there. I was pleasantly surprised at every turn. The service was great, the food was delicious and the ambiance was perfect. It provided a wonderfully romantic evening for us. I suppose I should give some credit for that to my date, since she was quite gifted both intellectually and aesthetically. Still, Virtu is definitely worth trying. We sat outside, which might not have worked out during the summer months, but weather permitting, the patio is delightfully whimsical, and I don't use those words lightly (or ever. In the interest of full disclosure, I may have engaged the services of thesaurus.com to find the perfect word). If this place doesn't get you to date #2, it's you."}
{"text":"Super knowledgeable wait staff  (both food and cocktails/wine), their desserts really shine!!! Came back a day later to have dessert after being disappointed at another \"great\" restaurant :)
The toffee one is crack :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful outside spot which we got a reservation in.  We tried the Octopus and Grilled Asparagus with Duck Eggs starters.  Both were excellent.  The mains were not quite as exciting, but still pretty solid - Duck Breast and Pork Chop. In particular we thought the pork w as a little tough.
Service was great, thought price was reasonable"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Every bit as good as we expected, from drinks, to apps, entrees, dessert, and service. The venue is intimate and permits conversation without shouting, even on a reasonably busy weekend night."}
{"text":"As good as it gets in The Valley!  Probably closer to 4.5 stars.

The space at Virtù is warm and inviting.  My service was extraordinarily friendly and help.

Charred octopus truly may be the best dish in the area at the moment.
Smoke duck breast was supurb!  Very minor, but the dish probably didn't need the foie gras tart.  The duck with frites and foie could stand on their own.  

I'd go back."}
{"text":"First time at Virtu! Made reservations about 2 days before, and the hostess called to confirm. Me and my s/o arrived at 6:30pm and the hostess sat us immediately. Our server greeted us within the fist minute of seating, and he was wonderful from there! We ordered drinks, and the Ice Queen was amazing, although rather expensive, but totally worth it. Since my s/o is a vegetarian I thought they would have at least some options on the menu to choose from, they barely had 2 out of the entire menu! And the one option they did have for a main course (pasta), he said was mediocre at best. Really disappointing. My short rib was amazing, but when the one your with isn't enjoying themselves, it's hard to enjoy it as well. 5 for the service, 5 for the drinks, but 2 for the menu options :/."}
{"text":"It was our first time visiting tonight after it was recommended by friends. It was small but with a nice, upscale atmosphere. The patio outside looked great for when the weather gets nicer. We sat at the bar where the bar tender was friendly and willing to craft up any concoction we requested. All the drinks were delicious and made with fresh ingredients. We tried some small plates, entrees and desserts. The small plates seemed a better value than the entrees (which were very small and pricey) but all the food was delicious. The desserts were awesome. The homemade noodles were really great. Honestly the only downside of the place was the price, all the food and drinks were outstanding."}
{"text":"OMG! 

Yes that was my first impression, and definitely eat in the outside patio, you'll feel like your in Spain. The ambiance is 6 stars, I wished I came here sooner, as I would be a regular. 

The staff is wonderful, they know the product and will tell you which one is the top seller; however, I can't see what would be bad. 

The food is killer, small plates, large plates it doesn't matter. So, uniquely plated and so complex the taste, it's a melody in the mouth. I ordered the pulpo (octopus) which was so fresh and clean tasting, it paired so well with the arugula and fennel salad. Then I had the smoked duck and gnocchi. Both were just outstanding. 

Sadly I've left Scottsdale for now, but I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Girls night out on a Sunday.  We arrived right at opening, so it was on the slow side.  I had previously made reservations and indicated we had a show to attend and were in a bit of a time crunch. Our server acknowledged this without our mentioning it, and was very prompt, while still being personable.  The food is amazing - the Burrata starter is fabulous - portions large enough to share or have as an entrée.  I enjoyed the Gnudi and my friend had the scallops - both delicious.  The restaurant is adorable, and in the heart of Old Town.  Parking lot across the street is free and convenient.  Signage indicates brunch - I imagine this is amazing, as they have a quaint patio."}
{"text":"This place is a must!!!
The food is amazing, great tasting and presentation!
The wait staff is extremely friendly and helpful.
The only draw back is the acoustics, as is it a bit loud inside. It would not be good for older people or those who are hard of hearing. However if the weather is nice and you can sit outside the place would be perfect. 

Recommendations: Octopus is a must!

Matt was an excellent waiter."}
{"text":"Made a reservation through Open Table and when my date and I arrived back in September the temp was 98 outside. Despite the fact there were open tables inside we were told that since we had not made our reservation directly with restaurant we would have to dine on patio. Major attitude in providing this news as if we were second class citizens. 
Contacted their website to register our complaint. Have been ignored for two months which is why I am posting this now."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for Virtu as I have seen pictures and it looked so cute. While it was a cute patio with fountains etc and the service was great, I was very disappointed in the food (as were my friends). I had the recommended lemon ricotta pancakes, which were presented beautifully. However, I didnt get any hint of lemon or ricotta and they were VERY dry. I sopped up the drizzle of syrup on the side and then didnt finish the rest because of the dry texture. My friends had similar opinions of their crepes, egg sandwich and cast iron skillet breakfast."}
{"text":"My group loved it!  Very accommodating for vegan and vegetarian. Food was delicious.  Desserts got great reviews.  Not a fan of the octopus."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent service. Try the pork ragu it's a must have. The French toast is also incredible. Awesome cozy patio too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food...Excellent
Service...Below Average
Ambience...Great"}
{"text":"The ambiance is so relaxing I could easily sit here all day until they kick me out, and the food lives up to its reputation. My lunchtime waiter was attentive but didn't hover. Service was quick but not rushed. Prices are good for the quality. Save room for the locally make gelato and sorbet. I had the lemon sorbet which was the creamiest I've ever had. Delicate yet delivers a hardy kick of flavor. Great place to de-stress for a quiet weekday lunch when it's less crowded."}
{"text":"This is the new place to go for happy hour! The mixologist knows what he is doing and the chef is really creating some lovely food. The happy hour is pretty special-there's a number of small plates priced from $4-6.00 and several dollars off of some great cocktails and wine.
We had the roasted peppers ( WOW) , the ricotta salata and the tortilla( Spanish style). 
The tempura white anchovies were fabulous.
Later we stayed for dinner and had the octopus salad and arugula and berries salad. Each dish was prepared with the highest quality ingredients.
We had a vegetarian in the group and they prepared a beautiful pasta for her since there's not a lot of vegetarian options for entrees.
It's a small intimate place inside the Bespoke Inn-which I definitely want to check into-it looks very special.
I'm looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Most amazing brunch in all of Scottsdale.  NOTHING on the entree menu is more than 16$ and everything is absolutely delightful.  It's every day of the week and i honestly wish i could go every day.  Also highly recommend the chistorra and egg - the entire menu is amazing!"}
{"text":"I chose this place to go to as my birthday dinner, and I couldn't have made a better choice! The atmosphere was romantic and relaxing, and a little upscale. The restaurant is beautiful and perfectly Italian. Our waited, Matthew, was so friendly and amazing. He made the night so special. We ordered the fortified truth cocktail, and it was perfect. With the grapefruit and cinnamon combination, it was sweet but not too sweet. We were talked into the octopus appetizer because it's their specialty... It was great! I'm not into seafood like that, but it was definitely tasty and worth trying. My boyfriend finished the rest. I had the 5 cheese gnudi as my main course... Incredible! Soft, doughy, cheesy... Everything pasta should be. We had the white chocolate panacotta for dessert and that was perfect. It was too filling and the flavors were perfectly balanced. Everything is so fresh, and the menu changes daily. To top it off, our waiter gave us 2 free glasses of wine and free dessert! A wonderful night."}
{"text":"Had a lovely evening with some friends at Virtu. The interior and exterior are very picturesque and the menu selections we had were fantastic.

We started with the asparagus and octopus appetizer. the octopus was very tender and beautifully presented. The asparagus was perfectly cooked with a great combination of textures and flavors.

We all each ordered a different protein dish and shared a bit of them with each other. Each person's entree was superb, well prepared, and flavorful. Out of all the dishes my favorite was probably the flat iron steak. It was perfectly medium rare, tender, and well seasoned. 

My actual entree was a fish course which I unfortunately can't remember the name to (Started with an O), and was a white-fleshed fish. It was cooked perfectly with a crispy skin contrasting with soft, tender meat. It was beautifully presented and the sauce, prosciutto, and vegetables went well with the fish. It was a good portion of food (2 fillets). The only negative (And a big negative for me) was that I had a large, long bone in one of my fillets. If I am paying close to $30 for my entree of filleted fish you better get all the bones out! 

Dessert was exquisite, and they even have affogato ($7) which was a heavenly mixture of hazelnut gelato with espresso. 

Service was warm and friendly and our iced teas were refilled as needed. The waiter had excellent knowledge of the menu.

Overall it was a pleasant night and this is a great place for a date night or for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice dinner after hiking camelback trail and found Virtu. We were seated in the outdoor patio with warmers and fairytale lights .   The atmosphere was relaxed but sophisticated.    The indoor seems louder.    The food was excellent .   The selection consisted of 4 appetizers, 2 pastas and 5 main entrees.    The octopus was tender and the combination of flavors was wonderful .   The surprise was the beef crudo-- exceptional... needs more then 2 pieces of toasts.    The pasta with red sauce was as good as any Boston north end restaurant.      My sea bass was perfectly prepared-- crispy skin, not too oily , and the fish moist .    
Always partial to dessert , we had the English cake with toffee and the budino (creamy pudding).    Yummmmm"}
{"text":"We ate here for Restaurant Week and am so happy we selected Virtu!  

Everything about the restaurant was great!  It's a small restaurant and the best part is the amazing patio seating.  If the weather permits you HAVE to sit outside!  

We had the prosciutto wrapped pork chop & grilled flat iron.  Typically when we think of flat iron steak as a thin, flank steak but this was a thick, perfectly cooked steak.  
The affogato for dessert was the best dessert I've ever had!  

The food and ambiance were great but the best part of the meal was our server, George.  I'm not sure if we've ever had a server as great as he was.  

I look forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the 2nd time last night. The specials for AZ Restaurant Week were out of this world. 

Don't miss out on:
- Cocktails. House made mixers and syrups. Talented bartenders.
- Burrata. Outstanding. 
- Squash Ravioli with Goat Cheese. Dear baby Jesus I hope they add this to the menu permanently!!
- Squash blossom appetizer

The place is off the charts cozy and the patio is lovely. Great wait staff and just all-around great place to enjoy a lovely meal."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance only surpassed by Matt who expertly navigated us through the wine list and menu.

Thanks!  Gene & Ave' Micco"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Virtù for so long so when my parents asked me to choose a restaurant for Easter Brunch I was so excited to choose this place. The atmosphere is beautiful and we totally lucked out with the weather so we sat outside. The highlight was no doubt the food. We started with the insalata and it was perfectly balanced, seasoned, and dressed then between the four of us we had the christorra and eggs, mortadella sandwich, pork ragu, and octopus. Everything was PERFECT. We then finished with affogato, blood orange gelato, espresso, and a latte. I can't imagine a more perfect brunch. The service was also phenomenal! Now I definitely see what all the hype is about this place."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of staying in the beautiful hotel, bespoke which is integrated and apart of this lovely restaurant. Over the two days we enjoyed brunch, desert (two nights) and cocktails on the patio at Virtu. We even drove back across phoenix on our last night to enjoy the atmosphere and desert after eating downtown. Everything we ate and saw on other tables was outstanding. The atmosphere, staff and food makes this a place we will revisit next time in phoenix."}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant from start to finish.  I went for my anniversary, drank and ate too much, and I am already looking forward to my next birthday/anniversary/special occasion to go back!  I started off with a cocktail and moved into a red wine as the food started to arrive.  It is evident that the menu is well thought out and is deliberately crafted to eliminate indecision while offering a wide array of choices. 

The plates come out as works of art that taste as good as they look.  I started with the truffled steak tartare and my wife with the burrata.  Truffle was not overwhelming but present, followed by the mushroom cream sauce laced with capers and finished with the delicious tartare.  A must for those considering a steak tartare!  The burrata also amazing, individual ingredients are amazng but when combined, watch out, outrageous.  

After finishing appetizers came time for entrees, I the squid ink linguine and my wife the duck breast.  These were both well crafted and cooked to perfection all around.  Duck was well matched by the kale and tabouleh.  The linguine, perfection for those who would appreciate a squid ink linguine, deep flavor throughout, lightened up by fresh cherry tomatoes and white wine sauce.  The dish also includes a grilled octopus which was a plus as I did not opt for the octopus appetizer, despite wanting to, and a very tasty linguica sausage.  (America would be a better place with a little more linguica)... 

Finished with a PB&J desert which was over the top, too much to eat in one sitting and as a result I am very much so looking forward to an excellent lunch as well!! We took or time and felt very welcome for the duration.  More places need to be like Virtu."}
{"text":"Perfect place for date night on the patio.  Food was delicious especially the Barratta and the Lamb.   

Our server, Emily, made it a particularly amazing experience.  Good food is ubiquitous but we find great service rare in Arizona.  I hope the owners recognize the value she brings to their venue.  We will definitely return and we will certainly request her section."}
{"text":"Virtu has been on my radar since it opened, and I decided to finally bite the bullet and shell out some big (but not big as usual, thank you Restaurant Week!) bucks for dinner last weekend. It was. so. worth. it.

We had a 7:00 p.m. reservation on Saturday and arrived a few minutes early. We passed the time at the bar and I ordered a glass of wine. Bartender followed us out holding my drink to help us navigate to our patio seat. It's little above-and-beyond gestures like this that separate the rookies from the pros, people.

We lucked out with the mid-May weather this evening: GORGEOUS. The quaint background of Bespoke's courtyard and twinkle lights that created the most amazing early-summer atmosphere. As the sun went down, I decided wanted to move in and never leave.

Onto the important stuff: DINNER. Our server Stacey (I think that's her name!) was so friendly and helpful. Our restaurant week choices were:

-Simple salad for me: fresh arugula, sliced peaches, radish, crushed hazelnuts and a parmesan vinaigrette. Lots of textures intertwining here. A perfectly balanced and refreshing start to my meal.

-Sausage polpette for him: 3 sausage meatballs tossed in an AMAZING red sauce that seemed like it had been simmering all day, accompanied with a dollop of ricotta and grilled crostini. Fiance: \"I just want to eat a gigantic bowl of this.\" 

-Brown butter gnudi for me: Oh my sweet weeping infant mercy soul. Ricotta pillows sauteed in brown butter, tossed with English peas and mushrooms, some more of those crushed hazelnuts and topped with shaved pecorino. This. Was. Life. Affirming. I ate the entire bowl. I do not regret.

-Grilled pork rib chop for him: I was told this was the best pork in the history of mankind. It came with roasted carrots/asparagus and was served on top of a rosemary/goat cheese fondue. I KNOW!!! A gentleman sitting next to us spied the chop and immediately declared his order the same. A good game-time-decision, sir!

...and onto DESSERT. We shared the strawberry olive oil cake (the most amazing, summery, juicy strawberries you have ever eaten, accompanied by pistachios and vanilla whipped cream draped over a perfect, not too sweet cake), and the chocolate peanut butter cup, which was basically out of control. A small, RICH portion of peanut butter mousse layered with chocolate mousse layered with crunchy chocolatey toffee. Two words: TO DIE. 

So yes, Virtu is basically perfection. If I had a larger bank account, we would have much more frequent meals here. It is now my \"special events\" dinner default. There is no other choice."}
{"text":"What I want to say is please don't go to Virtu. Don't make it so popular that I can't get in any time I want. But that would be wrong. It's too amazing to keep to myself. It might be my favorite restaurant in the whole world. Also, shut up and order the octopus appetizer. Yes it's weird to think about, so don't think, just order and enjoy. Get anything else you want on the menu, it doesn't really matter because every damn thing is outstanding. You're welcome. Also, our server Matt was fun and brilliant and extremely professional. And fun. Yes, I know I sad fun twice. That's how good he was. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Ham and Gruyere crepe at brunch--GET IT!!  I was actually sad when I was too full to finish it.  I also had the burrata, which was delicious, but I would have liked a crostini or something for the sake of texture.  I ate dinner here a few months back, and, I honestly thought it was a little overpriced and overhyped.  The food was good, but I can't remember what I had, which tells me it wasn't stellar.  I like the atmosphere, and the service was great both times.  I probably won't return for dinner but will definitely be back for brunch!"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale on business and asked a friend for a dinner suggestion. She mentioned Virtu so we made a reservation through Open Table. We were looking forward to a nice evening at the end of a busy week. Unfortunately, things went badly once we got there.

The outside area was inviting but there was no hostess/host to be found. A couple sitting near the entrance pointed us to the inside part of the restaurant. The hostess was nowhere to be found. We waited about 5 minutes and then she appeared. No apologies, fine, it was warm and she wanted to stay inside. She found our reservation and then in a panic told us our table needed to be checked. Eventually she seated us in the front where there was no one around. It was like being relegated to the bad kids table. Forget about the fact that the table was covered with leaves. When we asked her for another table she said \"there is no place else to seat you\" which was patently not true.

So, about the food: at best average. Grilled octopus was reasonable but nothing special. Pork chop with peaches was serviceable but lacked any wow factor. Mu buccatini was oily and had minimal flavor despite the multitude of ingredients.

Service was competent. Some might find being referred to as \"guys\" at a James Beard award winning restaurant off putting but by this point we were done. Too much hype, not enough substance. Pity because we have to come back for business and would have liked to have found something besides steakhouses and Mexican restaurants for our dinners. The only reason I am giving a 2 star instead of a 1 star was that I feel sorry for the wait staff."}
{"text":"I came to visit my boyfriend for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary. He booked us reservations here and we were such pleasantly treated. However, there was construction going on when we went and finding the restaurant was a bit difficult with the limited street lights. Once we got inside, everything was all better! The hostess seated us and we had an amazing female server! She recommended a lot of the great dishes we had this evening and was super friendly. The decor is cute and cozy, with a cute touch to the silverware and napkins. I appreciate little things like that at restaurants. We even got a complimentary glass of champagne each because of our anniversary celebration. The meal was delicious and would love to return one day.

- Polpo: this octopus dish was so yum! The arugula on the side with the orangey sauce...even better! The octopus was soft and not chewy as you would usually get octopus as when grilled. The pieces were almost melt-in-your-mouth amazing! 
- Oriecchie: best pigs' ears I have ever had in my life! They're like chips, super light and crunchy with a light sweet and sour flavor to it. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dish. Definitely recommend!
- Bucatini: not your usual spaghetti noodle, because these were hollow! Very chewy textured noodles that I really enjoyed with the sweet cherry tomatoes in the sauce and fried egg! Portion was perfect for the amount of dishes we ordered. Recommend to order too!
- Maiale: they're known for their pork chop entree so I had to order. The pork chop was super filling and was cooked perfectly medium. The crisp on the outside and soft tender on the inside. I forced myself to finish the dish so I wouldn't waste, but it was too good to waste. The caramelized onions were also a good touch to it. 
- Anatra: my boyfriend had the smoked duck with a side of veggies and that yummy taleggio phyllo! 
- S'mores panna cotta: I forgot the original name, but this dessert was so yummy! The soft panna cotta with the bits of graham crackers and chocolate topped our evening off! 

Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"WOW!!!!! What an experience! My husband took me here for our anniversary. He picked this place because of the reviews and we ourselves are both Chefs in Las Vegas. He certainly picked right! The cocktails were amazing! The ambiance was beautiful! The food was perfectly seasoned, artistically plated and sooooo delicious! Everything we ordered was amazing! We will definitely be coming back next time we are in town! Thank you for making our anniversary that much more memorable! Cheers"}
{"text":"Went to Virtu last night.  Great patio but the food is sensational. Had the Octopus app and Pork Chop entree all recommended by the waiter.  Octopus was a great start. Pork chops can be tricky often dry and not tender.  This chop was spot on juicy, tender and very flavorful. Highly recommend Virtu"}
{"text":"The indoor space is cute but very cramped. I hit my head on the chandelier in the very small bathroom, and the staff has to go out one door and back in another to get around the space to deliver food and drinks. Everything on the menu sounds fancy and the yelp photos look good, but our food was overcooked and the salad was mostly just lettuce. They do not have any vegetarian options despite the fact that the menu says vegan options are available."}
{"text":"Virtu is perfection.

It's an intimate neighborhood restaurant just a couple blocks from Old Town. The food is inventive, Mediterranean-inspired, and delicious.

We had the trio of small plates with tuna tartare, a sausage/potatoes dish, and croquettes. Then we shared a bucatini pasta which was fabulous. But the highlight was the grilled octopus. I am still dreaming of that dish! 

I am so glad we did not skip dessert. We had a butterscotch pudding that was divine. 

The wine list is very creative with several regional French, Italian, and Spanish options.  

Service was also exceptional.

This restaurant ranks for me with some of my favorite meals at top fine dining establishments around the world. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Some of the best quality and flavorful food in AZ. I have been here for both dinner and brunch and can happily say I have never had a dull or lackluster meal. The octopus and asparagus are to die for and you cannot go wrong with any of the cocktails. Great wine menu, knowledgable servers... I could go on and on. Thank you Virtu for stepping up AZ's food game. We need more restaurants like you!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. Loved the fish, I wish I remembered the name of it but it was a white mild fish with seared skin. Perfectly cooked. The portions were a bit small for my date, so I would suggest getting appetizers if you are really hungry.  The cocktails were also perfect and I am very picky. I ordered the Ice Queen and a moscow mule. The ambiance is romantic. The outdoor seating is European style with pretty lights. Perfect weather right now to sit outside at night."}
{"text":"Virtu Honest Craft USA is a very intimate restaurant located in downtown.   

The menu is limited. The items we ordered were all deliciously and beautifully presented. We ordered the octopus and pate appetizers to share. For our meal we had the short rib and scallops. Both were prepared to perfection. The pistachio gelato dessert was yummy. 

Nathan was our waiter. He was attentive and friendly. We had a great evening."}
{"text":"Amazing. We sat inside at one of their cozy few tables.  The octopus was tender and flavorful. I had never had anything like it and was impressed!  I just hope they use sustainable seafood.  We are wine drinkers so didn't try the cocktails, but our cousin raves about them.  

Definitely a place for a special dinner for those that love culinary delights."}
{"text":"We had or birthday dinner there and they were so generous giving us free dessert and the atmosphere is to die for! A must try place!  the duck asparagus and sticky chocolate cake are amazing!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING! Look forward to returning. Waaaaay top 5 in Phoenix/Scottsdale. Fernando was the perfect host for our dining experience. Oh, and portions are quite large ... wow!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, fabulous drinks 
Loved the charred octopus- best octopus I've eaten so far.loved the asparagus.
Main course- duck was amazing
Finished with choc toffee cake
In heaven
It's pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"I have generally not been wowed by my Scottsdale restaurant experiences.  Good food, yes, but not great (aside from FnB, which is amazing).  That changed when I had dinner at Virtu last night.  Excellent food, service, and environment.  It's up there with some of the great restaurants I've been to around the world.

The space reminded me of downtown Palo Alto.  Cozy, not too loud, comfortable.  Especially on a late spring evening with its perfect weather.

Service was well balanced with just the right amount of attention and right level of information to allow our group to make wise food choices.

The food itself:

- The grilled octopus was excellent.  Nice and meaty, with a little bit of tang
- The crispy pig ears were interesting.  Had a little bit of crunch, a little bit of chew, and a nice sweet flavor
- The burrata was delicious.  Smooth and accented well with the sides
- The asparagus was very nice.  Just enough bite and seasoned well
- The giant tomahawk steak (shared by 3) was off the charts good.  I could immediately tell it was dry aged.  Just a rich cut of meat cooked exactly as requested (medium rare).  It just made me happy
- The budino was smooth, rich, sweet and the perfect ending to a great meal

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I would give this a five star rating because the food, ambiance and our server, Jenny, are deserving of it.  However our first impression was with the hostess, Margaret, who so lacked good manners, it set the tone for the meal.  A restaurant of this quality needs to employ a grownup with customer service skills to greet and seat guests."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh, unique, classy.

Octopus, asparagus, and trout appetizers - 10/10
Squid ink pasta, Porcetta, and tuna entrees - 10/10
Cocktails - 10/10

Lifesavers instead of regular breath mints sealed the deal for me"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have eaten here. It is not cheap but the food is amazing!  Their octopus appetizer is one of the best dishes we have ever eaten. Scallops are excellent! Not usually a duck fan but our son ordered it and it was delicious. Amazing food and the presentation is a work of art."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends from out of town and had a great experience!  We shared the gnocchi dish, chicken dish, and fish entree.  All of them had really good flavors and were well executed."}
{"text":"Delicious well paired elements. We ordered the tender scallops, the succulent pork chop ( generous portion) and the gnudi. butter and spice flavorings galore. No skimping. When we sat down we enjoyed the rosemary sprig that scented the air and prepared us to enjoy our meal. We started with the crisp kale salad that we shared. Delicious and light. One note was the generous use of salt. Not too much just noticeable. The atmosphere reminded us of a Tuscany hideaway. The wait staff were informed and answered all of our questions. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Food is beautifully prepared and wonderfully delicious.  Charming, intimate spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely gorgeous, intimate space that was very romantic.  The doors were open to the patio on a warm winter evening.  Tried the signature grilled octopus which was very tender, pretty spicy.  The grilled asparagus with duck egg is getting common but Was very tasty.  Entrées were terrific, I had a great crispy skin fish and we also got the ribeye for 2 which really was perfect.  Service was great, thank you to our server Jason.   I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Have had several great lunches here... good food, nice service and good ambiance. I'd rate lunches 5 stars.  However last night, a Monday, we went to celebrate a birthday and while the waitress was attentive, the delivery of our dinner was extremely slow to the point we joked about leaving to go home and eat leftovers. The small kitchen couldn't keep up with number of patrons and this spoiled our experience. I'll be slow to recommend for dinner, but it was great for lunch. Food was great, but because of slow delivery, I'd rate last night 3 stars."}
{"text":"My husband did the leg work to find this beautiful and cozy restaurant for brunch.  As you walk into a gated entry surrounded by trees and a very romantic ambiance you are greeted to be seated either inside or outside in a very serene environment.  With birds chirping and a fountain in the back your eyes are led to the bicycles propped against the wall and the lovely space above for guests to stay the night.  The restaurant boasts of honest craft and they do just that.  I had the Polpo made with lemon marinated ceci, calabrese chile butter, rucola and fennel insalata, balsamico and to share my husband and I had the brown butter french toast made with noble bread, toffee, cinammon pears and marscapone.  He had the pork ragu with marscapone polenta, fried eggs, salsa verde and noble toast.  Each bite of our food was decadent and full of thought and flavor.  I would highly recommend having either brunch or dinner in this super cute establishment to set the tone for a wonderful day ahead."}
{"text":"NOT a CHAIN RESTAURANT!!! 
Amazing Unique Food! Stellar Service!
Fabulous Bar & Wine Service.
Try the Grilled Asparagus with Candied Bacon! Delish! We also ordered the Grilled Octopus with Chick Peas and Lemon which has a unique layer of flavors and brightness.
We tried the Squid Ink Pasta and Seared Scallops and couldnt believe the flavors that the charming and polite Chef Gio can incorporate into these marvelous dishes!
Afterwards we tried every single dessert on the menu, courtesy of Chef Gio. (Not sure how we got so lucky that night!!)  I honestly couldnt choose a favorite because they were all so delicious! They were definitely worth the calories! The cremes and cakes and ice creams were probably the best I have ever tasted in any of my travels.
Would I go back? In a heartbeat! This is hands down the best restaurant in the state!"}
{"text":"We chose Virtu based on Yelp reviews and the pictures. I am attaching a photo of the scallops and you can compare to previous pictures posted by patrons. NO COMPARISON. A huge letdown actually, and the $72 wine can be bought for $22 in a wine shop. I believe most places mark it up one hundred percent? This seemed excessive but maybe that's why they are rated at $$$. The waitress was nice and we watched a total lunar eclipse from the patio, which was cool. Maybe we will come back for the next eclipse.. but not for the food."}
{"text":"So sad to write a review like this for what used to be one of our favorite restaurants.. we made a reservation for my birthday for a party of 15 but when my husband called to confirm they had double booked our table.. we agreed to Change the time but when we called to double check the night before they had once again double booked our time... most people would cancel at this point but we decided to hold on to the reservation thinking the food would make it worthwhile.. unfortunately the dinner tonight was a disappointment all around. We have always had good service but our server tonight was rude and unfriendly ... whereas normally the food is amazing, tonight the food was a disappointment. 
We ordered every appetizer on the menu... the octopus was overcooked And much too smoky, the rabbit gnocchi was blah, the marrow was over salted..
The salads were alright but the burrata was great.  As far as entrees the scallops were good (they always have been) but the fish was over salted and overdone.. the pork chop had good reviews from the men and was well cooked as was the steak. 
Sadly it was the overall experience that ruined this restaurant for us... from the poor planning with reservations to the unfriendly service and finally mediocre food ..."}
{"text":"Virtu was so excellent. The service from Matthew was amazing and really shaped our dinner experience at virtu. 

Matthew went above and beyond to explain the menu and offer recommendations to us and really shared his appreciation of food with us. 

It was our first time dining here and everything we ordered with the help of Matthew was amazing. The octopus, scallops, chicken, and salted Carmel toffee cake were out of this world. 

The octopus wasn't chewy at all and are definitely a must. 

The scallops practically melted in your mouth with how soft they were and the flavor palette was so satisfying. 

The chicken had the best flavor and the toasted crispy kale on top was so delicious. 

It was my fiancé's birthday and we got a dessert on the House. The salted caramel gelato on top of the toffee chocolate cake was tasty and not too sweet. The sweetness level was perfectly balanced just like every other part of the meal.

I definitely recommend virtu for date nights or special occasions. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Virtu for brunch at 1pm on a Saturday. 

1. When we phoned to see availability, had a bizarre voice mail. Thankfully I went on Open Table to secure a reservation. When we arrived, there were only two other tables present, and we were still asked if we had a reservation. A little weird that no one answered the phone with only two tables. Suggestion- don't waste your time calling, just reserve to CYA on Open Table.

2. Morning cocktails are incredible. We ordered the bourbon drink and the gin drink. Deciding was challenging but the server was helpful.  If you like your drinks to be of a respectable caliber, this is your jam. 

3. We ordered the burrata which was a great combination of flavors. Spicy poached eggs was next. If you have celiacs disease, I wouldn't even attempt to share this. We tried but my sad fork could barely scoop up any of the tomato egg goodness. Left this dish for the boyfriend to swoop in with beautifully toasted artisan bread slices.  Since I was still craving protein, we ordered the peperonata & potato hash.  This was incredible and left one measly bite of potato. Portions are a nice size and it is very fun to share.  The menu on the website is a sample-- really it shows the style of food you'll be treated to."}
{"text":"An amazing meal. I started off with asparagus, topped with an egg, candied bacon, feta cheese, hollandaise sauce and truffle oil. It was de-lic-i-ous! My husband had grilled octopus with a chili sauce- he said the 'pus was tender and tasty. I then had the squid ink pasta with octopus - yum! And my husband had the Bronzino; he said the skin was crispy while the fish was still soft and tender. Dessert was a dual creme brûlée: one white choc and one semi-sweet choc with three choc truffles and salted caramel. Are you drooling yet? The service was friendly and efficient. The meal was well paced. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Virtu and give it the 5 stars I heard it deserved. At best, I give it a 3.5. 

1) wine list is not very deep. They play up their hand crafted cocktails, but their wine list is disappointing.

2) service was pretty disappointing on a weekend. Flat out disappointing.

3) octopus- fantastic.

4) main dishes: duck/steak- I love culinary flavor, however, the flavor profiles were not prepared in a way that I would describe as life changing.

I saw pictures, and think I need to give it another shot. I will return- and hopefully have a better report."}
{"text":"Virtù far exceeded my expectations tonight. I started with the Ice Queen....YUM! I could've had 5. It was THAT good. My boyfriend and I started with the gnocchi which was perfect in texture, just velvety with just the right touch of sweetness. For my entree I had the Halibut, it was light but did not lack in the flavor department. Tonight's dinner left me excited for my next visit."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant. Great environment, friendly staff and food to die for."}
{"text":"Once again a fabulous meal. The octopus is still sublime. The pig's ears are amazing. The short ribs
were succulent. The toffee cake is to die for. The service is friendly and professional. The music is soft. This is upscale dining at its best. By the way the wine list while not extensive is nice quality and the coffee is really good. I highly recommend. One more thing, they willingly answered our multiple questions, always a good sign."}
{"text":"So delicious. My beloved lunch companions said they had the best grilled cheese of their lives. I had the veggie crepe and the vegetables were perfect, still crisp, completely fresh. We also tried the signature drink--strawberry and black pepper, as well as the peach iced tea. Perfect for a hot, dry day; the best sunday brunch. I would love to return."}
{"text":"nO NO nO NO nO

I bet you thought that read ho no oh no oh no huh? The mind is weird.

This place has very poor service and charges a lot for food that is very much lacking. The service though is what really killed it. They gave us 1 server for 12 people! WTF?


The Lambshank was pretty good though.

That being said there is absolutely no reason to go to a place like this in a town full of amazing restaurants that have decent service and actually care that you are there."}
{"text":"A true hidden gem in Old Town! Just about a minute walk from Salty's Senorita & R&R. This is literally a great place for brunch. There's tons of free parking right outside. The ambiance is very intimate and 

The servers were very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. The menu changes every once in a while but I ordered the famous Grilled Octopus (seems like a lot of people mentioned it in their reviews), brown butter french toast, chistorra and eggs and sticky toffee cake. There's really nothing I can say about them except YOU HAVE TO TRY THEM. It's literally heaven on earth. I would rate this place 6 out of 5 stars if I could... 

Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food at Virtu is very good and the location is excellent. The menu is short - about a half dozen starters and entrees, and 3 desserts. We tried the grilled octopus starter, the squid ink linguine with octopus and the smoked duck. We followed-up with a visit that included the two octopus dishes again. All were excellent. The linguine with red sauce and garlic was really good... A+. The signature octopus starter is good... but when compared to say the octopus at Mediterranean Explorations Company in Portland... it pales in comparison, and seems to try too hard. But why quibble? It's good. The desserts and cocktails have all been in the great category - with a grappa and grape cocktail on the front side, and a mascarpone ice cream with balsamic red figs to finish. On the latest visit both the cocktails and desserts were A+ again. Things developed slowly through the evening - any slower it would have been an issue. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place has stolen my heart. It will always be known as the first date restaurant for me and my guy. It was our first time during restaurant week and loved the charming decor, low lighting and excellent service. It reminded us of sweet little Portland restaurants. 2 years later, I selected this place for my Check Please, AZ audition...and was chosen for a segment! It aired earlier this year and was so glad that such a local gem was able to showcase their talent. Unfortunately for us, the secret is out! 

You must try the cocktails (ALL OF THEM) preferably the Ice Queen (vodka, my drink of choice), anything with bourbon in it and the wine selection is extensive and fantastic. Pricey, but fantastic, the scallops with corn 5 ways and the squid with chickpeas. The dishes are plated beautifully and the servers are great at recommending items if you have never dined with them before.

You can tell that the chefs take great care in the food they are putting out there and of course it is all cooked to perfection. Seasoning, sauces, sides were all scrumptious. It's in a great little spot next to the Bespoke Inn. Even though we are locals (I am a Native Arizonan) it makes you want to stay at the inn so you get to enjoy the restaurant for one more day."}
{"text":"Would have been a 5 star review except our waiter disappeared towards the dinner course. And the outside bench was very uncomfortable. However the food was amazing!!!  The halibut collar was one of the best plates I have ever had!  Cant wait to return."}
{"text":"The antidote to scottsdale douchiness.  Their cocktail program is top of the line and so is the food.  Get the grilled octopus."}
{"text":"A must try!  Service, impeccable.  Food, fabulous. Overall, impressive.  This James Beard award gem is a culinary delight.  With a quaint European vibe, the menus offerings are seasonal.  They offer hand crafted cocktails and a nice wine pairing selection. We started with a \"trio\" a pick three selection of tapas, followed by entrees.  Everything we tried was amazing!  This is one of my new favorite places in Scottsdale, looking forward to going again soon."}
{"text":"Great intimate yet lively vibe and really great food.  The polpo and steak tartare were the highlights."}
{"text":"Went to Virtu with a friend for brunch. Amazing crepe and side of fruit. I hope to go back soon! It was also a super cute little place. Wonderful service - very kind employees."}
{"text":"Saw their menu on restaurant week and decided to go tonight for our 39th wedding anniversary. What an absolutely wonderful place for a special occasion. First, before we arrived I started receiving text reminders about my reservation, and then received a confirmation call. When we arrived we were warmly welcomed and wished a happy anniversary from several staff. The service was attentive, the food was so special. Grilled octopus, smoked duck, and more. And to celebrate our anniversary we were given two different glasses of wine to compliment the duck, two glasses of champagne, and a dessert for us to share, all on the house. This is a great place we will be retuning to. The menu changes sometimes daily depending on what is locally fresh. This is not food, it's cuisine and art. It's a small place inside with a large patio which is larger than the indoor seating is. The patio is beautiful. In one word Perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Bugs (yes, bugS, plural) were in my $13 reverse old fashioned.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"Best meal I had in Scottsdale hands down. Best octopus I've ever had. Period. And that chicken. Step one. Order the ice queen. Step two. Order the octopus. Step three. Order the burrata. Step four. Order the chicken. Step five. Repeat the next night???"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I was blown away. We had the octopus and asparagus to start - both amazing. I had the lamb ragu pappardelle and it is some of the best pasta I have ever had. For the quality of food and ambiance of the restaurant, it is priced so well. They also gave a free dessert for my birthday. We got sticky toffee pudding as per our waiter's suggestion and I usually do not like toffee but this was so good! Our waiter was incredible. Everyone was so attentive to us without being intrusive or overly checking in. They have a changing menu and I cannot wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"The menu was very well conceptualized. The appetizers of burrata, tuna crudo and asparagus were great. Unfortunately my prime NY strip steak was over cooked twice. It was recommended by the waiter to come out medium rare but was served medium well even after I sent back to the kitchen and waited another 20 minutes for them to over cook it again. It was also served with a dry polenta cake that was lacking flavor. The funny part was no visit from management to the table. They took care of one of our appetizers and not the steak that was prepared incorrectly. Should have been awesome but missed the mark on the execution and recovery."}
{"text":"This review is based on our limited experience, as we stopped by for dessert and sat at the bar. We needed a sweet treat, and a nightcap of a drink. It was a busy night. We were greeted by Jeremy at the bar, and he really made the experience 5 stars. Friendly,  knowledgeable about the menu, different drinks, gave us info on Scottsdale, and he was equally engaging with us while working. We had the Budino and Sticky Toffee cake. Wow! The cake was spectacular, so moist and delicious in flavor. Order this! We sipped on Limoncello & Frangellico with our desserts, and just enjoyed the nice atmosphere of the restaurant.
A really nice find on Yelp for us, just wish we had come back for a full dinner service. But we loved this experience, and appreciated the great service by Jeremy. Read the other reviews, then go enjoy it for yourself."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful place and food, but snobby atmosphere that we are not used to dealing with, despite coming from a large east coast city with more award winning restaurants than you can count. We ordered all the most recommended dishes, including octopus, asparagus, pigs ears, and short ribs, and each was delicious and beautifully presented. However, the restaurant was generally uninterested in accommodating the palates of our two small kids, though the one option we had (spaghetti with red sauce) turned out to be a hit. In fact, the tenor with which we were received at the restaurant only turned positive once we placed our order for a bottle of wine, which made us wonder if they assumed we were not likely to order a substantial meal. We were also told that there were no reservations other than 5:00, and then found ourselves dining alone for about an hour before others arrived-which again left us wondering if we were only offered an early option because we were with kids. Not sure, and again, it worked out ok for us, but this is not necessarily the easiest place to bring children. Coming from a city where fine dining does not mean excluding children, we thought our experience here was worth noting."}
{"text":"The husband and I went here for restaurant week last Friday and I must say that I was very impressed. I have been wanting to try this place for a long time, so when I saw their menu for RW I made a reservation right away. We started with a complimentary cocktail (mango sorbet in prosecco) and it was very tasty and refreshing. For appetizers, the husband got the lamb polpette with feta sauce... so delicious.. these little meatballs were packed with flavor, and I got the octopus panzanella. Now, I have had octopus before and didn't care for it, but I wanted to give it another chance. This was very good. The sauce they served it with and the herbs were wonderful! My only issue with the dish was that the bread was really tough and hard to cut (I ended up tearing it with my hands... not very lady like, but you gotta do what you gotta do). This octopus was far better than the first time I had tried it... I still don't think I am an octopus lover, but I did like it. For entrees, the husband got the pork chop and I had the steak. The pork chop was huge... I mean super huge. It was also tasty. He said it was was the best pork chop he'd ever had and, to quote him, it was 'comfort food elevated.' The steak was perfectly cooked and the chimichurri was delicious... very bright and herbacious. It came with a potato hash of sorts with a duck egg on top, cheese curds, and gravy.... sort of like a poutine. It was also amazingly delicious, but so rich I couldn't eat it all. For dessert we split the peanut butter and chocolate cake and the mascarpone ice cream with figs... the chocolate cake was a little on the dry side for me, but the ice cream was incredible... would eat that over and over! We also had coffee, and, though it was very good coffee, I wish we had gotten a refill.  I would definitely like to come back here again. 


PS the service here was perfect, attentive, friendly, but not invasive... just great. 


PPS you can tell how fancy a restaurant is by how many words in the review are underlined in red because the computer thinks they're spelled wrong... this place is pretty fancy :-P"}
{"text":"Yum! What a terrific little find! We are total foodies, in Scottsadale from San Francisco for the week, so of course had to see if the hype was true. It is! Great little place, lovely patio with heater lamps, terrific service & yes, everything else people are saying about the cocktails & food quality is not exaggerated. I decided to go the small plate route, thinking I'd order 2-3 appys instead of a main course to sample more things. But the portions were  quite large & two was plenty!  ( and I can eat!). I had the octopus ( charred to tasty perfection ) and the pork roulette (sp?) which was like a cold pate of sorts, with crostini & all sorts of interesting spreads & pickled yummies to add to it. I ended up dining alone this time, as my husband got stuck late at a conference. His loss! I was fully engrossed with my food, drink & the chatty staff for a good 2 hours & never even really noticed - LOL . Shhh! The place is really reasonably priced for the food quality, the wine list had many options under $12 & the like cocktails were tasty. Ask for patio seating if its a nice place. Highly recommend. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"When I tried virtu it was incredible I got the forty ounce steak it was amazing like it was so juicy so many delicious flavors rushed in my mouth every one should get it ."}
{"text":"This place was quiet and near empty when we came in for Sunday brunch which would lead me to believe that it was not good but what a hidden gem! This was probably one of the best brunch me and my 4 girlfriends have had! I got the crepe which was full of ham and cheese it was so tasty I basically licked my plate.  There were so many tasty options on the menu so it was difficult to decide but classic crepe was the right choice!!"}
{"text":"First the cocktails. Wow!! They have every ingredient for a cocktail you can think of. The food is just as amazing."}
{"text":"Went to Virtu Honest Craft twice last week - and both times had a fabulous experience. On Wed night, sat at the bar and had some phenomenal cocktails while talking mixology with the very friendly and knowledgeable bartender. Each of the complex drinks was perfectly balanced and was made with fresh, high quality ingredients. We also had a wonderful dessert. The service was so comfortable and cordial..... so we returned for brunch Fri morning and WOW!!! The food was so creative, so well presented - and the flavors were simply amazing. We have eaten at many restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area over the years - but none can beat this place. A must go if you're a cocktail-loving foodie!!!"}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite spots in Scottsdale! Can't believe this gem was right in my backyard and I had no idea. I recommend close to everything as far as dishes go. But I must say, I keep going back for that pasta! Beautiful outdoor seating with heaters. I also love their old fashion cocktail- so good."}
{"text":"SOOOO happy to have found this place! Was doing a brunch search in Scottsdale for my Mom's upcoming birthday. Found Virtu.. the menu looked good, had a perfect reservation time available... so we booked it! I was expecting a good place but this is my new favorite brunch place in Scottsdale. The staff was SUPER friendly and quick to get to your table. The drinks were delicious - two of us had bloody marys and really it's the best one I've ever had. Wowza. All four of us had separate entrees - and all of us couldn't shovel it down fast enough. Ingredients were fresh, great portions, the flavors while interesting and not always what you'd typically expect, were spot on. I just can't say enough great things about Virtu. It was perfect down to the seating... We sat out on their adorable little patio this past Saturday... couldn't have asked for a better setting. So if (when) you visit Virtu, try a Bloody Mary and get the Pork Ragu... then hop on here and thank me. ;)"}
{"text":"This is absolutely hands down the best restaurant experience I have had in the valley! Chef Gio is amazing and the food that the staff puts out is decadent!  My husband and I treated ourselves to dinner here last night for our anniversary, after we saw the chef doing a demonstration at AJ's a year ago. Our waiter Scott was top notch, explained all of the dishes extremely well.  They do a great job with the craft mixers..we started with one of those and then went on to a fab bottle of Frank Cab to enjoy the appetizers with.  They have 7 or 8 small tapas to start with and we tried 4 of them. All of them excellent!  The next dish we had was the grilled octopus which I believed is shipped in from Spain.  Never had this tasty of octopus and it was a full dish.  Next course was the main course and hubs had the smoked duck and I enjoyed the buccatini pasta.  Not big plates but enough to satisfy any food cravings.  
The establishment is small, very intimate and bar seating is limited so get there early if you want a seat at the bar.  This was a Wednesday night and we had reservations and each table was taken 6pm. When the weather is cooler there is outdoor patio seating as well.  The Bespoke Inn is upstairs and they are closed for the summer but open most of the year.
We loved this place and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Truly a 5-star experience! Visited for restaurant week while celebrating with my honey. This place changed my entire opinion of asparagus. I didn't know that cheese, a duck egg, bacon, and whatever magic they work in the kitchen could transform one of my least favorite vegetables into one of the most memorable dishes I've ever eaten. The menu rotates seasonally, so it's probably more useful just to tell you to visit and enjoy the creativity and lovely ambiance (dinner especially) with small candles and lights in the trees. Loved every bite!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a beautiful mother's day brunch prepared by some amazing chefs! Great service and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Brunch this past weekend was so extraordinary, I was compelled to sign up on Yelp so I could express my gratitude.  My girlfriend actually argued that we should keep this find to ourselves in hopes of preserving its charm.  Judging by the other reviews I've just read, I think it's safe to say the secret is out.  Absolutely delightful, can't wait to return for dinner.  Thank you for such a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Just had our second meal here and it was even better the second time.  The food is creative, but not obscure.  All the flavors are wonderful and the staff are incredibly knowledgeable about the food and drinks.  The Brussel salad is amazing, as is the grilled octopus and burrata.   Great spot for a date or evening with friends."}
{"text":"When exquisite Chef Gio Osso and craft cocktail pioneer Clint \"Spotty\" Spotleson join forces- expect nothing but amazing, honest craft to emanate. And, literally, the restaurant is called Virtu Honest Craft. 
Food and cocktail menus are constantly changing and evolving; the evening I was there I dined on ahi tuna tartare with | smoked onion mustard | garlic toast and then moved on to Smoked Duck with | cashew tabouleh | amarena cherry demi. I had a bite of a friends delectable dessert which was fresh grilled peaches and a delightful dollop of fresh cheese.
NOW, on to the cocktails. Words fail to describe the unique and creative approach Spotty takes in creating his craft cocktails, and this is very evident in his beverage program at the bar inside Virtu Honest Craft. From the Mule Fresco w smoked rosemary & honey comb, to an inventive crisp Grappa cocktail w Cabernet syrup garnished w fresh red grapes...all served in appropriate respective glassware. 
Make time to check out this gem, and bring your friends. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Easter Sunday was our third time here and it wasn't as memorable as it had been in the past. It was a beautiful day and it certainly was nice to sit outside in their nice garden but the service and food were just okay. I must say my mother enjoyed the ricotta pancakes and the portion was just enough for her but if you're hungry the portion might be considered small especially at the price point of $12.00 for 2 medium sized pancakes. I ordered the grilled cheese with prosciutto and fig jam which was tasty but the prosciutto must have been mashed up in it because neither could you taste it or see it; I guess I was expecting thinly sliced strips of prosciutto for $13.00. The arugula and fennel salad was nice with a light dressing. My husband had chistorra (sausage) and eggs which he said was mostly potatoes for $14.00. The coffee wasn't bad since it wasn't bitter but it was weak. Our server seemed to have an attitude but he was prompt with making sure we refills on coffee and water without having to ask. Doubt we will return with so many other places in the valley to try."}
{"text":"Virtu is a place where the food always surprises me, because no matter what I might think when I read the menu, it always comes together beautifully and deliciously.  You can really see and taste the attention to detail in each dish.  We've been for brunch during the weekdays as well as for dinner.  Their everyday brunch menu should not be missed!

Favorites from brunch:  noble bread French toast, pancakes, pork ragu, crepe.  The portions are great--we never leave hungry.  My husband had a fantastic duck entree, while I had squid ink pasta with octopus made to look like bolognese, which was a masterful play in texture, taste, and color.

Staff is attentive, friendly, and helpful!"}
{"text":"1) Watered down coffee 2) Very small portions (especially for the price) 3) Skimpy on protein / meat (heavy on carbs) 4) Octopus was gross (love seafood, but this tasted rotten) 5) Poor service. Made a comment that the one dish was not very good and waiter ignored it (didn't even respond) and never came back to our table. Was excited to try a new place for brunch with a group of folks, but left completely disappointed. This place looked nice and quaint online. The only thing it has going is the cute patio (minus the flies)."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food! Was perfect for a Sunday brunch with my girlfriend! Setting it absolutely beautiful and lush. Wine selection was also more than we could have asked for."}
{"text":"Easter Sunday morning and a very delicious brunch menu. I believe it is their regular Sunday brunch menu, so you may enjoy these tidbits all year long. We started with a gracious hello, competent and very friendly waitstaff, and a few beverages. Their cocktails are dynamite and the beer selection was very nice for a small-ish place. As recommended by our waitress, we started with the char-grilled octopus. Oh My Yum. This was tender, flavorful, and perfectly grilled. We loved the accompanying salad and dressing as well. My daughter had the lemon ricotta pancakes (delectably sweet and tasty). Her fiance had the grilled cheese sammy - great bread (Noble) that I would have again and again and again. Hubby had the pork dish with gooey egg on top - the best meal on the table! And I had the French Toast - again with Noble Bread and perfectly done. We splurged on the chocolate date cake afterwards, with a scoop of the sorbet. All in all - SO DAMN GOOD! I will be back for more."}
{"text":"A great bartender at a bourbon house pointed us to this restaurant. No reservations were available but very lucky for us they had a spot for 2 that allowed us to enjoy the most incredible meal ever.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who can appreciate the talents of a chef who thinks outside the box!  We enjoyed the Octopus starter, the gnocchi were beyond amazing and our entree - Swordfish cheek served on a bone was the most incredible plate we have ever been served. OMG delicious and a one of a kind memory I will carry with me"}
{"text":"I wanted so much to love this restaurant. I received a gift card for Christmas from a friend who purported this to be his favorite spot. So my husband and I decided to celebrate my birthday with what we hoped would be an excellent meal before taking in the Vanessa Williams concert. 

It started out fine: we arrived really early for our reservation and they still seated us, cheerfully - always a good sign. 

The drink menu is clever, funny actually (my husband wanted to take pictures). I chose the Ice Queen, which was potent and beautifully fru-fru; my husband opted for beer, the Brooklyn Lager, about which he raved. The food menu is unique and well curated, with just enough options. Had the execution and service matched the menus we would have been thrilled. No such luck.

Although our server, Tatiana, was pleasant enough, she was super slow and very disorganized. More than five minutes to greet us, easily twenty minutes to receive our cocktails (worth the wait, but still, come on). After we received our drinks, I'm pretty sure she forgot about us until the table next to us was seated, then she finally took our dinner order. 

We ordered the pate as an appetizer to share, my husband ordered the pork chops, and I decided on the scallops. The pate was DELICIOUS! So much so that my husband requested additional bread to finish it up. And that, I believe, was our undoing. Thirty minutes, and I wish I was exaggerating, to receive five pieces of crusty bread, for which they either held our order - or Tatiana forgot to turn it in.

We were prepared for a leisurely meal, but this was just irresponsible. I told my husband I thought something was up because our server was suddenly avoiding eye contact, even when she was serving our neighbors.

The entrees themselves proved to be as unbalanced as the service. My husband enjoyed his pork chops, indicating they were properly cooked, except at the bone - understandable. Conversely, my scallops were perfect texturally, but so salty as to be almost inedible. I was so hungry though, that I smothered them with the crispy lentils to absorb some of the salt, and gulped tons of water. Even at that, I was only able to eat two of the three.

To contrast the service we received, our neighbors, who arrived about thirty minutes after us, were finishing their dessert by the time we received our entrees. I, fortunately, had the foresight to request our check as soon as we received our entrees, otherwise we would have missed the beginning of the show. Interestingly, collecting the payment was Tatiana's timeliest act of the evening.

A couple of things: it was clear to everyone (our neighbors, the food runners and bus staff, our server) that there was a problem; however, no one stepped up to make it right. No correction. No manager intervention. Lots of eateries do well when things go smoothly, but the true measure of a really good restaurant is how they react when the wheels fall off. Good service can make up for a lot; poor service can negate a lot of good. This was a service fail."}
{"text":"Brunch here is anything but ordinary. The grilled octopus was visually stunning. I love that  citrus balances the spiciness of this dish just perfectly. The affogato was out of this world. A little jewel hidden in old town Scottsdale for sure."}
{"text":"Octopus cut like butter and tasted great. Asparagus was equally as good. Service way above Par. 
Six stars if I could."}
