{"text":"Had an excellent lunch again and the food was great. We always love the black eyed pea salad. The service was great too !"}
{"text":"I love Letty's. It's very good food with warm and welcoming service.  None of that pretentious foodie bs that seems more and more rampant in restaurants that aren't even that good (ugh don't get me started). They just obviously put a lot of care into what they do. Everything I've had is good, and that includes the creole, veggie wrap, honey pecan chicken, and most of their sides. Always fresh, hot, and flavorful."}
{"text":"Tried Letty's for lunch on Saturday.  Chose from the brunch menu--salmon cakes with grits--and was pleasantly surprised by the meal portions.  The salmon cakes were large, flavorful and rich, though a tad dry (maybe a little too much bread crumb).  The grits...wow...honestly the best restaurant grits I've had in years.  They were creamy and retained their texture, had great seasoning and a nice dash of cheese on top (could go for some right now).  The plate also came with fluffy eggs, a few forkfuls of fresh fruit and a really tasty biscuit.  All said, the meal was the perfect size and a good value.  The table service was warm, the atmosphere was comfortable and the coffee was fab.  

It isn't easy to find a restaurant that feels like a neighborhood place but Letty's makes my list!  Looking forward to trying the dinner menu soon."}
{"text":"To die for. I sing the praises of Letty's to anyone who will listen. Amazing food and service! Pimiento cheese fritters and honey pecan chicken MUST be tried. Love love love!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant!  I want to write a good review for it, but I don't want too many people to know how great it is and it get too busy.  That wouldn't be fair to the owner though, so here goes - We've been there twice: once for brunch and once for dinner.  We were very happy at both meals.  The food was excellent and the staff was great.  We had the honey pecan chicken, the salmon and the pork chops at dinner.  Yum!  All 3 were very, very good.  The grits were fabulous at brunch.  I took my sister there for her birthday and she was very happy.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a great neighborhood restaurant.  The food is very reasonably priced and the waitstaff is always friendly. Breakfast is excellent if you just want basic bacon and eggs with biscuits. The food has greatness in its simplicity, don't look for any fancy dishes, just basic southern cooking and friendly charm."}
{"text":"I wished I lived closer to this place so I could go there more often. I really like the vibe. It's super 70's Southeast style. It's like a cross between the Regal Beagle and Louie's in the Bronx (where Michael Corleone gatted Captain McCluskey in the throat in \"the Godfather\") [trigger warning...I mean trigger apology footnote, I guess] I first heard about this place from some friends who live in the area and it looked so down-home comfort style that I decided to give it a try. I read that they offered cheesesteaks on the menu and when I called to order it I spoke directly with the cook who described it very well. The wait was a little long, but the atmosphere is old-school and pleasant, so while I waited for my food I enjoyed a bottled domestic which was on special. I have to say that it was one of the best cheesesteaks I ever had. The cheddar cheese on top of the provolone set it off, straight away. Even the fries were good (they were seasoned) and I don't usually eat fries. If you are in the area I highly recommend it for takeout or enjoy the ambiance for a quiet meal."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood hot spot!!  Always want to try new dishes but the country fried chicken is so delicious (and plentiful) that I can't resist!!  Really enjoy sitting out back when the weather is nice!!"}
{"text":"Had brunch, was good prices, good food, attentive service, unique atmosphere  which is a nice break from all the commercial restaurants in Charlotte. Desserts looked great but didn't try them. Potatoes were a bit too crispy and bland. Small and simple menu but hopefully that means they're good at what they do serve. 

A bit out of the way but worth the short drive. Find their coupons in Explore your Hood booklets."}
{"text":"Took my wife with me to try this place that was highly recommended by a good friend. My friends recommendation was correct. Its an older building with minimum exterior beautification. The interior would remind you of a good old mom & pop restaurant. The staff are really friendly and appear to enjoy working at Letty's. My tip: Give this place a try.  My wife had the fish and chips and enjoyed it.  I had the beef stroganoff with a side salad and balsamic vinaigrette.  Apparently the great tasting sauce was absorbed by the egg noodles.  I assumed this was just another version of the famous dish so I dug in.  The flavors were excellent.  I asked our waitress about my dish lacking the sauce I am accustomed to.  She stated she would check wih the chef and get right back to me.  To my surprise, Letty appeared at my table and looked at my dish and listened my feedback.  She agreed with me about the lack of sauce and confirmed my suspicions.  Letty came returned to the table with a side of fresh sauce for me to add as I pleased.  That did the trick.  Please don't mistake this as a complaint, because it isn't.  Each of our meals also came with a biscuit.  They were very tasty and the texture was perfect.  I used mine to soak up the remainder of my stroganoff sauce.  Letty returned again and got acquainted with us.  Through conversation Letty became aware I was from Louisiana and wife from Scotland.  We began discussing Cajun and Creole style dishes.  Well, it's my lucky day.  Letty is going to email me when she features Etouffee as a special.  Letty is prepared to impress me, because I revealed to her I never order Cajun or Creole style foods outside Louisiana because I've been disappointed too many times in the past.  I am anxious for Letty to restore my confidence in the near future.  I suggest giving this place a try.  After only meeting Letty once, I can tell she knows the business and is committed to succeed.  I will probably become a regular at Letty's  I wish to give a special shout out to our friend Jackie for recommending we try Letty's.  Thanks for the tip!"}
{"text":"Ready for another great meal! Really love the Portuguese Sizzling Shrimp! Always check to see what the chef special is for the day."}
{"text":"Excellent food with reasonable prices tucked away in the Plaza Shamrock neighborhood. We go here for date night or a few drinks. classic southern American food with vegetarian options and something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Just had beer & burgers @ Letty's. Burgers exceptional, as always. Service excellent. Fun, friendly, comfortable, casual. Real restaurant people!!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to stop in since this establishment became \"Letty's\". I just never seemed to be on Shamrock even though I live in Plaza-Midwood. I was a \"tester\" the week before the original, Pike's Soda Shop, opened and never went to Fososkie's. I only knew one Letty in the restaurant business, from the times I spent at Hotel Charlotte. I was curious. 

Today, I made the great choice to stop in. Indeed, it was THE Letty. It was great to see her and reminisce. 

I tried the special, a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. I was very impressed with what I chose. The addition of bleu cheese crumbles was a great compliment to the sauce. 

The place is much bigger than the original restaurant. It has a terrific comfortable feel to it. There are rooms big enough for a company event or other large party. It has a lunch counter/bar with craft beers and liquor for those who chose to imbibe. 

If you live in the P-M area, grab some friends and allow Letty to provide you with a memorable time. There just aren't a lot of places like this left in Charlotte. Invite folks who aren't in the area. They will soon find out it IS worth the drive. 

Thanks, Letty. It was good to see you. See ya again soon."}
{"text":"I have been here several times with friends who live in the area, not really by my choice. The food is decent, but the service is always terrible. Even when they are not busy, the service is slow. I have seen the owner be rude to other patrons, and there is not much positive personality in the place.  Also had some friends called derogatory names by the cooks when an order was prepared incorrectly and sent back. The cleanliness is also questionable.  I have never had a good experience here, and now even refuse to go along if my friends are going here. There are too many similar and good restaurants near this place to ever spend my hard earned money here."}
{"text":"A trip to Letty's is mandatory for all my trips to Charlotte.  Great food, great atmosphere...well worth a visit"}
{"text":"Fast service, home like unpretentious atmosphere, good for families.  We had  3 adults in our party,  started with Fried green tomatoes, crunchy  not greasy good flavor, will have them again. I had Honey Pecan chicken, excellent,moist and had a great yummy batter. I had a  side of excellent crisp fresh tasting fried okra!  OMG the best I have ever had.  Others had bourbon Salmon. cooked perfect. moist Great  Huge servings!  Did not have room for dessert. in General , excellent cleanliness rating, place was clean and service friendly and quick."}
{"text":"New, quaint. Salads, sandwiches, entrees. I had Sirloin Cheesesteak. Not bad, served on Portuguese roll with delicious potato wedges. Bread was delicious. Friend had Pimiento Grilled Cheeseburger with Fried Okra. He liked it. Said Okra was like popcorn. It did look good. Home made soups. Entrees look good. Large and small serving options. Menu is small but is diverse. Shrimp Creole, Honey Pecan Chicken, \"Neatloaf\"(veggie), Salmon, and a couple other entrees. Fried Green Tomatoes, hummus. Iced tea needs some work. Sunday brunch. Closed Monday. Less than $20 including tip for both of us.

Great service. Decent prices. Next to Pikes Pharmacy."}
{"text":"Pimento fritters were really good.

I don't recall what our meal was, but I remember it was decent. Want to give this place another try."}
{"text":"Love it! My favs are the Pimento Cheese Fritters for an appetizer, Fried Chicken Tenders over Charleston Cheddar Grits and any of the desserts! Or the Carolina Dog, or the Pimento Cheese Burger."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we had a Restaurant.com gift certificate.

The decor is homey...the staff is super friendly...very quaint place in the middle of seemingly nowhere.

We ordered the humachos as an appetizer.  Quite possibly the best thing I've ever eaten.  I will be going back just to get them again.  We were warned to get the smaller meal portions if we wanted the humachos and we got the larges anyway.  Needless to say, lunch the next day was delicious.  We ate the fish and chips and the blackened chicken pasta.  Both were pretty good, but the humachos were the reason we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Letty's, a southern-style restaurant in the heart of the Midwood region of Charlotte. This neighborhood eatery offers comfort food in a homey environment where everyone is welcomed.

Dora here. True. Letty made her way around the dining room, chatting with patrons, several times during our visit. What Letty's lacked in ambiance, they more than made up for in cleanliness, friendliness, and good service. Probably a local favorite. When I mentioned that it was a bit dark, hubby chimed in with romantic. That's my guy.:)

As a starter, we ordered Pimiento Cheese Fritters, panko-battered and fried, and served with Letty's tomato jam. The fritters were great, crispy on the outside but smooth and creamy on the inside. When dipped into the cool and sweet tomato jam, perfect!

Dora here. Tomatoes and pimento? How did Ernie ever convince me to order this? lol. Actually, the fritters were a great start. I had high hopes.:)

The server recommended Shrimp & Grits. Grilled shrimp served over sausage gravy and topped with grits, crumbled bacon and cheddar jack cheese. This dish was loaded with shrimp and cheese, and the combination blended so well together, I will definitely try this again.

Dora here. Our server also recommended the Honey Pecan Chicken, which sounded right up my foodie alley. Maybe because I'm trying to eat healthier, the chicken was a bit too sweet for my taste, almost like candy, and most of the options for sides were carb-heavy. That said, check out the generous portions, and what a great value at only $10.

Fellas, if you're looking for a romantic spot to wow your sweetheart, this probably isn't the place. But if you're looking for down-home cooking at a great value, head to Letty's.

What's your favorite southern-style cooking restaurant? 

We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog

{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Everyone liked the food they had. I had salmon & it was yummy. Homemade fried okra was spot on. We will eat there again sometime."}
{"text":"I can only speak for their brunch menu. I'll say that it was incredibly reasonably priced, and it sounded exciting. After much debate I decided on a traditional eggs Benedict, which is one of my favorite breakfast dishes. I had high hopes, and I was unfortunately disappointed. The eggs were over cooked, so it was more of boiled then poached egg. They were quite sparing with the under seasoned hollandaise sauce. The grits were a little on the watery side for my taste. I really wanted to like this place, but I just couldn't after I tried the brunch. If it was possible to give 2&1/2 stars I would, because the food wasn't terrible, but it was bland. The service was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Ate at Letty's last week for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed the visit! Letty was our waitress and she's so down to earth and sweet! I had pecan chicken, which was perfectly juicy and moist & the pimento cheese balls were amazing!"}
{"text":"Perfect staff! Lovely food! Casual neighborhood atmosphere! Great place!"}
{"text":"Went to Letty's this evening for our once a month in house dining.  My daughters and I make this a special treat.  We love Letty's.. both the foo itd and atmosphere.  However, as often as we come, we feel we are treated like strangers.  Things started well but as soon as the meal arrived, there was no check back until we were nearly finished.  Half way through the meal, I was going to order another glass of wine but by the time someone came, I was finished eating.  My daughters and myself all have worked in the restaurant business during our college days so we are particularly sensitive to issues that come up during a shift.  Perhaps less socializing at individual tables for 10-15 minutes at a time and circulating among all tables would produce a sense that all customers are equally important and their needs are met as well."}
{"text":"I eat out a LOT.  I travel for my job and when I'm home...well, let's just say that my other half and I do not have similar tastes in food so, it is easier to go out than to cook.  At many of these restaurants, a manager will come by with the ubiquitous, \"is everything okay\", not really getting or receiving an honest response.  I'm used to this and I never really gave it much thought.  Until I went to Letty's.  I got the UnMeatloaf (I'm a vegetarian) and the \"Mister\" got fish and chips.  Mine came with broccolli casserole (more casserole than broccolli but good) and mashed potatoes (yum!).  I am not ashamed to say I scraped the plate to get every single bit of my meal.  It was TASTY.  Mister enjoyed his potato wedges (as evidenced by their quick removal from his plate) but wasn't a huge fan of the fish.  The menu said \"beer battered\" but he said he could taste the beer.  I found that a bit odd but...okay.  So, back to the \"is everything okay\" part of our story.  As we were finishing our dinner, the owner (Letty) came by the table and asked how we enjoyed the meal.  My response was obvious, I had nothing left on my plate!  Mister said it was okay.  Then, the unusual happened.  She actually looked at what was left on his plate and asked if he had not liked the fish.  He told her about the beer taste and she mentioned that it was beer battered.  He said he understood but just wasn't a big fan.  So....she takes the plates away and comes back with our bill and says that she could not let him pay for a meal he didn't enjoy and that she took it off, hoping that he would come back again and try something else.  I was flabbergasted.  An owner/manager who actually cares what someone thinks?  Wow.  Needless to say, yes, we will go back and we will try something else and we will keep doing so until Mister is happy.  (Actually, reading the reviews on here, I think the Honey Pecan Chicken will be next on the list!)"}
{"text":"Awesome dinning experience.  I had the honey pecan chicken and my sister had the shrimp alfredo. The fried pimento cheese bites were my favorite part of the meal. I have 2 small complaints. Wish my mac & cheese  had the elbow noodles and my fried okra did taste too salty as I was finishing it up. The chocolate cake was good. The coconut pie was good but better the next day cold. I definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It's unlike the \"chains\" as it is owner operated by Miss Letty herself. From the second I walked in the door, I felt like a \"VIP\". We started out with amazing bloody Mary's and then ordered eggs Benedict with hash browns. It was served hot and sooo tasty! The portions are a good size and even though we had a group of 15, we were all served at the same time. Letty has daily specials which are delicious and interesting. You have to try Lettys !!"}
{"text":"Loved this little diamond in the rough. Glad I stopped and experienced Lettys. The restaurant itself is small but welcoming. Our waitress was very pleasant and was honest about menu choices. The food was pretty good. I had the pecan/honey chicken which was cooked perfectly. I would have preferred more seasoning on the chicken but it was still tasty. I also had the broccoli casserole and Mac and cheese both were a little on the greasy side but flavorful. My dining partner had some type of pasta (don't remember the name) that he enjoyed. The highlight of the dinner was Letty herself who brought out our food and was charming and pleasant. I will definitely go back. 

SN-The restaurant is easy to pass so make sure to pay attn when nearing your destination."}
{"text":"Like Peggy, I really wanted this place to be great. On my visit, it was a-ok but not quite great.  Hopefully they will get there.  

Since this is really far outside of my work & home neighborhood, I don't make it over to this side of town very often. However, I recently found myself in the neighborhood around lunch-time, so I stopped in to grab a quick lunch.

When I walked in the door, I found the set-up of the place to be a bit awkward. However, I didn't have to wait but for a minute to be seated.  

The menu features a lot of southern favorites and I really wanted to try the Pimento cheese fritters.  However, since I was by myself, I decided to skip the appetizer. 

I decided to try the shrimp creole.  It was ok, but honestly, not the best I have had in town.  The shrimp was sautéed and served in a traditional creole sauce over rice, but it was just a bit on the bland side. One nice thing is that they offer this in a half-sized order for $7.50 or a full sized order for $10. 

(I think, based on some of the other reviews, that I should have tried the Honey Pecan Chicken instead...that is definitely what I plan to order if I make it back in.) 

My entrée was served with a  biscuit on the side, and sadly, the biscuit was not as delicious as it looked.  

Honestly, I won't be driving out of my way to come back here anytime soon, but if I find myself close by at lunch time again, I will definitely stop back in to give them another try. 

On my visit, I had a nice server who didn't keep me waiting for anything... so kudos for providing good service."}
{"text":"Great place! You must try... Warm, friendly and the food was awesome!! A must do on your list.."}
{"text":"We went to Letty's for Sunday brunch. We had appetizers of Fried Green Tomatoes with Hickory smoked bacon and honey mustard drizzle and Pimento Cheese Fritters with Tomato Jam. Entree's were Fish N' Chips (no where near your average plate), Eggs Salchicha- Fried (a delectable breakfast plate), and their shrimp and grits (bacon on that one too- mmm-mmm). Dessert was Coconut Custard Pie and coffee... The only disappointment here was that we didn't have more room to put more of Letty's amazing food!!! Seriously!!! My mouth is watering again just typing this! Check out Letty's menus: http://lettysonshamrock.com/

Letty's has vegan/vegetarian items on the menus. Ingredients are only the best and the freshest with most everything being made in house from scratch. You should truly treat yourself to a LETTY'S EXPERIENCE! We will MOST CERTAINLY be FREQUENTING there again and again!!!"}
{"text":"A genuine mom & pop restaurant right out of the 1950's. No I do not mean phony posters of Elvis on the wall or poodle skirts on the waitresses. I mean honest home cooking for an honest price; for those too young to remember the 50's there were no Elvis posters or waitstaff in poodle skirts in the restaurants at that time.
The first thing that hit my eye upon entering was a genuine ugly green Hamilton Beach malted machine on the counter. Yes I did have a milk shake with my lunch - they had no malt otherwise I would have had a malted.
The pecan chicken is excellent and a turkey BLT was very good, as was the potato wedges that came with them. 
I see some folks had a bad experience with service. Either the staff has been retrained or those experiences were anomalies as we experienced friendly and very attentive service.
I recommend this place for very good food at an honest price; portions are on the large size and you may need to bring some home for the next day's meal. If you can handle it have a chocolate milk shake with lunch and bring back your youth.
One last thought. For those who do remember the 50's bring your readers as the print on the menus is not large and the lighting is a bit dim."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in the Plaza-Shamrock area. My boyfriend and I went the first weekend it opened since it's near our home. It was nice to have such friendly service and smiling faces. We tried the freshly-squeezed lemonade which is wonderful so you must try when you visit. 

The menu was nice as it had a lot of items to choose from. We had the hummachos which is a spin on the classic nachos. You must try it when you visit. It was so good we ordered another to go for later. For our entrees we had the surf n turf salad and pimiento cheeseburger. Both of  those were good. 

We will be return visitors to Letty's. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"They dont look like much from the street... But these people are great. Food, service, price and decor are all right on spot. They even have a real bar to sit at or a back porch if your feeling outdoorsy. Please check them out, the neighborhood needs more places like this and we want to see them do well. Come and enjoy it before the hipsters start flocking to it and make it intolerable."}
{"text":"My hopes were high entering the restaurant, and I was so happy that the restaurant exceeded my expectations!  The pecan chicken is to die for!  I will be coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Went by Lett'y's and it did not appear busy with at least half the tables empty, but still took almost an hour before our food came out and my wife only got a burger while I got a gravy biscuit with chicken.  I suspect a slow kitchen not the wait staff, but offering some bread while we waited (and WAITED) would have made it more tolerable than just coming by every 10 minutes saying the food will be out any minute.  We waited ~40 minutes from the time we ordered and then the food was not that good either.  I tried the rotisserie chicken salad on a previous visit that was very good , but this time the food was a big disappointment.   

We had high hopes for Letty's, but after today I do not see us going back anytime soon with rock solid restaurants in the area like Landmark & Portofino's.  

I hope Letty's will fix their issues and we will consider giving them another chance once the memory of the very bad experience today fades."}
{"text":"Great local find! Southern food with a casual but nice atmosphere! Definitely getting the southern hospitality in this joint, the employees are beyond nice!!! The pimento cheese Mac and Cheese is OUT OF THIS WORLD, seriously you MUST try it!!!"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough. Excellent food. From the honey pecan chicken to the country fried pork.. good eats"}
{"text":"The honey pecan chicken, broccoli casserole, and macaroni was awesome!  The servers were friendly and the whole menu is filled with good Southern recipes!"}
{"text":"Love Letty's! it is off the beaten path (for me), but always worth going out of the way. Food is excellent, drink is excellent, service is excellent. I have been on Friday nights, Sunday brunch, and for the periodic wine tasting events. You cannot beat Letty's wine tasting events. Good food and great wine and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast you gonna get in the Queen City.   I brought some friends from ATL here this past weekend, I had never been myself so,it was an all around treat for all first timers.  First of all, no wait for brunch on Valentine's Day Sunday?  Yes!  Got the pimento cheese balls and two orders of beignets to start.  All were perfect. My friend from ATL proclaimed he would be fine with just three more rounds of the cheese balls.  On the table there were orders of salmon cakes, fried green tomato Benedict and Eggs Salchicha.   Everyone kept \"ummmm\"'ing over each bite.  Delish.  All around.  A must try.  Take guests.  Hurry before this place has lines out the door every weekend."}
{"text":"Ecentric menu mixed with classic soul food tendencies. Great atmosphere and Letty is so friendly. Would recommend to everyone. Please go!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Letty's! Servers and bartenders are super friendly and welcoming. I love their wedge salad, chicken salad, and pimento cheese bites."}
{"text":"This place is too good. Best staff, food and drinks. Check out Letty's. 

I haven't had anything here that wasn't incredible. Letty's is a must."}
{"text":"Don't judge too quickly because you might not be impressed on first glance. The restaurant is in a very small strip plaza next to an auto shop so you could easily miss it if you're not paying attention. As we walked in we were immediately greeted and seated by none other than Letty herself who quickly informed us that not only would she be our sever but she would also be the cook! 

She's very friendly but you can also tell that she's about business! We promptly put our orders in and patiently waited for our meals which would not disappoint. Everything was delicious! Well almost everything, I personally didn't care for the Pimiento Mac & Cheese, but my other half liked them.

The Chicken Fried Chicken was excellent! The Pecan Fried Chicken was incredible! The red skin mashed potatoes are the real deal! No box potatoes here. You can really tell that the food is prepared with love and dedication. Considering that Letty was a one woman show, we have zero complaints on the food or the service. I would definitely recommend and I will certainly be back! 

Their prices are reasonable and the portions are enough! Maybe next time I'll leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"Have only been once since I got here 5 months ago, but I know I'll be back and will bring others.  Full bar, great food, nice people."}
{"text":"We decide to try Letty's for dinner tonight since it has been on our list and we enjoyed it thoroughly!  We were concerned after reading other reviews, but we experienced great food and great service.

We started with fried green tomatoes and the pimento cheese fritters.  The fritters were unreal, very tasty and crisp.  I am not one for fried cheese, but this is my exception.  The tomatoes were much the same and were cooked perfectly- it unnerves me when fried green tomatoes are cooked into a mushy mess.

For entrees I had the pork chops and my better half enjoyed the shrimp fra Davila.  I noticed fried okra on the menu and ordered it as well (I had to check it out if they really do southern comfort food!).  

The shrimp dish arrived on a lovely bed of al dente pasta with a nice light sauce with good spiciness.  Most importantly, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and not reduced to rubber.  The chops were also not overlooked (which is a huge issue with me) and had the most lovely glaze.  The fried okra was flavorful and crunchy.  Presentation was great as indicated in posted pics.  

I have to say that our dinner was great and visiting with Letty herself was an added bonus.  Check it out and decide for yourself!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's like being in your neighbors home. I love Letty - she always table touches and remembers each guest. I really love an owner who cares. And that"}
{"text":"The reviews on Yelp are really good so we finally decided to check it out. The atmosphere first of all was very welcoming & warm!  You would never know it just from viewing from the outside ~ Nice & clean!! The service was amazing, very nice and friendly staff they made you feel very comfortable. The owner came out to ask how was the food and so did the manager several times. 

Okay, so let's talk about the food!!! It was awesome!! We ordered an appetizer \"roasted red peeper hummus\" it came with olives & banana peepers and fresh pita bread! It was huge and delicious!! 

Our entrees Fish & Chips, Pasta with Chicken were amazing; we couldn't eat it all. The portions are great for the prices; and the prices are very reasonable! There is a full bar, and the wine list isn't bad either! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"You absolutely will be delighted with the food at Letty's!  I honestly could go every weekend for brunch (and often do)  Staff is attentive and the food is always delish.   Don't pass this one by!"}
{"text":"I know, I know.  Why did it take me so long to visit Letty's? Well, I'm glad I did. Yes, you have to find Letty's because it's not on most peoples \"rabbit track.\" But, it's certainly an easy trip from the Plaza Midwood and Elizabeth neighborhoods. It is definitely worth seeking this restaurant out.The environment is comfortable with a bar atmosphere on one side and a bit more formal dining room on the other. Original paintings cover the walls which adds a lot of interest to the space. I enjoyed chatting with Jason the bartender and other folks at the bar while I had a glass of wine. I ordered salmon with the macaroni and cheese and fried okra. Everything was prepared well and tasted very good. 
I recommend a trip to the Charlotte Museum of History - a mile and a half up Shamrock - then lunch at Letty's. That would be a great Charlotte day.
Letty is a veteran of Hotel Charlotte - this is her own venture and you can tell a pro is at the helm. 
Put Letty's on your list."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little restaurant. The food is excellent and Letty is charming. This is my second time and the food and service is great. If you're in town on business or for fun, Uber or Lyft over, you won't be disappointed and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"My dinner group met here. We had called earlier in the day for a reservation so they knew we were coming and said they were \"happy to have us\" which was encouraging.

I arrived early and sat at the bar and met Letty herself. It looked like there were 3 people working out front and only one real server. The other person appeared to be only a hostess but was helping out where she could.

The place was busy and Letty informed us that it was busier than normal because they had an unannounced group show up. We were also informed that their food order comes the next day so they were running out of a lot of things. It was nice to know that before ordering.

Things got a little odd after that. Usually drink orders are taken before the meal ordering but here it was done at the same time and drinks took 45 minutes to arrive after we were initially seated.  

For a meal, I ordered the Country Fried chicken and side salad. When my meal arrived I received fries instead of a side salad but I was too involved in conversation at the table to realize what was missing until halfway into my meal. The chicken was delicious and very tender. It was fried boneless chicken breast so it was almost healthy.  The sausage gravy on top was fantastic and I just wanted to smother everything with it including the fries. Unfortunately, I devoured it too quickly to do so.

Other people at the table had fish and chips, the honey pecan chicken, pimento cheese burger, garden burger and a few other items. The chicken is what seemed to stand out here.

For dessert, I ordered the berry crisp which was had good flavors that married well together.

I understand they were busy and seems a bit short handed and understand these things happen.  The good thing is that Letty herself was always pleasant and gracious for our business. I'd really like to return here and see if we can catch them on a normal night."}
{"text":"We went to Lettys Sunday at 10:40 for the first time.  We were pleased that we were able to be seated right away.  The man who sat us warned us that they had just sat a group of large tables and if we would order quickly,  we could beat their order.  We ordered immediately- I always get steaks and eggs- it was the first thing listed and my wife ordered the sampler. 

Clealry our order went in AFTER the big tables.  We sat for an hour- for breakfast.

My wife and I both worked as wait staff- and we were more disappointed in the lack of service and acknowledgement by their staff.  Our waitress looked frustrated but was clearly avoiding our table- it seemed the rest of the staff appeared to be doing the same.

So the food came 62 minutes later.  It was good.  The steak was small (see photo) and uninspired but the food was hot and we were hungry.

With a 20% tip (not gonna punish a waitress for a bad kicthen and management) we paid $40 to wait an hour for breakfast.

We wont be back.

oh yeah Monarch \"fancy\" Ketchup too"}
{"text":"I went here after I had seen their menu on another website.  

The staff were all very friendly and warm.

The Honey Pecan Chicken was good, home-cooking!  I would definitely get it again.
I got the rice instead of the potatoes and it was good.  The broccoli casserole though... uh - not really any broccoli in it and the casserole part was just mush.  I didn't enjoy that.  They have home-made desserts (Coconut Custard!!!!) which I'll have to try in the future.

I saw they have a Saturday and a Sunday brunch, so I'll try to make it in for that one weekend!

They have a nice, small bar.  No taps, but a decent selection of bottled beer.  No TV other than a small one on the bar.

They are in the process of making it their own place so the decor will be updated as they can.  For now, it's got possibilities.  They do have free wi-fi (enjoy).

I will definitely check it out again and try some different things."}
{"text":"Consistently good good and outstanding service.  Love the ribs, the appetizers (try the Hummachos) and the steaks.  Letty always stops by to visit.  Great neighborhood restaurant and bar."}
{"text":"The service was lacking; we were seated immediately but waited a while for anyone to address our drink and food order, waited again for a long time for the check when we were finished.  The smothered chicken and grits was delicious but my wife's Mediterranean salad was overpriced and flavorless (sub-par black olives and the salad dressing was not a good compliment to the ingredients).  I'd like to go back and try some other menu items and observe possible service improvements on a different day of the week.  Would not recommend going for their salads, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch based off some Yelp reviews I read. My fellow Yelpers did not disappoint. The place is a mom and pop type. I had the veggie wrap and sweet potato fries. Both of which were delicious. The service was fast which was perfect because I was there for my lunch break. I plan on coming back and trying some other menu items! Service was great!"}
{"text":"I was pretty sad to see Foskoskie's close, but glad something new took it's place. At first glance, not much changed - they still have the awesome oak bar when you first walk in, and rightfully so. The bar is a historic piece of the building, when Pike's Soda Shop (yes, that one) was in this location and still connected to Pike's Pharmacy (yes, there is a relation). The honey pecan chicken from the Foskoskie's menu is still there, and still amazing.

I'm enjoying the sorta-southern, sorta-creole combo going on. They do the genres justice with good food that's not overly complicated. To quote the owner, \"We know we're not a fancy date night place. We're a neighborhood restaurant where you can bring your girl for a burger and a beer and just unwind.\"  The owner, by the way, is incredibly friendly and will remember you when you come back. I love it when the staff makes you feel like a friend visiting.

The special of the day is usually a great choice, and the \"neat loaf\" (vegetarian meat loaf) is pretty dang good, too. As others have said, they price half-size portions on the menu to keep things in check. Other restaurants - take the hint.

It's good food, relaxed atmosphere, and the prices are right. We've made Letty's our weeknight out, call up some friends to grab a bite at the last minute place. Every neighborhood needs their \"down the street\" place and I'm glad this is mine!"}
{"text":"Used to be Foskoskies. Wish it still was. Menu only half changed, but wasn't quite as good. It's a cozy spot, that I wish I enjoyed more. The service was extremely poor and awkward, which is why we won't return.

We came in at an early afternoon time...after lunch, before dinner. The owners were sitting at the bar doing some paperwork and did not greet us. The bartender came out from the back to greet and seat us while the owners never looked up. I find that to be tasteless, considering patronage should be their main priority. 

After being seated, we were asked our drink orders. We were not given menus. Our drinks came before our menus came. We actually had to ask for them. The server, who was also the bartender...and after we ordered also found he was the cook at the time was a bit overbearing. He told my teenage daughter repeatedly how beautiful she was and that made me almost uncomfortable enough to leave. He literally stood at our table for 5 minutes or so at a time...even while we ate. 

The food wasn't bad at all, but took more than 20 minutes to be prepared. We would give this place another try based on the food...but the service was inadequate."}
{"text":"I'll start this review the same way I always start...five stars is nearly impossible to achieve (with me). To Letty's credit, there was not one thing they could have done better during my visit. No wait (11:30am on a Sunday), great/kind wait staff, great sweet tea and great food. Now, let's get to the review...

I try to check-out local spots when traveling. Yelp makes that easier. I wanted something close to the university and open on Sunday at 11am. Letty's was!

I ordered the honey pecan fried chicken, after narrowing it down to this and one other option on the menu. (I don't even remember what that other dish was, but it had shrimp and a Creole sauce). The server recommended the honey pecan fried chicken, so who am I to argue?

The dish cane with two sides. I opted for the rice pilaf and fried potato wedges. The rice was...well, rice. If its not bad, its what you expect, right? The potato wedges were good. I guess ive had bad wedges, but these were not. Did I mention they were fried? I barely ate the sided, though. Instead, I spent my hunger on the two boneless fried chicken masterpieces covered in honey and pecans. I don't even like honey and pecans, but I devoured it all! If/when back in Charlotte, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Looooove Letty's! The Neatloaf is on POINT! Its moist, and flavorful (not a dry, bread crumby mess like other places), and I appreciate that it comes in half orders. 

The mashed taters are creamy and made to perfection ~ homemade and comforting...makes your insides smile :-).

And The pimento fritters with relish are DIVINE! They are little, golden, crunchy, pim cheese filled, deep fried balls of goodness with a relish thats tangy and sweet and perfectly off-sets the flavors."}
{"text":"Two words: THE PIE

Seriously, why did it take me so long to go to Letty's?  I've been hearing about it for months now every since moving to this end of town and I'm kicking myself for not going sooner.

The price is right and the food is amazing.  To top it all off, the atmosphere is fun, very clean and the staff were all very friendly.  My drink never went below half full and the food came out fast.

I had the honey pecan chicken which is seriously some of the best chicken I've had in Charlotte.  The broccoli casserole was amazing too.  Everything tasted fresh and homemade.

My neighbor kept telling me to order pie first to make sure I had room to eat it.  I thought he was just being funny, until I had a bite.  OMG hands down the best pie I've ever had (I got the coconut custard).  I was told every dessert is made by Letty herself and from scratch.  

We went for lunch and the food was so good we debated going  back for dinner!  I think we found our new local favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a friend today.  Charming place with a retro feel.  Our server was warm and friendly.  He brought our drinks immediately and was so patient when my friend took a long time deciding what she wanted to eat.
The menu features a vegetarian chef salad.  Thank you!  It often seems that when I order a meat free chef salad, it is little more than greens and a few veggies.  This salad was filled with plenty of vegetables and Pepper-Jack cheese.  I requested blue cheese dressing, which was served on the side.  My friend got this burger that had an egg and bacon on it.  She especially enjoyed her side order of fries.
The name \"Letty's\" suits the atmosphere of this place, and there is a real Letty who owns it!  I look forward to coming back here."}
{"text":"My dinner group decided to go old school and pick a side of town that we don't often go to.  I myself had never been to Letty's, but after reading the menu, I was looking forward to checking it out and enjoying some good old cooking.

After almost getting lost, I came upon the Letty's sign and was thrilled. The restaurant is definitely off the beaten path.  Once inside I noticed the restaurant is divided, one side with a bar and a few small tables and the other specifically for the dining area.  The restaurant was packed, but luckily we had a reservation.  Letty herself came to our table and walked us through the menu, highlighting the specials, what they were out of for the night and definitely focused some time on the wine list, as they offer some that cannot be found in the state at this time.

After Letty left, service became a little shady.  We arrived at 7:00 and by 7:45 we had yet to receive our drinks.  After asking for some bread, being that butter was on the table and you're typically brought bread when there is butter, our waiter brought me, and only me, a biscuit.  Really? And, the worst past was it was definitely out of the microwave because it was hard a brick on the bottom but soft of the top. I attempted to eat it, but it tasted horrible.

We had a group of ten so our party had a variety of dinner options, including the Pecan Chicken, Smothered Fried Chicken, Fish & Chips, Burgers and a few others.  Everyone who had the chicken loved it!  I ordered the Fish and Chips and absolutely loved the chips. The fish was okay, a little small and the batter was a little mushy.  Overall it was good, but I have definitely had better Fish & Chips. I did taste some of the Pimento Cheese burger and I should have gone with that, so delish!  Several of us also enjoyed desserts, which we all good.

Although service was definitely not on point, the food was good, and perfectly priced for what you get, and I love the fact this is a locally owned restaurant with the owner involved in things as much as she was."}
{"text":"It just doesn't get any better than Letty's. The service is southern hospitality come to life - friendly, genuine, charming. I order something different upon every visit and never once have I been disappointed - the steak and eggs is especially great though! Veggie options, a nice beer and wine list, good music, nice patio. A majorly underrated Charlotte gem."}
{"text":"I really do not want to give an average 3-star for this place because I want this place to be great. I applaud the owner for believing in the forgotten East Charlotte and decided to continue what Foskoskies started. Yes, this is the same spot as the former Foskoskie. 

The decor stayed virtually the same. It's a small intimate spot, very warm and down-home feel. The space can get a little loud because concrete walls just don't do well with sound. The entrance is my least favorite area, because you literally walk into the edge of the bar. There's no space to stand to wait without being in the way. Speaking of the bar, while the main dining room is dimly lit, the bar is quite bright in comparison (which is odd... normally it's the other way around).  

I took mom to here for brunch on Sunday (it's only open for brunch on Sundays FYI). I expected it to be busy. What I do not understand is, they should expect it to be busy too, and somehow everyone looked overwhelmed. It took awhile for us to be even RECOGNIZED at the door, let alone seated. I didn't mind the wait, but a \"hey ladies, I'll get you seated as soon as possible\" would be nice.

Once seated, I was dragging the possibility of not getting any service. After all, I have a feeling there's not an organized waiter sections here. So I literally went \"old school.\" See, growing up in Hong Kong, most restaurants didn't have sections, people just grabbed the nearest waiter walking by. In this case, I established strong eye contact, and got myself a waitress.

Our waitress doesn't normally work there, but she was nice. In fact everyone was nice, it's just disorganized and chaotic. The menu looked good. The price looked even better. My chicken & grits with sasuage gravy and biscuit was $9. Mom had Country Fried Pork Chop with Eggs for $8.50. I also had a cup of the lentil soup for $3. Our order took awhile to arrive unsurprisingly. I asked them for some biscuits to keep us from starving, and their biscuits and scones were delightful!

My order came out a little disappointing. It was literally chicken fingers on top of grits. I had to ask for the missing gravy and biscuit. Mom's order came out looking great. The pork chop was tiny (and a little dry/tough), but honestly that's probably what a normal portion should look like. It also came with a little fruits and roasted potatoes which were yummy. Lentil soup was very thick, it was more like lentil stew. I didn't taste much of the curry, but it did its job as being filling.

So yes, while the visit was not at all the most positive, and the food was not perfectly done, somehow I find this place still a charming spot. I hope the service improves, and I will definitely support my neighborhood MOST affordable brunch spot!"}
{"text":"First off don't let its appearance keep you away! There aren't many of these kind of place left in Charlotte especially in this area of town these days. It is good simple food at reasonable prices which you don't see much anymore. The pecan fried chicken is their signature dish and it seems like you can't go wrong with it. The vegetarian meatloaf is probably the best I have ever had. And make sure to save room for one of their always changing desserts! I wasn't a big fan of the summer corn (a little to \"relishy\" for me) salad but the broccoli casserole and the pimento Mac and cheese were great."}
{"text":"When we first bought our new house in Shannon Park late last summer, the first thing we had to figure out was our neighborhood dinner options.  Just down the street we have solid old Lang Van, but one cannot survive on garlic tofu alone.  Plaza-Midwood is just a stone's throw away, but always seems so crowded and chock full of douchebags. (I am getting old.)  Then we remembered Foskoskies!  Man, how we wanted to love Foskoskies.  The menu was quaint, and the patio was a secret garden, and it was right around the corner next to our small, local pharmacy!  ...And the service was spotty, and the food was inconsistent, and then they lost their alcohol license.  When the doors closed, it was almost a relief to not have to try so hard to like the place anymore.  Then came Letty's.  In the handful of times we've been by for a weeknight dinner, the food has been simple, honest, and good, the portions large, the service excellent, and the atmosphere very, very welcoming.  The owner is attentive, engaged, and entertaining.  Our server remembered our drink order after the first visit.  It's not gourmet, hip, or trendy, but Letty's is shaping up to be everything Foskoskies wasn't for us:  a friendly neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"I will say this is a cool little hot spot! It used to be piles soda shop. Now it's the wonderful Lettys. And what a neat place with a bar that serves beer and wine, the menus is decently priced. It has a very quant intimate setting for one or two (great for a date!) or tables for families. The intimate lighting adds to the feel of comfort. Not to mention once you open the door the smell of the food is incredible. You become immediately overwhelmed with \"what in the world are they cooking in that awesome kitchen? There are specials every day which include various items such as fish or chicken. I had the comfort food of chicken fried chicken with amazing gravy. Along side was mash potatoes and penne pasta topped with a white Alfredo sauce and freaking bacon!!!! Yes bacon. I will def be back here to try the special of the day and more menu item."}
{"text":"Hands down the best country fried chicken in town. You can always count on original and delicious specials all for an affordable price. 
Highly recommend you stop in for lunch or dinner. 

Also wonderful quite spot for Date Night!"}
{"text":"Best meal my wife and I have eaten in Charlotte. 
The Honey Pecan Chicken, the Broccoli casserole and the Mac N Cheese is awesome. 
It's great place, nice atmosphere and very pleasant service. 
I wish we had one of these in Texas."}
{"text":"As many reviewers have said, we've driven past Letty's a number of times before we actually stopped in.  Now, I'm kicking myself for living in Charlotte for three years and not been to Letty's until recently.  We enjoyed ourselves so much that we came back for brunch the next day. 

A big component of how much we enjoyed Letty's is the staff. Our waitress, Verna, was very entertaining and welcoming. She gave us some recommendations and some story time as well! When we told her it was our first visit, she insisted that the proprietor, Letty herself, come to meet us.  

Letty was just about as friendly as they come - she wanted to know all about us and was happy to tell us about the place and even some local history. She also gave us a hard time for not considering dessert....so we ended up with coconut pie, which was fantastic. 

We've been back a few times since. The honey pecan chicken is up there with some of the best fried chicken I've had. 

Check it out!"}
