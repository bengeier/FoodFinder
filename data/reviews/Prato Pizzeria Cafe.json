{"text":"decisons decisions

u can't imagine how many times people ask me \"what is the best pizza in Mtl\"

they are so many different types of dough, methods of cooking, then the place itself, the diversity of pizzas, etc  

then there's Prato, i will NOT say it's the best pizza in Mtl, but for the price it's sure damn close!! (for higher end pizza go to Bottega or Vinizza, i did not try Magpie yet...)

very family atmosphere, no fancy/pancy, just good ol' brick oven pizza with some eclectic choices! i love their white bacon and onions pizza

i go there with the family and just have a good time

{"text":"Extremely decent Italian comfort food. Margherita pizza is delicious, crusts are always super-thin. Added bonus tonight of Italian pop club remixes (no sarcasm - nostalgia!). As mentioned by others, don't come here looking for an extensive wine list, but hey I don't need anything fancy with my pizza."}
{"text":"Good wood fire pizza, irregular shape, artisanal, just lacking some taste and texture in the dough but overall good"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza in an area that's lacking.  I was a bit nervous going for pizza on St. Laurent, but this place did it right.  Nice, crispy, slightly charred crust with good toppings.  I had the neapolitana, which had sundried black olives, giant capers, anchovies and mozzarella.  Very nice.  Also, not too loud -- good for conversation.

Docked it two stars. One because it's a bit overpriced, and the other because they lost/forgot our reservation.  We were still seated right away -- at 8 on a saturday, though.  Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"I think in a search for good pizza in this city, an wood oven is a definite plus.  I liked the pizza here -- it isn't for people who love a thick crust or lots and lots of cheese, instead, it relies more on quality of a few ingredients, something I really like.  The tiramisu was great, and the service was friendly.  I would definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"the thin crust pizza (I prefer margherita) is really good.

The prices are very high drink selection isn't great, so minus a star.

Service is variable, you pretty much have to raise your hand/ask for things. Staff isn't very observant or attentive - have been several times. So minus one star. 

But the flavour and texture of the plain is great."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious - thin, crisp crust, light and flavourful toppings! You can literally eat an entire pan and not feel bloated or overly full. 

The décor is unpretentious and homey Italian - 1L house wine (not bad at all for the price) is served in a ceramic jar and pizza is served directly in the pan it was cooked in. 

Service is equally as delicious and unpretentious. The staff was pleasant and knowledgeable and created a  really nice rapport with us. 

As close to an authentic Italian pizza as you can get in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Pizza was OK not worth 25$ nor did I get the WoW factor, comments from the waiter pissed me off and service was mediocre I felt like it bother him waiting on us."}
{"text":"Stopped over here as walked past from the famous smoked meats place just up the road. The pizza tastes wonderful - thin crisp base and fresh tasty toppings. The stone baked oven adds to the flavour as well and we were pleasantly surprised. Accepts credit cards a plus for us foreigners as well. Quite a nice little place - you can sit by the window to view the passers by on the street or opt for the inside with posters of films on the walls."}
{"text":"Great Italian food, pizza is a wood fired oven and amazing pizza dough.  

And dont forget the canoli!"}
{"text":"This as got to be the most authentic Neapolitan style pizza this side of the Atlantic.

Italian cooking is all about the freshest and best ingredients and there's no shortness of it here.

 The crust is thin; crispy with just the right amount of chew. There's plenty of different pizzas available or you can create your own masterpiece.

There are salads, a special pasta of the day and few other items on the menu to choose from but to be honest, they pale in comparison to the pizzas. So just go there and have a pizza and nothing else!

The only reason I didn't give Prato a 5 star is because of its prices. 4 pizzas, a salad and soup special, 3 Brios and a beer set me back $150! For an Italian, that's on the verge of blasphemy when I know what it truly costs to actually make a pizza.

Nevertheless, it's still my favourite pizza in Montreal. So I'm willing to pay the price for it."}
{"text":"One of the best things about this place is that unlike that famous place in Little Italy, you don't have to wait in line outside to get great pizza. The pizza is ultra thin, the crust is perfectly crispy, the toppings taste like they were just picked from the garden, and the pizza comes to you within minutes from ordering it. What more could you ask for?

The service is good, prices are reasonable and the pizza is fantastic. I've had the margherita and vegi pizzas but the others all looked great. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some friends. We had 6 people and the waitress was very accommodating.

Very, very tasty pizza. I had the Montreal, which was their pepperoni, mushroom, and pepper pizza. Not sure why it's called that, but it was awesome. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"Nothing says Montreal like Montreal brick-oven cooked pizzas, right?

Okay, well maybe not, but this place was still great!

It was a complete fluke...some may venture so far as to call it fate...we walked in here off the street, looking for some dinner and decided to give it a go. Perhaps it was angels??

We ordered two pizzas and split them. One pizza = a good size meal for a person, so we were stuffed and happy at the end.

Service was good and pizzas came out fast and fresh from the oven. Nice, crispy crusts and gooey centres. Yummy!

The waiter accidentally dropped a fork on me when he was taking away our plates and apologized profusely. No biggie....particularly because he was so apologetic. (Let's face it, if someone makes a small mistake, but acts like \"it ain't no thang\" we get a little turned off). 

Problems: Well, it's a bit pricey and the tables were set really closely together. It did feel like we were eating dinner with some strangers a bit. But neither of those things would dissuade me from going back here in the future. Bellissimo....as they say in Montreal."}
{"text":"I had a really strange experience when I went to this restaurant. I'll start off by saying that the pizza was very good. I won't complain about the food, or the service, or the decor. 

I had the horrible luck of going on recycling night and sitting at the window. surrounding restaurants and businesses put out many large bags of recycling in front of Prato. I couldn't help but watch 3 people scavenge through bags for an hour. It was ridiculously mesmerizing and it totally ruined my night. 

If you go, don't sit by the window."}
{"text":"Pizzeria,pas cafe. J'y vais depuis des années,toujours a midi.un italien pas compliqué sur la main.decor et carte de vins simples.les pates et les pizzas sont toujours impeccables et la vue sur la foule qui monte/descend la st-laurent a son interet. Le garçon,toujours le même est de bonne humeur et de bon conseil. Prix corrects.pour les touristes:porte voisine de Schwartz."}
{"text":"Schwartz's was too busy, so I decided to try some pizza I'd heard about in Montreal. Stumbled upon this place so I decided to try it out. 
Friendly staff, and great food. Not too oily at all, and the dough was just right. You can tell the ingredients were good quality, and the prices were reasonable. 
I recommend if you're out on a date, or with some friends!"}
{"text":"C'est officiel! Je tends mon chapeau à Prato pour la meilleure pizza napoletana à Montréal! La sauce, si bien balancée et parfaitement épicée, elle crée la base parfaite pour toutes les variétés de pizza sur le menu! Et la pâte? Mince, tirée à la main, à la fois bien rôtie, mais encore un peu moelleuse. Mmmm. Dans mon cas, j'ai partagé deux sortes différentes, la margherita et la campagna (fromage de chèvre, champignons, artichauts, basilic). Toutes deux étaient juste débiles. La margherita ou la pomodoro, à mon avis, sont les deux pizza qui permettent de déterminer l'authenticité de ce type de resto. Et me voilà épatée. Ça me rappel Napoli. 

Les prix au menu, ainsi que ceux des vins, sont bien abordable pour la grosseur des assiettes et la qualité des plats. Franchement, je viens de trouver mon nouveau spot à pizza et, contre toute attente, elle ne se trouve pas dans la Petite-Italie!"}
{"text":"Wow, not only did we have fantastic pizza, and service, the pizza prices, I found were super reasonable! Prior to coming, I was told for years now that this is the only pizza place in Montreal that did pizza just like Naples. Now I've never been to Naples yet, but I can tell you it was indeed very good pizza, (I really enjoyed the pizza sauce) and I usually go with a Margherita pizza because I usually find that if a place can make a simple dish amazing then it's gotta be great. Coming with friends however also allowed me to try other variants.

We had a really large group with us and they managed to get our food out efficiently and we also sat very comfortably. I definitely recommend giving this place a try, I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant on St Laurent, the name says it all, the specialty  here is pjzza,  and the pizza is good. Prices are reasonable they vary from 12 to 18$ and you have a good selection of white and tomato pizzas. At the far end of the restaurant you can see the chef and the pizza being  prepared and cooked. They also offer a variety of salads. I tried the pizza marinara, i really enjoyed it the crust was thin and cooked to perfection. In the mood for pizza,  try Prato!"}
{"text":"Je cherchais une bonne pizzeria est le prato avait retenu mon attention avec de bonnes critiques. Je n'ai pas été déçu de la pizza que j'avais prise. 
Il s'agit de la \"Di Fausto\" avec chèvre, fiordi latte mozzarella, parmesan, prosciutto et basilic frais. La pâte est bonne et les ingrédients sont frais et de qualité. Il n'y a rien à dire au niveau de cette cuisine.

Le service était rapide car le restaurant assez vide (lundi ou mardi soir) et le serveur assez réactif.

J'ai trouvé cependant les prix un peu cher pour une pizza (17/18$ sans taxe) mais la qualité est au rdv. Il faut juste le savoir avant d'y aller.

Je recommande si un jour vous avez une envie de pizza comme j'ai pu l'avoir. Je voudrais bien mettre 3.5 mais pas possible :( Je modifierais peut être ma note à la prochaine visite !"}
{"text":"What a quaint little place to dine in. I ordered the lasagna Bolognese which comes with either a soup or salad and OH. MY. GOD. Generous piece, it was so succulent, perfectly balanced with the sauce. JUST DELICIOUS! I cannot say enough good things about this dish. I wish I had another piece. Was so worth the wait, I will order an entire tray of it next time just for myself!!!"}
{"text":"Sur la base des bonnes notes données dans Yelp, nous sommes allés déjeuner dans cette pizzeria.
C'était là notre première expérience de Pizzeria à Montreal (et au Canada) en fait.
La première surprise était l'attitude du serveur (un chauve barbu) : pas aimable du tout, pendant un temps, on s'est même crus dans une pizzeria à Paris. C'est particulièrement choquant à Montréal où les gens sont pourtant si sympathiques et si accueillants.
Ensuite, on souhaite commander une bière pression, mais il nous explique (du genre on le gonfle à lui demander de la bière) qu'il n'a rien de ce qui est écrit sur la carte et si on veut de la bière, ce sera de la Stella en bouteille ... Soit ... On va prendre ça ...
Ensuite, en regardant la carte, on constate qu'aucune pizza ne contient de jambon. Il faut le prendre en supplément et pour $2.5, vous aurez 3 tranches minuscules de jambon .. ce qui nous surprend par rapport à nos habitudes françaises ou le jambon, s'il n'est pas forcément en plus grande quantité, est généralement inclu dans le prix de base.
Ensuite, ce cher serveur nous amène nos Pizza, sans même nous annoncer ce qui était quoi, en nous demandant à nous de prendre celle qu'on avait commandé ...
Ça avait donc très mal commencé. Heureusement, la pizza était très bonne : pâte gouteuse et cuite juste comme il faut, ingrédients savoureux et de qualité.
Au final, on s'en tire pour $70 pour deux Pizza et deux bière (pourboire inclu, mais je n'aurait pas dû : le serveur n'a même pas répondu à notre \"merci, au revoir\".
En résumé : superbes pizza, une addition un peu élevée à mon goût mais par contre un serveur antipathique et désagréable qui fait perdre 2 étoiles à notre note."}
{"text":"A little spot on St-Laurent, if you are in the mood for a little bit of Roma, you have come to the right place. Pizza crust so thin, baked in a coal burning brick oven. The toppings for what ever your pleasure."}
{"text":"It's really not my style to give bad reviews but this place was really disappointing. 

We were in the mood for a great Pizza experience but this wasn't it. 

A friend and I ordered the exact same item but received two different Pizzas. And the waitress couldn't explain it and never offered to make it right. Just asked me if I would still eat it. \"Yeah, I guess, since I don't feel like waiting another 30 minutes for my Pizza\"

I can get over slow service when it's really busy but not when we are the only two customers there. (And the fact that we were alone should've been a huge red flag)

To sum it all up. The Pizza was a mediocre 4/10. The Service a 3/10. 

I'll be trying another Pizza place next time."}
{"text":"Really delicious pizza - you can tell that they put care into the ingredients they use which is great. The sauce is really fantastic and they have great options on the menu. 

We enjoyed the atmosphere - it was a relaxed restaurant and we sat for a while after the meal just chatting. We weren't rushed out which was appreciated although we did have to get their attention for water refills it was a god service. 

Their prices are a little on the higher range for what you get in the end - maybe because of their location but it did feel worth it. 

End the meal with a cappuccino definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Nous avons découvert ce restaurant sur la rue St Laurent par hasard il y a plusieurs années. J'ai tellement adoré leur lasagne végétarienne eux qui semblent spécialisés dans la pizza cuite au four à bois. La sauce était excquise, bien assaisonnée et la portion de lasagne généreuse. Je recommande fortement ce restaurant, la décoration y est modeste, mais le service aimable. Je suis toujours triste lorsque je passe devant et que je le vois si peu remplie. La nourriture en vaut vraiment le détour!!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch with a friend at 240 and we were served fantastic magheritas FAST.

It's thin crust crispy crust

The ingredients were simple but you can taste the quality.

We will be back again"}
{"text":"The pizza is decent. Their sauce and bread are very good. Everything else was just ok. Including the service. I will give it another try only if I'm in the area and feel like pizza."}
{"text":"Thin crust which I prefer, but it was very soggy from the sauce and the whole pizza overall was lacking flavor. The prices were also a bit much for the amount served. I got the margherita pizza. 

The ambiance is nice though! I also thought it was unique how they platter it on a cookie sheet!"}
