{"text":"What a disappointment!  Went there for Valentine's Day after someone recommended it as one of her favorite restaurants.  I checked Yelp first saw the mixed reviews, but gave them the benefit of the doubt when I learned Cartrights former chef was now at Heavens Kaffee.  We had reservations and were promptly seated.  The waitress was friendly.  That's about it for all I have good to say.

We waited for about 20 minutes for our food to arrive after placing our order.  They did not bring bread or salads while we waited.  Atmosphere was marginally ok.  White tablecloths and candles could have been cozy and romantic but the bright overhead lights and soft drinks served in cans spoiled the mood.  The food was bland and the presentation was like something you would get in a bad diner.  I had the pork schnitzel.  It was a beige blob of meat and gravy on top of mashed potatoes with red cabbage on the side.  It was bland.  I had to add salt which I rarely do just to give it some flavor.  My friend had the cuban pulled pork sandwich after the waitress said it was one of her favorite items on the menu.  It was mostly bread with hardly any pulled pork in it, and very bland tasting.  He hated it.  He described it as one of the worst meals he had had in recent memory.  There are lots of good restaurants in Cave Creek.  This is not one of them"}
{"text":"This is a new place and is getting better every day.  I have been there twice and the first time, all of the guests at the bar were raving about the hamburger.  It is ground fresh daily and looked amazing.  The second time I was there I had the rouladen.  It was almost like my mother used to make (she is German) but they changed the gravy a bit and it added a tasty twist to one of my favorite dishes!  In addition, the owner, Stefan, bought out a new app for me to try.....Frikadellen....it was delicious!
Lastly, the staff was great and friendly.  Cienna already knows what I drink and I was treated as a regular on only my second visit.  Next on my list to try...Jager Schnitzel.
I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place from a friend who stopped in for lunch recently, so after a hike in Cave Creek, my roommate and I were starving and noticed the 25% off first order offer for checking in on yelp and decided to give it a try. Since I had been there before when it was another restaurant, the first thing I noticed was the new decor which is welcoming, comfortable and casual classy. We sat at the bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender. The menu was very interesting. We ordered 4 items to share. The Greek Salad, Gyro Platter, Brat Sliders and Kraut Cakes. Everything was delicious and service was great. I highly recommend the grapefruit infused beer! After lunch the owner came out to say hello and ask how our experience was. He was very pleasant and I wish him luck with his place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service is friendly but slow. Understaffed...food was okay but pretty bland. Cheesecake was awful. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I was excited that this place opened, since there's a myriad of Mexican and BBQ places in Cave Creek but nothing with Greek food. I ordered a gyro--not the platter, mind you, but the sandwich. It came with thin fries which were very good. The gyro was pretty good too.  However, I can't see paying $13.00 for this (I've tried every gyro place in the Phoenix area too). If they don't lower their prices, they will go out of business.
On a side note, the decor inside is very nice, but the signage and building need improvement.  The sign is so hard to read, it was difficult to see that it was a restaurant."}
{"text":"It was so-so. Pros - pork schnitzel was very good, decor was charming. Cons - they forgot our appetizer, the potatoes were bland and they left us stranded waiting for the check for 15 mins (they did comp us dessert for forgetting our app). Was not that impressed."}
{"text":"I had to yelp this place before trying it. From the sign and exterior, I guessed it was a biker bar or something. Don't let the ugly exterior (it's not really their fault, there isn't much you can do with it) turn you off. The interior is MUCH better than the outside. 

The food was good! I had the Italian sandwich, hubby had the cuban sandwich, and kiddo had a burger. The fries are a little weird...itty, bitty, shoe string. Leaves you confused as to how to eat them, hands or fork? Tiramisu was really good. I'd like to think that I'll branch out and try something else next time. But, I'll probably order the same thing. Yum!"}
{"text":"WOW! This place used to be a mexican restaurant that was a total dump. Now, its upscale by comparison. 
The local's complaining should think back to what used to be there. It's very refreshing to see this place rise up from the ashes of the old.

The food was good and the service was attentive.

The prices are in line with the area, so if your looking for cheap, keep looking or maybe take advantage of the yelp deal.

I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"Don't let the window paint or a hop, skip ans jump drive to Cave Creek scare you off. This isn't a fly by night place. The white table linens inside set the stage for a elegant, memorable meal.  And let me just tell you, don't leave the building without trying the brat sliders! The wine list is supple. The staff is friendly. Humble, cozy place. The band on a Saturday night, a nice touch. A little loud, but made for something different.  And the menu was different. A little bit of Italian, Greek and German. I wanted for more options but apparently an expanded menu is in the works. And we cannot breakfast Wow! Still, the Cuban sandwich and just my size skinny fries were off the chart! Overall, a surprisingly good, worldly, experience. We are eager to go back and bring friends."}
