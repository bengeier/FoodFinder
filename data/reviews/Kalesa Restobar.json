{"text":"They're a fairly new restaurant. Each time I come back the service is faster and the food is tastier! The palabok and turon with ube ice cream are my faves!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend eating at this Filipino restaurant. We ordered Sinigang na baboy and it tasted bland & not even sour which it is supposed to be. Shanghai was homemade, burnt and has no taste, we did not even like not a single food that we ordered. We left the table with our food 70% untouched. Very terrible! Don't waste your time and money!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to dine at the most authentic Filipino restaurant in the city, you've found the right place. I've given Kalesa a 5 star review; not only was the food spectacular, the insides of the restaurant was beautiful.   A 'kalesa' is known as a horse drawn calash used in the Philippines, one of the modes of transportation in the 18th century. And I have to say, the inner aesthetic perfectly matches it's name. Decorated with wheels and vintage portraits of these vehicles. Even the washrooms themselves fitted the decor.   We'd ordered two servings of their famous BBQ, a bowl of Bulalo and of course some rice to go with it. All dishes well worth their pricing.   Each BBQ dish came with two skewers plated atop some banana leaves on a dish. It also came with a side of achara and I think some vinegar as well. Unfortunately did not get to try the sauce on the side, frankly because there was no need for it. The dish shone on its own.  The Bulalo came in an extremely generous serving, enough for a 4 people I would think. And even came with a side of Patis ( fish sauce) to go with it. No complaints about this dish, it was amazing.   We also ordered some flan and macaroni for dessert, but we were too full and just took it to go. Again, both dishes worth its pricing.   My only complaints would be the pricing of the iced tea which is a drink we both ordered. $2.50 a cup and no refills.   Although it was the lunch rush (around 12:30 pm) there was only one server, no complaints there however, he was very hospitable and service was quick.   Overall 5 star review for a great experience. Those looking for a taste of the Philippines should find their way to this restaurant. Kalesa tasted like home to me. And that, I think, is one of the highest compliments."}
{"text":"Service was bad, the food was bland, and we wait d 40 mins. For our food to come. Baddd!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here after seeing the video that we came across FB. Experience here was a nightmare! Not sure if they rush our food or what but the kare-kare we ordered was way watery, the beans were still hard. The lechon kawali was still raw!!! It very upsetting. Even the sprite was water down. Not sure how this kind of restaurant still in business. Please improve your service and the quality of your food."}
{"text":"Ordered:  Palabok, $11.25 4 pork bbq at $3 each.  They tasted good but expensive for what it is.  Pork skewers were not worth the $3 price; consisted of six small pieces of either dry or fatty pork.  Palabok was ok."}
