{"text":"There were so many gluten-free pastries; for the first time in a long while, I felt like a (celiac) kid in a candy store-like heaven. As I also have nut allergies, and I wish there were more signs or indications of ingredients -- but all around amazing and I would absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious. We (gluten free and non gluten free people) tried 5 different things. You must try this place even if you don't have celiac disease. Additionally the staff members were incredibly patient and friendly with our excitement and all of our questions."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat sweets but I had the chocolate mini cupcake and I ate the whole thing in probably a minute.  It was that good."}
{"text":"Perfect for people with coeliac disease. The home-made bread for the grilled cheese is amazing. You also have to try the carrot cake and the cookies. Would recommend anytime."}
{"text":"We loved everything about this place! My newly GF daughter and I traveled to Montreal for her birthday and are so glad we found them!  The people were friendly and helpful - even responding to emails as we were planning our trip.  And the food was delicious - particularly the double chocolate cupcakes, the pain au chocolate, and yes, the grilled cheese!  As good as any bakery, and not just a good GF bakery!  A \"must-stop\" for any GF traveler looking for something sweet in Montreal!"}
{"text":"For my birthday I was given a gluten and sugar free carrot cake.  Fantastic, delicious, excellent are just a few words that the people who tried it used.  No one could believe it was gluten free as they thought it was the best carrot cake they had ever had.  I could not agree more. Cookie Stefanie you have a fan forever.  Thank you!  I can't wait to try your other delicacies!  I was also informed that the price was incredibly affordable!   How can anyone not want to support this kind of business.  Reasonably priced and incredibly delicious food.  My new favorite bakery!!"}
{"text":"Je me suis rendue compte il y a peu de temps que j'étais intolérante au gluten... Au début, j'ai pensé que ma vie était finie! Mais non... j'ai simplement remplacé les pâtes par des pâtes sans gluten, le pain par du pain sans gluten.   Le plus difficile: le pain croûté (je rêve encore en couleur de peut-être en trouver éventuellement) et les desserts! Trouver des recettes de desserts sans gluten peut être compliqué.... Les recettes ont toujours 1000 étapes et contiennent une tonne de farines différentes que je n'ai pas nécessairement à la maison... Les résultats sont souvent denses, peu moelleux...   Je passais dans le vieux-port et je suis allée faire un tour chez Cookie Stefanie dont j'avais entendu parlé comme étant un endroit sans gluten. LE BONHEUR! Des brownies super bons, des cookies délicieux, des cupcakes à toutes sortes de saveurs (variant régulièrement), des cakes. etc. Tout était bon, moelleux et cochon. Honnêtement, si vos amis sont dégoutés à l'idée de manger du sans gluten, ne leurs dites pas, ils ne verront pas la différence!   Il y a 2-3 tables ou il est possible de s'installer pour manger sur place. Seul petit bémol: on entend très bien toutes les conversation des pâtissières tellement l'endroit est petit et pas complètement divisé.  p.s. évidemment, breuvages (cafés, lait, jus, etc.) sont également disponibles."}
{"text":"Fantastic! The grilled cheese with bacon and onions was phenomenal; the bread was amazing. Great espresso and added bonus - they have maple syrup and honey for sweeteners!! And the cookies - tried the mini chocolate which was heavenly. Bought the maple and lemon/ginger to go...maple is amazing, lemon/ginger was eh (but then again I don't like ginger that much). Only down side was discovering them on our last day in Montreal."}
{"text":"I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area.  Those of you from that region or famiiar with it would think we'd have gluten-free bakeries galore, right?  Well, no, there aren't many (there was one good one in Emeryville that unfortunately closed) and one very pricey one in Oakland that I've supported for years, but.....the quality doesn't compare with what I experienced at Cookie Stefanie.  First off all the baked bread is of a higher quality than any bakery or store bought gluten-free bread I've been able to find in Northern California.  The variety of lunch and sweet baked goods available is great.  Haven't tried the grilled cheese yet, but, probably will before I leave town.  Only frustration is that they don't make pizza.  Oh, but for a decent gluten-free pizza...that's probably the item I've miss most post gluten-free life. (hint: check out Pizzeria Bros in Montreal : )"}
{"text":"very good cake with a variety of flavours to choose from, we got the caramel and flower salt one and it is quite delicious and not too sweet, liked the sponginess of the cake part."}
{"text":"The date square is decent and has the right amount of sweetness. The coffee is good.   They have nice high tables by the windows, overlooking Théâtre St-James. The person at the counter was very patient and helpful.   The washroom is clean, but it is located on another floor. You have to go through the main building."}
{"text":"I never would've thought to go here with it being gluten free but so glad I did. Stopped here on an Old Montreal food tour and tried their carrot cake. It was absolutely divine and we made sure to stop by before we left Montreal to pick some carrot cake for the road."}
{"text":"Eh bien, je dois dire que je suis très contente que Cookie Stéfanie se trouve juste en-dessous de mon bureau. Ce n'est pas nécessairement bon pour la ligne, mais ça aide à garder le moral lors de semaines de travail chargées.  Cookie Stéfanie est une petite pâtisserie qui prépare des délices sans gluten (et certains sans produits laitiers). Elle prépare aussi, depuis peu, de bons grilled cheese.   T-O-U-T est délicieux. Voilà, c'est dit. J'ai eu l'occasion d'essayer presque toutes leurs petites douceurs, mais mes coups de cur restent toujours les mêmes : l'excellent muffin bleuets et Nutella (plus spécialement le matin, quand ils sont encore chauds!) ainsi que le gâteau aux carottes. Le service est toujours très professionnel et les employés vraiment gentils. Quant aux prix, c'est un peu plus cher que dans une pâtisserie ordinaire, mais les produits sont tout de même sans gluten et sans produits laitiers.  Ah, j'oubliais. Cookie Stéfanie prépare aussi des lattés et des chaï lattés complètement fous! Si je m'écoutais, je m'y rendrais certainement chaque jour... Hihi!"}
{"text":"Everything is gluten free! I liked my greek yoghurt with apple sauce & granola. Bf had the duck & sun-dried tomato & grilled cheese sandwich and it was also very delicious! Coffee was great too!"}
{"text":"A lovely spot in Montreal for your sweet-tooth cravings! Cookie Stefanie was the second stop during our food tour and boy was this place a necessary visit! We were given the gluten free carrot cake as a sample. As soon as we all took our first bite, we were so shocked our eyes widened the size of the cake. None of us thought we would actually love something gluten-free (no shame). We immediately started planning when to visit the store again in order to buy some to bring back home. Long story short, we eventually did go back and brought a few boxes back?  We didn't get to try any of their other desserts, but they sure did look delicious. This place is conveniently steps away from the Crew Collective Cafe. Make sure to pay it a visit!"}
{"text":"The variety and deliciousness that hey offer is mouth-watering! We walked in to the fragrance of a savory focaccia bread or pizza being prepared. Despite that temptation, a sweet treat was appealing due to the time of day and small appetite.   Delicious, assorted gluten free favorites are so tempting and appealing. We bought some to eat there and more to enjoy later. Yum."}
{"text":"What a gorgeous little store - if you need gluten-free treats, you should absolutely head here.    It's not cheap, but the stuff is really wonderful and a treat for the eyes as well as the stomach."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker and there was such a huge selection! I got a gorgeously decorated holiday cookie, along with a coconut bar which was amazing. Cute atmosphere and friendly staff too."}
{"text":"A cute little place that has a ton of delicious gluten free options. The general vibe of this place is calming. A nice place to sit with your yummy treats and chat with friends. My friend and I had cupcakes and a chocolate covered treat with icing in the middle. Top these treats off with a cup of tea and we were in heaven. It is a nice place to go if you are intolerant to gluten or have celiacs disease as everything made is gluten free. Service was fast and there was enough place to sit in the back of the cafe. They also offer many different types of tea and coffee. Definitely going back to try their cakes."}
{"text":"I have tried cookies sold at fou d'ici on de maisonneuve w (place des arts metro): they were all good (chocolate, lemon & ginger, dark chocolate and maple), except for the chai latte one which had a very strong, funky taste and smell.   I am still eyeing the Reine Elizabeth cake, as well as the carrot cake!  Definitely worth a visit if you are on a gluten-free diet and want to treat yourself to a guilt-free dessert :D"}
{"text":"This place is a gluten free heaven! I'm not GF and I loved this place. I love their homemade version of their ding dong. It is just divine. The bread they use for the grilled cheese is a little thick but their carrot cake is so moist and a must try."}
{"text":"So delicious I couldn't even tell it was gluten-free  I also like the format, there are mini cupcake samplers ...so I can indulge and try different flavors without eating too much dessert  Wish there were more chocolate themed ones  The hours are pretty limited, like most businesses on St. Jacques  I prefer Cookie Stefanie over Les Trois Glaceurs, because the cupcakes are delicious and gluten-free  I don't have a gluten intolerance, I just find it less heavy"}
{"text":"Was happy to find a Gluten free bakery that tasted like heaven. Had the carrot cake n let me say wow it's mind blowing. The staff is so friendly. Only said I didn't buy a whole cake. Lol"}
{"text":"Having celiac disease, I absolutely love this place. It's fantastic!  The brownies are great, along with the carrot cake, muffins, and the coffee isn't bad either.  Perfect for anyone suffering from celiac disease or is gluten intolerant.  The price point is perfect.    Did I mention they have grilled cheese sandwiches?  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Oh my my my!!! The carrot cake is a MUST!! So very moist and delicious. I'd order the same thing next time, and I never do that."}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to enjoy a sample of their carrot cake on the Local Montreal Tour. When I tell you it was the best cake I've ever had, I can't even emphasize. The icing was rich & light. The cake itself was melt-in-your-mouth & offered an array of new flavors for a carrot cake. Omg soooo good"}
{"text":"We ambled in here to hide from the rain before catching a show. They have an assortment of treats: from cupcakes to brownies and muffins to bars; and they also have grilled cheese sandwiches and melts as lunch offerings.   The staff was very friendly and let us sate our visual appetite before recommending us the carrot cake. Now, between this being a gluten-free shop, and myself not being a fan of carrot cakes... I confess I had low low expectations. But the earnest enthusiasm behind her recommendation sold me.   And thank god for keeping an open-mind, because what a carrot cake it was! Each bite a perfect balance of soft moist cake and cream cheese frosting. Nothing like the dreadful 'healthy-tasting' mushy mealy stuff I feared. No sickly sweet thick frosting to cover a mediocre grainy dry texture. No, this, this is the carrot cake par excellence. The one carrot cake! I am a converted.   The 5 stars is purely for the carrot cake and service. We sampled nothing else as I didn't want to contaminate the lingering heavenly carrot cake taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Cookie Stéfanie is an Old Port bake shop that is actually relatively affordable to most people who don't have money to blow, something atypical for the area. Specializing in gluten-free goodies, I was curious to see how they would measure up to their ordinary counterparts that I'm so used to eating.  The atmosphere is very stylish and has pink undertones, and all of their baked goods are lined up very neatly behind the glass display case. Since they also had grilled cheese at the time that I went and added a new type, the duck confit with tomato, I decided to try that along with a Queen Elizabeth cake and a cappuccino. After having my food brought to me, I tried the grilled cheese first. Honestly, I didn't find it all that impressive, especially given the fact that the filling-to-bread ratio was more in favor of the bread, and the flavor and texture of the bread felt like it was overpowering the duck. It didn't really feel like it was worth spending the extra three or four dollars on. The Queen Elizabeth cake, however, was much more impressive. It was nice, moist, and filling (but not stuffing) despite its small size. The coconut topping added an interesting layer of texture when added in with the nuts and everything else in the batter so it didn't taste too saccharine. The cappuccino was well-made and actually balanced out the sweetness of the cake, so I might just order those two items next time.  For what it is, Cookie Stéfanie definitely does gluten-free right. Although their grilled cheese doesn't measure up to the usual grilled cheese, their baked goods have the potential to give their counterparts a run for their money. Seek it out if you have the time!"}
{"text":"Cute little place in old town with a very attentive and friendly staff. The carrot cake is to die for and the espresso is delicious. The grilled cheese melts in your mouth. The chocholate cupcake is really good too. I wish I could try more of their sweets, but I ran out of stomach space. This place is also part of a walking food tour, but keep in mind that they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Super découverte de cookie Stéphanie qui propose des repas et gâteaux sans gluten :-)   Nous avons pris un grilled cheese, un gâteau au carottes et un muffin au bleuet.  Nous avons pas été très convaincu par le grilled cheese mais les desserts étaient vraiment très bon.  Je recommande ce lieu"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe they are gluten free!!!  The citron ginger cookie is so good.  Just the right (healthy) sweetness, not like many cookies that are way too artificially sweet.  I can tell they use high quality ingredients.  Their date square is also good.  I can taste the freshness of the dates used in the square.  Very happy that I tried this bakery.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend after work for dessert. It's a gluten free shop right in old port.   They have all kinds of cakes and cupcakes in minis and large sizes. I really enjoyed their cupcakes for a gluten free dessert. They have many options of tea, which they serve in pretty mason jars. They also have savoury options. It's a fairly small place. They have high chairs  and tables for you to enjoy and sip on your drink. The artwork is beautiful. Service was good. Would definitely stop by to pick up a dessert in the future."}
{"text":"Super cute little patisserie in Old Montreal. We went in on a whim and bought a mini cupcake (salted caramel chocolate) and a cherry bomb, both of which were delicious, cakey and chocolatey. Could not tell that either were gluten-free. We went back the next day for a light breakfast and ordered the banana loaf and pain au chocolat. The banana bread was a bit dry but the pain au chocolat was fantastic- doughy and moist, again you could not tell it was gluten free. Coffee was ok. Ordered muffins to go (cranberry pumpkin) and they were also quite solid."}
{"text":"I do believe this is the one place in Montreal we went to twice during our week-long visit. And how could we not? Go for a visit, try one little bite of anything, and I bet you'd be a repeat customer as well.   Long gone are the days of gluten free baked goods tasting like cardboard. Plenty of people and places have figured out fabulous recipes that won't leave you disappointed, and no one should write off Cookie Stefanie just because it's a dedicated gluten free bakery.  On our first visit, Adam and I shared a coconut, chocolate, and nut cookie bar that was amazing. Incredible balance of flavors, sweet but not too much so, with a heavenly melt in your mouth texture. The toasted coconut was perfect and the bar was plenty big to share. It was wonderful paired with our espresso, which was one of the best coffees we had on our trip.   During our second Stefanie trip, we opted for something savory. Grilled cheese. And oooohhh my god you guys.. Most melty, cheesy, gooey, fat sandwich you ever saw. Seriously... They grab a HUGE handful of shredded cheese and smush it in-between seriously good GF bread in a panini maker. It's all messy and perfect. I ordered mine with bacon and onions, which elevated it to a new level of wonder.   There's all kinds of beautiful baked good here from muffins, to cookies, to bars, to pastries, to brownies. Great coffee menu and juices as well. Prices are probably a little higher than your typical bakery, but nothing outrageous and definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"I didn't love it, but I'm not gluten-free. I'd give it 3 stars, but My GF friend says 4. Everything is GF in the entire restaurant, which is a real plus. They had a number of delightful-looking cookies, cupcakes, and bars, plus grilled cheese sandwiches. We each got a grilled cheese with bacon, shared a Mexican rice salad, and had a date bar to share.  The date bar was excellent! It was a crunchy granola top and bottom with a thick layer of dates between. Yummy!  The rice salad was pretty good - nicely flavored, fresh and crunchy veggies. Unfortunately, the rice was a bit crunchy too. The only thing I didn't really like was the grilled cheese. I felt like everything needed salt - the cheese, the bacon, the bread. Plus the bread's consistency was weird, but not if you're GF. :)"}
{"text":"I definitely give this place five stars for the cookies.  However, the cupcake and grilled cheese weren't so hot.  The staff members were incredibly nice and it's a quaint place to sit and have a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent sweet treats, Kusmi tea chai lattes, and coffee!  Free wifi and excellent, friendly customer service.  Definitely recommend stopping by for a snack or to try one of the grilled cheese sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying I came by request of my wife who is a celiac, so her input will also be noted. The decor is vibrant but the same, unfortunately, cannot be said for the staff. Upon walking in and saying hello to one of the employees we were met with a look of confusion. Ordering was a rather erratic process with the cashier jumping between the grilled cheese press and the register for each individual order. That is not to say, however, that he was unpleasant; just rather disconnected. I do not have a gluten-free diet so I have not quite adjusted to the flavours and textures of most of those products.  I ordered the classic grilled cheese and upon arrival it looked fantastic! Unfortunately I just couldn't get into the bread, it was a bit like cardboard, the cheese was a completely different story; melty rich and delicious. My wife seemed very happy with hers (she ordered the bacon grilled cheese) and tried a bit of mine. As this visit was mostly for her I asked if she'd want to go back again, she said it wasn't bad but wouldn't want to go out of our way to go back."}
{"text":"Best carrot cake we've ever had. You must try!  We came here as part of a food tour. They have a cute little boutique full of cupcakes and other delectables."}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. It was ok, the bread was a bit off, but was to be expected with gluten free dough. The people were extremely nice and the store was inviting. I'll make sure to try something else next time, because I do want to come back."}
{"text":"Got the fleur de sel caramel cake.  To break it down:  Fleur de sel - fine Caramel - can't go wrong Cake - ugh. hated it.  Made with chickpea/garbanzo flour, and it tastes like it.    Never going to try the cakes from here again. Might stop in for another grilled cheese someday if I'm nearby and need lunch."}
{"text":"Gluten free cookies! Really! And they taste great! It can be so hard to find GF restaurants, let alone ones that offer dessert, so we stocked up on these cookies and have been enjoying them in our hotel room. My husband liked the maple chocolate chip, and I highly recommend the lemon ginger!  We stayed in the shop for a late lunch of grilled cheese; the daily special of duck confit was good, but the classic with bacon was amazing.  Also, the pain au chocolate is irresistible! Don't expect the croissant style typical in France-this is more like a small loaf with chocolate throughout and large sugar crystals on top. Summary-if you are GF, definitely go here when in Montreal. Even if you aren't GF, you will enjoy these tasty treats!"}
{"text":"When you are cold and hungry, this little cafe seems like a utopia!  Try the grilled cheese, with plenty of cheesy goodness.  Finish off with any of the wonderful sweet treats.  Not a huge space, but grab a stool by the window and indulge your gluten free sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here during the Old Montreal food tour. I was originally disappointed because I hate gluten free baked goods, often dry and hard and with completely wrong texture. But the carrot cake completely changed my view! It was moist, soft and oh-so-delicious! I'm now intrigued by gluten free baking and intend to try it out myself!"}
{"text":"So happy we found this place!  Everything we had was phenomenal and reasonably priced for a dedicated gluten free bakery.  We got the grilled cheese,  Nutella blueberry muffin, and apple cinnamon cake for around $10, and they were all delicious. The staff was also very friendly and helpful with helping us decide.  They have cookies, cupcakes, muffins, bars, a variety of coffee, in addition to take home cakes and loaves of breads and granola."}
{"text":"You know when you have really high expectations for a place and then they don't deliver... Cookie Stephanie isn't that. In fact, it over-delivered!   With some of the best grilled cheeses in town and a huge assortment of desserts, this has got to be one of my favourite Old Port lunch spots.  Bonus points for gluten-free bread."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find.  The food is very flavorful and fresh.   The prices are very very good. Everything is very affordable.  We tried an assortment of muffins and grilled cheese sandwiches and they made for a very filling and satisfying breakfast.   Simply put, everything was very delicious. My favorite was the Nutella muffin with blueberries. There was a nice dollop of Nutella in the middle.   If you are avoiding gluten, this is a must try."}
{"text":"Yum!!! The chocolate cookies here are so amazingly delicious that I really wish I bought more than one. The cookie was perfectly crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside. Also tried the brownie with walnuts and the little apple cinnamon loaf. Both were very good, but the cookie stole the show!  This shop is located right behind Le Westin, where we stayed, which was very convenient. I just wish we had discovered it earlier in our stay so I could have eaten more cookies :)"}
{"text":"I came in here for breakfast and coffee. I ordered a bacon grilled cheese sandwich and a cappuccino. Both were good but unremarkable. However I loved the friendly service and the cafe itself. Perfect place to lounge, read a book or get come work done. They have power outlets and a comfortable seating area. Plus their prices are really good. Worth stopping by for a casual coffee or snack."}
{"text":"Excellent Gluten Free place!  Grilled cheese with bacon and onion was amazing!  Muffins and the carrot cake are very tasty!  A must try if your in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but would not return because of the poor service. The girl behind the counter was one of the rudest I've ever encountered. I'll take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"This is my \"morning spot\", on my way to work I usually stop by to buy one of their tartines or salads. Their cherry chocolate mini cakes are to die for literally, I had to restrain myself from buying it because I would eat them non-stop. Their mini muffins are super cute and so is their coffee. Cool place to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries!  My favorite is the \"Le Reine\" which is a date cake with coconut topping.  Everything is really good, except the bread from the grilled cheese sandwich needs a little work with the texture, it is a bit gritty.  Your store is currently closed on Sunday.... please open your business on Sundays!!!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find a gluten-free bakery during my trip to Montreal! The woman working there was really friendly.  I had an absolutely delicious open-faced smoked salmon sandwich with a flavorful dill sauce, cucumbers, and pickled onions.  The mini raspberry cupcake was perfect for dessert; the frosting had a great consistency and the cake was just right.  The interior is feminine and upbeat; it was the perfect place to stop for a quick gluten free lunch."}
{"text":"The cookies are fantastic - chocolate, chai, &/or lemon ginger."}
{"text":"We got a couple of things. Firstly, a giant chocolate dome that was like a slice of chocolate cake covered in icing. It was super moist and something like a ho-ho glammed up. Your will power will be extremely challenged by it. Also loved the date bar. Overall excellent GF pastries and must say, their to-go salads are great as well (try the brussel sprout or the bean salad). Clean cute shop, but in general not much atmosphere here, so take your cookies to go."}
{"text":"Delicious gluten free cakes, cookies, cupcakes, and grilled cheese sandwiches!  I wish I'd come hungrier to try more things!"}
{"text":"Patisserie coquette avec des prix selon le choix des ingrediants santé. Deco rose et girly."}
{"text":"Some people might be afraid to try gluten free foods I admit I use to be . I've come to Cookie Stéfanie for  lunch had a salad called  \"super Bol Au Poulet\" it was pretty good for just being a salad after eating it I felt proud and satisfied for eating a healthy lunch , most of the time I eat junk so it was a nice change . For 8.50 which can be pricey for a salad to me the taste and size is worth it . I also had the grilled cheese with pork and to me for 7.50 it was good but not worth the price I've had better or just good for a lot less. If your looking for a healthy lunch try their salads you won't regret it."}
