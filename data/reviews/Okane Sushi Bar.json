{"text":"While the food shines at this sushi spot, the problem with Okane is the service.  The waiters attempt to be professional but fall short on many levels.  If you want to have a pleasant experience, I suggest you go in with low expectations about the service and with a little bit of time on your hands (conversely, if you go in late, you can expect to be rushed out the door).  Service aside, their rolls are consistently good and tasty.  I've been eating here for a few years now (on and off) and it looks like the sizes of the rolls have beefed up since the opening of the all-you-can-eat Kanda restaurant that opened up further down the road.  This is probably a good thing for most people, but I prefer having dainty makis with one slice of avocado opposed to three.  Either way, I probably shouldn't complain because you'll end up getting more yummy for your money!"}

{"text":"Slow service. Mediocre food. Not authentic sushi. They had canned tuna in one of our rolls. First and last time eating there."}
{"text":"Eh- proof that horrible service will ruin any meal.  We come into this sushi place after a long hot day outside.  The server seats us and because my cousin recognizes her from her previous job at a restaurant further down the street, the server takes this as a hint to get overly friendly and comfortable.  She proceeds to tell us how this job is less stressful and that she makes more tips here (and tells us how much) b/c it's a different clientele, though she feels she never makes alot.  We've placed our order and we watch as people around us get their sushi, as well as people who come in for takeout get theirs.  Time's ticking and finally, we get the rolls we ordered, but not the sashimi...we devour the rolls and tick...tick...what seemed like an eternity later, we get the rest of our food.  The sushi itself is very fresh and good.  After we flag down the suddenly disappeared server for the check, we wait another 10-15 minutes for the check.  She proceeds to hover over us and take about how cash is better than credit cards, as we're trying to divy up the bill...so rude.  No wonder she doesn't make alot of tips...what an awful waitress."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! The sushi pizza was amazing and the Okane salad was so delicious! Service was great too!"}
