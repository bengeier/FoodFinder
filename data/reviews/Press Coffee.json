{"text":"This place is great. Came into town for one day for work and had their coffee and breakfast food. Coffee is amazing, nutty and lightly tart. Perfect way to start the morning. Menu was simple, delicious and easy to choose from. Vibe in there is quiet, cool, light jazz music playing. Perfect place to work, study or catch up with a friend in a quiet atmosphere. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and even better breakfast!
However the exterior entrance has needed cleaning for a long time..."}
{"text":"What a great place. I love walking into beautiful coffee shops that make me feel welcomed. I feel like thats rare now a days. This is the second of their location that ive been to and youl can see the passion the company puts into their product. Decided to have lunch with a friend at this location and it was delicious! There were different avocado toasts to choose from, i had the BFT (super delicious btw) and my friend had the bacon burrito. All the portions were surprisingly decent for the price. The staff was very helpful and didnt mind any of our questions, and didnt even try to rush us when other people lined up behind us. It was very comfortable. I will be back whenever I am in the area!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here around 11am for coffee and a nosh and it was a pretty busy place with comfortable seating. My amigo got a black coffee and some kind of pastry. I got a cinnamon bagel with cream cheese and a cappuccino. The coffee tasted like a strong French roast, but with calm overtones, not too bitter. Once I tossed some Splenda in there, it was smooth sailing. 

(The only reason why I've given Press 4 stars vs. 5 is because I'm an Italian roast person, and wasn't really fond of the coffee flavor overall. The coffee preparation was excellent, with a little heart and extra TLC. No complaints there!)

We chatted it up for 3 hours. Both of us brought our iPads but I didn't have any Internet connection. He found one but it's name didn't sound official, so I don't think Press offers free Wi-Fi. I'm not 100% sure but I wouldn't count on it.

The atmosphere was very trendy, North Scottsdale w/a largely Millennial clientele. The staff was friendly and helpful and I'd recommend it if you're in the Scottsdale Quarter and are in need of a strong pick-me-up.

I wouldn't call this place easy on wheelchair/powerchair users. It's pretty tight for seating and ordering, but there are tables and chairs outside in front of the store.  If it's not too hot, you could park there for a spell."}
{"text":"Over the course of two years I've stopped in here twice. Both times I find the coffee good, but the atmosphere uninviting.  At least four young guys are idling behind the counter. Neither a smile, nor a greeting for me on either visit. There are too many good coffee houses (Hava Java, for one) to waste time and money patronizing a place with arrogant servers."}
{"text":"I've had lattes all over town and surprisingly this was the best one I've ever had. 4 stars because it wasn't hotter than the surface of the sun. Delicious and beautiful!!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite coffee place! I have yet to have a drink from here I did not really like and they have great pastries and other food items! They also have dog friendly outdoor seating available!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best coffee place in Arizona! Sam and Maddie were so nice and very knowledgeable. I ordered a dirty iced chai latte and it was perfect. Couldn't ask for better customer service! Will be returning very soon and would strongly recommend."}
{"text":"The super cute barista with tats and blue eyes is way chill, in the southeast Portland sort-of-way!  It's refreshing to find some peeps who don't look like Kevin Federline and are genuinely friendly & helpful. 

The ambiance is a chill, post-modern meets restoration hardware esthetic.  Great flavored coffee roast & perfect break  around the corner from Apple & H&M, down from AX. DEFINITELY worth the walk across from Kierland Commons."}
{"text":"This place/coffee is the best. My wife and I buy a bag of their Twitch blend every week. It is hands down my favorite blend for making a latte. We also stop in on occasion and buy one directly because it's the only place I've found that doesn't burn/over-steam the milk. Very friendly barista's, and a very clean facility. The only thing that would make it better is a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"As a coffee snob and frequent traveler, I was surprised and delighted to find such excellent coffee in the Phoenix area.

Quality roasting with a barista staff that understands and values great extraction.

I had an excellently balanced Ethiopian coffee through the Kalita Wave brewing method. The Kalita is essentially a far better performing V60. 

I'd recommend this place over several more well known places I've been in NYC, Chicago, and LA.

Thanks Adriana for a great coffee experience!"}
{"text":"Sweet Mother of Coffee, this place is as close to heaven as it gets.  5 Stars is not nearly enough.

I'm a 20 year-old college student.  I've been drinking coffee for more than 10 years and my life would be bleak, depressing and flavorless without coffee.  I've had my share of different coffee, grinds, mixtures, add-ins, you name it.  

I had made it a personal goal to try as many coffee places when I moved to the valley, and it so happened on a dark cloudy day that I made my way to the Scottsdale Quarter to pick up a friend who was working.  I was bored, tired, and impatient.  Suddenly, I smelled coffee.  I made a beeline to this place and my nostrils were engulfed, upon entrance, by the sweet, tantalizing smell of caffeine.  I ordered a large vanilla latte, an average every-day order made utter perfection by the barista.  

10 years of coffee, good and bad, were suddenly made null by this undescribable cup of latte.  Other cafes are nothing in comparison, Press Coffee is as good as it gets.  I sat there, unaware of my surroundings for what seemed like hours.  Pure bliss.  I walked out, not noticing people, or things, just reliving the taste and the feel of that vanilla latte.  

Bee-Tee-Dub, the staff is also amazing.  Totally friendly and devoted to everything coffee.

I can still remember the taste.. is that even possible?"}
{"text":"The shop is small and high quality, set in an affluent mall.
Loved the shop. Hated the mall."}
{"text":"I was never really a true coffee drinker until I was able try Press coffee.  I'm not sure if it is the local artwork on the wall, very friendly staff, quality of the product or the breakfast sandwich that I like the best.  All that being said, my mornings now start off with Press coffee beans at home and when we are able to we stop in for a quick cup.  The outside environment and overall vibe is impressive and makes it easy to want to come back!

Love This Place!!"}
{"text":"Finally I discovered a good coffee shop that is not Starbucks down the street from my house. The coffee here is legit, I had to look up the brewing methods up on my computer after I walked in--I didn't even know that coffee could be something more than burnt beans steeped in water made by some frantic, underpaid kid. 

Oh, but it is so much more than that.

The ladies working today were awesome (I came in on a Friday at about 2:30pm), very friendly, and hustled. 

Glad to have the free wifi, some fresh squeezed OJ, and a tasty delicious coffee.

I am giving it 4 stars, however, for a couple reasons: 

1) they don't make their coffee in glass cups for stay-in orders, and all of their silverware is single-use plastic. I get that businesses do these things for convenience, but I KNOW you have a sink in the back. It's the 21st century and I think it's time we get with the program and cut back on the single-use disposables when they aren't really necessary.

2) I was disappointed with my yogurt parfait. Listen, I get it. This is a coffee shop. MY first mistake was expecting the parfait to be as good as the coffee. It came in a plastic cup with Yoplait yogurt and the granola was a crushed up Nature Valley bar, or something very similar. For the price of over $4, I would really have liked some REAL yogurt and REAL granola without all the HFCS/sugar. A girl can dream, can't she? 

I will know to order something different next time. 

I couldn't help but laugh at some previous comments regarding the \"douchebag\" location. I grew up in this area, so I feel your pain. The a-holes in their Lamborghinis, spoiled children, and plastic robot women are aspects of my going-out experience I would love to do without. But, this is where money is to be made and they sure do make some great coffee. 

4 stars. Make a better yogurt parfait and cut back on the single use disposables!!! :P"}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop. Top flight grinders and espresso machines. Friendly staff. But...don't serve a double espresso with almost no crema AND THEN TAKE THE TIME TO DIAL IN THE MACHINE while your client is still in your establishment drinking your subpar coffee!"}
{"text":"Looking for that one of a kind find ?? Don't look in the press, head over to the press , \" Press Coffee \" that is 

Stop by and visit this great find hidden in the heart of ocotillo , awesome friendly staff, yummy coffee and did I mention burritos??? They are  so good they make you want to slap your momma 

Remember presses dont stop at the gym , \" Smart Gym \" that is , is not the only place for press,  this team can certainly handle their own."}
{"text":"Simply superb Americano! 
Travel all over the world and this is definitely at the top of the list"}
{"text":"This is bad... this place is right across the street from where I work and I fear I will spend all of my money here.

Sosososo good. 
Great Soy Latte!
I wish they had bigger sized cups because it soo good."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great coffee and espresso. Come often enough to explore the menu!"}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee and espresso, very friendly staff. The iced teas are great too."}
{"text":"Unfortunately had bad experience this morning. Red headed guy was not friendly at all and continued to be rude to me after he got my order wrong. Couldn't even say sorry or thank you. I won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to Peoria from Tucson 
I would drive an hour and a half to come here everyday if I could. 
Nitro was poured into a chilled glass - dope. A little watery but still awesome. 
Espresso was very solid too - get the Ethiopian!
Baristas were super helpful and patient with us. Even gave us some recommendations for other food spots to try out
And I love the layout - black and white - so good"}
{"text":"On behalf of my grandparents: they love this place. They visit once a week, and have been doing so for years. Great customer service, cute place, awesome location, and the coffee, according to them, is perfect. I'm not a fan of coffee, but they also have great teas and fun snacks and pastries that might entice you. Big fan of this spot :D"}
{"text":"This review is not based on the service here but rather the fact that I couldn't go here. I went at 6:45. They didn't open until 7am. What kind of self-respecting coffee shop opens that late? So I can back the next day at 7... it was Saturday and they didn't open until 7:30!  It's this a coffee shop or a bank?"}
{"text":"Best coffee I've ever had. Just wish it wasn't in the Quarter. I'd go everyday but parking can be a nightmare."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my latte made with 1/2 the regular amount of almond milk. Waiter was a bit rude, not crowed at all for a Saturday afternoon/night. Would suggest a more friendly atmosphere, good latte, too expensive. Overall would say its a good place, would never be a regular here though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in downtown Ocotillo. The staff is always so nice and accommodating. The customer service is stellar. Hands down the best iced chai latte I've ever had. We will be coming here often!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Arizona - We need more locations the valley!"}
{"text":"We were here near closing time and the staff closed the door on customers wanting to buy and rudely kicked out customers who had just purchased coffee.  Must have been in a hurry to get to their St. Pat's party. I grew up in the world of small business and we never closed the door on paying customers. Their coffee might be good, but customer service not so much."}
{"text":"Make sure to stop in if you are in the area. This place is incredible from the service to the product. I love their coffee so much and it is always in a new design of their coffee art. Its cool to have someone take the time to make a $3 latte instead of herding you in and out like Starbucks has become accustomed to. Money well spent! Free wifi too and make sure you grab a snickerdoodle cookie before you leave."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee! No snob vibe here just really legit beans. I would love to see this place take a larger hold in the valley. Cold brews I'd totes legit and macchiato is perfectly wet"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I am in love with the Twitch coffee bean they offer.  The coffee is smooth, no bitterness and styled to perfection.  The service is great, they pour your latte/cappuccino personally for you.  There's a Starbucks on every corner, it's nothing special, but there's only ONE Press!  I would drive across town for my Press....and I have!!  Hey when ya got a hankering for a twitch, ya gotta go!!!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Scottsdale - the food is solid as well.  Start with a pour-over coffee and make sure you seek the opinion of the barista when selecting which beans to brew.  In addition to providing exceptional single-cup pour-over coffee options, the food delivers.  My egg, cheese, avocado sandwich on spout bread was an outstanding breakfast.  They could use a few more tables and chairs inside, however, when the weather is not too hot the outdoor seating expands their options."}
{"text":"I am on doctors orders to give up caffeine.  This is not good for someone who likes a great cup of coffee.  I'm not a fan of decaf coffee and have never had a good cup....until now.  I love their decaf cappuccinos.  They taste rich and delicious and.not at all like decaf.  

It is out of my way to come to Press, but I think it's well worth the extra trip to come there.  Love the place!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. My Iced Americano was average - a bit weak. Vibe in the store is clean. 4 instead of 3 stars due to the friendliness of the staff.  Coffee = average. Feel of store = average (in this day & age of coffee shops - fits the Quarter very well).  Staff = great.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We are from California and stopped by this place on our way through the valley. My wife and I loved this place. GREAT coffee."}
{"text":"I'm really starting to like this place a lot. My go to is definitely the iced vanilla latte. It's literally perfect. It's not too sweet and you can still taste the espresso. The only reason why I haven't rated it five stars, is because I've only been here a handful of times and I keep getting the same thing. When I venture out of my Latte box, I'll re-evaluate my review."}
{"text":"Very cute little place in the middle of Scottsdale Quarter, especially like the foam art on the hot drinks!! I really think the extra small hint makes your day better :p 

Coffee(espresso) is to the bold side, always try to have a hazelnut latte for a new coffee place I try, so there goes for a bit of differences, lol... The place has a very simple decor with a few art pieces on the wall, sofas and chairs/tables are at choices. 

The only thing I'd ask more is a better menu maybe? The menu on the blackboard definitely isn't enough for a first-timer, you gotta ask what kind of syrup they have and other extra stuff, but I guess pretty much all coffee place have similar things? Just ask if you aren't sure..."}
{"text":"They roast their own beans, so the espresso has amazing flavor!  It is impossible to go back to Starbucks after having coffee from Press on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Was in the area on business and did not expect to step into one of the best in the West.  I travel often and will drive long and far for great coffee.  I've sampled the best in the Seattle, San Fran, LA and New York and this place ranks near the top if you're looking for quality coffee experience. 
 
I ordered a breakfast burrito and cappuccino.  The burrito was piping hot and perfectly balanced between contents and wrapping.  Unlike burritos that blend too much cheese to confuse the quality of the ingredients, this modern version of the classic is a very modern Panini wrapped interpretation of the classic that possessed just the right amount of contents.  All high quality and made with precision.

The cappuccino was lovingly prepared.  The ratio of milk to coffee was perfect.  The grind was both smooth and robust.  PCR exceeded expectations on every level and I look forward to sampling their full coffee menu."}
{"text":"As a fellow coffee roaster I always enjoy checking out the competition. The first thing I do is look to see how clean the shop is. Very clean, nice. Then I order a double espresso and sit down and try to get the feel of the place. The place was full, music wasn't too loud, baristas were busy pulling shots, pour overs etc . Different crowd than my desert hills patrons. You could tell they were there because the coffee was exceptional. I then focused on my espresso. You can always tell if a roaster knows there craft by the espresso. The nose, extreme chocolate with a hint of fruit. When it hit my mouth, my taste buds exploded. It went down nice and the buzz was smooth, nice after taste.
I moved out here from northern Cali 4 years ago and have been in the business for 20 years. I did most of my training in the Olympia,Seattle area. Most of coffee shops I have visited in the Phoenix area have been average at best. Press is exceptional and if great espresso is what you seek, this is your place."}
{"text":"I am no coffee connoisseur, but one can clearly taste the difference between chain coffee places and this place,  the coffee tastes fresh, they make it how you want it, and it tastes a lot richer. The staff is very friendly and are knowledgeable in everything they sell. The vibe of the place is very relax and inviting.  I recommend it specially if you need a break from the shopping at the quarter."}
{"text":"Good coffee, not as good as Starbucks, in my opinion, and certainly nowhere near Ibis coffee. But the staff is friendly and it's a great place to work on my novels and people watch."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee! Oh my god, we both lived it. Took cuppacino and latte. Both were very tasty. We had to ask for extra hot though. We didn't have to ask for extra shot and neither needed sugar :). So yummy!"}
{"text":"Every time I go into this location I get a wonderful response. Parking is free and easy there, music isn't loud, the people behind the counter aren't pretentious and are extremely knowledgeable. I value good coffee and they have some of the highest rated beans in AZ. They really showcase the respect of coffee and the passion for it. They are always willing to answer my questions and do so with the confidence of someone who wants to just spread the love and passion. They have a great food menu and is one of the only breakfast places in central phoenix that you don't have to wait in line to eat. They open at 6:30 so you can order your food to go even. It's always super clean and polished. In fact, I've been to other press locations, and they all seem to hold up this standard of respect and responsibility. 

I want to finalize it by stating that it is more attention detailed and calm and real than your average corporate coffee shop. They don't give you that fake customer service (where you leave the place wondering if they were actually nice or just fake nice) that most corporate places give you. They also don't want you to feel like you'd rather have that fake nice. I don't think they've ever given me small talk and I thank them for that. 

Press has been one of those real experiences in a city full of fake smiles. 

Thank guys"}
{"text":"These guys know their coffee. C3 coffee a few doors down has nothing on these guys. I drive down from Desert Ridge just to taste their beans! Their Latte is great, smooth, and tasty. Do yourself a favor and give them your business so they can stay in business and keep providing such great coffee."}
{"text":"Would give it 5 stars if they would open earlier.  It would be great if they opened at 6 am instead of 7 am.  I am an early riser and I need my morning fixx early. ;-)  Good coffee and espresso!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee at this location! Not sure why, but this location tastes the best to me...better than the other locations. The lattes are delicious! Perfect coffee spot to hang out- great environment, great baristas!"}

{"text":"Great location in new Scottsdale's newer retail shopping center. Decent coffee."}
{"text":"I love personally critiquing & finding the perfect cappuccino place for myself, and Press is my latest obsession!  
Get your cappuccino in a real cup & enjoy the experience done right every time."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops in Chandler. 
The ambiance, service, and beverages are superb."}
{"text":"Coffee is amazing! Staff is very friendly and knowledgable. I wasn't sure what all the fuss was about now I know. Simply a great coffee shop the really cares about serving the best. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great cold brew and wife said they made the best dirty chai she's had. Also, great location it is in and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really great coffee at this place. The chai is the best I've had in the PHX area so far. The service is always friendly here. Their Instagram account makes me feel like coffee way too often!"}
{"text":"After having a latte at press coffee it's hard to go back to drinking coffee from anywhere else. Peas has been my coffee of choice since the first time I went there 2 years ago."}
{"text":"BEST COFFEE I HAVE EVER HAD! Man, I wish I lived in Phoenix! This coffee is the bomb. I discovered them two days before I left Phoenix and went both days for a yummy almond milk latte. The guys who work there are fantastic too! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!"}
{"text":"These guys know what they're doing! They offer different brewing options: V60, Chemex, Clever, and Siphon, as well as French Press. The baristas will take the time to explain each step to you, so you can really appreciate the science and artistry behind each cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I love Press!  My husband and I come to this wonderful coffee shop quite often, most of the time for breakfast, and we love every minute we get to spend here.  I came across this coffee shop back in 2009, I think, when my husband was away with the military.  The friendly staff and comforting atmosphere kept me coming back daily to read or write.  This place really helped me through that time while he was away, and when he returned home, we started going to Press together.  I can honestly say I have never had anything but the best experience and service here, and even when I worked at another coffee shop in the valley, I would come here to find quiet, yummy coffee, and the comfort of being in a place you genuinely love.  Steve, the owner, is so kind and always has a smile on his face, even when it is crazy busy and it must be stressful.  I can proudly say that this is MY coffee shop -- the place that I love, the place that I always revert to.  What can I say, I'm a big fan.  :-)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff without the fake forced feeling. Purchased to-go bottle of cold brew that is available for hubby. He gave a thumbs up. Tried the Banana & Nutella bread - was great. I had a Vanilla & Caramel Latte. Delicious!  I would visit again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This place does it right!!!  We enjoyed our delicious cappuccinos served in real mugs, not the paper cups we have unfortunately been conditioned to accept. We had the avocado toast with 2 poached eggs, all prepared perfectly and served on nice dishes, rather than paper plates that most places serve. Awesome friendly staff!!! Our food came out promptly! Great prices!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I love Press. Outstanding coffee, especially the espressos and machiatos that I love. Every cup I have ever had here has been wonderful. And, it does not have that annoying \"we're so cool\" atmosphere that, unfortunately, seems to go along with great coffee.

But: I with they gave more attention to their whole beans offered in the Scottsdale store. I buy a couple of pounds frequently for use at home, and on more than one occasion I have been chagrined to arrive home and notice that the roasting date was more than a couple of weeks in the past. I suppose it is my own fault for not checking the beans in the store, and I now carefully do that. One package of espresso that I bought recently was almost one month old! Shocking for a place like this that prides itself on freshness."}
{"text":"Visiting from Vegas and every time I'm in Scottsdale I have to have my Press Coffee! Quality is great and the staff is friendly. They need to expand to Vegas!!! I would be there everyday!"}
{"text":"Great coffee place and even better coffee!  The employees are extremely knowledgeable.  Go to a cupping, you won't be disappointed...such fun!"}
{"text":"A must stop for the coffee snob.   We visit AZ a lot and make sure we are able to swing by.  If your into craft coffee and attention to details- this is it.

{"text":"Stopped in on my way to work, walked in and said, \"how's your iced coffee?\" Like I'm some coffee snob- I'm not, i'll drink starbucks of mcdonalds any day. I'm offered the cold brew, I accept.

Not even halfway thru, I start feeling jittery- so holy smokes this cold brew has some caffeine! The flavor was great, perfect coffee flavor, with the bitter bite curbed down with a little bit of cream/sugar. Simple syrup, actually, which I normally don't care for, but it was fine. 

A medium was about $4.50, which is more expensive than other places, but you are paying for quality coffee that gets the job done. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Decent coffee, helpful staff.  I work at the Scottsdale Quarter so I visit Press regularly.  I don't particularly enjoy their brewed coffee as it has a funny after taste but I do enjoy their expresso. Their Apple Pay was broken and I didn't have my wallet so the cashier allowed me to pay later, great customer service."}
{"text":"Visiting from North Carolina and stumbled across this place.  Much better than Starbucks and great service!"}
{"text":"Every bit as good as their City North store. The Chai is fabulous and their Ethiopian coffee is off the charts too. Finally there is GOOD coffee in that part of town."}
{"text":"Every bit as good as their Scottsdale Quarter location. Products are consistently good between both locations which tells me their baristas have all been trained properly. If you don't know what to order talk with the baristas. They have many different types and they roast it locally so it's always fresh."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great coffee! And this coming from a certified coffee snob. My hubs agrees, and he is equally a snob of the coffees. His policy is that nothing is ever worthy of 5 stars, because everything can improve. I'm giving this place 5 stars. He didn't argue with me. He got a latte - hot - and so pretty! I got an iced vanilla soy latte. The roast is smooooth with no bitter aftertaste. Makes for great coffee. Before I head out, I'm picking up a bag of ground to cart home to Tulsa with me."}
{"text":"Perfect Chai Latte.  I bought the chai they use for home off Amazon and I still cannot quite get it perfect like they do.  I love the service  and kindness of the workers.  Great experience all round."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Press is a part of my daily ritual. Large coffee every morning before walking into work."}
{"text":"Coffee is good.  Ordered poached eggs and bacon - the egg WHITES were uncooked and the bacon was 80% fat and uncooked!  Had to dump the entire thing, uneaten, in the trash. What a waste!!!!!!!!!!!  COOK THE FOOD!"}
{"text":"Never heard this place till I came to Arizona. I didn't want to get the usual Starbucks coffee, I wanted to try something different and I did! I got the 16 oz Iced Latte and it was pretty good, the taste was alright BUT it's okay because I didn't ask to put extra flavor/fake syrup like Starbucks. When I come back to AZ I'll be back to try something different but for now, this place gets a solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state.  I've found probably THE BEST coffee!  Visited 2 different locations and had the same outstanding coffee!  Worth checking out and trying!"}
{"text":"A month old, this Press is very spacious and comfortable.Nice place to hang while reading or playing cards. The nitro brew is good as is the citrus iced tea. Bathrooms are clean and modern...unlike every Starbucks I've ever been in."}
{"text":"Press Coffee does it right! They have consistently been my favorite place to get coffee for years. Whether I'm in a hurry or want the perfect atmosphere to hang out and enjoy a cup. Their product is top notch and their staff is off the charts knowledgeable and friendly! They recently revamped their breakfast menu....It's unbelievably good - breakfast burrito and avocado toast are by far my favorites. So excited to see Press Coffee expanding into Chandler so even more people can enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love the pour over at this place and the environment is clean and inviting.  Great place to get some work done."}
{"text":"Stopped and got a latte and cappuccino while at the quarter. Definitely some of the best coffee I've had in a long time. Staff was very pleasant and it wasn't over crowded. Great place to sit down and have a cup of coffee while shopping."}
{"text":"4 stars for coffee and a zucchini muffin. 2 stars for ambiance. Not a cozy place, but had a delicious latte with a barista styled heart in my foam!  Love that touch!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I recently attended the Press Coffee Tasting on Saturday in the Scottsdale Quarter. Our host Alex was superb and I learned more about coffee and what it takes to go \"bean to cup\" than I ever thought I would. 
So what is a coffee tasting? We spent a little over an hour together learning the origins of coffee, nifty terms like the \"Bean Belt\", and how to participate in a process called \"cupping.\" We learned the intricacies of different flavor profiles. Honestly, my appreciation for coffee grew tremendously in that hour. 
The best part of the experience was the coffee. Alex pour us their most recent drip brew from Kenya while we participated in a cupping exercise with four different regional coffees. With a \"normal\" cup of coffee, I use sugar and cream, but felt no need to add anything to the perfect brew Alex served. Remarkable! 
I would highly recommend this experience to anyone who likes coffee, but wants to know more. A great way to kick off your weekend. Thank you again to Alex and the team at Press. You have a new lifelong customer."}
{"text":"Cool place for yoga moms and hipsters. Kind of a long line but it's very popular for a reason, and the coffee was great. I had a breve latte and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Truly handcrafted coffee beverages! Their Chai is award winning and to die for!! Yum!  Parking is nutty at the Scottsdale Quarter. I'd go there every day if parking was better!"}
{"text":"When I saw this inviting structure as a new coffee shop in the plaza, I could not wait to venture inside with a friend.  But to my disappointment, the \"barista\" was too busy talking to a coworker to welcome us when we walked in.  I noticed exuberantly priced, small bags of coffee for sale.    As I looked up at the menu board, I felt like turning around and walking out the door.  But, now I was inside; let's try the java!  I was trying to get hyped - after having sticker shock, ordered a small coffee, and waited for the magic brew. I saw this mini dixi cup size of coffee in her hand, and....yep!  She sat it down on the counter, in front of me.  I looked over at my friend, then at the paper cup, then up at the lady.....in disbelief.  I was thinking to myself, \"Hey?!  Wait a minute!  I just paid $3 for a sample cup of joe?!  A paper cup....tiny...$$$?! . Then, 
I actually LOL! . Although I tried to mind my manors, this was one of those times when I couldn't hold back.  

If your brave enough to go, be sure you're ready to pay up, and take a pillow for your tush.  The metal chairs are brutal if you plan to sit and talk. ?

{"text":"If you're not a straight coffee drinker, then most of the offerings here seem to be and taste like every other cafe; nothing extraordinary or special. Although, I have read other reviews about some of the coffee roasts being fantastic. I do appreciate the location of this cafe because north Scottsdale could use more upscale cafes. The remodeled interior here is less-interesting than I thought it would be. I'd prefer to see some sort of greenery in here so that I don't feel like I'm working from an IKEA display box. $5 caffeine, $3 sugar pastries, and so-so $6 carby burritos... this place is more about convenience and less about substance."}
{"text":"Great great espresso - I typically get espresso or an americano, totally worth waiting in line for, I just wish they would remodel and align the point of sale with the flow of customers, sooner or later I have faith, the remodel will be worth it, the espresso is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Friendly and efficient staff. The Costa Rican brew is a very good morning coffee. The food there looks great. I haven't had a chance to try it but I plan to soon."}
{"text":"Best Dirty Chai I've ever had, silky and smooth. The prettiness was an added bonus. Thank you."}
{"text":"Smooth coffee. Loved the flavor. Great service! My new favorite place for coffee! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best lattes I've had.  What great people that really care about doing things right."}
{"text":"This little coffee place is so good. I loved the coffee as well as the customer service here. Everyone seems to know coffee and love what they do. The avocado toast was excellent. 

Great location to just relax and enjoy coffee."}
{"text":"Best place in Tempe to grab a coffee and hang out. Quiet for the most part, free wifi, plenty of seating, super friendly staff. If you live at Skywater at Town Lake, they will even bring coffee to your apartment! They have everything from lattes, to cold brew, to iced tea.

Food: Press is perfect if you are in need of a quick bite for breakfast or lunch that doesn't taste like a \"quick bite\"! Their breakfast burritos are bomb. Everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Press Coffee Roasters, and can't say enough good things about the coffee, the food, and the staff.  Any time I'm near Scottsdale Quarter, I stop in and get an iced mocha, and my only suggestion would be to offer a larger size because they're so good!  I've also had the breakfast burrito with the chipotle sauce, and it's excellent.  The staff remembers customers and is friendly, with quick and accurate service.  Definitely my favorite coffee spot in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Glass mugs! Nice spot for a meet up with friends for outdoor seating when weather permits."}
{"text":"So good!! Coffee is excellent, love that they have stevia (a lot of places don't). They also carry caketini cupcakes- which are also amazing! Avocado toast is recommended. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am comfortable in this place. I found the ambiance adequate, plenty of outlets, nice sidewalk seating. Ive read in other reviews of mean baristas but I didnt experience that. I was greeted friendly and with a smile....of course I am really good looking and nice so that might be why or those others were gross and smelly. Anyway, I would add this place to enjoy a coffee when in the area."}
{"text":"The coffee is quality as well is their tea. The wait can be a little long but that is because you aren't getting some half assed drink. Good espresso takes time! Can't say too much for the food, I've had a grilled cheese here once. I usually go for the cold brew or iced tea here but on a blustery day try their pour overs or a chai."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick pick me up. 

The cashier working at the time was extremely friendly and helpful in helping me decide what to get. I ended up getting an iced mocha and it was great! Would have preferred less ice, but it tasted wonderful.

The place is really quite and peaceful. Also really pretty! Definitely recommend coming here just to relax."}
{"text":"Great spot for an early morning spot for coffee.  Expect the line to be long after 8am but if you get there early and grab a spot outside you can beat the heat and do some great people watching before all the stores open for the day.  Really liked this place for a short business meeting I had when I was in town on vacation.  Both the coffee and organic green tea were excellent."}
{"text":"Great vibe and nice selection of beans. Friendly staff. Only 4 stars because of parking."}
{"text":"I know some people love this place but I have tried several times now and just don't like it for a few reasons. Regular coffee is bitter and the service is a bit odd, like they are recovering from the prior evening. Checked out at counter and i was presented with an ipad to click one of three giant buttons on how much of a tip i wanted to leave, which i thought was a bit obnoxious. I prefer their competition C3 down the street. However if you want authentic coffees I think this is the place for you. They are all about coffee."}
{"text":"I am used to some good coffee roasters in L.A. so I am a little picky.  It was o.k., but nothing above average.  Latte art - check, nice Scottsdale Quarter mall - check, great taste -  meh....could be better,  friendly employees - check.  Not sure where roasting is done because I could not see it or smell it on the premises.  I did not feel an indie/hipster vibe as Jessica M. stated.  It seemed like run of the mill Starbucks to me."}
{"text":"They have great coffee and expresso.  It's very urban and trendy inside with the good \"cool\" coffee shop feel.   

Try:
- Mochas ( Iced or Hot )"}
{"text":"I live in the SkyWater Apartments currently so they are a stop for me largely for convenience. They have a small menu for food but it serves up your standard American breakfast fare. The coffee is great and they sell their cold press coffee in bottles. My old office had a cold press coffee machine so I've always been a fan of the stuff. It's a good way to start the day with a light breakfast and some nice iced coffee. No frills and certainly not particularly special but serves its purpose."}
{"text":"Four of us arrived around 11am on a Saturday.  We were interested in pour over coffee and they had a selection 5 beans to choose from.  The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about the beans.  They had beans from Africa and South America.  We also got a blueberry muffin to share.  They didn't have many goodies at this time a day.  The blueberry muffin was wrapped in plastic wrap and not in the case with the other remaining muffins.   It was good, but a little dry; maybe yesterday's muffin.  The coffee was quite good and the coffee shop was nice and located in a pretty area.  We look forward to returning on our next visit."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband the week it opened we get to try their drop coffee for the first time.. we really liked it! It was a blistering hot Friday afternoon and was packed inside and had to drink our hot coffee outside :/ but still was a pretty good experience they also have half off day old pastries we had the banana muffin which we also enjoyed and would recommended"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing latte! Perfect balance between espresso and milk. Staff was friendly and helpful without an ounce of snobbery."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Everything is good, but the chai here is the best I have ever had in my life. I cannot recommend it enough. The staff here are incredible kind, the service is wonderful, and it's a really great vibe! Lots of vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"If I'd live a bit closer, I'd frequent this place. Needed a cup of coffee and boy did I get a good one. Okay, I bought 2. A tiny tiny espresso and house coffee. I need extra caffeine since it will be a long night for me. Thanks guys! I'll be back. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I come here often and they always  tell me they offer free refills but I never get them.  So today  I  brought my coffee cup back that I bought this morning and they said they don't offer refills on cold brew I was very  disappointed that the employee  this morning lied to me. Well I  end up  buying a new coffee. It would be nice if they change that in the future or don't give customers a misunderstanding.  Well other than that this is a nice little shop I'd say more positive if I hear back."}
{"text":"They have good coffee but when they first opened they would have fresh croissants, I guess that is not the case anymore."}
{"text":"I need to start by insisting that I'm no fan of labels. They always fail to adequately describe their subject. Yet, no matter how hard I try to dodge them, a few consistently stick. I've been called a: hipster, foodie, coffee snob. I don't wish to fill ANY of those shoes, but I would like to focus on the last one for a moment.

COFFEE SNOB:

I place full blame for this particular label on Press Coffee. Why? I'll tell you why. It's because Press has RUINED me for \"lesser coffee\". The PHENOMENAL difference evident in the quality of Press's coffee has set me on the realest of personal journeys. **Press is what taught me how to begin appreciating coffee for coffee.

Before tasting a Press Coffee pour-over, I drank my coffee \"light and sweet\". That's just how I knew to order coffee and it's what I knew I liked. It was quite a big leap to taste a coffee \"black\". But I did, and I've never been the same since.

Now, when I make my own coffee at home, I employ everything I've learned since that first taste of \"real\" coffee: I use Press Coffee beans exclusively (of course). I hand grind those beans. I pour over or I AeroPress or I french press. I drink the coffee black and savor the profile of that specific bean.

Since that first taste of Press coffee, I have visited every coffee roaster within reasonable driving distance of Phoenix. While there are several notably delicious options nearby (Cartel, Cave Creek, Cortez, and Royal to name a few), Press Coffee Roasters still sits comfortably at the top of my list.

I introduce friends to Press Coffee any chance I get. I order enough to share with coworkers. Sometimes I even bring my beans and gadgets into work with me just to share the delicious aromas and flavors with my team! I love coffee; but I am IN love with Press coffee.

ANOTHER THING:

The service. I cannot express the depth of my personal satisfaction with the type of service I can always expect at this location. The baristas are ALWAYS happy to help with recommendations, always excited about their brand and always SUPER knowledgeable about their coffee and techniques. Nowhere else have I come across such creative, passionate, and competent baristas.

ONE OTHER OTHER THING:

The atmosphere. This location recently underwent a complete remodel and the finished product is utterly stunning. Considering the small space they occupy, the setup is ingenious and warm and inviting. I love everything about it. I'm confident you will, too.

DISCLAIMER:

Forgive the flowery text of this review, but I really do mean every word. Press makes some of the very best coffee around and, if you haven't yet been to taste this for yourself, you're SORELY missing out. Stop by some time, tell the barista that you'd like to try a pour-over, and let them make a recommendation for you. It will change your life. I'm serious.

***WARNING: Experiencing a Press Coffee pour-over will RUIN you for any Starbucks or Dutch Bros. You may even find yourself walking around with a big \"COFFEE SNOB\" tattooed to your unwitting forehead. (But I assure you - it'll be worth it!)

NOTE FOR PRESS:

Press Crew, you people rock. Honestly. I couldn't be more pleased with the results of your hard work. I look forward to your smiles and passion every time I walk through that front door. THANK you for being so consistently wonderful. Especially you, Elizabeth.  ;)"}
{"text":"Press Coffee has been my #1 favorite locally roasted coffee supplier for years now. It's rare for me to visit the coffee shop without also grabbing a bag of their beans. In fact, Press might very well be responsible for turning me into the coffee snob that I am today...

I'm giving Press Tempe a four star review only because the service here has been SOMEWHAT spotty. Never horrible - never even bad. It's just that barista's here have often seemed somewhat... distracted. NOT a huge deal, but I prefer employees who are in LOVE with their brand. And Press is DEFINITELY a brand worth being excited about, in my opinion.

Apart from this minor detraction, the overall experience is satisfactory. The Tempe location is new and bright and modern and (usually) clean. Not far from where I live, so a great place to bring the laptop and work.

Food is only just ok. And only barely that. But I never come here for the food, anyway. Where Press excels is the coffee, so I prefer to stay focused on that.

If you haven't been, it's certainly worth a visit. Press Coffee is the brand I choose any time I wish to introduce my non-snobby friends to \"REAL\" coffee.  ;)

Good job, Press. Thanks for yummy coffee!"}
{"text":"This has to be the most overrated coffee establishment on the planet. The service is SO BAD - rude, careless people serving horrible, bitter, funky tasting coffee. I give it one star only for the above average baked goods, but this place is not a bakery, it's a coffee shop and the coffee sucks!!!  I hate to say it, but you're better off at Starbucks!! At least they are friendly!!"}
{"text":"Went in today, only got a double shot but it was on point! The staff was incredibly sweet & inviting. I will be returning :)"}
{"text":"A very sophisticated ambiance which is welcome in North Scottsdale. This is the kind of joint I would have expected in San Francisco and I'm very pleased they are here. The coffee is excellent, and the service was very friendly. Will be happy to return."}
{"text":"First time here, and wow! No joke some of the best coffee I have ever had. My iced caramel macchiato was perfect! Adorable place in the heart of the Quarter. Lots of tables, friendly staff and super clean. Also had some great food options. I will be back very soon for the avocado toast and for one of those delicious looking cupcakes."}
{"text":"Press is located in the Scottsdale Quarter and is a great little spot for something quick and delicious. 

They have excellent coffee - my \"go-to\" is an iced mocha with skim milk. IMO, the coffee is strong! But delicious. 

Better than the coffee are the breakfast sandwiches and burritos - I love that you add a sauce/spread to the sandwich - pesto, sundried tomato, etc . It really adds a nice element that you don't find elsewhere. Additionally, the baked goods: cookies, breads, and muffins, are all yummy, but also calorie-ful. 

Pricing is a little high but not extreme - really it is consistent with the location being in North Scottsdale.

The restaurant has nice seating inside and outside and offers free wifi (the password is \"greatcoffee\". I think they recently swapped out the soft chairs and couches for regular tables/chairs instead. 

Oh! And they have a frequent guest program... no cards/punches, they just take your name each time you get a coffee and you eventually earn a free one. Make sure to mention it each time, as I have had a few that were missed because I didn't bring it up to the cashier.

Service is normally nice - they get quite busy and sometimes it feels a bit rushed, but never rude.

If you're in the Quarter and looking for a nice spot, definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"Pressed is a high quality local coffee shop that provides a rich cup of happiness every time.

They also have a variety of delicious teas and snacks. 

The location is ideal for studying, quick meetings or a long catch up session.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great location, but never had anything that's really wow-ed me. Their tea is pretty standard and their coffee is a little harsh if you have it black. I actually expected the coffee to be smooth, but was surprised. This was my third. time giving the coffee a chance. If you are looking for black coffee I wouldn't recommend it, but anything with syrups or flavors is probably alright. Staff is fine. The guy with the long dark hair at the register is sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"Always consistently fresh coffee and friendly service.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stars for a delicious almond milk mocha latté! You could have fooled me that this was  nondairy. Also enjoyed a piece of sourdough \"toast\" from a local bakery. This was two huge slices of bread with butter for $3. Very fresh and indulgent ! Cute little place all around with a hip clientele. My only gripe is that the barista helping me was fairly coffee-elitist and unfriendly."}
{"text":"Solid espresso.

Warning--it's hard to get to press if you don't live in the apartments there. We parked semi-illegally to get there."}
{"text":"I never write these reviews and try to give people the benefit of the doubt. This has got to be the worst place to get breakfast in Ocotillo. I really wanted it to be good since it's only about 3/4 of a mile from my house. The first time we went here it took us 35 minutes to get our food and we were the only ones there.  The second time we never got it!  I'm convinced that they forgot the order but they said they didn't. We left and came back and still wasn't ready.  Today my son wanted to go there so we tried it again against my better judgement. I ordered the avocado toast with two eggs and bacon.  The avocado toast came but no two eggs and bacon. They apologized and brought the bacon but they never did bring eggs. Like ever. I cannot tell of course if they charged us for it because they didn't give me a receipt. The folks that work there don't seem very interested in helping either and have careless attitude for sure.  Only the poor cook in back seemed the least bit interested in helping. I would rather starve then go back. I cannot believe it's still in business. They do make a decent Chai but please save yourself a head ache and do NOT order anything to eat. Horrible."}
{"text":"this place is involved in Price Gouging and their products are not even organic."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The workers are all great, both knowledgeable and friendly. The coffee drinks we have had were all excellent, we typically get espresso or Latte. I also grab a bag or two of beans for making espresso at home. The beans have been very flavorful I just wish they had a bigger selection, sometimes they are a week old."}
{"text":"My office is right down the street from this location - super convenient when I need to get a coffee break/small exercise.

Ive only gotten the nitro cold brew from this location. This only comes in 12 oz at $3. 

There are plenty of tables to sit at but this location is usually packed so may not be able to find a spot if you plan on working from here."}
{"text":"Grand opening today at the Chandler location.  FREE cup of their fresh drip coffee- any size"}
{"text":"Finally, there's another coffee shop in the Kierland / Quarter area. Even better it's a locally owned and operated coffee shop with proprietary roasted beans sourced from only the finest corners of the earth. They seriously have coffee from Ethopia that naturally smells like blueberries and chocolate, and this ain't your flavored Gloria Jeans Mall stuff either. I ordered a regular coffee and enjoyed their house blend. I followed up with a sampling of their espresso, made by their machine that is one of eight in the entire US. The espresso is incredibly delicious, full of smooth rich flavor, that finishes pleasantly at the end. This where good coffee happens!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at press...personally I love their coffee, better than most small coffee shops in my opinion...consistency is good..coffee foam on top is also pretty....interior colors could be better, maybe brighter.   The staff are really nice, obviously some are more outgoing than others.  Great location to enjoy u drink with friends or by yourself!"}
{"text":"This is our first time at press coffee, but we'll be sure to be back. The coffee is great! Eggs with avocado and chicken sausage or terrific too!. We also had the grilled cheese sandwich - Swiss with bacon. Also terrific!. Good job, press coffee!."}
{"text":"The good:
Beautiful interiors, and very friendly customer service. I was greeted immediately as I walked in.

The not-so-good:
Entrance is on Central Avenue, heading south towards McDowell Rd, it will be on the right. This is the only entrance that I know of, so make sure you are traveling the correct path.

But most importantly, they only have honey and sugar as sweeteners. Honey is tough in coffee, as it clumps up in cold coffee and has trouble dissolving, even in warm coffee. And granular sugars are the same. If a coffee spot doesn't offer simple syrup or agave syrup- both of which dissolve excellently in both cold and warm coffee-I assume they don't really know coffee drinkers. 

Get some agave, and i'll be back.


."}
{"text":"A really delicious coffee.  We had their cold brew coffee over ice.  Added half and half in mine.  They only had sugar or stevia so I drank mine unsweetened.  Very nice flavor. I would like to try a food item next time."}
{"text":"Spent two long weekends in Scottsdale on our trip. Came to this place for coffee every day. Best coffee since we left Bay Area. Their pastries were great as well. People who work there were some of the nicest we have encountered in AZ."}
{"text":"I will never understand the hype surrounding this place. 

On the many times I've been here, never once have I left thinking 'My god, this drink is delicious!\". Instead I've had multiple encounters with moody baristas and a rude manager who act like they're god's gift to coffee. Well guess what - you're not. In fact, your coffee is not even that great. At least not your espresso, which is the litmus test for any great coffee shop. I don't taste any depth or complexity, which is rather fitting because the shop itself has no depth or complexity. It's all show. It feels cold, sterile, and soulless, especially with the 'remodel' that makes it look like every other trying-way-too-hard-to-be-hip coffee shop.

They are apparently incapable of making a soy latte that isn't 1/3 foam. I asked for a 4 shot soy latte with no foam, and instead, 1/3 of my $6 'large' (which is 16 oz - what the hell?) was comprised of foam. (By the way, what is the deal with coffee shops nowadays doing 2 shots in all the drink sizes? Isn't the whole point of getting a larger drink having more espresso?) I finished my drink and there was still a giant clump of foam on the bottom. When I told them about this, I was informed that 'there will always be a bit of foam'. And guess what? When they remade it, it was still full of foam! 

Now, I've gotten soy lattes at Starbucks multiple times that didn't have ANY foam, and these supposed coffee experts are saying it's unavoidable. You know what you do? You block the spout with a flat tool to stop the foam from pouring in. Simple! I've worked at a coffee shop. It's not brain surgery. And for all the stifling pretension here, you'd think they'd at least do it right. And by the way, every time I've gotten this drink at Starbucks, it's actually tasted better. They use organic soymilk, unlike Press, which as far as I know doesn't use organic anything.

I was honestly surprised to see the use of Monin syrups - I mean really? Monin is not quality. Why would you want to tarnish your product with another that is inferior? I mean, this is Scottsdale we're talking about. For being so expensive, that should be reflectted in the quality of your product. And it's not, which makes this place a huge rip off. Especially when they try to charge $1 for almond milk, or double for doing any less than half ice in a latte! No way I am paying 12 freaking dollars to get a 20oz drink, just so it's not watered down half way through, and so I actually get what I pay for and not 10oz of product because of the ice! Unbelievable!

I think it is very telling when a business kicks out its last remaining patrons a few minutes before closing, forcing them to take their drinks to-go. This is not the attitude of a community shop, nor is it good business practice. You want to instill confidence and loyalty in your customers, not disparagement and a sense of imposition. 

It seems that at the end of the day, Press Coffee cares about the bottom line, and little else. Suffice it to say, I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"The coffee is absolutely awful here. It tasted so burnt to the point that I had to throw it away and couldn't even finish it. The service was not so good either. The girl who took my order acted like I was such a hassle with such a simple order of an iced latte (which is on the menu) with a pump of flavoring. Also, the wait time was too high for one drink. I thought their prices were pretty average for these types of coffee shops, but I think they were a little overpriced. If you're ever in the area, do not go here, I'm defiantly never going back. Any other coffee shop would be 10x better."}
{"text":"I ordered a cold brew, which was pretty standard.  The breakfast burrito was fine but not worth the money given the plethora of cheaper and better breakfast burritos in town.  The staff was very friendly but they only had one guy making breakfasts at breakfast time on a weekend, so it took way too long to get our food.  Two other customers complained about the wait time and got their money back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the feel of this place. The atmosphere is just cozy but bright. 

The food is good, I love the pastries. The breakfast burrito is 4/5. It's good but not to die for. As a tea person I really enjoy that they have some less common teas, sometimes you get bored of the usual flavors. My favorite has to be the jasmine blueberry-ish one (unsure of actual name of tea).

The prices are really the biggest catch.  This is a great place to swing through or even just to work on stuff via laptop. It's never too crowded so the wifi is super speedy."}
{"text":"Came in here for a business meeting at 1pm on a Thursday and it's a great spot for that. 

Pros: 
- Parking (one of the main reasons I chose this over other coffee shops in the area) 
- Empty (it was after finals/graduation so it may be busier during school)
- Great cold brew 
- Friendly service 

Cons:
- Signage ( I got turned around so many times. It could have been my fault because I originally thought it was on the other side of the road then my GPS-Waze App- took me down Hardy and another street and almost to Priest and had me go in a huge circle, rather than U-Turn... Which also partially a GPS issue... but even driving back around, I just asked the person who had recommended it to me because I didn't see any obviously signage, though maybe that is on purpose?)
.... And that's really my only complaint. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"As an update to my last review, though I have not been back, I did want to acknowledge Steve - the owner - who reached out to me and apologized for my experience and said that he has identified the team member that I complained about in my last review (and others have complained too) and he will be working with him to ensure a nicer customer service experience.

Again, I have not been back (I live in L.A.) but I did appreciate the note from Steve, which shows that he is an active and caring business owner and he also included a credit so should I come back, I can have a complimentary coffee, which was extremely kind and generous."}
{"text":"Great place for coffee! I visit every time I am in the Quarter. 

They have Iced Coffee on Tap - yes, on TAP!!! It's great and really refreshing. They said that they way it is brewed, it doesn't get exposed to heat and therefore no bitterness, etc. I may be quoting the process incorrectly but I must stay - WOW - it's great."}
{"text":"I have been to Press many times and have truly enjoyed their coffee until this weekend. We we're travelling by and I wanted a coffee. I ordered Cortado but they wouldn't make it to-go (even though any good Cuban coffee shop would), so I asked for an espresso on ice and they refused to make it. Having ordered this at Press before, I was confused, but quickly straightened out with a \"the owners said iced espresso must now be watered down as an Americano\". Booooooo. If I wanted an Americano I would order one.  You can say what you want about proper espresso making, but I was drinking them in Italy from before the Baristas were born. It's a little bizarre thousands of drinks later to get a we can't do it response. I am amazed when a business refuses to give their customers what they want. But don't worry, there are plenty of great coffee shops in Scottsdale/Phoenix who will get my $$$ and good reviews. Such as Altitude or Village Roasters.  See you later Press Coffee."}
{"text":"Definitely a really cool place to hangout after a nice dinner!  My cappuccino was super smooth! Love the ambiance here and especially their outdoor area. Seems like this is the place to be on a Friday night in Scottsdale, next to a yogurt place and all surrounded with branded stores. What I like most about Press Coffee...  it has a nice local feel inside even though, it's smack in the heart of a shopping center.  I'm a sucker for hole in the wall coffeehouses, and I'd have to say, this was a good compromise.  

Until then, be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p"}
{"text":"Press coffee is nice coffee shop at the bottom of an apartment(?) building. The coffee was good, the espresso was nice and smooth, and the atmosphere was quiet. Definitely not the hustle and bustle of some coffee shops, which is a nice change of pace. Some tables and comfy seating inside. Benches outside if the weather isn't too hot."}
{"text":"Made a coffee stop here after having brunch at Breakfast Kitchen Bar down a few shops down to grab a white peppermint mocha on ice- it was so good! Sometimes when you order drinks with additional flavors, it ends up being way to sweet but this was the perfect ratio of sweet to coffee. One downside is that there aren't many coffee flavors to choose from! The staff was attentive, friendly and quick, we were in and out in about 7 or 8 minutes despite the long line! Other things they have in the shop include pastries (cupcakes, small bundt cakes from Nothing Bundt Cake, and more), snacks (hummus and sandwiches), and bottled beverages (Perrier, coke products, water and juice). Press coffee grounds also available for purchase if I'm not mistaken!"}
{"text":"Coffee is really good. The baristas are top notch. The service is not fast, but it is personal. Which helps make the ambiance so pleasant. The space is small though, so not a huge hangout place, but quaint and enjoyable. I love to drink my coffee from a mug while I people watch. There is a constant flow of regulars coming and going. It's cool to see the baristas recognize their customers and already know what special concoction they need to get started on."}
{"text":"I am definitely a girl who appreciates good coffee, and Press delivers every time! The baristas are always friendly, fun and tentative. I work a few doors down and Press saves my day, everyday!"}
{"text":"Yeah....tried this place on a whim as we were walking by and I needed some coffee for the house; and an afternoon caffiene jolt. The place was very clean and neat, but....if you in any way shape or form like a strong coffee with solid flavor DO NOT go here!

This coffee is weak and watery both fresh from the storefront and when made at home. Even with a turkish grind and extra coffee added to the machine in an attempt to achieve flavor and a kick.

All in all I do not understand these great reviews; in my opinion if you are looking for a watery beverage with little flavor and maybe a hint of caffiene go here.

Otherwise skip it."}
{"text":"I'm about 98% sure I was given hot coffee over ice when I ordered a cold brew due to the fact that the color of my black coffee was light brown and slightly cloudy and others there who had the cold brew had dark and looked like cold brew normally looks. If you run out, tell someone so they can change their order. Hot coffee over ice is gross..."}
{"text":"I did not know what I wanted to get as I'm so on decisive. but the guy was patient with me and he was helpful. I don't remember what I got but it was tasty!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place... Great coffee in the US? Blown away. Perfect espresso from a guy who looked absolutely exhausted on a black Friday makes me excited to come back when he's well rested.  Friend also manage to score almond milk lattes. What a treat! Fun decor,  great coffee, very pleased."}
{"text":"Not bad, the iced coffee is very good. The prices are a bit steep, even for Scottsdale. I wish their was a bit more seating and the seating was a little more comfortable."}
{"text":"Love this place, so glad I discovered it. I get tea there is very morning as well as an occasional b-fast burrito. Recommend this place highly"}
{"text":"Cool coffee spot. $2.97 for a regular coffee with free refills all day long. Has a laid back lounge type atmosphere. Outdoor and indoor seating with a few comfortable chairs. Excellent customer service and some cool snacks/food choices on the menu."}
{"text":"This coffee is so smooth. I could drink it all day every day. Not too sweet and not too acidic. It's the perfect blend. I had a latte and sucked it down so fast-- it was that good. I'd definitely come here again next time I'm in town. The employees are very friendly and patient. Also they have RXBars for sale (the best protein bars ever). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tried the cold brew, was thoroughly impressed.  This coffee shop is located in a really cute location, the interior is very industrial which I found a little cold but that's what they're going for.  A mix of humans... business people, suited up... sweet little hipsters... kids in streetwear... a couple of moms pushing strollers.  Interesting.  So I didn't stray off my beaten path of cold brew too far... I added some sugar free hazelnut & im pretty sure purists would be disappointed but it was very tasty.  My sister ordered an iced chai, that was probably the best one I've ever had.  All in all, great experience."}
{"text":"God I love this place.

I don't know what they do to their beans or whatever or their espresso, but my goodness it's delicious. Hands down the best iced latte I have ever found anywhere. So. Good."}
{"text":"Nothing better than an iced tea with lemonade on a hot day (it's 108 degrees btw) However, I personally wasn't a fan of this specific drink. I think there was just too much lemonade added to the tea. @presscoffee does serve some good coffee though! The coffee shop itself is also somewhat small, but pretty aesthetic (very white). And the building it's in, as well as the rest of the buildings in this plaza, kinda made me feel like I was in Greece... If only I was actually there"}
{"text":"I had an hour wait to eat breakfast at Snooze so my son and I walked over to Press Coffee.  I have been there several times in the past but this was the first time I got an iced latte.  It was delicious but I have been to coffee shops across the country and this was the first time I've ever paid $4 for a latte and had to separate plastic lids and put the lid on myself.  Very strange and annoying.  Besides that, my son had a kids hot chocolate and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"FINALLY. I have been awaiting the opening of Press Coffee for MONTHS and it's finally here. The baristas are friendly, the coffee is on point, and the store is ultra-modisch PLUS it's incredibly close to Tempe Town Lake. I can already tell it's going to be my latest addiction... possibly my downfall in getting to work on time throughout the week!!"}
{"text":"Such a great little place to pick up quick, easy, and yummy breakfast. I would definitely come back. I love it that it's so close to where I live. My family and I ordered multiple things on the menu and they were all so good."}
{"text":"I liked the vibe of this place. It reminded me of a few coffee houses I visited in Seattle. The service was friendly and the coffee was great. Be careful with the \"toddy\" though - it's fantastic but will get you wired really quick!"}
{"text":"Good coffee,tho the wait can be annoying .Their cold brew, and interesting pour overs make for a good experience . If you have a bit of work to do,the noise level is low enough to enjoy coffee and a bite and still crank out that report."}
{"text":"Great coffee, excellent service.  Try the Iced Toddy, it's the awesome."}
{"text":"4 stars for the Yirgacheffe Aricha which is the best whole bean I've had in the valley. 

Changed my rating because I went back after their recent changes to the store and everything was great."}
{"text":"Finally they got pumpkin muffins and now I can give them 5 stars. 

Also love how clean they keep it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a coffee and ended up having breakfast. Best idea of the day. The Burrito was full of flavor and hit the spot perfectly with my iced chai latte. Great service, great atmosphere. Must stop when at the Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and sitting areas. The barista was nice and friendly. I gave this place 3 stars because it is way over priced."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a dirty chai (the best!) and a half order of traditional avocado toast (so delicious).  Sat on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful morning catching up with a friend.  I highly recommend Press to help start your day out right!"}
{"text":"The coffee here is phenomenal! I love their coffee. The smell, taste and aroma of their coffees are unbelievable."}
{"text":"Finally a coffee place that is not a disappointment! Located right on Central Ave so it is a busy street. Parking is free under the garage. Walked in and the environment feels new and refreshing. I love the smell of their coffee. Plenty of seatings and this place is very mellow. I got their White Chocolate Latte and I love how it was not that sweet because I control how much sugar U can put in afterwards. Coffee goes down smoothly and it taste so refreshing. I would definitely be back and try their teas."}
{"text":"EDIT:  I'm now amending this (formerly glowing) review that I wrote when they first opened.  However... three strikes and they are OUT!  First strike:  I was craving a Chai Latte.  They were out of Chia.  Second Strike:  Wanted a Kombucha.  They were out of Kombuca.  Third Strike:  Wanted the sandwich with whole wheat bread.  They were out of whole wheat bread.  My god... there is a Safeway three blocks away!  They've lost my business!"}
{"text":"It's nice to be able to go to a non-Starbucks coffee shop for once! Although these days coffee tweaks me out unnecessarily, so I have to stick with tea for my caffeine fix. They did have this tropical blend for their green tea though, so it was definitely nice to have something new. Aside from that, inside is super clean and definitely attracts people just trying to chill at the coffee shop.

Best part of the place is the service. They definitely go out of their way to make you feel welcome and appreciated for sure."}
{"text":"This is a great place to study or meet up with a friend for a drink. Nice, quiet location, free accessible parking, and friendly staff. The breakfast wraps and croissants are good, as well as their chai lattes.  The decor inside is contemporary industrial style. Clean, comfortable environment with a moderate amount of consumer traffic during peak hours.

What's New: Every Wednesday from 5:30pm-7:30pm they will have a food truck in front of the coffee shop. 

What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Slow service, good coffee. 
Always ask for a real coffee cup otherwise all you will taste is the paper cup that they use. 
Some of there staff is really knowledgeable and can give you great insight into their beans and which work best for your brew method. Other employees don't seem to know much about coffee."}
{"text":"The best coffee ever!   Whenever I am At Scottsdale Quarter, I stop by,  cappuccino is fantastic.. no sugar needed and they make the most amazing design.

I also had Avocado Toast.... yummy!"}
{"text":"I was craving caffeine, so I walked into Press and I tried an almond milk latte from. The latte was high quality, rich in flavor, and made properly. Service was also prompt. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Relatively new coffee shop located on the ground floor of the Skywater Apartment building on Rio Salado Parkway.  Press is clean, bright, and decked out in a midcentury modern--meets--contemporary hipster vibe; I noticed some knockoff Eames chairs (the ones with the \"Eiffel\" base) and retro styled sofa seating.  Confession time: I was not expecting much from the young (to me) barista when I ordered my cappuccino; from previous experiences at other coffee shops with young baristas, those drinks have been subpar, mainly due to inexperience.  When I took my first sip of my drink, I was impressed....then penitent.  I also have to say that the staff were all very pleasant.  :)  The banana chocolate bread I bought to accompany my coffee was really good as well.  I will most definitely come visit again to try some other drinks and snacks!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the neighborhood!  The options for premium coffee in the area were limited to the usual over roasted selections.  I will be a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"Espresso is not just kinda bitter (which would still be a major faux pas) but EXTREMELY bitter. I really, really want to support noncorporate coffee places . But, most unfortunately, with the rare exception, the only place that serve decent espresso is Starbucks. I am constantly looking for reasons not to go to Starbucks but it is just not happening. :("}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, sort of like a local version of Starbucks. Strong flavors, but not too bitter, very smooth. I wish they served coffee in a mug for those of us sitting in."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to get over here since they opened and finally made it this morning for breakfast.  I love this whole plaza.  The buildings have a beautiful Mediterranean feel to them, and it's a pleasure to just stroll around, especially on a nice morning like today.  When we lived closer we were over here all the time to hit Sauce Pizza and Fresh & Easy.  

I knew I liked Press coffee from trying it at the airport location, but had not tried their food options.  All you have to say to me is eggs, avocado, and bacon and I'm there!  I had a mocha, which had a lovely rich flavor, and the avocado toast on sprouted bread with one poached egg.  For an extra dollar you can get another egg.  One was plenty for me.  It was delicious with the fresh avocado crushed on toasted bread, and the yolky goodness spread on top was perfect.

My husband ordered some ginger ginseng tea and the breakfast burrito with bacon, Swiss, eggs, potatoes, avocado, and pesto.  That burrito was fantastic!  We were passing our food back and forth so we could share everything.  It's a little pricey at $25 for those 4 items, but everything is high quality and so delicious.  Afterwards I went back for a $2 snickerdoodle, and that was very good as well.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is nice and relaxing.  I hope to stop in more frequently.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Press, hope you don't switch from awesome urban cookie / Ollie cakes to really not good Caketini.  Oops, too late.  You already did.

At least you have those comfy leather chairs to hang out and chat.  Oops, you removed all of those and packed the place with really uncomfortable wooden ones instead.

Thank goodness your baristas are all really nice helpful folks.  Oops, those folks left and were replaced with hipster kids that seem slightly annoyed to be waiting on you."}
{"text":"Who knew there was affordable cold brew in town? And to make it a nitro was the best thing they could've ever done. I just wish it wasn't attached to the luxury housing but small issue for such great coffee. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Yummy coffee!!
When I stayed in Scottsdale, I'd come here for their goodness.

Definitely a bit over priced, but it's the business now-a-days."}
{"text":"I don't know why they removed their comfortable chairs.  It's like they wanted to make it clear, \"we don't want you to hang out here\".  Got the message, I will be going somewhere else.  Service is very slow and they never acknowledge it.  It seems the people who work there must hate their job, because they are always so moody.  My hubby used to go there quite a bit, now he drives by it, to go all the way to Echo.  I haven't been back in a few months, and I am not planning to go back any time soon or maybe ever."}
{"text":"Solid espresso drinks. Not much seating but the outdoor options were good. Over the course of six days there were a few times when the espresso came out uneven. But in general very smooth and delicious. Fewer options than other high end coffee shops in other cities we've visited (including our local favorite Ipsento) but enough variety to keep it interesting."}
{"text":"Our favorite coffee shop. Everything there is just nice. The place has an open view to the busy street. Lots of tables and a little patio area as well."}
{"text":"Just wanted a small cup of coffee.  Maybe it was old but pH was low enough to etch metal.  The soy milk they added curdled upon impact.  I had one sip and tossed it immediately.  I won't go back.  Where can one get good coffee and not a blended drink?"}
{"text":"Excellent, delicious coffee. I'm always adventuring to experience new coffee stores to drink hot Lattes. So far, I have not found a place that's better than Coffee Press Roasters. Also. Love the friendly staff."}
{"text":"What more can I say -- I love coffee!! :)"}
{"text":"Great coffee with an immaculate modern interior using high-grade architectural materials. They have choices when it comes to what coffee beans you want, which is pretty nice. The coffee is fantastic. The restrooms were very clean and very nice. Will definitely return. 

One thing I wish I could see are more tables with outlets for laptops etc. The outlets were only at a couple of locations which were occupied quickly. We would have stayed longer, and probably order a sandwich, but our computers were losing power so we had to stop studying early."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying that I work in costumer service (Starbucks) so it's automatically programmed in me to be conscious of how I'm treated in other establishments. I frequent other Press locations in Chandler and Tempe and have always enjoyed the environment and friendly staff. This being said, I am extremely disappointed in how I was treated at this location. I asked for a 12 ounce nitro cold brew in a 16 ounce cup with ice, as the nitro does not typically come with ice and I prefer my coffee to stay cold longer. This is a very common request at my Starbucks store (2 miles down the road) and we are always happy to oblige. However, the barista behind the counter seemed to be annoyed with this and asked me if I just wanted a cold brew instead (not the same thing) and then went on to rudely lecture me on why I shouldn't be allowed to add anything to my drink even if I pay for it. The entire experience left me feeling angry with how I was treated and talked down to. I will not be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"Press just reopened after a quick remodel - they advertised a new capability - nitrogen infused cold brew, so had to give it a try - wasn't a huge fan of the cold brew the last time, and, while better with the nitrogen infusion (makes it look and feel like a freshly pulled Guinness), it's still not my cup of tea...er...coffee.

I'll go back to my old standby of cappuccinos or shots of espresso.

Also, love their Twitch beans for the Jura machine at home."}
{"text":"Back again for a great breakfast burrito and a cup of their excellent coffee.  Y'all come by - I'll see you here. Richard
November 2014. And the place is still as good as ever"}
{"text":"I've been to Press Coffee a few times, but first time checking in through Yelp! 

I have to say, this Tempe location is refreshing. It's on the first floor of the SkyWater at Town Lake Apartment building. Aesthetically the place is very calm, cool, and most of all clean. The service is exceptional and the baristas are nice! 

Recommendations: Americano; Vanilla Latte"}
{"text":"Coffee quality is very poor: burned and sour . Service is friendly, but the product is really bad. Disapointing experience."}
{"text":"Coasta rican coffee was very good, and made the wait worth it.

The atmosphere was nice and clean, love the extensive menu, it offers more variety and taste. 

On the downside, there is no public restroom or for even customers."}
{"text":"This cute coffee shop is located in a mall, and since Scottsdale Quarters is so trendy and upscale-y, this place is no different. 

I love the sun light that spills in through the massive windows and doors which makes it a pleasant place to work or get together with a friend. They definitely roast their own coffees here and do coffee well. I got a soy latte and couldn't be more pleased with how it turned out. They also use a trifecta or trifeta ... I am not really into this but it's cool that they try out new ways of making coffee.

The barista was very friendly, and they are trying to expand their menu to include many different kinds of cold brews aside from the one they have on tap. 

I highly recommend this as an amazing coffee spot INSIDE A MALL ... nevertheless. Great find!"}
{"text":"I come here every week to grab a coffee, well an Americano to be exact!  I have found that they have the best tasting coffee and espresso around North Scottsdale. Their espresso is not bitter at all and tastes very smooth. I find it does take longer to make a drink here, but only because the baristas take their time to ensure every pull is perfect. I go out of my way to stop by here even though parking remotely close to Press is not always available."}
{"text":"Met one of the owners while ordering a pour over. This place knows its coffee. They have a roaster in the city and sell it to their separately owned Press Coffee's... good business model. The coffee is all single origin. Did a visit to their roaster and wow... these people know their coffee! I was so impressed I seriously thought about giving up my dream job and just roasting coffee (no sarcasm). I LOVE THEIR COFFEE. It's like... finally someone cares enough to provide a good product and serve it correctly... poured. Ironically it's called press; I'll have to look back into that..."}
{"text":"Great place to grab coffee and chill alone or with friends.  Across from the Phoenix art museum."}
{"text":"Press Coffee Roasters is definitely the type of place to study as opposed to meeting up with friends. The atmosphere is very quiet and work-oriented.
I liked their chai tea latte - unlike most other coffee shops which usually just add cold milk, they actually frothed the milk, giving the drink a very smooth and velvety texture. It was wasn't super sweet, but actually flavorful and not too milky. I also had a chocolate muffin, which I liked a lot. They do have half off baked goods, which I appreciate since they're not creating so much food waste.
Overall, Press is a bit out of the way for me and slightly overpriced for the quality of the product. However, I would return for the nice working environment and delicious chai."}
{"text":"Glad Press opened in the Quarter!  I love their chai.  Try it once and you'll never go back to the Tazo crap at Starbucks.  They also have free wi-fi and friendly employees, which are always a plus.  

And you know what else?  They have a delightfully simple reward program (buy ten, get one free) that only requires you to give your name, which they enter into their system.  No annoying punch cards or scan cards to carry around, no email/login/password, \"registration,\" etc.  What a concept!  

The seating area is small-ish but it wasn't crowded when I was there.  I appreciated the ample outlets along the wall for my laptop.  The only thing that bugged me about Press was the lighting, or lack thereof.  Personally I've never been a fan of keeping the lights off on a sunny day even when it's plenty light enough to see, read, etc.  It seemed like the only light was the natural light from outside, which gave the place a kind of gloomy, headachey feel (in this Yelper's humble opinion!).  I would have appreciated a brighter ambiance but overall, Press is definitely a keeper!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop located in the Skywater Apartments!  The staff was extremely friendly, the selection of coffee and tea was extensive and the space was very comfortable - great for studying or a meeting.  I thoroughly enjoyed the ginger ginseng tea and the blueberry oatmeal - great way to kickstart the day!"}
{"text":"I went to press with the intention of getting an amazing 8oz capp like usual, but wait a minute, they have fresh orange juice?! There's this really cool machine that cranks out the orange juice right in front of you. So, I got an espresso instead and added on an orange juice for the drive home. I'll definitely be back with the family for my oj from now on."}
{"text":"So as the current Duke of Press, I feel obligated to speak on this local gem.

This is my daily fix. From Coffee to fresh brewed Iced Tea and the best Cappuccino Ive had, Press is fantastic.

The staff is always friendly and super knowledgeable about what they serve.

The valley is lucky to have a homegrown business like this to call its own."}
{"text":"Press has some of the best coffee around. Always relaxing with quick service and good vibes."}
{"text":"This place is nice. I haven't tried their coffee but they have my favorite chai in the Valley."}
{"text":"Simple, casual coffee cafe in a mall. While the outside is filled with busy shoppers, inside Press Coffee is ambient and calming. The coffee here is simple with your typical choices + nitro, which I feel is a must for all coffee cafes. No various choices of beans, but I feel this brings out what press coffee does well in their brews.
Only downside, no bathroom inside the cafe."}
{"text":"I love this place! We are new to the Ocotillo area and we are trying out as many new places as possible! I love the location, the décor, the staff AND the coffee! It's not Starbucks and that is a bonus!!"}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops in AZ. I drive by this place to pick up my hot chocolate and turkey panini :) very delicious!!!! The temperature is made perfectly for me to drink immediately. Starbucks and other coffee shops make it too hot to drink right away. Thank you to the baristas for making delicious coffee."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday after getting into the Phoenix area for Spring Training.  After trying the first time, we came back both Saturday and Sunday morning as well.

The cafe isn't large, but it has a cool mix of modern style with antique touches.  They're rocking some serious coffee and espresso tech - Synesso espresso machine and Bunn Trifecta.  The Synesso is the newer version with some automated pressure profiling, and the Trifecta is new single cup brewer with many controllable variables (Water temp, volume, mixing, etc.) similar in purpose to a Clover, but probably functionally a cross between an aeropress and a siphon.  Probably not for french-press lovers, but great for clarity. Needless to say, you only get these things for your cafe if you really care about coffee and quality.

Coffees tried (and preparation):

Twitch Espresso Blend (Espresso) - Brazil Bruzzi, Ethiopian Harrar, Sumatra Mandheling.  Espresso was pulled around ~1.5oz, with good body.  On Friday it was sweet with a slightly earthy finish, while on Saturday it was sweet blueberries on the front with a chocolate and caramel finish.  Espresso was prepared very well, and was particularly good on Saturday.

(Macchiato) - The blend works really well as a macchiato too - milk chocolate with a hint of berries.  One of the best macchiatos I have had in a while - the baristas really know their craft.

El Salvador Santa Ana Si Beria Bourbon (Espresso) - Delicious sweet front, with a buttery and tasty body, and a citrus/orange finish.  Really nice coffee, and great to have two options for espresso.  Definitely highlights what can be great about Single Origin Espressos.

Ethiopian Nekisse (Trifecta) - Ok, backstory. Sometime last summer, Cafe Grumpy in NYC offered an Ethiopian Nekisse for $12/cup. CBS early show even did a segment on it (http://bit.ly/dbvsTO). This is a similar coffee, and its $4 at Press.  If you appreciate lighter coffees with intense, interesting flavors, do not pass this up. Think, its the same price as a mocha as something.  The aroma was flowery, rose, tea, and blueberries.  The taste was sublime - juicy blueberries, with a tea-like quality. Clean, sweet, with great clarity.

Press Coffee pretty much embodies what every local roaster should aspire to be.  Every time we came, the baristas were inviting, friendly, and put a ton of care into their work. I visit a lot of coffee shops around the west coast, and I have to say that my experience at Press was the best I've ever had. Even the owner was friendly and happy to chat. What sets them apart is how they invite people to experience the coffee in a new way and learn about coffee without being off-putting, pompous, or rude.  They're doing a great job of sourcing good coffees, roasting, and getting the information about the coffee to the consumer.

If you drink coffee and live in the Phoenix area and haven't been here, then you need to asap. I only wish San Diego had a place like this - truly a gem."}
{"text":"My espresso was burnt tasting and bitter. I think they extracted at too high a temperature? My husband's Americano was okay though. 

I do like the style of cups they use because you don't need a sleeve when the drinks are very hot."}
{"text":"Everytime I am here, I have a different experience.  Sometimes the coffee is amazing and other times just so-so.  On a recent trip, I enjoyed a Cortado that was full of deliciousness and made me very happy.  Today I was very disappointed.  The corrado was served barely warm and was missing the full flavor I enjoyed last time.  We ordered two orders of the BFT Avacado toast with two poached eggs.  After waiting 25 minutes, one order came out with an apology they ran out of spread and the second order was on the way.  Typically, we would wait until both parties have food before anyone eats.  Expecting warm yummy poached eggs, I suggested my friend enjoy her food while I waited for the second order.  She poked into her eggs and the yolk was hard.  Very disappointed.  After another 10 minutes, my order came out, again eggs were hard.  The avacado spread was delicious.  Very flavorful and perfectly balance.  

This is a place has so much potential, they need to work on consistency.  I have probably eaten here 20 times, and the results are the same, inconsistent, but good enough to bring me back on the hope that the whole experience will be amazing."}
{"text":"My friends thought it was odd when I told them the highlight of my vacation was a cappuccino I had in Scottsdale.  We visited in December and were staying nearby at the Westin Kierland and were just walking the mall. Stopped in for a coffee as it was pretty chilly that night.  The barista was super nice and eager to share his passion for coffee. We were interested in just picking up a half a pound of beans.  I wouldn't expect great help from such a small sale but he had several recommendations and had us smelling all sorts of roasts before we settled on the one we wanted.

I ordered a cappuccino which was probably the best ever, and I'm a pretty avid coffee drinker and try to visit some well known coffee places when I travel. They showed us some of the tricks to doing latte art, which I've since been unable to duplicate on my home machine - we'll chalk it up to not enough frothing power, not operator error :)."}
{"text":"My hot chocolate was taste, my wife liked her coffee as well! Very awesome atmosphere. Awesome place to meet up. Simple and great! Staff seemed quite knowledgeable about the coffee and origin of beans and roasting and brewing techniques!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, good food, good coffee but takes a long time to get a sandwich. The sandwich is worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Jimmy was super awesome! It was 2 minutes past close and he still let us in! Made my night! He made us our Nitro Brew and he had great customer service! Tony checked us out and he was also nice as well! 

They let us put our coffee's together, while they cleaned...and didn't rush us! Super super nice! 

Great coffee and great service so far, for all the times I've come! 

Thanks Jimmy!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is awesome! It just opened  In chandler and I loved it! You should definitely try the tuna melt!!!"}
{"text":"High end coffee in a high end shopping strip and neighborhood. cant say it was the best coffee, but it was good. paid a lot of money for a medium latte ($5). Could have gotten a venti at starbucks, lol!"}
{"text":"The coffee tastes so good. This location is nice, it is spacious with modern deco. It also has outdoor sitting which is perfect when the weather is nice and cool. It is located in Nexa apartment complex and it is by the corner of Apache blvd and Terrace rd."}
{"text":"Meander through the nooks & crannies that make up outdoor mall Scottsdale Quarter & find Press Coffee Roasters. The baristas we spoke with were well-versed in the language of coffee, their passion evident in their strong opinion of San Francisco roasters. Now that's a conversation I like to throw myself into! 

Though the sample of cold brew was extra smooth &  delicious, I needed something with less power behind it. Iced latte flavored with white chocolate was amazing, definitely one of the best iced coffees I've had in a long, long time. Not too sweet, not too bitter; just a very drinkable cool-me-down & rev-me-up in a cup. 

My barista asked, \"whole milk ok?\" & the allure of creamy, full-fat dairy, something I never allow myself for various reasons, was too great to overcome. I love that almond milk is offered, but man -- the power of suggestion *is* a powerful thing, & I succumbed to an ice-cold sip of bliss."}
{"text":"FUN PLACE!  Great coffee and Avocado Toast (protein style) is my fav!  Even have champs for mimosa's!  Winner Winner!"}
{"text":"We were passing through Scottsdale and stopped here based on their yelp rating.  My husband and I both got iced coffees to go.  I got their regular iced coffee which was a Japanese roast.  It was so flavorful and it had green tea characteristics! My husband got their own roast to go which was in a flask-like plastic bottle.  First of all, how cool to buy ready made cold coffee in a flask! Second, it had 2 and a half times the caffeine as a regular coffee and it was less acidic than a normal coffee.  At around $4 it's more than a regular coffee but hey, with that kind of caffeine it will keep you up for hours!!!"}
{"text":"This place has good coffee for a reasonable price (as far as hipster coffee places go). HUGE shout out to the staff who were friendly and welcoming! I really enjoyed them. The biggest reason I docked this is the patio. It faces the parking lot, isn't fenced in, and does not have ash trays for smokers. With such a pretty location, they could have done a lot with this space and just didn't. The other reason being that their WiFi was spotty, and when working was not strong. Which is surprising because I was the only customer there so it wasn't overloaded by any means. 

Will certainly visit again, but perhaps not when I have important online work to do."}
{"text":"Having tried most of the third wave coffee roasters in the valley, I can say this was the best espresso I've had in the city. They are definitely following the current trend toward citrus-y espresso, so if you're looking for something traditional, move along. A recent review complained of an extremely bitter shot- I would recommend that gentleman try another. I didn't get a hint of bitter. My shot was almost overwhelmingly lemon-y, and therefore acidic, but not in a negative way, just like a lemon bar.
I really liked the espresso here and I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Yay!  It's not another Starbucks!  How come it took so long for a coffee shop to open in this retail center?  Good coffee, friendly service, and a few treats as well.  Wish it was a bit bigger with more seating but I'll take what I can get."}
{"text":"I'm not a major fan of their coffee right now -- I'm going through my obsession with The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf at the moment --- BUT they are a delicious alternative to multi-national chains and you can show your support for local, eco-friendly businesses. This is a true coffee shop. 

The shop itself is kind of small and narrow but you can't go wrong with Scottsdale Quarter.

Their hot chocolate is yummy. 

Oh, their logo is awesome."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Press for years now and will continue to do so because they serve a great product and its wildly convenient to where I work. However, after hundreds of experiences here I always leave with the same impression- this place encourages complete and utter pretentiousness. I say hello, I order quickly, I ALWAYS tip, I even bus my own table and yet I'm met with the same curt and cold attitude from the employees. Why is this? I honestly couldn't tell you, but after several occurrences I finally have to put my foot down. Supporting the Phoenix food and coffee culture is important to me. Supporting small business is important to me. I frequent many cafes across the valley and this shop is the only one where I'm intentionally treated and served differently. Perhaps customer service, common decency, and serving the best product you can is conditional here? Who knows. I certainly wish I did because there isn't a single good reason why I should receive this sort of treatment from complete strangers whom I've always supported. With all of this being said, I still encourage people to support Press."}
{"text":"COFFEE - Very good. I forgot what I tried since I went here almost 2 months ago. All I remember is that the coffee was worth the travel of 20 minutes from my house. 

SERVICE - polite and very professional even if they were very busy and intense. 

PRICE - normal pricing compared to other coffee shops nearby. 

AMBIENCE - This shop is in scottsdale quarter. One would assume that the place is a level up in terms of being cozy and neat. If one assumed that, one would be disappointed. In terms of the place, there is nothing special about it. Seats about 12 people at most and that is about it. 

RECOMMENDATION - worth to try this place out if you live less than 30 minutes from it. Go to this place for the sole reason of trying their coffee. If you want to study and actually work on your laptop or ipad, this is not the place to go to since the place is not made for people that stay a couple of hours inside. Lots of people come and go and it is loud all the time."}
{"text":"Tasty, smooth...refreshing.

The only thing I would change is the seating. It is dominated by bar stools with about 4 or 5 single seat couch style seating. This is only really problematic when someone is sitting at one and it's a bit odd sitting next to them when they are engaged in a conversation sitting in the couch chair across from them. There goes the 4 chairs.

I have a friend that cannot get up in the bar stools due to an injury. Therefore, we had to leave and walk around in the heat. No fun, we left shortly after.

Excellent quality however!"}
{"text":"Great coffee with incredible atmosphere. These guys care about their java and their customers too. I had a great experience speaking with Steve the owner. He was stocking shelves and took time to get to know his customers."}
{"text":"I've only tried it once and the coffee was good, but nothing amazing. I also ordered the turkey bacon wrap and it was wayyyyyyy overpriced!!! $9.50 without a side, for a deli meat wrap?!?Sorry.. not worth it. I may try again, but only for the coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent food and coffee.I love their Avocado toast. Be aware though if you are ordering food, often there is only one cook and it can take a while to get your order, but it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I hold coffee in high regard, well above religion, food, and everything else.  So when I find a place that makes a truly fantastic espresso, I'm very surprised.  This is certainly in the top five that I've had anywhere in the world.  When you get a macchiato it is not only made with perfectly thick foam, but they give you a nice design on top for that visual appeal.  


On top of that the shop is well lighted because of the big windows and looks clean and inviting.  I use it for short meetings in the area or to get a little work done, and find myself energized and comfortable when I'm working there."}
{"text":"New spot for me! Press has good parking in the retail space at MUSE. Coffee is good as is iced tea. They have several varieties of avocado toast. The interior is modern but there is a nice little patio outdoors when the weather permits. Customer service is friendly but not over the top. I honestly cannot find fault with them other than it takes a while for the coffee but they did my specific order well. I recommend Press but am hoping that it doesn't clog their parking."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee in the hideaway in Scottsdale Quarter and beats the Starbuck's across the street."}
{"text":"Re-review: I've been several more times since my last review. Today was the best pull I've had anywhere in the last month. So I'm raising my stars to 4. Taste it before you go, but they are proving to be more constant high quality than I originally thought. 
Previous review: We've been here 5x. The first two were wonderful and we were excited that we had found a good roaster relatively near us. Then we had an experience where the barrista added sugar to both our lattes without our asking for it. We didn't taste them before we drove off and were stuck with 2 undrinkable lattes. I could not find a phone number on their site so I wrote an email. The company refunded our money with kindness and little hassle. We returned and ordered 2 lattes again, this morning. They were so sour we couldn't drink them again. It's got to be a really bad pull to make whole milk taste this bad. So there we are. It's a hit or miss game here. My best advice is to taste it before leaving. Clearly it depends entirely on who is pulling the shots."}
{"text":"It's a good thing I don't live in AZ or else i'd be here everyday. Best Nitro Cold Brew and Avocado Toast in town! When I come down for spring training I always drop in!!"}
{"text":"Press consistently delivers with exotic pour overs at very reasonable prices. Today I had the Ethiopian Yirgacheff Kongo brewed with a Kalita Wave. Their muffins and pastries are locally made and very delicious. The only problem with this location is mall parking. 

But their coffee is fantastic"}
{"text":"I always leave Press Coffee with buyer's remorse. I'm finally writing this reveiw because I'm done giving them generous chances and my money. The coffee here is only okay. As a coffee lover, you will find it to be very acidic and biting (coffee can actually be made to taste good and not just \"dark\" or \"high caffeine\"). I guess it's a quarter step above Starbucks quality, but that's not saying much. I'm not even really sure it is better. I've ordered a pastry here once. It was dry and falling apart. I would compare it to a sand castle put together with sugar. The cashier seemed reluctant to get it out. She must have known it was awful.

I would probably be slightly more generous reviewing the quality of the coffee if the customer service wasn't so horrendous. This is a problem that plagues most of Scottsdale, but I still don't understand the practice of being snooty/annoyed at your customers. Maybe the employees need to drink more of their product? I have never seen one smile in the times I've been in here. Most of the time the expressions range from \"what are YOU doing in here\" to \"I'm so bored and I decided to suck on a lemon.\" Last time I was there, I literally did 100% of the talking with the cashier. I find that to be weird in any situation, but it's really bad for a retail/service employee.


Beyond the attitude of the clerks, something weird happens every time I'm in Press Coffee. Once the computer broke down and I waited without acknowledgment while the woman called for help. Another time the clerk stopped me from picking up my coffee so he could take a picture of it. Earlier this year, I had been sitting outside with my computer for a couple hours and decided to get another drink. When I went inside to order the cashier says \"You're having another one!?!\" I wish I would have said \"no\" and left, but I felt awkward and already committed to it.

I'm sorry. I thought you pour liquid into a cup for a living. I thought I was paying you to do that for me.

You don't have to take my word for it. You can walk past Press Coffee almost anytime and find it empty. That is a big indicator as it is the only place to get coffee at Scottsdale Quarter. Do yourself a favor and walk across to Kierland for another option."}
{"text":"Visiting from Orange County, so I was excited to try some new places. This location is a little out of place among the financial buildings, but as long as you follow the signs, visitor parking is easy to find on a Sunday morning. 

I had the 12oz Mocha, and it was same as most, nothing TOO remarkable about it. I'd definitely like to come back and try one of their roasts/pour overs. :)

Fresh atmosphere, TVs available, ample seating for individuals and groups. Overall great vibe."}
{"text":"Press is one of my favs!! They have one of the best matcha tea lattes locally, super bummed they stopped offering it!!! Cool vibe and super friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"I drink coffee and I drink it daily so majority of the time I let quality suffer for convenience and drink the bitter, burned  stomach unsettling coffee from Starbucks.  There are usually between 2-5 Starbucks at every intersection so good coffee shops have been pushed out due to the American love of drive thru's.  ( I am part of that crowd :( ). One thing you can NEVER get from a BS coffee shop like Starbucks is a Toddy if you don't know what that is feel free to blow your brains out cause you have no idea what iced coffee should taste like.  Even the iced americanos which are brewed traditionally are amazing, no bitterness, no burnt flavor, nothing but smooth deliciousness.  The caffeine level of the coffee is also perfect, high like I like it (that sounds funny).  Either way Press is my favorite coffee shop, I was upset when they shut the city north location but I moved and this location is super close now they also have one at Skyharbor so if your trying to stay awake during that flight hit them up.  Honestly way better than Cartel, if you like Cartel Press will blow you away."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered Chai Tea lattes with a shot of espresso. It was the best Chai I have had in Arizona. I wish we lived closer to this coffee shop! We will for sure return, every time we are close. Great coffee shop."}
{"text":"Yes, I've been drinking coffee since I was 16, yes, I'm addicted to coffee, no, I am in no way a coffee snob that can recite all the coffee barista lingo, but oh my goodness, Press = so delicious! I just got a latte, but received perfection topped  with a rosetta leaf latte art. No added, milk, sugar, or spices needed here folks! The staff was very friendly bringing me to the conclusion that I need to visit Press whenever I'm at Scottsdale Quarter. I'd give it 5 stars, but I'd like to try more drinks :)"}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best espresso in all of Scottsdale. My heart belongs to Lux, in Central Phoenix, but this is sooooooo much closer/convenient! 

It has the feel of some of my favorite coffee places in NYC, with that indie/hipster vibe, but seriously high quality espresso. I didn't remember to ask what brand of beans they use, but I know it must be something good because this is some seriously smooth espresso!

I got a soy latte, and just like all of the best places, it's one double-shot, no matter what size you order. I do like that they have a 16oz size just for the people used to ordering a big drink, though. I opted for the 12 oz size and, despite the fact that it was quite warm outside and I was loving indulging in iced beverages while I was back in AZ , I knew that to really get the purest taste, it was best to go with a hot drink.

The owner (?) was also the barista and the cashier. Love that. He was happy to talk to me about the store, and how they had another location over at City North (that place is still around?) before this one. I used to work at a restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter before any other shops opened up, and if this place was here then, I would have definitely been spending a lot of money here!

I don't understand why someone would go to Starbucks, or Coffee Bean, or even Coffee Planation or Jolta Java (I support the local places but come ON, get some higher quality beans if you want me to come back!) when this place is so much better! It's a perfect place to grab a latte while you're shopping or if you need a little resting spot because your arms are sore from carrying those shopping bags full of new clothes. 

Bonus: They have a discount on baked goods after a certain time (like 3 or 4pm I think?). Great for an afternoon pick-me-up!"}
{"text":"An upscale coffee joint nestled in a quiet plaza beneath luxury apartment buildings near Tempe Town Lake, Press offers quaint coffee luxury, plenty of nice seating, and a laid back yet contemporary spot to study, hangout, or do some reading. It is a little too quiet and off-the-grid for my taste, but if you like the seclusion, you'll like Press.

Their coffee menu is pretty standard, no fancy flavors or combinations. They have a breakfast menu and some novelty food items like Avo Toast and muffins that look good, I was tempted to try the toast especially. Definitely will come back for another spin and maybe indulge in a caprese on avo toast."}
{"text":"Good coffee. Not the best place to hang out in the morning unless you want to smell like bacon all day long."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good coffee. Right in the middle of super upscale shopping. If you're in Scottsdale and need a good cup of coffee, go here."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and delicious breakfast! I got the egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on the multi grain bread and added avocado, they are VERY generous with the amount of avocado they put on it. So good and fresh! I also ordered an iced vanilla latte, the latte was really good but wasn't very sweet so if you like sweet coffee I would ask for more syrup. Perfect little breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"My mom was raving about this coffee place, so we decided to drop in. I ordered an iced vanilla latte like the basic white guy I am. It was so excellent in taste and presentation! I really liked the atmosphere of the coffee shop as well! Extremely modern with a zen vibe!"}
{"text":"Funny story....we were staying at a hotel 5.1 miles away. I know this because google maps told me so. Decided it would be fun to get the cruiser bikes that came with our outrageous \"resort fee\" (because we got 2 hours \"free\" each day) and ride to Press for morning coffee and brekkie.  Got on the bikes, pedaled over to N. Scottsdale Rd and we were on our way! Except.....that....I decided to check our progress after a little while and discovered we had gone the wrong way for a mile and a quarter. Sigh. Turn around, get yelled at by the hubby, kids think it's funny, and off we go. So by the time we got there, we were HUNGRY and THIRSTY! Our 5.1 mile one-way bike ride had become a little more than 7.5 miles.And let me tell you - that cappuccino tasted delicious.

So the next day, we drove. Guess what? Not as good. Still good....just not as good. The coffee was actually lukewarm when we got it. Thinking back, it was that way on the first day also...we were just unusually warm ourselves so didn't much care. Also, there was a bit too much milk for my taste....and I had purposely ordered a triple shot, knowing from the day before that they already put double shots in.  However, to be fair, this is also one of the never-resolved issues I have around wanting more espresso and less milk, but some milk, and foam, but don't want to guide someone through that whole thing. So it's rarely achieved. Except at Temple Coffee in Sacramento...but that's another review. Oh - but the Lemon Poppyseed muffin was the best one I've ever had in my entire life - moist, flavorful and lemony with rind. That was worth the trip right there.

All in all, we'll give it another shot when we're back in town."}
{"text":"3 stars for the tea so what killed the other two stars .. 
The barista seemed busy and in different to her job. Not very engaging or warm (perception mine) never asked if I wanted the beverage here or to go .. pet peeve of mine.. I hate drinking out if paper cups if I don't have to. The tea itself was simple enough to not mess up but then when I asked for creamer - they were out and upon notifying the staff they seemed irritated more than concerned about it. (She was busy I must admit) I'm sure they refilled it but I was already at my chair and never quiet knew when the refilled it or what not. 

The croissant I ordered seems old. No warming it up or even asking it I wanted it warmed up. I thought this was a given. Heck who eats cold rough croissants. Again this could be a one off and I'm sure it's a nice place.

The ambience is pleasant and like it should be. I liked the art work on the wall for sale and like to see coffee shops be constructive with their wall space. Very nice.
 
I hear the coffee is good and I haven't tried it yet but I will be back for it if I'm in the area and based on that I'll update the review. It's always good to see independents give the chain stores a run for their money. And when I do come back I hope to give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge coffee aficionado as I tend to order simple coffees, but I loved my experience here at this trendy little cage in Scottsdale! A friend of mine took me here as she always came to Press to study for her classes and she spoke highly of this place. I ordered a simple vanilla latte which has always been my drink of choice, especially when going to a new place. The flavor was magnificent. I have never scarfed down a coffee so fast! The flavor was not burnt nor too sugary but with all of the caffeine I was desiring. If I am ever driving by, I know where to go. The staff were very friendly and inviting and they have a very generous reward system. My friend had a free reward and the entire purchase was free, so my friend's AND my coffee were free! I am definitely recommending this place to anyone who loves and even just likes coffee as you'll really enjoy their beverages they have to offer."}
{"text":"They make great Americanos, the staff is well versed on coffee and are very friendly. Coffee is expensive not sure if this is a Scottsdale thing? Although it's a mall this place isn't very attractive for lounging."}
{"text":"First, let me say that I love this place. That being said, I offer a warning: this place will suck you into becoming a coffee snob (\"aficionado\" is the nicer word ).
I started coming here in 2012. At the time, all I wanted was a drip coffee, served black, and their drip was delightfully flavorful (not bitter and stale!) After a few visits, one of the baristas noticed that I was always drinking my coffee black, and suggested I try the Chemex coffee. I fell in love with the smooth, rich flavors, and kept coming back to try different varieties. Before long I had purchased a Chemex of my own, driven down to their roastery in Tempe for their weekly coffee tasting and met their talented roaster. I soaked up their wisdom like a sponge. I sampled coffees from across the globe. I learned to make Aeropress and Turkish coffees, bought a Moka Pot in Italy, and have attended Latte Art competitions they've done with Cartel.
I love this place, but beware: you will never see coffee the same again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee places in AZ. Love to come here and work, it's comfortable, good music and brightly lit. The folks working are always great! Also love they have food, kombucha and different snacks/drinks. Only suggestions would be to have a gluten free bread option and a few more outlets would be great!"}
{"text":"Always a consistent place for a delicious cup of coffee! Staff is always friendly! A great place for getting a cup for shopping at the Quarter!"}
{"text":"Press has some of the best coffee that I have had in the Phoenix area, and they have good food, too! The staff makes you feel welcome, and they do a good job of explaining all that they offer. 

I have been to both this location and the one in Tempe. Neither one is too quiet, but enough to get some work done. There is plenty of natural light coming from the huge windows. It is a comfortable place to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Love Press at this location! Went back to Scottsdale, super underimpressed this location makes the the others seem lower scale!"}
{"text":"A good coffee option while shopping within The Scottsdale Quarter. I stopped here during a mid-day in early June where the temps were around 125 degrees, and my energy level slightly depleted. I left Press Coffee Roasters an hour later feeling much more relaxed, and slightly amped up. Here's why. 

First off, the venue has a good quantity of caffeine assortments, yet none better than its iced coffee concoction known as \"The Brew.\" In addition to an H20 mix (out of order on this day) as well as another mix that combined both The Brew and H20, The Brew was some of the best tasting cold coffee drinks that I've had in a long time. Just the right bit of blend that didn't make the coffee exceptionally bitter nor watered down like a decaf. While the AC was most certainly at 73 degrees, The Brew seemed to refreshen my body while also drinking an additional bottle of water. But that's just me. I highly recommend those to purchase bottles of water with whatever you drink whenever temperatures are above 100 degrees. Its just common sense. 

There are a few snacks available, such as Snickerdoodle cookies and others from local vendors, yet they are so-so (a bit too hard & brittle). The interior decorating is modern, if not somewhat bland in a way. The exterior has several chairs and tables, should you want to enjoy your drink there. While shopping in The Scottsdale Quarter, there are plenty of blocks that have water mist raining down on you, and this area around Press Coffee Roasters is no exception. The WiFi at this location is what you would expect for a coffee venue- not too bad to upload/download, yet not too great either. Its just right. 

Kudos to the tenured female manager for recommending The Brew drink!"}
{"text":"Not often do I write a review, but when a place deserves it I write one. This place is where you can chill and work or even enjoy the views with the large windows in front. What keeps me coming back is the staff and the excellent coffee. I recommond checking out this cool urban coffee shop. Keep up the great work guys.

{"text":"Great coffee and the owners are top notch people.  My only issue is the music.  People don't come to coffee shops to listen to heavy metal. They want to conversationalize or work on their laptops.  All in all, great place."}
{"text":"Small unpretentious clean and inviting. Press Coffee cares about the details
and it shows in their approach daily to serve the public. I was in with my wife 
and had a simple coffee brew and it felt like home. A good quality cup of coffee
is really enjoyable, it really brightens your day.

Servers anticipate your visit and very professionally work as a team to please you.
You realize they are having a good time though the guest is the only priority. 

One thing I appreciate as a consumer is consistently and here although there is
different staff on any given day, everyone collaborates quite seriously to insure
you get fresh, hot, delicious coffee, close your eyes when you sip to fully appreciate
your experience.

Lets hear it for the independent coffee shop !"}
{"text":"I love this spot! I come here often and do homework as it is never too busy and their coffee and snacks are great! They are a bit expensive, BUT, there is free parking and there is no time limit which to me is nearly priceless in the area of Tempe. I really enjoy coming here and I think the atmosphere is great and easy to focus in. It is kind of hard to find the first time because the only way you can enter is from the light that leads you into Skywater apartments if you're headed to the airport direction wise. There is adequate parking and always room at tables even when it gets a little busy."}
{"text":"Not only an incredible and friendly staff, but incredible cappuccinos and small desserts to enjoy with it! The chocolate almond biscotti and a nice cappuccino is something I HAVE to recommend anyone. Perfect duo."}
{"text":"This Press Coffee location is tucked away in the Skywater Apartments complex across from Tempe Town Lake -- kind of like a hidden secret that happens to also have tons of parking. I stopped in early on a Sunday afternoon and got a Hibiscus Green Tea. The barista informed me that they do free tea refills all day long, so I came back later around 3:30pm to get a refill and a grilled cheese sandwich. I guess they had closed the kitchen early so the grilled cheese was sadly a no-go but the tea refill was good. I would probably stop in again when in the area."}
{"text":"Yummy coffee with a personal touch. Not like the conveyor belt at Starbucks or Peets. 
Friendly staff and very good, rich coffee."}
{"text":"Such a great shop! I like to call this one a little hidden gem, I don't understand why this place isn't packed all the time! The service is outstanding, all the people I've met are super knowledgeable and they don't make me feel bad about wanting flavor syrups in my coffee! I stop by every time I take my kids to the zoo and will definitely stop by every time I'm in the area. Really an amazing place! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came to this location because it's closer to my house. I've frequented their skywater location but glad to know there's one closer to me. My kids loves the grilled cheese and just tried their capreese toast, super good. This store is a lot bigger then the other locations I've been to. Today was really busy when I went around 10 but the line moved really quick! Really impressive. I will definitely be returning because I love Press. Oh! This location also had Italian sodas that my kids enjoyed, a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"We tried their Holiday Blend drip coffee and both give it 5-stars.  I bought of bags of different whole coffee beans from them and it tasted just as good at home.

The hot chocolate was 2 stars though.  Not real chocolate.  It tasted nasty after the first sip.

The caprese was okay.  The bread was too hard and tough.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Each time I visit Scottsdale Quarter, I discover a new treat to hit the streets. While preparing for an event today, I found myself in need of a caffeine boost and hoped for a coffee shop in the Scottsdale Quarter. Wish and your dreams come true...or apparently that's the case in this situation! Enter Press Coffee. 

Situated off one of the alleys in the Scottsdale Quarter, this is a must-try for the caffeine crazed folks like me. The coffee shop isn't huge, but it's big enough to comfortably seat a couple high top tables, as well some other seating in addition to the outdoor tables surrounding the front. I walked in to be welcomed by two visitors enjoying a game of chess, a woman working on her computer and guests with their dogs out front. It looked like a comfortable setting to do some work or relax. 

The staff greeted me and I decided to go for an iced coffee with a splash of chocolate, sugar free vanilla and non-fat milk. I got a 16 oz (yes it was one of those days) and was pleasantly surprised at the $2 price tag. This is not what I expected at a coffee shop within the Scottsdale Quarter. 

The coffee was delicious! Now, normally, iced coffees pretty much all taste the same. However, the actual coffee in this iced coffee tasted different...in a good way! The iced coffee went down smoothly and almost tasted like a dessert treat. It gave me the energized kick I needed. 

If parking wasn't such a problem at Scottsdale Quarter, I would plan on visiting often, but I'll have to opt for only times when I have the time to find a parking spot and make it a leisurely trip."}
{"text":"The coffee was great. A little bit pricey but they have free refills on the drip cup. The staff is very informative and seem like they enjoy what they do, so I would recommend over Starbucks any day."}
{"text":"They are across the street from the Apple store, so if you are heading to Apple for an appointment, come here and grab a cup before you go.

Best vanilla latte I have had so far.  It did take awhile but I watched the barista make it with lots of love.  He really was focused on my latte.  And when I took my first sip, wow, Starwho?  So glad I came here instead of heading to the nearby competitor like I usually do.

I only hope this guy stays there, and this was not a one time amazing latte."}
{"text":"Some of the best espresso Ive had in a very long time! Was so impressed with the quality, the flavor and the staff, Press is a complete package!

{"text":"Good Coffee, Good Service, Good Prices and Good Atmosphere!

Good Coffee: Tasty libations, aromatic and smooth flavored coffees. Lots of choices and the people working here know about coffee...

Good Service with a smile and good recommendations of things to try. We even got some samples to make informed choices!

Good Prices which can sometimes be a surprise! With fair prices like these you can expect more repeat business frequently as opposed to some places that charge $7 for a coffee that is $2-$4 here. 

Good Atmosphere! Nice clean area to hang out and enjoy your beverages and talk with friends or maybe to yourself if you don't have friends...

All in all this is a new happy place for me... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in the valley! Also the atmosphere is ALWAYS warm and friendly. I would highly recommend this place to have a cup of coffee and relax."}
{"text":"Went when they first opened and I was the only in there and they still messed up my simple order of iced mocha. Felt very sterile and unwelcoming and then to have done it incorrectly in addition, they will not have my business. Too many other coffee houses that I love and will keep my business. Prices are higher so with the total experience, I will not be back."}
{"text":"FIVE for customer service. I cannot get over how amazing the customer service was ;) I asked a lot of questions and received friendly answers. They did give me a sample of the Nitro brew (cold pressed coffee) and I wasn't a fan but I've heard it's popular. I appreciated that they were willing to let me try something before buying it (always a plus in my book). I ordered 2 medium roast brewed coffees - 12 oz for a total of $3 and some change. The coffee had a fruity, light taste and as a coffee snob - in regards to taste, not science - I enjoyed it. I don't live in AZ. Sad story :("}

Im picky about my coffee so I brew my own daily however they do have a wide variety of coffee options to choose from including cold pressed options, frapps, juices, gluten free treats and other baked goods and sandwiches def must try!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best cup of coffee I have ever had!!!

Press is like a winery for coffee. My barista helped me select my Pour over by the strength of the bean, where it comes from and the notes.

After he explained all that I told him to pick.  Needless to say from the temperature, strength, and  flavor it was a coffee experience.

Now the Avacado toast!
B.F.T-Bacon, feta and Cherry tomato avocado toast. I added 2 poached eggs.

The multigrain toast was perfectly grainy, soft in the center and hard on the edges like sourdough. Perfect texture to hold the fresh Avacado on top. Bacon pieces and feta were then added on top of the spread. 

The eggs were perfectly poached and together it was hearty and healthy. I would suggest a little more acid and seasoning on the Avacado, with a little sliver of chili flakes on top, I promise it will deliver. 

Great space for meetings, and office work.

Press is my new love!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this cafe during the morning rush hour. I spent about 10 minutes looking for parking on a Wednesday morning, and another 10 in line. The vanilla latte was extremely bitter and also sickly sweet at the same time. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First timers here! I ordered a 16 oz iced mocha. So delicious! The environment is aesthetically pleasing, and the barista that helped me order was very friendly. The stroopwafels were also very good!"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that a coffee place, that knows how to do coffee right, has such an amazingly angry person managing the store. After ordering 4 shots over ice, she tells me that i wasn't charged enough because I was going to add cream to my drink. The bickering  went back and forth for a good 3 minutes, when while she claimed this was \"store policy.\" The basic argument was she would only do 4 shots over ice in a small paper cup IF I was going to add cream. You could tell  the poor cashier who apparently \"rang up my order incorrectly\" has seen this side of her manager before and apologized for the inconvenience. If it's the owner, well I guess that's how she likes to do business. If it's the manager, the owner should take a good look at the leadership at the store because it's evident that she treats people (customers and staff) like crap. I will not be returning but I'd imagine that would make her quite happy. Such a bummer. If you can stand an arrogant manager, their coffee is quite good."}
{"text":"Came here for a coffee date with a friend, and I was greeted with a refreshingly clean, bright and modern coffee shop.

I ordered a small soy latte with an extra shot (that kinda day) and it was perfect. Not too much foam and not too hot. Along with my latte, I ordered probably the best chocolate croissant I've had since I was in Europe. 

Prices were appropriate, maybe even less expensive than Starbucks. Staff was very nice and cheerful.

Definitely a must drop by when shopping in the quarter :)"}
{"text":"Press Coffee's coffee? Meh. I've tasted better out of the office Keurig. 

And they too have adopted the practice of only selling extra shots at a minimum of two shots. So, if you only want one extra shot they charge you for two and throw the other one away. Eh? They don't care if it's down your gullet or down their drain; they got you to pay for it."}
{"text":"I've been past this place so many times, I think I've even been in it before but today was the first time I ordered something from there! 
My friend wanted to stop here for coffee, but I decided to get a tea since I don't drink coffee. My friend had high expectations for the coffee, but she said unfortunately the more she sipped it, the less she enjoyed it. The guy working at the cashier was super friendly and helpful, told me about the teas. I decided to go for a jasmine black iced tea and it was delicious! Felt bad for my friend who had a bad coffee experience since the tea I had was awesome. The interior is cute too, not a whole lot of space, but it's a pretty good size. Fits in with the aura of Scottsdale Quarter. I'd come back here for some tea, and also I was glad to see they have almond milk so I could get a chai tea latte with almond milk if I'd like!The cupcakes and muffins looks fabulous as well, very tempting."}
{"text":"Ordered my first beverage at Press Coffee this morning....a 2 shot decaf americano.  I believe this is one way you can tell if your coffee house is the real deal, they also have great decaf and know how to pull their shots.  
Well, overly disappointed.  Very flat shots (no crema whatsoever), lackluster aroma.....I can make it WAY better at home without a doubt.  Not what I expected from the good reviews."}
{"text":"Delicious! All reasonable prices and high quality beverages. The service was excellent too. It was great :)"}
{"text":"I love the coffee and the food it's truly amazing. 5 stars to both. However, recently they started giving plastic silverware. I can hardly eat my food with it, not sure what the reason is but it ruins the overall experience! Hence taking out a star!"}
{"text":"Normally I don't order a cappuccino on a first date (i.e. First time at a new coffee shop) because most places in the valley just can't execute. However this place had such a gorgeous espresso machine that I thought I'd give it a shot. 

Ordered my cappuccino with whole milk and did a fantastic job. Espresso was a nice robust, dark flavor without being bitter. Milk was micro-foamed and had a nice glossy finish. 

They paid a lot of attention to detail but were also pretty quick so we weren't waiting too long."}
{"text":"So to start this off we heard that this place was one of the best through a snap chat commercial. When we got here we were not greeted, so we looked at the menu dazed and confused since we had no idea what was good here or what flavors they had. The lady that attended us did not make any suggestions as to what was good here and we continuously repeated ourselves because she was very distracted. As customers, we did not feel appreciated and valued. we certainly did not like the vibe this place has nor the service we received. We are definitely not coming back to this place, and we will not recommend it to our friends and people who like to be treated with the best customer service."}
{"text":"Definitely decent coffee and espresso. The two things that bum me out are no gluten-free baked goods, and the espresso lacks real flavor. It's good, but not \"wow good\". 

The consistency of the lattes and cappuccinos also varied depending on which barista you got."}
{"text":"Pretty average shop, to be honest. Coffee wasn't spectacular, especially since they were just awarded best roaster in Phoenix again. Must be the lack of competition. Service was average, even for being busy.

The artisan nature of the coffee will draw a big crowd in the shopping complex- but as a third-wave institution, I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Very solid red eye. Coffee plus espresso plus soy milk. The espresso gives the coffee that lovely crema on top and the soy milk rounds out and softens the flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on the sidewalk sipping my coffee and chatting. 

I think I'll have to stop here whenever I come to the Quarter to shop."}
{"text":"I love this place. Cartel is right down the street but I find myself coming here on my lunch breaks. I've had the cold brew, a burrito and the nitro cold brew on tap. All of it has been great. This place can get really busy but it's usually pretty quiet."}
{"text":"This place is usually pretty empty but I can't figure out why.  The location is a little tricky the first time you go, but easy enough to find.  There is plenty of natural light inside so it's nice to hang out.  Oh, and the coffee is great.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place to do my homework and this was it! I had the hummus and flat bread dish and the blueberry green tea and both were delicious. The store has its doors opened up to let natural sunshine in. There is also outdoor seating. There's no bathroom inside, but there is one in the quarter so make sure you make a pit stop before you get comfortable. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"A smooth tasting latte. That's all I could ask for. Happy that there is a location closer to me than Scottsdale quarter!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place and even better that it's in walking distance from my home and office. I especially go in for their protein bowl. The staff is great and very professional. Sometimes I go there with a friend who has a dog and they are dog friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe when you walk in, very cool decor. Coffee was everything I expected....very very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Best place to get great coffee. Need to try the nitro brew!"}
{"text":"Brandon is awesome! He gave me great customer service. The tea is delicious. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Espresso made with love.  Barista makes every drink to a high standard. She knows the temp your foam should be and takes her time making sure your drink is perfect.  She steamed my milk but as i watched she pitched it because it was too hot. Any other place would have served it but they want to make sure it's done right.

My cortado was perfect. Foam had small bubbles, espresso with nutty buttery flavor with a mid drink almost oak taste. It was lovely. Thank you. This is definitely a place to return.  Just be patient as you know your drink will be perfect."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for coffee.  I wish it were more accessible when I'm in a hurry but a fantastic place for an afternoon break.  Love,  just love the cold brew iced coffee, black!  Simply wonderful"}
{"text":"I love Press! My parents live right down the street and are regulars, and I love to walk down when I'm in town. The coffee and iced tea are splendid and the environment is perfect for working on the computer or reading -- plenty of small tables and a nice patio. I've had the breakfast burrito and avocado toast, and enjoyed both."}
{"text":"On our continuing mission to hit all of the good little coffee shops in the valley, we ended up here. I had an iced chai latte which was yummy but not as spicy as I usually like. This is a cute little shop tucked into the mall. Service was fast and friendly even with a steady flow of people in and out, and they definitely know their coffee."}
{"text":"This was my first time there and the entire experience was great. Very very fancy looking. You were allowed to get some tasty coffee, beers/wines, or some healthier snacks. Most importantly the employees were fantastic. Had two lovely ladies that informed me and my nephews on all of the different types of coffees, how everything is made, where the other locations are, they were great. They made our experience perfect. Hope that you read this and you give this place a try, you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Good local coffee shop.  Authentic taste for cappuccino and great atmosphere.  WiFi works great also."}
{"text":"It's about time I visited Press Coffee! Spacious & well-decorated interior, natural sunlight for good conversation and/or study vibes, friendly service, and great coffee! I've tried the black coffee and the Kombucha - both very good. Free refills on coffee! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't really drink coffee, but when I do I go to Press Coffee. Their coffee is super rich and tasty!!"}
{"text":"Love that they are local. Love that the employees are friendly. For this, a star each. But the purpose of a coffee house is... great (or at least good) coffee. And sadly I abhor the nasty, sour and bitter espresso that is their roast. But don't take my word for it: experience the bitter coffee face yourself (if you dare); at least you're supporting a good local cause!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience here although there was a mistake on my order and I had to stand in that darn line twice. But the espresso was delicious and the Flat White was very good. The peanut butter cookie was so good we bought two more. The line ebbs and flows and moves relatively quickly so don't panic."}
{"text":"Coffee here is good. Service is okay. We came in and ordered coffee and two breakfast burritos. They gave us one. We told one of the staff that were missing one burrito and he said he'd take care of it. Thirty minutes later we're still waiting here with no burrito. It's been grueling watching the other people out here get their burritos. Even as I'm typing out the word burrito rn my mouth is salivating. It sucks cuz the burritos here are so good but this..... this is torture. Please bring me my long lost burrito. Please oh god please."}
{"text":"Supporting the community! We appreciate our iced tea!! Thanks for coming out to the corner and dropping it off to all the teaching rallying for our schools."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly service and delicious coffee. Each drink is crafted like a work of art. Great place to come and study if you're lucky enough to get a table. No restrooms in shop though. The matcha latte was delightful."}
{"text":"What a great unique coffee shop located in the scottsdale quarter. It's a cute small rustic coffee shop with a fun delicious twist on coffee. This place is busy but totally worth it. Customer service was excellent and they even have bags of coffee that would be great to purchase and gift to a loved one. 

I was so mesmerized just watching them brew coffee filtered through a glass jar when I was in line.  Doesn't get any more fresh or smooth then that! They also had cold brew on tap! Yep that's right! So they can bottle it up for you to take home. Yes please!!! (:

My friend and I got a cappuccino that was served with the beautiful foam art. The coffee had a unique  flavor that I loved. It was just strong enough but flavorful. I added a little sugar for sweetness and I couldn't put it down! They had a few breakfast items and pastries too so we split the caprese avocado toast that was delicious! Paired perfect with our coffee as it was light but super flavorful with all the toppings.

Great place to stop in with a friend or get a quick coffee to go while you shop. Looking forward to coming back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is one my favorite coffee shops and since finding this place, I seldom go to starbucks anymore. The staff is super nice, they even bring you the drink to your table and it feels more like a family run friendly place than an assembly line setup of the typical starbucks, and what I really like too is their super fast and free internet.

The owner Steve is also a super nice guy and always is on top of things. If you're looking for cool place to have awesome coffee, this is the place to visit."}
{"text":"Solid coffee shop. Prices were average, but they had a lot of options. I gave it the tried and true test of ordering a hot black coffee. The verdict was......very tasty. Not burned, not too bitter, just a smooth cup of joe. My only complaint about this place would be the wait. It took a little longer then normal, but overall it was a great place."}
{"text":"Look I'm a coffee lover,,, I don't want to check on Cartel but I was at Scottsdale Qtr and I wanted a coffee fast so I walked to Press coffee. 

The line was out the door so I decided that I'll make a stop.  The coffee wasn't bad.... Blah customer service but it was my first time there so I'll cut them so slack. 

All in all the coffee wasn't bad now would I trade it for Cartel no way but it's a good second place!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a pick-me-up when you're out shopping. It's great that they aren't limited to just coffee as well - they have 4 or so flavors of smoothies available. Prices are reasonable and a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"This could easily be a 5 star, but today I had the urge to get a ice tea instead of there staple coffee drinks. Yes I know it doesn't make much sense but I am not an afternoon coffee person and always and I mean always a ice tea all day everyday expert! The iced tea that I sipped on  was the black passion fruit unsweet beverage. Impressed with the drink and the establishment is nestled in the middle of the Skywater at Town Lake Apartments. So I guarantee on my next visit to try out the cold brew coffee, until then..."}
{"text":"Always have fresh good coffee, lox and begal is awesome, and their avacado toast is scrumptious!!! 

If the food and coffee wasn't enough their staff is always friendly, helpful, and engaging. 

I love hanging put here reading and drinking a cup of joe."}
{"text":"Very nice place for coffee if you are looking for a modern but hip spot. The staff was very friendly and though we didn't try any food the avocado toast looked amazing. It was completely full when we went in, but the line went very quickly. We just got cold brew, which was pretty good and I liked that when we asked for almond milk they gave us the whole carton to pour as much as we would like into our coffee. The stand with lids and sugar is a little bit inconveniently placed as we were bumping into people sitting down as we were trying to close our cups. Definitely want to come back and try the food!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, and cozy place.  It smells fanastic in there.  They employees are friendly, fast, and accuracy in the orders.  I got the iced green tea, yum!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a nice coffee shop with great coffee and pleasant environment around tempe for a long time. So far, this is my favorite place in Tempe! This is a very quiet place that is located on the first floor of an apartment complex. The coffee there is in high quality! And the staffs there are super friendly. This is always my first choice for study and work."}
{"text":"Great coffee, love that you give same day refills in drip coffees. Had an egg, sausage and swiss breakfast sandwich with pesto on multigrain and would recommend it. A little pricey for a breakfast sandwich with no side but we'd biked there and so was worth the experience. I'll be back for coffee for sure!"}
{"text":"Great muffins and good coffee is always smooth (cafe latte is my fav). Love riding my bike over here to chill out for a second and enjoy the laid back environment."}
{"text":"Couldn't figure out what makes this place special. I tried asking questions about their coffees and roaster, but get like I was dragging the information out of them. I ended up leaving because it was annoying."}
{"text":"We really like this coffee shop they go out of there way to greet you.  There coffee is very good they, also serve single origin coffee, which is cool.  Nice to have a shop in the area.  Hoping they locate to Queen Creek.  Only pitfall I feel is the seats are not that comfortable.  I'm sure there is a reason behind that though."}
{"text":"This place has very good coffee and is excellent, however they don't put lids on their coffee and it always spills everywhere. I will never come here again"}
{"text":"I'd love to be there for one of their tasting events.

Ordered a cold brew and it was straight from the tap, next to their nitro. The coffee was pretty smooth. Cafe had plenty of seating and areas to work from. The barista was friendly and offered us samples of the nitro vs reg cold brew. I wish we had one of these in SF!"}
{"text":"This coffee roaster is located in Scottsdale Quarter. Next to the Menchie's frozen yogurt. 

Very modern decoration inside the cafe. I like their mugs. Would have probably bought one if the coffee was good enough...

I came to this Coffee shop prior to my trip to iPic (the movie theatre nearby). It wasn't very busy on a Friday afternoon. I ordered a cappuccino. The barista was pretty friendly. 

The latte art and the cappuccino were alright. I think the cappuccino I got had too much milk in it, and I didn't really find the espresso taste... May be mine was just a exception based on the previous reviews..."}
{"text":"The kind of place that tells you how to order your drink. Barista refused (or wasn't trained) to make a proper cortadito unless in a paper cup and insisted that I order a weak iced 16oz latte, when this is quite far from what I wanted. Rather expensive in relation to FANTASTIC coffee houses like Lux or Cartel in Arizona or Blue Bottle, Four Barrel, Sight Glass etc in Northern California. Unfortunately, they use low quality non-organic, high sugar content Kirkland/Costco brand milk and soy products -- even Starbucks uses better quality organic products. They appear to ruin any chance at having a decent tasting drink by choosing cheap ingredients. Also as other reviewers have noted the baristas/employees are on the pretentious side and the vibe is rather sterile. 

Update 11/2: Went back to try again since there are no other decent coffee shops for miles in the area I'm visiting except chains. I ordered a macchiato. The expresso is still too acidic, but customer service was better. I still would recommend avoiding and going to Maverick (has Ritual from SF) or Sip Coffee or sticking to the chain coffee shops."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee roasters. Their quality is top-notch. Solid food menu with lots of options to try and compliments the coffee well. Try their Nitro Cold Brew!"}
{"text":"It's alright if you're not here for the service and coffee. They have a nice set up and location, free wifi, that's about it. The cons first and foremost, their blends are mediocre. I was pretty disappointed because my bf just moved into the apts this Press location is connected to so I was looking forward to this Press being a regular for us but it sadly didn't make the cut. Service was initially nice but I noticed I was served quite differently than all other guests. Idk what the cream is, didn't taste like breve to me even though I asked and was answered yes it was."}
{"text":"This location is very modern, yet comfortable.  They have very nice chairs on the patio that are shaded for people to enjoy their coffee outside.  My hubby thinks Press has some of the best cold brew in the valley.   I ordered a medium latte and was told I could get 2 more shots for only .50 more.  Yes please!  Their lattes are delicious and service at this location is always with a smile."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the extreme creaminess of the latte I ordered here.  The barista made a nice little design in the foam and filled the cup to the very top.  They have 6 or more choices for slow roasted coffee but 2 options if you just want a quick cup.  My hubby got a quick cup of the Rwandan coffee they had that day and really enjoyed it.  It seems like a great place to sit and read or work and there are multiple tables outside in the shade to lounge and enjoy your cuppa joe."}
{"text":"The parking situation is very easy at this location.  The store is always packed, but the service has always been fast and attentive.  I am a huge fan of an extra 2 shots in my latte for only $.50.  Press has amazing lattes as well as some of the best tasting cold brew in the valley.  It's definitely my favorite coffee shop in the Valley."}
{"text":"This place makes exceptional coffee!

Love their chemex method and wide selection of darker roasts that really pack a punch to start your day. 

It's much too pricey as an everyday option, and pretty tough to find parking that's close by. Since they make their coffees individually, you also have to expect a bit of a wait before your coffee's ready. So stop by here before a long day of shopping, but don't come here if you're trying to be on time for work.

Or you should come here. The weather's way too nice for you to be stuck indoors!"}
{"text":"Very nice coffee shop in the high end Scottsdale Kierland Commons. 

Pour overs are market price and rotating, lattes are handcrafted with art, and food items look and taste great. 

Just for a tip for future visits, the pour overs are very large--probably 16oz. Most places do 8-12oz pour overs, and the price reflected it (two types of Ethiopia for $12 + tax. 

The price is the only reason I docked a star. Everything else was high class. My wife and I make sure to stop by every time we are shopping in the area. 

Also worth noting--free refills on iced teas. So you can walk around and go back for a refill later in the day. The barista generously informed us of that."}
{"text":"I love the fresh roasted flavor of Press's drip coffee. It has such a smooth taste. And I'm pretty partial to their Chai Tea. I've tried their breakfast burrito, avocado toast & poached egg, and a few of the pastries. All of which did not disappoint. The staff are always so friendly and helpful. I love having Press Coffee as my neighborhood coffee stop!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect. Coffee is amazing, breakfast second to none and the staff provides exceptional service."}
{"text":"some of the best latte and the best ice coffee i've had in the country!  really not much different in price than cbtl or starbucks, yet can't even compare the quality.  

if you want to be able to park right outside the cafe, try going to their citynorth location.  parking can be a pain at scottsdale quarters unless you don't mind parking in their garage and then spend 10min walking over."}
{"text":"Hands down the best iced mocha I have ever had!  I love this place and have been to the other locations but would love to see one go in in North Central Phoenix (Central and Camelback area).  I have tried most of there coffee and latte style drinks but really prefer the iced mocha the best.  Food is pretty good too and has changed my perception of breakfast! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, plenty of seating, free wifi and a sweet & savory food menu. A surprising find at the Scottsdale
Quarter and a welcome one indeed. Whether you need a pick me up in between shopping or need a place to get some work done- Press Coffee is a solid choice for sure."}
{"text":"What's not to like? Excellent coffee with plenty of options for everyone. Super sweet baristas and great customer service. A menu that isn't just sweets, although I indulged in a zucchini muffin (it was delicious). Ample seating indoors and out on the patio. Savory menu includes breakfast from burritos to various toasts, eggs and lunch too! And the wifi is free. Seriously- what's not to like!"}
{"text":"My new fave coffee spot. Great customer service and the dirty chi is top notch! The atmosphere is very calm and . Love it!!!"}
{"text":"This location is tucked into the Scottsdale Quarter and it's a great stop off to pick up a coffee and a snack to refuel and get back to shopping.  We popped in here while just enjoying a walk around the area and the server was very nice and our order was up quickly.

The place is very nicely decorated and it's fun to look around and read the signs and enjoy the art on the walls.  They have some seats inside and few outside if you are looking to sit and enjoy the coffee while you are on site.

Overall: A
We'll be back I'm sure!"}
{"text":"I was at the Scottsdale Quarter to visit the Genius Bar at the Apple Store and was a little early for my appointment.  Of course they won't take you early so I had to kill some time.  I walked across the street to this Coffee Shop to grab a cup of Joe.

I ordered a Med Coffee, $2.

The Coffee was pretty good, next time I'll try the Cupcakes.

Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee shop in the Scottsdale Quarter. The staff was very friendly and gave some good suggestions. Coffee and food were delicious and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Press Coffee Roasters is a fantastic coffee shop in Scottsdale Quarter that I met up with a friend at  yesterday. The place was packed at 2:00PM, we were lucky to find a table outside. 

I had a white mocha, excellent balance of coffee and sweetness from the white chocolate. My friend has a cappuccino and said it was perfect.  

Beautiful modern interior. Probably about ten tables inside and a few tables outside. Outside is great for people watching. 

Friendly, helpful staff!

I highly recommend checking Press Coffee out! Be patient though, they only make one drink at a time to ensure that its done right! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Parking is difficult here sometimes, but the coffee is worth it. Lattes are great. Friendly and chilll vibe. Indoor and and outdoor seating. Freshly roasted bags of beans are available."}
{"text":"Very modern unique vibe in a gorgeous area of Tempe. The outdoor seating is great. Only three stars because the latte was good, not great just average. But the breakfast sandwich was incredibly small... For $14 not worth it. In sum, overpriced coffee shop."}
{"text":"They made me the best Breve Latte I have had in a good long while.... and the barista made it beautiful! I had to take a picture.

This is a great place to stop into in you are strolling Scottsdale Quarter. I like to go here before I see a movie at the near-by iPic theater."}
{"text":"Great vibe, great coffee, and clean! Coffee is spot on, add avocado toast with poached eggs = a perfect Saturday morning breakfast.
My daughter loved her hot chocolate, croissant was ok!
Love that they do fresh juice, will try that next time!"}
{"text":"Press Coffee Roasters is a MUST for me whenever i'm near The Scottsdale Quarter.  The coffee and espresso is A-MAZING!!!  i've never gotten anything fancy, so i can't vouch for any of that stuff, but i'm hard to please when it comes to americanos.  my only beef is that they charge you extra for larger sizes of americanos even though you're only getting more water.  I understand that a larger cup costs more, but we're talking about espresso and water here, not a latte.  Not to mention that if i get a larger size and they're NOT putting more espresso in, i have to pay for the extra water AND the espresso or it just tastes too watered down.  It just doesn't make sense to me."}
{"text":"Get the Machiatto! (just $2)!!

Heaven in a cup! I crave it often.

The coffee is strong and full bodied so you expect a bitter taste at the end, but instead your mouth is filled with the aroma of the coffee and a roasted flavor. .....kind of like a cigar, but coffee. It's really hard to explain. You just have to try it to see what I mean.

We met the guy that owns it and he told us the espresso machine is 2nd to none! It's expensive and has all these temperature and pressure features that make the coffee much much better.

Also, they roast their own beans here. It gives the coffee a unique flavor that no commercialized Starbucks can compare to."}
{"text":"Stopped in one Saturday afternoon for an iced Toddy.  The coffee was well-balanced and nutty--no hint of bitterness in this cup!  I spotted a nice selection of full leaf teas and a handful of pastries, but nothing screamed \"EAT ME!\"

The staff were friendly enough but kept the interaction to a minimum. It's an ideal spot to stop and relax; that is, if you don't mind battling the traffic of Scottsdale Quarter.  If you're looking for a late night java jolt, head to the Starbucks across the way in Kierland."}
{"text":"Press coffee has really good cold brew and muffins. The muffin I had was really fresh. The cold brew was really strong and not nitrogen based. I thought it was really good. It wasn't too expensive either. Parking is free here. Unlike some places around Arizona State, this place doesn't charge for parking. It's underneath the sky water apartment complex. It's a great studying place. Quiet music and not too crowded. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"This place needs more stars!  Amazing coffee/espresso.  Love the remodel. If there had to be a negative it would only be that they need a bigger space.  Favorite coffee shop in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Have been hooked since my first sip.  I've visited Press at least 20 times since they've been open and absolutely dig it!  The staff is super courteous and knowledgeable and goes the extra mile to remember my name and drink (although I switch it up all the time)!  Haven't yet tried their food but the cupcakes they source are ridiculously good.  Keep up the great work!

Edit:  Wish they were open a half hour earlier so I could get my fix in the morning!"}
{"text":"Great coffee! *Iced Vanilla Latte* Great people. Fast wifi. Why not!"}
{"text":"I sort of love this place. Really cute atmosphere and great cappuccinos and avo toast. My only gripe is onions on their avo toast. I had it for breakfast and had to deal with oniony coffee breath all morning. 

But when the weather is nice and their doors are open I'd rather sit in here than a Starbucks."}
{"text":"We came for a quick bf before heading out for a hike. This place was busy and had a great casual, hipster vibe. They offer simple breakfasts of poached eggs, toast, avocado, etc and they also have various pastries and healthy bars.
I had OJ, scrambled eggs(I had to request this) and avocado. Hubby had 2 poached eggs, toast and avocado while my son had 3 poached eggs, toast, avocado and turkey. Hubby had a cappuccino and my son had an iced chai latte. Both liked the coffee beverages but the food was just ok.
We bought a large bottled water and 3 protein bars to go as well.
The total cost of all items was $45. There is no washroom in the cafe but there is one a short walk away within the shopping complex opposite True Food Kitchen."}
{"text":"THIS IS WHERE YOU GO FOR REAL GOOD COFFEE. 
The people here are passionate about making sure their customers are satisfied with the absolute best.
The kombucha on tap (and bottled), cold brew on tap and nitro cold brew on tap is refreshing and one of the very best selections.
The way they take their time on the espresso drinks will leave you wanting more. The pricing is the best I've seen; especially for the gold you get! I've noticed an immense desire to provide the right cup of coffee at Press. In regards to their brew bar, they have Kalita and Chemex; they happily describe each as well as what would best apply to the customer when you're checking out. They love selling their product (because it's the best) but even more so, they love those who have a desire to know more.
At Press, I've noticed a welcoming community loving environment in regards to coffee. 
It's the kind of coffee place that deserves to be snobby, but isn't and loves sharing what they love!
The food is also truly spectacular (no exaggeration). The avocado toast is to die for, and they have various options for avocado toast! 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 
(If you're not choosing Press Coffee, you're basically wrong.)"}
{"text":"The Caprese Avocado Toast will change your life!
Super fresh and delicious, poached eggs were spot on and the tomatoes were perfectly ripe."}
{"text":"Delicious cappuccino.  Good strength (not watery) espresso.  Mine was done up with whole milk in the 5.5 oz \"for here\" ceramic mug (vs to go paper cup).  Soft, clean and relaxed industrial style.  Open atmosphere.  Seating indoors and out.  Friendly baristas, reasonably priced.  Busy enough, yet easily found seating.  I'll definitely try to visit this nice little shop again."}
{"text":"Press is the Hoity Toity coffee shop in Scottsdale
If your looking to people watch try going around 8:30
If your looking to pickup bring your dog
Plenty of talent to choose from.
Oh yea the coffee Baristas actually care nice slow pours
on the lattes 
Downside to Press the line
Upside people watching at its best."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. Hard to find parking at peak times, but the staff is super friendly and the coffee and tea is incredible."}
{"text":"Was relaxed, friendly, Delish! Took a 9 miles bike ride to get here and well worth it!!"}
{"text":"This is in an apartment complex, a short walk from Tempe Beach Park.  It was pretty quiet and scenic; a good spot to read at. The iced mocha is my drink of choice and it is good (though Cartel was better in my opinion).  I'd recommend this if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Exquisite lattes and great customer service. I have become a regular in the last eight weeks following a friend's recommendation. Beautiful location."}
{"text":"If you want a change from the Starbucks and Coffee Bean's, this is the place. Great coffee and love their breakfast burritos! I live very close, so always hitting them up on the weekends to sit outside and enjoy their coffee. Would recommend to anyone that wants something a little different than the two chains I listed above. I do still go to them quite a bit, but Press breaks up that routine."}
{"text":"Best coffee in north scottsdale. I love their ice latte which is not too strong. I think they put too much milk  on a latte. I would want to have more coffee flavor than taste of milk. It is very crowded everytime we come here. You will never find emptyseats. I usually do take-outs."}
{"text":"This review is based solely off of their drinks, as I haven't tried any of their pastries or food. I'll update my review when I finally get over to try their food! 

I've had coffee from there on two different occasions and their coffee is just mediocre. I had a caramel latte that tasted super watered down and didn't have much flavor at all. The next time I went, I just got a black coffee, which was good, but it's super hard to mess up black coffee. I have heard from coworkers that they have good chai teas, but I haven't tried them yet. 

My favorite thing to get here is their tea. They always have numerous flavored unsweetened teas that are awesome! The white peach one is delicious! Last time we went, they told us that we could come back for free refills. I'm not sure if that's always a thing, but pretty cool to take advantage of if so!"}
{"text":"Very cute shop in a great location. Not ideal for studying or working, but perfect for coffee dates or popping in for a quick drink while shopping. Employees are friendly and the drinks are great!"}
{"text":"Really good lattes here, nice environment. Service is fast and friendly. The place is very clean and comfy. Great for relaxing day."}
{"text":"So happy we found this place... the Nitro Cold Brew ROCKS! (Hard to find real cold brew coffee in Az!) The staff is funky and very friendly and the service was incredibly fast. Great location with amazing people watching from the sidewalk patio. We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a meeting and had a delicious Chemex Ethiopian pour over. Staff was very kind and informative and helped me decide. It was great. Price was a little high but I had the best and it was worth it. Atmosphere is modern and chill. I'll be back. Tip: keep your cup and return all day for drip."}
{"text":"Great place! Good change from Starbucks of Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, I must say. 

Plus, how can you beat a foam-milk design of hearts or an angel on your favorite, hot beverage?! Such a nice touch.


Only con for me would be absence of restrooms, but I have noticed that this is a common theme in Scottsdale Quarter establishments. 

Love the fact that they have oversized, leather chairs w/smaller tables as well as the high bistro tables w/high stools."}
{"text":"I'm a fan for location (walk from home), nibbles and the always friendly staff. I've only ordered the regular drip coffee when I've visited and I'm not a fan. Next time I should order a cap or other specialty drink and see how it stacks up. Love supporting local business though, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great environment to study but the tables are a bit small. The coffee is pretty decent but I never got to try their food. This is a great place to put on my studying/lounging list."}
{"text":"A must stop every time I'm near by! I get the Americanos or cappuccino. Bold coffee with a rich taste!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and tasty kambucha. The barista I met really knows his stuff and the environment and staff are welcoming. The prices are very low considering the quality of what you get here."}
{"text":"Loved the pour over coffee! Be prepared to wait 5-7 min, but well worth it. The quality of the coffee reminds me of the great shops in Seattle-big fan. Only negative was the subpar breakfast sandwiches, but not a huge deal."}
{"text":"So glad to have a Press Coffee closer to home! I've frequented the Scottsdale Quarter and Tempe locations but I really like this spot (don't miss the \"tasting wheel\"!). Best cup of coffee in the valley - locally roasted and their baristas know/care enough to tell you why it's so good. Will be back often!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best local coffee shop.  The staff is knowledgeable, helpful and FRIENDLY.  Maybe my favorite caramel iced coffee.  Also, I think they recently remodeled and revamped.  Loving the new vibe!"}
{"text":"Reviews are better late then never, so let's talk about my visit to Press Coffee on Sunday morning! So my girl and fellow Yelp Elite Brittany C, decided to try out a new coffee hang out! LOVE IT!

The atmosphere was modern, upbeat, staff was welcoming, and can't forget the beautiful art on the wall. The aroma in there was great too, if you love the smell of coffee in the morning you will definitely appreciate Press coffee. 

Their menu had a variety of options, they really cater to the tea and coffee drinks. Not to mention it's a great place for brunch! We had avocado toast with mozzarella and tomatoes on top, and it was the just right amount to share!! AND finally to the coffee that we had, cappuccinos! I love my espresso just as much as the next person, but here was just the right amount of flavor! I've only tasted coffee like this over seas! For my taste buds this place was unforgettable! 

When I'm in the area I WILL be back! Not to mention if you go to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, they have a location in the terminal 4 lower B's side. I recommend checking them out and stopping in for a taste caffeinated treat!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and friendly service!  Second visit and I still like it.  Restrooms and tables clean"}
{"text":"I stopped by for an almond cappuccino and to get some work done and immediately fell in love. The atmosphere is elegant and modern, the breakfast menu is everything I love (the avocado toast is amazing!), and I love their pour over bar options (they have a delicious Sumatra Mandheling). There's plenty of room to setup my laptop and work for a bit, which was the main reason I came here in the first place. I'll definitely be back. Loved it."}
{"text":"Hey this place is small, nice, has friendly staff, and is hipster enough to feel unique, and not hipster enough so you don't feel like a tool for going.

I got the frape, thought it was european style frape, where they shake it up.Nope its their play on the starbucks frappacino. It is way better than the corporate version, Less sugar and actually tastes...good ... yeah i said it.

I'd go again if i was in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to get some coffee here. Nothing knock your socks off awesome. Worth trying if you are in the area though."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a local coffee shop to satisfy my coffee addiction and I think I have found my new place. Enter Press Coffee Roasters, a small coffee shop located in the heart of the Scottsdale Quarter. Sure, parking is hard to find (especially when you just want to get in, grab a coffee, and be on your way) but the drinks are worth it. I have been here several times now, trying hot and iced lattes, iced toddies, their breakfast burrito, and even a blueberry muffin. Mmm... all of them have been delicious! 

I like that there are several different sizes of drinks to choose from - 8oz being their smallest and 32oz being their largest depending on hot or iced. I can't decide on a favorite, since my mood for hot or iced depends on season/time of day, but their iced toddy is really good. (Plus, they have simple syrup so I can make it as sweet as I need it!) 

The employees and baristas have always been extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I love watching them craft a drink, especially the lattes. Seeing the thick, creamy foam and then delicate foam art - yeah, it's awesome. To top it off, the actual roast of the beans is fantastic. I am a huge coffee snob and dislike burnt/bitter coffee. Luckily, none of that happens here. 

If you are in the neighborhood for a good coffee drink, definitely come check Press Coffee Roasters out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The interior is modern with a bit of a cold feeling to it. 
This is decidedly not not a \"homey\" chill out place, and the music was horrific. As I sat down they were playing Justin Bieber (I'm not lying) and they followed it up with some like-sounding pop pap. Good god, I hope this isn't what our future neighbors are going to be like. 

That said, my caramel latte was actually pretty good.

I guess if you hate all of those \"crazy\" \"artsy\" places in the neighborhood this is your place."}
{"text":"This place has the best Chai Latte that I have ever had.  Plus, their coffee is really great as well.  The staff are very helpful, knowledgable and very polite.  The coffee can take some time to prepare, but it is worth it.  I agree with the other reviews that there could be some warmer decor in the place, but it isn't a big deal.  I just wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The people are great and always so sweet! The service is nice and you're really treated as if you were top priority!
Also ask for Daniel (K) if he's available cause his service is best! (He's also my brother)"}
{"text":"Wow cool setting and seating choices in and out with outdoor shopping mall all around. Good drink made here and was excellent. I will sure return."}
{"text":"Here on trip for business, and I love my coffee. Found this place on yelp. Very very good. Enjoyed it immensely. These guys know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Quiet charming little coffee house with the best avacado toast and eggs! Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Such a great new coffee shop in Chandler.  Actually one of the best around. Service is great and decor is urban hip and clean.  Great place to sit back and enjoy."}
{"text":"If I could give Press Coffee six stars, I would. They are consistently good, and roast and serve amazing coffee. They make a true classic cappuccino, pour with excellent latte art, and have experienced barista's on staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was walking to Lola and stopped here instead. I'm a huge fan of Lola as well as Giant (both nearby) and I've got to say that Press is going to give both a run for their money. All have equally high quality espresso. Seating is much better here at Press than at Lola. I had an egg, potato, bacon, cheddar, chipotle burrito. It was delicious. All ingredients cooked well and the tortilla was crisped on a press/grill.

Four stars only because the pastry selection is on the generic side. But I'd come back for the food and coffee any time!"}
{"text":"I'm really bummed that this place is so far away from my house and that it's located in such a douchebag kind of location.  I don't want to see people dressed in clothes that cost more than my car while enjoying a good cup of coffee, and goddamn they serve good coffee.  I've had so much bad coffee in the valley in my first two months here, at places that call themselves coffee shops with \"baristas\" who dump foam onto my cappuccino as if they were a lunchlady unloading a particularly glutinous scoop of mashed potatoes onto my tray.  No thanks.

This place is like heaven.  A Chemex pour-over with my favorite Ethiopian coffee?  Oh yes.  I usually have to cover up Phoenix coffee with a thirty second pour of sugar and a half-gallon of cream, but not here.  I drank it black and relished every smooth drop.  The crazy-ass 18-hour iced coffee on the wall?  Pretentious and awesome.  Love it.

Okay, back to the location.  Why, oh why did you put your shop here?  Were there too many shops in cool locations and you decided that a-holes in Lamborghinis needed better coffee than me?  (I'm not exaggerating about a-holes in Lamborghinis, since one of them couldn't stop looking at my wife's boobs the entire time we ate at True Food).  

I want you to reconsider your poor choice of locations, with my full forgiveness, and open a shop in my garage.  I won't even charge you rent, just a Chemex pour-over every morning.  At the very least open a shop somewhere in central Phoenix.  I'll work for free.

By the way, the two girls who were working today were awesome.  Five stars for them!!!

Four stars because I'm pissed you aren't closer."}
{"text":"If your favorite coffee drink is a sugared up 32oz double Dutch Freeze or a Venti sugar free 2 pump caramel macchiato with extra whip, you probably won't be a good fit for Press.

On the contrary, if you enjoy coffee that has been rare beans purchased through ethical sourcing or directly from farmers, roasted with the utmost care, a dialed in shot of espresso checked hourly, and classy baristas trained in the art of coffee, this is your Mecca."}
{"text":"First time here and loved it!! Not only is the coffee delicious but the service is friendly and the environment is clean, comfortable and nicely decorated!! Our barista was skilled and took pride in delivering a perfect latte! Even his artwork was perfect! We love Early Edition and bought two bags for home. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited here yesterday morning with a friend from out of town. We asked the guy at the counter a couple of coffee related questions but he seemed bored of us and not very enthused to talk coffee. So we ordered two 12oz lattes and a medium ice water. We waited for our drinks and when our lattes were done, we waited another minute for the water. When that didn't come up, I figured they forgot that I ordered it, so I asked the barista. She just looked at me without answering, then grabbed a small paper Dixie cup, filled it with water and put it on the counter without a word and walked away. Seriously? It's not like she was too busy to get a proper cup of ice water and take the time to fill it. There was no one else in line or waiting for drinks, so I was really confused to be handed a tiny paper cup of water in such a seemingly classy and upscale establishment, especially when I look around the room and see several people with water in a proper cup with a lid and a straw. Hopefully I'm not too thirsty otherwise this two gulp paper cup of water isn't going to suffice. Maybe they give free paper cup refills? Okay, we take a seat outside but we weren't aware of how wobbly the table was, so when we sat down our coffees spilled all over the place. Soooo my friend went in and grabbed napkins and we cleaned it up and moved to another table with what was left of our coffees. We definitely were not going to say anything about it since we had just been treated like such an inconvience. We were enjoying the beautiful weather and cool atmosphere when after about 20 mins, the same barista came outside and wiped down some tables, giving us grumpy looks when she walked by. Not sure what we did to upset her but it was super strange and definitely made for an even more terrible experience on top of the paper cup debacle. (Which btw, we saw several customers come and then leave with nice adult-sized cups of water. So maybe there's a code word we don't know about..) We left and went to a different coffee shop where the staff don't give dirty looks or treat you like you're interrupting or bothering them. Will not be returning to Press. Bummer, I really wanted to like it here. I've posted a pic of the pretty coffee with the paper cup just for kicks. Two stars only because of the cool outdoor seating and decent coffee."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, sometimes I go to coffee shops because of the coffee. But most of the time, it's because of the aesthetics. That's what wins me over. Since I've been on a coffee craze recently, I go to coffee shops only to compare coffee beans and to see if I can recreate it at home. One other thing I can only get at coffee shops? Latte art. Unfortunately, it seems like it's going to take me years to master that one. On the other hand, it does give me an excuse to check out different cute coffee shops. :)

Parking & Location: This is in a shopping plaza, which as plenty of parking and incredibly accessible from the entrance. It's literally ahead of you when you enter the Ocotillo downtown shops.

Atmosphere: Super sleek, white and modern themed. Love the huge windows and branded coffee/t-shirts/etc. The natural sunlight comes in nicely and is perfect for taking pictures!  Since we came right after Christmas day, they still had their Christmas decorations up! Simple greenery garlands and such, but still incredibly cute.

Service: Super prompt, patient, and helpful. We ordered at the counter, got seats, and picked up our coffees when our names were called. Didn't take longer than 5 minutes to get our drinks. Everything was in a to-go manner (muffin in bag, coffees in paper cups) without asking. We stayed to chat anyways, and perhaps if they asked us about that, we could've gotten our things in mugs and plates to save the disposables.

Food: I ordered a latte and shared a pumpkin spice muffin with my sister. The latte is must've been from a light roast coffee, which isn't particularly my preference. Still okay, though! The baristas make sure there's a cute little heart of latte art on top. The pumpkin spice muffin is huge and enough to satiate 2 people as a snack. It's covered with a light glaze drizzled on top and super moist on the inside. 

Overall Feels: Hoping to come back the next time I'm in AZ and try the other goods they have to offer! I may ask further about the different brew they may have so that I can enjoy my lattes as much as the aesthetics."}
{"text":"Good food an beverage. Friendly but a little out there when I ask for something, I got something else entirely. They were so friendly tho I gave them fours stars anyway. Their food was very good for a coffee joint and nice outdoor seating while we were at the center."}
{"text":"Great place! Had a cappuccino which was great and the caprese avocado toast. It was wonderful- refreshing and filling (for a light breakfast). I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I like the cafe.
It's all about the coffee. They have various beans available to smell. Descriptions of the flavor profile. They offer two varieties of pour over. Chemex and another which allows a fuller bodied cup of coffee.

I went with the peaberry and full bodied pour over variety - it was pretty good coffee. Definitely not run of the mill. They sell beans they roast and the price they told me was about 19 bucks for their whole beans. That price isn't too bad considering the price of good coffee online.

Will come back to try another variety if I'm in the area. It's a bit pricey for a small black cup of coffee but hey it's Scottsdale lol."}
{"text":"I am picky about my coffee, I like just a simple cold brew with or an americano with almond milk! This is most definitely my favorite place to go go in Tempe by far!"}
{"text":"So glad that this Press just opened up in Tempe! I've been to the Scottsdale one a few times and have always had a great experience. The location is kind of odd, except I kind of loved that about it! It wasn't too busy or hard to get to! Just a lil' random. But seriously, what a perfect spot to stop in, get some work done & grab a delicious coffee. This morning I came in and had no idea what to get. Luckily the two gentlemen working here were very patient and helpful. From the criteria I gave them they had me try a iced dirty chai with almond milk! 10/10 recommend. Made me feel like they were really listening when I listed off my wants and needs. Thank you, Press. Can't wait to come back again and again!"}
{"text":"I go to small coffee shops everywhere I travel, which is frequent and far-reaching, and Press is one of the best I've ever had. Great thing is, I only live 30 minutes away. Every time I'm in the area I stop here. Friendly service, amazing coffee, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Excellent local coffee shop in a beautiful location. I ordered the wife a vanilla late which she said was the best that she has ever had! I had the house coffee which was good. I really want to come back for their personal brewed cups one day. I also liked the decor and staff was very nice. It was also a nice day out, first day of fall!, and we had a blast sitting at a table and chairs right outside and people watching. When I'm in the area I think I'll pass on Starbucks and head for this local shop! And that's hard for me to say because I love Starbucks!!! I have a. Feeling after I try their personal coffees I'll be updating this to a 5 star."}
{"text":"I came in when it first opened to buy a bag of whole beans for home use. The girl who helped me was very nice however I was quite disappointed that they don't offer even a free small coffee when you buy a bag of beans which most other coffee shops do. Also the beans were a lot pricier than other ones I have bought and the flavor was not great."}
{"text":"Amazing! They know how to make real lattes here. Other places will steam your milk so hot that it ruins the espresso. You can taste the difference right away."}
{"text":"Good food, good coffee, good atmosphere, friendly service.   Good design which we appreciate.  So far I see no evidence of eco friendly packaging or cups however which I would love to see more of on the mainland since it's almost unheard of to not use it in Hawaii.  Anyway, we love gourmet breakfast/lunch/ coffee places so this one hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Coffee: 4/5

Ambiance: trendy, upscale

Press Coffee in Scottsdale Quarter is one of the better coffee spots in North Scottsdale, but it doesn't come cheap. I've never seen the place not packed, so if you're going there to work remotely for the day, I suggest you go early. It's an intimate coffee shop, so I wouldn't go if you have personal space issues.

Coffee: AWESOME. They have cold brew and NITRO brew on tap (my fave), so that's where they get my vote. They also have specialty coffees from around the world, so it's definitely a unique place to grab a cup. Drip coffee starts at $2, Nitro & Cold Brew starts at $3 (if you haven't tried the nitro before, proceed with caution if you're sensitive to caffeine).  Their double espresso is pretty fine, too ($2.5). Other items like Cappuccino's and Americano'r range from $2.75-$4.75 and have lemonade and Kombucha (on tap, yes! $5). They have Pour-overs (mkt price) with an assortment of world class coffee from around the world (Rwanda, Ethiopia, Colombia, Guatemala). Definitely try all of those.

Nomz: They have a few breakfast items like the breakfast and lunch items that also range from $3-$10, with additional protein add-ons if you're feelin' it.

Overall experience: A bit busy, but great hip vibe and great coffee. Everytime I go, it's an easy experience with the nitro brew, so it's a breeze when I go in there. If you get one of their pour overs, then you'll have a longer wait for sure (totally worth it). Scottsdale needs more unique coffee shops like Press, that's for sure.

{"text":"Coffee: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: Casual, trendy

Coffee: You can't go wrong with the coffee here. My go-to is the cold brew ($3.50) but they have everything from drip coffee to Americanos. For an upscale specialty coffee spot, the prices are normal. The entire menu ranges from $2-$4.25 for 8oz drinks, and nothing past $4.75 for the 32oz caffeine hits. My second vote on the menu is the Cortado ($3.50) if you're craving something warm and are an espresso lover like myself. A shot of espresso mixed with some milk, and usually comes out with a fun swirl design (and who doesn't love that?!)

This location is my favorite so far, it has a great space (small patio as well, if it's not too hot out) and perfect for getting a few hours of work done (pretty quiet in there) or a relaxing place to grab coffee with friends. 

Fun fact: Press has a pretty cool story. Basically a college dream that turned into a thriving brand with locations all over Phoenix. Excited to try all of them! So far, each one is unique in its own. 

Tip: They have weekly \"Cupping\" classes (1 hour) and tastings on Saturdays ($20 online, \"Coffee 101\"). They're big on education, and offer 2-hour home barista classes at their training facility (one hour focus on espresso training, one hour focus on milk - who knew there was an art to foam!). Will have to check that out sometime. 

Overall experience: great! It's super casual, and everyone that works there is always super friendly and has a smile on their face."}
{"text":"Come here.  This is where you come for a casual cup of elevated or stylized coffee.  I don't mean that in an insulting way.  This, my friends, is as close to a coffee singles club you can get.  Beautiful people hanging out and competent and interested coffee staff making works of art.  What I mean is that they actually care about you liking your coffee.  From bean to espresso grind, this place has it figured out.  There might be a line, and seating is ample, but when they are slammed you are sitting in the sauna outside. Another best part, you can pop in while you are doing your shopping in this very cool outdoor upscale shopping center."}
{"text":"Fresh roasted coffee beans available. I grind my own each morning so this place was a move find to try new types of beans. Looks like a nice place to just chill and enjoy your beverage but I have only purchased coffee beans. So far I liked all three kinds I purchased and tried at home. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"The Valley has some great coffee shops, but I like coming to this location even though it isn't that close to where I live and work. The baristas are always friendly, and the coffee is great (both the daily drip coffee and the iced Nitro). I really like this Ocotillo location because the shopping center reminds me of Santa Barbara and it's a nice place to sit outside."}
{"text":"I'd like to set the record straight on this review - perhaps putting my review to bed until I return to try it again!

A colleague suggested that I go to this place with fantastic coffee - he told me where it was and even told me what to get. Seeing that I was on vacation/work - I took my family of coffee lovers to this place and put it through a test.

First of all - there were four different types of drinks ordered - mine was the one the colleague suggested - something about Ethiopian and Blueberry. I wasn't sure of what it was called, but that was description enough for the staff behind the counter.

Amazed at the process they went through to get this cup of coffee for me - I couldn't believe the cost - I would expect MUCH higher prices. AND knowing that they roast their own beans and measure things precisely - I was really interested in the taste. 

Now I will warn you again - I do NOT consider myself to be an avid coffee lover or expert on what coffee made in this manner should taste like. Look - I have a Krueg - coffee maker so I can have variety - and I like SWEET - so I use lots of creamer. I say things like - I have coffee only to warm up my creamer because I don't THINK coffee drinkers really do that, but who am I to know?

Everyone was sitting sipping their coffee when I finally got mine. I don't say finally because it was too long of a wait - I say it because I was last to place my order and they were already sipping theirs - let's not read more into this. When I got mine I instantly tasted it and was reminded by the girl behind the counter that the coffee should sit a minute until it gets to the right temperature. I'm not sure how long that was, but I waited, paid and then took my coffee over to the table my family was sitting at.

I tasted my coffee - I REALLY did NOT like it at ALL. I took it back to the counter and asked if they had like creamer and sugar - I was given both and was looked at like I was some strange alien - ok I get it - coffee drinkers must drink black coffee.

I then took my coffee back to our table and sipped it and still didn't like it at all. I let my family taste it and they said they didn't like it. I said - I can't stand it and they all started to laugh. I said - what's so funny - they told me they were afraid to tell me how bad they thought their drinks were too because I was SO excited to take them here.

So - I will state this again. The people behind the counter were friendly, knowledgeable and quick. The price was very reasonable considering the process and all that they do. The place was clean and we had a table to sit at. However, these four people simply did not enjoy the coffee. 

So there you have it - more detail then I've ever written before and I hope this clears this review up! I will give another update in September when I dare to return and hopefully meet Steve the owner!"}
{"text":"Love the Chemex coffee, and the fresh pastries--the chocolate croissants are delicious. I'm taking away a star because they charge for cups of ice, which is a bit disappointing with their prices."}
{"text":"Okay, this place was so condescending and rude. They offer no help or time to order. Like you have to know what you're getting when you walk in. Second, their drinks were okay..... it was kinda bland and just bad.... 

In addition my poor friend who was dying of bladder problems has a scarred bladder now cause they got no bathroom????! Like come on.... what a funky coffee shop... If I wanted kidney stones, this is the coffee shop to go too."}
{"text":"Nice little local coffee shop in Chandler. A decent place to come and get some work done.  My breakfast was tasty.  The service was also a good perk.  The staff this morning was really kind and friendly."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!! yum yum yum. egg sandwiches & chai tea are always delicious and I've never had bad service. my friends and I love to come here! it's such a great environment for chit chatting or reading . I would suggest it to anyone in the area :)"}
{"text":"Located in the Skywater complex at Town Lake, this little shop is tucked away on the far right side on the 1st floor. There isn't much signage that directs you here from the main road, but they do have stainless steel lettering on their white wall storefront, letters that gleam and are very precisely cut. A plus is that there are several places to park nearby. We came straight from the airport in search of new coffee places with great quality, and we were in luck here. Apparently there's also a Press Coffee location in Scottsdale, but if you're a visitor like me, you didn't know that, and we weren't headed in that direction. 

I loved everything indoors! They have a lovely blue wall in the back with their logo painted in bold letters. There are metal, square tables with an assortment of black bucket chairs and these absolutely adorable quilted chairs! They have different swatches of fabric all over them. I'd totally want one of those in my house. To top it all off, the AC is spot on. They also have a large wooden table that would be perfect for group activities. 

I'm getting carried away by their shop that has been so well put together! Let me not forget the good coffee. I got an iced latte, which they only serve in a 16 oz size. They offered a blend of whole and nonfat milk, so I could get \"2%\" milk. I loved the taste of the espresso but it got kind of lost in all that milk. Next time I'll ask for a double shot. Cav got their cold brew, which wasn't that impressive. There weren't any special flavor notes, but it also didn't have any nasty bitterness. Also they serve it on tap, which is cool. I'd pass on the iced coffee next time though. 

We tried a sample of the apple cinnamon coffee cake. It was moist, delicious, and flavorful. I'd be down to purchase a pastry next time. They also offer heartier breakfast items like burritos! I appreciate that, especially because it's not necessarily standard coffee shop fare. 

Then of course they also sell some Chemex and pour over products, as well as their own beans! That way you can have lots of Press Coffee-loving all day, every day!"}
{"text":"Located in the Scottsdale Quarter, Press Coffee fulfills the need for a high quality caffeinated drink if you are shopping in this area. In addition to coffee drinks they have lemonade and tea. I was hungry and also wanted an iced coffee so I stopped by and ordered an iced mocha with almond milk and a breakfast burrito. The breakfast burritos allow you to choose your meat, cheese or no cheese, and sauce (Garlic tomato, chipotle, or basil). I went with a turkey breakfast burrito with egg, cheese, and chipotle sauce. 

The mocha came out first and the coffee was smooth and went well with the almond milk. The pumps of chocolate syrup added to the richness of the latte. For next time though, I will probably get it with no syrup and add a small amount of sugar or honey since the coffee is high quality and I don't need any extra flavor to hide it. 

Since this place is primarily a coffee shop, I wasn't really expecting much with the burrito. It was a strange concoction to me, but since this isn't Los Favoritos hey what do you expect. The turkey was sliced deli meat with slightly tough eggs, and the whole burrito was grilled in a panini press. Panini breakfast burrito? There's a first time for everything!

Service at the counter was decent. They were quick to take my order and my total for the 16 oz iced mocha with almond milk and burrito was a little less than $15. Overall I'll go back for the coffee but I'll skip the savory foods and get something to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have known about this little coffee shop had I not done a search on Yelp. Located at the end of the Skywater Apartment building, the ambiance is serene and contemporary with dark blue tones and wood accents. The menu has a succinct selection of coffee drinks, with chai tea as well, and various types of coffee roasts to choose from at the counter. Milk alternatives here are soy (Extra $.50) and almond milk (Extra $1).

Since it was a sunny warm day I went with an almond milk latte and tried some vanilla frappe. The latte was refreshing with smooth, rich flavored espresso with a chocolatey undertone. It was such a nice blend of flavors I only needed a small amount of honey to sweeten the drink. The frappe was also very refreshing, with more of a blended smoothie feel and a good balance of vanilla and coffee flavors.

Service at the counter was friendly. The location is a bit out of the ways from where I usually shop or dine, but if I'm in the area I'd definitely get more drinks from here."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend the chai latte over ice! It was busy but they work fast. Definitely worth it and will be back. Much better than the Starbucks down the street. They have great-looking sandwiches that I'll try next time!"}
{"text":"Their beans are awesome. Yup, that's how I'm starting this review because I think it's the most important thing to communicate. Get their brewed coffee, and you're golden, because this is a legit Third Wave house that does it right. Yes, you'll have to wait a bit, but it's worth it for rich, properly roasted brew. The interior is modern and welcoming, and there's always seating. And I've always found the service to be gloriously unsnotty for a high end coffee place in a high end area of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing atmoshere, great service, surprisingly low prices (at least for my americano which was 2.43 for 4 shots in a 16 oz)! Highly recommend if you love coffee!"}
{"text":"I have gone to the Press coffee at Kierland a few times and love the taste and richness of the coffee. It is amazingly smooth and expertly roasted. 

I also went to a Press coffee tasting where they taught us all about the different kinds of coffee and how to notice differences in the flavors. It was such a fun way to spend Saturday morning! It was a small group of people in the back of Sorso. They prepare a power point and are so passionate about coffee. Not like the fake coffee drinkers who just drink Starbucks with tons of milk and flavors. This is real coffee love and appreciation. 

This new location is much bigger and brighter than the one at Kierland with a great vibe. There is free covered parking which is awesome because parking downtown can be a pain. The baristas are so nice and good at what they do. Highly recommend Press as one of the best coffee roasters in Arizona."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee! Everyone  here has a great attitude. Free refills on coffee !! Thank you for a wonderful coffee experience. Simple menu and great prices."}
{"text":"Okay, I have to admit, I think I've gone five stars early as i am so excited to see this place finally open. It is right along my morning walk to Tempe Town Lake and back and they open at 6:30 am, which is about the time I finish my walk so convenience and and opening early in the morning win the Press Coffee folks an extra star.

The shop is clean and a well designed and pleasant interior with strong AC as the shop draws upon the general AC of the larger complex in which it is situated. I liked my almond late though they may want to ask if the drink is for here and then provided it in a cup (to show off those fancy barista skills with a cool design in the foam). I also ordered a muffin and it would be a good idea if they provided a plate with the muffin (if they have them). I figure they are in the early stages of getting their routine down and those are only some general suggestions for improvement. Other than that, pleasant staff, great location, and if you live in the building you can order a coffee and/or a pastry and they deliver it to your door so nice benefit to living in the Sky Harbor apartments. I plan to be a regular early morning customer of this establishment so looking forward to their continued success. Oh, if they could also do some savory pastries, along with the sweet ones, that would be great! :-)"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday at 7pm interested in seeing what this coffee shop was like, what coffee they offered, and what brew methods they used. As I entered I didn't get a sense that the baristas are very passionate about their job which is making coffee and learning about it as I have seen at many other coffee shops I have been to.As I started to look at the menu for what coffee was available for pour over brew method I noticed no label on any of the coffees which the type of roast it was which made my decision hard as I didn't know which one was medium roast. I don't understand why they can't just have the common details all coffee shops provide regarding there coffees offered. After ordering the barista brewed my coffee in a Kalita Wave pour over brewer. As the barista brewed my coffee I thought he knows what he is doing since he works at a coffee shop, but boy I was wrong. They coffee was super bitter making it unpleasant to drink. To top it off my order was finished before the customers who had been there for a while before me. Seriously you should look around the coffee shop in order to know if the customers are enjoying there coffee experience."}
{"text":"Love their almond chai lattes. And good nitro. They have nice seating inside and outside, but you can also find good shady seating anywhere within this shopping center. Parking at Kierland is free."}
{"text":"Best espresso drinks in Phoenix and very very good coffee (free refills on the coffee too). Great staff. This location does tend to be quite busy though."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on my break. I took my coworkers with me and they all liked it. I ordered the chai tea latte. It was good but a bit too milky. I like it a bit more spiced up. Nonetheless, it was still delicious. I def recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great stop by when in the Scottsdale quarter.  I love coffee no secret there.  And I don't mean specialty coffee drinks I mean just simple black coffee with great roasted beans where the flavor speaks for itself.  This place has it all. They do have your fancier coffee drinks but don't shy away from the classic pour over. It's good morning in a cup!! 

Great service, friendly staff, with charming decor.  Stop by for a quick cup before shopping you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Super busy! Super welcoming! Pricey for coffee.... but so worth it ! Everything is delish and  the staff are friendly and helpful when choosing a drink! I'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"\"Risky Business meets hipster coffeehouse, with muffins.\"

Press is easily the one of the best ideas in the private Palo Alto that is Scottsdale Quarter and Kierland Commons. It's small enough to feel vaguely like you're in Manhattan, with outside seating to remind you, in February, that you're not.

The staff is wall-to-wall incredible. They are all charming. They understand biscotti like nobody's business. If you need to fight for your right to avocado toast, they have four or five kinds.

The coffee will generally put hair on your chest and possibly your feet. If you like to live dangerously, there's a way to get same-day free refills by returning with your takeaway cup."}
{"text":"A total hidden GEM! Located in a luxury apartment complex, on the south side of Tempe Town Lake. This place without a doubt can one up a certain coffee shop off of Mill Ave.

I ordered one of their specialty espresso with almond milk. The flavor was nutty with a deep chocolatey note. Not at all acidic and at the perfect temperature. The makings of a great cup! 

The vibe is relaxing, not at all snobby. The staff was super friendly and know their regulars. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try during a family visit. Coffee was very acidic, thought it may be the Costa Rican roast which I had to wait 10 min for an individual cup to be prepared, watched my coffee sit for good 5 min before 1 of the people working grabbed it. But my brother's regular house drip coffee also was acidic. Pricey, acidic, hipster, North Scottsdale, a nasty combination."}
{"text":"Who doesn't enjoy a nice cup of Joe?  Press Coffee is one my my favorites when I want to enjoy some good coffee.  You can't beat this location either.  If you're walking around Scottsdale Quarter it's easy to walk right in and get yourself a nice cup of Joe.  Staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is warming.  They have enough tables for you to sit around on your laptop too if you feel like getting some work done.  If you're not into coffee they also make an excellent cup of hot chocolate!"}
{"text":"Very aesthetically pleasing. The barista was friendly, atmosphere very chill and a perfect little coffee spot. Lots of cool merch to buy, and you can come by for a cupping or wine tasting (I've heard) as well. Will be back next time I visit the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"eat. pray. lit. 

great coffee spot. coffee's hot like coffee ought... to be

Aficionado's Avocado Toast, Machiatto... ooo-wee

vibes be chillin, power fillin up like Krillin...in DBZ

I advise to best recognize before you wreck ya lives... Indubitably 

eat. pray. lit."}
{"text":"I love this place. The quality of the drinks, the service, and overall vibe is fantastic. Wish it was on my route but I don't mind the detour."}
{"text":"I'm a creature of habit .. even if I try to order something new on the menu .. my mouth does not cooperate and I always have the same thing.. at Press Coffee it's the avocado toast and one egg .. my taste buds know what's good here.

The cold brew is excellent as is the cafe misto with almond milk .. hot or cold they have something to fit your coffee needs.. 

Plenty of indoor seating for a quick meeting or to catch up on work .. when you walk in you're greeted with the pleasant smell of coffee .. not sugar or pumpkin spice (insert eye roll here).."}
{"text":"First rate on so many levels beginning first with a phone call we made there yesterday. The am manager, Kaylee(?), answered as I peppered with questions about the Press Cold Brew concentrate.  She could not have been more accommodating.

Came into the Store late in the day to see Daniel, the pm Manager. I have a long history in the Specialty Coffee space and we had a great connect.  Press Staffers are on their game about coffee and tea and Daniel was superlative on several levels.

We discussed Press' cold brew concentrate as well as their green teas of which I have a great palate for as my background is in the commercial \"flavor\" space.

In the end, I left as a huge fan of Press and will have my team begin to come here over the other guys.

It's all about the people and Press raises the ante here to provide a world class Scottsdale Quarter experience..."}
{"text":"Just stopped into this unassuming location just off of ASU's campus.  It is in an apartment building as the commercial storefront.  This had me a bit skeptical, but it was convenient from my hotel and I stopped in.  Wow.  There are 2 espressos than you can choose from, one south america and one african.  I went with the african (ethiopia).   This was one of the better ethiopian's I've had.  excellent fruit forward coffee.  I then had a pour over from Kenya and it is damn smooth.  Very good shop and very unassuming.  Definitely a place you'll want to check out."}
{"text":"Average coffee joint that is a nice alternative to corporate coffee. While all the drinks I've tried have been great, I'm still a bit bitter (no pun intended) this place doesn't serve blended drinks...which is why I give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm! The coffee from Press is the best in the valley in my humble opinion. The taste and depth of the roasted beans always comes through in their cappuccinos. I love this place and I'm so glad there's now one located on my way to work. Thank you for your wonderful brew!!!!"}
{"text":"In my quest for really good coffee shops, I look for 5 things and each get a star if they're up to par. 1. Fresh coffee, 2. breakfast, 3. unique atmosphere, 4. comfort, 5. ambient music. Press has it all..."}
{"text":"You, yes YOU! Judge coffee places by the coffee they brew. The better the coffee makes for better enjoyment.

But me, yes ME! Doesn't drink coffee. I'm all about hot cocoa. Press may make all you hipster coffee drinkers happy, but for me it's their delicious (not too sweet) hot chocolate.

Dine in for maximum enjoyment."}
{"text":"Cool space but understaffed/poor service. 

Went on a Saturday morning for coffee/breakfast before an appointment 40 minutes later. Stood in line for 5 minutes before anyone came to the register to take orders, all the while the line of customers was growing. Instead, 2 employees slowly made coffee drinks and loitered wiping counters and tidying. Then when I went to order, I was informed 30 minutes wait. Really? For an egg sandwich? I was told \"it's because we're busy\".  I want to support the business, but plenty other coffee shops have great food/drink and timely service."}
{"text":"Michael took our order this morning while we waited for our flight to board. The Grand Canyon burrito was delicious and the coffee was good but something other than the food REALLY stood out...the service! Michael was so friendly and energized this morning and really seemed to enjoy what he was doing. (Could it be the coffee??) The friendly customer service he and his coworker gave us will bring us back for coffee and a bite to eat next time we fly out of PHX!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some coffee, gotta stop at Press Coffee. Awesome vibe, hip and their selection of presses & teas are awesome. Great place to sit, open up my laptop and get some work done. People watching is also fun at this spot here at the Quarter.

Staff is friendly and they take their time making you a great cup of joe."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and we were looking for a good coffee and breakfast place. This place is perfect!!  Great coffee. The avocado toast is to die for!  Super friendly staff!!  Gonna be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Press Coffee is a great coffee house with great coffee. Be aware though they will try to up sell their coffee every so often. For example if you ask for a iced toddy with light or no ice they will either still give you Ice or will charge you for the next size larger. This is unethical. If you order a 16oz. Then no matter the amount of ice in the cup one should still only pay for a 16oz. I didn't know there was an additional charge for lack of ice displacement."}
{"text":"I love this place!! It is always very clean and the coffee is always really tasty! I always visit when I'm at Scottsdale Quarter. There's usually a table to sit at which is very nice if you want to sit and read or study. I also enjoy bringing my friends to get a latte together and we can sit down and chit chat. I definitely will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"BEST.COFFE.EVER. if you want a chill vibe and some good coffee, come here! You will not regret it! SUPER family friendly and they make you feel super welcome. I had no idea what to order so I went with their recommendation  and won't go back!"}
{"text":"A good change from the regular old Starbucks. The place seems very simple from the decor to the coffee cups (which I like). The staff was friendly both times I visited during my stay in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Always super friendly! Locally owned. Bomb cold brew. Offers periodic classes on coffee knowledge. Keep on keepin on, press."}
{"text":"I am from the Northwest and love my coffee. Press is the first coffee shop I have found in the Scottsdale area that makes me feel like I am back in the NW where everyone considers coffee making an art."}
{"text":"Great mid-town coffee shop.   Easy walk.  Dog friendly.  Food is fresh.  Simple menu."}
{"text":"So yummy! I go to sleep at night already looking forward to picking up my coffee from Press in the morning. I love the cold brew, but sometimes get an americano to change it up. The staff is always friendly and chatty, which makes the environment feel welcoming. I also love that along with the regular sugar and cream you can put in your coffee yourself, they also have liquid agave nectar and simple syrup. I have stopped by in the afternoon as well to try their iced teas, and they did not disappoint! I especially loved the cucumber green tea, but it seems like they switch their flavors every day.

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Press coffee is a good 2nd choice when you are in Arizona Happy employees friendly atmosphere.
It is not a big coffee shop but it's in an outdoor mall so get your coffee and sit anywhere.
I usually have a latte or a cap good to the last drop."}
{"text":"I go here every Sunday for fresh brew iced coffee. I'm by no means a coffee snob but I love the coffee here."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Have been here several times since there are no other coffee options at the Quarter.  Last time it was an 8 oz. soy latte, which was almost $5.  Crazy - WAY overpriced and the chains are just as good.  The interior is incredibly plain and uninviting.  Not warm and inviting like a coffee shop should be.  Service is just ok - and I've been here when they are not busy.  Most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"First things first: the smell of coffee in this place was awesome and fresh not burnt! The coffee shop was very clean and the staff was very friendly.  
The must have just got a new food menu but on an empty stomach and I usually eat more on the healthy side and I like the idea of freshly prepared not cooked somewhere else and then delivered and reheated like other coffee shops. my first taste of their coffee was delicious and that was just their hot coffee. so I tried a couple other drinks (i have a huge coffee problem) Vanilla Latte was on point  and then I had to try the NITRO cold brew! 

I found out they do all their own roasting (lost art for most coffee houses anymore) and they also make and keg their own cold brew and Nitro! alright sounds like a winner.

Now back to the new food menu.  I would call it more small bites but well worth it.  I work in arcadia but I think I have found a new breakfast spot nothing like an egg mcmuffin but real food fresh avocado on top of multigrain toast with bacon on top of that! not too much food but just enough but after enjoying my latte i wanted to try more, not because of being hungry but the gentleman next to me had two poached eggs with sausage and avocado........(Yeah chicken sausage)

Now I was hooked. had to try that too.  AMAZING!  I will be back multiple times per week just for those items alone because lets be real I can't make that at home nor will it look or taste that amazing.  

Coffee is hands down quality and done with a true passion, the girl that made my latte did a little art on top of my latte looked like a heart or tulip not sure but I had not seen such are for just a simple latte from any other coffee spot I had ever been.  If you haven't tried PRESS,  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Just redid their decor! Love the wood on the walls. Great spot, great coffee...and FREE REFILLS. Friendly staff makes it a no-brainer."}
{"text":"By far my favorite coffee place in the Valley!!! If you are looking for a good cup of coffee without the fluff, Press is the place for you! Press uses locally-roasted coffee beans from their own roastery. I live nearby and when I have time, I always try and go to Press for my morning latte instead of a chain. Their chai lattes are also phenomenal, mostly due to the fact that they use real chai, rather than just syrup. They also sell their own coffee and offer subscription services!
Parking can be a little bit of a hassle, as you usually have to park in the Scottsdale Quarter garage, a bit inconvenient if you are trying to do a quick coffee run. 
The staff is always pleasant and will happily remake your drink if there are any mistakes.
As for the storefront itself, the SQ location is subpar. The shop is on the small side and has no bathrooms (closest one's are a a minute or two's walk away). It's a decent place to get work done, but there are occasionally loud groups of women meeting after morning yoga and the chairs are sturdy and plastic, but not super comfortable.

Overall a great place!"}
{"text":"I've visited this location a couple times and it's been great! They have a pretty large selection of roasts from different countries which is refreshing, and they are constantly updating and switching up what they have. The baristas are kind and helpful--I do not get a pretentious vibe at all! Lol. I have only had good experiences here, just ahvet found a drink/food that has blown me away (reason for four stars), but i'm looking forward to my further experiences!"}
{"text":"Coffee is delicious, bakery goods are fresh and tasty, & the staff is friendly & welcoming  .. Overall cheery atmosphere and I'm so happy to have Press in our community!"}
{"text":"Just walked in today and got a Nitro Coffee float. Price was around $3, which was less than I expected. Basically a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream in a glass with their delicious nitro coffee. I added a few pumps of simple syrup to sweeten it up a little more (shame on me :-P)"}
{"text":"Best roaster in Phoenix imo, AND they didn't get the memo that barristas are suppose to be rude, dead-eyed millennials! In other words, great coffee, and even better people. Breakfast burritos are great too."}
{"text":"Great! I'm very picky about my coffee and generally only like black. I love the cold brews here; no bad aftertaste and a great flavor in both. I also liked the flavored coffees surprisingly and thought they werent too sugary."}
{"text":"To be fair this is clearly not a shop for coffee enthusiasts, it tends to cater to people who want something slightly better than Starbucks but only slightly. 

I, on the other hand, am a snob (not proud of it, but I've come to view coffee the same as I do wine, so snob I am). When I visit a coffee shop that claims to roast their own beans I'm expecting to talk to people who know their roasts and give tasting notes so that I can really pick the best bean for my tastes. I've never counted \"it's really smooth\" as notes. 

Once I received my pour over it was burnt. They use an automatic system to pour the water that doesn't actually brew all of the grounds. I'm not sure, but the bean may have started well, but the end product reminded me too much of folgers. Adding cream didn't help either... Won't be here again. Sorry, gave it a shot, but Starbucks is cheaper."}
{"text":"Very nice coffee shop. Everyone is super nice. Coffee is great. I got a quad soymilk mocha, cortado and avocado and egg toast. All delicious and came out promptly. Great place to work on computer when there is a table available. Looks like everyone enjoys chatting with friends and working here. Music in background is at a good volume as to not be distracting. Pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Pleasant place to meet up with a friend and enjoy coffee. There is ample parking and a nice view of the Tempe Center for the Arts. The baristas were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee shop. Met here to do some business earlier today and it was perfect - just quiet enough to have a good conversation and close proximity to the parking garage - getting in and out was a breeze."}
{"text":"Stopped by after having a delicious lunch at Rock Lobster. Based on the rave reviews my expectations were up there.

Maybe I'm too much of a Dark Roast Starbucks fan, but this is not good coffee in my opinion.
They do not offer a dark roast, nor espresso for americanos. Interesting take on being a coffee roaster."}
{"text":"First experience yesterday was perfect! Great food and great coffee. Friendly and educational service. Great atmosphere. We are out on the patio and the weather was perfect! We will be back frequently! I had the cortado. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this morning, and really enjoyed the coffee and pastries. Would have loved to try some of their breakfast menu items, but was advised there was a 30 minute wait for food because the kitchen was so backed up. Appeared to be short staffed, but the staff was still helpful and friendly. Maybe it's time to hire some extra help?"}
{"text":"Best coffee I've had in weeks...and that includes anything I found in Nashville where I stayed for a week. Very impressed with their multiple methods of preparation as well as their expertly suggested roasts."}
{"text":"It was a cool cafe and we enjoyed playing Corn Hole outside.  I had a latte and avocado toast with poached eggs on the side.  Everything was good, but I wasn't amazed by the breakfast. Service was great though and I liked the indoor/outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I went today for the second time. I love how friendly the employees are! I also love that they carry rice milk! Anywhere else the dairy free options are typically soy.  Must try is the blended chai with rice milk. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for coffee...I drive past 3 coffee shops  to come here..Everybody is friendly here....This coffee is by far better than Starbucks..Not even close..The biscotti's here are awesome...Keep up the great work guys..Michael"}
{"text":"This coffee shop recently opened up. Very nice inside... In my opinion, it's way better than Starbucks."}
{"text":"Today's my first visit but definitely not my last! Press is my new coffee shop and I'm excited about. Coffee delicious, service great and the cafe is spotless. Kudos to Press for doing right!"}
{"text":"After hanging out at Cartel all week I was skeptical how Press would compare.  Had a fantastic macchiato!  Baristas were very friendly."}
{"text":"Their coffee quality is excellent and professionally made with beautiful cafe art. My favorite drink here is the Cortado."}
{"text":"Was pumped to see a local coffee roaster so close to where I was staying in Scottsdale. Made this a priority visit one morning while we were getting ready to get up into the mountains for a hiking adventure. 

I normally give all the coffee shops I visit five stars. They are, after all, selling my favorite beverage. Press Coffee picks up four stars simply due to lack of effort on behalf of the staff. Don't be deceived - the coffee was delicious and the atmosphere reeked of hipster coffee goodness. It was just a bit \"off.\" 

I ordered two drinks - vanilla latte and a nitro to go. Because the nitro is normally served in a frozen glass, they were confused how to serve me one to go. They offered a dixie cup size (less than 4 ounces) and then relented and offered a small plastic cup. I was baffled that they couldn't serve the nitro in a larger plastic cup or even in a regular paper cup. Staff were busy talking about work hours and correcting each other about the drink sizes than trying to problem solve. In the end, both drinks were outstanding, but the experience was soured by the nitro foul up. 

It will be on my list to try again when I make it back out to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I absoloutely love this place.  Great Coffee, Americanos, and Lattes.  Try the Chemex if you are looking for something unique.  Very Tasty Breakfast Burritos and friendly staff.  I wish the North Location was still open, but I'll take their brews anywhere I can get them.  Skip Starbucks and hit up a real coffee shop..."}
{"text":"Great Coffee, Friendly Staff and locally owned.  My favorite coffee spot!"}
{"text":"We came across this coffee shop after eating at a restaurant across the street.

I was excited that the coffee is inexpensive here compared to the last one we went to in Flagstaff! 

This might be our new place to go to for coffee! 

I ordered the cold brew 16 oz coffee and it was really strong! But a good strong. I like more coffee on the sweeter side so I had to add milk and sugar but I didn't mind.

Next time I'll try one of the iced lattes.

The building is unique, White and black interior and exterior."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite shop in the east valley. The Barista's always treat me like I am their friend. 

Its a great spot to meet up with old friends and catch up! The natural lighting is to die for and its seriously beautiful to look at. 

I love coming here and will continue to be back! 

Press Coffee, you're doing a great job! KEEP IT UP!"}
{"text":"I visit at least 3-4 times a week. It's one of my favorite early morning spots. Do not let the long line discourage you, it moves quickly and efficiently. The employees are all very friendly and the atmosphere is minimalistic and very clean. The coffee is delicious and sure does its job! Very hip spot."}
{"text":"Very Clean, great food Had the Burrito, and was delicious, got the Nitro Coffee, and oh my dayum,,, Caffeine.. Wasn't quite ready for it, but it worked !! 

Only down side is late opening, since I work 530 am.. Would be nice to stop by on the way in ... But I will be there often... similar to Peixoto but they have Food !! Kudos... Someone take a pic of the menu.. I forgot to..."}
{"text":"Press is our Go To coffee spot. Nice staff, really great cortados and some of the best breakfast burritos around. We both get the egg, potato & cheese burrito with chipotle sauce and add avocado (probably why we can't afford our dream house)."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times to meet folks for coffee, breakfast or just a quick stop to purchase coffee beans for a gift.

Tried the avocado toast and iced tea recently on a Saturday morning at 10 AM. The place was very packed...it was the BFT (bacon, feta, tomato) half toast but they gave me the full toast instead. The bread was multigrain and it was seasoned well. Total bill was ~$10, not too bad. My friends enjoyed their coffees and had free refills on all of our drinks as well. Also, the decor is lovely and spacious. The staff is very friendly and even complimented me so that was a bonus as well. :) 

Will definitely be a go to spot especially since we live so close."}
{"text":"Press has got to be the most depressing coffee shop I have ever been in. The walls are dull, the music is dull...everything about it is dull even the pastries. The only thing that saves it is the coffee...they've even taken out the comfy chairs since the last time I have been in. Bottomline, the store is no soul...even the art for sale on the walls fails to lift the spirit of the place. How about some colors on the walls instead of the mortuary feel.

In retrospect, I found their City North location to be a lot more inviting and colorful with food, atmosphere and personality to match.  Unfortunately, they have closed their doors. The Scottsdale location is really depressing to look at and truly lack personality. Other than the charming baristas, there is nothing about this coffee house that I find warm. In fact, I feel the exact opposite about it. I don't like the vibe, cause it does not have any.

The latte was nothing to rave about...Okay, a little latte art but the espresso really lacked body.

The croissant was an absolute disaster and tasted more like a neglected piece of dough....All of the pastry case is an abomination to look at. Really Steve, you need to have to kick ass pastries for your coffee shop...have some delivered by MJ Bread, figure out a way to make them yourself and taste good...even Olive and Ivy makes better croissants than you do.

I really wanted to write a positive review, but really I am disappointed.

...And then again...you have never responded to my review which shows how very little you care about customer feedback and input. It's really too bad..."}
{"text":"Really friendly employees and magnificent modern atmosphere. Space is small, but feels spacious. They have tables that are private, perfect for studying."}
{"text":"Beautiful space at a fun location... staff is friendly and laid back. By far the best espresso drinks in the valley!"}
{"text":"The staff here is so great! Everyone that works here is SO nice!! They will definitely help you find your perfect drink.
Their iced teas are delicious!!! Get the Mediterranean mint ice tea!

I'm not that big a fan of the coffee... But that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"I am a PRESS fanatic. The girl that helped me explained each roast and what she recommended for a pour over. Good coffee shouldn't require loads of cream and sugar. I drank mine black and and it was AMAZING. I've gone back numerous time and the service is outstanding every time. The avocado toast was super hearty and enough to feed two people!"}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, and great coffee.  I love the vibe of this place.  It is great to come here and relax or get a little work done.  I like their bakery items.  My fiance had a cold brew and said it was excellent.  Gotta go back and try out some more things!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite coffee shop! They have rich, smooth roasted coffee, not bitter. My favorite is either cappuccino or latte served in a big thick mug.  I love that I can order fresh cooked poached eggs and sprouted toast, while my kids order fresh muffins from a local bakery.  When I go for lunch, I make sure to order the honey lavender kombucha on tap. The café has a nice vibe, with plenty of sunlight and modern decor. They even have a few tables out front, and a cornhole game in the grass. The staff has always been very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Well, they done done it. Press is officially on the almond milk bandwagon.

They make one helluva thick, rich, low-calorie, nutritious almond milk latte, and I know Snapple has underserving dibs on the slogan, but I dare say one of these bad boys is made from the best stuff on Earth."}
{"text":"If you love good coffee, this is your spot. Period. 

It's fairly small, so not tons of seating and seating is a bit cramped."}
{"text":"I live this place! I would go here everyday if I could afford it. The coffee is good and the costumer service is fast and very nice."}
{"text":"Got an Americano and thought the espresso was weak. Place has a stale vibe and the gentleman barista was very monotone. It made me not want to be in their. My 2 friends felt the same way. Can you say overrated ?"}
{"text":"I've been a regular at Press Coffee for years for several reasons.  I love the atmosphere, very clean and bright in a warm way.  The only thing you really need to know about this place is that the staff and the owner is absolutely passionate about roasting and brewing coffee.

I've watched staff debate the absolute best way to brew a specific cup.  I've been asked to try a new brew method or grind and have yet to be disappointed.  I've talked with Steve ( one of the owners ) about his trip to South America to meet with coffee growers directly.  I've been impressed.

The true tell on how great Press Coffee is and why so many people love it is that I can drink their coffee black and it tastes amazing.  I've gone to so many places that pour asphalt into a cup, add corn syrup plus white color then call it coffee with a kick.  Its called not having to pay for good baristas because we serve corn syrup with caffeine.

So next time you're there try one of the cups black, I recommend the Amarro Gayo.  In between the rich earthy coffee flavor, you can actually taste the coffee's natural sweetness.  Press is one of the few places in town that has enough passion about coffee to be brave enough to serve coffee that way.

PS: Lea C. Give it some time, after sucking down high fructose tar at Starbucks you tend to forget what good coffee can taste like.  Once your taste buds come out of hiding good coffee will come back to you."}
{"text":"First of all, I love that they do free refills on their coffee, especially since I work across the street.
It's a small location, but it's packed all the time! They have great iced coffee, but even better hot coffee. It's jam packed with caffeine which makes a huge difference when you're falling asleep while walking into work. 

The staff is really sweet and very talkative so it's a nice place to interact with others. 

I guess the location can be inconvenient for people who are just trying to pick up something quick and jump in the car and go... Since street parking is extremely limited and parking garage experiences can be a pain, so just keep that in mind.

Food wise, you HAVE to try one of their breakfast burritos, the ingredients are incredibly fresh and well priced for being in Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"This is a neat little cafe, in the heart of Scottsdale quarter. I ordered a Chai Tea Latte, and it was fantastic. They do cool latte art as well, which is something you don't see at your everyday Starbucks. I enjoyed the chat I had with the barista, he was very personable which made me feel like a valued customer! That is very important!"}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops in the valley. If you're near the Scottsdale Quarters and want a quality cup or coffee, mocha, chai, anything you need stop by."}
{"text":"Love the setup in here. Long and narrow, just how I like my coffee shops; I can always find a table close to the wall. Friendly service.
The Nitro on tap, creamy cold goodness is amazing for people that don't like adding creamer. I'm in every time I'm at the Quarter, see you soon!"}
{"text":"Alright! A really good coffee place. So, I went here on my coffee tour of Phoenix (ftw) yesterday with the Bf. He got a hot latte and I got an iced latte. They were both very good. The barista was also very friendly and knowledgeable about coffee. She explained that they have a new espresso machine that uses varying pressures when pulling the espresso shot, which makes for a more smooth coffee. Smooth, it was! Both the iced and hot lattes were not acidic and just had a very pleasant smooth coffee and milk flavor. Also, the foam to latte ratio was very good on the hot version. I will definitely be coming back here.... yum and yum. This may be a new front runner on the coffee tour."}
{"text":"I love this location of press! The service is super friendly, the milk is steamed to creamy perfection, and the food is even good! I love that you can get half an avocado toast for around 3$.... Add a runny egg for 1$..... Best, cheap breakfast around. If you wanna step it up, order the feta and bacon avocado toast....so good. Press is a welcome addition to the downtown coffee scene."}
{"text":"Quality, quick, and quaint. The environment was clean and the baristas were friendly. Refreshing over all. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place has the best chai tea I ever had and the staff is super friendly. They are not cheap with their drinks--usually fill it to the top. The tempe location is also super nice with friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had a cortado with the blend containing the Ethiopian roast. It had all of my favorite flavors in a cortado. It was smooth with a fruity aftertaste. 

I also had a pour over, also the Ethiopian blend (single origin). It was full of flavor with hints of berries, and a sweetness that I love. 

My only concern is that it does not have a bathroom. Other than that, this place is excellent!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, and even better service. Ordered a vanilla latte with almond milk, one of the best I have had in Arizona. All of the employees were super friendly, and it was a great place to work for a few hours. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to get away from the Starbucks madness. Their coffee is excellent and you can actually order a small, medium or large and have people know what you mean! They have tables outside as well if you like to people watch and free wifi."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is a wonderful spot in sunny Scottsdale! I love their almond milk chais and avocado toast. Their pastries are always fresh and the coffee is strong. We often take our food to go and sit out by the splash pad. Press is a great place to grab a delicious bite and a refreshing drink for any one who loves the upscale, 'Dale vibe!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh Press. After my second visit here I feel like I can review it now.

I REALLY want to like this place but each experience has been so different that I don't know how many more times to try them.

I ordered the toddy the first visit and it was not very good. At all. Tasted burnt and very watered down. Second visit, I thought I would give the toddy a second chance but the lady behind the register thought I said \"16oz coffee\" instead of Toddy (hey, it happens) and actually, the coffee was delicious, so it was a good mix up. My girlfriend ordered an Iced Dirty Chai and it was actually very very good. Next time I'm there, hot coffee or chai it is.

I went back to press and the Toddy is improved now, and it's quite enjoyable. Pour over coffee selection is great now, too."}
{"text":"Great little coffee place in Scottsdale Quarter. Friendly staff, fresh brew and decent outdoor seating. Can't really ask for much more :)"}
{"text":"I just love little coffee shops like this! I ordered an Americano with just a splash of almond milk and it was SO GOOD! The espresso was nice and smooth and didn't have a burnt taste.

The coffee shop also has an assortment of loose leaf teas that you can enjoy and offers some nice looking baked goods.

Don't drink dairy milk? No problem! They offer soy and almond milk."}
{"text":"Wonderfully friendly staff. Macchiato was perfect. Upscale shopping area doesn't steal from the appeal they create in here. Had zeppelin playing late at night. Happy and relaxing place. Cool local art too."}
{"text":"The newest member of the Press family tree brings all the delicious coffee to a new neighborhood. The manager of this new spot was a long-time barista at my favorite location. Jimmy brings passion for great coffee and happy customers to a whole new crew here. The vibe makes me want to stay a long time to read or study or to meet a friend for a long chat on the cozy couch. If you come in for a cup make sure you took behind the counter for a second and check out the espresso machine. It's a thing of beauty even before it's used to make you a perfect latte. I'm thrilled to see a local favorite expand to more spots across the valley (although I will continue to miss having my latte hand-crafted by the legendary Jimmy at my regular Press)."}
{"text":"The only thing that could make this coffee shop better is a designated parking space for regular customers. On the other hand, parking in the garage means that your car is in the shade during the hot AZ summers. Because Press is located in Scottsdale Quarter, it can often be a busy place, but the staff is always friendly--even when there is a line of under-caffeinated customers. 

Unlike a lot of other coffee shops, I have to say that I love all of the coffees and drinks they offer. There is a wide range of traditional espresso drinks, and other more modern items like blended frozen drinks. Everyone is very knowledgeable of different tastes and flavors, and they are happy to build you a custom order for whatever you're craving. They not only offer coffee by the bag, but also stock a good selection of at-home coffee products such as Chemex and Clever coffee makers and filters. 

The food here is also really good! The breakfast burritos are build-your-own, and the muffins and biscotti are wonderful. I believe they come from a local bakery, but I can't recall the name. 

Nothing like sitting here for awhile with a delicious drink and a tasty snack. They are also very laid back about people coming in for a few hours to study or use the internet. They quickly learn the names of their regular customers, and always seem to find a way to make my experience both personal and enjoyable.

I should also mention that they offer cuppings at their roasting location. This experience was above and beyond as well! You not only get to sample the coffees, but you meet the roaster and she teaches you all about coffee in general and Press's specific sourcing and roasting processes. It's a great way to get to know the coffee you drink and the people who make it possible!"}
{"text":"The wait is often way too long, but it's a good place to hang out or have a meeting and the staff is always friendly.

A lot of this may come down to personal preference, but I'm just not a fan of their coffee. Their iced tea is always good and, although their food is pretty good, it's way too small for the price. Better for a snack than breakfast, per se."}
{"text":"High quality roasts (tried two different types of espressos and one was better than the other, but both were pretty solid) and friendly staff at a very reasonable price point.  It's a busy spot so be prepared to wait 5 minutes or so for your cup depending on the time, and it's slammed later in the morning as opposed to early not so slammed.  Anxious to try what appears to be pretty affordable food items too for breakfast or an early lunch/brunch."}
{"text":"Best damn latte I've had in ages!!"}
{"text":"Live right above this little coffee shop. 
Cool spot, it's usually never busy. 
Ordered the breakfast food a few times and have been disappointed so stick to the drinks."}
{"text":"Nice place for a coffee spot. Great tasting lattes. Packed on Friday at noon. I like their friendly service and their ridged cups, no need for hot cup sleeves. I'd loved to come here more often if it wasn't such a pain parking. Street parking is always packed but there is a garage nearby with lots of space. However too much to go through for quick coffee fix but if I'm at Scottsdale quarters or Kierland across the street, I'd make sure to stop by here."}
{"text":"Great coffee experience. Every cup I have had was uniquely made. Go here now frequently to enjoy a good cup of coffee. Enjoy the atmosphere. Service is excellent"}
{"text":"I buy my beans from a roaster who is a friend of a friend in Michigan. I've been looking for a local roaster for a while and Press Coffee ALMOST replaced my usual.

As a coffee shop this place deserves a 5. If you need a coffee fix then come here. As a roaster it was so close to replacing my go to place. If the selection were a bit better or the prices were a touch lower I would have made the switch.

Definitely worth visiting and if you want to take some beans home, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordering breakfast here takes forever.  We had to get to Boulders and the burrito I bought took 30 minutes to make.  WTF.  Put some fake eggs, cheese, and bacon into a tortilla and nuke it.  We ended missing our tee time but at least I had my 30 minute breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Oh yes.  Just what the doctor ordered.  

Press is a super clean, modern coffee shop located off of McQueen in Chandler.  The inside is welcoming, albeit a bit small, but ready for you to pop a squat and get some work done.  My personal preference just moving here from IL, though, is to sit outside and enjoy the palm trees, sunshine, and fountain. 

As for the coffee, it's about as good as you will find anywhere.  They're already winning awards  for this stuff.  They have about 5 different roasts at any given time, as well as offering Cold Brew and Nitro Cold Brew (and even Kombucha, if you're willing to spend some $$) on tap.  They also sell some food.  I tried the breakfast burrito and loved it.  They sell some pretty sweet merch, as well, like Healthy Human bottles and T-Shirts.

The service is great, attentive, and kind.  Let's give this place some business and keep it around."}
{"text":"Visited this location on Sunday morning. Great flavor on my drip coffee and reasonable price. 2$ for a 12 oz I think. 

Also ordered a Morning Glory muffin - I forget what that means, but it was good!

They had one person taking orders and one making the drinks so I ended up waiting about 10 min total before I got my coffee. 

And FYI the drip coffee is just poured into your cup. It's not the grind your beans, single filter it into your cup, kind of drip coffee. Not like Echo Coffee - they say drip coffee and it takes at least 5 min to drip your coffee individually. 

Still a very good cup of coffee in an area that's full of Starbucks and other sub-par coffee spots."}
{"text":"This is really great coffee. The place is cute and smells incredible. I love their rich dark roast coffee on it's own. No bitter burnt taste. I also tried a hazelnut latte with double espresso and half syrup. When I finally landed back on earth, I realized this latte was perfect. The dirty iced chai latte with almond milk was good too, but a little sweet to order again. I will probably stick to plain brew from now on. I have a bag of Twitch beans sitting in the cupboard beckoning to me right now. It's worth fighting parking to have a delicious coffee fix."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe here. First visit and I can taste the freshness. So far I enjoyed their cold brew and dirty chai both were a hit in my book. The shop is clean, customer service is friendly! The bathroom mirrors are plush - perfect for a selfie!! WiFi works well and parking easy to find."}
{"text":"Best coffee place. The vibe, the people. This is where I start my day, when I need to just chill out and get my 15 min to myself before the world weighs in on me. 

Only place for me"}
{"text":"Absolute worst drip coffee on the planet. Charcoal. Tasted a lot like Caribou. Internet didn't work either.

Edit: My brother and I visited this place and initially thought it was really nice. We really wanted to like it. The owner's asinine replies to this review and other reviews further solidifies that we will never visit this place."}
{"text":"Came in just to grab a coffee and ended up ordering an excellent breakfast burrito too. Great coffee, food, and ambiance - highly recommend for coffee enthusiasts!"}
{"text":"Hazelnut Mocha with or without Chocolate is AMAZE-BALLS"}
{"text":"By far our favorite coffee place in Scottsdale! Coffee is fantastic and reasonably priced.  All the food items we had were great.  Can't wait to return."}
