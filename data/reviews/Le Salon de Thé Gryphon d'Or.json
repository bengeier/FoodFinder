{"text":"My gosh!  This place actually looks like a hole in the wall from the street...but once you walk in...it is quite quaint! Went there for brunch...the coffee and tea is self serve, and the waitress who served us was funny and very nice. Had the half and half...would for sure go for that again! Challah bread with strawberry shortcake 'stuffing' and a poached egg with bacon on bread with the most amazing sauce...with fruit and potatoes! Also they had board games! Played trivial pursuit with my family while waiting for our food. Loved this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"A small restaurant on Monkland Street. Very nice service. I had the half and the half (rarebit benedict+caramel apple french toast). It tastes good but nothing special... not impressed. I'd say the egg benedict is better than the french toast as it's served on a scone! For me, the french toast is not sweet enough and the cream topping is too watery. But I would still recommend this place because of the nice ambiance and service."}
{"text":"Great place to go with kids. They have kids books, and adult board games to keep you busy while you wait for your meal. The food have a great flavour,good portion, and great service. Very laid back place The only thing lacking is there is not a lot of selection in the menu. Very nice people work there."}
{"text":"I went there for full afternoon tea with a friend today, and as usual, the food and service were impeccable. Down to the warm homemade scones, clotted cream, lemon curd, and raspberry jam, the bottomless delicious tea, and the tasty savoury sandwiches, it was a wonderful experience. They also provide a selection of mini desserts, and the strawberry shortcake (with the homemade clotted cream) was to live for. Seriously. It's only $25 tax included and it's a casual yet lovely place to spend a few hours. I could not recomend it more highly. The owner Donna is also one of the kindest women you'll ever meet."}
{"text":"Had a meeting with a friend over lunch last week. Their tea and scones are yummy but the chicken soup was cold and the meat was hard....  as for my friend she took the quiche it was a tiny portion as well as the salad which was small as a table d'hote portion it looked disappointing. Really not a great food experience the service was friendly but the food was so so to say the least."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a unique and delicious brunch, this is place to be. The quality of the food more than makes up for the size of the establishment and length of the menu (tiny!). Highly recommend the generous portion of rarebit eggs \"Benedict\" and stuffed French toast which are out of this world. We will surely be back.  The only negative was the self serve coffee/tea which was heavily watered down and tasteless. For a tearoom, I think the coffee/tea should have been better."}
{"text":"The Gryphon D'Or is rapidly making its way into becoming one of my favourite places in Montreal. The staff is exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable, and the whole place gives off a strong warm and homey feeling.   We went there with a reservation for afternoon tea. We were seated as soon as we went in and were asked to look through a selection of pots containing tea leaves. Once we made up our mind, we were presented with a teapot and a basket of absolutely delicious scones with some homemade jam, lemon curd, butter and heavy cream. The scones came directly from the bakery next door and were fresh off the oven. I could have them for the whole day if they weren't so very filling. The toppings were a bit sweet and go better with a slightly bitter tea like the Celtic comfort I had. Then the 3-level tray came with some smoked salmon on crackers, a selection of small sandwiches, and an extensive dessert tray. Other than the scones the desserts were definitely a highlight. We had small pecan tarts, shortbread cookies, chocolate mocha cake, strawberry shortcake, and lemon squares. Everything was delicious!  I can't wait to return. 5/5"}
{"text":"This is a nice little tea room. Very colorful and has a homey feel. Small boutique space, limited seating. If you are going for tea, then you must reserve it at least 24 hrs in advance. The owner and staff are very friendly and attentive. We went for afternoon high tea. Decent selection of loose teas. The scones with house made toppings were amazing. The finger sandwiches and desserts artfully arranged on a tiered tray. Everything was very tasty. We had a nice relaxing tea, such a fantastic way to round out our trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is honestly one of my favourites in Montreal. Not only are they the best Scones in town, they also have amazing stews, desserts and tea. A tiny hole-in-the-wall place, Gryphon D'or has all the quaint charm of the caf√©s of yesteryear. There are board games and they are starting activities on Saturday nights (like group knitting, and I am so there). The food is what my momma would make of she were a better cook. The service is absolutely exceptional. The owner, Donna, knows everyone's name, presumably by magic. Go here! Order a hot butterscotch (trust me)."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I've lived on Monkland for several years and walked by here so many times without trying it. Can't believe it took me so long to do so! Gryphon d'Or is probably one of Monkland's most unappreciated gems.   Although known for their brunch, I went for dinner. The veggie-nut burger on a butter scone bun is to die for! My boyfriend had the meatloaf burger and loved it as well. All the meals come with soup, salad, tea/coffee, and dessert for a total of $15! We had the chocolate chip pie for dessert (Oreo crust, with pecans, chocolate chip cookie \"filling\", vanilla ice cream, and chocolate sauce), which I think is what has been missing from my life it was so delicious.   The two owners are so sweet and nice, they make eating here even more pleasant than it already is. I seriously cannot recommend this place enough. They are open for dinner on Monday nights now too, so we will definitely be back many more times!"}
{"text":"Came here for weekend brunch and had a half and half (half eggs Benedict, half French toast) and loved every morsel. Brunch comes with tea, coffee and water (self-serve) and was $15 all included.   Although I was extremely stuffed afterward (I couldn't even finish my plate since it also came with fruit, salad, and homefries) my husband and I wanted to try the scones \"plain\" and wandered over to their bakery two doors down. Oh my goodness there were so many delightful small cookies and sweets (free tastings!) that we ended up buying more scones and sweets \"for later\". I've never tasted a scone quite as delicious as from here -- buttery like a biscuit but without crumbling and flaking all over the place.   I love the idea of brunch but I balk at the idea of spending money on eggs and toast that we can make at home. But the food here is one-of-kind and not something you could easily make for yourself. It was a great bargain considering I'm still stuffed 6 hours later!"}
{"text":"This place is a lesser known gem in Montreal. The first time I went it was for the scones, and then we couldn't resist the split pea soup, and enjoyed one of their signature shortbread cookies. Now, I visit this place for a casual sconewich every time I'm in Montreal. The place delivers a delicious wholesome meal every time I visit, with a scone sandwich (vegetarian or meatloaf), and side of soup and salad, always topped off with a shortbread cookie. It's excellent value, and the owners are just lovely and really seem to know their regulars. Love love love it!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed, their rarebit eggs bene is amazing!! And if u can't decide you can do half and half which is a great way to sample the fantastic food!!"}
{"text":"Amazing menu, delicious food, good staff, comfortable seating, good parking even.  All portions are large. Delicious French toast and Benny, unlimited tea and coffee self serve"}
{"text":"It's rarely that it happens that you walk in to a restaurant at the fag  end of the lunch service extremely hungry and you are told that they have stopped lunch by now but the person apologises ever so genuinely as though it is their fault we walked in late and even hands out the yummiest free scones to make sure you don't leave them hungry and disappointed .not only that they even tell you which place may still be serving lunch at 02:30. My husband and i were taken by surprise at how nice the person who greeted us was who tried to serve us to the best of her abilities even though we couldn't eat there. This time around i missed the brunch hour but i will make sure i go back there again :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful little cafe. Serves coffees, speciality teas and amazing menu selection of comfort foods. Just tried their Mac & Cheese and its heavenly! All their dinner items comes with Salad and a small soup option. The service is very friendly and staff are very nice and helpful. Well done."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Cute ambiance. One of my favourite places for a relaxed meal."}
{"text":"The best scones I've ever had! And they have frozen scones you can bake at home (I did and they turned out great). Generous portions and affordable. A little gem."}
{"text":"Best home made comfort food in Montreal.   Generously portioned meals, normally come with soup, salad and dessert.  Very reasonably priced too.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Finally I've found it, my go to brunch place!! Yes there are many fine brunch locations in Montreal, but I find that the menus are often similar at so many places and I've been searching for that homey brunch feeling. Well at the Gryphon d'Or I found what I have been looking for.   This is a small homey feeling restaurant with friendly staff. The menu, displayed on the blackboard, is short but very unique. We were a group of five so we got to sample most of the menu, perhaps the entire menu (ok it isn't that hard as I think that there were only 3 items on the menu). The two standout items are the Rarebit Benedict, a poached egg on a scone served with melted cheese, either bacon or roasted vegetables and rarebit sauce (made of sharp cheddar and dark beer), and stuffed French Toast, hallah stuffed with either home made strawberry jam or lemon curd. And the best part is that you don't even need to choose! You can order a plate that is half Rarebit and half French Toast. True genius! Many of the dishes are served with homemade scones and/or home made apple crisp. If you what you order doesn't come with one its worth it to order it extra on the side. The scones are to die for!   Everything we had was excellent and I can't wait to go back. Oh, and everything on the menu is only $14 tax included!!"}
{"text":"I came here but next door to the bakery where they make the scones fresh. I decided to pick up a few to surprise my mom because she's been dying to try them from word of mouth. I got there and a very kind lady greeted me and told me they only supply the plain scones fresh and the flavoured ones are bought frozen and she explained how to prepare them at home. She told me that because it was my first time, I got to try one free which was SO KIND. Anyways, I thought it was just an angelic treat -not too sweet nor salty, defiantly nice to have with a good tea. I bought half a dozen and I got a frozen blueberry batch to make at home. My mom absolutely loved the fresh scones and I'm dying to try the blueberry ones !  Defiantly  coming back for more fresh scones and I look forward to passing by for breakfast and /or tea"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite spot for brunch or afternoon tea. The food and tea is always delicious, but the owner is also what makes this place a true gem. I always feel at home when I'm there."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. Their quiche is incredibly mouthwatering, and the brisket is so tender, it just falls apart when you glance at it. I've had many tea dates with the girls here. And even planned an afternoon tea bachlorette party. The only downside is how incredibly tiny this place is. No room to even push your chair back to squeeze into the washroom. Other than the intimacy of it all, I love everything that comes out of the kitchen, including the lovely workers."}
{"text":"I always try to find the best scones wherever i go.  During my trip in Montreal, I found this cute little place that is known for the best scones and shortbread.  i made my reservation for tea time, but i should've just order scones, shortbread and tea only.  anyways, the scones and shortbread are really good.  but, it's still not as good compared to my favorite scones with double devon cream at lovejoy's tea room in San Francisco though.  my mission continues......."}
{"text":"Cute concept, but the tea and scones really leaves much to be desired.  I suspect the other items are much better - but come on!  A tea house starts with tea!"}
{"text":"Excellent tea room.  Many teas to choose from.  Great sandwiches and scones.  I loved the jams and lemon curd.  What sets this place apart is the atmosphere .  Never rushed or hurried.  It's a place to come in and stay as long as you would like.  They even box up any items you don't eat to take home."}
{"text":"Excellent all around tea house including staff.  Donna is a winner . A wonderful afternoon tea experience ."}
{"text":"So much to love about Gryphon d'Or! First and foremost, FREE bottomless coffee and/or black tea?!?!?!?   Second, they created a beautiful solution to the classic brunch dilemma: should I go for sweet or savory? Usually I try to solve this by going to brunch with someone who also experiences this and is willing to share plates, letting me get the french toast/pancakes AND savory eggs benny. But such a friend can be hard to find...Gryphon d'Or solves this with their 50/50 option: one plate with a piece of their stuffed french toast and one egg benedict (their version is an egg on top of a scone covered with gravy). I hope other brunch places around the world catch on, this is just such a good idea. Everything was flavorful and delicious, the fact that everything is homemade was evident in each decadent bite. My local guide was telling me that even if you just order the french toast, they will give you a tiny bite of something savory alongside it, and vice versa if you order a savory dish they will give you a little pot of something sweet with cream to enjoy. Saw another table enjoying the british tradition of high tea here.  The atmosphere itself is cozy and inviting with it's wooden interior and narrow layout looking into the kitchen where everything is being prepared. I would be a regular if I lived in Montreal."}
{"text":"I found the food(scones, cucumber sandwiches) fresh & to die for. the service impeccable. I'd go back there in a flash."}
{"text":"It is very small and the coffee/tea is self-serve. But, it was very good.  I always take it as a good sign when the menu is small. Usually, it indicates fresh ingredients and flavourful dishes.  Will go back :)"}
{"text":"I'm so impressed that I'm literally still sitting here and chose to write a review. We originally for the brunch menu but was disappointed to find out that it's only served on weekends, so we decided to try the meatloaf burger (on a scone) which was absolutely delicious, it came with a salad, carrot soup and desert. Everything was absolutely delicious !"}
{"text":"If I was able rate this establishment 10 stars out of 5 - I would. Renditions on classic dishes such as omelettes and eggs Benedict's were beautifully reimagined with local flavours and seasonal fruits. The service was hospitable and authentic. The bottomless coffee and tea more than compensated for the slightly higher prices.   The \"Half and Half\" and \"Omelette\" are a must-try.   Come with your friends on a cold snowy day - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly disliked this place. The attention upon clients it's bad, the order took so long that by the time they brought the food I wasn't hungry anymore. The order was taken around three times due to the waiter forgetting our order. It was loud and noisy and given that the review online said quintet I was surprised. They do not serve haggis anymore and that was the main reason I went to the restaurant. They do not have a big variety on the menu. And they told us that they stopped serving after six o'clock. We order a meat loaf burger and there were out of stock. I am not going back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"While staying just down the street on our honeymoon last week, we frequented the Gryphon a couple times  -- once for a delicious light lunch, and again for a peaceful late night pot of tea and dessert.  Both times I was blown away by the service, especially from the charming and funny cafe owner.  She gifted us a box of shortbread when I mentioned we were visiting NDG on our honeymoon, and was just generally hilarious and awesome.  My soup, his sandwich, the incredible chocolate cheesecake and scones -- the Gryphon's kitchen can do no wrong.  Definitely one of the brightest spots of our week in the city."}
{"text":"Review #155 is a special one for me & needs to go down in my book as one word: Blissful   I love this place,I went here for the High Tea experience with a good girlfriend & it was worth every penny. I had a great time & it felt like I was in a cozy,warm & inviting environment. Limited seating & clean,you can see the entire kitchen from the restaurant & I have a tremendous amount of respect for restaurants that are willing to be scrutinized by the general public. Coffee & water are self serve so don't be shy. Someone \"ahem\" almost got a marriage proposal that day & it wasn't me.  The table setting was perfectly British & the variety of teas was wonderful,I was tossed up between plum tart (the one I picked for the day) & ginger marmalade (for next time). They were kind enough to allow us to book a High Tea only 2 hours ahead of schedule since it was the middle of the week. Normally,a 24 hour heads up is requested so please be considerate on the weekends.  Everything is made from scratch in house except the butter,extra gold star. The scones were light,hot & perfectly crumbly. They were served with butter,lemon curd,sweet cream,dark caramel,raspberry jam & peach whiskey marmalade. The lemon curd & sweet cream used as a combo is what you eat to make the world a peaceful place to live in.   Since we called in at the last minute,we were able to have a few minutes in between services to enjoy the atmosphere,our teas & most importantly our company! When the three tiered serving stand arrived,the joy continued.  We were treated to a salmon spread with dill & lemon pepper served on a crumpet (4),yum. The sandwiches were cucumber with lemon pepper & egg salad (heart shaped!) on a mix of white & whole wheat,delicious. Concluded by the desserts,an upside down pineapple cake,chocolate cheesecake,pecan butter tart,lemon tart (squeal) & a shortbread cookie per person. My favourite was without a doubt the lemon tart,it was heavenly.  I spotted a customer's order of the strawberry shortcake in a jar (envy reared it's ugly head) & I'll order it next time. I've heard amazing things about the brunch on the weekends & I'll be going within the next few weeks,review to follow.  Curious about possibly throwing an event here,we were told that they should be offering a catering service soon. Let Donna & her team make an afternoon delight possible without too much work!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Quaint cafe with a delicious brunch menu. Note: this is a cash only cafe :)  Make sure to walk slowly or you might miss the cute little cafe!   We went for brunch today and had a lovely experience. I was debating between their omelette, rarebit benedict, and their stuffed French toast. Lucky for me that had a half and half option for the latter two that I eagerly selected. My mom ordered the classic and we both asked for our bacon to be burnt because that's the only way we like it. It was unlimited self-serve coffee, tea, and water.   When my meal arrived I was a very happy customer. My tasty scone was topped with roasted vegetables, crispy burnt bacon, a perfectly poached egg and the rarebit sauce. I had never had rarebit before, but if they are all like the one from the Gryphon I will be ordering it more often. The strawberry French toast was equally as delicious, with a fluffy toast, topped with cream cheese icing, strawberry jam, and whipped cream. The plate came garnished with two slices of citrus, salad, and roasted potatoes.  My mom enjoyed her classic with sunnyside eggs and even requested another scone. The mini apple crisp that came with her dish was equally scrumptious.  The service was quick and the waiter was extremely nice. Moreover, we very much appreciated the bacon being cooked to our taste as not many restaurants follow through with the request. The atmosphere was cosy and the art pieces on the wall were fun to look at and gave the restaurant some extra charm. I can't give this place 5 stars because the bathroom was quite unpleasant.  I will definitely be coming back to try their high tea. The waiter did give us a tip to reserve before coming as they make everything fresh and you never know how busy they will be."}
{"text":"Great food, self serve coffee.  Just how I like my breakfast.  I had the half and half meal."}
{"text":"Once a year I like to take a friend to the Gryphon. It has become a decadent, rich and lovely tradition. While I tend to wish for a more whimsical atmosphere (it is bare bones ...minimal in decor and 0% cozy factor) the home made scones and preserves are to die for as is the hospitality. Haven't found anything close to its' quality in Montreal. Just be sure to reserve your tea service in advance!"}
{"text":"Small, cozy, high quality food and coffee!"}
{"text":"On Mother's Day, my friend and I were lucky enough to grab the last table at Gryphon d'Or. My friend had hyped up the brunch here so I was stoked to have a table on a busy Sunday.   Food: We both order the 1/2 and 1/2 sweet and salty brunch. It came with 1/2 an eggs Benny with bacon and / or veggies. We got both. Next it had a stuffed French toast -- She got apple caramel and I got lemon-blueberry. Both options were absolutely to die for, no complaints on the eggs benny, french toast, potatoes or salad.   Service: It was a MISTAKE to only have ONE server that day. It might be a small restaurant but serving both the inside and outside of the restaurant with one person made for a long, long wait and sub-par service for sure. I have faith that this isn't the case normally and that Mother's Day was an especially busy day. Still, this watered down the whole experience a little bit.   Decor: Very cute, at home feel in the restaurant. Tons of wooden furniture and homey decorations.   Other: Interesting that the coffee and tea is self-serve in a sit-down restaurant like Gryphon d'Or. I can certainly see how this is useful on a busy day for staff. Still, I think it adds too much unnecessary traffic in an already-squished restaurant in a busy lane between the front door, cash and washroom."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to make of this place when walking in, there was very limited seated and not much in the way of decor . BUTTTT the food was excellent ! I went for brunch and will definitely be going back . you can actually see them cooking in a regular home style kitchen. I had their version of eggs Benedict and it definitely hit the spot ! fresh breakfast dishes all made to order and friendly welcoming staff you can't go wrong . BUT try and get there early or you may end up waiting a while for a table"}
{"text":"We had the Afternoon Tea, which was awesome!!! The scones and all the toppings are fresh made and go well with her teas. The sandwiches were so fresh and the salmon piklets were delicious. Her little mini desserts are also awesome, my favorite was the lemon bar. The fire alarm went off in the building, but that didn't bother us. We also mentioned that we were on our honeymoon and were gifted with a jar of her raspberry jam. All in all it was a really great experience, the proprietor was a lot of fun to talk to and really made us feel very welcome!!!! We might even try and go back for brunch before we leave"}
{"text":"Wonderful tea room served in a cozy atmosphere.   We need a place like this in Toronto. Afternoon tea is typically a snotty, pretentious experience - which, I mean, I enjoy sometimes, there's a time and place for that - but there are no down-to-earth tea places that serve great, homemade food, like the Gryphon d'Or.  There's a nice selection of teas, and this place is run by the nicest people.  The highlight for me is the food. I LOVE the food. And there is a lot of it! I left stuffed, and I am a very big eater.   The scones were deliciously buttery, and served with house made, delicious gourmet jams, which is the way it should be done (I'm side-eyeing you, Le Roselys, with your poor-tasting, jarred jams!). The best part by FAR is their exquisite caramel sauce. My god, I daydream about that caramel sauce more than I'd care to admit. Unlike every other caramel I've ever tasted, it's not too sweet. It's buttery and unctuous and just so, so good. I mean, the fact that they thought of serving caramel sauce with scones is just genius.   Their sandwiches are generously served - some in cute cut-out shapes, really nicely presented.  The desserts are also worth raving about. Everything's homemade and they clearly use the best ingredients. I loved the tart, the cookie, the cake...it's the perfect end to tea there.  This is a must-go for anyone visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Sastisfaite de ma portion , dejeuner tres sucr√©s mmm je m'en attendais :)) ca se rempli vite donc le mieux c'est d'arriver tot."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the outside but brunch here was on point. First of all, they have board games--nothing like a game of scattegories while waiting for food. I ordered the half and half--1/2 eggs Benny and 1/2 french toast. The Benny has a very unique and flavourful sauce rather than traditional hollandaise. The french toast was unreal--stuffed with apple and homemade caramel sauce. Great dish to get a bit of everything. Highly recommend!"}
