{"text":"Hi all,  Was working up here and came in a few times.  I have ordered the burgers and the sandwiches they have.  All pretty average.  One day I went in and the chef had some Indian food on.  I was told the best.  So I ordered.  It truly was the best.  He made his own chutney which was spectacular.  I have been told there are two chefs.  You want the lunch time one for the specials.  Good eats.  Drew"}
{"text":"Starter: Deep fried Pickles (best we've had)  Dinners: We order the roast beef dip and Jacks club with a side of gravy and fries well done.    My husband says best gravy he has ever had in his life!!   Food was outstanding!  Definitely going back with the whole family!"}
{"text":"Lovely establishment in the middle of nowhere! Very quaint environment with warm wood panelling, comfortable booths, the biggest chandelier you've every seen, flat screen TVs, classy bar and plenty of seating.  We ordered fish and chips and classic burger with fries. Both were very fresh, tasty and well presented. We've had both here before and are never a disappointment. After our meal we had a nice Milky Way cake with coffee, with top ups on the house. Decadent to say the least! Service was attentive without being overbearing. The price for the above and two pints was $52.00 which we found to be reasonable.  I'd highly recommend this cozy spot to anyone."}
