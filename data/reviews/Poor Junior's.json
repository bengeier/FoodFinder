{"text":"Pizza.Done.Right.  Our family has always struggled with ordering pizza - we all like different pies. We've found our new pizza! We all agree: fresh, hot, tasty pizza. Welcome to Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Tons of toppings! Fresh and piled to the top. Definitely a must go to pizza shop.  Ordered a large pizza and could barely get thru half of it with two people. Very well priced. Will be revisiting very soon!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is top notch. If you like real toppings on your pizza, nice crispy thin crust, sauce that doesn't taste like its loaded with sugar, and a nice smoky cheese than this is your new go to pizza place. I kept hearing about this place on facebook and from one of my customers at work and decided to check it out. Ordering was easy and the employee on the phone was super friendly and told us about all their specials. We got a large pizza with almost all the toppings they have and it was only 15.99 folks! I would have paid more than that for this pizza it was that good. Everything was so fresh and two slices filled me up no problem. They cut their pizzas different than most places. Instead of a traditional triangle they cut it in squares. I find it much easier to manage with all the toppings. This place is a hidden gem you need to go check it out!!!!"}
