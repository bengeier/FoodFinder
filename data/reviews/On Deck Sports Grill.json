{"text":"Went here once. My husband and I got a night out without the kids. We didn't want to drive very far so I told my husband about this sports bar that opened up right up the street from us. So we dropped in for a beer to check it out. We were greeted by a lady who looked less than thrilled to see us as we sat down at the bar. The first words out of her mouth were, \"the kitchen's closed, the bars closing soon, what do you want?\" It was 8:30 on a Saturday night. Really??? First of all, chill out lady, put a smile on your face, and give us a beer. I had decided within 30 seconds of being there I would never be back. The pissed off bartender served us a beer while making me feel horrible for being there. Do they hate customers this much?? Or at least she did. Why would they have this miserable lady working at the bar on a saturday when they are trying to build a business. Bad move. Also want to share that the atmosphere made me feel like I was in a subway. Reminded me exactly of a subway restaurant. Did not feel like I was in a bar. One last thing...are they closed?? Haven't seen it open in a long time. Living so close I drive by at least once a day. I wouldn't be suprise if they didn't make it."}
{"text":"Seriously? Closed at 4 again? Hard to patronize you regularly if you're not opened when you're posted hours say."}
{"text":"This sports grill is great! Dale, Kyle and Heather all went above and beyond with their service and we really enjoyed our time there. The sports grill is filled with sports memorabilia and Idaho gear. Have happy hour specials and a great menu!!! Best of luck to this local bar!!!!"}
{"text":"Ive been to alot sports bars and I must say this is among the top. Absolutely outstanding food and the service was steller as well. Very fun and friendly environment. Will definitely be going back and making this bar my regular spot. They have a great handful of hard to find beers on tap. You wont be disappointed if you come to this sports Bar"}
{"text":"I have never received worse service by any restaurant.  We, unfortunately, went to this establishment, for a poker tournament which we qualified for.  After playing poker for several hours and buying food  and beverages, my husband won a $25.00 gift certificate.  One employee told him he couldn't use it on the same visit, which was fine with us.  When they brought our tab, they had undercharged us about $30.00.  My husband pointed out the mistake and again asked if we could use the gift certificate.  The server told him \"Sure, no problem\"!  Then, the owner, Jeff, who had participated in the free poker tournament and had too much to drink, came out and got in my husband's face and proceeded to push him and threaten him for trying to use the gift certificate that he had won!!!  Wow, Really?!?!?!?!?!?  He was so out of line.  If he wants repeat business, this is not the way to get it!!!!!!!!!!  We will tell everyone we know to not visit this poorly run establishment!!  I hope they go out of business very soon.  This would be the justification for how he treated his customers!!!  Oh, and he tossed my husband & I out for trying to use the gift certificate, that he won!!!   WHAT?!?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"I almost missed this bar completely, its hidden but its a hidden gem! Very much worth checking out. I was surprised at how clean the place is and how great the food is.   Have to say, the best burger in North Phoenix, maybe even the entire valley. Great beers on tap, not the same domestics everyone else has."}
