{"text":"Friendly owner, great food. Greek dinners to hamburgers, it's all very good. We've been coming here for a long time."}
{"text":"Friendly owner, friendly staff, like family...  I can't get over how good everything is, from the gyros, burgers and souvlaki to the baklava and greek fries...   I daydream about this place sometimes...  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"It was 3:30 pm and me and my buddy went from Oshawa from to Whitby to grab some food. I ordered the cheese burger with fries for a very reasonable price. The person who took our order was very nice, lovely lady to talk to and the cook made a fabulous burger. Great music. It was a good time overall! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had a hair appointment around the corner from Nick's and I walked by on my way to my appointment. I'd always walked by and forgotten about it but decided it was time to try Nick's.   I came in at about 8:00pm and was promptly greeter by the owner. They have a deal for a gyro pita, fries and a pop, the whole. Thing came to less than $11! All of the ingredients were super fresh even though it was late in the evening. He was generous with the tomato on my pita which NEVER happens and I looooove tomato. The portion of gyro was huuuuge! And he offered to put fries IN the sandwich!  Yesssss!!!!!   It didn't take very long until it was ready and I headed home. The pita is gigantic, I honestly could have split it with my husband. But I wouldn't let him have any. It was delicious, the gyro was perfectly tender and spiced and the pita was soft and tasty. The tzaziki was served on the side, which was great for dipping the pita and fries. And the fries were perfect!  The owner was super nice and took a lot of care with making my food. I loved that! Will definitely be back to try more off the menu. They have a lot of options, like salads and shwarma and steak sandwiches."}
