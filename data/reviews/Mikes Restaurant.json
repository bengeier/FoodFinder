{"text":"Food was really good, I got the pizza rolls with the linguine it was v nice. A lil pricey for my liking though. Only down side was the server never gave us any water.."}
{"text":"Le service que nous avons eu avec la serveuse Kalina vallait franchement 5 étoiles! Elle était très cool et souriante toute le long même si il était rendu Minuit!  La bouffe était ok! Rien de particulier mais quand même un bon choix pour ce qu'il reste d'ouver dans ce coin de la ville à cette heure... oui le centre ville est rendu très poche.  Merci Encore Kalina!"}
{"text":"Good food but slow service! Although I didn't like the salmon eggs Benedict. The pancakes were amazing!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews after I finished my breakfast here !  The food was very good , the server was very nice , there is a free wifi, finally the meal deserve its price"}
{"text":"Had literally the worst service today.  The waitress did not take order until 30 minutes after sitting down, despite many attempts to get attention. Furthermore it took 45 minutes to get the food after we ordered and then they forgot one of the foods so we had to wait more time.  Then they promised free dessert and coffee but once we got the bill, they tried to add it in. Would not recommend as food was sub par."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service ever. This restaurant needs to rethink how it treats customers as apparently the customers are at the bottom of their  priority list. They need to train their staff to treat customers with respect. Given that their food is way below the standard of the amazing restaurants nearby, disrespectful staff will be their downfall. If you value your dining experience, avoid eating here."}
{"text":"Accueil ok, choix varie, service assez rapide. Legumes frais, pour la viande, j'en suis moins convaincu. Helas, serveuse peu douee pour l'ecoute active (Gabrielle). Pas de merci malgre pourboire ni d'au revoir. Correct si vous venrz de l'aeroport, avec decala horaire, qu'il est dimanche soir, que vous etes en face de l'Apple RetailnStore et souhaitez diner a proximite ;-)"}
{"text":"I must have blinked, and missed something, as I am not sure what happened to this restaurant. I remember coming here with friends in the 90s and it had big portions, reasonable prices and friendly service.   When you walk into this restaurant, it is amazing. The decor screams, we went through a restaurant makeover, look at us! look at us! And as a person who doesn't like change, I was leary but remembered that they had some good food here. It was busy but we were still seated quickly.   Looking over the menu, I noticed that it had definitely changed. Or did it? It still served pizza and subs, but MORE. The prices have definitely gone up, A LOT. I remember that my usual order of their combo contained had BOTH pizza and a sub, which were no longer on the menu together.   BTW, $3 for a soft drink and no refill.   The food is exactly like your neighbourhood pizza joint, very tasty.  The prices are more than I would have liked to spend.  The ambiance, WOW!!!!  So, food was still good, value no longer there."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast - The server was nice, the food was mediocre at best. My hollandaise was white as snow - and bland. The coffee was weak and boring. We ordered a side of bacon, and it was dry and limp. I'm not even sure how that is possible.  It was inexpensive: breakfast for two under $30, but I ended change from my server, and she rooted around in her apron for $5 in nickels and dimes! Not cool. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of ordering a plate and not noticing the plate included onions. The waitress noticed me picking at my plate and offered to fix it. I declined but my girlfriend insisted and I'm glad she did. They made the plate entirely over and it was amazing! The service was great, the food was great and the pricing was reasonable. Would come the next time I'm in Canada."}
{"text":"How do you say yuck in French? Kind of vibed we shouldn't have stopped here but we were hungry and had lost the need to be picky. Wine is bad. $10 a glass for really bad wine. And the pizza...well the dough is gross and the toppings tasted canned. The cheese processed. It was pretty gross. At $50 for two people. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Came here a month ago. The food was okay but overpriced in my opinion. The chicken wings are these little mini wings and they charge the same price as what you would get for larger wings elsewhere. We didn't order pizza but we saw many people did and many people were complaining about them. I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Going with low expectations, it was a quite ok experience.  Yes, it's a chain. The food is nice, the service was ok, and I have nothing to complain about beside finding it slightly overpriced (but then again it's St Catherine and even though there are a lot of good choices there, the bad options are not lacking)"}
{"text":"Great, fast-casual Italian restaurant with a little MTL flair. A great first experience in this lovely city for our first trip here.  We began with the sunshine dip which was a delicious concoction of cheese and wine accompanied by thin pizza bread wedges. Delicious!  I had the multigrain pasta with bolognese sauce. Delicious, meaty, flavorful, and very filling. It came with a side bread stick (the thick and soft kind). He had the roasted salmon with rice and vegetables. Delicious.  We topped off our dinner by sharing a slice of Tarte de sucre, which was a regional specialty apparently via its use of maple syrup. I thought it would be too cloyingly sweet, but it was an amazingly balanced treat.  Great staff, fun surroundings, lovely clientele. Good MTL soccer match on the tele as well.  I would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"In complete contrast to other reviews on here, I found Mike's to pretty well priced, actually..they even have a lunch menu but sadly it's only available on weekdays. A friend and I stopped in here for lunch after wandering around for a while looking for \"light Italian food\" which my friend wanted. I guess we didn't want to go to Guido and Angelina, the Italian place several doors down from this place. Anyways, since I didn't know this place, I decided to have something simple and not too overboard. I ordered a simple spaghetti bolognese with a breadstick and my compadre ordered a sub sandwich with a salad. Pasta was very well done but like all Montreal places that have pasta, they serve it up in the \"Montreal\" way and drown the dish in sauce which I don't like. Anyways, I'm not complaining as the dish was good. Service was friendly and efficient and the place was quite uncrowded on this Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Mike's on St. Catherine St. in Montreal has the distinction of being the first restaurant that my family and I have walked out of. My misgivings about the place turned out to be right. The menu reads like a Denny's, and while I have nothing against Denny's, it just wasn't the experience we were looking for, given the large number of eateries in the area. The person who greeted my kids was pretty friendly, giving them crayons and making them laugh, and giving us a nice table. But then the service went downhill from there. Our server was clueless - she was in the middle of taking our order for our kid's meal, and then someone enters the restaurant she knows, and she JUST WALKS AWAY from the table to shake his hand, make a reservation for him, and catch up on life. She is then gone for about 10 minutes, after she has spent time chatting with her acquaintance, and even gone to refill drinks somewhere else, etc. My wife was furious and asked for another waiter - no one ever showed up for minutes after that. So we just picked up our things and left. Reading the other reviews here, I think we dodged a bullet. We also informed our hotel's concierge and they have put Mike's on a \"do not recommend\" list, saying that this was not the first time they had heard about the service and \"I really don't care\" management."}
{"text":"Had breaky there this morning. Wait staff not really pleasant, had to ask for coffee re-fill after she walked by and looked at my coffee cup 7x without even asking. The bill was basically just plopped on our table without a word. I paid cash in the billfold and told her I didn't need change....she then proceeded to open the billfold and counted the cash out loud and stated you're good to go!! Really??? No kidding....didn't deserve the tip I left!!! Keep walking down the street until you find some other restaurant for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"We waited a while just to be served and no one came until maybe 15 minutes in saying we'd be served in a few. Another 10 minutes passed so we left. The food sounded appetizing but the service was awful. Avoid this place.  P.S. Their free wifi was a lie and I was actually connected through their neighboring restaurant \"3 Brasseurs,\" a much better restaurant by the way."}
{"text":"Mikes has some great tasty food, a good variety of choices and service is always fast. Food comes out kind of too fast sometimes which makes you wonder how it's all prepared..  Their stuffed cheese bruschetta rolls are my favorite appetizer, you can also get it combined with your meal if you order a \"duetto\" dish. It's pizza dough stuffed with cheese and tomato sauce goodness, for you to dip in a hot marinara sauce.  I've tried their gondola type pizzas but usually stick with their cream based sauce pastas like alfredo or rosée which just make my mouth water thinking about it now. They used to offer a special where you could add a salad for 1.99$ - their small cesar salad isn't worth any more than that, they are stingy with the dressing and it isn't quite creamy or garlicy enough for my liking.  I think Mike's should offer more table d'hote type specials otherwise getting a full meal is too expensive for this type of americanized chain.  Food is always consistently good but the main problem I have is their pricing. And that's why I'm taking 2 stars off.  Their portions aren't huge and I know many other places where you can get a simple alfredo or pasta dish for a lot less. The other main issue is their MENU. Mikes likes to offer a constricted, over priced, ridiculous \"Events Menu\" whenever there is something going on in town. Some fancier restaurants do this on special occasions such as Valentine's day which is understandable, but the Mikes near Place Des Arts in particular ALWAYS has an events menu. The one on Crescent luckily has fewer events going on and are usually focused around the Grand Prix weekend.  If there's a show playing, if there's a festival, if it's a special holiday, if there's a parade, an election, a storm - whatever, they offer this measly menu with only 1/3 of the choices and double the price. You're looking at an 18$ -20$ vegetarian pasta dish for example that comes with nothing.  So now when I feel like eating Mikes, I always call and ask beforehand if they're offering their tourist trap menu or not."}
{"text":"Food is decent but not worth the high prices.  The waitress we had was being rude and yelling at another younger waitress.  It would have been nice if she would have been doing her job, not yelling at another staff member."}
{"text":"We went to Mikes for dinner, and while the food was decent, the price is a little bit over the top. The service was great, the food were prepared quickly (and were very tasty). I really like the pasta menu."}
{"text":"Horrible food. This place re-heats frozen Costco crap for tourists, nothing is fresh and I honestly believe that the corporation that owns this dump of a chain doesn't have any chefs on staff.   It makes me livid that such a place survives in Montreal, but they have beautiful posters of food and the place is packed with American tourists who don't know any better and who will never return.  Go to any of the pubs around the corner on Crescent street and you will find good if not amazing food."}
{"text":"J'ai mangé une pizza, original pour un brunch ? Service très agréable et attentif. Restaurant bien pour une journée shopping sur la rue Sainte-Catherine."}
{"text":"to be honest we were looking for a simple casual affordable place for lunch. we stumbled upon miike's resto bar which has a good feel when you walk in. its very casual, but the prices don't really match up with the decor because it turned out to be more expensive than we thought. they do have specials which are plastered all over the windows which also attracted us here but i probably will not be back the next time i am here in montreal. the food was nothing special and was not memorable. that sucks though because the location is great for business."}
