{"text":"Pretty good!  Coconut shrimp and sesame chicken is awesome.  Crab puffs are great too."}
{"text":"Awesome! Food is amazing. Price is great. Service is super friendly and fast. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Always good quality food, everything taste great. Not to salty, and doesn't use any MSG which is a plus. I'm not vegetarian, but they have a lot of vegetarian options. They could work on their crab puffs though."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding when my large group met at this restaurant.  The food was good and I would dine there again."}
{"text":"The food is really not much better than what I can buy, and heat up from the frozen section.  It's all really bland, and whether you get orange chicken to the house special chicken, to the sesame chicken...it literally all tastes the same."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from here for years. Very consistent, courteous and the best orange chicken ever."}
{"text":"We went to this place for lunch because of the reviews on Yelp. We took advantage of their $4.99 lunch! I had the sweet and sour chicken with white rice and we were pleasantly suprised when it also came with egg drop soup! The place was clean, the staff was friendly, and the food was good! It wasn't too noisy or crowded which was nice and our server was very accomodating. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"First time I went here, it took forever to get our order. When we got the food, it was worth the wait!  We now order for take out and it's always hot and yummy!"}
{"text":"This was such a disappointment. Flaming pepper steak had no peppers or taste at all. Sesame chicken was dry and orange chicken was dry too. I tried this place years ago and thought id give it another try. Save your money."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. The staff is always very friendly and the food is fantastic. I highly recommend the orange beef. I go here pretty regularly and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Ordered delivery. Orange beef and spicy Kung Pow chicken.  Both with fried rice.  So much flavor on both dishes. Portion size was beyond ample with leftovers of both. The food arrived piping hot and in less time than expected.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Get the 5$ orange chicken with a side of chili paste, and you will never got to a Panda Express again."}
{"text":"Great lunch special! Had he orange chicken and it was delicious. Coworker had been recommending it forever and finally tried it- definitely worth a visit"}
{"text":"Unbelievable value for lunch. The Best orange chicken for an amazing price!! Definitely worth a trip for lunch"}
{"text":"Just ordered tonight.  I got the honey walnut shrimp and my husband ordered sweet & sour chicken.  The shrimp was smothered in what seemed to be mayo and cream cheese, it was really disgusting looking so I couldn't eat it until I wiped all of that off.  Not impressed with the dish at all, could only eat a few bites.  It was truly the worst meal I have ever ordered at a restaurant...in my life.  No joke.  The sweet & sour was edible but again, not impressed!  I have never seen chicken served like this at a Chinese restaurant; it looked and tasted like a frozen breaded chicken strip with sour sauce on the side.    Needless to say, we will not be eating here again.    For $30 plus a deliver tip this was highly disappointing.  I do NOT recommend.  I'm trying to figure out how they stay in business...surely they receive zero repeat customers?!"}
{"text":"They are always very consistent and have never been disappointed with my order.  Their delivery is quick sometimes surprisingly fast.  The portions are good size and we always end up with enough leftovers for at least one more meal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  K, yes i like fancy restaurants and enjoy a good $50 steak.  If you are looking for PF changs atmosphere this is not the place.  I can tell you this, you will not find a better Chinese place around for your money.  They are very inexpensive and huge portions.    They have a lunch special for $4.99 and a dinner combo special for like $8.75.  3 dinner combos feed's my family of 6 with left overs!  Seriously its great food.  My favorites are Walnut Shrimp, or the dinner combos with fried rice and sesame chicken or orange chicken.  Both really good.  My wife and I love their crab wantons, their egg drop soup, and their egg rolls are the best we have ever had.  Their lettuce wraps are great, a little different from PF Changs but good with a huge portion size.    Seriously they have been their for 10 years now and that has gotta tell you something.  Its good!  They do have some very regular loyal customers.  They also deliver too.  I live up in Sonoran Mountain Ranch so having them deliver is super handy.    Give my suggestions a try, i promise you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bland, bland, bland...  I've been here multiple times for take out,  therefore should know better by now.  This time,  the Ma Po tofu (ordered extra spicy) had absolutely zero spice to it, minimal flavor and, other than the large pieces of broccoli around the perimeter,  was nearly vegetable-less. Basically a pile of tofu in bland brown sauce with unseasoned broccoli.  I'll have to use the leftovers to reinvent this dish as something more palatable.   The orange chicken my friend ordered was fine. Nothing to write home about.  The crab puffs should have been called cream cheese wontons with basic sweet and sour sauce. Bleck.    If there were better options in this area, this place would not get such good reviews. But compared to...nothing...it's an edible option for pseudo-Asian food. Maybe. If you really have the yen..."}
{"text":"Yummy! We ordered takeout and it is FANTASTIC.  Very fresh and tasty.  So glad we finally found some good chinese near us!"}
{"text":"Great Food, really loved the Chow Mien and Sweet and Sour Chicken. A little annoying listening to the phone ring off the hook while you are waiting and eating. We did have to wait a while for the food, but it was overall very good! Only complaint about the food is the fried rice. Doesn't taste like fried rice at all. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service was nice. they are very friendly and have a nice environment here. But the food was very salty. I had a lunch special, beef and noodles. The noodles were by far the saltiest thing I've eaten. plus some of the noodles weren't fully cooked? might come back for rice next time. But not for noodles."}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious! You just can't beat their lunch specials. Orange Chicken, Fried Rice, and 2 Crab Rangoons - for under $5? - Such a good deal. Great food, nice staff, fast delivery! We love Bamboo!"}
{"text":"After receiving coupons for so long, we finally decided to try this place. DO NOT waste your money!!!!  It is the WORST place I have ever eaten!!!  Nasty!!!  No flavor, small bits of fatty boiled chicken and way over cooked rice.  I mean it's SO BAD that I wouldn't even have my dogs eat it!!!  Because the place was empty I'm sure the food was not fresh.  I picked up my orders.  I called to inquire why it was so bad but the guy would not speak to me even I was very calm and polite.  Nobody would call me back.  I've seen the other reviews on bad food & lousy customer service.  No wonder they give out so many coupons.  Save your money & go to PF Changs for the same price and get quality!!!  These people are a rip off & don't deserve to be in business!!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!!  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever encountered. My wife and I have been ordering food from this establishment for years.  We have been loyal customers for years. Last week I ordered steak that was raw on the middle and they told my wife we could just finish cooking the meat in the microwave. We put our usual order in this week and they made another mistake. The meat tasted sour and they forgot the teriyaki sauce that goes with the teriyaki steak. They refused to give me a credit for next time or refund my money.  They told us, their policy is to only give you credit one time for one of their mistakes and they would never refund anybody's money regardless of the situation.  I have never written a review, but I feel a obligation to warn as many people as I can. We work to hard for our money to have places like this STEAL from us."}
{"text":"What an interesting place place looks very nice inside when you walk in has an odd smell smells like sewer but not real strong butt off putting then there's something wrong with their air condition or their hoods or something cuz something's rattling and shaking all the lights and everything else in the store which is very annoying bathrooms are pretty disgusting think that's where the smell was coming from cuz it was stronger in there now for the food I had the beef and asparagus asparagus was good be tasted weird almost sour the sauce I meant care for try my sons kung pao chicken that was his gross I just spit it out crab Puffs were good that was the highlight FS Services really good he was on top of everything never need to ask for a refill was good of communicating and he gave my grandma free dessert which was awesome cuz she loves desert even though it was still frozen she still enjoyed it tiramisu was not supposed to be frozen by the way overall I Won't Go Back three stars is for the service"}
{"text":"The reason why I gave this place 1 star is not the food. I came here for lunch.  The Asian guy serving me gave ok service.  It was a standard lunch menu for Asian restaurants. $5.25 lunch, comes with an entree, 2 crab puffs, and soup. With tax, it's $5.79. It's not terrible, a little salty, but mediocre.   However, there was a (I'm assuming) Hispanic lady who was talking with a table, extremely loudly, laughing about \"Orientals\" and how we are bad drivers, among other things. Note that I said \"we\", as I am Asian. I wouldn't care about this, except, she works here. It wasn't just one statement. It went on and on. I was getting more and more uncomfortable. Unacceptable. I will not be back.   So, if you want mediocre food served with a side of anti Asian racism, here's your spot.   And to that lady, Asians don't like being called \"Oriental\". We aren't rugs, jerk."}
{"text":"What the.... no no no no no  First time here ...   1) fried rice.... it literally is dried out white rice with soy. There is one tiny bite (just one) with egg, no veggies, room temp ... worst egg fried rice ever   2) ordered yellow curry... the potatoes are literally frozen steak fries. Let that sink in.   3) just two tables including us on the place. Took almost until dinner was over to ask how everything was and if we need anything. Asked for check.   I want the last 20 minutes of my life back.   Best part of the meal ... the fortune cookies made elsewhere"}
{"text":"Hey Hey Az it's a gorgeous evening to sit out back with a cocktail and order take out ! This place is sure to entice , if you like spicy then Bamboo Cafe is for you . My favorite... spicy chicken friend rice and spicy orange chicken !  You can't beat the price and they deliver as always if you try it let me know what you think! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Really, to be honest I wish the food was better than 2 stars, only because I am sick of the large chain restaurant down the road. So the atmosphere was kind of cheesy and well the food, I may have made better food nuked by myself. It was very bland, and way too pricey for the lack of superb quality. Sticking with the big chain for now."}
{"text":"OLD MEAT!!! Need I say more.  this establishment needs to have a food inspector visit ASAP. My family and I were very very sick to the point I went to the hospital and it was ruled out to be food poisoning. I knew the beef & broccoli tasted funny but I just figured it was the large amount of sauce they put on the food. Nope the extra sauce was to hide the old meat. I will never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"We decided to give this a try after all the mixed reviews.  Our first order was general Tao chicken, sesame chicken and orange chicken. We liked the orange chicken very much! It's been a while for us to find good orange chicken. It could be spicy in our opinion but it is still very good. The general Tao chicken had way to much celery ( which I hate). Other then that it's good but not very spicy. Sesame chicken taste ok.  So if you are a orange chicken lover I for sure would give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"A stop at Bamboo Club was well worth it.  I had sweet and sour chicken.  The chicken was presented differently than any other sweet and sour chicken I've had.  Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery calamari and my egg roles were cold when we received the food.  I only live like 5 min away from the restaurant so really shouldn't happen.  My combo sweet and sour chicken was good big portions.  Really the only reason I'm giving it a three is because the main meals were warm and good.  Disappointed with the calamari and egg rolls tho. I was disappointed overall cause it's so close and I was hoping it would of been one of our spots."}
{"text":"Had the Kung Pao Shrimp on my first visit and it really was no better than the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce at Golden Rice on Thunderbird. Nothing to write home about. Go to Abacus Inn on 59th Ave. instead. However, Bamboo's lunch special at $4.99 can't be beat. The staff is friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Tried this place for first time . Was the worst Chinese I ever had would not feed this food to my dog .  It's not real Chinese food it's like the frozen food isle in a grocery store maybe worse than that ... Breaded chicken is not Chinese food and for sweet and sour chicken is bland and no fixings just breaded chicken like a chicken fried steak... sorry won't b back . It's also to pricey for bland fake Chinese and don't get Mongolian beef not sure what it really is."}
{"text":"Best Chinese spot in town, friendly workers and amazing food! Better than any other spot in Arizona."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, it isn't great.  The place needs some work though.  THe carpet is filthy, and varnish at tables is peeling.  The food taste ok, some of it but it looks so blah.  Looks like chef missed plating class.  My wife had the orange chix and you could taste the oil.  I had the mongollion beef which contained minimum amount of beef and a lot of onions.  A little tweaking, updating, and plating this could be a great place."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Slow, only one server for a full restaurant, he spent more time yelling at the cooks than serving those waiting for their food.  Food was just HORRIBLE!!  Only the Appetizers were edible.  Food was sloppy and didn't taste good.  We ordered three dishes and NONE of them were edible.  We will NEVER go there again."}
{"text":"Wow. What an experience but unfortunately not for the good. I came in not for the cheap lunch specials but to order a complete lunch 4 my wife and myself.  War wonton soup featured flavorless balls of chalky wrapper not  cooked through leaving a nasty chewy doughy texture waiting to get spit out. The wonton broth didn't seem fresh  but  more like powdered bouillon mix and bits of carrot and celery thrown in.  Let me know if im wrong.  The Kung Pao scallops were absolutely pathetic. When the water chestnuts are larger then the scallops you already have a problem. The scallops were worthless pieces of rubber band  after i bit  two pieces and spit them both out. I asked the waiter to try a scallop and he kind of grinned because he knew they were old. I asked him to taste the scallops and he just laughed me off.  I'm used to shitty service at very good Chinese restaurant but this was not the case.  My wife ordered the flaming steak and  after trying to slice this piece of leather and not finding a single decent piece to slice off due to grissle, tendon and   connective tissue i pulled out  my Spyderco to cut through.  Bamboo cafe cafe  advertises Choice steaks but this piece of cow was obviously less then Select  by the lack of marbeling, advanced gristle and tendon throuout . We left over 95% of the steak on the table and was waiting for the waiter/ maitre d to ask us what was wrong with the steak. Sadly and pathetically that question never came.  If you order a steak at a restaurant and the customers are not eating it should you not ask what the fuck is wrong with it?   My wife reminded me we had a coupon for buy one entree get one free so we ordered the pan fried noodles to go.  I brought it home for my mother in law.  What a final insult. So salty, my Chinese mother in law  thought i was insulting her.  I was ashamed to have offered this to her.  In 48 years I have never left a zero tip. I actually went to Taco Bell to get the taste of this shitty Chinese food out of my mouth.  I found the service lacking and unprofessional. Perhaps the Help Wanted sign on the front door will find a real Chinese cook. But pity that Chef if the owners continue to serve up the lowest quality ingredients to make a buck.  For those customers who claim this is the best the finest or even decent Chinese food shame on you.   I am NOT going to give one star because it will be eliminated I will simply give 2  stars and you can read this review for what it is thank you."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese food places. The orange beef is a must try! If your in the area its worth stopping in for!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese place I've had so far ! Food tastes really fresh and unique. Nothing like panda !"}
{"text":"Nice place, excellent service. Our party had two dishes: orange chicken and Mongolian Beef. Everyone was pleased with both. The soups, wonton and sweet and sour, were excellent."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for lunch! They give you egg drop soup, an entree with a huge portion of rice on the side, and two crab puffs all for $5.25! The food is super fresh and tastes amazing! The servers are super nice and even put your food in the To go box for you! Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"Steer clear of this run down dump!!!! IDK where to start with this place. The people on United flight 93 were treated better than I was. Very SLOW service, VERY poor attitude. I can't stand bad service. If you don't want to wait tables or have to provide a service to customers go work somewhere else. I had to shave twice in betwixed refills. Also don't offer free refills and then get pissed when I drink more than one coke. Listen I'm not looking for Morton's here but the officer's club at the Four Oh Double Natural was in better shape than this place!You can tell there is no pride in ownership and that the person or persons who own this business try to get by a cheap as they can. Now hey I own a small business, I know you need to save money where you can, you just don't need to do it at the expanse of the customer. A business should thrive because of it's customers not in spite of it's customers. To see what I am talking about you only need to visit one of the other restaurants in this very strip mall. This place gives off the feeling that it is held together by popsicle sticks and chewing gum. I'm afraid that if I sneeze to hard the whole place will fall apart at the seams. It must have taken a lot of effort to make a place in a building this new look so run down. There were nicer places in Berlin at the end of ol WWII. Now on to the food. The worst part about coming to this place is having to eat at this place. I'm afraid to think of what I was really eating... I really have to wonder how Subway a few doors down can turn a profit and still use fresh bell peppers, onions and spinach and this place feels the need to use produce that was swept up off the floor after a busy lunch rush at said Subway. Again pride in ownership. The owners clearly feel that using cheap second rate ingredients is the only way to make money. It really sucks too because when you blow the dust and hair off of the menu they have some things that sound really really tasty. The price also makes you feel like you are in for a treat. The Pièce de résistance of this meal would be the hour I spent getting to know my toilet. I spent the first 20 minutes forcing out what resembled a can of Campbell's condensed cream of mushroom soup followed by what I can only describe as 40 minutes of dirty sock water."}
{"text":"I can't say it's going to swoop you into the streets of Shanghai but the $4.99 lunch specials here are blatant American highway robbery. For soup, rice, a choice of SOMETHING, cream cheese wontons, sit-down service and check-splitting, I commend this establishment for keeping its head above water. I shall return."}
{"text":"This rating is based on the sweet and sour chicken dish.  The sauce was extremely thin and virtually tasteless. The chicken was breaded and appeared to be pan fried like a burger king chicken sandwich, then cut into a few long strips.  The vegetables seemed like they were frozen because they had absolutely no flavor.    The pork fried rice had good flavor and was on par with other restaurants."}
{"text":"This is far and away my favorite place for Orange Chicken, but I love every meal I have ever eaten here! The chicken is crispy, crunchy and the sauce has a great flavor. The service is always great whether its eat in or take out. A quick place for a weeknight meal or a leisurely evening out. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to give 0 stars to this Chinese place, in my life span I've been to a lot of Chinese places in the U.S. & I find this place to be amongst the worst & I will give you a few examples, their sesame chicken is rubbery and cut like pork, their general tso's chicken is cooked like chicken in spicy hot garlic sauce, their salt and pepper chicken is farce, this place has to take a hard look around them & change their cooking style."}
{"text":"Ignore everything you know about a chinese restaurant. This place is unlike and different than any chinese restaurant ive been too!! The service was friendly and the way the atmosphere was set up it was very beautiful and decorative. The portion i received was a decently large size!! I was very impressed with the experience i had. I only paid like 6 dollars for chicken and rice."}
{"text":"Main course good.  Egg rolls bland.  Great service,  green tea good,  wonton soup OK but wontons should NOT be made with ground beef!"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  It's clean, friendly, and food is great! I live in the neighborhood, so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I will never order again from them. I have been a loyal customer. The service that I received from Bethany was the worst . Rude would be a nice word for her. Long story short my orders are pretty big since I have a big family. Last Fri. I ordered food it took over 2 hours and was cold. I spoke to the manager and he gave me a rest. credit for $35.00 which was half of the price that I paid for the food. So a week later I order food totaling over $82.00 with a credit of $35.00. Once again ice cold food. Called and spoke to the hostess and she said sorry they need to hire more people they are short staffed. She said the manager would call me back.  Well Bethany calls me back, not a nice person. Trying to reason with her. She knew that some of the food was cold. But because this is the second time that I complained she told me that she would not do anything. I'm being polite. She was nasty beyond nasty. I will tell everyone that I know not to order from them. I will make it a point to let all of my neighbors and community know how they will be treated by someone who is arrogant and rude and does not care about her clients."}
{"text":"Nothing blew my socks off here. We were actually the only people dining in here, so you'd think the service would have been top notch, but take out orders were all over the place. It's obvious the area likes this place for Chinese takeout, but there aren't a lot of options. The potstickers were really good, but the entrees were a little lackluster. I expected more flavor. It's good for a quick fix, but I'll drive the 20 minutes to our favorite place next time."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was a bad day for the cooks, and other staff, but the restaurant was filthy. I ordered the Kung pao chicken and I was served microwaved sandwich turkey with Kung pao sauce and large bell pepper slices. I could not eat the food, it was so bad. The sauce turned the rice into a soupy mess, and the bell peppers were too big to eat.  My daughter ordered the orange chicken and it was soggy, also way too much sauce, she ended up with rice soup as well. I definitely will not go back."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken around.  Same style as the Bamboo Grill that used to be located off I17 and 27th avenue near the AMC Deer Valley 30.  Not high end, but well priced for good food."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The restaurant was really nice and modern, service was great, great selection of food and drinks... Better than most! Good was very reasonably priced. Get the egg rolls and the egg drop soup! Best I've ever had. I had no idea there was such good Chinese so close to me! I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! We were just passing through and decided to stop for a hot meal and did not regret it! Friendly staff and great food! The egg rolls are amazing and so is the Mor Wonton soup! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the most difficult for me to review because it is so quirky. The restaurant never looks clean and the set up is just kind of weird with customers seated very close to one another (even with plenty if open tables).   The customer service is great from one server who is usually the only one working, but pretty bad from everyone else.   As far as the food goes, I've only ever ordered the orange chicken here and it's not as at all. It's nothing special, but orange chicken is a pretty generic dish. The food comes very quickly and the lunch portion is huge for only $5.   I keep coming back because the orange chicken is quick and good, the location is convenient for me, and the price is good."}
{"text":"I mean, this isn't the best Chinese food place in the world but it certainly isn't the worst. I ordered food Saturday night - Orange chicken with chow mein noodles substituted instead of rice ($3 extra) as well as sesame chicken. The orange chicken had great flavor. The chow mein noodles were great, not too oily as they often are at restaurants. The sesame chicken was eh but WAY WAY WAY too salty. It didn't taste anything like sesame chicken that I was expecting, more so simply chicken smothered in soy sauce. Overall, with tip, it costed $28. We had leftovers for lunch the next day for 3 people.  It was an estimated 40-60 minutes for delivery and it came in 25 so that was definitely nice! Despite some of the reviews, I'd recommend trying this place out and deciding for yourself."}
{"text":"Let me say the food tasted and looked great. However, beware that they use MSG in their food. If you have no sensitivity to MSG, then enjoy. However immediately after eating the food both my mom and I had horrible headaches, dizziness, and some numbness in the tongue (all documented side effects of MSG). I'm disappointed as I really wanted to have a decent Asian place on this far North side of town, but I cannot handle their food. Also, the place really needs a thorough cleaning, I understand casual atmosphere, but food crusted on the wall next to you or stains on the booths are not \"casual\" they are dirty."}
{"text":"I think this is the worst Chinese food ever.  Thought I would try again after having a bad experience before, but it was just as bad.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I want to support my local establishments.  This was the first time I was there.  This is the saddest eating establishment.  The vinyl on the chairs were ripped.  The food was, how can I put it politely, Americanized so-called Asian-style, I-don't-know-what type of food.  It definitely wasn't American-Chinese food that I'm used to.  When I order tea in an American-Chinese restaurant, it should  be Jasmine tea that comes in a pot - not in individual coffee mugs accompanied by a lemon wedge as though it were Darjeeling.  But you know, the establishment was full of happy, satisfied customers.  I couldn't stomach the food.  Unfortunately, I won't be back there again until they update/fix their furniture, and actually serve American-Chinese food, not the bastardized weirdness they call \"Chinese\" food."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are a big hit with my brothers and me! Orange chicken and rice for only $6!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants! They have killer lunch specials, large dinner portions, and the food is always good.   The take out is perfect for a in home movie/date night, and they have NEVER messed up my order. It is to the point where we don't even need to look at the menu.  Wor Wonton Soup, Extra crab puffs, Sesame chicken, and Mango shrimp.  Even if you do not live in the area it is better then a chain restaurant found on every corner."}
{"text":"On my way home from work I snagged a red box DVD and ordered some take out from the Bamboo Cafe for a nice night at home with my fiancee.   The food was hot and ready for pick up when they said it would be (20 mins @ 6:30pm). The restaurant was not very clean and no one was at the front desk when I arrived.   The portions were good sized and they included a takeout box full of white rice as well as what I ordered. The food was ok, but a bit on the bland side. The chicken fried rice turned out to be the best.   Each entree was close to $10 and there were no fortune cookies in the bag!!!  I'll likely order from them again, due to their convenience, but for quality I might pick a different spot."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is awesome and the portions are big.  Crab puffs and chow mein is really good.  I give this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. I think we eat here about once per week. The staff is wonderful, it is clean and doesn't take too long for food. If you are hungry, order the dinner portions. They are HUGE and won't break your bank at all. Also try the Poke, I'm a huge fan! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi or Chinese(:"}
{"text":"Ok I eat here and the food is good and whatever. Let me tell you first off, I have a stomach of steel. But it seems like every time I come and eat here, I get the worst stomach cramps, filled with vomiting and diarrhea. I know they haven't had consistent ratings with health inspection and I can't help to wonder why.... This is the worst place"}
{"text":"We have been going here for years, service is fast and friendly food is great quality with large portions and affordable priced.  We have recently started getting delivery as well with the see quality"}
{"text":"Place is great for take out food if you're looking to pick something up.  You can often times find coupons for free meals and discounts in the Valu Clipper and the local circulars.  I've had maybe 5 different dishes here and the only problem I have is that they ALL taste the same.  Whether its supposed to be a bland noodle bowl or a spicy Kung Pao dish, they all taste the exact same.  Other than the lack of variety with taste, the restaurant is great to pick up food from.  Beware of an odor that goes through the airducts and wall from the buisness next door if you are dining in.  I've noticed the smell each of the three times I've eaten there and refuse to go back after the staff told me that it was from next door and they could not control it.  It is not an odor you want to dine with..."}
{"text":"Sesame chicken, white rice and soup for $4.99.    Chicken was awesome and very sweet.  Asked for some chili and hot mustard - both were HOT, yes!!!!  Wife and I had a nice lunch for $16.00.  Service was on point."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place because the food is not as overly-sweetened as most American Chinese places.  The sauces are lighter and tastier than most.  They have some REALLY great dishes like the Walnut Shrimp and Moo Goo Gai Pan.  We order for parties all the time and those get eaten immediately.  The portions are simply huge, and the quality is very good.    Dine-in service was friendly and fast.  Prices are decent.  Delivery is fast and friendly.  They say it will take 45 minutes and then show up in 30."}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight. Lady on the phone was very nice and repeated my order back to me. Food was ready quick, about 10min. It's a cute small restaurant with a few tvs. Prices are good and portions are large.   I got the orange chicken and crab puffs with white rice. The orange chicken was delicious. Crisp breading and sauce was yummy. Chicken was fresh and pure white meat. The crab puffs were also good and the rice was steaming hot and tasty.  Highly recommend. I will be back for more yummy food. Fresh delicious Chinese food. They even deliver in areas near by."}
{"text":"Egg Drop Soup and shrimp fried rice were just ok, probably won't go back for a while as I will check out other restaurants in the area. The price was very affordable"}
{"text":"Good, reliable delivery. Everything has been really good. We've been ordering from them for years. Best Orange Chicken I've ever had. Tip:  their \"chow mein\" is more like lo mein."}
{"text":"Great food, low prices. Very friendly staff and not a long wait at all.  Everything on the menu is good, you won't be disappointed and will have to deal with the pirates for the first time ever since she has been on water"}
{"text":"Had the wor wonton soup and Mongolian beef.   Soup was great and filled with lots of good stuff.   Beef dish was good but much more typical American/chinese cuisine"}
{"text":"trying to be an upscale restaurant, but NOT.  at 1st appearance as you walk in looks great, when we sat down chair upholstery was all torn up,  as I looked around to swap my chair I noticed they were all like that.   Tables were boxed frames with clear tops and there was crumbs under clear tops in boxes....Not very appealing.    Now for the food....we ordered pot stickers, they were frozen and tasted like little egg rolls; ordered the egg rolls that promised several kinds of meat and I found NO Meat in mine, full of very thin shredded cabbage was about all; ordered the Birds Nest..shrimp & scallops in a Potatoe nest (according to the menu).....very bland and nest not potatoes, it was chinese noodles deep fried; also ordered Spicy Thai Pan fried Noodles...Nasty, tasted like it was spoiled.  Told waiter about it and his comment was, \"it''s the fish sauce, and you either love it or you don't, I will take it off\".  So he took the dish away.  When we got our ticket dish was still on, he watched us from his station to see if we noticed, they were speeking in their language and then he brings a new ticket appolagizing he forgot to take off.....  The Only thing I would reccommend would be the Egg drop soup."}
{"text":"Lunch Special, Sunday - Friday 11-3. Only $5.25! I ordered the kung pao chicken with fried rice. The special comes with egg drop soup and two crab puffs. It was pretty tasty. Service was friendly and attentive. Will go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Oh so disappointed... Never have I had such bland Chinese food. The lettuce wraps had absolutely no flavor, even drenched with the extra sauce. I knew I was in trouble when I saw steak fries instead of potatoes in the chicken curry.  The curry didn't even taste like curry and had a sweet cinnamon taste. Needless to say, I won't be back. Such a disappointment considering they are a block from my home."}
{"text":"This place is very good! We came on a Sunday afternoon and were given the lunch menu specials which were 5.25 each which included the entree, rice, 2 wontons and egg drop soup. The portions were generous and very tasty. I was very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. The service was also very pleasant and fast. We will definitely be back! Thank you Bamboo Cafe for your service and affordability for the quantity and quality of food!!!"}
{"text":"Updating my original review. Gave me wrong takeout bag, went back and was upset with me because there were two to-go orders with the same name and they didn't bother to check?? Food was not good like it usually is. Not sure if management or chef changed."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh Chinese food! Try the pineapple seafood fried rice. Also the Orange chicken! Just yummy! Great to bring the family too or just a low key date. They have two TV's, really nice seating. It is pretty inside. The service is great! They accept card. The portions are huge! Great for sharing or not.. the food was much too good to share."}
{"text":"I tried this place one more time in hopes that it would be better than the first time and can't believe that it it has actually gotten worse. The prices aren't bad but that's because the food is awful. Yesterday's leftovers. There won't be a next time for me, I don't care at what price. Bad food and the staff is not very friendly either."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time tonight and asked what they would recommend.  Orange chicken is one of their most popular items...though the sauce was good the chicken was extremely dry.  The Kung Pao chicken had no flavor which I found quite odd and again the chicken was very dry.  The chow mein and fried rice were acceptable but nothing to right home about.  The only item we actually enjoyed were the crab puffs.  Called to complain and they were not interested in correcting the issue or even offering a partial refund.  We paid $55 for their very generous food portions but if they're not worth eating it is still money down the drain."}
{"text":"Ordered sesame chicken and beef and broccoli. Beef dish and sauce was awful no taste. Chicken was ok but no taste in sauce. Crab puffs were good. They only think they know how to cook. Won't be back. Panda is even better than this place."}
{"text":"Our first time here was not a a good experience, food was very salty had very little chicken in our chicken dishes and had to keep swatting away flies from our food. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Been in three times now.  First with Family, then two date nights.   Noodle are always fresh and amazing.  Service is OK.  A ton of food for the money and its really good.  Something is missing though on the atmosphere.  But we still like going."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in the vacinity, we have tried over half of the menu and are always pleased. The hot and sour soup is HOT and sour soup, it is good but you better like spice. This is the go to when lots of family is over and they deliver so all around great place."}
{"text":"Took me long enough to find a nearby Chinese food place up in Sonoran Mountain Ranch and I'm happy I found Bamboo cafe. Delivery is a plus and the food is always fresh and tasty. We usually get the shrimp and broccoli but we've also tried the Mongolian beef and it's just as good. definitely my go to local Chinese spot"}
{"text":"Been going here for years, food is good, reasonable prices especially lunch specials, place isn't the cleanest......    Very disappointed today though, we went in for lunch and the Male server suddenly became very irate with these four young females because they didnt leave a tip...Really, that's crazy especially making a scene while other customers are in the store..  A  few minutes later we watched as another customer came into the store and an older female worker started  discussing the issue with her stating that these four high school girls come in all the and do the same thing and never leave a tip...Not only is this unprofessional,  its uncalled for as the one Male server expressed his anger by banging things around the restaurant...Tips are expected ,I get it, but what if these young ladies are on a budget where some people are... We love the food at this restaurant but we wont be back....."}
{"text":"I live close by so figured I'd try this place. I actually tried two different times for lunch (hoping for the best the second time). It's awful.   The \"Sesame Chicken\" with \"fried rice\" was breaded chicken strips with a couple of sesame seeds and soy sauce on them. Same with the fried rice.   No way!"}
{"text":"This is great local Chinese food. Delivery is very fast. They get 4 stars because delivery is not always available."}
{"text":"We ordered from the Bamboo Cafe about 3 weeks ago (sorry for the late post) and we loved it. The food was delicious and delivered in a timely manner. We recently move to this area and will definitely make Bamboo Cafe our to go Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Well decided to try this place, and it's a small place in a shopping center kind of tucked away in the corner. It's not very fancy, pretty laid back type of a place. My son and I were seated rather quickly honestly it was pretty empty. I ordered a glass of water and my son a fountain drink. My glass was gross, didn't look clean at all but I guess water stains. The waiter came took our orders chicken and broccoli and orange chicken. Our food came rather quickly, actually seemed like they just warmed it up or something... The chicken was rubbery the flavor was just so so. I actually had an upset stomach all night... Service was just ok... Won't be back."}
{"text":"Place is not what it used to be! Dirty, run down & food is lacking any flavor but not bits of bone or gristle. Staff is nice, that's about it.   Tables had food stuck in glass tops, walls splattered with food or peeling wallpaper.   Got lettuce wraps and bit into what felt like a sandy clump, did not finish it & did not feel well after. Kids got beef and broccoli and meat was chewy and they didn't feel good afterwards either. So sorry it used to be our local Chinese go to!"}
{"text":"Great great crab puffs and lettuce wraps. I usually call in a to go or just show up and they are fast and we'll priced. They are so conveniently close to me also!"}
{"text":"I have lived near this area for over 10 years so I know this restaurant very well. We go there often and the owners are so nice and friendly!   They have the best lunch special and they make it very quick which is nice when you aren't wanting to stay too long.   You can't go wrong with any dish because they are all so good! My favorite dish is orange chicken and vegetable fried rice with chili paste on the side of course haha.  It's just great Chinese food."}
{"text":"We moved to the area a couple years ago and just haven't ordered Chinese takeout in a while. Tried this place about a month ago and were very happy. My son loved the Orange Chicken and I thought their Hot & Sour soup was really, really good! We will return:)"}
{"text":"My 12 yr old daughter had dinner here once before & she begged me to order delivery for her tonight. I ordered the Orange Chicken & Veg. Egg rolls for her & chicken fried rice for me.  Wow, within a short time we received the best Chinese food we've ever eaten. I even called Bethany, the most polite & sweet person, back after our dinner to thank her. Bethany even included a little treat for my daughter!    What absolute great food, outstanding customer service, quick delivery & an absolute 10+ for the entire experience!  We will never go any other place when we're in the mood for awesome Chinese food & fabulous customer service!  Outstanding!  Luv luv luv Bethany!  U made my daughter very happy tonight."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place!  Great portion size, very friendly service"}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly service, descent food, nothing extraordinary.  Overall it's average Chinese food.  I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Wanting to try new Chinese food locations. Got 2 egg rolls and orange chicken Also got 3 hours on the toilet $17 A truly inferior experience."}
{"text":"I love bamboo cafe! Their orange chicken is the best! My be loves their pork fried rice it's the only one he eats!"}
{"text":"Had them deliver and it was still hot!  Always great service and really yummy!!"}
{"text":"First time ordering food from here. Cody on the phone was very pleasant and repeated our order back to me. Took a little longer than the 10 minutes quoted on the phone but no problem. The food was great tasting and still hot when my husband arrived home with it (live 5 minutes away).  Portions were good sized; we will be able to get 2 meals from our dinner combos. Parking is limited but this is no fault of the restaurant. We will definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"For $5 lunch comes w not so tasty egg drop soup ..Food is fine &has large enough portions to satisfy. Nothing spectacularily delicious but not terrible..Cheap quick Chinese...reminds me of YIPS in Manhattan."}
{"text":"What business just randomly closes early? They could post that their hours are subject to change maybe? Then u could call before the entire group pours over the menu and calls with their order."}
{"text":"if i could give this place zero stars i would. i live super close and my hubby and i decided to try it based on the yelp reviews. the moment we walked in the ENTIRE restaurant wreaked of nail polish/nail polish remover/acetone. i tried stomach it thinking it would go away, but we sat at our table for about 1 minute before my husband and i both had headaches! so we got up and left. bamboo cafe is neighbors with a nail salon, so maybe a shared ventilation system? unfortunate for them and their customers."}
{"text":"This restaurant had quite a variety on their menu.  I have been pleased with the food each time I have eaten at the restaurant and ordered takeout.  I certainly recommend this place!  The service was also quick and the server was friendly.  He was very attentive  and brought our food very shortly after finishing our appetizers.    We sat on the side of the restaurant where one side was a booth type seat and the other side was a chair.  The booth type seat was very uncomfortable and made it difficult to reach the table.  Also, the table was a glass top with designs underneath.  Gnats and other miscellaneous flying creatures worked their way into the designs but could not find their way out.  A little gross while eating!   Still, great place to eat!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese places in the valley. Affordable, delicious and friendly atmosphere. Will be returning and bringing everyone I know. Also, can't beat their lunch $5.95 plus tax lunch specials that come with rice, soup and two crab puffs."}
{"text":"Ordered the Orange chicken and egg drop soup. Egg drop soup was pretty good but the orange chicken tasted kind of different. It's probably more of an opinion from my end but there are other places out there better than this place. Also the place is pretty dirty that's were really turned me off. The play is that they served my food odd came with dried food particles from previous orders :/ gross"}
{"text":"I love this place it's a restaurant that I will visit multiple times and never get sick of it, great service as always and the food is always amazing. Keep up the good work bamboo!"}
{"text":"Ordered a staple of chinese restaurants:  Kung Pao Chicken.  It is probably the most popular dish and on every menu in every chinese restaurant.  Like ordering pad thai at a thai restaurant.  It gives one an idea of the restaurant in general.  If a restaurant can't make such a common dish, I wouldn't have much hope for anything else.  It was bland and flavorless.  Mediocre selection of vegetables.  No hot peppers at all! In 30 years of eating that dish, this is the first time I've seen that.  Bleh!"}
{"text":"I usually order from this place but today was the last time. I ordered a shrimp and tofu soup and it did not have any shrimp.. just tofu..with eggdrop soup. I called back asking why my soup didnt have shrimp? I told her you gave me egg drop soup with tofu. Then she says let me ask the chef. She comes back and basically says this nonsense about why they are so stingy with the recipe and did not do anything to fix the order. All they did was tell me thats how the chef makes it deal with it. This is the description for the shrimp and tofu soup on their online menu. \"succulent shrimp, scallions, tofu and snow peas in seafood soup.\" This place can suck my succulent balls."}
{"text":"Went for a quick bite during lunch hour.  The prices specials are great.  All for 5.25!  Entre's included steamed rice, crab puffs, and soup.  I'm usually not a fan of crab puffs, but these are amazing tasty.  They have a sweetness to them that I like.  The portions are very good and for the price its worth coming again!"}
{"text":"I will just say to IGNORE the recent flood of one star reviews by idiots who have two or three reviews!!!! I am certain that they are family or friends of other restaurant owners in the area who trying trying to taint Bamboo Cafe's good reputation!! I never trust a poster who has two or three reviews, especially when they bash a place!!  This restaurant serves an AWESOME lunch for ONLY $5.25!!! I am just shocked at how much tender beef they put in their Mongolian Beef dish!! Only $5.25 for a combo lunch?? WOW!!!   The atmosphere is relaxing and actually kind of upscale for a Chinese strip mall restaurant, the food is good and the portions are big!! Their crab puffs are very good!! I usually pass crab puffs off to my hubby, but not when we are at Bamboo Cafe!! No way, Jose!!!  Look at ALL of the GOOD reviews!!! Yes, this place is good and their prices are cheap!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best in Peoria as we have tried most. The delivery person was really nice and prompt as well."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. You can't beat the price, and the food is very tasty.  For Chinese food it is pretty good.  I didn't like the place a few years ago when it tried to add sushi among other things.  Now with new owners and menu it seems to be just right.  I now go there once a week or so to enjoy the savory lunch."}
{"text":"The honey walnut shrimp is amazing!!!! We always order two of them along with the lemon chicken. Love this place! We eat here once a week."}
{"text":"Only ordered from here once, unfortunately won't be doing that again. The Spicy Thai noodles had WAY too much fish sauce. I could smell it across the table and it tasted terribly fishy. We also ordered the sweet and sour chicken. It ended up just looking like chicken katsu, and they only put the sauce on the side so you just poured it over your food. I was expecting it to be like stir fry in the sauce, (like the picture showed). The vegetables were hot but not cooked, if that makes sense. Like they were microwaved. Service was good but the food was just disappointing."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant ever! Food is great, delicious, always fresh, and comes super fast! People who gave this place less than 5 stars were expecting something else when they ordered, but they clearly were not paying attention - - the menu has very clear descriptions and pictures. They just had preconceived ideas about dishes, probably from going to Panda Express too much!  Service is always fantastic. Ken, the waiter, is always helpful, friendly, and efficient. The hostesses are also great. I appreciate that the owner hires young adults to give them a chance for a first job.  The restaurant itself is super cute with nice decor. There are a couple of TVs, great for when there's a lull in the conversation.  Recommendations: crab puffs, general tso's chicken, Thai spicy rice noodles, walnut shrimp, pineapple fried rice (or yang chow fried rice for everything except the pineapple)"}
{"text":"Great service at take out. They accept the 2 for 1 coupon for take out which i really appreciate.   To go entree always fill the container to the max.  Plenty of white rice always given.   Bok choy studio fresh and delicious.  Come here if you like great Chinese take out."}
{"text":"Lots of good Chinese food for a good price. Been here a long time and it's a staple for this area"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! The portion sizes are decent. Service is wonderful and the lunch special can't be beat!"}
