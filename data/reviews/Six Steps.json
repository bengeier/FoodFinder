{"text":"The atmosphere is very comfortable - it's dark and intimate, with gorgeous mirrors (in fact, don't sit in front of the mirrors if you can avoid it - it's odd to eat while constantly watching yourself out of the corner of your eye. Everytime your hand moves, your eyes dart to the mirror, and then of course you kind of watch yourself eat. Slightly off-putting.), segmented well for romantic dinners. The service is very good, although somewhat uppidy (2 bus-boys travelled in tandem, just in case one couldn't carry everything, there was always a shadow just behind). It's sexy and warm. The space is perhaps too segmented for a client event, but do-able in the end.

Food:

Now, I was eating to find meals for the masses, so these wouldn't necessarily be my normal choices, but here you have it:

Ceasar salad is accessible (moreso than the Roosevelt Room), but had those troublesome croutons that you can't pick up with your fork, giving you a pretty woman moment as they fly at your date whenever you try to stab one. 

Salmon gravlax was a little too thick and fishy for my fancy shmancy fish tastes, but not overall bad. The jam was too sweet, leaving no necessary tartness on the dish, and the bread was exactly the same as the pre-meal bread, which felt like kind of a jip.

The steak, a surprising entry (I didn't eat it), was in the words of my boyfriend \"the best meat of all of the restaurants I've been to with you\" ... not sure how to take that, but there you have it. So it's not the worst for sure. It was a better quality cut, that was cooked perfectly topped with not-overpowering gorgonzola. He ate every bite. And who cares about the veggies and pomme frites in attendance. I'm sure they were fine.

The halibut must have been butter poached - it had that melt-in-your-mouth, sit-in-your-stomach richness. It was perfectly cooked also. The veggies were slightly on the oily side, but the risotto cake on top was a nice, crispy patty. As much as I enjoyed it, unfortunately it was just too rich to finish. 

Dessert: I always wonder how long it takes to create all of these sauces for a few drops on a plate. Dessert is good, but definitely doesn't appear to be a specialty. Mini persimmons (let's call them fitzgibbons, because I can never remember their name and know they start with a 'ph' which is close enough) are prevalent in all restaurants I visited in November... kind of a Toronto restaurant commonality.

The chocolate mousse was complex and tangy, whereas the 'tart' tart isn't so tart - it rather tasted like oreos. 

... and I must stop wearing that top to dinner. the restaurant was warm and richer-than-life halibut wasn't digging the belt either. 

Wear layers, stay away from the mirrors, skip the belt, and share all plates, just in case you end up with a meal as sporadic as mine."}
{"text":"No, not very good at all.  Pretentious and the food is very, very average.  Give it a miss.  Too overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"We went last night with a group, and everyone was really impressed!

Food was absolutely delicious. Flatbread pizza with mushrooms was my fave of all the pizzas, but we also tried some meat versions that were good. A friend had a scallop app that was delicious, and followed with amazing cod. I had the steak with the gorgonzola cheese. The steak was cooked to perfection, and they had the perfect amount of cheese (not too much - that would overpower it).
Nice wine list, nothing too pricy, a lot of reasonably priced bottles under $50.

I was surprised this place wasn't busier. I guess it's tucked away on a side street, but it's a side street that could well be a \"Restaurant Row.\" with Colborne Lane and a few other places. Don't miss out on Six Steps.  We got great service and delicious food. I'll go back."}
