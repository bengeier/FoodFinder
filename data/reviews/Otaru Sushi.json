{"text":"This is our third time at Otaru and the service and food have been consistently excellent.  We ordered Miso Ramen which was piping hot and the broth was delicious.  Then we had yakitori, cucumber roll, asparagus roll, shiitake roll and spicy scallop roll which were just the right size and tasted great.  The meals also came with salad that has the best dressing.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! Rocks found in food!!! Very disappointed with my order. We ere told the order would arrive at 6:50pm, the order did not arrive until 7:40pm. The food that was supposed to be hot, shrimp, tempura, spring rolls, were all cold. The last bite of spring roll that we took before throwing it away had a rock in it! An actual rock! We called to let them know and got a very defensive response. We were very polite and asked for a refund as we were not satisfied. They told us we waited too long after the order was placed to request a refund (an hour). After arguing and actually driving back to the restaurant they gave us a partial refund of only the food that was supposed to be hot, and told us we ate too much of the food to refund the rest. Do not order from here, food was mediocre to begin with and with the rocks and poor attitude it is not worth it at all."}
{"text":"The layout is nice, clean, and spacious.  The service is friendly and attentive, even taking the time to help my friend's young son.  In fact, I would say the service was the highlight of he visit.  Now for the food: The strength here would be the cooked foods.  Not to say that the sushi is bad, I've just had better; and yes in Newmarket.  The tempura had a lovely batter that was light and crispy without being greasy.  The soft shell crab didn't have much of a crab flavour but it still managed to taste fresh if that makes any sense.  Tuna and beef tataki were very tasty: nice and cool inside and a good sear on the outside.  The hamachi collar wasn't totally cooked through and when we pointed it out, they were extremely apologetic.  We ordered one of the large platters of sushi and sashimi which came with a good assortment of fish. For the most part it was your standard pieces of fish but there was a torched something in the mix that was outstanding and I could have eaten my weight in it."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from them, the maki rolls had way too much sauce and the portions were small compared to the price. It was way too expensive for what they offered. I won't be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time, and it always has amazing food and service. If you're a sushi lover, I highly recommend this place. They are the only place around I can find with the bbq squid and it is perfect everytime. Its a MUST TRY !!"}
{"text":"Service was good sushi was not.... Paper thin slices of fish on top of huge overly warm rice makes for an unpleasant sushi experience... Maki rolls weren't good either.. Much better sushi place just steps away on Main st.."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place since it opened. I ordered the spicy maki set $13.50. (Spicy salmon, spicy tuna and spicy California roll)   The taste of the sushi was good. Good ratio of spicy sauce, salmon, and tempura bits.  The only downside is the fact that the rolls looked small. It was more like mini rolls than full sized rolls with a decent amount of rice and fish. I guess by getting 8 pieces of each roll, it makes up for the size?   The taste of the food is a 4 star but the size is a 3. I really want to give this place higher stars cause the service was lovely and the food tasted good. I just expected more from the sizing of the rolls.   Their lunch specials seem like a better deal - 2 rolls for 7.95 but I have a feeling the portions will be even smaller, given the price."}
{"text":"This place has the best service I have ever had from asian restaurant. During our meal (around 30 mins) the waitress came over to fill up our tea for 3 times and she even asked if we need more tea after we paid the bill.  The place is quiet and comfortable. I saw a random stranger came in to borrow washroom and she is welcomed with smiles.  Cons: food portion is small but taste not bad. The small portion actually filled our stomach cuz we ate it slowly."}
{"text":"Love their spicy ramen and takoyaki (fried sqiud balls) which are both amazingly delicious and many other items they have. Never ate in but ordered for delivery on the just eat app and they definitely do deliver on time. Probably dine there soon in the future."}
{"text":"yum Yum YUm YUM! I love their shio ramen and hand rolls. They've officially got me hook, which is not great for my bank account. But who cares when your getting heaven on a plate (or in a bowl) this restaurant will be around for a long time!"}
{"text":"I usually only come here for lunch, since I go for all you can eat sushi for dinner. The service is really good and it's always really peaceful and quiet.   I've only had their bento boxes and a few rolls. From what I've had, their bento boxes are pretty standard and aren't very special, but aren't bad at all. One of their rolls, which is in one of the pictures, is very pretty AND tastes amazing. They char the outside of the sushi roll which gives a unique taste to the sushi, which I enjoyed. Some people were complaining about the warm rice, but I got a roll that was supposed to be hot, so I must enjoy sushi with hot rice then.   Though, if you're getting takeout on main st, sushi jun is probably the place for you. Otaru Sushi is definitely more for sitting in the restaurant than takeout."}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in Newmarket!! I've been here over 10 times, the food is amazing, service is great and has a great cozy atmosphere. I would totally recommend the Natsu box with short rib (comes with 5 pieces assorted vegetable tempura, 1 piece crab tempura, 1 piece shrimp tempura, 4 pieces california roll, 4 pieces deep fried spring roll)."}
