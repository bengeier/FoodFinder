{"text":"Look for amazing things to come out of the kitchen in the next few months....  the new cook has finger licking good talent !!!"}
{"text":"You're typical neighborhood bar. Reasonable price food and drinks with activities like poker or karaoke that will have you coning back"}
{"text":"I love this bar! Great bartenders..Sarah is the best!  Zoey & Tony too! Everyone so friendly. . The food is GREAT! My favorite is the Saturday night Prime Rib for $12.99. It really is a great deal and so good! Terrific neighborhood bar! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"There is poker league that plays at this place something and it can be fun to sit in on a game for free. The poker player since pretty friendly. You can also bets on dogs/horse races as well. It was a bit surprising to see when I first visit it. I've never done it and am not even sure were to begin with betting on dogs. The drink prices are reasonable. I've had a chicken fries steak once and it was just okay. The meat was a bit dried.  There is an area for smokers but it fills like a zoo with the bars sometimes. They have an out door A/C unit that does help a lot when you sit outside during the summer."}
{"text":"Been coming here since 2004.......One of the best local bar/restaurants in Tempe or anywhere in the valley. Staff has been a stable and friendly part of their success over the years. As a former owner of five bars here and in SD, I know what I like in a place, and this is it. Leslie and Tony provide great food and drinks at Fair prices, and you have plenty of HD TV's to watch her your favorite sports teams. Lyle also does a fantastic job with the kareoke on certain nights! I highly recommend you stopping by here for a most enjoyable experience!!!  Chris N"}
{"text":"The service was slow, the food was cold. I felt like an outsider. However the bartender was very friendly and the prices were reasonable. Middle of the road grade for a middle of the road experience."}
{"text":"It's not a place I would go for the food but it's small place you can have some fun in. They have a poker game on Wednesday's and if you want to be a star for the night they have Karaoke on Wednesday,Thursday, Saturday and Sunday's. It's a relaxed atmosphere if you just want to go for a drink."}
{"text":"I appreciate the bartenders and all the waitstaff. The environment is fun, lots of sports, great music and enjoy hanging with friends from the neighborhood!..THE BEST TACO TUESDAY, EVER!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for their free poker tournaments. Everything is amazing. The service, the atmosphere, the food, and the drinks. I wish there was a pool table, but everything else makes up for that."}
{"text":"Not a bad little spot. Friendly service and food was ok. I ordered the \"hot\" wings with a side of the nuclear sauce. The wings were big and deep fried to a golden perfection, the way that I love. They were nice and crunchy but not burnt.  The \"hot\" wings were not hot at all, somewhat disappointing and it was very vinegary. The nuclear sauce was just a little hotter but much more of the vinegar taste. Off track betting available.  Would go back if I was in the neighborhood, but not a place I would go out of my way to get at.  They also have several TV's, which is good."}
{"text":"What a dive.  We went to Boston's one Saturday evening to experience the karaoke and have some cheap drinks.  The karaoke \"regulars\" were pissed when our group got up and had fun.  One \"regular\" even told the karaoke host that he was \"better than this\" as he pointed to us.    Stupid.  Don't go to Boston's to karaoke alone or with just one or two people.  We had fun because we were in a large group."}
{"text":"Pretty standard bar on the northwest side of Elliot and McClintock. Been here usually on Fridays - which seems to be the most happening night. Other nights are not as crowded - mostly regulars doing their favorite standards on karaoke. Karaoke is Wednesday through Sunday last I checked. There's also off track betting and a section of the room kinda dedicated to that at the northeast corner of the place. Southeast corner is the karaoke host booth and I've seen the same guy doing it on Fridays - he seemed to know most of the crowd and would even go running off to the smoking area outside the southwest corner to grab the next singer. Haven't tried the food here but we usually get here later in the night so we don't really even see many people eating here. If you're not a regular here you might get that interloper feeling - sometimes that's good, though. Sometimes you don't want everybody to know your name. As always, your mileage may vary. Plenty of parking because at night I think this is the only thing happening in this mall."}
{"text":"We were out looking last night for new place to go, and we came upon Boston sports bar. The place was pretty well packed at 9 PM, we really weren't sure what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. The waitstaff what top shelf, rarely did we have to look for them before they found us. Plenty of things to keep you busy, they were playing poker while karaoke was going. One nice added feature is they have off the track betting. Not that we're much gamblers on the horses but it's nice to be able to if you want. I would like to give you a report about the food, but I waited too late to order and the kitchen was closed. I'm going to make a return trip just to figure that part out. Friendly staff friendly place."}
{"text":"This karaoke person is the worst we have ever experienced!! The \"karaoke\" guy has no idea what he's doing nor does he care He literally gives u the mic and walks away to go sit at the bar to drink and have fun with his drunk buddies so if u happen to sing and he's at the bar, other customers have to tell him \"hey that songs over\" and then he will grab the mic and say \"give it up for so and so\"  Wow  Like if you need to hide behind being a karaoke host to make friends and meet girls then being a karaoke \"host\" isn't for you my friend  Worst karaoke host I've ever seen in my life I don't understand y the place keeps him there unless he is related or knows someone that owns or manages the place"}
{"text":"Great Bar!  Do not confuse with Bostons Gourmet Pizza.  Much different and better - excellent bar food, lots of quality TVs, satellite and a staff that gets them to all the events.  Lowest tab you are likely to find and good but fun trivia competition.  Try this place!"}
{"text":"boston's. dirty, dirty, dirty boston's.   the beer is flat, the decor is deteriorating before your eyes (literally saw a ceiling tile fall on someone.), and the offtrack betting is amazing and makes you feel even dirtier!  but this is a dive bar and you should have no standards when you walk in here. if you have standards all the time you should probably go hit up some glitzy, clean chain bar that serves those drinks with little umbrellas in them. this is dirty boston's.  they serve minipitchers during happy hour for around 3.50 depending on if you like domestic or you want to get fancy with an imported beer. service has always been friendly and actually pretty prompt. bathrooms are scary, but c'mon, didn't i tell you this was a dive bar? don't go looking for ambience, just come here if you'd like to get really drunk really fast. priorities."}
{"text":"I really like this bar, and I'll tell you why.   Their beer is cold,  the staff is nice and so far the food has been ok.   I recommend this place to anyone seeking a decent bar.  Plus they have off track betting. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yay!!! Huzzah! Best food of all possible food. Here is me extending my review so it's not under the word count"}
{"text":"Lots going on...loud music, lots of crazy lights with the karoke guy who sings terribly.  He is more concerned about his own singing more than anyone wanting to sing.Our waitress was awesome.  Very attentive. They also had Texas Holdem going on.   Good for a very young crowd."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time the other day to place a few bets. Okay looking local place. The dining tables were a bit different. Kind of Denny's feeling. Ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold. As it got busier, I could only see one bartender taking care of the whole place. She tried, but was obviously a bit overwhelmed. Decent wings. Definitely not a destination place. But overall okay."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service consistently sucks.  Wait staff likes to bullshit instead of doing their job"}
{"text":"OK, so it is drab - that it is.  But I the wait staff on my visit was the dumbest most clueless idiot I have ever seen - no exaggeration.  The drink oder was taken 3 times and the waitress got it wrong three times (it was only a two drink order) after requesting 3 times as to what happened with our wings, we finally got chicken strips and fries - after 50 minutes.  Run away -"}
{"text":"Boston bar in PHX!?  Had to check this out!  Was invited here by a friend telling me this place has been in existence since she's been breathing.  That's a long time - wink haha!   Needless, to say my first impression of the place was -- wow what a poop hole!  However, I've been to worst and I loved it!  I like dive bars, but this place was more sports and please smoke a cigarette bar.  Outdated television sets mixed with some flat screens.    They had your basic bar menu; burgers, wings, and salads.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries.  Nothing to wow about it except it is what I expected to be.  If you ask me I would stick with the drinks and that's about it.    They have karaoke during the evenings most every night.  Lots of country and older music I've never heard of and I consider myself pretty old!  Needless to say the singing can improve, but I'm not once to complain.  I appreciate people who have the courage to sing their hearts out in front of a crowd. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"1st: It's a Boston pride sports bar/grill/restaurant type place. Everything you want to know about Boston is hanging on the walls and playing on their TV's. I actually thought it was pretty cool.   2nd: The music they were playing was completely random, and sucky. I was trying to pinpoint the genre. I think I even said out loud, \"Are the artists they're playing all from Boston, because I'm not getting this music??\" It was mostly mid 90's alternative/contemporary. Not that cool for a sports bar, even though I knew every song that came on, but I'm not normal.   3rd: Nobody liked their food at my table, including me, and I rarely complain about pizza. Even bad pizza is okay pizza, but it really wasn't that great. Little Caesar's? I dunno.   4th: They do have great Happy Hour specials 7 days a week, 1/2 priced drinks and 5 dollar appetizers, and they've got that trivia night thing going for them.   5th: I hate it when the server automatically assumes a guy is paying for the meal, and gives the check to one of the guys at a table. I'm not some liberal-feminist-type, but yes, some girls do pay for meals out."}
{"text":"Being a certified sports bar aficionado, as well as a Buffalo wing addict, I had to try this place after my wife and I moved to Tempe.  Bottom line:  Food's really good, service, not so much.  Boston's is a run of the mill sports bar, very dark with enough TV screens to handle an NFL Sunday and more.  Which is good, because it's also an off track betting site.  The number of screens devoted to horse and dog racing at any given time far outnumbers the OTB patrons there, based on my several visits, but there's plenty of sports choices available.  The OTB area is a separate room within view of the main dining room and the bar.  As stated, it doesn't seem to get a lot of betting action, but that may just be a function of the time of day/night.  I'm not a gambler, so don't really care.  We found the food above average for a sports bar, actually.  As a wing freak (see above), my first order was the happy hour wings ($5.99, a real bargain).  These are HUGE compared to other places, and are available in a lot more flavors than one usually finds in this kind of restaurant.  I've had them several times and have never been disappointed.  My wife and I have also tried the burgers and fish and chips;  both were fine.    The problem with Boston's is spotty service.  If you're at the bar, you'll find the bartenders friendly, attentive, and efficient.  The same can't be said for the wait staff.  While I'm a pretty undemanding customer (I once worked in a restaurant and have a lot of empathy with waiters and waitresses),  I've waited for up to ten minutes to be even approached by a waitress for a drink order while sitting at one of the tables.  And this wasn't an isolated occurrence; one evening, after going through the aforementioned wait, it was generally 15-20 minutes between any contact with the waitress, who was busy chatting with other customers (this is, after all, a neighborhood bar, so I assume there's some familiarity between the wait staff and the clientele).    This type of  behavior isn't a rarity;  my wife and I once waited fifteen minutes to simply get our check  paid.    I can't speak for the \"karaoke crowd\", as I avoid karaoke like the Black Death,  and am out of any establishment as soon as the overweight iced tea drinkers start tuning up;)  While we really like Boston's food and sports bar amenities, we've decided to sit at the bar from now on.  I will say that at one happy hour, I was waited on by the manager, who was quite friendly and efficient.  This attitude needs to be imparted to the rest of the wait staff."}
{"text":"I liked the baked wings and the appetizers.  Good service for lunch."}
{"text":"Been there during the day and night and it's depressing.  Dark inside, I was the youngest one in there by far during the day and couldn't be less amused with how rude the local patrons are.  Can't talk to the bartender without being interrupted by someone at the bar and ease dropping on conversations.  The food is pretty gross, just a few edible things on the menu...won't be going back not enjoyable."}
{"text":"My friend, boyfriend and I decided to go for Ladies Night + Karaoke. Boyfriend was our designated driver for the evening, so why the hell not? You can't beat $2.50 drinks  (which were awesome . . . one thing this place got RIGHT!) and drunk singing with your girls. We THOUGHT it would be a good time . . .   So many things wrong with this place. It's as DIVE-y as it gets! But hey, like Vikram A. said . . . just look at the area.   The \"karaoke regulars\" were screaming all kinds of stuff at my friend and I like, \"OH EM GEEEEEEEEEEEEE I sing it better, bitch!\" or that we sucked. Classy . . . because your rendition of Katy Perry's \"E.T\" or whatever it's called was American Idol material  *eyeroll*   IT'S  KARAOKE, DON'T TAKE YOURSELF SO DAMN SERIOUSLY! But since we're playing that game: You suck at singing yourself. You're just a cheap knock-off of Katy Perry . . . I'll check you at the factory outlet, sweetheart. ;)   The bathrooms felt and looked like a scene out of Zombieland. When I walked into the stall I was waiting for someone/something to come under the door and stab me.  Also, our waitress (wish I remembered her name, the one with her bra hanging out) was pretty much screwing around the entire night with her friends. When she got off work, she tabbed us out (without us asking) and said, \"I have to leave now, but you can keep drinking 'til 2AM!\" Then proceeded to go drink and screw around with her friends more, just like she did while on the clock.   I think that ^ was the nail in the coffin. When you can't \"delight\" your customers in the service industry, expect them to vote with their feet.   If you're looking for an AWESOME Karaoke experience, try Darkhorse on Ray and Rural in Chandler. Great karaoke selection, friendlier clientele / staff, and less trashy for sure.  Note 6/17/2015: To the trolls sending me messages and \"compliments\" informing me that this is a dive bar: I'm well aware, honey. This just isn't my kind of dive. We all have our opinions ... Sorry you have nothing better to do with your \"Yelp-Time\"."}
{"text":"Consistently Horrible service at bar. Wait at least 10 min for stoner 'perm-haired' bartender to serve you.  His name is Tony. Worst bartender ever.   OTB is nice.  TVs suck.  Karoake is the worst of the worst singers in the valley.  Shuffleboard is nice."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar with pizzazz. Welcoming environment with a lively staff and patrons. Ask for Tasha, she's terrific."}
{"text":"My 2nd favorite bar ever outside of O'Malley's West(Chicago, RIP) Been coming here for about 4years now and will continue as long as I live in the area. Pretty much Cheers for Horse Players, most of the focus is on the OTB section at the back of the bar, but don't let that take away from the good time had all over. Good Prices and the food is really good also.  Huge fan of Prime Rib Saturday's! Happy Hour from 2-7pm and there are always specials throughout the week!  If you are boujee(old townies) you will hate this place, if you are just looking for a good time and some good drinks, this is your place!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for a friend's birthday recently.  Not sure if we would have come here otherwise.  Pretty standard dive kind of place.  We came on a Saturday night and it wasn't packed but busy enough.  It was karaoke night which is fine, not my thing but fun to watch.  We hung out for a couple hours with our friends.  I was surprised to see only one bartender working for a saturday night but she was trying her best to keep up with everyone.   We ended up eating the nachos supreme which weren't bad as far as bar food goes.  Overall, not a bad place but probably wouldn't go back voluntarily."}
{"text":"Fun neighborhood hangout with great karaoke on the weekends.  There are a lot of regulars so being a newcomer can be interesting comparatively to other places, but I try to stop in here once a week. The DJ, Laser the Legendary, is much more personable than most places where the DJ hides behind a computer all night. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Decent place to grab some food and drinks.  Located right next to Arizona World of Baseball.  Easily provided seating for a party of eight on a Thursday night.  Would recommend for anyone looking for a drink in this area of Tempe."}
{"text":"Service is okay, nothing too over the top. The atmosphere is a little dingy for my liking, but it's still a pretty fun place to hang out."}
