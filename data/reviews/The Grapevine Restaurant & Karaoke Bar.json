{"text":"Wandering around on Easter Sunday, not much was open, so we decided to get a margarita at the bar, where we met LACY. Lacy decided that it was okay to insult my partner early on, but we stayed and finished the drinks. She and the other staff were busy playing on their cell phones, leading me to believe there wasn't any management on duty. When we left, we left Lacy a quarter for a tip, worthy of her poor customer service skills. When departing, she made another rude comment towards me, that is when I requested to see the manager. She went on to say she was the manager. Then when I requested a contact number to her boss, she threatened to call the police and have me removed. I promptly left, but YELP is where LACY will receive her public debut. I hope the real management reads this as well as the public. I initially thought the rancid smell of the place radiated from the bathroom. No, the stench originates with the crappy bartender named LACY. The only reason i didnt rate this place with zero stars is because there isn't that option available. People, you've been warned!"}
{"text":"The last few times we have been here, we've sat upstairs at the bar.  Franco has always been our server so the last time we were there I asked him how long he had been working there - 35 years was the response.  Kudos Franco.

We have tried many items on the menu.  The food is mediocre, but satisfying and flavorful.  The lavosh is incredible.  Stay away from the cajun chicken quesadilla (very messy and only cheez and chix) and the buffalo wings scared me a bit (not a fan of pulling apart pieces of chicken).  I would recommend the veggie lavosh or the cajun lavosh.  We have had the fruit plate (LOTS of fruit - great for a hot summer day), and various sandwiches.  

The prices aren't too bad - the drinks are a little on the pricey side.  The other employees are generally friendly and helpful.  It's a great place for late night eats."}
{"text":"Worst karaoke experience ever!!!  45 min after we arrived my husband checked the karaoke list and  was 10 names back. After another 45 min had passed and we had watched the same people sing multiple times he went to go check the list again and was still the same spot in line, 10 spots back. When we complained to the waitress (since no manager was working) we were told that those singing multiple times had tipped $20-$30 and the KJ was catering to them. Total bullshit. We attend karaoke at local bars frequently and have never ran into a corrupt system like that. Needless to say, we will not be returning to the Grapevine."}
{"text":"Watch your money very closely when dealing with the barmaid at the Karaoke bar.... last night, wife and I went in for a drink. We ordered 2 drinks and I gave for a $50 bill. She brought me back a few pennies and nickels and said...those drinks really ate up that $20. I said I gave her $50, and she said....oh yea, that's right and gave me the rest of the change. 20 minutes later I ordered a drink for 2 of us, she gave the other person their bottle of beer, but nothing for me.... then took the money off the counter. I didn't notice right away because there were a few folks standing around shooting the breeze. I said to her, hey you didn't give me the drink I ordered, and and again she said, oh I am Sorry again.... and poured my drink, saying next one is on me....
Well we didn't have any more, and finished our drink, and got up to leave....she said, hey you. Owe me for another drink....very puzzled, as was the guy next to me, I said what for....she said the last drink I gave you. I said the so called drink on me never happened, and she said I was just kidding! Strangest thing is I never had this so called \"drink on me\" that she now says she was only \"kidding\" about. If a bar maid has such a poor memory and kids about your money, why would they trust her in the cookie jar....or is it part of her game to rip you off? 3 incidents in half an hour is just way to coincidental!
As it turned out, I paid her for the so called 3rd \"on her ' DRINK BECAUSE I didn't want to make a scene. $12 isn't enough to fight about. 
All I can say, is don't take anything for granted in the bar at night.
To bad, as my wife and I have eaten there before and liked it. I assure you, we will not go in there to spend our money again."}
{"text":"The food was good enough. The service was so slow I got irritated. I felt ignored by the hostess and waitress I will not be going back."}
{"text":"this place sucks.  i went on a friday and sat outside, as the people we were meeting are smokers,  i had to wave down a server, who had no enthusiasm, sense of urgency, character, or personality.  and instead of working she sat at a table near us and had her own smoke.  there are so many better places in old town than this hell hole."}

{"text":"This is my thrid return to Grapevine.  Visiting Scottsdale for business.  The main reason I patronize Grapevine is because of the outdoor seating/patio -  I really love it.  Meals I typicall order are at lunch, notably their french dip with cole slaw which is decent.  I had a new waitress who was a hit/miss but she was trying her best.  Reasonable prices.  Best time of the year to visit this area, sit and watch up on the patio tourists below checking out the shops.  They do have a full service bar here!"}
{"text":"Hmmm...what did I just stumble upon???

As I am walking into the Grapevine, I am invited by a gorgeous and cozy patio. Only the smokers are mingling there, due to the cold. Nice...I shall join them soon.

I enter and am all of a sudden in a small room, with two massive table things. Nothing but darkness and the sound of Elvis in the background. I was instantly confused. WTF is going on here?!?!

As I creep around the bar, I discover the backroom - packed with people of all sorts, an energetic DJ lady and various tunes blasting out of the karaoke machine that my grandmother most likely swayed her hips too. Shall I be scared or embrace it? I embrace it and feel oddly at home.

Since I don't have much of a singing voice, I opt for the other option: Liquor. I order the bloody mary, others order the margarita. Both were..meh. And pricy to be honest. The menu was huuuuge...talk about selection! The only thing missing from the menu, since it was all over the place, was Sushi. We order the chuck burger. Solid; as it should be for $7.50.

The BIGGEST negative, that left me with a horrible aura, was the bartender. No personality, rude, and just nothing I want to encounter again. This drug the star count down.

{"text":"Went with a group of friends on Saturday night.  Yes, there was a huge book of songs.  

It was my first time singing karaoke... which means I needed a lot of drinks in me.  They kept the martinis coming, but I can't tell you if they were good or not, because I was pretty drunk.  We ordered food too, but I was too excited to sing to eat any of it.  But it mostly disappeared, so it must of been okay. 

I put 4 songs on my piece of paper, but was only called on once in the 4 hours we were there.  They said there was a rotation, but others got to sing more than a few times and everyone in my group only got to sing once.  I felt like they were giving the 'regulars' more songs.  

Also, it was a Saturday night and the 'regulars' were all singing country songs and showtunes.  I was practicing all week, I wanted to SING!!!! And their slow songs were boring me.

So hopefully there are other options in the valley for Karaoke, it did feel pretty awesome singing and dancing on the stage, in a drunken stupor and I'd like to do it again sometime. 

If I end up here again, perhaps I will change my review, but I'll never go here again on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Last nite, the whole family and I got together and went to the grapevine. It was my first time, and I will say that the service started out slow. That irritated me at first, but as the night went on I realized that it was kind of refeshing not to be in a rush.

We ordered a few bottles of wine, and got a lavosh, sauteed chicken strips, and chili. The chili had a weird after taste to it, but the lavosh and the chicken strips were great! The lavosh was made with Dolfino cheese and Cajun chicken, which proved to be a great combination. I loved that the chicken was not dried out either :)

After eating, my family and I joined in on some karaoke that was already going on...and we had a great time! There appears to be a set of regulars, which makes for a lively crew."}
{"text":"The Grapevine is best known to locals as a karaoke bar. The inside seating is dark, dingy and out-of-date, but their upstairs open air patio is very cool with fired gas lantern lights and rooftop seating that overlooks Old Town Scottsdale - a beautiful patio to watch the sunset from.

The service the past few times we have gone is poor. It was dead and staff could see us yet we were completely ignored on the patio for literally 15 minutes before I had to go ask the bartender to send a server over. 

The beer is cold, they have a decent selection of beverages at the bar. The food is average - highlights include Rays double-fried wings (super crispy but under-seasoned and lacking flavor), and their lahvosh - of which they have close to a dozen options. The menu is absolutely huge which is perhaps why their food is just ok. 

The low review here is given because of their service issues, indoor dining atmosphere being drab, and the average food. Definitely recommend the upstairs patio though for drinks at sunset and in the evening! Cheers."}
{"text":"I will not return to The Grapevine.  We went on a fairly busy Sunday afternoon and the staff was not up to the challenge.  The hostess disappeared for several minutes at a time, leaving many people wondering who to speak to, what to do, or whether they should seat themselves.  When we did get seated, the waitress was even more clueless.  She didn't show up for several minutes, then took a drink order and disappeared indefinitely.  Every time she did anything she was gone for an inordinate amount of time before returning.  This became especially annoying when she gave each of our party of three drink refills one at a time. When the food finally arrived, it was no longer warm, so whatever she had been doing she allowed our food to sit for awhile before she brought it.  Bottom line: the staff had no idea what they were doing and were extremely slow in doing anything.  I now see that this slow service runs through all the Yelp reviews.  Now the food: not horrible, but below average.  Definitely not worth the wait.  The menu spans lavosh, mexican, burgers and gyros.  Too broad a choice for most chefs, and this one was no different.  The chips and salsa were good, and the chips homemade, but that was the extent of it. The rest of the food was very mediocre and room temperature.  There are many good places in the Old Town Scottsdale area, and The Grapevine just doesn't measure up.  You can get better service and better food at many other places in that area.  (As a trivial aside, an example of how clueless the staff was is that on a Sunday afternoon, they had the bar TVs on bowling.  Yes, Bowling!!)"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Great place to karaoke.  All age groups go there and they also have great food.  Lot's of memories made here..."}
{"text":"We went there for Valentine's Day and unfortunately the whole thing was a mess.  We didn't have a server acknowledge us for about 15 minutes.  Once she did, it took another 15 or so minutes to get chips and salsa.  It was then another lengthy wait to bet our food.  Unfortunately, the meal I ordered (taco salad) was underwhelming and generic, so it didn't make up for the service.

Maybe they were not prepared to be busy, but I would have appreciated a more attentive server and better food."}
{"text":"Went here last night for karaoke. Horrible! Very small area that they use for karaoke, extremely crowded and uncomfortable people to space ratio. DJ would start playing songs before singers would get to the microphone. No stage area due to size. Some would stand in front of DJ and most would just sing where they were standing or sitting. This eliminated the 'performance' aspect of karaoke. They do not have a large selection of music either. I gave the DJ 3 songs for me to sing that almost anywhere else has and they struck out on all 3. Really???? When I got there I asked how long is the wait and the DJ said, \"20 minutes.\" Well an hour and fifteen minutes later he called me up. Ridiculous!! The sound and microphone quality was also poor. Bottom line I would never go here again!!!! And their website says, \"Arizona's Karaoke Place.\"  How depressing, poor representation of the state."}
{"text":"Pretty cool upstairs patio. However service was slow.. drinks took too long and both food orders were completely wrong.. one server for the whole upstairs. Also when walking in, we heard a guest who was leaving make a complaint about the service as well."}
{"text":"Dive bar at Scottsdale prices; be prepared to spend $6-$9 per drink, mostly ice.

My experience here was so disappointing. Walking in it feels like a cozy bar, and my friends and I were immediately drawn to the karaoke.

I arrived at 9:30 PM and put in my songs within a half hour. As I write this review it's 1:41 in the morning and I've yet to sing a single song.  I repeat: I've been here +4 hours without a single tune to sing. And most of the bar has already cleared out.  Apparently the DJ doesn't call people in chronological order, but rather based on what he's \"feeling\" at the moment. And apparently my song is too contentious and edgy and non-crowd pleasing to make the mix. I can understand though; apparently Will Smith is just too obscure for him. 

This isn't an exaggeration: anything post-dating the early 90's will not be called.

I'm assuming this is because the DJ's an older gentleman that likes to sing along - he literally has a mic and will sing your song, sometimes over you - and doesn't know the more contemporary hits. Oftentimes he'll shy away to older stuff like \"Sweet Caroline\" and \"Piano Man,\" so if that's your taste then maybe you'll find the atmosphere more compatible. But if you're a fan of music as edgy as Bruno Mars (I know, suuuper edgy) then know this going in: no matter how long you wait, no matter how much you tip, this man will not play your song if he doesn't like it.

You will be better served to ask the DJ what he wants to hear next than request what you like to sing.

Also, watch your drinks. Not (just) because of potential drugging, but because the cocktail waitresses will actually snatch them away from you to clear your table, regardless of how full they are. Even if you're sitting right in front of them, available for them to ask, forcing you to buy another drink.

All in all a very disappointing karaoke venue and unfortunately falls far short of recommendation.

If you're looking for a good karaoke bar, I recommend looking elsewhere."}

{"text":"This place is the bomb for upstairs cocktails at sunset. Food is very Cisco but reasonable prices. 
Don't go if you're a pampered princess....You may have to call a waiter. So what? Oh yeah, you're a princess. Get real, have fun go with an open heart & mind & you'll have a great time. Or if you're a princess, just stay home."}

The service is great and always fun--tiffany is super efficient, makes a great drink and always friendly and very welcoming. Brie is another one of my favorites. She is so sweet and always on top of her game. And there is Franko--oh my god --he has been there for ever --he is like a icon to the grapevine. I love the flatbread and order it often--you can't miss on it !! The salads are super fresh and yummy. I occasionally order a sandwich or a burger and haven't had a one I don't like yet. It's a fun and lively place to hang and enjoy an afternoon on the deck. Be sure to stop there for a fun and entertaining meal . You won't regret it !!!!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon we happened to run into my in-laws in old town, so we decided to find a place to sit down and grab drinks and possibly appetizers.  When we walked in the hostess was hesitant on seating us on the roof if we weren't going to eat. We said we weren't sure yet. It wasn't like it was full - there was perhaps 2 tables seated up there. So she finally sat us up there and we might have ordered food except service was so slow.  I don't think we'll return."}
{"text":"I was going to go to Cafe Carumba for breakfast or brunch the other Sunday, but I didn't arrive until 3:00pm and Carumba was closing.  I was disappointed, but it is great that they close early, so their staff can enjoy the Sunday afternoon off!  So I ended up going over to the Grapevine just next door. I have always seen it, but never gone there.  They have quite a menu with everything from Gyros to steak sandwiches.  I normally stay away from places with such broad cuisine. They tend to not be very good.  But, I have to say the service was great. Our waitress was so very pleasant, and the steak sandwich on garlic toast I ordered came with a great cut of steak, and a homemade garlic roll that it was served on.  They even made a killer cosmo to top off my Carrie Bradshaw breakfast.  I would come back here again.  It was a very good experience."}
{"text":"I was on vacation and wanted to look for a place that had a decent fish sandwich (I had a craving...sue me!). I looked on several sites and they all stated that this place had a \"catfish sandwich to die for\". Hmm, we'll see about that. Since this was close to the place I was staying, I decided to give this pace a visit for lunch.

Thankfully, I stopped by during an early lunch hour and there wasn't too much of a crowd. Seated myself in the outdoor patio. I knew what to order so I gave that info to the waitress. 

The sandwich did live up to its name. It wasn't too flaky; nice texture and I liked the ciabatta roll that came with it. The slaw and salad that came with it were pretty standard but I didn't expect too much. 

Service was excellent, time to table was great. Didn't experience the full ambiance but nevertheless I was satisfied with my experience. Will come back the next time I fly out here!"}
{"text":"Sound issues, some obvious regulars less than welcomming, some there having fun but I was underwhelmed."}

The geriatric running the show runs a tight a rotation of TERRIBLE local singers who all sing terrible country songs.  the food at this place sucks, their bartenders suck.  And the karaoke is terrible.  I bet you could find a better spot."}

{"text":"A karaoke bar on a Saturday night?! Get outta here! This place rocked. A little too packed though. The best way to describe the floor plan for this place is it's like an hour glass. It gets congested in the middle (where the bar starts and the drink prices are kinda pricey) so if you're trying to get from the front to the back, where all the action is, be a little patient; good things come to those who wait. There's also a nice patio for those people looking to get some fresh air or take a break from all the action. The karaoke host doesn't quite stick to the order in which your song request is submitted (some people sang twice before I got my ONE chance). All in all, it was a fun spot and most of the people there were cool; not what I had expected based on previous experiences I've had in that area. THUMBS UP FOR THAT! Oh yah, I also got to meet some fellow Yelpers there too who, which was the cherry on top! I'll definitely be found there again messing up more songs for public entertainment. nAcHo: Coming soon to a karaoke bar near you!!! 

***Da Bafroom: 4 stars for the bafroom! WOO HOO!!! A delightful aroma streamed throughout this miniature suite adding to the already pleasant experience I was having. The interior design/decoration was up-to-date with tiled walls, 2 fancy new urinals and one bathroom stall for those looking to participate in \"floor mounted porcelain activities\". Bathroom soap was definitely Dial (TM) or an imitation Dial Liquid Soap which, for this place and it's location, I would have expected something more fancy and better smelling like Body Works soap or Bed Bath and Beyond stuff. OH, who am I now??? I'm nAcHo, the Yelp Bafroom Extraordinaire, that's who! Sorry, (compose yourself, compose yourself...) I guess I felt a little spoiled being in sucha nice restroom..."}
{"text":"From bad to worse...  
The waitress recommended the jumbo shrimp, I knowing there are no oceans near Scottsdale) decided to try it anyway.  The shrimp was so bland and over cooked I couldn't eat it, I ended up getting a fruit plate instead.  What made me mad was when the waitress (the same one) asked us how our food was and we told her about the shrimp, she said \"yeah, a lot of people said that\".  I normally don't take things out on the wait staff but she full knowledge that the shrimp was awful but recommended it anyway, I hope she puts that $1 tip to good use...

As for the atmosphere...

the sun was going down when we got there causing the temperature to drop so we asked the waitress to please turn the outside fans off.  the fans were fitted with a water mister that sprayed a light mist if water .  Now we are no longer getting blasted by the fans but are getting hosed down with water.  I had ask three times before someone shut off the mister.   I was fairly wet before I ever saw my food."}
{"text":"RIDICULOUSLY SLOW SERVICE, but decent food + nice staff (saved it from 1star). e were 4 adults, 3 kids, 1 infant. We ordered SIMPLE food (wings, nachos, chx tenders) after a 20+min wait (cool with that) we sat for nearly an hour to be served. Blah. It wasn't that busy. Nothing was comped. Margarita's were average (served in pint glass with a straw :( ). Unacceptable even for a former restaurant worker of many yrs & a chill NW resident. Find someplace else to eat, the 2nd floor outdoor patio wasn't worth it."}

{"text":"It's a fun environment and they have a great selection for karaoke. The only two things I would recommend is going early because they get packed and it's hard to find a spot to sit enjoy. And also, I think you have to really be drink towards the later part of the night to understand and enjoy some of the crazy drunks. We saw two men get kicked out because they lit their cigarettes INDOOR! And they were locals-- how do you do that? Lol"}
{"text":"The Grape Vine is one of the best venues in AZ to catch a Nathan S. show and believe me everyone should experience a Nathan S. show at some point in their lives. He is as talented and energetic a performer as the world has ever seen.

I don't know what else goes on in this establishment but I do know that the karaoke here is tits or bitchin or whatever Scottsdale language is these days for neat-o. The song selection is fantastic, the crowd is awesome and most importantly they have a stage! I am a little bit of a performance god (see ham) and love a good karaoke stage. Watch me people, envy me, let me get you off! I am a golden God!!!

Ahem...The patio is awesome and large. The drinks could stand to be cheaper for this type of bar but I guess when you drop it in the neighborhood that it is dropped in you have to do as the Romans (See vomitorium).

P.S. I am hungover and haven't a goddamned clue what most of this review means."}
{"text":"You would think a place with this name would have a great wine list.  But No!  Lower end wines and not many options."}
{"text":"Five star convenient location and nice upstairs patio. 

This place was so in need of a deep clean. It was seriously dirty from the menus, the floor to the tables. I felt dirty just eating there. Also because its a patio people were smoking all around us, which is good to know if you are eating here. Not a big deal to me, but it could bother some people. 

Not sure if its cause Spring Training was going on so they were busier, but the whole experience was really slow. When we did get the food the serving sizes could not have been bigger! Good to know when you are ordering, since we didn't and had about 1/2 the food left over after we ate. 

I would only come back here to drink or be in the sun on the convenient patio area."}
{"text":"Meal tasted like elementary school food. Horrible but service was okay. I should have known when a place offers every type of food it usually is horrible."}
{"text":"This place is such a dive that it's awesome. I was in town with some coworkers for a summit and whenever we get together someone always mentions karaoke. Looking on the Yelp app for nearby bars or places to find such an activity, The Grapevine was at the top of our list.

Sure, it's not a well lit, clean or fancy bar in any way. And service is a bit slow, yet friendly. But the atmosphere, the clientele and the karaoke host  were absolutely bad ass. The crowd was a mix of people above 50 and people around 25-30. So every other song was unfamiliar to half of the bar and every other song was either terrible (in a good way) or totally awesome. 

I had an absolute blast. While dive bars and karaoke are not typically my style, if I find myself back in Scottsdale for another work function, I certainly won't turn down a chance to come back to The Grapevine. A-OK in my book!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday.  No karaoke was going on, so there was NO REASON to come here!  The service was absolutely terrible.  We spent over 90 minutes, most of it waiting for service, the bill, and for the waitress to pick up the bill.  I gave up on using a credit card and used cash instead so we could get out of there!.  I had a bowl of chili, my wife had a salad and Mom had soup and a wrap.  Although the food was not terrible, it was nothing special and, combined with the lousy service, we were very disappointed.  UNLESS YOU WANT TO DO KARAOKE AT NIGHT, DO NOT EAT HERE."}

only one waitress really does her job.the bartender and the rest of the wait staff take forever to serve your order and continuously chatter among themselves! the male bartender always looks sad and NEVER smiles and needs to work elsewhere like in a funeral parlor. 
food selection is extremely LIMITED! they need to add more items on their menu.

limited parking.limited seats. lots of yakking by all of the wait staff except for the waitress wearing glasses as she is the only one doing her job!

bathrooms are a mess. real classic untidiness bordering on filth. the waitress wearing glasses and the karaoke on the nights i mentioned are the only thing that could keep this business afloat."}

Long wait to get a turn but a great crowd to hang out in so it wasn't so bad. Great service from the bar! I couldn't believe how cheap beer is here. My fiancé got 4 craft bottles for about the same price as one pint in Seattle! Can't comment on the food because we didn't have any. We stayed right until bar close which neither of us have done in probably 10 years. If you're looking for a fun karaoke setting while visiting Town this is it!"}

We didn't subject the poor people to our voices but those who chose to partake created a great atmosphere for us lurkers.

The drinks were made well and my glass was never left empty. The crowd was a total mixed bag and all very friendly. We will definitely be heading back."}
{"text":"The bartender, lacey was super nice. She was funny and have lots of good suggestions. The mai tai was so good. It was worth every dollar and Instagram/Snapchat worth. The piña colada was delivious. You can't even taste the alcohol, but then I had a few drinks before hand. It was perfect from what I remember. Pretty chill place. The patio wasn't pack.

Not expecting to monopolize the kareoke but with the price of the drinks.. After happy hour.. They draw you in and don't expect to get your request in.  Kareoke is the lure... Don't get to excited.

* Slow drink service.
* Kick ass bongo drums.

Sat upstairs in patio, group of older women directly next us started smoking - not cool -Plus it is just too tight of an outdoor/upstairs dining patio to allow smoking. 

Ya not impressed, many other places in same location w/ better ambiance."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd stop of the night on our quest to find a great dive bar to hang out in Old Town. Hey, we were walking, and it was right around he corner from J. Chew.

When we went in we could hear the beautiful sounds of karaoke. We went back into the bar area, and it was packed. There literally was not one open seat, and standing is not much of an option. There was so much estrogen in the room, I felt a little woozy.

So even though it seemed like all the broads in here were having fun, we weren't here to karaoke, so we bailed immediately.

On to the next possibly fabulous dive...."}
{"text":"It was ok . Service was so slow even though our waitress  was hustling.  Something made me not feel well after I ate .I had the burger.   I judge I restarunt by their bathroom.  If i would have gone to the bathroom first I would not have eaten here"}
{"text":"I came here late night at about 1am and karaoke was in full swing. I can't comment on the food as I didn't have it and I can barely comment on the drinks. Also, I'm not really a karaoke kind of guy - not singing, not participating, or even watching. It... just isn't really my thing. With that said, I sat in the front part right when you walk in the door. Not too rowdy in that area, you can still hear the karaoke, but not really a part of it either.

In general, I kind of liked it. Goofy. A slightly older crowd (30s was average age I'd say) unlike some places late night in Scottsdale (20s average age). The bartender came over relatively quick even though we weren't AT her bar, which was nice since we could have easily been overlooked.

Kind of hard for me to judge such a place since such places aren't my norm. :)"}
{"text":"Staff was nice, food was good. Just not a fan of the smoking section, you can smell the smoke all over the restaurant. Sorry I know it a personal preference.  Will not go back because of the smoke. I didn't know you could still smoke in restaurants. I did sit in the non-smoking section."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, less than what we expected though. We dined late on a Thursday after the art walk on the patio, which was great for people watching. Karaoke was a lot of fun! Lots of drunk college students made for an interesting night. Found a drunk girl's phone, had a run in with a frat guy and was flashed by an older woman, all in the woman's bathroom. My kinda place."}
{"text":"WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!
I really wanted to be positive. So I will start with the best parts and work down.  However, this place was a waste of money and time overall. 
1. Hostess was super attentive, more-so than anyone else, even the waitress. Sat on patio upstairs and nobody said a word to us for over a half hour. Hostess finally checked on us and horrified to hear no one talked to us, sat us in another section with another waitress/server. 
Tipped her $0 (my biggest mistake)

2. Our now server was attentive and mostly on her game and mostly friendly. 
Tipped her $10 on card $10 cash

3. Drinks are decent priced and bartender seemed on his game.
Tipped him $5 for 2 drinks

4. Food was above average to good. Not remarkable.

5. Karaoke host was the worst part. He has no idea how to work a sound system and plays harmonica louder than the singers. Very crude. But the volume was reasonable at the beginning. We signed up before dinner. The host and I worked out that it was approximately a 45 minute wait. We waited another hour past that and he still didn't get to me. When I talked to him, he shuffled through his slips to find my name buried another hour or more away. He said, \"I'm not sure how that happened! I'll get you right up.\" I said it was fine and we waited another half hour and finally walked out because the music got so loud and so distorted that it was absolutely painful to tolerate. No matter how good/bad singer was, there was no enjoyment to be had. 
Tipped him $5 for what service? Not that I should get bumped up for tips. But at least keep me where I know I was. 
About $100 to Grapevine later, I am home in bed and I enjoy a tuna sandwich on the dusty job site more than I enjoyed this place. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!
WE LOVED THE HOSTESS!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to the upstairs bar. Our server Lacey, was great. Fun, interactive and made a great margarita. So good the rest of our party ditched the beer and wine. We got a pitcher. 
Thanks for a great evening."}
{"text":"Does anyone remember Don Henley's 1984 hit 'Sunset Grill'?  That is the best way I can describe patio experiences at The Grapevine, in positive context.  The menu is standard, excellent.  However, the true magic of this Old Town stop is the second floor.  The greatest jewels for ambiance rest in the tables directly at the tops of the dual staircases.  They afford the perfect view of the streetscape and people watching, with a nice meal and drink afforded.  If you bore of the same status-seeking experience at the run-of-the-mill restaurant, venture over to the Grapevine for a thrill!"}
{"text":"The grapevine has a WONDERFUL patio that gives a glimpse of the mountains, Old Town Scottsdale and the stars (at night, of course!). The service was okay--the hostess didn't quite make things clear about what was happening.

The food was also okay. I had the taco salad (the chicken was wonderfully spicy, but the salad could have had more variety in it). My parents split the ribs, which they said were good, but didn't seem to have a deep flavor to them."}
{"text":"It was not bad i would say. I went there for a karaoke, i enjoyed it. However I would have preferred if they had more recent songs. Food was not so good as well."}
{"text":"It was during the day (4pm) on a Thursday and the place was pretty dead which i get for that time and day. Titos and soda was 10.50 but since i paid cash it was 9.50, overpriced maybe. Big glass and pour though. Definitely a big locals place. Saved seats at the bar for specific locals. Friendly staff, didn't eat. I will be back for night karaoke."}
{"text":"So much fun singing after a day of drinking! Their cocktails are super good from what I remember and their food was really good! Make sure to have a sober driver or you may not sing here till after you are out of the slammer."}
{"text":"I was out of town on a Wednesday night and heard through the grapevine (sorry, i had to) that The Grapevine was a great place for Karaoke. It was, IMO, OK. 

The Bads: The songs are rather old. Not a problem because I'm a Karaoke geek and have a flash drive with new stuff on it. They can't use a flash drive. You have to bring a CD!?!? Who carries those? The singers were a balanced mix of singers, non-singers, and drunks trying to mumble something on the mic. If you want to pop out a song or two and you don't know someone there, you may get passed up in the rotation, on occasion. The sound system was outdated and scratchy. 

The Good: You can sing starting at 5. Thats good if you want to hit it right after work. The server, Sarah (I believe), was cool. She brought us plenty of drinks. That's probably  because our party of 4 was hitting the Fireball and Crown like they were the last 2 bottles on earth. The pours were heavy, too, which is great for us, but probably hurts their bottom line. The pour may take me back of I'm in the area, so it could be good in the long run.  

All in all, I would give them a 3.5 if I could, but would label it a dive bar you can get drunk at and sing a song as an afterthought,  not the other way around. 

See my review on Ernie's, as well. It's about 15 minutes away from the Grapevine,  and worth the drive because of the awesome food,  excellent selection of songs and sound system, and real singers."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of Eliters after Thursdays OYE.. what better way to get to know a new group of people than through Karaoke? You find out whose shy, whose got shitty taste in music, whose heart is broken, whose the attention whore, and whose that fucking guy in the corner anyway? 

We were all previously sauced up, so why stop now? You have to be saucy for Karaoke. Drinks all around. We were also all full.. so no one ate anything, so I have no idea what the food is like, but apparently its good shit.

All I can say is that there was a rockin' selection of tunes to choose from, an eclectic mix of people, adequate seating, full bar, and BONGOS. Fyes. I can assure you I made an ass out of myself, multiple times, but hey.. I had a damn good time doing it. Totally recommend this spot for you to do the same."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I from SoCal stumbled across this nice lunch eatery while in town for a wedding. Known for its cajun chicken and pizza served on crackers as opposed to dough and pasta sauce. We got the cajun strip sandwich and the original pizza. Both were very delicious!! Service was great too!! We had just returned from a hike and our server refilled our drinks at least 4 times without us asking. Seats on the patio allows you to take in the wonderful Old Town Scottsdale and warm weather."}
{"text":"I would now like to write another review for the grapevine, and this applies only to the grapevine when I'm singing George Michael's I Want Your Sex. One billion stars."}
{"text":"Had the urge late one Friday night to do karaoke.  A local recommended the Grapevine to us.  It's a small bar and was VERY loud.  I don't mind loud spots most of the time, but all the \"Dilly Dilly\" bros were pushing my limits.  

Now it does have a fun atmosphere as everyone singing along and cheering the person that just sang.  I picked a song as soon as we got there.  It well over an hour and I was still waiting to sing my song.  I wasn't too concerned as it was a different person each time, but then shortly after there were people singing for the second and third time before I got to go up.  

Sure, yeah people like to see the cute young girl and tight black dress, but give everyone a chance to have fun and sing...this is not American Idol.  

Maybe I made the mistake of not tipping the DJ.  I don't feel that I should pay to sing."}
{"text":"I knew our karaoke night was going sideways when the bearded KJ called the guys in our party up to the stage to sing a song that he had thoughtfully selected for us. It was Short Dick Man by Salt n' Peppa. Not only did we sing the song, but as we were singing the KJ went to town on his harmonica, playing along and jamming out throughout the whole song. 

It was surreal. 

Even more surreal than the scene itself - a collection of older folks singing country and standards, dive-bar drinks and atmosphere, and some bongos in the corner. And stiff, not all that cheap drinks. 

Needless to say, the more drinks you have, the more fun you'll have here."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open for many years. Unfortunately, it looks like it. They need a serious clean up.  The restroom was a mess. Maybe I hit it on a bad day. An example.....I used the restroom, an employee was in there as well. There was water all over the counter and paper towels covering the floor and the trash was was piled high. She washed her hands, put on lipstick and walked out. She clearly showed no concern. Really? Wow! 
The gal that waited on our table was not very friendly, seemed uninterested, especially when we didn't order alcohol and never once asked how our food was nor thanked us for coming in. My boyfriend hardly ate anything of what he ordered and she pulled the plate never asking how it was or if there was a problem.The food he ordered was unimpressive, cold (should have been warm) and not very good. I ordered the hummus, two flavors, and it was good. Not great especially for homemade, but not bad. We would have said something to the manager, but it seemed hardly worth it. A Yelp review will hopefully catch some attention.
It's a really cool setting and I love the patio option upstairs.  Great view.  Too bad it was a bad experience. I was here several years ago and it was much better."}
{"text":"It was 115 degrees out and this was the second restaurant we passed at lunchtime that had misters on their patio so we went in. Portions were gigantic and yet somehow we were able to finish off the ceasar salad and french dip. Service was snappy though a little plastic the way they all smiled the same at us. 

I'd say this place serves some decent grub but they can't make up their mind what kind of restaurant to be. The middle panel of the menu boasts middle eastern lavosh while the right panel advertises Italian and the left panel offers typical sandwiches with a quesadilla thrown in for a twist. It's definitely not a destination restaurant more the kind of place you need when it's scorching outside and you're dying of hunger and thirst...okay, it's not that bad, but why go unless you just happen to stumble into it on your way to someplace else and if that's the case, you wouldn't be reading this review."}
{"text":"The main attraction at The Grapevine is their old skool, no frills karaoke bar. No private rooms or bottle service, what you see trending today. It's one stage, two screens, a piano player - who also whips out the harmonica - and tunes. 

I rec a weeknight visit when all the neighborhood locals take over the bar. We were told weekends the place is packed and can get a bit fratty. 

Drinks are cheap. Service is fast and they have a very clean ladies room!"}
{"text":"Food is decent and this is a great place for karaoke with friends also for watching sporting events....I recommend the upstairs balcony for the view"}
{"text":"The Grapevine is one of those places that you always randomly walk by and think \"I've got to try this place out,\" but because of it's obscure, off-the-beaten-path location it's easy to forget.  

I think one of the best parts about the Grapevine is the diverse realm of fun you can have.  Whether it's some day-drinking up on the patio for Spring Training, some racious karaoke with a distinctly more...experienced...crowd, or grabbing some pizza in a dimly lit dining area, The Grapevine is definitely not a bad place to stop.

It's been a while since I've had the food here, but from what I remember it was pretty tastey and equally reasonable in terms of price.  Drinks are a little on the expensive side, but hey - that's Old Town!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken Cajun strips- good taste
New York and shrimp plate- very good
Service- I will give them 5 out of 10 - bartender was yelling at her cellphone fighting with her boyfriend? Using the F word in front of clients. She also fought with a co worker, not very nice. 
Drinks were ok, but if I go back it would be only for the terrace and the karaoke. Order bottled beer, drinks are watery."}
{"text":"I always love it when traveling out of town, and find a good restaurant which does the basics Fairly well.  Service wasn't too bad and I had the Alfredo with chicken.  What a surprise, the chicken was pretty good and the Alfredo wasn't bland like most places.  

Four stars given for the nice mist sprayer in the temperatures as hot as the surface of the sun and for meeting expectations for a weary out of town traveler."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor patio bar. Good prices. Conveniently located in Old Town Scottsdale. Easy access from the Hilton Garden Inn."}
{"text":"Went here with my family while visiting AZ.  Restaurant was nearly empty.  It took a while before someone even came out and asked us for drinks etc.  

Anyway we ordered food it was bland.  All the food lacked seasoning.  My wife's chicken dish was frozen inside. We sent it back and told them to just keep it since she had lost her appetite. Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but then it was a really, really bad day. Proceed with caution.

2 Stars for ambiance. I liked the deco."}
{"text":"Hate to say these words and hate to be this person.. but unfortunately it had to be said.  Came in from California for a reality check - had a group of 13 girls spending hundreds of dollars on a few rounds, requesting songs, and we were pushed aside to say the least.  While the waitress constantly hassled us to buy drinks if we were sitting, we put some of the girls down for songs and we had 1 person go up in the 2+ hours we were there.  While one could argue there was a large cue to accommodate, it was strange to see people come up and sing 2 or 3 songs in a row.. but our group couldn't get anyone else a song?  There couldn't have been more than 40 people in there, so mathematically it doesn't make sense.  While I don't wanna say it.. This place felt super racist.  They were all for taking our money, and wouldn't give us a chance to participate in \"the fun\".  We were visiting town for a bachelorette party and ended up at the wrong spot, I would absolutely avoid this place if I could do it again. I get that places have regulars and need to honor that, but paying customers should be respected in the same light.  We left disappointed and the bride (calmly) mentioned her concerns to our waitress, just to point out that this is an issue and not a way to run a business.  Our bachelorette was given a *dismissal* hand motion, which was a completely disgusting way to handle the situation.  Can't fully put our feelings and reaction into words- but this was a extreme disappointment/ perspective of this establishment.  I'm hurt and angry, and wish we  knew otherwise- hoping to pass on the knowledge here."}
{"text":"Took forever to sing one song. Was not a regular, but dang."}
{"text":"Always I have found a good time here! Downstairs they have 'Cowboy Karaoke' the local old timers singing old time hits... And you know what? It's always entertaining. I've met and had great conversations with the bar patrons. Been upstairs with the tiki torches going on cool evenings with the younger crowd too. Something for everyone at The Vine. One time really drunk I looked over an saw Elvis enjoying himself here as well. Well bourbon in a short glass with coke, nice price, very reasonable so I'll stay for another, and maybe get a bite to eat. Here you will find the real old west of scottsdale, that you've been looking for"}
{"text":"The drinks are cheap, so you can afford to have enough to make you sound good. 

The drinks are cheap, so you can afford to have enough to make other people sound good.

I've heard the best rendition of RESPECT I will ever hear in my lifetime at The Grapevine.  It was sung by a straight man using a feminine voice and it was so bad it was good.  

My friends sang a Spanish duet that I begged them not to sing and two people actually sang along!?  I thought that shiz was gonna bomb, but I was wrong.  

You will probably be the last to sing if you are not a regular.  That would be me and so I always get screwed.  I end up singing \"I Touch Myself\" to my friends and the only other person in the room who's name hasn't been called.  

If you do get the chance to sing at a peak time, drunk strangers will probably dance behind you on stage, some may even try to come up and sing along with you.  Someone will most certainly play the bongo drums in the corner, and that someone will most definitely not pay attention to the beat.

Sounds fun, doesn't it?"}
{"text":"We went there for my daughters bachelorette party, had a blast until we went to leave and were chased out the door and told we didn't tip enough. Never going back again"}
{"text":"Best best best double fried chicken wings!!  Amazing service as well ambiance.  Try it out, it's a must!!"}
{"text":"I go to this bar all the time and it's great, such a fun time. However, last night I went with a few of my friends as DD and went to watch them sing some karaoke and our server was literally the rudest person I've ever met. I ordered a water and she came back and told me there is a one drink minimum in order to be there and \"water doesn't count\". I told her I was DD so I wouldn't be drinking (my friends were ordering drinks so I don't understand what the problem was) and she proceeded to tell me I needed to spend money to be there. I was waiting for my friends to finish their drinks so we could leave and she comes back to see that my water was gone. She then asked if needed more and I said \"sure, thank you\", she smiled sarcastically at me and then walked away without filling my water. I could then see her pointing to me and talking about to to other employees and when she came to pick up our empty bottles/glasses she told me next time I HAD to order a drink and she would remember me. I will not come back to this bar until this lady is gone she was the worst server I've ever had."}
{"text":"I give it a one star because on Fridays and Saturdays they allow it to be packed to the rafters. Too many loud obnoxious drunks who have been drinking at other places come in at 10ish.  I will invite the Scottsdale Fire Marshall to come to this place and see the Fire Code violations and \" over the top capacity\" on weekends. Not safe at all. An accident waiting to happen."}
{"text":"I LOVE karaoke & I would NOT be offended if you called me a \"karaoke whore.\" I sing in the shower, I sing at the grocery store, I WAIL in the car, I LOVE to sing! So when my Yelp-mates decided to visit the Grapevine, I was allllllll in

Please know that the Grapevine is a dive and people here sing a ton of country music. They've got a guy who runs the karaoke and sits in a small booth in the corner of the main bar. You'll be able up select from two books, one by artist & one by song title. The song selection was decent but certainly not the best I've ever seen. The crowd is on average in their 40s-50s but if you're younger it's waaay more fun if you go there with your friends. The sound in the bar is a bit off balance but the Grapevine offers a fun time!!

{"text":"Service was really great, drinks were AWESOME!!! Get the Persian!!! We sat outside under an umbrella and had a nice time. Our food was insane and came out within 15 minutes. Ask for Brie - super sweet and great waitress."}
{"text":"We sat for a while and never got into the rotation to sing. Other parties whom signed up well before us got to take their turns again and again but we never got called up. Boo, I think the dj knows regulars that frequent the place often and will allow them frequent turns. 

I was very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Cute rooftop bar and it was a beautiful day so I decided to try the restaurant. Cocktails were good However the food was subpar. The waitress was uninformed about the menu and have not tried anything. If you are looking for a patio and drinks this the good place but I recommend going somewhere else for the food."}
{"text":"That last star is what I'm calling \"The Beard Bump.\" I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt (non-drinker here, so beverage-wise I don't really have a measuring stick) because I was pretty wowed by the KJ's beard. A silver chinstrap appropriate for a man of his karaoke stature.

That's what this place was all about. Karaoke. Not ambiance, not food, not drinks (see parenthetical note above) but pure, sing-your-heart-out screeching goodness.

When we arrived it was old school obscure songs by the regulars. People who had made bad decisions in their lives but were still clinging to the microphone of hope. Quite unamused by our crowd, they soon cleared out and we darn near had our own private karaoke room, save for the fellow in the Simpsons t-shirt and the ladies who were hooked on singing and may have walked the streets to find The Grapevine.

Loud songs. Country. Inappropriate lyrics and gyrations. And it was all under the watchful whiskers of that magnificent white beard."}
{"text":"I've been to The Grapevine twice and love it! Whether you're sitting on the upstairs patio near the bar or downstairs in the open-air restaurant (don't worry - there's still plenty of shade), it's relaxing and more importantly, delicious! I recommend the Lahvosh, which is a type of pizza made on Armenian cracker bread! Yum! I will say if you don't like birds, you may not enjoy sitting there. The birds aren't really afraid of humans anymore and tend to hop around the vine design at the side of the lower section or on the ledge of the upstairs patio. They will also come inside the lower section and hop around on empty tables, etc. The upstairs patio also has a wonderful view of Camelback Mountain!"}
{"text":"I kinda liked this place.  Food wasn't the best but it was priced reasonably.  Service was good and it was nice to sit outside on a quiet patio upstairs.  It just had pleasant atmosphere that made you feel comfortable, and welcome.  Again, food not the best but more than adequate and priced reasonably."}
{"text":"Hopefully they like your song choices or else you will buy drinks while waiting to get your name called.. The table next to us got here after us and submitted their song choices after us and got to perform before us.  Geisha Go Go is better and you'll spend the same amount and actually get to sing!"}
{"text":"Wow! Came here with family on a Monday night.  We sat on the patio and the view was great. . However that is where all the good ends.  We were a party of four and two kids and between us we ordered 4 meals.  We got two meals delivered and then nothing, the server just left.  Then, we got another meal, again with no explanation about where the last meal was.  After a few minutes of waiting,  the server stormed by in a rush to tell us that the flatbread was made incorrectly and that's what we were waiting on.  Meanwhile, I started to nibble on my chicken taco salad. ...and it was awful.  It was like canned chili meat thrown on  some spinach and  lettuce with an unappetizing blob of sour cream.  Missing the black olives the menu promised me, I thought I would ask for them.  When I did, the server literally turned and walked away from me before the sentence was out of my mouth.  Finally the flatbread came out, but it wasn't the made the way it was ordered.  When this was pointed out, the server actually said, well I didn't  hear you say that and whirled around with the food with no further explanation.  When it did  come back, the mushrooms had just been scraped off, which was not okay.  When told this, the server said, well what do you want me to do about it? 
When I tried to  speak to the manager, the server interrupted and said you can tell me.  When I started to explain why we were unhappy, she tried to make excuses about her other 3 tables she had to serve and finally cut me off saying I'll just get you another server and walked away.  
I did explain the situation to the \"night manager\" and she comped the terrible food and gave us a piece of cake.  Plus we did get a new server, who did much better.
Overall, not a great experience and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Bartender: You're a DB. Be fucking nice. We tip you.

If karaoke isn't for you, there's also outside and upstairs seating, which offers nice views of Old Town Scottsdale. The food is also pretty good - the double-fried wings are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to write a review on this place because I thought it would be a waste of time but when my grandma insisted I decided to take the time. What grandma says goes! She said in all her 84 years she has NEVER had a worse dining experience! And she emphasizes, well... I... never...

I do agree with her it was rather awful. The waitress was beyond rude and unhelpful. For some reason she had a rather large chip on her shoulder especially after we didn't want to order alcoholic drinks... 

Not that it matters a huge amount but the open sores she had on her face didn't offer an appetizing environment. The food was shall I say inedible to be kind. And the worst part of it all was we told the hostess about the server and the food...guess what she said! 'Yeah I know!' that waitress is mean but she's been here way too long to get rid of AND she has her good days and bad days guess this was a bad one! And the food, yeah what you ordered isn't my favorite thing either the bread is terrible. Hope you come again!

W.T.H.

I don't have much else to say except my grandma is still talking about the horror of this dining catastrophe!"}

{"text":"Great karaoke spot. Little area that can get high energy real quick. I'd love to come for the food sometime but honestly can't offer a review on that. 

It's a good starter place for a good night out, if not for the whole night."}
{"text":"This is a cool ass little place, how have I never seen this?
Lived in AZ since the 80's, never been a Scottsdale fan. But after a hike on Camelback today, my girl wanted to continue our afternoon. She used to come here in high school. I wish I was hungry, but we just had a couple of cocktails and enjoyed the 2nd level patio and people watched. Charming staff as well. I look forward to coming back here soon, the menu looked great!!!"}
{"text":"You didn't hear it through the grapevine...you heard it straight from the horses mouth. DO NOT GO HERE FOR KARAOKE. Go for people watching if anything. I should've known when I called ahead. The sweet girl on the phone gave us directions. All of my friends were adamant about other places and I was rooting for the nice bartender and the possibility of a song.

When we arrived the place was packed! Yet she still knew I was the one who called (very Children of the Corn). I immediately (at 8:15) put 2 songs in. I said you can just pick one if it fits your line-up. Hoping they'd call me and then one of the 4 people I strung along would add a song in.

This did not happen. 

While we each had 3-4 drinks (and 14 songs played), yes, I counted them. Not one persons name was EVER called. It was like a 2-disc CD was playing and they already knew who was next. 

If you are new and you are going here to sing. Wait to be disappointed. It's so weird. Not like a cool dive bar weird, but like a scripted twilight zone that you will never be a part of weird. 

This bar doesn't need you. They have a following that will always be there. Lesbian softball chicks, older divorcees, old country dudes, and those women who debated on wearing their scrunchees, that dude with dreads that sings the lamest song from the 50s soda shop...amongst others. 

And you will still wait. But the CRAZIEST thing is that a name will never be called out. It's like a 3-disc set is playing. Before you know it someone else has the mic in their hand, because it's \"their turn\". 

I heard a woman singing Jeff Buckleys \"hallelujah\", which isn't a very popular song. But once I saw every demographic in the place singing it word for word, I knew. This wasn't a place to be reckoned with. You don't see a 60 year old man singing that song, unless they sing it so much you learn it! And that's what happens. It's a CD on rotation.

AND YOU DONT PLAY A PART. Go somewhere else.

14 songs, and you're not going to get called. 

My friend said to me jokingly, \"go sit on Santas lap and ask for your song.\" Not that I would have. But it was humorous. 

Regardless of naught or nice, Santa will only play that song if he knows you've been coming there for years. Less work. Lazy DJ. 

But they don't need you, so don't go."}
{"text":"Save yourself an unpleasant eating and drinking experience and avoid this place.

My partner and I ordered the french dip sandwiches - they arrived dry and plain.  Our drink order took at least 20 minutes to arrive even though there were only a few tables with customers.  The drinks seemed watery.

We sat on a warm afternoon without having our waters replenished once.

There are too many negatives to even consider giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Part of me wants to give The Grapevine 5 stars because I thought it was awesome. Just consider this...

- At several points throughout the night our group was the only group of people in the place other than the KJ and bartenders. When this happened the KJ picked songs for us and made us sing them. Songs like I Like Big Butts or Short Dick Man
- The KJ joined several songs in accompaniment on the harmonica.
- It's a dive bar with karaoke!
- At one point the bartender was making me a drink and singing a karaoke song herself.

But, the truth is a 5 star rating might not be entirely fair. Because it is dirty and dim (as a dive bar should be). And personally I think they'd rather have their regulars in here than too many new, hipster-y folks indulging in the irony of singing a Salt-n-Pepa song while the older KJ plays along on his harmonica. And also, the place puts a hurting on your pocket book considering what kind of dive it is. I haven't seen prices this high in a karaoke joint since I last lived in SF. Ouch."}
{"text":"I have a mixed review for this place, we started at the upstairs bar, the old timer bartender
who's picture is everywhere wouldn't even aknowledge us. We waited 15 minutes without a 
single word from anyone. After that, we went downstairs and we were well taken care of.
I surely wont be back here."}
{"text":"The charming atmosphere says, \"Stay awhile and unwind\". Service was friendly and food was refreshingly different than most \"bar food\" menus. Park nearby, do your shopping first, you won't want to leave once you are here."}
{"text":"After sitting through two rotations without ever being called I'm convinced the KJ was playing favorites. Unlike the KJ, the bar staff was attentive and friendly. If I'm in town I may be back, but if the same guy is behind the desk I'll move on."}
{"text":"Very nice patio upstairs, great place to sit back have a drink and dinner watch the sun set. The bar is a little loud so just make sure you re prepared, they had music as well playing so a conversation at the table might be a little hard. so the food is tasty, the blacken' blue burger was a hand pressed patty of meat not your frozen perfect shaped patty which i hate. The fries were just fries nothing special that i could tell, i've also tried the Mahi Mahi sandwich which was also good. If you find yourself here in the cooler months of the year you'll love the patio and find it hard to want to leave. The service was a little slow but i'm typically a little more tolerable than most when it comes to slowness."}
{"text":"Wonderful indoor/outdoor cafe in Old Scottsdale, AZ. We ate in the shade under the deck. Above deck there were plenty of table umbrellas for shade too. Menu choices were plentiful. Our party of 4 had  potato skins, a Reuben sandwich, a French Dip, a bowl of soup (chicken dumpling), and a Scottsdale salad. The portions were large and extremely tasty. One couple owns 3 restaurants and they were very impressed by this little gem of a place. I had a mojito - excellent! Rose was our waitress, bartender, and cashier. She gave us super service!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure which was worse, the food or the service. Took way too long to even be acknowledged when we sat down for starters. The food, from a rather limited menu, was awful. When we complained we were comped one meal with no apology or comments whatsoever. One star for the nice view from the upper level. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Things got weird here... in a an awesome way. Came here a few weeks back for their daily karaoke and it didn't disappoint. The bar itself has a few different areas to it - an outdoor space, indoor dining area, and a small area for drinks and karaoke (I'm sure you can order food here as well). We were lucky enough to snag a table in the karaoke zone before the place filled up and became standing room only. While there were a bunch of regulars there showing off their chops, there were also a healthy amount of amateurs ready to lead crowd sing alongs to forgotten pop tunes. A big plus to the packed crowd was that everyone was into it and applauding, singing along, and being a sport to the 'performers' rather than the singers (my air humping often needs to rescue my singing). Things got raucous fast and it was entirely too much fun to watch and participate. If you're looking for a no-frills, fun karaoke night out, this is your spot! 

Bonus: Our waitress and the karaoke MC were super friendly"}
{"text":"What a Blast!! The folks a Grapevine are Super!! I called about having a group of coworkers coming in for some team building karaoke! Ray & Rose were both very helpful in arranging the date and making sure that they had staff to accommodate our group! They don't take reservations so we had a few folks arrive early on Sunday to secure some tables which wasn't a problem! The DJs were nice and made sure everyone had an opportunity to perform! The wait staff was friendly and engaging too!! I have to say what made the evening was the warm & welcoming spirit of the Regular Folks that come often! What great folks...sharing fries, dancing, duetting and just having a Great Time! My coworkers had a fantastic time and I am sure we will be having More events at Grapevine!! Thanks Again Ray, Rose, and Katie our server for a Wonderful Event!!"}
{"text":"This place needs bar rescue from spike tv channel . Grapevine Has amazing potential but the food was horrible . Taste like already prepared package food . Our waiter was cool . No complaints there . I actually felt sorry for her having to give us this food . Honestly though wasn't that bad . I ate it . Just wouldn't come back and eat here again ."}
{"text":"My husband, two year son and I just started going here and really like it. They have cheap happy hour appetizers but do not reduce the portions,. Their wings are huge! The staff has always been friendly and the service very decent. The menu offers your usual American food but, again, the portions are larger than a lot of other place. We want to come for karaoke but need a babysitter. One of these days....Check it out."}
{"text":"No matter what hour of the day, day of the week, or time of the year - the Grapevine is a must visit kind of place for locals and tourists alike!  

The patio upstairs is fantastic for hanging out with your family or friends, grabbing a bite to eat, and relaxing and enjoying the sunshine.  The bar upstairs has TVs, so you'll be able to catch whatever game you are trying to see. 

For happy hour and on into the night, you can stay and rock out to the karaoke. The people here aren't messing around!   You'll get a little bit of everything from Elvis to Dixie Chicks to Sir Mix a Lot.   Where could you find that kind of entertainment all in one place?!"}
{"text":"Grapevine is one of the only karaoke bars within a many, many mile radius. Because of this, Grapevine gets an A-OK because this bar can offer a good time if you go in the right mindset. The right mindset is when you're ready to belt it out with the \"best of them\" aka, a combination of elderly people and really drunk young people. 

I would really only ever go to the Grapevine for karaoke. I've eaten here a couple of times and the food is par. The venue itself is older, a little warn down and in need of some TLC. However, the clientele probably doesn't case because again, most people visit the Grapevine after several cocktails in order to live out their dreams of being on America Idol. 

Be warned that the while the Grapevine itself is spacious with a decently sized second floor deck, the karaoke is inside and it can get very cramped. There are only a handful of tables inside and on a night and especially a weekend night, it will be very crowded and will most likely take a little bit of time to get a drink and sing. The old timers who are regulars here take their singing very seriously so don't even think about cutting in front of them! :)"}
{"text":"I call this my hidden gem! I love going here and sitting on the open roof that over looks Old Town. Go to watch the sunset for great views and see a shot of Camelback. I've always had super friendly service and the food is awesome. I just wish I'd taken pictures every time I was there."}
{"text":"We sat at the upstairs bar that was nice and open to outside. You can eat/drink  indoors or outdoors. The view was nice upstairs. We had a beer and shared an order of onion rings. Onion rings were very good. Staff was super friendly and went out of the way to find a certain sports game on TV for us. Would love to return to eat dinner there."}
{"text":"Alcohol fueled Karaoke in a dive bar setting. What fun!

Although I didn't perform my own song, I went hoarse singing along with the others."}
{"text":"I have never experienced racism to this degree. Came here with my friends (of which we are all multicultural). It took nearly 2 hours to have a chance to sing. Even after tipping Gimli (the \"Dj\" who chooses who sings next) he still would push off our songs and give priority to all the other white patrons. 

We sang along with the American music we know, and cheered for the people we don't know. We were discriminated, and did not have the opportunity to sing our karaoke songs after 2+ hours of waiting. The same patrons (who seemed like locals and usuals at the bar) were given multiple opportunities to sing. Once we realized that they were pushing our opportunity to participate, we were approached by the owner who asked why we were leaving. We told him we felt discriminated, and he responded back by telling us \"well, most people tip the DJ\" even though we had tipped the DJ 15+ dollars. Out of the 3 people that tipped, only 1 person sang after 2 hours. 

I have not felt or experienced this type of discrimination / racism at any of the other bars or restaurants in Scottsdale. But walking into this location, I knew we were in the wrong place on the wrong night.

Don't even think about karaeoking in Scottsdale unless you're white."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is the only good thing about this restaurant. The service was absolutely terrible. Noon on a weekend and not very busy and the waitress staff were the worst we have come across. People that sat down long after us got there food before us. When we asked the waitress after 40 mins to check on our food she came back with it and it was cold. None of the food we had was good. I would stay away."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale with my local family looking for a place yhat 10 people can all find something they all would like we found Grapevine in old town, nice patio not to busy for a Saturday afternoon.  After we got sat, drink order placed the wait began. From yhe time the waitress took our order to the time the first plate arrived was 45min.
Now we are talking grilled cheese, chix tenders, club sand, quesidilla, 3 other cold sandwich and a couple burgers. All the food came out cold. The grease from the quesidilla was so bad thst the tortilla coouldnt even hold the filling. Grilled cheese that wasnt melted. Soggy bread on all the sandwiches.  Under cooked chix wings. This place was so bad we asked to speack with the manager who kindly comped the entire meal gave us excuse after excuse why the service was bad and food not cooked well. My advise your better off going to Dennys."}
{"text":"Honestly for Old Town I'm very disappointed. The staff was friendly but the bar tender made my mojito with 7-up instead of soda water. Yuck. This place is so cute and needs to pick a theme and stick with it. If you're looking for a fancy diner this is the place. They had everything on the menu from burgers, pasta, pizza, steak and fish, sandwiches etc. When I see that large of a variety I know the place isn't GREAT at anything.  Just OK at most, and I was right. The food wasn't impressive."}
{"text":"Older crowd. Was hella fun. Been 3 years since I've last been. Good times."}
{"text":"Had a great evening with some great friends on the upper deck, watching the sun set and sipping some great margaritas. Had a few things from the menu, nothing to write home about though. Will be back for some more of that great atmosphere real soon."}
{"text":"Old town... karaoke... cold drinks... I mean I really don't think there are many establishments that can offer these three things every single night of the week.  For that reason, despite the drastic need for updating / polishing of ambiance / décor, they deserve four stars.  

You know that scene in Swingers when they go to The Dresdin?  And the old couple is singing 'Stayin' Alive' on purpose?  Yeah - it was a lot like that - except the older folks singing weren't paid to do so and the crowd was a healthy mix of 21-90.

We showed up around 7'ish on a Sunday night smack dab in the middle of the older clientele rocking out.  Now, I had never seen a collection (like 30) older people care less about what anyone thinks regarding their singing voice.  This was kind of a treat in the people watching arena.  I heard songs I have never heard, nor want to hear again... I saw legit bell bottoms and junk grabbing like I haven't seen in years... They were flirting and dancing and drinking - and then about an hour later I saw the coffees start arriving at their tables as the songs / karaoke shifted to the younger folk.

Most of them shuffled out at that point, but some stayed to witness songs THEY'VE never heard and thus I got to witness a karaoke dichotomy that I'd never seen before.

The service was good, the prices were higher than average, ('cause Old Town)... but the evening was a success and based on living less than a mile away, I'm sure we'll be back many times going forward.  Great job Grapevine!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple of days ago.  

Place was dead.  Only one other table had people at it.  Service was quick.  Reuben sandwich I ordered was delivered promptly.  Meat was tasty but not exactly plentiful (I'm used to a New York style Reuben - with loads of meat).  Potato salad that came with the sandwich was very good, a pleasant surprise.  

Outdoor seating was nice, though the birds did get tiresome.  Place seemed clean.  Plenty of seats.  Upstairs deck area would be great in the evening.  Seems like it would be a much more fun place with a group of people for happy hour  or dinner than it was for lunch.  

Bottom line - it was okay.  Not bad, not great.  I'd give it another try but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"I don't really feel compelled to write to much about this place... only for the fact that i didn't have a terribly horrible time... but i didn't have the time of my life either.... i met up with some fellow yelpers which was the high light of the night of course :-)   ... but i was my own DD so no drinking for me... only lemon Water :) mmmm..... so good.... the bathrooms were very clean... but the toilets were so low i was practically sitting on the floor... and the stall door was so close it was about an inch from my knees... uncomfortable.... the last chick at the very end of the night had the mic last.... and she couldn't even keep up with the rap song SHE CHOSE.... so she apparently felt the need to start cursing at everyone else to sing it too... are you serious?? it completely lowered her from a lady to a tramp in 2 seconds... i was done... i would go again.... but i would definitely relocate by midnight...."}
{"text":"In 2006 I really loved this place.  I took friends here all the time, I even took my parents.  Back then I hung out at the Grapevine literally 3xs a week for karaoke, but the last couple of years the place has really taken a nose-dive.  The last 2 times I was there, the karaoke host was extremely rude to me and other guests - the one I'm talking about is a middle -aged large female with over-bleached hair and terrible body odor.  She made fun of people's singing and insisted on singing 2 or 3 songs in a row herself while customers were waiting an hour to sing.  At one point she even came up and ripped the mic from my hand as I was ending a song, and I wasn't the only person she interrupted either.

As much as I used to adore karaoke at the Grapevine, after that I will never return."}
{"text":"It was freezing in PHX. OK, well for a bay area guy going to the desert it was cold! We were looking for a lunch place in old scottsdale and found this place. We were so happy. A cozy, friendly place with lovely, warm service. 
The food was good for what it is. They also do karaoke at night which we missed. We'll be back the next time for that.

If you happen to be there, definitely try it out!!!"}
{"text":"Let's me just start out that I will never ever bring my business to this restaurant. I came here for the first time ever for my 10 year high school reunion. Although it was busy and I'm sure a little over whelming for the bartender but that doesn't mean someone gets treated like dirt, especially a paying costumer. I walked in and went to the bar to order my very FIRST drink ... did I mention It was my first drink. After I ordered he gave me a price of 19 dollars!!! How can a drink cost so much? So I simply asked why did it cost so much. And the bartender very rudely responded with very frustrated attitude towards me with you're cut off. For asking a price of a drink? Wow never heard of anyone being cut off for asking a question. And I've been in the restaurant industry for over 10 years. He also told me I was cut off because I was talking on my phone.... I didn't know this place was a prison. Can't ask simple questions and for sure don't be on your phone. You'll get treated like dirt if you do. Then I think it was a manager that came over to me and told me I had to leave... never once did she ask me what is going on? Or tried to get down to the bottom of what was going on. This place clearly doesn't want paying costumers to stick around and give their restaurant business.  Horrible experience, very rude unprofessional staff. I will never bring my business here again and I for sure will never tell anyone of my friends or family members to bring their money to this horrible, disrespectful place. I'd give this place no stars but it made me have to choose and Star. But this deserves no stars for how disrespectful they treat their costumers."}
{"text":"I love this place for these reasons:

* Best west-facing patio in old town. It's upstairs on rooftop and during the winter months, it's a phenomenal spot to lizard-out while eating & drinking.
* The food is good. Love to share the lavoshes, and Franco makes one hell of a bloody mary
* They have the best potato-skins in the cosmos! Seriously. I know you're thinking \"who gives a rip about potato skins?\". Just try them and tell me I'm wrong. Won't happen. 
* The upstairs patio & bar is a great place to just hang out whether you're eating, drinking or both. They have nice TVs for the games and a kick-ass old juke box. They also recently enclosed the bar area with glass, so it's more comfy during the warmer months. 
* Downstairs, in back of the restaurant, there's a cutty bar that's nice and dark...and cool. They have karaoke all the time and apparently it does down in there. I don't karaoke, but occasionally when I hit the head, I'll do a hot lap back there to check out the folks' pipes. Decent. 
*The location is incredible. Walking distance to anything you'd want in old town. 


The only drawbacks to this place are:

* That west facing roof-top patio can be brutal in the summer. We'll see how much the enclosed glass helps. I've been recently to the upstairs bar after the sun is down, and that was reasonably cool. 
* During the winter, you will see loads of tourists, fanny packs, white socks & Burkenstocks, freshly-purchased turquoise jewelry, picture taking with what appears to be safari outfits, etc. Small price to pay I suppose. 

Weekend brunches in the winter is where you might find me there. 
Cheers!"}
{"text":"My husband and another couple went here to eat.  We had a rubuen, scotsdale salad, potato skins, french dip and soup.  All of our meals were fabulous and we are harsh critics.  Our waitress, Rose, was fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to go out and do something fun on Friday night. With his love for singing we chose to go to karaoke at The Grapevine. Glad we did! They had a plethora of songs to choose from in the catalog. My husband got to sing about 5 times. The karaoke DJ was fair on making sure everyone had equal opportunities to sing. We enjoyed the atmosphere of the quaint inside bar and the refreshing breeze from the outdoor patio. You won't be disappointed in their menu. They have an all around menu - something for everybody. We chose to share the The Everything Lavosh. Crispy crust and tasty toppings. I am sure we will come back and have a blast again!"}
{"text":"Super fun place filled with really nice folks.  Arrivedcat 9:30pm ordered asian salad and shrimp.  Bartenders are very friendly and attentive.  Sang karaoke...also KJ was very cool...sang twice.
Good fum night...came alone but made some friends."}
{"text":"Just went here for dinner on a Saturday night,The food,atmosphere and building are prity excellent.My only complaints would be that although it was not at all ''packed'' in the bar area the bartenders seemed completely overwhelmed and actually got a bit irate with me when i ordered a Mojito,Scottsdale is usually the place to get well made cocktails by competent mixologists Isnt the point to sell the more expensive drinks not just the happy hour bud lights?!?! ,Also my wife and I are both 31 and were by at least 15 years the youngest people in the room,,Fix the service and staff issues this would be the best spot in old town."}
{"text":"Talk about Karaoke dive bar, amiright?

This Scottsdale beauty is the essence of a Karaoke dive bar complete with tacky decorations and lonely souls. 

They even have someone who will wait on you! Fancy pantsy. 

At no point did I regret the decision of coming here and I would totally return. It's nothing fancy and does it's job well! I'm in."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review because we went there tonight because I love karaoke  and that part was fantastic. however, this place really needs new bartenders. I think she said her name was mia, it was loud and hard to hear, but she was awful from the minute we got there. I arrived with a group of 7 people who  all ordered drinks. She acted like we were a nuisance to her and gave us dirty looks the whole time. When we asked her for drinks she rolled her eyed and scowled. My fiancé is super sweet and thought she was having a bad day so he tried to cheer her up by complimenting her and  trying to make her laugh but she shot him dirty looks. There was only one other group there and they were obviously wasted. They could barely sing anymore and just kept bouncing around  and goofing off, which is normal for a bar. Except that she treated us like outsiders that didn't belong there. My friends went to cheer and spilled a tiny bit of beer because the glass was full. They were nice enough to apologize and clean it up and Mia told them they have to leave cause they were breaking things. There were 7 of us and not one person saw anything broken.. Just a few drops of beer that they so graciously cleaned up themselves. Mia said she didn't wanna clean up after us so we had to leave. At this point I decided she didn't deserve the nice tip my friend left on the counter. I told her to take it back, and the other bartender, an overweight brunette who's name I don't know, heard me and snatched it up quickly before I could. I had to tell Mia directly that she  gave us the worst service ever and I cannot allow my friend to tip her. She reluctantly gave it back. It takes this much for me to not tip someone. I'm a huge tipper. I work for tips too so I understand how this works, but I would never treat clients like she treated us. I earn my tips. This was literally the worst service I have ever had. 
Mia needs to find a new career because service  and friendliness are not her forte."}

{"text":"Grapevine and I go together like Del Maguey Chichicapa Mezcal and Dr Pepper, but fuggit if I don't enjoy myself here in adult-spring-break-fantasyland.

Its awkward at first, how someone my age feels like the GILF-hunter recruiting for the bangbus parked o'er yonder at Martini Ranch or somewhere equally creepy.  But once you find your niche and the fat book of songs -- I mean its REAALLY extensive -- then you can kick it a bit and enjoy the reduced rates of Scottsdale's version of what I imaging the bar at Club Med to be like ... lots of Tommy Bahama and Ann Taylor A-line dresses with Hibiscus prints ... everyone in Finn Comfort sandals.  

Anyway, between your enthusiastic head nods through Don From Sales' rock n roll air-flute to Jethro Tull's 'Aqualung' and The Ladies of Sun Valley Office Park Suite B14's interpretation of Tiny Dancer, you can sign yourself up.  Graham C has balls the size of watermelons and after a small amount of coaxing, was convinced by our small party to rock the mic to Arctic Monkey's 'I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor'.

Por favor, beleive that there is nothing more exciting than four twentysomething dweebs holding their Amstels mouthward, Marlboro 100's [hey, its all they sold at Grapevine] behind the ear  like they're playing a sold-out Wembley belting out:

\"FROM NINETEEEEN EIIIIIGHTY FOOOOOOOOOOURRR!!\"

Graham is teh tits."}
{"text":"I can't believe I got to review this place before the DG! I feel honored and privileged. For all of the 2 star haters: THIS PLACE IS DOPE!!!! 

I have never eaten food here. It has always been too late in the night for that. Plus, there was only one thing on our minds when we go. KARA-fucking-OKE!!! Well, I mostly am inebriated and Z and Dally want to sing. The people that run the jams remind me of the house band at the Dresden in Swingers. There is always this older dude there that insists on playing the bongos along to every song. Even if it doesn't fit. 

Inevitably we sing \"Don't Stop Believin'\", \"Piano Man\", and \"Sweet Caroline\". It will be a group of us guys and it is a good time had by all. One time I worked up the courage to sing a song with my buddy Z that didn't involve everyone at the bar. We did \"Black\" by Pearl Jam. I think it went well. It felt like it did anyway. 

I always have a blast when I am here. Save the time my ex-wife and the girl I was seeing at the time came within about 5 feet of each other. It felt like my head was going to explode. I think Garth Algar said it best,\"Did you ever see that part in Scanners when that guys head exploded?\" No amount of alcohol could have made me drunk that night.   

You will see a very eclectic mix of people in here, but don't be scared."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio seating is the greatest perk about this restaurant next to location.  If you are looking for a place to day drink this is your spot.  If you are looking for below average cuisine, this is your place.   The food may be acceptable with a hefty buzz, but as a sober dinner, it was deplorable. To add salt to the wound, the ketchup bottle top placed on our table had black \"stuff\" encrusted inside of it.  This was realized after the meal was over, making my stomach turn.  The only reason I gave 2 stars rather than 1 is because the 2 story outdoor patio is nearly one of a kind in Old Town Scottsdale and the service was good.  My tip to the Grapevine; please get a new menu!"}
{"text":"The only thing saving Grapevine is the awesome karaoke DJ James. Service at this place is terrible. I'm usually one to give someone the benefit of the doubt the first time as everyone has off nights.  But, where I draw the line is bartenders on their phones behind the bar and grabbing my beer before I'm finished.  To add to that, the level of service has been consistently bad a few times in a row.  What's worse is that the waitresses and bartenders are never really that busy and always seem to be inconvenienced by patrons who just want another cocktail.  I've drawn the line and will not be returning. I hope you do the same."}
{"text":"Burgers are the way to go here. Upstairs has nice monsters and air conditioning but can still look out over Old town Scottsdale. Will be back later on as they are rated top karaoke bar in the area!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. Our server was rushed and very short with us. Brought us our bill and did not even ask if we wanted dessert. WTF??? The pizza was cold!!! We did not want to say anything to our server but she was so frantic. AND she had a fresh tattoo on her right arm reaching over the guests."}
{"text":"100% dive bar located in Old Town Scottsdale. Who ever thought of that one is one smart cat. Provide the classic dive atmosphere with dim lighting, stiff drinks and KARAOKE, while charging Scottsdale pricing. By far one of the funnest Karaoke bars I've been to besides the Lamplighter in San Diego. It's funny to walk into a place like this in Old Town to find a mixed crowd of people ranging from 25 years of age to probably 60! I'd say the highlights of this place were the KJ, who had our group in stitches all night. He has us singing songs like \"I Like Big Butts and Short Dick Man,\"  and the bongos on the stage. I can't speak to the menu since we didn't eat there, but it looked like standard/average bar fare. I had a blast and I you will too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, casual atmosphere. Nice wait staff. Reasonable prices. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Regulars pull rank on the songs with the Mr Karoake dude running the show. But if you stick around, your song will come up eventually. They do need a better sound system. But hey, if you drink enough everyone sounds the same :) Generous pours and decent food."}
{"text":"We arrived when the bar was basically empty, so we ordered drinks and appetizers. The food was fine, but it's bar food... 
We really came for the karaoke, but we were TERRIBLY disappointed. My friend is a good  singer, but unless you're a local you MIGHT get to sing one song. If you're a Regular with Randy, you'll sing plenty. Do not get excited when you see this bar offers karaoke 7 nights a week... Unless you have that long to wait for your turn to sing..."}
{"text":"Best ceviche I have ever had!!! Crave it all day everyday. Hands down the best in Arizona."}
{"text":"I've only ever sat outside at The Grapevine so I'm not reviewing the apparently dark divey inside bar.    We had a great time.  I never had Lavosh before I tried it at The Grapevine and my eyes have been opened! (It's amazing - if you've never had it, it's basically cracker-pizza, except fancier.)  

If it weren't such a drive to Scottsdale I think we'd come here more often."}
{"text":"PACKED on Friday nights!

Decent drinks; the well 'rita was pretty good.

Our initial intent was to sing karaoke, but we had a large group and there just wasn't room.  So we enjoyed the downstairs open-air room."}
{"text":"Not great, mostly due to the service.  The upstairs space is mostly a bar, apparently has karaoke in the evenings.  I went for lunch, and sat downstairs which was under the balcony, and shady, but kind of dark and claustrophobic.  The greeter was a teenage kid who basically grunted at me when I walked in, \"upstairs or down?\"  The table was not wiped, and had crusty dried food spots on it.  The server was surly, no smile, no thank you.  Kind of afraid of the menu that was kind of all over the map, so I got the burger with cheese and bacon.  My iced tea took 10 mins to come, and the burger another 15 mins.  It was plopped down in front of me with no words, and the server walked away, so I had to get up to ask for condiments.  The burger itself came with shredded lettuce and tomato already on it, so you couldn't really disassemble it, but I managed to scrape off the lettuce, which I didn't want.  Other than that, not a bad burger, thick and handmade, with a good toasted bun.  They had a radio station playing over speakers which was either poorly tuned or not local, as it was very staticky and annoying.  As good burgers aren't hard to find in Old Town, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for karaoke on a Friday night with a large group. The place was accommodating and the service was attentive to our party! Would have liked more than one of the karaoke books listed by artist. The nachos weren't too good, but we liked the quesadilla. Might go again on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I truly believe that this is one of Scottsdale's hidden gems. I've lived here for 10 years and just recently discovered his place via a friend. It's such a fun spot where people sing Missy Elliot karaoke and the whole bar sings along. I had such a fun night and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"This review is based on being there for ~5-10 minutes and not getting service so we left. The location & patio are great! Despite it being a little chilly out, in the spring when it warms up, I would love the patio here. We came at like 7PM on a Tuesday night and it seemed like there were a few regulars at the bar. The bartender who was doing a bunch of other things & in & out of the bar area said she would be with us in a second but didn't come back for a while so we left. Also, the smell in the upstairs bar area was super weird, I asked my boyfriend if he thought so too. So for a first impression of the place & service kind of sucking I gave it 3 stars.. maybe I will come back sometime to update the review... TBD."}
{"text":"Theses people are racist! My mother was pushed out of the restaurant by a white lady and told she couldn't be there because my aunt is disabled and can't walk well!! They claimed my aunt was drunk since she can't walk and got physical with my mother. Meanwhile the manager was there and did nothing to stop her employee."}
{"text":"Any place that lets me have a microphone is insane! 

Yet totally worthy of being revisited. Preferentially sober, that way I don't have a repeat of last night's performance. Thank goodness most of you weren't there to hear it..."}
{"text":"Here for karaoke. The server couldnt care less about her section...the decor here is dusty and old, makes me fearful to even order food."}
{"text":"The waitress took our orders and then several people waited on us as if our table of 6 was an after thought. Our drinks were not refilled in a timely manner, food was below par and service seemed like they were doing us a favor by coming over. Will not go back. Two stars is a bit low but when you go out to eat you expect customer service to at least appear like they like their job.... They were not pleasant ( not rude or anything ) just did not present themselves as most serving people would. Not even house bread was served??? What's up with that?"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! We were staying right around the corner from here and were starving after the Giants spring training game and decided to come here... one of the worst decisions ever! We came here at about 9:30pm on Saint Patrick's Day and all we wanted was some food. 

We got seated right away on the upstairs patio. Our waitress came over very quickly and asked what we wanted to drink, we ordered 2 waters and a beer.... it took 20 damn minutes to get JUST our waters!!!!! 10 minutes after that the SINGLE beer my dad ordered came. Our waitress came back at about 10:15 (45 minutes after we sat down) to take our order. I ordered Chicken Strips and my dad ordered a Caesar salad... could not be an easier order, right???? WRONG! It was almost 11 o'clock before our food came! My fries were cold, my chicken strips were gross and frozen pieces of crap thrown in to a deep fryer and tossed on my plate. My dad's salad was just as disappointing.

I understand it was Saint Patrick's Day and the service might have been a little bit slower because of the crowd. But my waitress did not even wait on the people in the bar nor did they serve food in the bar so the sucky-ness and slowness had nothing to do with that! This place sucks A$$!"}
{"text":"Grapevine is a fun karaoke bar, and the only karaoke bar in Old Town as far as I know. I've had a lot of fun nights here. It's a great place to go for a birthday. It's tiny inside though so you may not get a table and even if you do you are in pretty close quarters. I've never eaten there but it's always packed upstairs on their patio during the weekends so my guess is that it's good. They have a good downstairs patio too. I prefer to go here once it's already dark outside, I just feel like it's that kinda place. It's pretty old school. Another fun perk is that a lot of wedding parties will come here (it seems like from out of town) and get wasted and fight and cause a bunch of chaos. That has been the case on NUMEROUS occasions and has always been entertaining. Probably not to the best man who got kicked out of the wedding the night before at the Grapevine, but it was for the rest of us. Also something kind of funny is that we went for a friend of mine's birthday one time and I signed her up for \"in da club\" by 50 cent ...obviously because it was her birthday. The staff like cut her off mid song because it was inappropriate or something. It was awkward, hilarious, and really friggen weird considering they had it in the book and I've heard people sing way worse there... Also I hope none of you have had to witness my terrible rendition of Fiona Apple."}
{"text":"Who would think that a place called The Grapevine would turn out to basically be a dive bar? Clearly, there were other intentions for this place when it opened years ago, but whatever works, right?  We stopped in for a couple of drinks and to listen to some karaoke. We didn't eat anything and I'm not sure that I would order food here.  As others have mentioned, the place is a bit run down and the restroom was pretty gross..not a very appetizing scenario.  Drinks were good though and the bartender was quick and friendly.  So if you know what to expect, this isn't a bad place to stop in if you're into this type of scene and want to grab some drinks while llistening or participating in karaoke."}
{"text":"I have looked at this place many times. Decided to drop in. Their main draw is karaoke at 5, happy hour at 7. Just so you know.  Pros:beer was cold. Good selection of brews. Service was friendly and pretty attentive.  They serve \"Armenian Pizza\" here, which is similar to the thin crust at Oregano's. As expected, I tried the wings, they have multiple \"ways\" here. We ordered Ray's Double Fried, in which they fry them after the sauce. Cools the heat down a bit but also the flavor. Second order was regular Buffalo style hot wings.  Kind of tough and dry. Don't need to have them again. 

The verdict? Good place for karaoke buffs and drinkers. I won't be back for the food. And remember, alcohol makes everyone a \"Karaoke Star\"."}
{"text":"Mediocre food.

The service was attentive and the misters were appreciated, but seriously ...the food was whatever.

Tortilla soup was bland. They tried to get creative and made pizza with lavash (a bread that Middle Easterners typically use to wrap vegetables/meat and/or eat with spread) but it was a fail. The cheese was too heavy and the toppings were cold on top which made for an unpleasant sensation. Also it was difficult to eat; the lavash just kept breaking apart.

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid! And spending most of my birthday dinners here as well. I love the upstairs patio! Amazing view of camelback mountain. This place will forever be in my heart!"}
{"text":"The food was fine but the waitress had too many tables and and the sandwich came long after our drinks were gone 20-30 min. we won't go back!"}
{"text":"Karaoke is completely biased to regulars. I got there at 8pm with an empty bar and requested 4 songs. I didn't get on til 11pm. Tried to talk to the dj about it and he ignore me. Strongly discourage others to come here."}
{"text":"Very good casual food... extensive, but not expensive, menu.  We had the chili con queso and the lavash with tomato and onion... both super yummy!  The bartenders are very nice.  The ambiance is either a great dark bar or you can eat upstairs outside and there are misters to keep you cool in the summer.  Gotta love being in the heart of OldTown!"}
{"text":"Location, location, location.  That is what this place's draw is.  They have a rooftop patio in Old Town.  Otherwise, eh.  They do have some half decent beers, and a few glasses of wine to choose from. We had the shrimp cocktail and the chips and salsa. These are both hard to mess up and were fine.. the chips could use some salt and the salsa tasted out of a jar though.   Downstairs is a hole in the wall karaoke bar.  But.. they have a rooftop patio and that is the draw."}
{"text":"The food was good, average, but good. Very large portions. Prepare to be full! But TERRIBLE service. My party of three had TWO of our orders messed up TWICE! If you're in the mood for getting your entrée before your salad, by all means, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This place has a ridiculous amount of potential! This outdoor restaurant's second floor overlooks the visitor-ridden streets of Old Town Scottsdale and nearby the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall which gives me plenty of fodder for people watching. We planned on relaxing here with an appetizer, drinks, and a late lunch.

Awful service by annoyed and tired looking workers. Everything was dirty: tables, chairs, silverware. Practically had to yell for our waitress for a second round after having empty glasses for too long until we realized it wasn't worth it. Got the check and booked it outta there after we finished our onion rings."}
{"text":"Stopped by to have a margarita.. the regular Texan Margarita was watery and tasteless, and the same frozen margarita was just blended and half filled with just froth from the blender; not a true frozen margarita.
Although many do like a traditional margarita, there are many of us who also like a proper frozen one too...
The nachos were straight out of a bag and a tin - we had to ask for jalapeños because the nachos came without them (WTF?) and extra salsa because it was as essentially just waved over it..
Disappointing really, on both beverages and food.."}
{"text":"Crowded. And one of those places were tipping the karoke DJ gets you bumped in the line. Which is lame. May as well make it pay per song. Considering how long we were there and the limited amount we got to sing, may as well go somewhere where the drinks are cheaper and we get to sing more than one song. Boooooooo"}
{"text":"Great location!  I had an amazing time at the Grapevine.  Karaoke is so much fun and the bar staff the MC all made it memorable.  The drinks were great and reasonably priced.  I would definitely come back, where are all the cool karaoke bars in Phoenix any ways??"}
{"text":"We stopped by on Sunday, 9/4/2016, looking for a few drinks and possibly an appetizer. We sat in the patio which was nice but there were too many flies (lol). I was ready to ask for a fly swat. Nachos was a ook, nothing special. They didn't have a variety of choices for adult beverage. Customer service was good, not exceptional."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

I had lunch here with a few of my colleagues, and I ordered the quesadilla and hot tea.  It was tasty, but nothing more. The restaurant is a good size, so it's perfect for groups. I couldn't really find anything here that is appropriate for vegetarians except for the side salad and quesadilla, so I can't give it more than 3.5. Great service though."}
{"text":"A very nice spot to have a drink if you are sitting on the upstairs balcony over looking Old Town. Not now of course during this monsoon .... but when the sun comes back. The food is average but good enough for nibblies. I would not eat an entire meal here again as I thought it was a little bland. The staff are excellent - super friendly and fast even when they are overwhelmed with customers."}
{"text":"Great location we just walked into to watch the game on the patio. Food was good. The bartender seemed annoyed but he was understaffed. Great place to chill but food and service is average."}
{"text":"Place is a little dumpy, but it has a rooftop, and on a sunny day in March is not bad. The music selection is garbage, food wasn't bad.  I got just the chicken wings, pretty good (whole wings). The service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Awesome upstairs with an outdoor but feels like indoor bar.  Good food with an expansive menu."}
{"text":"From the perspective of a karaoke aficionado:
I was there on a Friday during spring training. Karaoke started at 5, which is earlier than most places, and not too busy. Later it got packed and there didn't appear to be a structured singer rotation, but if you seemed to be skipped, you could remind the KJ and he was cool. Only problem I had is that I was unaware that if paying with credit card/bank card they automatically hold $50 in addition to your bill, which will be credited back later, (in my case it was 5 days later) just sucks if you're not expecting it. 
I would definitely come back next time I'm in Scottsdale. Karaoke was  fun, food was good, waitress and bartenders were attentive even when it was packed, I would just bring cash.
There were kids here earlier, not sure when or if it's a strict 21 and over policy."}
{"text":"Hostess sat us. 20 minutes later and no service. Girl bye. Now it's been 30 mins. Bye."}
{"text":"The restaurant part & upstairs area looked cute. You can come here to watch people karaoke while sipping on some drinks."}
{"text":"Where do I take my out of town guests who want to drink and watch other tourists drink and stare off the second story patio onto the milling crowd below? The Grapevine of course. The drinks were passable, the prices are tourist and the lavash is awesome. Lavash, that funny little unleaven bread makes a heavenly pizza with Delfino cheese. I highly suggest it. The drawback to the Grapevine is the service is what you would expect from the surly soft serve waiter at Dairy Queen and the prices are high. Reserve it for your older out of town guests, my inlaws loved it."}
{"text":"Stopped in at they Old Scottsdale establishment mid ride recently. Had a few beers in the upstairs roof bar. Great service and friendly staff. Learned from a local about their Pizzas!!! What a find. Very good and many people call in for take out. Super thin crispy crust and lots of choices for toppings. Not New York Pizza, not trying to be. These are great!

Going back soon!"}
{"text":"It's an over rated bar food place with a nice balcony overlooking Old Town scottsdale.  We ordered the Sicilian Lohvoush was cold and was not cooked through.  The cheese was not melted all the way.  We didn't say anything because my husband was past starving and he'd anything at that point. 

Sorrento with Shrimp and waterchestnuts Lohvoush

Fish and chips was average. 

I wouldn't rush back here for anything. 

Not worth the $56 we spent."}
{"text":"I was shopping a little on my 30th birthday in Old Town and I decided here to stop here (Feb. 4th) for lunch. My husband was at the Double Tree down the street at a trade show so I figured I would try to enjoy my day. I ate by the bar and had a wonderful conversation with the restaurant's manager Rose. She had an outstanding personality and actually got me through this bittersweet day, as all my friends are back in RI and I was sort of having a lonely 30th. I had the roast beef sandwich with the au jous sauce, salad and fries. I also had a glass of riesling (my personal favorite). And as Rose and I were talking about the difficulties of relocation I mentioned it was my birthday- no not to get anything for free. But I was treated to another glass of wine on the house and a slice of cheesecake. She did tell me that she does not work on Saturdays- sorry to other Yelpers who had bad customer service- she did tell me about Karokee but my singing days are over. I would definitely go back for lunch again just because I was treated so well."}
{"text":"I came here for a couple drinks-  the old men in our Spring Training Party like this place, I suspect because it was right near our hotel."}
{"text":"Dive bar, but the rooftop patio saves it. Food was moderate. I had the Caesar salad and thought it was very good for the price."}
{"text":"The surly older waitress was a huge bummer.  I realize we weren't all arriving at the same time or leaving at the same time, but we were drinking cocktails in the middle of the day on a week day.  Wouldn't most waitresses see that as a great way to get a bigger tip?  Come by more often, bring more expensive alcoholic drinks, offer to take food orders every now and then to keep us there and drinking longer, and for GODS sake, pretend to be nice.  Seriously - she was awful.  It was clear that she couldn't have cared less that we were there.  And the food was sub par.  My turkey club was a wrap with some turkey, bacon, and lettuce in it.  The cheese was melted on top to make it look like it was a burrito, and there was some canned salsa on the side, for about $11.  No fries or chips or fruit....really?  Some of the reviews make it sound like the dive bar to go to at night....I love dive bars so maybe I'd try it again, but that's a big maybe."}
{"text":"Out here for Spring Training and it has amazing food and a great atmosphere. There's a really nice outdoor sitting area during the day and for food, I would definitely recommend the Lahvosh, it is amazing! Sandwiches are really good, too! Haven't seen the night life here, but it's a great place during the day for food and drinks."}
{"text":"Don't come here before 10 pm on a Friday night unless you want to listen to old ladies singing oldies songs. We were a fun group that stopped in at 8:30ish to listen to some karaoke, and it was a disaster. A bunch of blue hairs reliving their glory days and terrorizing the ears of everyone in the restaurant. I'll come back here when I'm 60. The service was also pretty bad, I remember looking back to find out server and just saw her sitting at the bar top doing nothing. On a Friday night in a bar? Really lady?"}
{"text":"I must say, this place had me immediately! We were fleeing the cold of the Midwest to take a Mini Babymoon while I was still expecting. My husband had been here before and we parked as soon as he recognized the place. So glad he did!

The layout is nice because you have a rowdy bar area in the back, a laid back front resto area and a top outdoor patio/deck area. It was instantly obvious that we were from a colder climate! We chose the outdoor deck and felt fine after dark in February with just a light jacket. 

We got two different kinds of Lavash, which is sort of like a thin cracker crust pizza. I don't think it was just the pregnancy cravings, it was delicious. We started with the Seafood Ceviche, which it most like a Seafood Salsa. Again, just so tasty!

The waitress was prompt, friendly and made a good local brew suggestion to my husband. Would stop back here again!"}
{"text":"We just stopped in for a drink, went upstairs to the middle bar, which is covered but people still smoke. There was a distinct smell of vomit along with the cloud of smoke - and people were still eating there! The bartender was friendly and the drinks were fine but the place just seemed dirty and run-down. They do have tons of room and there's even karaoke downstairs."}
{"text":"For a place called \"Grapevine\" I'd expect the wine menu to be at least decent.  I have gone to this place several times for food, drinks AND karaoke - I enjoy the view from the upstairs patio (I highly recommend sitting there).  I must admit that service every time I dine, is slow at best.  It wasn't just me though, this last time I watched the frustration of another table with a different server.   

I think the location is fantastic and the building itself is great!  I would do an overhaul on the menus (drink, wine and food) and concentrate on the quality of food being served and food presentation.  I'm sure this place isn't hurting but I know it has some real potential to be AMAZING.  As it stands, it's only ok at best."}
{"text":"Grapevine: because I have had one-out-of-three okay experiences here, I will give you a three star.. but I really feel like you are still a 2...

I forgot what a mistake the nachos were. In fact, the bartender served them with chili, and when me and Mr. Gold kindly explained we are vegetarians and do not eat chili, he scoffed and gave us the worst case of stink eye I have ever experienced. I'm sorry, if I am paying nine god damned dollars for some nachos, they better be right.

Granted it was a busy Saturday night, but the service was not good. It took forever to get a drink even though I was sitting at the bar. And again, that nasty douche bag of a waiter was such a prick. Ummm.. HELLO... I am buying shit from you and your freaking tip is going to depend on your attitude. 

The one completely redeeming thing about The Grapevine is that the karaoke is pretty awesome. Pretty much everyone back in the pit sings along, so it really becomes like one big group voice ringing out in the night.

Let me give some of you a piece of advice, though... don't select songs that are downers that will make me want to slit my wrists. ESPECIALLY if you cannot sing. That is just NOT fair."}
{"text":"their chicken strips are not fried and are healthy.

their shrimp cocktail offered large, delicious shrimps.

happy hr prices are $4.50 for apps and $4 margaritas.

the blonde waitress that works downstairs in the afternoons is very professional and amiable."}
{"text":"Service was quite bad.  Had to ask for a glass for my beer, and shrimp cocktail was served to me without the usual crackers and a fork..Asked several times but had to go to kitchen to get my own fork and crackers.  Very loud atmosphere.  Filled with people who \"tried\" to sing.  I do not appreciate listening to people singing off key.  Was quite grating to the ears.  If you are that bad then stay home and sing in your bathroom and do not subject others to these obnoxious sounds.  More of a cowboy saloon type of establishment.  Does not fit into the Scottsfale scene at all.  More of a type of place you would find in the Southwest valley. They need to change this place into a more upscale place so that people will want to go here.  GET RID OF THE KARAOKE!!!!!"}
{"text":"How 'bout the KJ and those harmonica skills, y'all? 

The karaoke area was teeny tiny, and clearly us amateurs (besides Kelly S, of course) were cramping the style of some more serious singers. There were some folks you could tell are anxiously waiting for The Voice auditions to roll through Scottsdale.

I liked that they would still serve you outside of the main bar area, because what a pain for me to get up and walk the five steps to the bar. Seriously, it was a nice treat, and our girl took great care of us despite how rowdy we were. Also, the restrooms were pristine!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok. And I mostly say this because of the service that was provided; it was very slow. We sat down on the rooftop (which was nice) and we did not receive a greeting or drinks for a very long time. When we did, our waitress dropped out water off and didn't come back to take our actual orders for at least 20 minutes or so. We were starving! What makes matters worse is they charge a 20% gratuity for over six people (we had three adults and three children) and she wasn't worth that much. Once we were able to order, I ordered the Scottsdale Salad with salmon. I was pleased with this meal; it was flavorful, just the right amount of ingredients and the cut of salmon was thick and perfectly cooked. Everyone else ordered salads as well and they were also pretty good. If I'm ever back in Scottsdale, I'd order it again!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great karaoke environment awesome place. Cheesecake is bomb!"}
{"text":"2.25 Stars rounded down.  Like when your pencil needs sharpened and it's not much more than a nubbin.  Rounded down.  #2 pencil.  

Food was serviceable no more.  Nickel and dimeing going on too.

There was some heavy duty karaoke action going on in the bar.  Does the word \"wail\" mean anything to you?  If it does do it with pride.

Atmosphere with inside/outside seating is OK.  Plenty of misters as well as plenty of Mrs."}
{"text":"I went specifically for the karaoke and the fact that my underage son could go with. We both live singing and we very excited.  I show up on a Wednesday and its LOUD. Overly so. I ordered a drink and sat down. I went up to talk to the karaoke host. He barely smiled and greeted me. I asked him if he had anything else that was not in his book. He asked me what I was looking for. I told him, and he says, \" oh yeah.. No. I don't have that one. Your not the only one that has asked about it though. I'm about 3 years behind right now.\"  I checked through the rest of the book, which was about 65% country, 30% OLD, and 5% newer. This place is toyed as a karaoke bar!!! 7 days a week and the selection is ancient!
I asked the waitress for my check to pay for The drink. She brought me another drink! I corrected her and she brought me my $10 tab for a single drink on a WEDNESDAY!! 
Overall atmosphere was not good. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"I have been their twice for Karaoke. They have an AMAZING book I was shocked to see how many songs they had. I signed up for 3 and I could only sing one of them because the other songs had bad words in them.
That was a big NO NO! IT IS A BAR! YOU HAVE TO BE 21 TO BE IN THERE! who is going to be offended by me singing adam sandlers at a medium pace?"}
{"text":"Went here almost 20 yrs ago so I had to go back while visiting Scottsdale this Christmas. The lahvosh is still amazing...a must try!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great atmosphere to hang out with friends and enjoy the view! Had a wonderful waitress and food was amazing! Had the lavosh I think it is called, was awesome! Never had anything like it before! Very enjoyable evening overall on the second floor patio!
Would definitely return and recommend to others.  The only thing is I would go when the weather permits and it is cool outside. But, loved it!!"}
{"text":"Grapevine has the best Karaoke system in Arizona and it runs EVERY night after 5pm. They have another cute bar upstairs that's covered but open-air and allows for smoking and conversation. They also have a huge upstairs patio for dining which tends to be very popular during the winter months. Grapevine is a fun place to hang out - not a culinary adventure. While the food is decent it certainly wont impress Yelpers. However, the atmosphere in general, the staff, and the late night Karaoke are perfect."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat at a fancy place, but no time on a Saturday night.  Was disappointing to end up here with mediocre food and service.

We were warned about karaoke night, but the singers were ok, so it was tolerable. 

Good place for lunch maybe, but not on a date..  At least not inside.  Maybe on a cooler night on the patio."}
{"text":"Greatness. Been sitting on top deck eating lahvosh for 25 years. Great location in the heart of old town. Lunch or dinner is great - casual."}
{"text":"A friend celebrated their 30th birthday on a Saturday night here but we all left severely disappointed. The night started with a bug at the bottom of my 'Perfect Margarita'. I never send food or drinks back but for this reason I was forced to. I let the waitress know about the fly and asked for a bottle and or can of any domestic beer. She said \"Coors Lite alright?\" I responded \"That'll be good, thank you!\" And then she walked away... There was no apology for the bug in the drink, no look of embarrassment, nothing. So, 30 minutes later out walks the waitress holding a GLASS of Coors Lite... Not a bottle or can like I'd asked. (If they didn't have any bottled or canned beer I assumed she would have mentioned when I first requested but I didn't want to cause a scene so I politely accepted the glass of Coors)  I didn't order food for fear of uncleanliness.

The night went on, the birthday girl put in her name for karaoke, we laughed and enjoyed ourselves until almost 2 hours later her name was called. No one else was able to sing karaoke due to the long wait time.  

The waitress was rude, other employees walked around with mean mugs and gossiped amongst themselves about customers within ear shot!

The place was absolutely filthy and decor is outdated.

Other friends in the group were severely disappointed with their food and mixed drinks and all agreed we would absolutely never return."}
{"text":"Food was only average. Karaoke was ridiculous. If you want to sing here don't plan on it. Three hour my husband and my friend husband waited to singing there were people that sang 5 and six times before they sang at all.someone need to teach them how-to run karaoke. the waitress was in such a hurry to  give us our bill she didn't bother to ask  if we need as anything else  before giving us our check. I would of continued to have my margaritas while I was,waiting for them to sing, but if they weren't in hurry to serve me anything wasn't in a,hurry to continue to spend my money there."}
{"text":"Wonderful view & relaxed atmosphere on the upstairs balcony seating. Fun & delicious specialty drink menu. I enjoyed the wedge salad, which isn't a unique dish, of course, but expertly prepared & fabulous! My husband had the gyro, which was also tasty & well prepared. Friendly staff, tee shirts worn have directions to the restroom on the back of them, Funny!!!"}
{"text":"I am actually between a 3 and a 4 star rating here.  I've been to Grapevine several times, and have always had a pleasant dining experience.  The ambiance is cute but casual, they have extensive patio dining, and a second bar area upstairs (covered) with more patio tables available.  The food is pretty good, and portion sizes are generous.  My favorite is the French Dip sandwich....it's simple, and tastes delicious.  What I am not as much a fan of is the Karaoke scene at night.  I actually LOVE karaoke, and the first time I went here I was excited to get up in front of an energetic audience and blast my way through some 80's pop song or another.  But apparently there are politics involved at The Grapevine when you want to sing.  The karaoke mistress runs the show with an iron fist, and only allows those that pay a small mortgage the opportunity to show their stuff.  Even if some drunkard has commandiered the mic for the last three songs, if he's paid the piper he will continue to blow out your eardrums....regardless of how many other people are waiting for their chance.  Definitely not how most karaoke places are run, and I wasn't a fan of it.  I've been back a few times since, and have experienced the same thing with the same karoake lady, so I know it wasn't just a fluke.  Too bad, the place is nice, but for karaoke I'll probably head north to Ernies..."}
{"text":"We came here for a night out during a bachelorette party weekend. The only good thing I can say is that the karaoke is so much fun and honestly hilarious.

The service was horrible. Our waitress was rude and short with us. We wanted to order food and we hadn't seen her in quite awhile so someone went to the hostess stand and the girl snapped at her! So rude!

When we finally did get our pizzas they weren't even cut properly. We were literally just tearing chunks off because neither one was actually sliced.

Overall, I'd say if you're looking for a fun night out, sure this place works but don't order food and keep your expectations pretty low."}
{"text":"I took Wendy last night to have a dinner to a place that I found in Scottsdale rd  from google and was so sad  we were nice dressed and pretties but one mesera no's trato so bad she though that Wendy was drunk for the way she' was walking ? and push me out she said I'm not going to give you any drink   and you need to get out from my place ladies  and we were just at the door I was so mad  I called her bitch many times I talk to the manager and many people was watching so bad Wendy was sad  we went back home  so please if you want to go instagram whatever it is media please write a bad review that wasn't right she push me and I said don't touch me bitch you r so stupid and we left ::: so this is the place name and was around 11pm  SORRY FOR MY VOCABULARY but I'm still so mad that's not right my sister have medical issues after her accident and surgeries she's not available to walk right and this people from this place though that she probably was drunk and push me out from the door. So that was so rude and totally wrong I will tell my whole family and friends don't go there and probably because we are Latin people they treated us so bad.... I talk to the manager or owner and she didn't done anything that people don't know anything  about business and are very unprofessional.....SO sad. And you guys don't deserve any star I just picked one to write this out."}
{"text":"Came for a drink and an app but wrong place. Service was as bad as the karaoke. Don't come here unless you are drunk and ready to sing."}
{"text":"I'm always game for an adventure. Add in the mix of getting to know fellow Yelp Community Ambassadors from other cities and I'm TOTALLY DOWN - even Karaoke, which happens to be my nemesis. 

Yeah. I'll admit. I'm not a fan of Karaoke. Don't get me wrong - I love watching other people sing. I personally don't enjoy doing it. 

So when Scott C, an avid (and fantastic!) karaoker (is that a word?) asked if we were up for it, we went along. A local suggested The Grapevine and off we went on those motorized and overpriced golf-carts. 

Walking in I noticed a foul stench coming from the ladies restroom and a line extending deep into the back. We had to squeeze our way to the back karaoke room and somehow, like a Yelp miracle, we found ourselves a table and chairs. 

Boy did Scott C hit the nail on the head. I sucked down my beer anxiously awaiting the performance of Scott C. I knew it would be epic. I knew it would be legendary. I didn't know it would take freaking FOREVER. That Grand Master or whatever you call him was a total douche. There's absolutely no reason why someone should have to wait almost two hours to do Karaoke. That's just terrible!

At one point I went into the bathroom and walked into two boys mopping up a vile mess. They apologized and said they'd be done in a minute. When they were I opened a stall and found out they indeed were NOT. Vomit covered the stall door, bathroom seat, and just about every other square inch of the place. Yikes!

I suppose Grapevine has its \"type\" - lesson learned."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go on a night out, hands down! The decor is that of your typical no-fuss bar, but what it lacks in pzazz it makes up for with great karaoke! 

I'm a sucker for any chance to belt a good Britney Spears track to adoring fans, and this is my favorite place to do it. The atmosphere is inviting and attracts singing drinkers and drunk singers of all types, making for a night of great variety and roof-raisin'. 

Drinks are good and fairly priced and the staff has always been professional if not down-right friendly. Hit the bar with me next time and we can sing a duet."}
{"text":"This email serves as a public apology to all Grape Vine Karaoke Regulars:

I apologoze that a bussload of 30 somethings gals came rolling into your bar and caused all sorts of drunken havoc on your night.  It was my bachelorette party and I just really wanted to sing.  I sang, I think and I have pictures of us all singing, just no real memory of the singing.  Anyhow--- I THINK WE HAD A GREAT TIME!"}
{"text":"I'm torn on what to rate The Grapevine. I've had several good nights here and some not so good. It usually gets a great crowd for karaoke that sings along to every song.  This can be a problem though because the rotation gets so large you may never get to sing. I've sat for two hours without being called. We have learned the best way to get your song played is to tip the host $20. That usually will get you one song. It's become a little ridiculous. 

I've eaten here probably twice and I can't remember anything about the food. So that means it wasn't bad or good enough to remember. Passable. 

Service by the cocktail waitress with the short platinum hair was actually stellar last time we were there. Normally it's impossible to find someone that is interested in helping anyone. So props to the pixie cut woman, I apologize for not getting your name. Drinks are pretty dependable here, so the bartenders have been consistent. If it hadn't been for the improved service and actually getting to sing last time I would have done only two stars."}
{"text":"If I was simply reviewing the service & food I would be at around 2 stars.....it's not that great.  But why 4 stars you ask? Karaoke my friend, if you haven't been to The Grapevine on a Saturday night for Karaoke you are missing out.  I thoroughly embarrassed my self last weekend and I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Grapevine loses a star for CENSORSHIP! A few of us hit them up after the Elite event tonight and they cut my song off because it had the F word in it. REALLY? Stopped it mid-song and asked me to pick another one.

But then Richard Z was allowed to sing \"I want your Sex\", which is waaayyy dirtier (and he did a fab job BTW), and he didn't get cut off. What's the deal? If you don't want songs with bad words to be sung, then take them out of your songbook. Don't make a big deal about it and make me seem like a jerk because the song writer likes to drop the f-bomb.

Don't bother with this place for Karaoke. 2 bad experiences makes this place low on my list and not worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I think it's safe to say I absolutely love this place! I really like how the crowd is so diverse with people ranging from their 20s - 60s+ so I can come here with my girlfriends or my parents! Karaoke is so much fun and the crowd is always super friendly. I recommend trying the chicken wings, they are HUGE and delicious. I feel the drinks are reasonably priced and the service is good. Always a good time here!!! Also - no cover!"}
{"text":"Okay, that is one star too many. Great potential on the karaoke as they have it every night. But good luck getting into the rotation. We sat for 2 hours and never did get called. The place was packed but groups coming in well after us got in and some that already sang were going up for their 3rd song. The sound system is baaad, excessively loud accented by an annoying screeching pitch. Yes, some of that would be the singers:) If you want to actually sing without some drunk spilling a drink on you, save yourself the aggravation and head on down the road."}
{"text":"What an odd little place. I will admit, I was not sober upon entering. And yes, I did buy more drinks. I ordered two whiskeys on the rocks and they were good pours for decent prices.

Music selection for karaoke was okay. They didn't have quite as much as I had hoped for. Nearly no Kanye West, and sometimes, white girls just need to rap.

I did however manage to get there around 1:15am and was able to sing a song before they closed at 2.

Another downside was the other patrons. People so drunk that they couldn't handle not getting in the middle of EVERYONE ELSE'S SONGS. It's fine to sing along if you know it, but don't stand there and try to sing into my microphone while I'm doing a duet of \"Mr. Roboto\" with my soulmate. GTFO of my facespace.

A random man, very gay, also tried to get with a male friend of ours who is very straight. My hot blonde best friend eventually sat on his lap and still this gay man did not get the hint. Don't get me wrong, I love the gays, but no matter who you are, you shouldn't be forcing yourself on someone who clearly doesn't want it. Male or female.

Come to think of it, a bouncer would have really come in handy in this situation. Fail, Grapevine. Fail."}
{"text":"For the most part, the Grapevine has barely passable food.  HOWEVER thier cheeseburgers are absolutely DEVUBE.  Hand molded, tender, juicy and presented on a whole wheat bun with a dijon mayonnaise and a yummy side of fries.  It really is ridiculously good.   Also, thier patio rules!  It boasts a commanding view of Camelback and you can see the goings on on the street below.    It is great to go for lunch or sunset and If you are a sports fan, they have a few big screen tv's."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  Every time I can get into Scottsdale I try to stop by The Grapevine.  They have fabulous food (I love the fish over the jalapeno hummus with the cheesy pita bread) but all of the food I have tried there has been great.  My favorite part is second story outdoor patio.  The lighting is nice in the evening and it is fun to watch the city be busy.  I also highly recommend the drink called the Persian if you like vodka and cucumbers.  I could sit and drink those all night - except then I would need a cab!

Most recently I took my family (a party of 10) there for dinner.  There was something on the menu for everyone's tastebuds - even the kids!  Everyone thanked me for bringing them there as they all loved it and told me that they would be coming back.

I have yet to check out the Karaoke (although it was packed each time we were there for dinner) but that's because we are not big karaoke people.  I really do love the food, the atmosphere, and the drinks.  The staff is super friendly too.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten here, I have just been for karaoke and drinks a couple of times.  The whole place needs a major upgrade.  The karaoke area is small and cramped, and the place just feels old.  When I went this past weekend, it was annoying because they don't run the karaoke in the order of submission.  We were there for 2 hours before anyone from our group was called, while other people walked in and were called 20 minutes later.  That's not cool.  Also, the music is soooooo loud on some songs that it's hard to hear the person singing.  And it is especially too loud when the KJ starts playing that damned harmonica during a song.  This is karaoke, not his time to shine.  The poor guy trying to sing over that loud-ass harmonica just stopped trying to sing altogether.  Someone needs to tell him to pipe down.  The harmonica adds a nice touch, but he doesn't have to be all up in the microphone with it.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant? The Grapevine kind of like a mullet, if you shaved the front of your head. There's no business in the front, and the party is definitely in the back. 

Show up on a Wednesday and you'd think the place was closed, until you walk to the back bar and discover a big crowd of regulars and quite a few weirdos from out of town (that'd be us) rocking out with some karaoke. There's some serious talent in the room, but don't be intimidated if your voice is as bad as mine. It's not about the vocals, it's all about the performance. 

I saw a girl with no talent at all...I mean, she should be ashamed of herself (Katie I'm talking to you)...but she brought the house down with her antics on the mic. I personally subscribe to the theory that it's better that people assume you suck at karaoke than if you open your mouth and remove all doubt, but good for you, Katie. 

Come out, have a few beers, and enjoy the show."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch and they actually suggested we sit on the upper deck patio. Um...its 110 outside. Why would you even have staff up there? Food was horrible and outdated. Ive had the Reuben here and it was delicious but had the \"asian\" salad this time and I can't even tell you how horrible it was. Our server Tiffany was super nice but this place sucks."}
{"text":"it's been a while since the one and only time i went here, but it deserves a review, simply because of what happened there.

we were well on our way to having a hang over the next day, which seems like the only way to go to this bar. 

we walked in (group of 6), and managed to find a table, inside, where the karaoke was happening. we're not that into karaoke, but it is free entertainment.

as soon as we sat down, a woman started singing. she was pretty decent and the song was a crowd pleaser. then it happened.

some dude, about 5'2\" gets up on stage, and starts dancing at her, while she's singing. i say at, because she was not dancing. no one was. except this guy, who was also in his mid-40s and sporting a sweet comb-over. it was seriously like someone planted him as a prank, like we were being taped for a surprise tv show. 

we all sat there looking at each other, then looking at him, then back at each other. the lady was a trooper, she just kept singing. finally, the song was over, and he opened his arms up, like he was going to hug her. finally, some other guy from the audience, pulled him away, back down to his seat. very awkwardly. 

that's not why i'm giving this 2 starts. we were there a good 15 minutes total, and never saw a server. more beer might have saved the situation, in some way. with no beer in sight, we bolted. we couldn't handle another episode like that, with nothing to wash it down with."}
{"text":"I never tried their food here but I came here twice for a karaoke night. Takes forever to sing since it's always packed. Spent lots of money tips in able for me to sing before others. I was like 40 out of 45. I probably gave like $25 tips in total just so he can bump me up to sing beforehand and I felt like it was too big but I'm generous anyway when it comes to tips. Good experience though and bartender was nice! Good price for drinks as well. Nice area, good vibrance. Upper second level was very nice. Good for dates and meeting with friends for drinks. I liked it!"}
{"text":"My only recommendations as far as Grapevine goes are the following. READ THESE VERY CAREFULLY!

1.) Eat before you come. DO NOT EAT HERE! The food is absolutely terrible. I ordered potato skins sans bacon and fried shrimp. The potato skins were absolutely slathered with a glob of processed tasting cheese and dripping with oil. The shrimp was wretched as well. When I bit into it, grease shot into my mouth and it's literally all I could taste. It. Is. BAD! The rest of my friends were disappointed with their food as well- one ordered gnocci pasta and it looked abysmal. Also, this was some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Once we sat ourselves, it took our waitress more than 30 minutes to notice we existed and to maybe come take our freaking food & drink orders. Getting her attention for refills the rest of the night was a huge hassle as well.
2.) Come for the karaoke only. Their catalog is insanely big and the crowd on a Friday night is extremely enthusiastic and fun. Some talented singers in the bunch too!
3.) Bring Clorox wipes or Purelle to \"anoint\" the mic before you use it. This is VERY important! Approximately TWO days after my karaoke adventure here (in which me & my girl group sang three songs) I came down with a vicious illness- coughing, body aches, sore throat and then laryngitis. I have no doubt where I got it from- the skanky microphones at this dive joint! All but ONE of my four girlfriends also got sick with a similar virus two days later. Unfortunately mine was the most severe. Don't take the chance- sanitize that germ-laden mic before you sing!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch with my husband  while we were in old town. After having my bland chicken sandwich, with soggy lettuce and trying my husbands ruben we were well disappointed. It was nothing special. Mediocre at best. My husband was complaining the rest of the day that the food wasn't sitting right with him. 
As for the service, it wasn't bad. She was pretty attentive. We sat outside on the patio which was nice, but in need of an update. I stopped inside to use the restroom, it had more of a bar feel then a restaurant, which would explain the bar quality food."}
{"text":"we are are on an quest to rank the Top Ten Chocolate Cakes in Old Town Scottsdale.
this was the first place we tried and we were quite happy with the patio and service staff was very friendly.

The chocolate cake was tasty.

The excitement of initiating our quest made this a great experience!

The ranking is based solely on our mission for Chocolate Cake.

{"text":"Food is terrible! Tried this place a 2nd time and was very disappointed. Will never eat here again! Left with an awful taste in my mouth. Worst dinner I've ever had in old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"people eat at the grapevine?
the only people i know go to the grapevine for karaoke and drinks.
the \"host\" with his fiddle is priceless.  it's especially great when you don't even know it's coming and he just joins in your song!
this place is great - the people watching is amazing ... especiially mr. dancing queen (he shows up late!)

highly recommended ... just dont take our table! :)"}
{"text":"This place does not look like much more than a run down restaurant from the outside, but inside, evenings, it is karaoke heaven.  Karaoke seven nights per week, in the bar, and it's usually packed.  

The Karaoke DJ here is a little more aggressive than at other places, and will get people singing even against their will.  He has a great, wide assortment of songs, old and new.  The crowd the evening we went seemed to prefer country.  Maybe it's always this way here. 

Definitely a dive bar, and I was the only sober one there, as I was not drinking.  Lots of fun people watching.  Karaoke is better when everyone is intoxicated."}
{"text":"I effing LOVE this place! 

Sure, that's the beer talking. But that's exactly what I told the person who appeared to be the owner as I stumbled out of this dive karaoke bar after last call on a Saturday night. 

The place was dirty, it was packed, and it was loud. And it was a ton of fun. Everyone was singing. There was just a lot of great energy. Not to mention, fantastic Phoenix people watching.

This is the kind of joint that I would only consider getting beer in bottles. Fortunately they had a decent selection. All the good ones seemed to be about five bucks a pop, which was fine by me.

I was happy to buy a couple rounds while I waited to sing Surrender by Cheap Trick. And when it was my turn, I rocked it. 

Man, that was fun. Best night of team building. Ever."}
{"text":"A legit hybrid dive/Karaoke/people watching bar. If those are your expectations.. You will not be disappointed.. if you want White glove VIP service.. I must ask.. where in the world of old Scottsdale would you ever think that existed.. Uber up the road to the W or something"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night for kareoke. Nice that they had kareoke on a Friday night, usually places only do it during the week. But it is a kareoke bar .. The song selection was diverse even had some Spanish songs, but no Ramon Ayala - guess it would be going too far he he he .. As a group ordered wings ( so big and hot yummy), chilli nachos  ( yuck, burned chips, not melted cheese and the chilli  tasted like plastic ), chicken quesadilla was my favorite. The staff was nice and friendly and the crowd was amusing. Everyone into having a good time. The regulars were hilarious. Yes, I would come again, yes I would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Karaoke. That is the reason to go here. To listen to karaoke or sing it. This Old Town bar has been here for over a decade and little about this place has changed. There are of course the karaoke regulars and then a mix of tourists and small groups out for a random karaoke night out. The relatively small karaoke room is usually always busy while the rest of the place is basically empty. 

A seasonal exception to the back room karaoke being the only busy spot is the second level patio bar. This area is intermittently open during the winter/spring tourist season. I have enjoyed a beer with a view after nearby Giants Spring Training game."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  Lacey was the best and recommended the Lavosh Sorrento pizza; blew us away it was so freaking good!!!!  Go to the top deck and have fun!!!   Tell them Bob sent you!!!!"}
{"text":"so sad... actually real sad. people having sex by the front door and the staff ok with it March 25, 2017 - check the security tape. The worst karaoke dj in all az. Yes they cater to the regulars and demand $20 tip from anyone else and you MIGHT get a chance to sing but horrible manners.  The Karoke gear is dirty as whores crotch , and very old, the playlist old, the music quality sucks. Loud doesnt make it sound better. Ever heard of a sound check ? The decibel rating on a meter at 116,  when 86 would make everyone sound much better. The food is horrible and you probably will get sick. the bathrooms always dirty and nothing is ever CLEANED, just wiped down with a wet rag that is used over and over again. A visit from the city health department is on its way. So much potential but so poorly managed and sad."}
{"text":"y'all racist for kicking mexican women out and a disabled woman out. DONT EAT HERE OR ELSE."}
{"text":"This is a fairly large restaurant, as it has a dive bar inside, a downstairs patio area, and an upstairs bar and rooftop seating.  It's unfortunate that the food and service were sub-standard.  I'm not sure if it was our group of 12 that made the service lacking, but it wasn't busy at all for a Wednesday night and the service was rather slow.  The food was lacking as well.  The hummus was okay - flavor wasn't as potent as typical hummus.

Prices are fair, but this place is probably one of the worse dining venues in Old Town Scottsdale.  The other one would be Italian Grotto."}
