{"text":"I enjoyed this wonderful Vietnamese place. The food was unique and very tasty. The spring rolls and peanut sauce were fabulous!"}
{"text":"A new Vietnamese Pho restaurant across from the Cannery Resort Casino on Graig. This area is booming with interesting shops n eateries. I m sure Pho Mai Mai will do well in this busy intersection. Unfortunately I m not quite a fan of their food and their portion sizes r much smaller than most other. Since growing up in the Bay Area, I m used to all the wonderful Vietnamese Pho places from San Jose n Oakland. PMM is a new business, hope they'll improve in flavor n service in time. It is always nice to see a new Pho shop open outside of Chinatown."}
{"text":"Great pho place!! Highly recommend the chicken wings, beef tendon pho, and avocado smoothie. The service is super friendly and quick, will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Not the best food quality, great if you're in a hurry tho. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that has had  good pho or viet dishes."}
{"text":"Was going to five guys and saw this new place and deciced to give it a try taro slushi delicious beef pho delicious and banh mi delicious"}
{"text":"THE SHORT STORY: Highly recommended - delicious, extremely satisfying food; friendly service; clean restaurant.  THE DETAILS: I live in SoCal, not too far from Little Saigon, and have been married to a (lovely, beautiful, kind-hearted) Vietnamese woman for over 16 years.  I mention this to provide some context - I know Vietnamese food very well and have eaten at many of the best restaurants in Little Saigon, as well as Saigon, Viet Nam. I also have the great pleasure and good fortune to eat delicious, home-made Vietnamese food every week at home.  I have extended family in North Vegas and they took me, my wife, and my teenage kids to Pho Mai Mai on our last trip.  The restaurant is nice and clean, with a lot of windows and natural light.  The staff was friendly, and we were seated immediately.  (We came early because we heard this place was very popular and can be crowded during the main eating hours.)  My wife and kids ordered pho and I ordered my all-time favorite - vermicelli bowl with grilled pork and egg rolls.  My reaction after the first bite - OH MY GOD!!  It was SO DELICIOUS!! I couldn't believe that this random place in North Las Vegas could make the best grilled pork I have ever tasted!  It was total flavor heaven!  The veggies were fresh and clean, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the egg rolls were scrumptious!  Wow, great job Pho Mai Mai!!  Oh, and the fish sauce that comes with the vermicelli bowls was perfect.  If you're afraid of trying \"fish\" sauce like I was many years ago, trust me - it doesn't taste like fish at all.  It's wonderful.  Mix a little chili sauce into it and pour it all over!  I tasted my wife's pho and it was also delicious.  The unique pho spices were very noticeable, unlike some other places. The flavor was complex and very enjoyable.  I'm not a big \"soup\" person so I usually don't order pho for myself, but after tasting my wife's bowl I wanted more!  She was very impressed with it as well and really loved the flavor and the quality.  She's great at making pho herself, so it's a real accomplishment to impress her.  By the way, when she tasted my grilled pork her face lit up and she had an OMG moment as well.  THE NEXT DAY: We went back the next day and I had the banh mi sandwich with grilled pork.  WOW, it was INCREDIBLE!  It was literally like flavor ecstasy!  They have really created a magical flavor in that grilled pork.  The bread was toasted perfectly - it was thin and crunchy on the outside, and soft and fluffy on the inside.  The veggies were fresh and they created a nice balance to the bread and meat.  The sandwiches were so awesome that we stopped by on our way out the next day to pick some up for the drive home.  Oh yah, make sure to order the iced coffee, too.  It's the best I've ever had at a restaurant or café, second only to my wife's at home!"}
{"text":"Love that there's a pho place near home where we can always go to to satisfy our cravings. We come here for dinner around 1800 and it's not that busy. I heard they're pretty busy around lunch time. The owner and staff are such nice people. The moment you come in, they immediately greet you and asks if you're dining in or out. While browsing their menu, one guy gives water and after a bit, asks for your order. The wait time is great. Our food was ready after 5-10 mins. Food was delicious! Just as you would expect in a pho place. Springs rolls are to die for, soup was great, rice menu was even better, vermicelli is super delicious. We added taro and avocado boba with our orders and they didn't disappoint us. The problem is the servings are pretty small (or we're just really hungry) haha. Love this place."}
{"text":"We had lunch at this place and thought it was overpriced fir the amount of meat in their dishes. We started with the veggie spring rolls which was tasteless. All it had in it was a little lettuce and noodles. No carrots, mint or other veggies. I had the pork and egg roll vermicelli which included a dipping sauce. Very little pork was in it and no broth. My friend had the chicken pho which he said was okay. We also had the pineapple fried rice which was bland. I doubt we will come back."}
{"text":"One of the struggles in living in N Las Vegas is the fact that there aren't many good quality restaurants other than larger fast food chains. Thank GOD for Pho Mai Mai for opening this location on this side of town!  Walking in, it was the peak of lunch time & almost every table was filled. The confusing part was if you are going to be seated or if you choose your own seats. The gentleman who worked there told us to grab any available table area. The menu was a pretty good size having the usual items: Pho soup, vermicelli bowls, rice plates, etc.  This was our order:  Bo Bun Hue/Spicy Beef Broth w/ Noodle (3/5): If you have had this specific type of soup before, you WILL be disappointed. The picture on the menu & what you actually get are two different things. Usually, Bo Bun Hue is more of a richer broth & tends to be more spicy compared to regular Pho. The broth looked like they added some type of spice oil to regular Pho broth, it did not look rich at all. Also, it was not spicy and the noodles were thicker & looked like spaghetti with the consistency of udon. It was weird... BUT nonetheless even though it was not Bo Bun Hue at all, the dish DID taste good. Well-Done Brisket Pho (4.5/5): I must say.. their broth is VERY good. The brisket was nice and fatty & there was a good soup to noodle ratio. You know the Pho is good when you don't have to add ANYTHING to give the broth flavor. Only wish is that they would add more meat.. i feel like they kind of short-changed me here. Combination Fried Rice (5/5): Just like the name states, all the meats including shrimp in fried rice. Very tasty & a pretty good serving. However their cook their meat in the fried rice, I need to know because it had a lot of flavor!  Pretty good when I'm craving pho on the North side & don't feel like going all the way to Spring Mtn or my favorite Vietnamese place. Only concern in the service be more efficient. Had to ask several times for extra tableware for my 2 yr old & the cashier was a kid on his phone all day. There was also a table nearby that wasn't bussed the whole time we were there. And the price isn't TOO bad, but I've been to multiple Pho places where they'll charge $1 or so less for a BIGGER bowl of soup. Will definitely be back, though because the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great place for pho, my husband and I come here often. Fast service the egg rolls are delish, I wouldn't order the wings though. The pork sandwich is also fantastic."}
{"text":"I love the food, the price is reasonable and the turnaround time is quick. The staff and the owner (male) are welcoming and willing to assist. The only reason why I'm giving a 2-star rating is that EVERYTIME we place an order over the phone, the lady owner seems to have no phone skills and etiquette! You haven't even finished your requests yet and she'd hang up - without also verifying the name of who is calling or get a phone number in case there is a need to call you back nor bother to clarify the items you ordered and all that jazz. I thought that type of phone call only happens maybe when they are extremely busy but boy was I wrong. Her lack of phone skills and customer service is turning me off (and my co-workers - because they also order/eat at this place since we work within the neighborhood). Dealing with this lady's attitude on the phone and in person is somewhat getting old for us so we're considering not going there anymore. Too bad, everything else with Pho Mai Mai is good. Maybe someday she'll handle the phone calls and personal interactions better. Perhaps then we'll come back."}
{"text":"I ate there a few times before and it was okay until I took my wife there and they served her uncooked chicken skewers and I killed a roach walking toward our table. Our table was dirty and had to ask them to clean it. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place was a go to for my husband and I. We always went in for pho & banh mi. It was amazing!  every time we would walk in we would always talk about how great it was till \"hand\" girl server touched our (banh mi)-- sandwich. Im sure she was just trying to see which was which; yet instead of asking she just picked it up with her bare hands to see for herself. I clearly saw her with no gloves picking up the banh mi. As she walked to our table she acted like she did nothing wrong. When I brought it to her attention she tried to fight it and act as if I was wrong and lying. I asked her to get me a new banh mi and she hesitated and asked me if I was sure. She then told the older woman who makes pho and banh mi about our issue she then took it to the back and act as if she actually made a new one, when normally they make banh mi up front. It was obvious they didn't make me a fresh one. I got up took the other banh mi that hadn't been touched and told the older guy (that makes the pho) we will no longer want the sandwiches and we will only pay for the pho's we had ordered. When it was time to pay, \"hand\" girl server -- she apologized and said she's sorry accidents happen and she couldn't remember if she had pick up the banh mi with her bare hands.. accident happen so I needed to understand she said...   After this experience my husband and I will no longer return."}
{"text":"This place has amazing phö! It's a must stop. We don't have any good phö places around North Las Vegas and this place is beyond \"good.\" Great service and super friendly staff! Highly recommend the chicken phö, shrimp tempura and passion fruit drink! The best. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Food was bad low quality over priced tea was watered way down my sandwich had too much mayo service was mediocre I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for pho. Down side is they totally forget about you as soon as they serve you."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Rare steak pho is my favorite. Staff is very nice and helpful. Place is always clean! Parking is a bit difficult very busy shopping center."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Vietnamese (Pho) restaurant in Vegas -- even over those in Chinatown! The staff is prompt and the Vietnamese chefs certainly know their food. Other than Pho, two must-haves are the Beef Carpaccio Salad (cold plate), and the Cubed Beef Steak plate. AMAZING! The only thing they are missing is the traditional Salted Lemonade and/or the Lemonade Soda. Other than that their menu is BOMB!"}
{"text":"This cuisine is a favorite of my husband and I so we know what good is. Just moved here a few weeks ago and have already been here multiple times. FANTASTIC pho and authentic Vietnamese sandwiches. They even make their bread from scratch... so good. Now I gotta go there for lunch"}
{"text":"I love Pho soup! This restaurant recently opened & this was our first time checking it out. We came at the end of the lunch rush... perfect timing as we seated quickly & served within 10 mins. Pho Soup was tasty. Will return."}
{"text":"I've eaten there two nights in a row and I love it. I had the pork vermicelli bowl. All of the ingredients were fresh and delicious and the fish sauce added so much flavor to the dish without being overpowering. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally a Pho restaurant in NLV!  We ordered shrimp and pork egg rolls, grilled pork sandwich and rare steak beef pho.  The shrimp and pork egg rolls were delicious.  Very crispy and they were not cheap on the fillings.  The grilled pork sandwich was also very good.  The bread was fresh and the pork was grilled perfectly. The only dish I was not fond of was the pho.  The broth was a bit greasy and the flavor was lacking.  I don't normally put hoisen sauce in my pho but I had to this time to give it flavor. We will definitely eat at this restaurant again and will give their pho another chance."}
{"text":"The food was great!!! We loved the broth and was glad that we didn't have to drive all the way to Chinatown for some good pho. I would definitely be comings back for more!"}
{"text":"The food is great, however the customer service is clearly lacking at this establishment. I've come 3 times now and service has been the same each time. Slow. I would give the pho 5 stars since it's the best on the north side of town. Best advice is get it to go."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find a Vietnamese restaurant on Yelp so close to my house. Like another person said. Right away I knew we had to try it. The gentleman that took my order said they just opened 2 weeks ago.   I ordered the special combo bun. It was ok. Other Vietnamese places I've been to include sour pork sausage. I think it was missing something. Lacking taste. My boyfriend got the chicken teriyaki plate. He was able to eat it. Taste like teriyaki we can make at home. Nothing exciting. He said that he wouldn't order it again.   Overall we would give this place another try. Next time we will get some pho."}
{"text":"Came in today to give the Pho a try and I can say it did not disappoint! When I walked in I was the only customer but the staff was super super friendly and couldn't wait to help me. The restaurant was clean and very nicely decorated. The food looked very fresh and made all my order right there. I decided to try the chicken pho since I didn't see raw steak pho on the menu. I got the chicken pho and chicken egg rolls. I had to get it to go since I was rushing to get home but I ate the egg rolls when I got home and they were still hot and crispy. I reheated my pho for dinner and it was really yummy. It had the right amount of seasoning and they provided plenty of garnish to go with it including little packets of hoisin sauce. My only complaint was chili paste wasn't provided as a to go option. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came in to grab lunch to go. Got 2 House special sandwich. Said it'll take 10 mins ended up waiting for 30 mins! For 2 sandwich?! Customers after I ordered got theirs orders first. Wasted my lunch and my time. Thanks."}
{"text":"The food was ok, however the portions were super small.  I will assume that was intentional because my order was a togo order.  Since this place is close to my home I might stop in and grab a bowl just to compare the portions."}
{"text":"Really good Pho! I can see why this place was busy when I arrived. Service was fast and the food came out quickly. The goi cuon was average but the pho made up for it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a neighborhood Vietnamese Restaurant without having to go to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Saw this place had just opened came by with my family . We ordered the Vietnamese sandwich and the pho and didn't think nothing of, but once we tried it omg it was mouth watering!!!! The sandwich bread was perfectly crispy and inside everything tastes amazing! Then the pho itself was so good! The broth was very delicious . Besides they were so friendly . I recommend and I will be coming here more often ."}
{"text":"I've tried so many pho places surprisingly they all taste different. This one i felt like more fastfood than authentic.i did like the fact that they open earlier than other restaurants tho. Staffs were okay but i didnt get my refills unless i asked. Also they dont give you bill.i was waiting for awhile for the bill but other people got up and went pay to the front bar. i didnt know i had to go front to pay."}
{"text":"Was headed to Poke Express for lunch takeout and discovered they are now closed on Wednesdays. So looking at Yelp, saw a new Pho restaurant about a mile away that just recently opened. I wasn't expecting much so I just ordered a basic bahn mi dac biet and brisket pho. As others have mentioned, the pho bowl serving is small and so are the portion size of pho and meat. The broth is not quite as deep and rich as Pho Saigon 8 but is still good 3/5. They do have the standard pho condiments including house chili sauce which is a plus. The bahn mi was very good. The bread is made in house and fresh. It is crispy on the outside and still warm inside. They skimp on the meat but the overall quality of the bread and meat is excellent 5/5. The pho and bahn mi was the perfect amount of food to leave on a full and happy stomach."}
{"text":"Think of the last time you traveled and had a moment where you felt so at home as your food was served to you.  I had this moment today.  Does pho need to be the best pho to deserve a visit? I expected just pho and I got EXACTLY what I wanted! You might ask for extra napkins as you wipe the excess broth you deliciously slurped; ask politely and you shall receive.  I didn't need to travel far for great pho, there's already one here in North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service on the planet, the lady was very rude,she came to our table and did not even say hi,  she was standing on the side of our table and watching us when we were looking at the menu. My wife was trying to order the beef pho and then she immediately corrected her with very bad attitude:\" the pho comes with different meat ok?! It really made me feel uncomfortable,  i mean she could have just take few seconds to introduce all that 3 different types of meat instead of question her, Also there were only few people dining in the store, they were not even busy at all."}
{"text":"I went there twice and both times I tried to order \"house special chow fun\" but ended up getting \"chow mein\" and they excused it like it was chow fun. The 2nd time I literally explained to them the difference between the two noodles and the waiter said he knew what I was talking about but ended up bringing me another style of chow mein. When I told him it wasn't what I ordered the waiter finally admitted to me that they didn't have what I wanted but brought me something different anyways. In the end, these guys are cons and will sell you anything but not what you want. Oh yeah, friends order was salty as well. Anyways, I won't be going back there again..."}
{"text":"Celebrated my mother in-law's Birthday here, my sister in law made the reservation. Food is average taste and pho is good. Place get packed and needs more help. The smoothie boba needs improvement. Staffs are friendly"}
{"text":"Food is great.. my only complain is their customer service. Especially the ladies. Whether you order in person or over the phone, they seem to rush all the time. And when I do order over the phone, they are damn rude! I wish I can talk rudely to them ladies but I dont want them spitting on my pho lol. No complaints on the food... they just gotta really work on their attitude.."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pho is delicious and their sandwiches are soooo yummy!!! I'm so grateful they are so close to the base too. I recommend trying them out. They are also doing 25% off the ticket the whole month of august so go try them out."}
{"text":"The rare steak pho was really good. The won ton soup was surprisingly delicious. We also tried the beef sandwich and the combination sandwich both were super delicious. Service was awesome. Finally a good pho place close to home."}
{"text":"We're craving Vietnamese food, we came across this place.  It was awesome!!!! My kids are picky but this place delivered They have the 3 bean dessert which is the bomb"}
{"text":"Love the food and service here Love the lemongrass chicken plate  and the grilled Pork chop  plate  As well as the chicken and beef pho"}
{"text":"I was excited that a new Vietnamese Pho restaurant opened so close to work and home, we usually go down to Spring Mountain and eat, but it's so far and late at night even after work to drive for dinner.  Tonight we decided to stop and try the place, they were busy and thought \"Ok\" the food must be good.  Boy was that a understatement, I ordered the Seafood ChowMein and my son had the child's Pho with meatballs and Chicken Eggrolls and my wife ordered the Bun Bo Hue noodle soup.  My son's egg rolls came out and I took a bite, it was the worse egg rolls I have ever eaten, barely no chicken, just vegetable.  Then my Chow mein came out and I thought it was a appetizer, it was so boring looking and flavorless, the picture in the menu and what I got was not even close, it tasted (if any) and looked like they took a packet of Top Ramen noodles and put some blan sauce and some meat to the noodles.  Then my wife Bun No Hue came out and I thought she ordered some wierd soup dish that I never seen before,  she was so discusted by the look and the meat they put into it, another words it wasn't Bun Bo Hue that we are use to eating and seeing.  She returned it and was so disappointed she didn't want to order something else and finally, they totally forgot my son's Meatball Pho, didn't even acknowledge the mistake.  We will continue to drive to Chinatown and go to our favorite Vietnamese restaurant \"Viet Noodle Cafe\", we will never return to Pho Mai Mai again, at this rate they will not last long.  You can always tell how good a Vietnamese restaurant is when you don't see any other Vietnamese patrons eating there.  Just like any culture, we are the best judges when it comes to our own Homelands food and culture."}
{"text":"Really excited to see the emergence of Vietnamese cuisine here in the northwest area. Pho was delicious but this rating is based on the attentiveness on the staff. While I understand it is still a new establishment, the refilling of waters, providing napkins and touching base with customers was something that they lacked. We will be back for the food but I hope to see some improvement in the customer service aspect."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place during lunch today. Only about 2 tables were occupied and one person was in front of me. The patron in front of me had a really large order and the cashier helped her carry it to the door. When she came back to the register I patiently waited for her to acknowledge me. She didn't make eye contact with me. Didn't say hello. She simply walked by and started talking to the man next to her. So I asked her if I should grab a menu and take a seat. At that moment she still didn't say hello just said I can go sit at the table in the corner. I told her I was ready to order. I placed my order and the food was brought to my table very quickly. I ordered the beef pho and asked that all of the meat be made well done. For $8.25 the portion was extremely small. My usual spot is Pho Saigon 8 (PS8) but I don't go there often because of the drive. Anyway this portion was about half the size of PS8 and $2 more. There was a lot of meat and some stuff I didn't even recognize. The meat was quite fatty so I only ate about one piece. There weren't very many noodles either. Needless to say I left hungry. Also I ordered the Thai tea Boba which was $4. The tea was bland, there were only a few pieces of Boba but the Boba that was in there was some of the worst I've ever had. On top of the tea being bland the Boba tasted old and had absolutely no flavor. I had to go back up to the counter to inform the staff that I wasn't happy with the tea because no one ever came back to the table to ask if I needed anything or if my food was okay. They remade the drink without the Boba which was better but nothing spectacular.   The place is clean which I appreciated but their service is lacking on all levels. The service at PS8 isn't that much better but I get a better bang for my buck and I always leave full and satisfied. Pho Mai Mai if you want to survive, take heed to the reviews about your service. The staff needs to put a smile on their face, acknowledge and greet every customer that walks through the door, and make your staff take at least ONE trip to the tables to make sure everything is going well for your patrons. With the experience I've had I doubt this business stands the test of time. I will not be returning.   2 stars because it was clean and the broth in the pho/noodles (sans the meat) was good. 0 stars for service."}
{"text":"Never had vietnamese food before, it was awesome! Beef chow mein and seafood chop suey , Great customer service, friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place! I ordered to go. It was hard enough ordering over the phone but I was extremely patience who the person taking my order. I made sure I made my orders clear (said A as in Apple - 7 =A7!) when I got there, I showed her my order I wrote on my phone to make sure she had it right. She forgot an item. After waiting some time, she hands me my order. I usually check my items right then and there but they were pretty busy so I trusted they'd get my order right. When I got home, I got JUST the pho broth and NOTHING else that should have been packed!! So the noodles and meat, etc. we're missing!! Opened up another box and it was completely different than what we ordered. WHAT. THE. HELL. The only thing they managed to get right was the pork crape and freakin sandwich. I haven't been this upset over customer service in awhile. At least the sandwich was decent but I'm NEVER going to order to go again.  Maybe eating here will be different but so far, they've left a bitter impression."}
{"text":"I would wait till they hire some staff that speaks English and have some napkins on the tables everything else was there. Food okay."}
{"text":"We were excited when we had seen a pho place open so close to home.  This place is convenient as it is the only pho place we pass on our way home from work.  We always go to Chinatown for pho so being closer we tried this place out.   The portions are smaller than what we usually get at other places and the pho was just average tasting.  The bun bo hue soup was very different from what we are used to and had very little flavor and no spice at all. And the Vietnamese crepe also was flavorless.   This will probably be a last last minute go to if we are wanting pho and too lazy to drive to Chinatown."}
{"text":"I love their pork and vermicelli, it's so delicious. I've tried their beef and chicken but I love the pork the best. Their food has great flavor and its priced well for what you get."}
{"text":"I ended up here by chance not knowing we have a new Pho restaurant near home.  I decided to try their Beef ball pho and the pork patty rolls.  Both did not disappoint!  Give these guys a try!  They're friendly and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Such great value for really great food! Highly recommend if you're in the area. If you're vegetarian, the tofu bahn mi was bomb."}
{"text":"Today I found two bugs in my soup. I informed the waitress, and she tried telling me that it was \"pepper\" used as seasoning. Pepper never has multiple legs, or wings. I'm really disappointed, because I thought I had found my neighborhood pho restaurant. To top off this bad experience, I was still charged full price for the bug infested soup I was served. Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for new pho restaurants in the area so I checked this one out but why does it seem like every pho place is the same now? The inside is almost identical to Pho Rancho but it is in a better location with chain restaurants in a strip mall. There's a lot of natural light since it's on the corner so it feels more open. There was a very steady flow of customers when I went in for lunch.   I ordered the tofu spring rolls and the tofu and vegetable pho. The spring rolls were smaller than other places but the tofu was thick and chewy. There wasn't a whole lot else going on, just noodles with lettuce inside. Maybe I should stop ordering this everywhere because no one seems to do anything interesting with the dish. The pho was also like I've had it in other restaurants, nothing special but it's what I was expecting anyways. The bowls they serve the pho in do seem smaller than normal but I don't know that the food is any less. The tofu and vegetable pho came with tonnns of broccoli, carrots, bok choy maybe? and onions. The carrots tasted like crayons which was weird. My only real complaint was that they never refilled my water until I was already done eating. I like to put lots of chili paste and sriracha in my pho so it would have been nice to get a refill sooner.   I overheard the staff saying they had only opened a week before so it's awesome that they're doing so well already. Obviously this area was in need of some pho. Overall it was a decent experience. I'd like to come back and try the banh mi or something different so I can see if they can offer anything more unique. If you're just looking to satisfy a pho craving though Pho Mai Mai will be just fine."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and was really craving Pho. I always drive pass this place, so I decided to give it a try and I am so happy that I did! The food is delicious! I LOVE the fried shrimp egg rolls. They are seriously my favorite and I would go here just to get them! The Pho is also delicious! I always get the rare steak and brisket pho and it does not disappoint! The staff is so nice and quick! I will return!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing pho!!! My kids and I go at least 3 times a week.. great prices and great , fast service..will always be back!"}
{"text":"So glad to have a PHO place in NLV! & it was bomb! I would really recommend for you guys to come and try it out!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, the food looks fresh. The service is good and the ambience is comfortable. The only thing I didn't like is the small drinks, that's about it."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is really a gem and I'm so happy to have them be a new addition to NLV! I frequent this strip mall at least 2x a week and was getting a little tired of the usual places!   Being 6 months pregnant and desperate for foodgasms on the regular, they couldn't have come at a better time! Seeing as though this month their offering 25% off the bill I was excited to try it out! I ordered shrimp rolls, beef and meatball pho, and a pork Bahn mi! All to go.. I'm a busy gal ;).  I make it home and first things first.. SIP THAT BROTH!! Bam!! I'm seeing stars and smelling star anise or tasting butterflies! This flavor.. indescribable.. amazing! After adding all the fresh veggies and meats it only got better! I'm addicted to the onion in the mix and the meatball flavors were just above par! Really beating my expectations!   The spring roll was fresh and gets an ok from me! It was really my first time trying one so I can't truly judge. Just not my thing! Although, I must say the peanut sauce was very tasty!   The bahn mi. I was a touch sad at first sight because it looked a little light on filling compared to the photo. I was even more upset when I tasted it because it was amazing and I couldn't help but wish I had more filling!! The pork was really flavorful and tender! The cilantro and cucumber was delicious also! I'll definitely be back tomorrow!  I love Pho Mai Mai!"}
{"text":"Looks quite commercial from the outside like many of the best authentic Phô places, counter intuitive as that may seem, but is some pretty dang good Phô. They also carry some normal dishes like fried rice so you can bring friends that aren't into the specialty dishes as much. Prices are great with most meals being $9-12."}
{"text":"LOVED THIS PLACE BUT HAD PLASTIC IN MY WONTON!!! Seriously so disappointed with this place as it was the best pho and viet sandwiches in North Las Vegas, UNTIL one night, my mom and I came in to have dinner a month and a half ago. I ordered a Wonton Soup, which was $6, and it was served in a tiny bowl. Maybe 1 cup worth of broth, and 2 wontons. I didn't really feel that this is $6 worth of soup to begin with.  After eating through ONE wonton, I chewed through a SHARD OF SHARP GREEN PLASTIC. Literally a 1/2 piece of hard plastic in a cooked wonton!!!!!!!!!! I refused to eat the rest of this soup, and my mom called the waitress over to let her know that there was a shard of plastic. We were REALLY nice letting this lady know that they really fucked this mishap. The lady looked disgusted herself, said sorry took the shard of plastic, and walked away. Didn't even take the bowl of soup. What had me messed up over this place is that when we checked out our bill for dinner, there was no replacing my damn soup, taking it off the bill or simply giving any courtesy discount for the next visit. Keep in mind, I LOVED this place, but after the lack of service and empathy for this safety hazard, I'm disgusted. Don't come here even if the food tastes amazing. That plastic could have cut a gum or even been extremely dangerous to a child!"}
{"text":"The cost of food should match the amount of food they give.  Bowl Pho came in was small but it was good. Wasn't too impressed with the kids meal.  I could get a better deal with a Happy Meal with that price. The Bahn Mi needs more meat/vegetables.  The people there were nice."}
{"text":"Great soup. Fast service. Good prices. All ingredients are fresh and quality.  I come here any and almost any time I want soup. Plus I get orders of more pho to go"}
{"text":"Pho is flavorful a little salty until you add the veggies. So it balances out. Wasn't impressed with the combination fried rice. It was dry including the beef, chicken and shrimp that was in it. I will be back for the pho but not tempted to try anything else. The waitress was a little slow getting back with the check"}
{"text":"Been here three times. The first time dine in was awesome despite the lack of customer service which we thought ok they're new we'll cut them some slack. The second time was to go it took awhile, but they were really busy with the dinner rush which was completely understandable. The third and last time was it I can't cut them some slack they weren't busy the lady who took our order had an attitude you can clearly see she didn't want to work. She asked if we were ready to order and in the middle of ordering she walks off to get a pen and paper but doesn't even say anything or apologized for walking away. The food lacked in taste, customer service never improved and doesn't really look like it will."}
{"text":"I tried this place last week.  I had chicken fried rice.  The rice was delicious but the I can't even count how many pieces of chicken still had bones in.  The first piece of chicken had a big bone but I kept eating.  Needless to say, I ended up picking all the chicken out just to eat the rice.  Definitely not worth the money I spent."}
{"text":"Finally a Pho Restaurant in North Town!   Thats a few stars in itself lol   My roommate decided to stop by for take out one night and she was gracious enough to bring me some food too. We shared the orange chicken, the beef carpaccio, and the seasoned beef. Each entree came with a side of rice and the portions were decent.   The orange chicken was flavorful and they had bits of jalapeno which gave it a nice kicky flavor.  The beef carpaccio is layed over a mound of salad, so if you wanted this as a meal alone it is definitely doable.  The seasoned beef was by far my favorite. The flavor was just perfect. Finger licking good.   My girlfriend ordered a bowl of Pho as well, which I didn't get too experience. She did wish there were more veggies added to the order and she also bought some shrimp rolls for her son. Which he seemed to really enjoy ( he practically ate them all ).   So food very yum!   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"pretty good!!! i ordered pork and egg roll vermicelli, pork banh mi, combination chow mein, and a brisket pho! it was all pretty good except the chow mein wasn't as good, maybe that's just personal preference. the water also tasted good which is something i always look for in a restaurant!! they were a bit slow but thankfully we got there before a rush so our food didn't take as long. i appreciate how close it is to my house!! i will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Shrimp fried rice was pretty good, shrimp spring rolls weren't to bad, orange chicken was kind of watered down , and the taro smoothie was not the best. Cashier was somewhat rude, then after I paid, she sort of changed her demeanor"}
{"text":"Very nice modern restaurant.  Service is excellent. Had the vermicelli bowl and spring rolls for appetizer. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Update: We went back today and were happily surprised to find out the owner had taken my suggestion and adjusted the serving sizes so that you can now order a \"large\" if you wish.  We both got larges and ate our fill of excellent Vietnamese food.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Viet Noodle Bar, but if I do not want to drive far this would be my go to place here in North LV. Their soup is really flavorful. I always order the combination Pho, their beef meatball is so good, it has a nice flavor to it, the brisket is not fatty at all and has a good amount of fat to meat ratio, the rare meat was nicely cooked in the hot broth,their tripe and tendon were so soft and tender. Can't really say anything bad about this place. I'm glad there's a pho place in the North side of town."}
{"text":"From a Vietnamese guy's point of view:  If you want the best Pho ever; go to Vietnam.  If you want next best Pho; go to Bolsa Ave in Westminster Cali.  Pho Mai Mai has pretty good Pho, the broth is tasty, and bowl size would be considered small which I usually would order if had option.  The restaurant is rather on the cozy side with less than 15 tables.  It's a Vietnamese family run business with decent service.  The wait after you order is average compared to Chinatown.  So far it's the best Pho place in North Las Vegas, and if you live in the area; way better than driving to Chinatown.  I would recommend this to my family and you."}
{"text":"We finally have a pho place in our area....yeeeaaay!   I have been wanting to have a steaming bowl of soup since they opened but never got to until 2 days ago. First thing I noticed was how clean the place is and how friendly the owner was. Their decor is not over the top either.   The combination pho I ordered looked and smelled so good, I couldn't wait to dig in. Of course it came in a big bowl, not a giant bowl with a side of veggies. They were very generous with the meats. The broth was delicious, not greasy. After adding the veggies, some hoisin sauce, chili sauce and lime juice, it was even better. I couldn't stop eating. I loved everything that was in that bowl of goodness. If I have one small negative thing to say, it's that the tripe was still a little tough and chewy. Other than that, I have NADA complaints.  I see myself frequenting Pho Mai Mai  more especially in the winter months."}
{"text":"I come here more often than I should but the pho is delicious and I can't help myself. The best thing about this place is the consistency with their food and their service. Never had a single issue since they opened back in August. The north side needed a good pho place."}
{"text":"You already know... north town is lacking a variety of foods, so imagine our excitement when we saw this pho place open up! We came on a Sunday night and it was PACKED! I felt bad due to the small amount of staff compared to the number of customers, we had to wait a while to get our food but considering the circumstances, well understood. The prices are reasonable, and the flavor was great! Upside, they have a to-go station up front, but I would def recommend ordering ahead. Ambience is nothing fancy, but definitely worth a stop if you are wanting pho!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't see the bad rating in this place. I'm a very picky person when it comes to my pho taste and the service. This place is great! The gentleman working here served me and my family (of 3) and got our order down PERFECTLY without writing it. With the extras I asked for as well. That's awesome! Everything came out to us in a timely matter, not a long wait at all. I give this place 5 stars for wonderful customer service and tastely fulfilling food! Thank you Pho MaiMai!! Our new Go To pho spot!!"}
{"text":"Good pho, but have had much better. Server wasn't very friendly. Ordered Pepsi got Sprite, it happens. Also ordered steak, tendon and meatball pho. No meatballs were in bowl. Came with tripe instead. Kind of a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This place has really delicious food. Their Phos broth is very flavorful no need to add condiments. Plus the employees are very nice and fast."}
{"text":"Well, there was a curly black hair in my soup (I am blonde) which is disgusting. Then, I ordered \"fresh squeezed orange juice\" and it was basically sugar water with an orange slice in it. It wasn't good and it was super expensive! Then, at the end they double charged us for drinks and wouldn't remove the mistake from the receipt. Terrible customer service and restaurant, I most definitely won't be back! I rarely write reviews but felt it was necessary with this place."}
{"text":"So happy this restaurant opened near my house. For the longest time I would have to drive down to spring mountain to get good pho. I can say I no longer need to drive down there for pho. I ordered the pho Thai and it was amazing. So sad they opened when we are moving away at the end of the year."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, took advantage of the 25% off since today is the last day. The person that took my order was very friendly and helpful. My order was to go, took about 10 min. Food was good and flavorful and very reasonable prices compared to other pho restaurants in chinatown. My only dissapointment was the combo pho I ordered. I literally got half of a meatball and 2 small slices of steak. I'm hoping they forgot the rest of the meat and it was a mistake, giving them the benefit of the doubt!! I will try this place again and see how much meat I get this time on my pho!! That will be my decision to continue to come or not..."}
{"text":"No refills on water. Ever.  Wrong order was given  Borderline rude staff.  strawberry/banana smoothie is pretty good.  But That's still gonna be a no for me dogg  Ps. Go to sunflower Vietnamese restaurant, way better pho."}
{"text":"Disappointing !! Service is good but for me the comb fried rice was not something to remember. The peas were cold, the meat dry, carrots processed, and the rice seems left over from yesterday or early this morning. Oh, yeah and the  shrimp still needed to be deveined .... not worth complaining.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was playing arround with my yelp yesterday & suddenly I saw \"Pho Mai Mai\" , I'm so happy a vietnamese restaurant just open about 2 blocks from my house. Yay!!!  Right away I asked my husband to have lunch there. It's location by craig rd & losee rd, next to cipotle & five guys,the same shopping center with lowes & sam's club. I like the decoration of the little traditional vietnamese hat on their ceiling,super cute.   Ok, now we talk about the food They have a lot of food to order from ; appertizers $3-$9, pho $8.25-$11.95, rice plate $7.95-$11.50, fried rice $7.95-$9.95, noodle dishes $8.25-$9.25, vietnamese sandwich $5.25, their specialties $8.25-$11.95, kids menu $5.50, drinks & dessert $1.50-$4.  I ordered \"rare beef & beef meatball pho\" ( P05 ) $8.25 and my husband ordered \"rare steak pho\" ( P07 ) $8.25. The pho came with a side fresh beansprout,asian basil & jalapeno. After the pho arrived, We try the broth first without put anything, it  has a really good flavor & smell good even it was a little bit salty for me but after I add my lime, hoisin sauce & hot sauce (I always put a lot whenever I have soup) It didn't taste to salty & I'm ready to eat.  As far for my husband.. he said it was good and if a little bit less salt, this pho will really really really good. He add lime, hoisin sauce & hot sauce too, but keep in mind he did not put as much as I am but overall we love it!!!!!   Whoever served us yesterday, you gave us a good customer service!!! He came to check us if everything was alright, do we need anything & refill our drink. Please keep a good work & stay open!!   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!  Ps: they have a promotion, you get discount 25% off from your order for the whole month of august."}
{"text":"I am from Seattle & was spoiled my entire life with incredible Vietnamese food. I have lived in Vegas 2 years and I have finally found my Pho spot! Inexpensive & YUMMY. The broth is incredible - I didn't even put hoisin or sriracha because it was so incredible on its own. The location is perfect & only a few minutes drive from the house.   My (very picky) boyfriend loved his first Bahn Mi sandwich, my steak meatball pho was devoured & our spring rolls were perfect!   Only recommendation is to get those yummy cream puffs in (once again, I was spoiled in Seattle by those cream puffs). We got to meet the owner when we stopped by & he was incredibly kind. I cannot wait to come back!  Pho Mai Mai has two new regulars!"}
{"text":"It's my second visit and that means something right :). I would consider this place more of a take out with some tables to eat in if you'd prefer.  The first time I had Pho Gha to go and it was very tasty. It comes with all the accessory ingredients nicely packed on the side. Definitely going for  This time I had spring rolls and chicken fried rice. Both were good for the price. The chicken bits might have been. A bit dry, maybe not so fresh. The rolls had a bit too much lettuce to my likings. Certainly a great place for lunch and dinner on a budget."}
{"text":"We had the shrimp spring roll filled with ice burg lettuce...no flavor. We also tried the seafood chow mein.  It had lots of  Chinese cabbage, 3 pieces of shrimp, round gummy pieces of something,  and  Didn't have good flavor either. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Place very clean, pho soup is amazing ! Service is good and nice . They great as u walk In . Kids friendly . Menu easy to read and understand"}
{"text":"Came here to try their pho. I got inside and sat myself and they came with a menu. I ordered the P2 pho. I wish they had more tripe in the pho but it was mostly meat. There was barely any tendon in it and it was very hard and not chewable as well. The pho broth was just average. Size of pho is good but bit pricey for that amount of pho. Overall my meal was just average. Wish they had sauce bowls ready if you wanted to make dipping sauce for your pho. You also have to ask for fish sauce. Service was okay as well. Nobody came to check up on me or refill my water. Place was just okay for me."}
{"text":"i was looking at some of the other reviews and tips and it seems like people have no patience, the same people that complain about food taking a long time are the same people that have never worked in a busy restaurant or probably never even made food for themselves honestly,  at this restaurant we have people trying to make a living out of something they opened all by themselves it's not some huge chain and it's also a restaurant that has only been open for a couple of months to begin with, people have no clue what it takes to run a restaurant, let them figure everything out and work out all the bugs before you leave a bad review, my wait time wasn't bad at all it was actually very pleasant. ((if you want someone to rub your back while you eat go to applebee's or chilis))  overall this place is awesome they have vege pho with vege broth as well, super nice people, finally there is a good Vietnamese place in north las vegas keep going guys your doing great!"}
{"text":"Went there last night first time customer....bought two banh mi sandwiches. Glad to say the sandwiches are awesome, delicious and freshly made. Will go there again and try the other food in the menu!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last Sunday with my family. It was pretty busy considering it was a Sunday, but I suppose it was around dinner time as well. I wasn't really expecting much because we all know the go to pho places are at Spring Mountain. I ordered the number 1 since it seemed like the safe bet when at a new pho place. The serving size isn't as big as most Spring Mountain locations, but I am surprised at how good the broth was! I am a stickler when it comes to broths for pho, because to me, that's the best part, DUH! I was happy with the flavor and the taste of the pho overall. My hubby ordered the chicken bahn mi, and that was super yummy as well! The bread was soft, the chicken was marinated well and it was a good size. We will definitely be coming back, especially because living on this side of town you don't get many places that can serve pho as close to Spring Mountain pho without the drive!"}
{"text":"The food here is great!!! I only like coming when the younger lady is working during the afternoon going towards dinner time. She's very friendly! Other than that, I don't like coming because I feel like the people during the morning/lunch are very lazy to come and fill my drink up and they don't come around to check up on me."}
{"text":"Maybe we picked a the wrong day of the week to try this place.  The wait was redonkulous!!! So we thought we'll... maybe the food will be worth the wait... NOT!!!!  They were sooo in the weeds that people were just walking out.  It looked like grandma and grandpa was cooking all the food, mom and dad looked totally defeated trying to take orders/serve tables.  I almost wanted to jump behind the line and bail them out.  Once the food came, my husbands order was incorrect.  It took them 3 times to get it right.  Since they were so busy, the food was just thrown together.  It didn't taste that great, but I was soooo hungry since we waited soooo long, I devoured my food.   We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Honestly the food was great and all but the customer service is not all that great!   I feel like just because we looked younger then most of the people there we got treated differently. The lady that helped us , helped the couple behind us as well and was having conversations with them.  For us there was no eye contact at all they just left our food , my brother asked for extra lemons and she didn't get them . I don't know if it was cause she didn't hear him but again that's when the waitress needs to look at us in the eye so she knows we're talking to her. Therefore you get a 3 outta 5 . Treat everyone the same"}
{"text":"Finally they open a pho spot in NLV... First time here and i am unbelievably satisfied  I got pho and fresh spring rolls and every bite was so good!!! I'll be coming back since it's just down the street!!! Their staff are super friendly which is a plus :)     Ps: They should offer bigger pho bowls cus it's that good!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good for north las Vegas  the pork sandwich is good the pho was tasty you don't get as big a bowl as other place but it hits the spot."}
{"text":"Came here finally and not only did our server not know what was in some of the speciality soups. We ordered a thing of the Vietnamese wings and it didn't look anything like the photo . I got rare flank that really ended up being a flavorless over cooked flank and the shrimp spring rolls had absolutely no flavor .  The one star mostly stems from the service tho because the young girl didn't introduce herself , come check on us or give the check .  At the register I got a bag and container for my soup but never was presented a check and I had other stuff I would of brought home .  I'm sad since this is so close to me that I most likely won't be back unless I'm desperate.  My avocado smoothie tasted ok tho"}
{"text":"What The Pho?   After allowing myself to starve in the parking while debating dining options I realized Pho Mai Mai signage was a little different. The location is under new management and overall a completely different restaurant!   I ordered Shrimp Fried Rice $9 (Don't Judge Me) because lets me honest I don't eat Vietnamese much (I'm trying to fix that though). The portion was a nice family size serving, however the rice was super bland. No spectacular flavor that stood out or warrants more than a generous three stars.    The service was quick (despite reviews) which is always a bonus.   Side note: I'm not a fan of children running around behind the counter, kitchen and dining areas. Children running around areas where food is prepared during business hours in my opinion is inappropriate."}
{"text":"Newly opened vietnamese pho restaurant, per owner opened august 2017, very plenty of time for improvements, im visiting from the bay area where there's wonderful pho restaurants everywhere, needs improvements on the following: manpower because theres still no busboy, tables are empty but used dishes are still on top and the floor beneath it are littered with napkins and straw wraps etc, the people cooking and handling food are not wearing gloves in fact the rice noodles are handled with barehands to the strainer then dipped into boiling water/broth, the meats (beef and chicken) are not soft in fact theyre very chewy on the crispy noodle dish, the tendons and meats in the pho are hard and chewy. I hope the owners are reading these comments because this restaurants spot is in a good location. I look forward to a better dining experience next time."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant out and I'm not too sure how I feel about it. This place has oxtail pho and I was craving it and not a lot of pho restaurants have oxtail. I figured I could call in and place an order for pick up but no one answered. Which was fine because I figured maybe they were busy to which they were when I arrived. Maybe they should get online ordering since it's a pretty busy place? Anyway the broth of the pho was great. Very flavorful. 3stars total because the amount of broth was pretty low in the container. As for the meat I was pretty disappointed as well there was small tiny pieces. I even ordered additional brisket and that was a small serving too. Maybe the pho restaurants in China town spoil you more?? I'd probably go back for just the beef pho and dine in to see if it's the same type of experience."}
{"text":"I've only got takeout, but the dining area is quite spacious and plenty of seating. We typically make the trek to Chinatown for pho, but had a huge craving and didn't feel like driving down to Spring Mountain. We've had pho, banh mi and the spring rolls so far. I really enjoyed the food and there's plenty of options on the menu. The pho broth is not as rich as most pho shops that we go to, but the banh mi bread is very fresh and delicious crusty bread. We have already gone twice this week and will definitely try again."}
{"text":"So hard to find good Pho. Great price and sizes. Flavorful. Nice staff. Always a good choice and glad there's one close by now  shrimp fried rice"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese place on the north side of town! They have a good selection but the portion size is a little small. You get a lot of veggies but little meat. The meat does have good flavor though. Would recommend to anyone looking for Vietnamese food on the north side that doesn't want to drive to China town."}
{"text":"this place open by my house & thank goodness! we really don't have a good pho place in north LV so i'm grateful!   the boss is great! customer service is great!  the broth is delicious & my kiddos LOVE their banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches). i get the banh xeo ( Veitnamese crepe) with shrimp and pork. not too many places have it and i'm glad they do! If you haven't had one, try it!!   i hope more people visit the restaurant, even though it's small, it's worth it! i would hate to see yet another yummy restaurant leave north lv...."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time. Food was amazing. Although it would get busy at times, the customer service was prompt and responsiveness to our needs. People should be more understanding of the service with the amount of crowd they get. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Freshness  I am so pleased a legit pho place has opened on the Northside. We stopped in for dinner as a family and were extremely impressed.   Overall, the food is FRESH. Surprisingly fresh for an asian place, an asian place in NLV and in general for a pho restaurant. The spring rolls were tasty and big. The brother was the highlight for me. The anise really comes through. It's not oily or heavy, it makes your warm all over. It's AMAZING. Seriously. I would drink the broth by the cupful. It's MUCH better than any pho place I've been to. Also, RARE STEAK ON THE SIDE. It's perfect.  On a separate occasion, we ordered takeout. Everything came on the side and separated for convenience and so that we would be able to build it ourselves.   There are hooks on the spoons if you dine it. They prevent your spoon from sliding in your bowl. You can also order fresh drinks- passion fruit is a favorite in our house. Real passion fruit is used and you can see the seeds and pulp in your drink.  This place is a big thumbs up. Hope they stick around!"}
{"text":"Located on NE corner of Craig Rd and Losee in a large strip mall next to Chipotle.  I went there for the first time yesterday with my family.  The restaurant is clean and the tables are fairly spaced  apart so you don't feel like you are crowded in.  We were seated immediately after walking in.  Our waiter was very polite and didn't rush us as we looked through the menu.  We ordered the shrimp roll, well-done rare steak pho, and the seafood pho.  The portions are smaller than their counterparts on Spring Mountain Rd west of the Strip, but well worth it since we didn't have to drive 40 minute and deal with the traffic.  I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"Finally pretty decent Vietnamese food in north Las Vegas. We ordered the pho which was decent nothing special but the price matched what you get and the size. Good flavor and exactly what you expect. Certainly a good place to take someone who has never had pho before. This place really is a 3.5 star. I also like the interior; very bright and large. The reviews here say that the service is slow but when we were there it was pretty fast and it was busy so maybe they got their act together and listened to the reviewers on yelp. Definitely a must go especially if you live in north Las Vegas since your only other option is sunflower Vietnamese restaurant (which isn't all that great especially cuz of the ownership there). Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food is their saving grace here, because they know nothing about customer service. Granted we walked in when they were busy, but it took them a while to acknowledge us and clean off a table to let us sit down. 3 other parties that came in after us all got their food before we did. In my opinion they need more people working there. They only had one lady taking all the orders, delivering the food and refilling the waters. Also the phone rang off the hook and most times it was never answered, due to only having one guy behind the counter to get all the to-go orders ready and answer the phone. I did notice that to-go orders were ready pretty quick but I would rather enjoy sitting down to enjoy my food there. Overall the place is decent, food is great but with some tweaks it could be my go to pho place up in the north."}
{"text":"I'm a firm believer that you get what you give. Give positive vibes and you'll get positive vibes especially in food establishments (with the exception of Chinese restaurants). And this is not a Chinese restaurant. I've been here several times to dine in or get food to-go. My experiences have been 100% positive so, I'm not sure what people are whining about in terms of service.  It's a family-owned business and I applaud them for competing with chain restaurants in this strip mall. Who cares if their kids help out during summer break?!? That's how Asian families teach their kids responsibility (I worked in our family's construction business when I was 4 and I loved it) so, no this isn't a daycare or child labor (check your judgmental self especially if your life isn't perfect). How can a person with multiple check-ins at McDonald's complain about service??? LOL  So anyway, about the food...I've tried their spring rolls, different types of pho and vermicelli bowls. I like them all and I haven't tried anything I didn't like. If you live in this area, it's a good source of Vietnamese goodness but if you have to drive more than 30 minutes to get here, stay in Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"Pretty solid pho for the price. Its not the best I've ever had, but the service is decent and prices arent bad. Broth is better than average"}
{"text":"This place has some really good soup!! The food was great! It needs a good scrubbing and cleaning! Menus were dirty and tables were dirty but over all it was good. We will go back :)"}
{"text":"After a few visits both dining in and carryout...I am really glad we are having more restaurants pop up in our neck of the woods. Which why prices being slightly higher is to be expected. For me, price and quality ratio isn't balanced. Although, I will say it is a pretty decent spot to get your Viet fare fix. I have had their banh mi and the grilled pork and spring roll vermicelli. I felt their banh mi was lacking considering it's price. I didn't quite enjoy the grilled pork and spring roll vermicelli. The spring roll had a weird tap water flavor to it. That's the best way I can describe it. Flavor was super light as well. The grilled pork was meh. I've had this dish time and time.over again from.other places and safe to say, wasn't a fan of their rendition. My experiences here is like survival mode. I wouldn't prefer to come here, BUT...I'd survive through it if we did. Lol.  The service during our visits has also been super slow. So slow we weren't sure whether we were supposed to go up to order at he register or continue to wait. When my husband finally got up assuming that's what we had to do...the guy at the register had my husband sit back down as someone would get to us. And so we waited some more. Looking around at everyone else, they all seem to be doing some waiting themselves. Our plates came in staggered, but thankfully not to where one of us finished our meal first. I would of had a fit, and I'm very patient when it comes to this.  As for the husband, he typically orders their pho and thought it wasn't so bad. It'd make do.  Overall, just another fare in your neighborhood that'll save you a trip from going further. Nothing extra exciting but the excitement of having that fix within your vicinity.  Also, they do have a kids menu which I usually get happy about in such places. Certainly a place to give a try. Then you decide...  Stroller and kid friendly!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A little note before I start my review. To everyone complaining about service, this is a small business, a NEW small business at that. They are always busy which goes to show how awesome their food is. When they do get around to you, they're pleasant. So please don't bring the review down based on that.  Now for my review. The food is ALWAYS on point. My pho is ALWAYS amazing and piping hot with more than enough noodles to satisfy a hungry belly. Everything is fresh and gets to your table in a timely manner. If you can get past the 5 minute wait (because let's be honest, they don't let you wait THAT long. Dalai, it's a restaurant.) then you'll love this place just as much as I do.  #SupportLocal"}
{"text":"So excited to have a pho place close to home! Quick and friendly service. I tried their combo pho and it was pretty good. The broth makes or breaks pho and I can say theirs is solid. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm glad another pho place opened up in this area. I was quite disappointed when Pho Rancho closed permanently. The pho and the other Vietnamese rice dishes in this restaurant is good. I would have given them 5 stars if only their service is faster. I would say they need more servers, but I also give them some credit since they just opened and is most likely still trying the new business. All in all, I am satisfied with our dining experience and would surely come back for some more pho."}
{"text":"I ordered a veggie pho and on the veggies it come with I found a roach in the soup I forgot to take a picture but I don't recommend for you to go there no it's  dirtying disgusting I will never come here again"}
{"text":"When you live on the north side of town you're so far from everything... especially your fave pho place on spring mountain. Luckily, I came across this place only 5min away from home.   Let me start off by saying, this restaurant is very spacious and clean! I love how it doesn't feel so tight and stuffy. We were greeted and seated right away! They have a big menu with lots of different options. From pho, to bahn mi & fried rice. I literally wanted to eat everything.... Anyways, I ordered the shrimp & pork spring rolls, shrimp & pork salad, vegetable pho w/ a side of brisket & a strawberry smoothie.  The food came out quick! It wasn't a long wait at all. +1 star because I love fast service esp when you're starving!!! The spring rolls were good just like any other spring rolls (4/5). The pho was small compared to other pho places I've been to, their bowl was small. I usually share my pho with my partner but it wasn't big enough to share.... the pho was good especially on a cold night. Not the best pho I had but also not the worst (4/5). The shrimp & pork salad was gooood! I love anything with shrimp and veggies. It came with shredded lettuce and cabbage underneath & a fish sauce dressing.   I would love to try the other items on their menu! I just love the location for this place and for decent pho."}
{"text":"I think I'm on a roll for not so great food or service. First we walked in, waited forever to Order and received our beverages after our food arrived. It also wasn't a clean establishment."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Very friendly staff, fast food and great quality. This will be my family's new pho restaurant."}
{"text":"Slow service. They took forever to even get to taking my order (i walked up to the counter and waited for someone to take my order.) worst yet i only ordered taro smoothie, 15min wait. My gf asked about the order and the middle aged balding man taking orders appeared annoyed we were asking bout our smoothie. Think ill pass next time i come visit family here."}
{"text":"The food is really good and priced very reasonable.  However, if you have never been there are two things to keep in mind to make your visit a little easier.  One, if you are dining in just take a seat anywhere.  Only go to the counter if you are getting take away.  Two, when you are ready to pay go to the register at the counter.  I sat for 10 minutes waiting for the check to no avail. I finally went to the counter and my waitress met me there as if it was the natural thing to do."}
{"text":"FINALLY a pho place on the north side thats worth eating at... portion looks small but filling and service is good."}
