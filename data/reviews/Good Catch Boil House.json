{"text":"Friendly, helpful, and professional Hostess and Waitress .
I had the Clams with a Garlic Butter Sauce and my Wife had the cold Lobster Roll
Both were delicious and the beer \" Side Launch \" on Tap was good too. 
Our first visit and looking forward to the next time."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Food is great, environment is very relaxed and comfortable. The sliders and shrimp in lemon/pepper sauce are the best"}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite seafood places. love the shrimps, mussels, and crabs... the deep fried oyster was good too.  the fish and chips wasnt bad either.. i enjoy my meals here and its always fresh.. i just find the good catch boil sauce a bit salty but everything else is great.. Keep it up !!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and very tasty. All their seafood are served in plastic bags with the seasonings of your choosing. Would recommend and plan on returning."}
{"text":"Great service. No question. But the food just doesnt compare to Captains boil.  The sauces are either too salty or heavy on the garlic. The lobster nacho - don't get it. You will be disappointed with the lack of lobster and lack of any flavour. We (group of four) also got shrimp, mussels, corn and brussel sprouts. On a positive, the shrimp were large. That's all. Corn was small. And the brussel sprout was undercooked. Never going back and even told people beside us who were very tempted by the gorgeous pics of the nacho NOT TO GET IT.  Wish we could have told the huge line up of ppl to leaveeeeeee!"}
{"text":"Most restaurants are usually a disappointment. This one certainly is not. 

I was not sure what to expect; the downtown core of Markham is currently under construction. Immediately after stepping into Good Catch Boil, that feeling of a place that is not quite finished disappeared. The restaurant is spacious but feels cozy. There is a pleasant scent of real lemon in the place (for those of you that are sensitive to scents as I am). 

We were seated right away and offered drinks, and then food, at the right times. 

The lobster roll was absolutely delicious; the bread was perfect and the lobster (with garlic hot butter) tasted unencumbered by other seasonings that would detract from the lobster. The soft-shell crab sandwich, which I 'borrowed' from my wife, was incredible. I usually don't pay attention to the sides (fries etc) but I must say that they all tasted fresh. The staff was friendly and helpful (I suggest asking them for recommendations). 

Shortly after we left, we wanted to return again. 

Not only will I return, I will return tonight. I loved the place, the staff, the atmosphere, and the fresh-tasting food. 

I would suggest getting there early. As we were leaving, there was quite a line-up. 

My only gripe with the place is that they are not open for lunch."}
{"text":"Got there around 7 p.m. on a cold Thursday night. Restaurant was all but empty, which was strange for a business during rush hour in Downtown Markham. Our server was helpful and provided great customer service. We got 1lb bags of mussles and shrimp, as well as deep fried oysters and lobster nachos. Food was overall flavourful and arrived in a timely manner. While the food was delicious, I couldn't help but feel that the portions were a tad small since I was not full at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and food is good. Happy hour special is worth it for the price. I'm giving three stars because of the service though. Almost every time I come here the servers are all at the bar talking. Today was so bad that I had to say something. It was 12am on a Saturday, only around three tables. The servers were taking shots at the bar together and anything I asked our server for, she forgot and I had to ask a second time. At one point I even saw her hugging and making out with what I assumed to be was her boyfriend. If it was busy I could understand forgetting when I ask for the bill or condiments, but there were only three tables there tonight. As a server myself, I get that you want to have fun on the job but this was really unprofessional."}
{"text":"Restaurant is spacious with different seating options (booths, regular tables, bar height tables, etc)... Staff are very nice... 
Lobster nachos weren't available tonight because their broiler wasn't working... 

Lobster bisque... Comes in a paper bowl.... Cream added on top before serving.... Good lobster flavour... Lots of lobster pieces.... We liked it a lot... 

We ordered 2 lobster rolls (1 hot with butter and 1 cold with mayo).... Both were tasty but the hot one seemed to be almost too buttery.... We enjoyed the cold one more.... Both lobster rolls were jam packed with lobster.... It does come with fries, salad, and coleslaw... It's not apparent on the menu that the lobster rolls come with anything... The picture on the menu shows only the lobster roll... There also isn't an asterisk next to it whereas several other ones that come with fries (also shown in the pictures on the menu) have an asterisk to show you can substitute for sweet potato fries for $1 more..

Fried oyster basket was good... Good value with over 10 oysters in the basket... Cooked to perfection... Also came with fries... 

Fish and chips were crispy and nicely battered... Came piping hot... I asked for no Cajun spice as my son was eating the fries from this dish.... The fries seemed a little light in colour but tasted fine... 

Dungeness crab.... We ordered with curry sauce and mild spice..... This felt like it was definitely spicy and not mild or even medium... I got some sauce on the outside of my lips because who can really eat this in a nice ladylike manner?....my lips were burning.... I can take spicy and I liked it... But my husband can't take spicy much so it was too spicy for him.... Curry was super flavourful.... One of the multiple options that you can add to any of your boils is vermicelli... I was tempted to, but glad I didn't because it would have been too spicy for the vermicelli.... 

Pop comes in a bottle... Which the waitress told us... 

The little things that I noticed were the bibs and gloves... They were thicker and better quality than other restaurants that do boils as well... I didn't need to change my gloves but at the other boil restaurants, I often puncture or rip my gloves and go thru more than 1 pair for sure... 

We'll definitely be back..."}
{"text":"I was told no reservation was allowed for party under 6 for a sunday dinner, turns out that restriction only applies for fri and sat, but not for sunday. Some employees need more training on company policy I guess? Unfortunately got turned down for a table of 4 even our family arrived at 5:10 pm since they are really full. By the way, I was offered to have the table till 5:55 at that point, THANKS but no thanks, don't think my family is speedy eater could order, eat and finish all the food within 45 mins."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on date night. We came early so it was pretty empty. Service was friendly and the food came out fast. Food was very tasty. I really liked the oyster sliders."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend tonight and we ordered a soft shell crab sandwich and a oyster slider. The presentation of the food was good, however we found a piece of PUBIC hair in one of the oyster slider. When we told the waitress about it she immediately took the food away and sent back another one later without saying a word.  There was no apology and they brushed it off as if nothing happened. When we confronted them about the hair she acted as if we were causing trouble and did not take us seriously. I won't be returning and would not recommend this place to anyone. Overall my experience at this restaurant was very unpleasant."}
{"text":"Nice decor and friendly staff. Much more spacious than CB. Can't wait for their liquor license."}
{"text":"Amazing food, at a fair price and a cool new, hip sportsy atmosphere! Great for sports fans or even just a family outing. Either way u wont feel out of place here! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Overall:
4.5 stars

Parking:
Accessible parking, but I came on a busy Tuesday movie night so I had to loop around multiple times to find parking even when I drove to the far corners of the lot. 

Service:
Very nice and pleasant server. She explained the menu and was attentive to our needs. The owner/manager(?) also came around to ensure we were looked after. 

The restaurant is new, so it's quite nice inside. It is spacious and comfortable. I like how there's big screen televisions playing a few different sports at once. It's spacious and I don't feel like I'm crowded with other people. 

Food:
I enjoyed the food here. My friend and I ordered the oyster sliders, lobster roll (with Caesar and Cajun fries), and a pound of garlic butter shrimp. 

The boil was as expected. Shrimp was reasonably fresh, not sandy/crumbly, but not extremely crisp either. The garlic butter was nice because they put tons of garlic in there. Delicious!

The oyster sliders were the highlight of our meal. I highly recommend them. The mayo and fried onion complement the fried oyster quite well. 

The lobster roll surprised me in price as the dish seemed small for 22ish dollars. However the roll probably had as much meat as a lobster tail, so I wasn't disappointed. The fries and salad were a bit small and did leave me wanting more. 

Comparisons:
The one that comes to mind of course is The Captain's Boil. This restaurant has similar offerings, but adds to it with more a la carte, deep fried and non boil items. I think this restaurant wins in diversity as well as a more hip and inviting atmosphere. 

Impression:
I was impressed and I will be visiting again! I just can't eat here as often as I would want, cause the food can be a bit heavy (y'know.. if you wanna be health conscious )"}
{"text":"I've had dinner here a couple times and had wanted to try their lunch menu. Was very excited to hear they have poke bowls!! 
You choose your base (sushi rice, brown rice or zoodles), your sauce and choose between 4 different bowl combos ($12.99 for either the salmon, tuna or beef and veggie is $10.99). Got the salmon with sushi rice and spicy mayo. It was sooooo good!! Wow, I forgot how much I like spicy mayo! Great portion size, felt it was a good rice to toppings ratio and lots of spicy mayo. Didn't really like the tangerine bits but I never do in salads/bowls. Loved the seaweed salad and jalapenos. Had briefly entertained the thought of ordering lobster nachos to share as I've never had them but glad I didn't bc I was completely satisfied with the poke bowl. 
The interior of this place really goes well with the food (hanging oars on the walls and cool signage everywhere) and the servers are always very friendly. Take a look at their menu for all the ingredients in each bowl. There's a lot packed into those poke bowls. Can't wait to try the tuna one next!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends last night and had a fantastic time!  Big, loud, hopping busy space on a Saturday night.

This was our first experience at a seafood boil type restaurant. Plastic bibs, plastic gloves, and lots of napkins required. Great beer selection, perfect choices for a accompanying seafood.  Lots of sports on big screens, which is right up my alley but maybe not the most conducive for chatting with friends. 

Upbeat, fun servers make you feel welcome and the food comes really fast.  Tons of options, and a great 'build your own boil' selection. My only critique of this part would be the lack of a traditional southern boil, which would feature several seafood choices with corn and potatoes included. The sides are extra, and each seafood choice is separate. A handful of raw Brussels sprouts for $5 is a bit off. 

However, the food was great! The lobster roll was a tender, juicy, butter-rich delight. Cajun fries are a bit addictive. But the side salad is lame, just some romaine with flavourless cheese and little to no dressing.

I had the Dungeness crab, which was absolutely delicious.  Another big oversight is the fact they don't have metal lobster/seafood picks to dig out all the tender morsels of meat. We asked and were given a long narrow plastic spoon that didn't really fit into the openings. Took a lot of work, but with great reward. 

The soft shell crab sandwich and sliders were a big hit at our table, as were the chock-full-of-garlic mussels.  A big star was the shared lobster nachos. At first I thought, cheese, sour cream and lobster? No way. Yes way! Yum yum yum. 

We'll definitely give it another go, the next time we're looking to be covered in butter, garlic and grins."}
{"text":"MESSY is the theme here. At your table waiting for you is a giant plastic bib and large plastic gloves! No forks and knives! We had to ask for those.

But when at Good Catch, Do as the good catchers do. I was all up in my plastic bag of shrimp mutilating their heads and tails with Cajun sauce flying everywhere.. 

It turned out to be pretty fun! It's a good experience. They serve seafood by the pound in plastic bags just plopped down right in front of you.
I don't know how I feel about plastic around my food, it's a bit of a turn off for me. (Reminds me of dexter)...It does keep all the flavour in there though. I would recommend ordering a plate of rice so you can dump your bag on the rice and mix it. That way you actually get a plate! 

The lobster roll is really good, and it's ready to eat. No prep required by you. I ordered a pound of shrimp with eyeballs, whiskers and everything. It's as if I just shoved my hand in the ocean and pulled out cooked and sauced shrimp. Really fresh, really good. But it takes some work to get all the inedible parts out first. 

The oyster sliders are a MUST. Three decent sized sliders of lightly deep fried oyster. So light and flakey. A little greasy but all worth it. 

The reason there is one less star is because the service was honestly just hectic. Granted it was a Saturday night, but still. I reserved a table that afternoon. Then when I got there at 830 it seemed as though they needed to clear up a spot for us. It's one of these restaurants where you have 5 different people serving you. Everybody does everything kinda vibe. But to us the tone just comes across as \"HELP\", \"DO SOMETHING, ANYTHING\", I wouldn't wanna work there. Chaotic. That's the restaurant business I guess? I dunno. I've definitely seen more organized Saturday nights elsewhere."}
{"text":"Place is big with lots of seating and nice decor.  The boils are similar to most Boil houses but they had more selection of other types of food.  We tried the clams, mussels and snow crab boil in the house sauce.  Can't go wrong with that.  Had a dozen oysters, forgot which ones but they were big and price was good.  Soft shell crab fried rice was really good!  Must try!  However, lobster nachos were not worth the money.  $29.99.  There is a lobster head and tail placed on the nachos but no meat inside.  I assumed it was all in the nachos but I barely found any, only a few pieces here and there.  Service was good.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant pretty later around 10PM however this place has a bar environment and I expected to get a nice seafood item. The food was cold. I liked their creative dishes but it wasn't as great as I would've expected. I had the soft shell crab basket and my dad had the  fish and chips."}
{"text":"Food is good, service was fine.  Ordered the soft shell crab sandwich, which was better than expected.  I wish it came with a little more fries, or the sandwich has a little more something, as it didn't exactly fill me up.  For $12, i wanted it to be a little more satisfying.  

The only thing i would say is that this isn't your typical family restaurant type thing.  It has more like a bar feel.  Lots of TV's showing current sport games, all the staff on floor are females, where they all look good.  Nothing against it, just saying it might not be for everyone.    I'll definitely come back though, food was great, and a little unique.  Some stuff you can't get anywhere else nearby, and its actually pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been to another \"Boil\" restaurant but I wasn't too impressed. This time I was interested in Good Catch Boil House because they seem to serve seafood in various styles.

Our party of three came on a Monday night shortly after the restaurant opened.  Although it is still their soft opening period, both the food quality and presentation were very solid.  Also, our server Carolyn was very sweet and helpful which definitely made our dining experience very enjoyable.

We ordered a different variety of food including fresh shucked oysters (Galway Natives), the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, Oyster Sliders, Lobster Nachos and clams with Good Catch Blend sauce as well as the Curry sauce. The oysters were very fresh and sweet.  The Soft Shell Crab itself was crispy but not too dry.  The mango salsa was a good combination with the crab in the sandwich. Both the Oyster Sliders and Lobster Nachos were very tasty and served with eye-catching presentation and was great to share.  Both the Good Catch Blend sauce and Curry sauce for the Clams were bold and tasty and went well with the clams.

Overall, it was a very satisfying meal. I am glad to have found Good Catch Boil House and I hope their service and food quality will be maintained after their grand opening."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Okay service. I had to track waitress to order, bill & change. I love seafood so I was really hoping to have a great seafood experience. We had clams, oysters and crawfish in the good catch sauce. It was very oily. The clams were good but 1/4 of them were closed. The crawfish was good but there was about 3 eatable crawfish with real meat. The rest were heads and baby crawfish. I love oysters! The order I had was gross. It tasted fishy, grainy and poor quality. You can get better at the supermarket. Overall, it was disappointing seafood experience."}
{"text":"The clams in garlic butter sauce was yummy , tasted fresh. Didn't like the deep fried oysters. Sweet potatoe fries and Cajun fries were hot fresh and tasty! Friend had Cajun soft shell crab and they said it was yummy along with the corn. Service was excellent! Washrooms clean. Great atmosphere. Next time would try lobster nachos."}
{"text":"Good Service. We came right at 5 when they opened. Still had to wait ten minutes as there was a line up of people coming in. 

Super disappointed in the food. We had the gumbo soup was just so so but didn't expect it to be great. We also had clams with the boil house sauce medium. There was zero spice level or flavour just a lot of garlic. Way too much garlic in everything. Same problem with the snow crab legs. The seafood fried rice was just okay. Seafood was fresh compared to Captains Boil 

Super happy they have actual forks and plates. 

All in all I will not go back."}
{"text":"Delicious seafood, fantastic service.  If you are ordering seafood by the pound be prepared to get messy!  Flight beers were great and the price is really reasonable.  We really enjoyed our meal and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Surprised at the rating. Got there and it took 15min for them to figure out who was serving me. They took my order finally. The oysters were great; though, my shrimp was over cooked. The person dropped the bag and ran. I did not see a person my whole meal. I was finished and waited for someone to come, nobody came. I thought, well I will get up and just say bye to the hostesses at the front door to see if they would ask me to pay. They were happy to say bye as I almost walked out without paying!!!! I turned back and asked for my bill, WTF people. Get a minor part of your shit together. Lucky for some honesty still in the world."}
{"text":"Very glad my group of friends decided to come here to watch the McGreggor-Mayweather fight. We reserved in advance and were seated within 10 (not bad for a packed house). 

Parking can be a little tough with the theatre right beside, but the new parking lot on the east side has opened and has tons of more room. 

GC has a really nice venue for all parts of the day. You can come here for lunch but you can also spend the night here until 1 a.m.

We came fairly late (10pm) and we ordered almost exclusively from their happy hour menu options. Unfortunately because I was under the weather I barely ate anything and couldn't have any of their $5 beers, but I'll definitely be trying some of their beers the next time I come (they have a great selection). I ordered the chicken wings which came with Cajun fries, everything tasted decent, no complaints. 

My next review will definitely go further into the food and I will definitely be back here to do that!"}
{"text":"Not bad, nothing exceptional. The service was proper but the shrimp had sodium up the wazoo. Very similar to my experience at Captain's Boil.. average experience."}
{"text":"Very nice seafood restaurant! Food quality is excellent!! All seafood we ordered is fresh and tasty! Price is fair not expensive! Will definitely come back with friends and family!"}
{"text":"During this visit, I only tried a few things so I'm open to coming again to try other dishes and add to my review later on.  They have a huge selection so lots to choose from.  

Food:
Ordered 3 things: Oyster slider burgers, lobster roll and soft shell crab seafood fried rice.  We liked the oyster slider burgers the best in terms of texture and taste.  It was unique and we enjoyed it.  The lobster roll was also very fresh and delicious.  However, the lobster roll was pretty small and it came with sides that were nothing special.  The soft soft shell crab seafood rice was a good idea and we could taste the crunchy bits of sot shell crab but other than that, it was just normal fried rice.  It was okay but no wow factor.  Perhaps, we didn't choose the right dishes.  Maybe next time, I'll try the other side of the menu to try their seafood \"boil\" options.  

Service: 
Great atmosphere, spacious and comfortable seating. Great for coming with a group of friends to sample more dishes and also to just hang out or watch a games from their many TVs.  Service was prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"Having dinner here bump Into friends from high school, also the service and food was great. Great place to chill!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Day... Probably the worst day to head out to dinner but it was fine when we arrived at 8:30. No wait needed and the restaurant was only about half full when we got there. 

We were about to order a few drinks to start, until we were told they had nothing on tap until Friday Feb 17th as they are still under soft opening and still trying to figure things out. Ended up getting bottled beer and soda. 

Ordered 1lb of mussels, 1lb of shrimp, softshell crab basket, oyster sliders and some Wings. We were starving! The good catch sauce for the seafood was really yummy. Not overly garlicky which I liked in comparison to other boil places. The oyster sliders were delicious and actually quite big for sliders. Definitely worth the price. My bf wanted the wings which were okay... But the cajun fries it came with were seasoned very nicely. The soft shell crab was pretty good, but I think would have been better to have it in a sandwich, which I'll come back for and try!

Our server was great and super friendly. Came to check up on us multiple times and made sure we were satisfied with our food. 

To our surprise, there we 10% off our bill because of the soft opening. Overall a great experience and will be back."}
{"text":"I definitely prefer this versus captains boil! Their mussels are really tasty especially with the good catch boil sauce which is the mix! We didn't enjoy the shrimp as much but I would blame that on the choice of sauce. We didn't like the taste of the Szechuan sauce but it depends on your taste! We got the Cajun fries as a side which were pretty basic but a good addition to the seafood. They tasted similar to Costco fries with Cajun spices."}
{"text":"Very nice environment and atmosphere. Convenient location. The garlic butter mussels taste great. Oyster slider was tasty, better to have when it's hot, otherwise a bit greasy. The shrimp was okay but not impressed. Overall a great late night out place!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a great location and it's extremely spacious (family-friendly). All the food is really good - my favourite was the lobster roll and lobster bisque. Apparently their raw oysters are great as well but I'm not a huge fan of them in general. I love love their fries (I'm very picky with my fries) and their beer. I don't remember exactly which one I ordered but it tasted so good, I would go back for just a lobster roll and beer. I am definitely coming back for more! Good catch"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Ordered the shrimps and mussels in good catch blend, oyster sliders, soft shell basket, and Cajun rice. Awesome flavours, definitely go again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and I'm loving it more and more! My first visit was on the first day the lunch menu was launched. I visited around 12:30pm and the server told us we were the first ones there today. We ordered the lobster mac & cheese, lobster grilled cheese, avocado grilled cheese, and lobster nachos. The lobster nachos was loaded with lots and lots of cheese with lobster bits scattered around. I would say it's a little heavy for an appetizer especially because everything else we ordered had cheese, but it wouldn't be such of a problem if everything else was less cheesy. Everything else was very delicious. We left around 2pm and there was still only 3 tables. 

Today we visited again around 12 and this place was packed (Father's Day). This time we ordered the soft shell crab fried rice, fish sliders, oyster sliders, beef poke bowl with zoodles, and the lobster supreme (the yelp). I personally preferred the fish sliders over the oyster. The lobster supreme was a little cold when it arrived, but I understand that it's a busy day and it might've sat a bit before being served. The beef from the poke bowl is very high quality and perfectly seasoned. The servers are always very friendly and helpful. Left at around 2pm and there was still people waiting for a table! 

5 stars for sure! I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The location of this restaurant is on point. It's right in the center of Downtown Markham. Parking sometimes may be hard to find during peak movie days (i.e. Tuesdays, Friday, and Weekends). That's the only down fall. It's located right in front of the Cineplex Markham VIP theaters. I drove by everyday almost on the way to home wondering when it would open. I even tried to walk over once after a movie to grab a bite to eat, but they weren't quite open yet. 

They finally opened 2 weeks ago and got their Liquor license. I believe they are still at their soft opening and you can receive 20% off your bill or by checking-in on Yelp. The decor and size of this restaurant is huge. They weren't too busy when I went, which is always nice. 

I went for the Oyster Mini Sliders. It came with 3 mini burgers. It was amazing! I would never have thought to put fried oysters in a burger. It was a good portion, but I would recommend a side of fries if you're really hungry. 

They also feature many local craft beers on tap, which is amazing. Unfortunately, when I went they did not have the beer delivered yet so that was a bit disappointing for me. It just means that I'll have to go back again. They have a flights for $10, which is quite reasonable if you want to test out the different types of beer they have. 

My friends did get the 1LBS of shrimp and enjoyed it. In terms of their seafood in a bag I don't see that much of a difference in comparison to Captain's boils or the Boil Bar. It's quite similar, so hopefully they stand out with the other items in their menu. 

Overall, I would recommend this location to others to try! Hopefully their service speeds up with time because they're located close to a theater and a lot of people go there before the movies to grab a bite and speed will be important."}
{"text":"The clams with Szechuan sauce is the best I've ever had!!!
Also the oysters are fresh enough.
Great experience:)"}
{"text":"Good catch boil house was a great find.  They had several different choices of boiled and steamed seafood as well as sushi.  They also had an assortment of fried foods.  I had the fish and chips and some seafood gumbo.  The gumbo was especially delicious but the fish and chips were also great as well.  Service was fast and friendly.  The atmosphere was casual with lots of TVs all tuned to the maple leafs in the playoffs this particular night.  I will certainly be back the next time I am back in Toronto."}
{"text":"MANNN DO I LOVE MYSELF SOME SEAFOOD! 

Impressed with the quality and versatile spices that can really accommodate to everyone's tastebuds. I got shrimp, clams and mussels and can say that the clams aren't worth trying but the other two are MUST-HAVES!! Other than the seafood, they also have good selections of finger foods or mains!! I was with a party of 5 and we also got nachos and chicken wings too share. 

If i'm being honest, 3 pounds of seafood and 2 appetizers were not enough to make us full but the price was about $20 each! If you're looking to indulge in seafood but not get a full belly out of it, then by all means! But if you're really hungry, I don't think this type of meal is right for you unless you're really willing to splurge! I would definitely come back to get their famous lunch menu finds such as the poke bowl and mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a birthday party, where my friend has booked off the back section for 40 people. Guests (including babies) arrived gradually and the seating experience was organized and roomy. Servers came and took orders from each table, I was quite surprised to see that everything was pretty much in order, everyone knew what they were doing. Some restaurants really struggle whenever they have big parties so this experience speaks for itself.

Food all came pretty quickly after we ordered:
Oyster Sliders - GOOD OYSTERS combining with the buttery bun ahh yummy!!!
Lobster roll - good amount of lobster, with bread, fries, and Caesar salad - I still consider $20 very steep altho lobster is tasty
Clams in Szechuan sauce - sauce is really tasty, flavorful with heat but clams are too small
Mussels in garlic butter with corns - mussels are good size but sauce is a bit blend, butter corns were yummy, well spent $1 add-on

Lesson learned: Do mussels + corns with Szechuan sauce!! Keep the oysters sliders too!! 

The restaurant is very thoughtful that there are hand-washing stations in the dining area so you do not need to go to the washroom everytime you want to clean your hands.

Lastly, they play UFC fights there!! Who would have expected!? No minimum charge for that either (at least the night for a GSP fight when I was there) Imagine licking your fingers while watching a good fight : ) Would love to come back for all of the above reasons."}
{"text":"I had expectations for this place to be as good as captains boil since the whole market for these boil houses are getting more and more popular. I usually don't give out two stars but I feel like this needed it. A couple of things that happened during my visit last night on Friday but before I start this review here's what we ordered for a group of three: Cajun fries, soft shell crab basket, lobster nachos, a lb of mussel in garlic butter and a lb of shrimp in good catch sauce. Here goes..,
1. On Fridays I don't meat. Seafood is fine but no meat (religious reasons). I wanted to try the gumbo and asked the server if there's any meat in the gumbo and she says \"No, I'm pretty sure it's all just seafood\" and then she insists with checking with her manager. Manager comes and says \"yea, it's all just seafood like clams and lobster, etc.\" So I ask again \"are you sure there's no BEEF, CHICKEN, or PORK?\" And he's like \"yea for sure it's all seafood\". Gumbo arrives first to the table since it's a soup/starter. My first spoonful had sausage bits in it...please tell me how this can happen after asking two staff members...well.. ladies and gentlemen this is how
2. We ordered the lobster nachos and the amount of lobster was disappointing. The plating had a full lobster head and tail but when we checked the lobster tail it was empty and on the nachos were very small bits of lobster which did not equate to one full lobster
3. On the shrimp you could tell it's frozen just by biting into it not exactly a problem since it's cheap and you kinda know already since the menu doesn't have MP beside the shrimp. The GC sauce was kinda disappointing since it was watered down. I would say captains boil sauce is better. Also when they ask you how spicy you want it just go for medium for that kick. Mild does nothing 
4. When paying for the bill, I figured this looked like such An upscalish place in downtown Markham they might take Amex. Asked our server if they take Amex and she's like yea of course. Hands me the machine and of course Amex doesn't work. 

All in all the restaurant had comfortable seating which I always appreciated and they play sports games on the tv. I would have given them two star rating if it weren't for the spacious seating since the fck ups add up. Overall I think they need to train their staff to manager customer expectations better in order to provide a seamless dining experience. The only dish I would really recommend would be the soft shell crab basket. On top i would really only come back here to catch a game and chill on a beer."}
{"text":"Thumbs down to management.  If our dining experience was based only on the food and our immediate server, I would've reviewed Good Catch at 4 stars:  our waitress was friendly, the seafood was fresh, plump, and clean (we had raw clams on the half shell with zero grit or sand).

Problem is that there was just such an obvious lack of training and general restaurant management that showed all through the evening for us:

- We were told no reservations were accepted on weekends, only to find out upon arrival that 
reservations are actually accepted for parties over 6 guests. 

- Tables were empty at the front of the house, but we were told we couldn't have them as they were reserved.  Fine.  But when they were still empty more than 45 minutes later, we asked if we could have it since the party was clearly not showing up.  After much pushback, we were told fine, we can have the table, but we had to be finished by an hour.  Seriously? They should just give us the table and give the late \"reserved\" party the next table then. Why lose the customers you have waiting right in front of you to keep the table for an extremely late party that may never arrive at all?

- Our server didn't know whether the crayfish was frozen or fresh; nor did she know the market prices of the daily catches.  I get the feeling that management never bothers to do a pre-opening meeting / staff huddle nor do they prep the server with info before starting their shift. I don't blame our server at all, she was really nice, but this is basic restaurant procedure that the managers should've been well aware of.  At least post boards throughout the restaurant then that display the market price.

- Busboys who brought out food wouldn't bother placing food in front of the guest, and instead would stand at the front of the table and say \"Hey, pass this down.\" while handing off the dishes (at times, not even saying a word and simply dropping off a bag or dish at the head of the table).  Basically, they were too lazy to walk around the table to actually serve the food.

If the management could just address these issues and just fix the way they run things a little, I can see so much potential in The Good Catch. Until then, for me, this isn't Good..."}
{"text":"I love this place, their mini oyster sliders are sooo good. The good catch sauce will have you craving to come back. I've had the lobster, mussels, shrimps, oyster sliders, and everything was good. 

Waitresses could be more attentive, but overall I love this place.

Great location in downtown Markham with the cineplex, go4tea, and spacious parking lot. I like that there is an area to walk around after a meal."}
{"text":"This is my second time at a boil spot, really trying to like it! Got the Poke Bowl, and my Mom got the snow crab legs with cajun seafood rice. All were delicious! Very messy to eat. The cajun fries are like fried sticks - not a fan of these at all. The waitress comped us in the end for these which was awesome! We were happy! 
Overall, good experience this place is a little cleaner than most but there were still marks on the booth walls.. needs to be cleaned!"}
{"text":"Must Try: Crab, Crab Legs, Clams & Mussels with Good Catch Blend Sauce at Medium spice with Corn and Vermicelli, Oyster Sliders, Poke Bowl (lunch only), Craft Beers

Rating: (9/10) Food, (8/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (10/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  
Been here several times, and it's one of the top 'boil houses' on my list. Amongst this boil house craze and all the countless boil/harbour/catch restaurants popping up, Good Catch stands above them by maintaining quality seafood with quality sauce. 

I've been to the boil houses in California in which these restaurants are inspired by, and the key difference is most boil houses don't offer the quality seafood that the California counter-parts offer. Good Catch recognizes this distinction and maintains high quality offerings. 

Of course the 'seafood in bag' is the main attraction (catch my fav combo up top), but their oyster sliders are also delicious, along with the crab fried rice. 

Great for a group gathering or going out to watch a sporting event. Their bar is very underrated and the large number of tv's everywhere make it a great bar to watch the game. Plus they're open very late, so you'll be able to watch everything including the over time.

Although it is not a cheap adventure, you will not be disappointed by the offerings of this establishment."}
{"text":"Expensive..... Nothing special compared to the other restaurants. 

But most of all.... The service was horrible. It took over 2 hours to finish eating. Everytime we asked the server for water, it's at least 10 mins and it took over 30 mins to get the bill. She brought the bill, we asked for machine.... 10 mins, she brought it and said hold on and disappeared. It's impossible to leave!! 

It was so frustrating that I'll never go back there. The server was also very annoying with sales. When we asked for her opinion between two items, she said why not both? And said, here just get it and ordered it for us and left before we could say no. Who does that?? 


Overall, very unimpressed, don't think they're genuine or caring servers. To me, food is nothing without service. Especially when it's not even cheap...."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner a couple times and this place never disappoints!  The seafood is always fresh and menu has a wide selection of options that everyone always finds something they enjoy!  Portions are quite big and prices are fair considering it's seafood!  As a beer lover, I also appreciate the decent selection of beers on tap!  The restaurant itself is spacious and big, and also very clean (which is important since the eating style here is the \"roll up your sleeves\" and \"wear gloves to dig in\" type).  And service is amazing - very friendly, always promptly acknowledged and they are quick to clean your table and fill up your glass!

My only con for this place is that it's not very environmentally friendly, since they give you plastic bibs and gloves to eat and most of the seafood is served in plastic bags.  I'm not a big fan of this serving style - but definitely a fan of the food!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3 1/2 stars. I took my mom here for Mother's Day, and it was pretty good! Our waitress was super friendly and the atmosphere was great. 
I think that the shrimp in our combo bag wasn't that fresh. 
Pretty expensive.
I got the lobster nachos, combo c, and snow crabs. 
The lobster nachos is really big and for 2 people we order too much! 
They don't have a lot of clamps for the snow crab... it took a while till we were able to eat it. Also, the snow crab didn't arrive till we were almost finished the other food."}
{"text":"Food is amazing every time, been here 3 times already. Only bad comment is the servers waited 20min before anyone asked us what we wanted to drink."}
{"text":"The mussels with garlic butter is good. The boil house has a good selection of flavours (compared to the other places) but the lobster is not worth the price. However, the shrimp and the other selections besides the seasonal menu items are reasonably priced. The lobster bisque is good. I do recommend coming here, it's one of my favourites among the other boil houses."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night and waited approximately half an hour for a table for two. I believe it opened recently considering the enormous amount of people waiting.

Food 3/5
We ordered the highly rated oyster slider, fish and chips, gumbo and a bag of the mussels in good catch blend. The oyster sliders was definitely the favourite and most unique item compared to the rest. The fried oyster was proportion sized \"patty\" for the slider which meant you had a piece in every bite. The sliders also included fried onions that added to the sweetness and a tangy sauce that helped cut the grease. Fish and chips were fairly basic, it came with two decent sized pieces of fish that were flaky and not overly fried. Gumbo had a nice smokey flavour when you first taste it but fades and becomes bland. However it does come with generous pieces of ingredients such as shrimp and okra. Finally the bagged seafood was nothing to rave about. It's nothing special compared to its competitors except for the different flavoured sauce. The good catch blend had a nice spicy kick but wasn't as flavourful and garlicky compared Captain's Boil. 

Service 4/5
Our server was nice and friendly. Although it was a busy night she still found the time to check up on us in between our meal. 

All in all it was a good meal. The four items came to $60 pre-tax. It would be a great place to eat before or after a movie but I wouldn't purposely make a trip to eat there. If you do eat at Catch I would recommend eating the boiled seafoods at the competitors and trying the more unique items on the back."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, but I already love it! For seafood in a bag.. Captains Boil would definitely have been my go to. But after trying this place, it's my new favourite. Not because of the taste, because it honestly tastes exactly the same to me. The menu at Good Catch is much larger! Such a greater selection. 

I've only tried a few things on their menu, such as the Salmon Poke Bowl (they now have lunch), Lobster Roll & Oyster Sliders. The Salmon Poke Bowl is delicious. I got it with teriyaki as my sauce and with sushi rice. I also tried their spicy mayo sauce, which makes the poke bowl taste just like sushi, but it's way too spicy to me. The lobster roll was good. Although it was packed with lobster, I actually couldn't taste it too much. The bread was covering it all. Not complaining though, overall it was still delicious. Very buttery. For someone who doesn't like oysters, I wasn't too mad about the Oyster Sliders. Very unique to put oysters in a burger, but it works."}
{"text":"Good Catch is located on the north side of the plaza, on the reverse side of Golf Town and Curry's. You can park in the back parking lot and walk around. A typical nautical themed decor but surprisingly spacious and has a good vibe. Lots of TVs around the place which is great for catching a game. 

There are a variety of choices on the menu which aren't by the pound - oyster slider, soft shell crab, lobster sandwich etc, but the star of the show is definitely the seafood in a baggie with their delicious sauces.  You order shrimp/crawfish/clams/crab by the pound and choose from a variety of sauces. I'm a big fan of the butter garlic sauce! You can add a variety of sides into the bag (potato, corn, sausage, etc) which all sound great but will add up.  I've tried adding them all in various sauce and must say the sausage and corn option is a bit of a rip-off - it's $6.96 to add sausage and it's around 1 whole sausage cut into bits. The corn is $2 and you get about 1/3 of a cob.  

For those with a bit of an appetite, the extra option to add rice or vermicelli is a must!  For $2/$3, the rice will fill you up and will taste absolutely amazing with the sauce in the baggie.

Items that are not yet available on their menu - raw bar, crawfish, lobster nachos."}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends for lunch and ordered lobster with nacho chips. To me this item is over price. I couldn't find too many lobster meat but the dish was covered with a lot of nachos and cheese, olives and chilies. When found a piece lobster meat, it's soooo salty. I came to this place before and the food they serve is not that bad. Perhaps this item is not done to my liking. I will come back for other items at another time."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner and have been happy with the food they've been serving up. On both occasions, I ordered their oysters sliders (incredibly delicious). Their soft shell crab basket and lobster roll wasn't worth the price and wasn't that good.

The service is great and the restaurant is large and spacious - can easily accommodate large parties! Would definitely return to try their seafood boil in the future."}
{"text":"Nice oyster bar selection. Service is friendly and pleasant atmosphere. Location is great with the vip theatre close by.

Lobster nachos is a must try!"}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions and hands down, when all the other \"pretenders\" in the boil seafood madness die out, Good Catch will be the only one left standing - remember who said that first.

Why, you ask?

First off, let's talk about the core offering here - Seafood in bags boiled with sauces of your choosing. Sure lots of other places are doing it, but Good Catch's sauce is fresh and flavorful and unlike other experiences, didn't leave me with a bad case of heartburn afterwards. The seafood even tasted fresher than others.

Next up, their menu isn't just all about the Boil seafood, they've diversified, offering amazing fusion menu items that transcend simply sauce seafood and a buttered biscuit. Items such as lobster nachos featuring not just the meat but the ENTIRE lobster. Other standouts would be their sandwiches which include a personal favourite like a softshell crab sandwich - which is transcendent.

Third, the bar. Oh, their glorious bar. Unlike all others, the owners here have taken as much detail curating their craft beer menu and bar as they have their food menu. Craft breweries from all over the province are fairly represented in abundance here. I have yet to investigate if they have decent wine or cocktail options but for now, I'm more than comfortable cosying up to any craft beer of my choosing.

Lastly, the venue. They've made a location that you actually WANT to hang out at. Between nightly specials to massive television screens to watch live events and large comfy booths, this has and will continue to be THE place to hang out in the newly minted Downtown Markham."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time..the staff was cool ...and got the cajun seafood fried rice and a soft shell crab sandwich...n both wer amazing. I think the cajun fried rice just needed to be a bit more spicy but dats it.....and another cool thing is that they got a big ass popeye statue standin in the middle of the restaurant. Id go back for sure...yeeeaah"}
{"text":"The best boil house in Toronto. Not as tasty at captains boil but MUCH less oil & salt. At captains boil (although I'm a huge fan of their captains mix) I am only able to get through 5 pieces of shrimp till I feel full & gross. Here my bf and I shared a pound of shrimp, mussels and a chicken tender basket and I was able to eat everything! Everything was so good, not oily, and great level of spice (we got the house mix & medium). Chicken and Cajun fries were great, love my skinny fries (although menu shows thicker fries)! Atmosphere and environment amazing as well- younger crowd that's still suitable for families, and more practical environment. You're given a hanging bucket to throw away scraps & food comes super fast despite us eating at prime time during a basketball game. Also my experience started at the time I made the reso- they were so accommodating! I made  last minute a reso at 8pm for two, in time for the raptors play off game. The hostess was so nice and even though they were full, she managed to squeeze me in and told me if the table wasn't avail when we got there we had reserved bar seats as well. She even seated us directly in front of the largest TV in the restaurant. Great experience and my boyfriend and I plan to continually come back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food and drinks are great. Especially like the prawns steamed on the Good Catch sauce. So good!!"}
{"text":"Seafood served in a \"shake and mix\" style.
There's a variety of seafood and flavour options but this type of cuisine isn't for me. Regardless of flavours, I find them salty. The prices are on the higher end, I prefer to spend my money elsewhere. There are plenty of restaurants that serve good seafood dishes for a more reasonable price.

I prefer their other dishes that arent served in a bag. Particularly the lobster nachos, it is completely loaded with all the nachos toppings you need + all the necessary dips. This is the only item I would come back for again and again. For this dish alone, I'd give it a 4 but overall, this restaurant is a 3 for me."}
{"text":"so much better than captains boil. We tried the lobster nachos, soft shell crab sammy, mussels with good catch blend, a dozen kushi oysters(real nice oysters) and the lobster roll with butter. The best of the dishes was the mussels and lobster roll. I would skip the soft shell crab sammy it sounds better than it really is. This is the best seafood boil house so far ill be back for sure!
......i made the mistake of eating the green goop (tomalley)from the lobster head which is supposed to be a delicacy *my dad eats it all the time*, he can keep his delicacy it taste like how a old fish tank smells but this place is a yes!"}
{"text":"Haven't visit this restaurant for awhile and this place still so busy on a Friday night. Saw the lobster roll on menu and it's good but very strong in garlic butter. But it has a lot of lobster in it so it's good. Soft shell crab is good as usual. For me I think some of the food on menu is a bit over priced but then again it's seafood and as long as it's fresh then it's good."}
{"text":"Great food, been there a couple times. Never get disappointed. Seafood there is really fresh and tasty. My favourite is lobster nacho and oysters~"}
{"text":"Food was yummy! I love seafood so I was in heaven. I loved the good catch blend sauce (get suicide level if you want it to be spicy! The regular version is NOT spicy at all)! We ordered snow crab legs, shrimp, mussels and clams. Clams were my favourite (easy to eat lol) so we ordered that twice. Also ordered the oyster sliders and lobster nachos. The only thing I wouldn't order again would be the lobster nachos as there weren't very many pieces of lobster for it to be priced at $30. Lots of seating space as well and our waitress was very friendly!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 4 is because they took Crawfish off the menu, and are still contemplating whether they should keep it on. It's not entirely their fault, as I can imagine the good folks of Markham not being too crazy about working hard for a tiny bit of meat, but a good Boil house needs to serve Crawfish on the menu! Maybe order less, for those select customers, or allow them to call ahead to order...

Anyway, so we settled on getting the Shrimp (house sauce) and the Clams (garlic butter sauce).

The House sauce is good, it's less thick and salty than other places, and has a ton of garlic in it, so you know it's flavorful. 

The portions are decent, had the soft shell crab which came with Cajun fries - both great. Also had some oysters (Kumomotos and Raspberry Points) which were both awesome. Very small, and pricey, but delish!

Atmosphere is great for catching a game as there's tons of flat screen tv's, and the resto is big enough to easily seat 6-8 guests on any occasion.

Decent price (cheaper than usual), and friendly waitstaff. Would come again!"}
{"text":"Review is based on their media launch, which was very well planned.  I had the opportunity to meet bloggers and instagrammers and tasted almost over 10-12 items on their menu!  What generosity!

Location/Service:
Right in the heart of downtown Markham.  It's in the same complex with Cineplex VIP - but the restaurant is right on the side.  Parking can get a little tough when it's busy, especially during Tues nights.  Hopefully the lot gets expanded soon.

Inside the restaurant is huge!  I love their decor - bright lights, wide open space to the bar and kitchen.  They do have a full bar with local beer, perfect to swing by late nights to catch up with friends or watch a sports game.

All staff were very friendly - making sure we have the samplers to try and drinks.  They were also quick and accommodating with any requests/help we have on the menu items.

Food:
Because I ate so many items, I'll review some of the ones I remember and with good pictures.

Oyster Sliders - possibly one of the BEST item.  Although they are sliders, it was a handful to eat.  The oysters were fried to perfection (juicy and crisp) - matching so well with the deep fried onions and mayo.  Highly recommended to try.

Chicken Wings - tried both honey garlic and cajun flavor.  Honey garlic was loaded with the honey, sweet and tender while the cajun had a little bit of spice to kick things up.

Good Catch Slaw - this gigantic salad has 18 ingredients incorporated.  Perfect to share and a nice appetizer to start, as all the ingredients are fresh - opening up the palate and appetite.

Lobster Roll with cold mayo - good portion of the actual lobster meat.  You can taste it's still very fresh and soft.  This comes with an option with butter, which I actually like it better.  Cajun fries on the side, also a good spice to regular fries.

Cajun Seafood Fried Rice - massive carb loader.  The seafood mixed well with the rice - and again the cajun adds a little kick.

Other items (with no pictures) include Gumbo Soup, Dungeness Crab mixed in Curry Sauce, Clams/Mussels in Garlic Butter/Cajun and fresh Oysters.

Overall, I liked Good Catch because it's not just a bag of seafood type of restaurant.  They have sandwiches/chicken wings/salad & soup - with good sharing portions.  It's a perfect place to come either with families, friends or late nights."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place of its kind to visit. Compared to the many others available in the area, this is easily the best. 

We ordered the snow crab legs and mussels with a side of corn and brussel sprouts, and the lobster nachos. 

Normally, I'm not a fan of snow crab legs as I find them needing much work with little reward but these were an exception. They cracked easily with large chunks of meat inside. We got these with the garlic sauce which complimented the crab legs well. 

The mussels were delicious, though I naturally love them. We got these with their good catch blend sauce, which I highly recommend. It had the perfect balance of sweet and spicy, though it wasn't overwhelming which is good. 

The corn was okay but the brussel sprouts were large and cooked perfectly, which I found pleasantly shocking. 

Lastly, we had the lobster nachos. Yes, it was pretty pricey for nachos but it is so worth it. The presentation was nice to look at and the portion was huge. It came with a generous amount of dips and toppings. I especially loved the big chunks of lobster in the dish. 

While these restaurants do run on higher prices, Good Catch Boil House was worth every dollar spent."}
{"text":"Yum! I love eating boiled seafood in a bag. I've been to Good Catch Boil House twice now and enjoyed both visits. Service is good here and the food always comes out relatively fast.

Ordering shrimp at these establishments is always a no-brainer for me because they soak up all of the sauce and they are meaty enough to be filling. No complaints about the shrimp here! I've also tried the snow crab legs which are pricier but surprisingly contain a good amount of meat too. Be sure to get the Good Catch Blend which is just a mix of the other sauces they offer. I also like to order sides of corn which are delicious and conveniently thrown into the bag of seafood!

I've also tried their soft shell crab rice which is okay but not something I would order again because I think other places make it better. I find that the one here is a bit bland and doesn't really contain too much soft shell crab!

Chicken wings are decent and their cajun fries are great - note that they are the skinnier kind and I recommend using the Good Catch Blend sauce as a dip for them.

Would definitely come back once in awhile for some yummy, albeit messy, seafood."}
{"text":"Actually enjoyed our stay here while dining at this type of establishment for the first time - as in.. since I was a baby I don't remember the last time I've ever had to wear a bib while eating something. But anyway, my experience was positive, therefore I give this place a high rating.

I ordered a bag of shrimps with the house sauce, and a lobster roll meal for $22! The lobster roll was pretty amazing and it had just the right amount of butter, everything was covdered. The only thing I will say is that I just wished that the bread was more harder and crunchier - that would have offset really well paired with the soft lobster bits. The meal came with a salad and fries, and both were done pretty well, even for standard dishes.

Although it was a busy night, our waitress came and we were promptly served and attended to throughout the night so I appreciate that. Would recommend and come back for that lobster roll!"}
{"text":"Although it is a boil house, I love its poke bowl and snakes very much. I have been there for several times, and I really recommend you guys to try its lobster sandwich, and oyster sandwich. The price is reasonable, and the interior decoration is very fun with a big Popeye sculpture."}
{"text":"This is a great seafood joint fairly priced and a great social atmosphere. 

For a light meal go for a pound of the seafood and add some corn in the bag too- it sucks up all the flavours and is delicious!

We tried the spicy schezuan (medium- but we could have gone up) good catch blend (mad/spicy). 1 lb of shrimp had like 10-12 shrimp which was perfect. 

I'd suggest that they give a straw with water/drinks so it's a handsfree experience!"}
{"text":"Honestly I love coming to here with my friends and family. Great food, great service and the ambience is great! Many tv's around to see a variety of games as you eat. Highly suggest having their Burger Sliders and Chicken Wings for the non-seafood eater, mussels and shrimp (King crab legs for bigger spendings) for the bucket and their Soft Shell crab fried rice :) Definitely love their Raw Cherry Stones and oysters. Highly recommended place to eat"}
{"text":"this is definitely not bad place to hang out with friends but their food quality is is quite poor. I got the oyster sliders and soft shell crab (i think sandwiches, i can't remember) and i really do enjoy the taste but it was so incredibly oily. there was very little actual soft shell crab/oyster within the outer fried layer and i felt really gross after. my mom even tried soaking some oil out of it on a tissue and the tissue just got completely soaked with oil and the piece of food was still left glistening with oil. overall i wouldn't return voluntarily but with friends i wouldn't strongly reject."}
{"text":"Do not order soft shell crab sandwich. It's HEAVILY BREADED AND soggy! Salad was also very soggy and oddly seasoned, corns just tasted like boiled corns with raw garlic."}
{"text":"First time dining here today. We finished our movie early and waited at a neighbouring clothing store until they opened at 5pm. 

We ordered the cold lobster roll (cold comes with mayo and the warm comes with butter, SO prefers mayo) and the soft shell crab basket. The cold lobster roll had a bit too much mayo and sort of masked the flavour of the lobster. We also had the soft shell crab basket that came with 1 pc of soft shell crab and Cajun fries. The fries were very good and the crab was delicious. We were both filled and didn't get to try our other choices.
 
The decor was pub like and the table setup followed other seafood boil places. Unlike the other places, they have craft beer and serve different types of raw oysters if you're into that.

Will update this review further once we have tried some of the boiled seafood, oyster sliders, and lobster nachos."}
{"text":"This new joint only does dinner, I find their sauce to be on the saltier side. For party of 2 the bill came up to almost 100. Order pound of shrimp, mussel, snow crab, oyster slider and soft shell crab basket plus 2 drinks. Snow crab I felt ripped off as I only got half a crab while when I was at a competitor's I got a lot more. Other portion seems to be right. Oyster slider is a must try"}
{"text":"TL;DR One of the better eat-your-seafood-by-hand places because of the service. It makes your food more enjoyable but expect this place to have inconsistent  textures and flavours as this place is quite relatively new. Their oyster bar is a one up.

Food (2.5/5)
Oh how far you've fallen since when I first met you. This place had great promise, great flavours, and wonderful dishes. As time grew up they began to revert their unique salads to what it seems like lettuce out of a bag and sauce out of the bottle to save time and money probably. Their seafood was perfect but they seem quite pre-boiled and kept in a heating compartment, either that or the seafood they get now is that bad. The cajun fries are ok, the sweet potato ones are better (extra $$$). The sauces have went from HELLA SALTY WITH A HINT OF FLAVOUR to a little less salty. Ormaybe I've been coming back too often now that my tastebuds have gotten used to the salt? Not quite sure anymore.

Oyster bar (4/5)
Quick, clean, fresh oysters. I knocked off a point cause of the lack of sauces but it isn't their main attraction anyways.

Alcohol (3/5) 
Quite the variety with my favourite Side Launch Bavarian Wheat Beer, they even have an 11$ special thay features 4 or 5 beers that are all 5 oz so you get to taste what they have on tap, great idea! But nothing too flashy as they don't do cocktails (lmao why this is so sad hire a bartender for the love of the Oyster Bar).

Atmosphere (3/5)
It's definately going in the direction of a fisherman's sports bar with all the cute decor ranging from giant crabs to little shipping containers for your napkins and lighthouse lamps. However the music is dreadful. It's basically a Spotify playlist on Canada's Top 50 or someones EDM playlist that I CAN LITERALLY NAME EVERY SONG. This is a place for either every basic raver's dream who's life career is fishing.

Service (5/7)
These waitresses are absolutely lovely, so far I only see one familar face everytime I go and unfortunately I do not like her (sorry) or the guys. I quite frankly dont think they even interact with customers ever (I'm talking about the dudes) as all the times I've gone they're usually just hitting on the girls and then runaway to the kitchen or bar when a customer approaches them; worst case scenerio a customer talks to them and it's the same old line \"let me get someone to help you :) and bashfully skid away in their adidas sneakers. The other unfamilar faces that come and go however are very delightful beauties who are very sweet and nice. Wishing you well ladies!"}
{"text":"I received an invite to attend their media day, where attendees are mostly bloggers, instagrammers, or other media personnel. I've been going to more of these events and find one thing in common amongst all the participants, their cameras \"eat first\" lols. Anyhow, cool people, different culture. Who am I kidding? I do the same thing! Except my pictures suck haha.

Event
This was extremely well planned, I felt like a total celebrity. I just want to stress that the restaurant probably went all out. So much food! Not to mention, all you can drink booze! Everyone was greeted with appetizers and FREE oysters at the bar. And you know how I could tell I was a newbie? They already had a table set with food so that bloggers could snap their shots. Blinding light flashes, damn. Later in the night, people were divided into groups and sat with 3-5 other individuals and had a tasting menu. I was so full. Even when we were leaving, the restaurant gave us coupons and gifts. I was in awe.

Food
I ate too much, can't even remember half of it lols. To be fair, this restaurant has a good amount of variety but their selling points are definitely the seafood dishes. Now, I did come back to the restaurant on a normal day when I wasn't treated as a celebrity lol. Their service was good, super busy on a weekend, and waitresses were attentive and nice. Checkmark on service please!

Here are my recommendations if you plan to make a visit:
- Fried oyster sliders (I believe this is like 8.5/10 in taste)
- The bagged seafood (Their house sauce is quite good)

Everything else in my opinion was mediocre. I would probably avoid the salad because it's a little bland."}
{"text":"Arriving around 9pm on a Thursday, the restaurant was not packed and we were seated after 5 minutes. We ordered 1lb of snow crab legs in Good Catch Blend sauce (medium spiciniess) with 2 pieces of corn, 1lb of mussels in Szechuan sauce (medium spiciness) with potatoes, and Lobster Nachos.
The freshness of the seafood were average and the mussels were slightly chewy. We loved the Good Catch Blend sauce but the Szechuan sauce fell short. It tasted like hot pot soup base and was oily. Nevertheless, both sauces were at satisfying spicy levels.
The size of the Lobster Nachos was large as we (two people) couldn't finish it. The lobster meats did not seem fresh, but they were acceptable. Nothing too special about the nachos in general.
When we finished our meal, we could not find any servers nearby and when we finally asked for the bill, the service was slow. The waitress apologized and it was very nice of her to offer us more salsa as we were taking away the remaining nachos.
Overall, food was nothing extraordinary while service is slow. Would not highly recommend."}
{"text":"We have been to Good Catch a few times now and service and food has been very inconsistent.

Our first visit was not a pleasant experience as we had to wait over an hour for our food. We followed up with our waitress a few times, and she finally realized our order never went into the system. She did apologize and said she would offer us a discount, in which at the end of the night, we were given a laughable 10% off. But despite that, we still ended up coming back to the restaurant because when the food finally arrived, it was delicious. Sadly, the food went on a downhill spiral in our subsequent visits.

- We have tried different combinations of seafood and sauces including shrimp ($13.95), clams ($13.95) and mussels ($11.95). Again, each visit was very inconsistent.  The seafood was very fresh and cooked to perfection the first time around. During our more recent visits, the mussels were overcooked and chewy, and some shrimps were slightly mushy, indicating that they were no longer fresh. As for the clams, they were tiny and we didn't find much protein in the 1 lb bag. 

- Good Catch Slaw ($18.95) - The salad came with a variety of raw ingredients and a basic berry vinaigrette dressing (a bit too basic in my opinion). The portions were pretty good, but it was nothing memorable and we didn't feel like it was worth the price.

- Oyster sliders ($13.95) - We really enjoyed these the first time around. The bun was slightly sweet and the fragrant fried onions added a very nice flavour. However, the second time around, the quality greatly deteriorated. We were served soggy and oily fried onions, and this wasn't even on a busy night.  

- Soft shell crab sandwich ($12.95) -  We didn't particularly like this sandwich as the flavours were pretty flat. You mostly just taste sweetness from the mango salsa. 

- Chicken tender basket ($8.95) - This was pretty good value as it came with 4 or 5 pieces of chicken tenders and curly fries on the side. The curly fries were quite tasty.
  
- Combo A ($25.95) - This would have been a great deal if the seafood was actually fresh and not overcooked. You get 2 pounds of seafood (1lb mussels + 1 lb shrimps), 1 potato and 1 corn, with a choice of 1 sauce for both types of seafood.

-  Sauces - The garlic butter, good catch blend (this can be a bit spicy if you can't take heat) and the lemon pepper sauces were all delicious but be prepared to drink loads of water after. With such flavourful sauces, I can't imagine MSG not being one of the key ingredient. 

Overall, we do enjoy the menu and atmosphere here. However, based on our last two visits, we're in no rush to come back unless they start making some improvements."}
{"text":"A large group of us went here one evening for dinner. The interior of Good Catch is quite welcoming and we were able to get two large tables next to each other. Service was excellent! And we really enjoyed the experience (it can get quite messy!) 

When we ordered, the sliders were not available so we had the calamari appetizer. It was a nice hearty portion, but what really stole the show was that lobster with their house sauce! Must try! We also had mussels with a mild curry sauce, which was quite delicious as well (not too spicy, more of a thai curry flavour). It came to about $50 per person, which is about standard for this kind of cuisine. Would come back to try those sliders!"}
{"text":"I was here during their soft opening.

FOOD: 4/5 - This is how this place works: you pick the kind of shellfish from their menu and then choose a flavour to go with it. You could also customize the level of spiciness to suit your taste. Then, your shellfish is boiled in a Cajun-style spice blend and tossed in the flavour you selected.

While you're waiting for your food, you could get ready by wearing their plastic bibs and gloves. Because the eating scene could get a little messy. They serve their seafood in clear plastic bags. At first glance, it might look like one of your organic wastes. But once you get your hands (gloves) dirty, you cannot stop! I love their Good Catch Blend sauce! It was so flavourful and garlicky. I wished I didn't have my gloves on so I could lick all the sauce off my fingers! We also had their Cajun sauce and Garlic Butter. Both of these sauces were tasty and complement well with the seafood. To add in the mix, we also ordered some soft shell crab basket and Cajun fries. 

The restaurant also offers a bit of other non-seafood choices, like sliders, wings and chicken tenders.

ENVIRONMENT: 5/5 - The space is open and inviting, with large TV screens everywhere broadcasting sports. I especially appreciate all the little details that they put into their branding and décor. 

SERVICE: 4/5 - Attentive and friendly. Our server did regular check up on us and took the time to explain the menu to us. Although, she wasn't sure what's on the oyster list when we asked her about it."}
{"text":"This place definitely brought a new game to the world of seafood boils in the city. Still serving up some regular crab, shrimp, mussel boils - but also have a fresh oyster bar and other bar favourites like nachos, sliders and beer flights.

The venue is well designed, well lit and inviting.  First thing you see when entering is the oyster bar and it's pretty awesome. 

Had the lobster rolls, curry Dungeness crab, garlic butter mussels, seafood fried rice, and shrimp boils with Good Catch house blend sauce.  The Cajun fries were bomb, kinda remind me of Costco Fries. 

Overall flavours are there, but a touch on the salty side. They have some good selection of beer to wash it all down though.

Service was great and friendly.

Just saw they have soft shell crab sandwich.. will have to come back for that."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service and DELICIOUS food! The bagged seafood is so flavourful and a very generous portion. HIGHLY recommend the good catch blend, also great with veggies! Both the corn and brussel sprouts were a great add on! 

If you enjoy cooked seafood, the lobster roll is FANTASTIC! I got it hot with butter and it come with salad and fries. The fries are also SO GOOD :)

Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Good company, good atmosphere, and quite importantly, good food!

Came on a Wednesday night with some friends at 7:30 p.m. It was surprisingly quite empty given the amount of hype and attention that this restaurant has been getting. Two of my friends and I shared a pound of shrimp and the well-known Lobster Nachos. 

POUND OF SHRIMP w/ MEDIUM (Spice) CAJUN SAUCE

If you think that eating this will create a big mess, you are correct! But the restaurant provides you with not only a large bib, but also gloves. I personally enjoyed the experience of peeling my own shrimp and getting right into the food! The shrimp were wonderfully warm and well-seasoned; though, I found the sauce to be too spicy (on the other hand, my friends said that they didn't taste any spice whatsoever). 

*Quick Tip: Our waiter was kind enough to provide us with a sample of other sauces, so if you are unsure about how hot/what type of sauce you would like, you can try asking them for a sample

LOBSTER NACHOS

If you can picture the awesomeness of perfectly cooked lobster (not that rubbery, overcooked texture) with the amazingness of crispy nachos drenched in cheese with three types of dips (sour cream, guacamole, and salsa), then you've got an accurate idea of what the Lobster Nachos are. These were AMAZING! There is no need to dig into the head/tail for meat (they are only there for decorative purposes). This can certainly be shared among 3 people, with enough lobster to go around to each person. I would say if you decide to visit Good Catch Boil House, this is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Great new place to eat in Markham.

The place is interesting because they're not only a seafood boil restaurant but also sports bar. There are big screens everywhere, constantly showing sport channels.

Their food are great. The price is in line with what other seafood boil restaurants charge, but I think that they're better seasoned than the others.

Their staff are super friendly and the place is not cramped, making eating experience more relaxed. They have giant Popeye statue right where you walk in for some reason, good picture opportunity."}
{"text":"Went here with my family and was pleasantly surprised! We started with the lobster nachos, which were very tasty and were presented in a cool, different way. While they were good, I found it a bit expensive for what we were getting. 

For our mains, three of us got queen crab legs with their special catch seasoning (a mix of Cajun, garlic butter, and lemon pepper). The crab legs were extremely saucy (which we all loved) and the seasoning was fantastic. My mom got the lobster roll and enjoyed it, however said she'd had better. 

Overall it was a good atmosphere, and had great service. Food was very good, however some things on the menu were pricey. Will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Definitely lives up to the hype. Excellent selection of fresh seafood, and interesting seafood incorporated dishes. Interesting experience for those who are keen for seafood. Notably, the muscles are large in size, and as are the snow crab legs. I highly recommend the garlic butter flavour, especially if you like a strong garlic flavour. You can also opt to add a slight kick, choosing the mild garlic butter flavour. Beyond the very fresh seafood, the oyster sliders are also an excellent pick, with an abundance of fresh oysters that are lightly fried, topped with fried onions and their house mayo. The sweet potato fries are also a good an excellent side option, with a nice tangy mayo/Siracha dipping. Would definitely recommend this resturant for seafood lovers for a unique experience full of fresh and flavourful seafoos!"}
{"text":"A new competitor to the captain's boil scene, this place was ok. Would still prefer captain's boil from a flavour perspective. Basic bagged seafood with sauce concept but also lots of options for seafood and bar food entrees. 

We ordered 2 combos for 6 people plus the lobster mac and cheese and Cajun fries. It was plenty of food even without the mac and cheese. 

The bagged seafood was okay. There's lots of seasoning options for your seafood bags, we tried the good catch spices and the garlic butter. Neither were very good. And it seemed like there wasn't much butter or real butter wasn't used. There just wasn't that buttery fragrance or flavour you would find from captains boil. 

Also, do not order the Cajun fries. A tiny basket of thin cut fries that seemed lightly dusted with some unflavourful Cajun spices.. McCain has better fries than these.

Lastly, while they weren't  great in the food category, the service was actually really good. Incredibly attentive despite being really busy. The kitchen screwed up and we didn't get a lobster mac and cheese until very late, and upon cancelling the order, they brought it out and comped it on the house, a nice gesture to save whatever goodwill we had left. 

I feel they're trying to do too many things at once and quality and speed suffers. They're non-seafood-bag food and entrees look decent, but probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"At first try originally we didn't like this place due to the salad and smaller portions. But since we have given more chances and have been very happy with the outcome. 

They are fast and efficient in serving up your order quickly and especially with takeout. 

Now come here weekly for a seafood staple for dinner. 


Oysters, shrimp, clams are always amazingly fresh. I love that they put so much garlic chunks in the sauce as well. Mostly other places are cheap with that ingredient.

Definitly love this place over captains boil.  

I recommend this to anyone craving seafood and especially for the oysters !! Another notable item is their soft shell crab !"}
{"text":"I came here for a media event along with some other Yelpers, food bloggers and instagrammers. It was a fun event where they proved themselves to be a fantastic addition to the area.

Food:
Deep fried oyster sliders with onion strings - Crunchy, savoury, great bread... all around delicious.
Chicken wings - absolutely gigantic, good sauce. A great choice for non-seafoodies hanging with their pirate friends.
Gumbo soup - Excellent!
Slaw - crunchy, refreshing and tasty. A good start to the richness ahead.
Curry crab, not as good as Saigon Star, but still excellent with some actual kick!
Fried rice - Great seafood and Cajun flavour, with a bit of spiciness. It's an interesting take on a classic Chinese dish.

Everyone who works there seems to love it there and have a genuine excitement about the food. 

Ambiance is fun, a bit upscale (considering you're wearing bibs and gloves) with a ton of screens for sportos. It'd be a great place to hang out after work for a few beers (good selection on tap) and some snacks."}
{"text":"Nice decor.  Great service.  Food is good.  Better than other similar place cause they have more selection than just boil seafood, they have deep fried oyster sliders etc which are good for kids.  Will return!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere if this place reminds me of a bar with large tvs area - the food is pretty good. You order your seafood with accompanying vegetables if wanted and pick your spice and it comes in a plastic steamer bag. Sounds weird at first but they give you gloves and a bib. The best part is you can be as messy as possible.

My fav was the cherry clams with the good catch blend (spicy and garlicy) with okra.

Other yummy selections include: fried oysters, oyster sliders and the softshell crab sandwich. 

The pricing is reasonable for seafood and the service is pretty good. The only they could improve on is to check up more frequently to fill our glasses of water. When eating spicy and salty foods, water helps!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Good Catch for their lunch specials but I would highly recommend coming here for them! Although the prices are higher than what I would normally pay for lunch, the food is worth it. I got the salmon poke bowl and it's just a little more expensive than poke in downtown Toronto, but it takes super fresh and clean and you get to sit down in a nice restaurant to enjoy it. My friends got the avocado grilled cheese and the lobster mac and cheese and they both enjoyed it immensely! I had a taste of both of theirs as well and it was great. I would go back for dinner to try their seafood, but the lunch specials are great for celebrating a birthday or other occasions!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and decent food. I got the mussels one pound and shrimp as well as snow crab. The price was rather decent and portion wasn't too small. Definitely more of a place for big groups. The flavours I got for the seafood bags for butter garlic, mix and pepper lemon. All of them were decent but overpowered by the garlic one at the end. 

On the side I also got mussel burger fried which was fresh and not too oily. It was served like small tapas."}
{"text":"Nothin fishy about Good Catch!

Good Catch lured us in after months of trolling for their opening and Yelp baited us with a 10% discount for checking in. Service wasn't crabby, we cast a wide net with a flight of beer and enjoyed food fresh off the boat. We hooked into hot n buttery lobster roll with Cajun fries, salad and coleslaw...delicious! Next we tackled Szechwan shrimp with corn and Garlic butter snow crab legs. Szechwan sauce was wonderfully spicy for those tasty shrimp...a bit hot on the lips for the corn but it was sweet and juicy. 

We'll be back to this fishing hole!"}
{"text":"Food Quality: Acceptable ; sauces are all covering the taste of seafood. If you enjoy this way, yes go for it.

Service Quality: Excellent

Price: Overpriced - better quality of seafood you may get from other places at these prices 

Worth to try but considering other choices of seafood restaurants"}
{"text":"I recently discovered Good Catch Boil House on Yelp and decided to come here with a girlfriend for dinner since I've been meaning to try a seafood place like this. I must say I'm not at all disappointed and I will definitely come back.  They are located in the Downtown Markham area with a full parking lot which is very convenient.  We walked in and we were seating right away.  The restaurant is super spacious with TVs surrounding the restaurant.  They also had an open bar with bar stools and an area where you can see all the fresh oysters they offered.  I decided to start with the Flying Monkey beer and my girlfriend ordered an Iced Tea and the Beau Soleil oysters to share as a starter.  The oysters were fresh and delicious (no complaints here).  We were debating whether or not we wanted to share a combo or if we wanted to order individual portions.  In the end, we decided on ordering a combo - Shrimp and Clam with Corn and Potatoes.  For the flavour of choice, we decided to go with the Good Catch sauce (garlic butter with cayenne) and mild spice with an extra side of Vermicelli.  Once we ordered, we were given bibs and gloves.  The seafood came in a clear plastic bag and all the food was inside the plastic bag.  Surprisingly, there was a lot more seafood than expected.  The shrimps were delicious and meaty and the clams were so flavourful and fresh.  The Good Catch sauce was finger lickin' good.. the best combination of flavours!  The only thing I would say is that they should offer more corn as we only had 2 pieces in our bag.  The overall experience and customer service was good.  The girl who served us came by numerous times to ask if we were doing okay.  I highly recommend Good Catch Boil House and I will definitely come back to revisit next time I'm looking for a Good Catch. ;)"}
{"text":"granted the food was good. 
SERVICE WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I fell walking in on a rainy day, there was no Caution wet floor sign, no carpet. the hostess didn't even look back to see if we were following them. one of the other diners helped me up. 

I then had to ask three times for the waitresses or somebody to put up a sign. there was no comp for my bill whatsoever which I wasn't asking for it. there was no acknowledgment of \"are you okay\" and most of all there was a lady about by my estimate, 70 years old who if she had followed me might have fallen. the second time I asked that waitress or hostess to put up a sign, she rolled her eyes at me. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. If my injuries bother me some more I intend to sue, it is absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great boil! Had the curry crab and one of the best tasting I ever hard. Will highly recommend"}
{"text":"Not only are they a Boil house (seafood in a bag shindig) but they are also a sports bar that I frequent on game day and when I want to go somewhere more low-key. I mean everyone loves eating lobster in a bag with your hands with a cold one to go with it right? 

Impressive selection of craft beer if that's what you're into. Liquor ranges from your basic bar rail to top-shelf cognacs and whiskeys such as macallan rare cask. As long as they have what's needed they can make a huge variety of cocktails, just ask! 

Bar food is in full affect with a seafood twist to it, from chicken wings and nachos to fried oyster sliders (MUST ORDER). they even have happy hour specials after 9PM (who's getting plastered before 9 anyways) with $5 drinks and $8 double bar rails! Select food items are discounted as well which is also another plus. 

Huge restaurant, but consider making a reso on the weekend or when the playoffs are on considering its hit or miss if they'll be slammed or not. Service is super attentive even when theyre busy they usually have enough staff to make sure all the tables are taken cared of, management also make their rounds as well which is nice to see, super friendly as they make conversation with customers thus building a solid base of repeat customers.

Obviously the most important thing is the food, I've tried most of the menu and I do believe they have something for everyone whenever you like seafood or not their non-seafood dishes are equally as good. I'm not a huge fan of oysters but they have a pretty wide selection of oysters too. If you have difficulty deciding on which oysters you prefer the staff are pretty knowledgeable on the different ones available. 

My Go-To's: 
Fried Oyster Basket 
Oyster Sliders
Soft Shell Crab Fried Rice 
Mussels/Shrimp in Good Catch Blend 
Clams in Garlic Butter 
Lobster Roll (Cold) 

Like I said they have something for everyone so my list may or may not carter to your tastebuds. 

Parking is no problem just park in the lot just across the street on the east side of the restaurant if there isn't anything available in the underground."}
{"text":"I love this establishment. I recently got to try their lunch menu and needless to say, this place is still great. 

We enjoyed the mac n cheese and the lobster grilled cheese with cajun fries. Both dishes was cheesy and yummy!

We also tried the salmon and tuna poke bowl. Both bowls were beautifully presented but the overall taste was just OK - lacking flavour. 

The portions are small for the price you pay so I wouldn't say it's a daily lunch place. Service was good."}
{"text":"This is probably better then any captain boil in GTA. The mussels and shrimp combo for $25 comes with potato and corn and is delicious. I got mine with Cajun flavour which had really good flavour and had a bit of a kick if you get it medium spice. 
The seafood was fresh and some of the mussels were the size of my palm. 
Definitely give this place a try if you're a seafood lover."}
{"text":"Came here serval times for lunch and dinner. Their dinner menu is petty darn good! The lunch menus is kinda meh, I mean it's not bad, but nothing crazy. I had their lobster roll, which was good! But maybe because I have such high standard with lobster roll (since I had them at boston) I wasn't really wowed by their lobster roll. And their price is kinda high! 

I love how the seafood came out in bags because it's very different, although... my other side of me saying not sure how \"safe\" that is....... boiling food in a plastic bag......... hmmm anyway something for all of you to think about. 

I had their lobster nachos, which was ok..... but they did put a lot of lobster in it which was a bonus! 

The service was very nice and quick, the food came out quick! I would def come back here another time to try other food on their menu!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here relatively frequent since the establishment opened and I got to say; they have never once have me leaving dissatisfied.

Food: What to expect from GoodCatch is a variety of seafood catch, sous-vide with a selection of flavours offered. I would say if it is your first time coming here, I would highly recommend going for this option. 

Otherwise, GoodCatch offers the best Lobster roll around the Toronto-York Region area. Of which, in my opinion, has yet to have been beat in comparison. Some of their deep-fried alternatives such as their Shrimp Basket has been well worth my money with the decent portions provided.

Lets not forget the wide variety of craft beers on tap. Additionally, GoodCatch offers beer flights which will allow you to sample 4 beers at a reasonable price. Not a lot of places offer such option and I wholeheartedly welcome it.

Service: Staff is friendly and welcoming. Although I have to say attentiveness is what suffers in this case. I'm not the type that wants the regular attention of the server. Quite the contrary, however, it could sometimes be difficult to wave down a server even while service is on a down time. Other then that, the wait staff have been great.

Atmosphere: It's a sports bar, it will be loud and that's what I expect it to be like. I prefer quiet places where I can hold a conversation, but when I'm in a sports bar I expect it to be loud and upbeat. For that, big points for creating a vibrant atmosphere.

Recommended? Yes! Absolutely."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Like others have commented, the boil sauce is on the salty side.   Ordered the lobster nachos, not a lot of lobster and probably not worth $29.  On the other hand the soft shell crab was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The Good Catch Slaw was a beautiful mountain of fresh and healthy ingredients that you could then mix together with the provided raspberry sauce to enjoy an appetizing salad to start off the meal.  It was really good and I liked it.  I especially liked the sweet figs in this slaw."}
{"text":"I've been here about at least 6 times now. It's a perfect spot to catch the game, or a casual night out with friends for seafood or drinks. There are a decent amount of TV's available, and the waitresses are always very friendly.

I always get a pound of mussels along with another food item. If you are not sure about which sauce to get, the good catch sauce has a bit of everything. If you want to get full then I highly recommend adding potatoes and corn to your order because it is pretty good value.

I also went for lunch today and got try the lobster grilled cheese. It wasn't as big or as hearty as in the pictures on the menu, but it was still pretty good. There were some decent chunks of lobster in it, and the cheese was rich but not overwhelming. The whole sandwich is lightly grilled for just a bit of crispness.

I am not a big beer drinker, but they always have a decent selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Checked this place out during their soft opening, and have consistently been going to Good Catch when craving to get down and dirty in some seafood. Food quality and taste have been consistent every time I visit, and the staff are friendly and quick with your orders. Sadly, they've recently raised their prices, which is not surprising given how busy they are day to day. Some of the food seem a bit too pricey for what you get, but here were some of the things I tried:

Shrimp/Mussels/Clams with Good Catch Blend: The seafood comes in a bag and you order by lb. The seafood itself is pretty big compared to other seafood bars, and the sauce is has a lot of garlic and a good amount of kick, depending on how spicy you want it. 

Chicken Wings with Buffalo/Honey Garlic: As weird as it is to get chicken wings at a seafood bar, their chicken wings are actually one of the highlights at this place in my opinion. The breading is nice and crisp, and the wings are huge. Comes with some Cajun fries that taste kind of like Costco fries with a kick of spice, so what's not to like?

Oyster sliders: Very flavorful, and the oysters are packed in between the buns.

Fried Rice: If you like the Good Catch blend sauce, it will taste just like that, but in the fried rice.

Poke Bowl - Spicy Salmon: Flavours are there and it tastes pretty good. A bit too much rice in the topping:rice ratio.

Lobster roll: Delicious, but portion's small for the price.

Overall, I will continue to visit."}
{"text":"Good Catch is my first choice when it comes to boiled seafood places.  I love how their menu has lots of other choices in addition to the boiled seafood.  From my last few visits (4 times in 2 months), I tried pretty much most of the items on the menu and I like most of them or there wasn't anything I didn't enjoy.  My favourite combo is clam in the house blend sauce with okra and brussels spouts.  Definitely will come back and recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there with my wife for lunch the first time, very quiet. I had salmon & beef poke bowl, just so so & nothing surprising I have to say. The brown rice came with the beef was cold from fridge, disappointing. Rice should be in room temperature like in sushi, as rice when cold has a total different texture & not supposed to be served. The final bill was $29.35 and I gave a $50 bill, what I got back was 4 $5 bill & some spare coins. So they expected me to pay a $5 bill i.e.20% tips for a $26 lunch or just leave the coins? ( Service is okay but not that great, I barely touched my bowl and the waitress didn't even bother to ask why)"}
{"text":"Delicious seafood, their flavours are very good. My favourites - garlic butter and cajun. Because the flavours are strong, you may want to order some sides to go with it. We also tried their raw oysters, they were great and tasted fresh. Overall, I enjoyed this place. It gets messy so don't wear white!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this review is getting a 3/5 because I'm no longer a seafood fan the way I used to be. I could be biased.

I remember ordering the food and the server brought our salads out first. They didn't ask if the bacon on the salad was okay (it just said Cesar Salad on the menu). We had to send it back.

Then I asked for a straw for my water and the server totally forgot. We had to ask again and our straw finally came after a while.

I got the muscles with the Good Catch Blend: Great sauce and the muscles were a good portion if you're not interested in working for your food like you'd have to for the Crab Legs and especially the Lobster.

I also ordered the Hot Lobster Roll. I've had better lobster roles and this was was kind of cold. Not a fan. I feel like rolls need to be warm atleast."}
{"text":"Spacious, fun, unique and well-lit decor.  Great for chilling and entertainment at the bar and not just to dine as restaurant.  They play vibrant and cool music along with large and awesome TVs to watch.  The service is terrific and place is well-staffed.   Delicious variety of food with wonderful presentation and incredible array of distinctive drinks.   My only preference would be to automatically offer cutlery aside from the gloves required to eat some of the seafood dishes.  Definitely an exceptional place to go with family/friends or just to hang-out.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"5 stars for service, 3 stars for the food.

Arrived last night for a Friday girl's night out. The place was pretty packed but we were seated around 15-20 minutes later, which wasn't as long of a wait as I thought. Service was friendly and attentive and our waitress came back often to refill our glasses, which was much appreciated!

In terms of food we opted for the soft shell crab sandwiches as well as a tray of oyster sliders to share. The crab is smaller than what's pictured in the menu, but with cajun fries and caesar salad accompanying the dish at least we won't be leaving hungry. The batter was too thick for my liking which covered the flavour of the crab, but I loved the mango salad that was on top of it! 

The oysters in the sliders were tasty but again, too much batter. The oyster itself is very good- tasted fresh and sweet, but unfortunately was overpowered by the amount of fried batter put on it as well as being topped by more fried onions. I think next time I'd opt out of the fried onions for the sliders or ask if there's any alternatives to their condiments but otherwise it was enjoyable. Both sliders and sandwiches were put on cold buns which I found a bit strange - definitely would have enjoyed it if it was toasted at least. 

I would give this place another try to see what the boiled options are as that seems to be the main attraction of this place."}
{"text":"Favourite boil seafood restaurant in gta! I've tried two other places but nothing compares to here, great staff and delicious flavours! They also have large TVs around the restaurant for those sport nights and a large selection of craft beers on tap!  

Among all their flavours the garlic butter has got to be my all time favourite. Their lobster roll is amazing too, pricey but sooo good, can't get enough of it and don't even get me started with their oysters. Great oyster selection! Their oysters sliders was also amazing, very unique. 

Always a pleasure coming here 
Side note: unlike other boil seafood restaurants, they use napkins instead of paper towel rolls, much more convenient!!"}
{"text":"Located in the same plaza as the Markham Cineplex VIP, makes it a great and accessible location at the heart of Downtown Markham. Came here twice, once for lunch and a second time for dinner. I personally prefer their lunch menu items more than their dinner options as most of the dinner items are mostly deep fried or very strongly flavoured versus lighter options on the lunch menu. The restaurant itself has a comfortable layout with seating options great for small and large parties. There is a large screen on one end of the restaurant which turns the place into a sports bar when a game is on. The atmosphere immediately changes once people start cheering and it can get quite exciting and noisy. 

During my lunch visit, my friend and I had shared a Salmon Poké Bowl with sushi rice and the Lobster Grilled Cheese with Fries. The poké bowl wasn't just raw fish and rice, but a mixture of many other ingredients like edamame, cucumber, jalapeno, crab meat, seaweed salad, salmon roe sesame, seaweed, shallots, tangerine, corn and spicy mayo. All these ingredients went very well with the rice and wasn't very heavy surprisingly. As for the grilled cheese, the cajun fries were very crisp and fried just the way I like them while the sandwich was a little messy to eat, but there was definitely lobster meat in it. 

On a separate day for dinner, I had ordered the Fish and Chips while my friend ordered the Fried Oyster Basket. The fish wasn't overcooked but was a bit oily, but again the cajun fries were bomb, nice and crispy. The soft shell crab basket is on my list of things to try on my next visit here. With the restaurant being so close to the cinema, it'll definitely be an option I'd consider right before or after a movie."}
{"text":"I came with a small group  on a Wednesday night and it was pretty packed for such a large area restaurant. It's funny how many people rather wait than to be seated on the high tables. Anyways, we wanted to see what the hype is all about. 

We only ordered the bagged seafoods and half a dozen of fundy bay oysters that night. I must say the seafood were pretty fresh, clean, and tasty. However, I wasn't too impressed with their sauces. Of course, the best was their special in house sauce. However, the garlic butter, lemon pepper, and cajun definitely has room for improvement. The garlic butter tasted very buttery and watery at the same time and barely any garlic. It tasted very weak. As for the lemon pepper, it was very salty. The cajun was just okay, nothing exciting. Therefore, for the bagged seafood, I might just head back to their rivalry, Captain Boil. 

Overall, service was alright and I would come back to try the other seafood dishes that they offer instead (such as their slaw, poke bowls, fried oyster sliders, lobster nachos, etc.)."}
{"text":"So we came here tonight to celebrate my son's 11th birthday. We came at around 7. 45pm and the place is fairly quiet. Only around 5/6 tables occupied. We were given menus and took a while to decide what to order.
We finally ordered 1lb of mussels in Good Catch Sauce plus corn, 1lb of shrimp in Garlic Butter, 12 Honey Garlic Wings, Oyster Sliders, Hot Lobster roll and 6 Raspberry Point Oysters. The boil in the bag seafoods were ok, it's the first time I've tried it and I doubt I'd ever order it again. I enjoy seafood but cooked in a different way. The lobster roll was ok, the meat was a bit overdone and rubbery. The oyster sliders are nice and worthy of ordering. The highlight was probably the chicken wings, they're quite large and cooked well but the meat remains moist. Then we get to the raw oysters, they didn't arrive. So we're all finished and I enquire about our missing oysters. The waitress says she'd go check and comes back saying there was a mix up and they'll arrive in 5 minutes. How can you mixup orders taken on an IPad? So I was expecting a discount on these oysters, but they were just charged at full price. Any restaurant would discount missing items because I could have just cancelled the order. They were supposed to have been served first and not last. Not a big deal but it makes me hesitant to ever return and this place isn't busy on weekdays. Water wasn't refilled either until asked. 
Food here is ok but service isn't that great or adequate."}
{"text":"Visited again with my family since my mother liked the seafood here. It's a lot busier than when we first came.

This time, we ordered 4lbs of mussels (garlic butter, good catch blend, Cajun), 2lb shrimp (garlic butter, good catch blend), 2lb clams (garlic butter, good catch blend), fried oysters, and some fries. 

Perhaps they were more busy this time, but they didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our food. I probably should've spoke up during the second round since my mother commented that it wasn't the same as last time. 

The sauces were tasty, but not spicy. Way too much sodium like how I remembered. They could take it down 2 notches and it'd be perfect. 

Shrimp was annoying to eat. Nothing special, but decent. 

Clams were surprisingly yummy. But definitely way more shell than meat. 

Mussels were the crowd fave - they were big, succulent mussels! Much bigger than I remember. Just thinking back to it makes me salivate a little. 

Would still come back, mostly for mussels. My mother still likes this place even though I failed to order the right sauce for her - she loves her spice! 3.5/5"}
{"text":"We came back again on Thursday. I took my Ottawa friends here and they liked the clams too. The garlic clams still taste amazing as always. I can eat two bags or more by myself. The shrimp is not as good. So I rather save my quota for the clams. The Shenzhen sauce was way too over powering and spicy.

I like the ambiance and lighting at this restaurant too. I will be back for more garlic clams and the Waterloo radler!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I got food poison from the seafood here. The oysters were yummy but the soft shell crab was a major disappointment. The crab was tiny and smothered in greasy batter, to the point that you can't taste the crab."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good but very busy, so service wasn't as attentive. The food was overall good but portions are on the small side. We got the shrimp with garlic bread and good catch blend which I thought was very good (very salty tho) and clams in the lemon pepper sauce ( good but tasted more like curry?) I particularly enjoyed the soft shell crab fried rice - they really loaded it with soft shell crab! We also had some of the raw oysters which were fresh but kinda small."}
{"text":"So tasty, its definitely finger-licking yums! I came here for dinner but ended up going pretty late to meet some friends. Service and quick and food was delicious. Just the right amount of spice to pack in all that flavor. The lobster roll, Lobster nachos and cheese and the good-catch blend for the shaken seafood was to die for. I left feeling extremely satisfied.  I even poured the sauce onto my french fries. LOL. 

Ambiance is great, I love the popeyes statue in the front to welcome you. The set up works well for large groups of friends and family. Safe for kids and that added touch of a sink they put out in the open was a great idea for people to be able to wash their hands after making a large mess on the table. Great Job! The attire of the staff was excellent, very lux touches with the leather chained aprons and the coordinated v-neck shirts for the female staff. 

Will I come again? yes yes yes. More seafood for my belly. I need to try the other dishes ... my suggestion is come with a minimum party of 4 otherwise you wont be able to finish everything as the dishes are pretty large. More like shareable dishes. And if you want to enjoy that lobster nachos and cheese platter, its huge! Just warning you.  Go with 4 people or more to get a better variety of orders."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a big group for lunch. we had made a reservation ahead of time but even when we got there it was not packed. Granted it was Thursday afternoon. I have been to other boil houses like Captain's boil before so I was familiar with the concept of eating out of a plastic bag with gloves on LOL. 

What set this place apart from all those other places is the variety in their menu. They don't just have plastic bags of seafood, but they have plenty of party appetizers, poke bowls, sandwiches, and other stuff. Which is really nice to see especially when going with a big group. 

We ordered two lobster nachos to share, oyster sliders, shrimp in the bag, and the soft shell crab sandwich. I can't tell you which one was the best they were all so flavourful in their own way. The lobster nachos came with a shell of the lobster, the meat was taken out already and placed throughout but the pic for the gram was on point. LOL. The oyster sliders and soft shell crab are definitely a must try when going there! I've never had soft shell crab but after this I will definitely be going back for more. The shrimp in the bag was more flavourful than Captain's boil in my opinion-I got the house blend flavor. 

The decor is also something else. You can tell it was very well put together and thought out. During my visit, we saw two lobsters fighting which was fun LOL

It is a bit on the pricier side but the portion and quality match the price point."}
{"text":"Went out on a Tuesday night, it was fairly quiet with only a few customers. Was initially seated near the kitchen while the whole dining room was empty so I asked the staff to move tables. Once seated we ordered the calamari and lobster rolls. 
The calamari was EXTREMELY dry and I was very disappointed. The lobster roll is overly priced for such a small sandwich, and the Cesar salad it came with did not have any dressing...the only good part about the plate was the Cajun fries. 
Would not recommend dining here, overly priced food and very low quality. Not to mention the same 5 songs from the early 2000s were played on loop"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with husband and ordered 2lbs of shrimp .. as we've always been here and ordering the same stuff, the portion of the sauce has been significantly less than before. Then i realized that they now charge $2 for extra sauce. Apparently they have intentionally reduced the portion of sauce and make customers pay extra $2 to get full flavor. This sounds to me is such a cheap business strategy. You are being stingy on giving enough sauce and make customers pay extra. Where the sauce doesnt really cost a penny. To me this is a deal breaker, it's not that I cant afford the extra 2 dollars, but using such a trick to fool customers. Disappointed!
So the food without enough sauce just tasted like boiled shrimp and corn.... tasted so dry and then i had to keep drinking coke... just found out that this was the first time that I could even finish my coke... maybe they switched to smaller glasses as well.. so cheap and dont think i'd ever come back.."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my friend on a Sunday and it was surprisingly quiet. We were seated immediately. 

We both ordered the salmon poke bowl off the lunch menu, with spicy mayo and brown rice. The presentation was outstanding and it was by far the prettiest poke bowl I've ever had. In terms of taste, I found that there was a little too much rice compared to all the other toppings, but it was pretty good overall. The portion size was huge and I was unable to finish, but the waitress packed it in a to-go container for me. 

I would definitely love to come back and try their other options, especially the lobster grilled cheese."}
{"text":"The people in my company was fabulous, the food was good, except the shrimp, it was not fresh and was mushy as soon as it entered the mouth. The reason for 2 stars is mainly the service. It was terrible. We asked for water and it took over 10 mins to arrive. We tried calling the waitress over many times but was ignored. I personally will not be returning. Captains boil or other boils are much better, go there instead."}
{"text":"First time in Canada for business trip and first restaurant visited.  Love the food and service! Tina was my waitress and she provided prompt and friendly service. Also appreciated her recommendations.  Had the lobster roll and fried oysters.  The lobster roll came with salad and fries.  It was quite tasty so would give it 5/5.  The fried oysters was good but a bit greasy so 4/5.  Perhaps I'm more used to having raw oysters.  lots of things to try on the menu so would definitely return when I'm back in Canada!"}
{"text":"Typical boil house food. Several items out of stock during dinner hour. Service was great in the beginning, but kind of trailed off in the end. I mean the server was friendly and energetic, but when you needed something it took a couple of tries to get their attention."}
{"text":"Came here a few minutes past lunchtime and didn't get to try their Poke bowls. I was a bit bummed because I wanted to try a poke bowl with zucchini noodles. Oh well. We'll have to come back. 

Moving on, we ordered from the dinner menu and got a little bit of everything from shrimp, to their soft shell crab, to their chicken wings. 

The shrimp was really good and the sauce was amazing too. I believe we got the mix of all the sauces. Can't remember what it's called. I'm personally not a fan of soft shell crab, but my husband enjoyed it. I felt that there was too much of the mushy stuff inside. The guts? Chicken wings were huge and the sauce was good too. I love that they serve their dishes with Cajun fries. I'm a sucker for those. I ordered some rice noodles and didn't know what to expect, but they came plain. That was perfectly fine though, because we had so much sauce from the shrimp to eat it with. 

Service was friendly and efficient. Can't wait to go back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great menu selection, nice decor, friendly service (although a bit thinly spread). Oyster sliders are a must-try as well as the happy hour apps. The quality is the most important sell here. The mussels are huge, oysters are fresh, and portions are good. Like this place even more than Captain's Boil. At the moment, they don't have birthday freebies though :("}
{"text":"What a catch! This budding city sure is lucky to attract the eyes of some fantastic seafood restaurant entrepreneurs. This Asian fusion seafood boil trend is really picking up and with all trends, there are winners and there are losers. Good Catch is, in my books, an absolute winner!

I don't expect a lot from these over-sauced, deep fried seafood joints but I kept getting surprised by the tastiness of everything! If you're gonna come, bring friends, leave your diet at home, and get ready to drink a lot of water! Between 12 of us, we got an assortment of: 

Shrimp Gumbo: Feels, looks, and tastes like a regular soup. Out of everything ordered, this was the one I liked the least, though it still tasted alright. I just expected gumbo to be thicker, like a shrimp stew. 

Mussels in House Sauce: Yes, that house sauce in a bag is salty as all hell but it's the epitome of garlicky goodness. Mussels are the perfect vessel with their meaty morsels and built-in scoop. 

Soft Shell Crab Sandwich: Finally!! A soft shell crab sandwich that is accessible to me! Previously, I traveled downtown to get a hold of one of these beauties and left disappointed. Good Catch, your soft shell did not need a hard sell. One bite and I was sold! 

Oyster Sliders: Fried oysters in 3 brioche sliders. I didn't know this was a thing...but it's now one of the most delicious things you can do with an oyster. Seriously, I'd go back just to order this by itself. 

Soft Shell Crab Fried Rice: Something on the more Asian end of Asian fusion. It's a pyramid of fried goodness with generous chunks of soft shell crab. 

My one suggestion would be adding bigger variety of non-fried seafood goods, like pastas, which they lack right now. I mean I love my deep fried sandwiches, but sometimes you want something a bit easier on the throat, especially with the salty salt bags of saucy seafood. 

Service was good, but not great. This might require just a bit more practice on the staff's part. Speaking of the staff, damn. That is one good looking crew. Located in the swanky \"Downtown Markham\" with a massive drink selection, great seating, and a sports bar vibe, the food wouldn't be the only thing you come back for! The Good Catch is definitely one of the best catches in this landlocked city.

(49/100) - 2017"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to seat and have a beer. The food is like Captain Broil plus little more. It's little pricey side but the food is pretty good. There is lot of different kind of beer also."}
{"text":"I was here last night - total 8 of us (6 adults and 2 kids). It was our first time and we have seen and heard some good things about this place. This restaurant is located outside of the theatre across from the employee/contractor parking lot. It was a Monday night (Game 1 of the Raptors/Cavalier playoffs) we arrive around 6pm. It wasn't very busy at that time just a few tables. this restaurant is very similar to Captain Boil if you have been there. The difference is this restaurant provides ceramic plates, utensils and glass cups compared to styrofoam bowls and plastic forks/spoons at Captain Boil. It's probably because they don't want to do any dishes and keep things as simple as possible. We don't like styrofoam nor plastic so I definitely have to give Good Catch props for this. They are both similar in which they provide a plastic bib and plastic gloves (although the bib at Good Catch is made with sronger plastic). The restaurant is spacious (rectangle tables), clean, lots of natural light and the hostess is friendly. Our server, Terry was very nice also. We ordered 2lb of shrimp (garlic butter flavour and Good Catch Blen medium spice). Both sauces were very good in their own way. We also got the lobster nacho. It was good to shared amongst the whole table - it had salsa on the side, avocado, cheese, olives, scallions and small pieces of lobster. The head and tail was included - my 8yr old said it was delicious. For the price of $29.95 we were expecting more pieces of lobster and bigger. All in all it wasn't bad. We also ordered 3 orders of the 12 piece wing and regular fries (it usually comes with cajun fries but my 4 year old can't eat spicy food). The wings were amazing.....fresh, hot and good size (all pieces were equal in portion). IT comes with two types of sauce - honey garlic (which tasted like plum sauce) or Buffalo (with a bit of kick). The Buffalo sauce tasted better so choose this one if you like some spice in your wings. The fries were fresh too and you can tell it wasn't fried in \"old\" oil. The other two dishes were chose were the two types of fried rice - Cajun seafood and Soft Shell Crab. Our favorite was the Cajun Seafood - the rice was more moist and there was more ingredients in the rice compared to the Soft Shell Crab. The rice was more dry and the flavor was more mild and not as flavorful. We really enjoyed our dinner and Terry didn't rush us out. She even re-filled our glasses with water and said we can sit as long as we wanted because she knew we were watching the game. We will definitely be back and try some other goodies - like their sliders and other seafood options like clams and mussels."}
{"text":"Lobster roll is to die for!!! You can have it hot with butter or cold with mayo.  But you should definitely try both.  The portion is small, but that is typical for a lobster roll.

Oyster Sliders are also good, but can feel quite heavy and greasy after you've eaten them.  

The Lobster Nachos are a really good deal because you get a lot of nachos and they do not skimp on the lobster either.  I, personally, am not a huge fan of nachos, so that's why it would not be a favourite of mine.  

And lastly, their signature 'catch,' which is their bags of marinated seafood.  Personally, I did not like their Good Catch Blend as much as I like Captain's Boil blend.  So I wouldn't normally order this on their menu.  

All in all, they prepare their seafood in lots of different ways; in burgers, in nachos, and I think they are trying to start selling poke as well.  This place is quite good."}
{"text":"Ahoy there matey! Are you hankering for some seafood? 

Cool decor with a GIGANTIC TV taking over one wall. Dining area is roomy and clean. We came to celebrate our anniversary with a meal (no freebie dessert) and movie. We arrived right before lunch finished and stayed till after Happy Hour started (3pm) so we were able to take advantage of both sets of specials SCORE! Our waitress was wonderful: cheerful, attentive and accommodating. 

ORDERED:
- Salmon Poke Bowl with edamame, cucumber, jalapeño, (immitation) crab meat, seaweed salad, Salmon roe (I thought they're bigger in size, see pic), shallot, tangerine and corn with spicy mayo dressing. Everything thing was fresh and delicious, a beautiful harmony of flavors but pricey for the portion.
- Fried Oyster Basket with Cajun fries - oysters were not fresh nor the batter crisp; but the fries were super crispy and nicely seasoned.
 - Latte made with Rufino coffee beans freshly ground on site. Decent coffee but the foam was too stiff.

The bad thing is there's no connection with the underground garage so you still have to brave the the cold to walk to the restaurant. 

RATING based on lunch specials and happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Checked out this place to see what the hype was about. Waited about 45 minutes on a weekend. I got the lobster roll with cajun fries and the caesar salad. The lobster roll was good but a bit small. Fries were cold and salad had way too much dressing. Good service, ok prices, but probably wouldn't come again since the food wasn't that special."}
{"text":"Interior is nicely decorated with a giant Popeyes at the front to greet you. Very spacious and welcoming restaurant. We came here for lunch and ordered the pokebowls and the lobster grilled cheese. In total lunch was around $70 for four people. The food is very instagram worthy, presentation is very well done. And the little details is why they can charge a premium for their food. Overall I had a pleasant experience. The food did take a while to arrive and eating within the one hour lunch time on a work day was hard. I will probably come back again to try their dinner and eat the seafood out of the bags which is what they are known for."}
{"text":"Location: This restaurant is situated in the busy Cineplex VIP Markham hot spot with access from outside and convenience of TONS of parking spots on the further side away from the theatre. During the Friday evenings and weekends, the parking lots may be more full ... but at least there is plenty of space to park above ground from this side of the plaza. 

Atmosphere: It has a similar feel to \"captain's boil\" where you can have some casual dining feel and fun dining experience due to all the messy scraps that you leave on the table and use of fingers to eat rather than utensils. The décor is nice in here... sort of like a \"Bar\" feel since there's TV monitors mounted on all the walls. It is also a big restaurant space with high ceilings, so it doesn't feel cramped and squished. Plentiful seating area for large or intimate groups. It was not too busy or hectic there when we came on a Friday evening. We made reservations, but the place wasn't packed, so didn't have to wait for our table. We did not feel rushed either since we sat there from 7-10:30pm and was not pushed to leave after we stopped ordering for awhile. 

Food: it has a similar but slightly larger menu option than Captain's boil. I ordered the Lobster nacho, slider burgers, pounds of clams and shrimps, okra, corn, Brussels sprouts, and beer flights. 

Lobster nacho - they were very generous with the amount of lobster meat they had!! We got a huge plate of nacho and tons of chunks of lobster meat was inside our dish. I didn't think it came out hot enough for the cheese to melt over it and didn't think it was a good combo b/c the nacho chips was all soggy and the flavours masked the lobster taste. 

Flavours of sauce for the pounds of seafood: THe Good catch sauce was a more mild taste than the popular captain's boil sauce. It has good flavours but dampened. This was quite delicious too because I didn't feel like I was overly thirsty after eating all those seafood and didn't feel like all the seafood flavours were masked by the sauce. 
Even the standard garlic and butter flavour was really delicious to go with the shrimp and clams. All the flavours we ordered didn't have any spice to it. I think the group of friends I went with prefer less spicy and if I had a choice next time, I'd probably ask for spicy flavour for their Good catch sauce (it shows a flame in the picture on the menu, but I really didn't get any spiciness from it)... STILL GOOD THOUGH!

FINAL: I would come here again because the service was really good. We had comfortable seating and never felt cramped or pushed for time. This is definitely a great place for a large group since it is definitely a much bigger restaurant than the Captain's boil locations."}
{"text":"Amazing food 
Amazing alcohol menu...owner recommended the Canuck and it was delishis...
Service was also amazing & she was very attentive to all our needs.

Amazing tv's to watch the raps beat the blazers!
Definitely going to be my go to place for sporting events...
So much more to go & try!
Until next time...definitely go try it"}
{"text":"This place is decent and I would give it a 3/5 based on what I had. 

Our group had reservations here for lunch . The restaurant wasn't busy so dropping in and  getting a table would not have been a issue. Restaurant was clean from what I can see; there were not sloppy mess from whoever sat at our table last. Service was pretty standard. 

Ordered the soft shell crab fried rice. The dish looked pretty good, piled high pyramid style. It's actually quite a lot of food. What I liked about this dish was being able to find many chunks of soft shell crabs so I do feel they gave you the entire thing. Soft shell crab was the highlight of the dish and it delivered. The rest (rice, mushroom, green and red peppers) was so-so. The rice was a bit hard. The green and red peppers were diced up, but too small and not enough to bring some much needed color to the dish. Overall flavor was ok. I don't think this is a good standalone dish, but would be better as an accompaniment to one of their seafood boil offerings. 

I have never agreed with restaurants charging mandatory gratuities, but just know that there is a mandatory service charge for large parties of 8 or more (which isn't even written on the menu). Surprise!!!"}
{"text":"Their good catch sauce is really good and the mussels are large so definitely worth the price. The lobster nachos were good but is it worth $30? Not rlly since there were just bits of lobster meat here and there. Everything else was decently priced for what you're getting. Will come back for their cajun seafood"}
{"text":"4.5, this place just opened recently, similar concept to captains boil / the boil in New York. It is very spacious, lots of tables. I came here on a Tuesday night and got a table right away. I tried the oyster sliders (which were delish) along with a pound of shrimp, clams and snow crab. There are other items on the menu such as lobster, crab, king crab and crawfish(difficult to eat and very little meat). You can then choose from a variety of spices (lemon pepper, Cajun, garlic butter, captains boil blend, curry etc.) The most popular would be the captains boil blend (mix of lemon pepper, Cajun and garlic butter) which I liked the most. The claims I tried with the garlic butter and it was awesome. The amount we ordered was good for 2 people. If you have more than 2 you may want to consider getting an extra pound or two. There was also choices on the side to add corn, sausage, potatoes etc to the mix which provided more variety when eating. The staff are very polite and the wait time for food is fairly quick. I would definitely be back to try their other items on the menu ie. lobster nachos, lobster rolls and fish and chips."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Decor was done very nicely. I looked at the menu and wanted to order everything. We tried oyster sliders, slaw, Raw oysters, crab, mussels, clams and shrimp. All great choices. Much better than captains boil where I feel rushed and food doesn't seem to taste as good. They also have a nice selection of craft beer. Will be back to try lobster nachos and soft shell crab sandwich!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday, and I actually really enjoyed it. Many people might compared this place with Captain's Boil, cause they are really similar restaurants, but there's only one Good Catch Boil House, while there's several franchises of Captain's Boil as this point. The idea actually seems like they copied Captain's Boil's concept and just tweaked it to make a restaurant of their own. The decor of this place IS really nice though, and they certainly have a unique style and add a nice touch to DownTown Markham.

We ordered the clams, $13.95 per pound, and you can choose between Cajun, Szechuan, Curry, Garlic Butter, Good Catch Blend and Lemon Pepper. Of course, if you know me well enough, my go to flavour is PROBABLY the garlic butter, and it was a well selected choice! The garlic didn't taste gross, but rather adds on to the delicious clams. In addition, we got the soft shelled crab fried rice, $13.95. This came in a giant pyramid, and was slightly spicy, so just ask the staff member if they can possibly make it less spicy for you if you're not a spice eater. This was also decent priced and large.

Next we got the oyster sliders, one of my favourite dish. The oysters were fried and reasonable priced $13.95. Lastly, we ordered their soft-shelled crab basket $10.95, which came with one whole soft shelled crab with a little bit of fries. 

Absolutely delicious meal, and the price of the meal was considered cheap as well."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times and keep going back. 

Happy with the oyster selection. 

Craft beer selection is also great and fun to do flights to sample a few. 

Lots of fried stuff - so plan on a heavy meal. Big slaw is a good option. Great for sharing at the table. Lobster nachos are totally worth it!  

Have done shrimp a couple of times. Trick is getting them out of the bag quickly so they don't over cook. Just dump them on the table if you have to. House seasoning is our go to. Love it. 

Place is now packed as soon as it opens. Plan to sit at the bar, line up or make a reso!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the lobster roll, get it hot with butter!  
Fries were great as well.  As for seafood in a bag, similar to other boil restaurants."}
{"text":"Anything other than the boiled items is good. Had boiled shrimp at the time and went home with severe food poisoning. 

Honestly, I really enjoyed the lobster roll prior to the shrimp poisoning. 10/10 recommend that."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for a weekday lunch. It was not too busy and we were seated right away. 

The atmosphere is nice and spacious, lcd tv's on the walls so you could catch a game. 

We ordered to share 1 pound of shrimp, garlic butter, no spice. It was really fresh and hot. The plastic bibs and plastic gloves makes it less messy, the sauce was sooo good!! Very flavourful! 

Also got a salmon poke with spicy mayo. There were so many level of flavours because of the number of toppings. Everything married well with each other, including the Mandarin oranges. Good price for serving size. We got sushi rice. 

Lastly we got Cajun fries. Nicely seasoned, crispy and hot. Pretty good portion. 

The seafood was really good here, can't wait to try dinner."}
{"text":"I came here tonight and had the cold lobster roll with Cajun fries!! I loved the fries and the Caesar salad, I'm not really into cold dishes so it was only alright for me. I wish I ordered the hot one. I loved the portions, the price was fair ($22.95). Its really cute inside. Chill vibes. I'd probably only come here once though."}
{"text":"I got lied to. They said the fish and chips was fresh and it didn't taste like it. I called a few days later and asked the manager. He said it was frozen fish. Kinda sad for a GOOD catch seafood resto."}
{"text":"So pleasantly surprised by coming here! Just happened to find this place from Googling what's around the area and by the pictures, the food looked amazing. No disappointment; the food not only looks great, but taste delicious too.

Pretty empty for lunch on a weekday, no wait, and the space is quite large. The walls and furniture are all decorated with boat theme, you are greeted with a giant popeye's sculpture, chalk work, lifesavers, blue benches, yellow chairs and yellow paint in the washrooms to match. Cohesive ambiance.

Shared the oyster slider with my friends, and the oyster was so soft and crispy on the outside. The bun was soft, barely toasted, and the mayo ozzing out, but my favourite part is the thin crispy onion rings-- yum. 

I got the veggie poke bowl, and let me tell you, this is one of the most visually stunning dishes I have ever seen. I love the fresh flower garnish. There was corn, edaname, diced cucumber, tofu skin, small tangerine slices, avocado, micro greens and seaweed on a bed of brown rice, topped with crispy taro spirals and buttermilk dill sauce.

Now, taste wise, there was a nice balance of texture and flavour. Crunchiness and salt from the taro and seaweed, sweetness from the tofu skin and tangerine, creaminess from the avocado and sauce. My favourite was the crispy taro spirals.

The fried wings with cajun fries was another stellar dish. The presentation looked so appetizing; the colour of the glaze on the wing was mouthwatering. Maybe because the place has glass walls so you get a lot of natural light, but every picture you take looks incredible.

I must mention, from a girl who doesn't like wings, I ate the whole thing-- it was SO GOOD. The sauce has some sweet honey taste and this delicious pepper taste and the meat is not fatty, it's very tender and lean. The fries were also good; thin and small like hickory sticks and crunchy. Not salty and greasy like pub food. I left very full.

Awesome place to eat with friends. I recommend the poke bowls and wings. I haven't tried their lobster, but I bet their seafood would be a good try!"}
{"text":"Good ambiance inside the restaurant, the tables come with a sheet of paper and a garbage bucket on the side of the table for you seafood lovers ! If you order any of the boils the server will give you bibs and plastic globesOrdered the hot lobster roll, fish sliders, and mussels. The hot lobster roll was delicious made with hot butter and it came with Cajun fries (thin and crunchy) and Caesar salad. The lobster roll is 22.95 but the portion wasn't that enough to share. I got the mussels in good catch sauce and I asked for it to be mild."}
{"text":"Just went here today(April 28 2017) after work with my boyfriend. We ordered oysters and lobster roll. And when we ordered we show the waitress the 10%off coupon which they offer on Yalp. The waitress agreed to honour the deal. After they brought the stuff we ordered, they did not bring the ketchup and the napkins. We wait more then five minutes to get both. We were not happy but fine cause we understand it's Friday night(busy night).

However, when we wanted to get the bill. The waitress brought us the bill without 10% off. We reminded her about it. Then she went to ask the manger, the response she brought back was the coupon is no longer valid, the manager has already moved the coupon. We were surprised. Then the waitress said just check on your phone to see the coupon is still there or no. I checked my phone. And it showed the coupon is still valid. So I showed it to her, the waitress said I need to show this to my manager. Then she just took my phone and walked away without asking my permission. What kinda of attitude and behaviour is that? She forced me to be like a police chasing a thief. I had to chase her in the restaurant to get my phone back on my hand! And I even told the manager about it, the waitress just try to be naive and said I thought you said I can take your phone. 

What a worse dinner ever! Even though the manager agreed to give us 10% off. We feel really disappointed about this place. 

I mean I do not really care about that 10% off coupon but if it shows it's valid then you should take it. Instead of have those dramas! If you as a manger forget to take the offer down then you have no excuse! It's your responsibility to check it not me! You are in the food service industry, those type of service and the way you train your staff is not really professional at all! We will never go here again!!"}
{"text":"The food was mostly good, but service could have been much better. We were the first ones in for lunch today and at the very start, service was fine. However, when more people started coming in for lunch, service lagged quite a bit.

We had the tuna poke bowl with zoodles (zucchini noodles) and the oyster sliders. We got the tuna with the recommended mandarin orange kiwi dressing. It was the most sophisticated looking poke bowl I've ever had, but in execution, it could have done better. For the price, I'd give it maybe a 2.5. Perhaps it was because of the zoodles, but it came off more like a salad than a lunch entree. It was refreshing, in a bland sort of way. The dressing was noticeable, but could have been stronger, especially if poke is supposed to be a pre-marinated affair. It was all a tad watered down. There isn't much tuna, given that this is a $12.99 bowl. All in all, I'd pass on this next time. However, those oyster sliders were incredible! There are two oysters per slider. They're fresh and hot and absolutely delicious. The bun is soft and fluffy and the fried onions tie everything together. I'd get those again in a heartbeat. 

I mentioned that service is slow. The restaurant was somewhere between a third and a half full, with three waitresses, and somehow, when I tried to get the bill, I still had to switch my raised hand three times because my arm was getting tired. Then, either the waitress who was to get our bill took a very long time, or she forgot about us, because I had to flag down a second waitress to get my bill, and that took a while as well, although not as long as the first time.

I'm still curious to see what else Good Catch has on the menu, I really hope the service improves.

Oh. One more thing. The restaurant smells like a fish market."}
{"text":"We decided to try Good Catch Boil House after a few friends went and recommended it. It was the first \"boil\" that we've been to. After thinking long and hard about all the plastic that would be used, we went. My hubby said that the plastic bags used are biodegradable but are they just the type that break up into a million tiny plastic pieces? Or are they compostable or made of corn and are truly eco-friendly?  I forgot to ask. 

Other than being bothered by the amount of plastic used (bibs, gloves, bags) the quality of the seafood was quite good. We tried the Good Catch seasoning and it was very tasty especially if you like a bit of spice (Cajun) and loads of garlic!  We had the clams and snow crab legs in that flavour. The shrimp was garlic butter flavoured which was also very yummy!  I ended up dipping the shrimp into the Good Catch sauce. 

If you want to avoid plastic, the fish and chips is a good alternative. It is served in a basket with a piece of paper as a liner. The Cajun fries were pretty good. The two generously sized fish pieces were nicely battered (light and crispy).  If we do return, I'll avoid the bags by ordering this.

For sides, we found the Brussels sprouts to be slightly undercooked and over priced. Corn was ok, perhaps not in season as they had no sweetness. Also $1 for a quarter of a cob wasn't quite worth it either but we need our veggies. Thankfully there was the seasoning to make up for that. 

All-in-all we liked the flavour but questioned if bags are necessary when the food could be seasoned by other means and placed on plates?  I'm sure it wouldn't affect the flavour. I understand that's all the craze now having seafood in bags but what's the environmental impact??  Not sure if we will go back because of this."}
{"text":"When my friends suggested dinner here, I may have groaned a little in my head. How can \"boiled in a bag\" seafood be good?

Wow was I wrong . 6 of us arrived for an early dinner on a Saturday (with reservations) and every item brought to the table was delicious!

We ordered the lobster nachos (YUM), oyster sliders (tasty and filling), fried shrimp (loved the Cajun fries), a dozen fanny bay oysters (which I don't normally enjoy, but these were so fresh and smooth!) clams with Brussel sprouts,... And everyone's ultimate favourite, the snow crab with the most amazing garlic butter sauce. It was so good I regret not packing the rest of my sauce home to drown every piece of food in my house in it. It just made everything so tasty. 

The restaurant got very busy by the time we left. 
Service wasn't bad (the food made up for being neglected for the first 20 mins ), and once my heart starts ticking again from my cholesterol overdose, we will be heading back again for more!"}
{"text":"A new boil bar concept restaurant is open at the Markham VIP cinema/Enterprise entertainment area. We came here for lunch during their soft opening.
 
First impressions were positive. The space is bright and airy and open in concept. I love the little details they've included like yellow shipping container napkin dispensers, and sunny yellow chairs that brighten up the otherwise contemporary wood detailed space. There is a good amount of space and ventilation to minimize the \"leaving the restaurant smelling like what you ate\" effect. Even the wait staff outfits with canvas and leather detailed aprons, the giant Popeye statue that you can't miss when you walk in (and are tempted not to take a selfie with), the eye catching branding, and the expansive bar with 18 taps for craft beer have all been thoughtfully considered. 

Now for the food. This place is trying NOT to be another Captain Boil restaurant. Similar to CB, they do serve Louisiana-style boiled seafood with a seasoning of your choice, priced per pound (and noted to be $1 less per pound than the seafood prices at CB). However they also have lobster rolls, soft shell crab sandwiches and baskets, lobster bisque, and will have ciders and craft beer (pending liquor license approval). I like that unlike CB, they use glassware, non-disposable utensils, and food is served in washable reusable containers (rather than plastic bags) for less environmental impact. The food was pretty decent. I ordered the soft shell crab basket and subbed out fries with a Caesar salad ($2 extra). The better deal is the soft shell crab sandwich which comes with salad and fries ($12.95). The lobster bisque had some chunks of lobster in it and had rich flavour.

They are still working out the kinks as that is what soft openings are for. My hubby's meal came out late but at least his salad was served with salad dressing unlike his mom's salad. My father in law was served what seemed like hard crusted rice, which was replaced quickly with fresh steamed rice upon complaint. They don't yet have their liquor license. The soft shell crab we were served was oilier than the fries served with it. All that being said, these bits of constructive feedback were fed back to one of the owners Tony who was eager to listen and improve customer experiences.

Would I come back to Good Catch? Absolutely! Even though on the surface they seem like another seafood boil restaurant, they are working to set themselves apart from the other restaurants of similar concept. I am looking forward to coming back in a few weeks after they've ironed out the hiccups identified during the soft opening and when they execute their full vision, and I can enjoy my meal with craft beers and ciders. 

3.5 stars.

4/100 (2017)"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and we ordered 2 lbs of clams, 1 salmon poke bowl and 1 fried oyster basket. 

Everything is delicious. 

We got garlic butter mild and they were delicious! The seafood in bags format still irks me but I let it roll. Taste was strong and they put a ton of garlic. I loved it. 

The pokebowl was great, though I think I like Poke Wrap better. The fish here was alright but it didn't scream any flavours at me. Still looked great though! 

The fried oyster basket came with cajun fries. This was what sealed the deal for me. I cannot handle spicy, but here, they have the cajun flavour but not the fire. It was absolutely delicious, I could have inhaled the whole thing. 

Total was $63 without tip, which rounds to $32  per person. Not a bad deal considering all the food! I'd love to come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"This seafood boil place is truly refreshing among all the others. Prime location too, right in the heart of downtown Markham - definitely makes an easy meal after a movie, or gym sesh etc. It's also HUGE and never really have to worry about seating here. It's also decked out really nicely - you can tell they really made an effort here.

They also have a lot of amazing sides - soups, an amazing salad that towers over my life (it's also soooo good.. but it's $18..) and a bunch of other stuff (chicken wings at a seafood boil? ..woaaah). One thing you must know - the cajun fries are bomb. Crispy, well seasoned and soft on the inside. I dipped it into the cajun sauce that came with the clams and that was even better. The sauce was super salty though and it definitely ended up burning a few of my tastebuds off - they're still burnt, over a week later. It was super great though and very tasty.
Also ordered yummy corn and potatoes with the cajun sauce.. god, I was SO full.
My friend also ordered the lobster roll, which was small but delicious? It also came with cajun fries and a caesar salad.

They're unique because they have a lot more selection on their menu 

It's more on the pricey side, around $80 for two but honestly, it was worth it and it is worth it once in awhile; #treatyoself 
Service is always really nice too.

I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"When you walk in, the first couple of things think you think is sports bar meets seafood boil restaurant and cool interior design. Compared to The Captain's Boil, this place is bigger in size and has more of a sports entertainment vibe (and has plenty of bars on tap to match). With TVs lining the walls and a huge screen at one end of the restaurant, this place is built for keeping up with your fave teams. A group of four, we arrived around 7pm on a Sunday evening and the place was packed with groups waiting to be called. It took about 30-40 minutes for a table to free up for us. Once seated, we were greeted by a friendly, kind, and patient host who was knowledgeable about market prices (for dungeness crab, lobster, & crawfish) and super helpful in navigating the menu. 

We ended up ordering 5 items: A pound of shrimps ($12.95/lb) with the Good Catch Blend in mild and a cup of vermicelli on the side ($2.00), gumbo soup ($5.95), the soft shell crab basket ($13.95) with sweet potato fries (extra $1.00 for the fries upgrade to sweet potato; regular fries are included in the $13.95), fried calamari ($13.95), and the picture-worthy lobster nachos ($29.95). 

I would have rated Good Catch higher if not for the general saltiness of most of the items we ordered. While the flavours were definitely on par with what you'd expect and even a bit more than average, the salt levels in the calamari, soft shell crab, and gumbo soup were too high for all of us which was a let-down because had it not been for the salt, the dishes would have been closer to perfect (especially the soup and calamari; of all the three, the calamari was the saltiest then the crab then the soup though maybe it's just the night we came in - I don't see other reviews with the same issue). The lobster nachos, however, were up there on our list - the gooey cheesy, chunks of lobster were tossed together with black olives, tomato chunks, sour cream, jalapenos, onions, tri-coloured tortilla chips, and, oh yeah, guac (yay for not having to pay extra for guac though at $29.95 it needs to be included haha). Only complaint is it needs more lobster. The tail it comes with is empty - I'm guessing they've emptied it out for you to mix in with the nachos but the head still has meat stuff in it so chow away. The shrimps with the Good Catch blend, on the other hand, were the real highlight. You go to these seafood boil places mainly to experience the bib, gloves, and delicious mess and the shrimps we ordered did not disappoint. The blend wasn't salty - it was perfect, I'd say even better than the Captain's Boil blend. 

I'd recommend Good Catch - I'd come again mainly for their bagged seafood and spice blends and their menu is pretty extensive (more choices than Captain's Boil though Captain's has good stuff not offered at Good Catch). At the end of the day, Good Catch has a great atmosphere to relax in and definitely fits the downtown vibe Markham is building."}
{"text":"Since it is located in the same area as the movie theatre and 10 other businesses, parking is going to be very difficult and frustrating. 

The first time I went it was during their soft opening so the oyster bar wasn't available yet. We ordered the oyster sliders, lobster roll, and two pounds of shrimp. The quality is better than other seafood places and their oyster sliders were amazing! 

The second time I went, it was very busy and we waited for almost 40 min just to seat 2 people. I called earlier to reserve but they said you wouldn't need to reserve, so make sure to reserve just incase! Or call before you leave to make sure it's not busy. When we got seated, it took them awhile to serve us and take our order and then they lost our order as well. We didn't see our waitress for awhile and had to make other employers find her for us. This time around we were able to try their oysters and I was not overly amazed with them either. 

Overall I do enjoy their food, but I think their employees have to work on serving and catering to their customers when it gets really busy because a lot of them were constantly running all over the place."}
{"text":"Went in and saw tons of tables available but they refuse to give it to groups of 2. We were told at least half an hour wait and alll the available tables were reserved. At least 3 or 4 tables left when we were waiting but they still said those were reserved too. A few other couples came in and were told at least half an hour- 45 min and all left as well.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Nice cozy seafood restaurant. We ordered the lobster nachos, Oyster sliders, Softshell Crab Fried rice and one lbs or Mussels and shrimp. Mussels and shrimps are huge and well seasoned. Impressed with the lobster Nacho with a lot of lobster meat on it. Oyster sliders are great as well. They offering a bit more than other similar restaurant like captains boil and the boil bar. I bought my on laws there and they liked it as well. A box of napkins are already on the table and a jug to put the left over. Made the whole dining experience bettee. Good job good catch."}
{"text":"After seeing many Facebook advertisements and my friends talking about being one of their places in Markham, I decided to finally come and visit this seafood restaurant with my friends. We came here on a Tuesday during the happy hour. They have happy hour every day from 3-6PM and 9PM-closing with a pretty decent craft beer drink list and other alcoholic drinks as they have a full bar. In addition to drink specials, they also have food specials during their happy hour such friend wings, fried oyster basket and the catch of the mussels. My friends and I ordered the happy hour specials and the fried shrimp basket. Food came out pretty quickly. Personally, it's one of my favourite new places to get drinks, enjoy good seafood and watch live sports games through their many tv's throughout the restaurant. Staff here are friendly and service was great during the 2 times I've been here. The staff were really kind to replace one of the beers that my friend spilt on me free of charge which shows they value their customers. You can make reservations here as it does get busy on the Friday and weekend evenings. In my personal opinion, I think they give you a decent amount of seafood for the price you're paying and I thoroughly enjoyed the Szechuan sauce with the mussels. There was just the right amount of heat and was quite flavorful. Overall, a great place to get your seafood fix and a pretty good place to get some cheap drinks during their happy hour special. Will definitely be a repeat customer for sure."}
{"text":"If you love seafood, coming to Good Catch is a no brainier! And If you gave me a choice of whether to come Good Catch or Captain's Boil, I would definitely lean towards Good Catch. The overall experience is more robust and pleasant here with more options to choose from. The fact that it's located in such a great location doesn't hurt either!

First impressions is the gigantic space here with big screen TVs all around. The interior is clean and spacious. There's cutlery, plates, glass cups, and this awesome custom tissue box that looks like shipping container. 

Coming with a larger group we were able to sample many things such as the good catch slaw, oyster sliders, etc. The good catch slaw was enjoyable and complimented the meal well but I'm not sure if it was worth the $20 it was. The oyster sliders were also very enjoyable and I liked how they had mini fried onion rings in there. Portion size could have been upped a bit for not only the slaw but also the fries. I really liked how they had a lot of other items besides seafood boils and I'll definitely be back to try things like their soft shell crab and lobster items!

There's not much to say about the seafood itself. The quality was great and we stuck to the mussels, clams, and shrimp. My favourite sauces here were the curry and Szechuan sauces. They were unique and flavourful. The Louisiana spice blend is too plain and too repetitive for me, though that's the same experience I had at other boils. I'd definitely stay away from lemon pepper however, as there was nothing to it."}
{"text":"Came here on a friday afternoon for their happy hour and really enjoyed it here. We got the wings with cajun fries which I believe was $8.99 and you can either choose honey garlic or buffalo. We got the honey garlic onr and it was so nice. It came with 6 large drum sticks and really crispy fries. This dish was on point. Then we got the seafood in a bag combo which consisted of 1lb of shrimp 1 lb of clams, corn, and mini potatoes for I think $22.95 (don't remember the exact price). We just got the good catch blend which I believe was cajun+ lemon pepper+ garlic. We chose mild for the spicy level and I still thought it was spicy. The seafood meat was fresh and the portions were great. However I thought it was a bit too salty for me. The sauce went well with the corn though. Everything came out hot. If you really like to taste the seafood freshness then this sauce might not be the best choice because it over powers the seafood's natural taste. Staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"They took extremely long we were ignored where ethnic people not Asian and they only sent us their ethnic workers I would never go back here the food was subpar and the price was high"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times after being introduced via the YEE because Good Catch Boil exceeded my expectations and had lasting first impressions!

The place is a comfortable place to lounge in and the ceilings are high. Also a lot of TV's playing sports games along the wall, including one with 9 screens on it. :oo

I like their new lunch special a lot. It's mess-free and all their seafood is fresh. It's hard to  believe, but my favourite items here are anything that has raw vegetables in it; or any of the salad options.

I like the poke (~$11-13), mainly for the salad components. Don't expect a heap of fish in the bowl though. They have the jumbo fish roe as well, but only about 6 pieces. Aside from that, all the veggies are super good. I even like the taste of the tuna in their tuna poke. Also, the tofu skins (which i regularly wouldn't order) and crispy taro crisps in their veggie poke were delish. My favourite poke is their salmon with either the sushi rice or zoodles and grapefruit sauce.

Their wings basket (~$7/6pcs or ~$13/12pcs) are SUPERB! A must-order. They're meaty and both sauce options (buffalo and honey-garlic) are delicious. Comes with cajun fries , which are SO good, they're like those crunchy & fluffy costco fries but with cajun spice powdered over top. *_*

I like their beer selection. It's served on tap which is extremely rare in Markham! Really like their Waterloo Grapefruit Raddler. Tastes like juice :P

I'd skip out on the Lobster Supreme Fries ($10 via Yelp checkin til June 30). Although there are lobster pieces in there they're quite small, and they're served over a different type of fries (soggy oven-baked fries instead of the cajun fries)"}
{"text":"Good Catch is shaping up to be one of my favourite restaurants in Markham and a potential usual spot!

I'm not the biggest seafoodie, but Good Catch knows how to make some delicious seafood. I love the customization options so everyone can get what the want. 

The seafood isn't the only good thing on the menu. Their Happy Hour offerings from 3PM-6PM and 9PM until closing features a small basket of wings with fries for only $8! It's an amazing value, so I usually order two of those if I come later at night. I've also seen their poke in their lunch menu, so I definitely have to come at noon to try that!

The atmosphere here is great, too. At earlier times, this place is a nice, bright restaurant you can enjoy with friends and family. At night, sports games can be found playing all over the place, with a huge screen on their back wall. I didn't expect the place to get loud, but playoff Raptors had everyone cheering!

Overall, the food, atmosphere, and value give this place a 5/5! Kudos to Good Catch!"}
{"text":"Such a great catch!!! If you're like me and always pass by this place you should definitely park and come on in next time. This place definitely hits the mark of a seafood dive! I thought there would only be shrimps/mussels available in those plastic bags that u eat with gloves but the menu is actually much more diverse. You can order lobster nachos, fried oyster sliders (HIGHLY RECCOMEND), fried rice, and even a slaw (very great tasting salad). 

I did get a chance to try some of everything and I have to say they've really spent the time curating their dishes to be so unique. Starting with the slaw, the dressing was this sweet & sour like sauce that enhanced the flavour of the crispy noodle topping, peppers, peanuts and dried figs. This would be something I would come back for! The wings are also massive and fall off the bone tender. I don't normally like buffalo sauce but theirs is so creamy and tasty that I'm sure you would be converted too! 

Onto the seafood, the good catch sauce is the best one in my opinion. It's sweet, spicy, smokey and delicious, I even spooned some from the bag to my rice!! The shrimps and mussels are a great hefty size which impressed me and super fresh tasting as well! 

The restaurant is HUGE and they've really thought of everything to improve your experience. My booth seat had space to tuck your purse and jacket in!!! How crazy is that?! You don't have to sit crammed with your belongings because you can store them IN the seat!! Loved that extra touch!"}
{"text":"Had a decent lunch!
1) a glass of craft beer: farmhouse garden
2) 1 lb of clams
3) soft shell crab

craft beer: farmhouse garden (score 3.5/5)
it tastes refreshing but it has an after taste.

clams (score 4/5)
clams in Good Catch Blend sauce. The sauce has a rich taste of garlic which added flavour to the clams. The downside is the sauce is a bit too salty.

softshell crab (score 5/5)
the dish comes with two sides, French Fries and Ceasar Salad. The French Fries are crispy and crunchy. Salad is fresh and refreshing. The main component of the dish, soft shell crab is placed on top of one slice of a bun with chunks of mangoes on top of the crab. Just the crab itself already tastes the seafood sweetness taste. Chunks of mango on top enriched the sweetness of the taste. It is quite thoughtful to see the chef decorate the other slice  of the bun with words, \"Good Catch\" on it. Luke this dish very much."}
{"text":"I end up here way too often throughout a week for their late night happy hour. Wings basket is too value, and the discounted drinks add to the intensity. I still imbibe in their regular priced stuff since the taps are rotated frequently, and that really fuels my alcoholic curiosity.
I'll be honest... not a fan of the menu or style. But the beer taps win me over."}
{"text":"Food
A fan of their good catch blend sauce and garlic/butter sauce.
Shrimps and mussels are usually part of our seafood selections by the pound, and could be filling.
Their Cajun seafood fried rice (4/5) was pretty good and had a good amount of seafood in it. It might feel a little bland after having so much of their flavorful seafood with their sauce selections, so we ended up mixing the remaining sauce with the fried rice. 
Soft shell crab basket (2/5) was a really small portion, and felt like eating oil. 
Wings & fries (3.5) only had 2 flavors to select from, and we selected honey garlic. All of the wings had a bunch of broken bones

Drink
Seafood restaurant with a good amount of beer selection in Markham.
It's my 3rd time back and getting a flight of beer is always a must for me, paired with my seafood.

Environment
It's a nice and pretty spacious environment to chat with friends/family on the table or watch some games on multiple TV screens."}
{"text":"First Impressions
=============
Great atmosphere and concept.  Sports bar meets Cajun Seafood Boil house.

It's like an upgraded version of Captain Boil.
- Bucket at the end of the table to clear your shells
- NAPKIN dispenser, something much needed at other places.  No more paper towel rolls with other people's greasy finger prints on it!

Service
======
Waitress was friendly, service was quick.  Had a few issues with the food and drinks, it was resolved.

DIRTY GLASS ISSUE: 
We asked for water, a few glasses of ice water and a few glasses of warm water.

The warm water came in really dirty glasses.  The waitress swapped it out, but no apology or discount off our bill.  

It would have been nice to receive a coupon or discount or a \"I'm so sorry about that,\" but--nope.  

LUKE WARM COKE ISSUE:
We ordered a Diet Coke and a regular Coke.  Apparently they serve the fancy Glass-Bottle Coke at this restaurant, so no refills.

The Diet Coke was fine.
The regular Coke was luke warm.  

I asked if they had any cold cokes that she can swap out.  She offered a glass with ice.  

I know I'm being picky, by the whole reason you serve Coke in the fancy glass bottle is to enjoy drinking it out of the fancy frosted glass bottle and not have it diluted with ice--keeping in mind you are paying a premium for this glass bottle too.

I asked if she could check if there are cold Coke in the back but she didn't even check.  Just offered glass with ice.  Fine.

The glass with ice, had about 6 small pieces of ice in it.  This is not enough to make the drink cold without all of the ice melting and watering down the Coke.

Yes it's a small detail, but it's all about the small details.  And when you start adding up all the small things that went wrong it can quickly turn a pleasant experience to something that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

This was one of those things.  In my mind I was expecting Hot Cajun Seafood Boil, and a frosty ice-cold Coke.  

What I ended up getting was Hot Cajun Seafood Boil with a slightly colder than Luke warm watery Coke.


Food
====
Food is good.  Much like Captain Boil's food and sauce.  They have much more variety and selection or non-Boil foods as well.

Sandwiches, fried rice, casseroles, all with a Seafood twist.

Side toppings to go with your Boil bag had less selection than Captain's.  We were sad they had no Lotus Roots :(. 

We ordered mussels, shrimp, crab and fries.  All were delicious and cooked just right.  

Sauce was seasoned well.

Would I go back?
=============
Yes.  I'll skip the Cola, and order Beer.  This was they can't offer me a cup with ice if the beer is warm.

:)"}
{"text":"This is where people want seafood and this is a to-go place! Recommended food from us: Oyster Sliders (3 pieces an order). We order Kuushi for a dozen raw oysters (not bad...I like Kuushi more than Kumamoto, If you like small oysters like I do). we ordered mussels, corn, shrimps with Si-Chuen spicy style (not really spicy spicy, even our friend could eat it when she said she can't do spicy). Fried chicken dishes are good as people said about, so we decided to have wings!! And wings were delicious. 
The restaurant space is very spacious!!! Would definitely go back to visit again the next seafood time."}
{"text":"It is a very pricey restaurant even taking into consideration that it is a boil house. This is my second time. The service was good. The first time I had a pound of shrimp withe the mild house sauce which was loaded with garlic. I like garlic but it was so over powering. At the other boil houses I've been to I order the pound of shrimp and it feels unending. The pound here was disappointing and I walked away still hungry even though I got a rice and corn. The corn was a dismal waste of money. For $1 you only get two pieces which add up to 1/2 an ear of small corn. I thought I should give it a second chance and this time I ordered the oyster sliders and soft shell crab basket. Both were okay. The soft shell crab was really small and the oyster sliders were good. The food is good, but if you want amazing, I don't think this is it. A good place if you have a big budget and want to have a meal with friends before a movie. Seafood wise, there are a lot of amazing restaurants out there that will give you more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday during the winter storm and it was quite empty as expected. Make sure you park closer to the employee parking lot because you can't access this place through the inside!

With 9 adults and a few babies, we ordered 3 pounds of clams, mussels and shrimps to share in three different bags. Everyone else ordered their individual additional items and I went with the lobster roll.  This place is very similar to Captain's Boil, you pick a pound of seafood and choose your sauce. They also have the house sauce which is a mix of Lemon Pepper, Garlic Butter and Cajun sauce. The house sauce was good with just enough of spiciness even with mild, the Lemon Pepper and Garlic Butter are great too, it really depends on which seafood you order.  I personally prefer Garlic Butter with clams.  Overall, the seafood is pretty fresh and tasty, although it was slightly a bit too salty.  The lobster roll on the other hand wasn't too impressive, lobster amount is generous but it didn't give me the wow moment, the bread was good though I have to say.

Make sure you check in on yelp after their opening promotion is over, because checking in on yelp will give you 10%!!"}
{"text":"I can literally eat here all the time, hands down my favourite place. 
Staff is really nice, they are definitely engaging and regularly check in to make sure you're good. 
Menu is great, there is so much variety and it's way different compared to other boil houses. 
I'm regularly here for a laid back date night- we usually grab a couple drinks, watch a game and have good food-- can't go wrong with mussels & Cajun Fries."}
{"text":"Busy place on a Saturday. Great service. Not bad food. Just felt that my Lobster Roll platter seemed kind of petit for the price paid for it. Was told the coleslaw was eliminated due to patrons stating that it was bland. Should of replaced it with something else like beans instead of an empty spot - or at least increase the french fry count or the Caesar salad. The rest of our party fairly enjoyed their food which was great. Would love to go back when it's quieter like on a week day."}
{"text":"This place is similar to Captain's boil, they have similar menu but a little bit more variety. Their house sauce is pretty good and a good but I personally prefer Captain's boil sauce. Their sliders don't look as good as the pictures but still pretty good. Overall, pretty good bar food and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Finally, it's here!! :) 

I have been seeing this place for months and was wondering when it will be opened. The place has officially opened with a soft opening this week since February 2nd, Still working some kinks here, I think the place is off to a great start. 

You may think? What, another copycat of Captain Boil?!?!  Captain Boil may be the trend setter of opening this type of restaurant in the GTA and in Canada but they are hardly the originator and creator since this type of restaurant has been in existence for a long time down the South.  
What's so different this place as compared to others?      Well, the food is different and the sauce is hardly the same IMHO.  Also, the vibe is this place is quite different from other Captain Boil and Boil Bar or other similar restaurants. 

I went there quickly to check out this place on Thursday and it was impressive. 6000 square feet of massive space and lots of TV's in various size, especially a huge one on one side of the room. It's a great place to hang out, chill and catch some games. The restaurant is quite trendy and modern, with enough spaces to sit a few hundreds people!   I love the vibe of this restaurant and how the place didn't go nuts in decorating with seafood artifacts. Variety of seats are offered. There are booths, tables and also high tables and chairs on the sides if you feel like sitting higher. 

When you walk in, you might be captivated with the big golden Popeye in the middle of the room. Quite cute that I had to take some selfie with Popeye~ AYE!!    

Here are a few items that I tried on Friday.

-Mussels: Big juicy mussels.. Quite a good portion for 1 pound. 
-Shrimps: Quite a good portion for 1 pound
-Cajun Seafood Fried Rice:  Comes with Scallops and shrimps (though small ones).  I was presently surprised with the rice. I ordered it as I was worried we won't be full from the food but it was a nice portion and the fried rice was good!  I expected to be spicy (with two peppers) but it wasn't. 
-Lobster Roll - Had it hot.. Delicious lobster roll but a tad expensive, leaving you wanting more. Comes with yummy cajun fries and the salad vinaigrette is very zesty!! 

I will be back again to try more items! There are so much things on the menu and I recommend going with groups of at least 4 people to try more things. 

The restaurant is also open for lunch on the week-ends so do go check it out and take advantage of the limited 10% discount off promotion on food when you check in with the YELP App. 

Service is good and the owner Tony asked us for feedback.  The restaurant doesn't have a liquor license yet but it won't be long because it's available as I noticed this place is hooked up with some great liquid vendors.  The lobster nachos is temporarily not available but will be coming back soon :D"}

{"text":"ooooooops Forgot to review this one.
With Captain's Boil, Boil Bar becoming the popular food-trend it's no surprised they opened up another Boil House in downtown Markham, located in the same plaza as the Cineplex. Coming here to for a bday dinner we were delighted with the decor and the overall ambiance.  The service was exceptional and efficient.  As for foods, here's what we had:
**Lobster Nachos: beautifully decorated, lots of colors, greens, lobster drizzled with sour cream and cheese.  Total bar seafood delight.
**Oysters: Served on a bed of ice and some lemons on the side, this was a nice treat. 
**Cajun Shrimp: for those who know, served in a bag full of flavor and overall goodness, just don't rub your eyes or else you'll regret it later.
**Fried Rice: Taking a chance on this, a mountain of rice with seafood, it was actually delicious. 

Overall the place is great, it can get on the pricey side as it's easy to go nuts here with all the options they've got for flavoring and sides."}
{"text":"5/5 

Service: I came here for a corporate lunch on a Friday, expecting it to be crazy busy. We made reservations ahead of time, and when we walked in at 12pm, we were seated right away. The place wasn't as busy as I thought it would be, but there was a steady flow. The servers were very nice, although while most of our food came out quickly, two peoples' orders did not and they had to sit and watch us eat while the servers were figuring out what the mess-up was. Other than that, it was great... so great that they are still getting a 5/5!

Location: Birchmount and Enterprise... downtown Markham. It's an \"up and coming\" area, and right now has a few condos, office buildings, and stores around it. Very clean and not too busy (yet).

Food: AMAZING. I've been to many boil houses, and this is the best. The options are great... if you don't want seafood in a bag and to have to wear gloves and a bib (i.e., corporate luncheon), there are so many other things you can order. I had the oyster sliders, which I highly recommend. I also had a bite of the lobster grilled cheese, which was also amazing. Very flavourful and filling (good portion sizes), but awful if you're on a diet ;)

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda mixed on this review, food was tasty but service was just a disappointment. When we arrived everyone else around us was getting served but we couldn't even get water. Every other table who came after us was being served immediately. 

We ordered oyster slider, lobster roll hot, large salad slaw, soft shell crab basket and combination D crab and shrimp mixed. The food was quite good the combination was mixed with garlic butter and it tasted phenomenal, the salad was eye opening and refreshing, and the soft shell crab basket was good. My only gripe was the fries were too over salted with Cajun seasoning and turned into a little over salty.

Was a interesting visit but won't visit again once is enough for me."}
{"text":"A really awesome environment to be with friends and family. The menu is pretty good. My only criticism is that a lot of their sauces come with a lot coarsely chopped garlic that it overpowers the sauce and makes the various sauces almost indiscernible from one another. For that reason, I always get them on the side so I can dip my seafood. Happy hour is the best time to go for the price and if you choose a slower weeknight, the restaurant is quieter. Wings are pretty good and cheap as well."}
{"text":"Came here last Thursday. I ordered their warm lobster roll and oyster sliders, as well as crablegs with good catch blend sauce. They were all delicious. I love how they have boiled seafood as well as other seafood choices such as softshell crab sandwich and lobster roll. This sets them apart from Captain's Boil and also gives more food choices to customers. I personally cannot eat an entire meal of boiled seafood with sauces as the sauce gets too overwelming and salty for myself. So having sandwich options along with boiled seafood all in one restaurant is a plus for me! I definitely recommend you to try them out! Staff was extremely friendly as well."}
{"text":"A solid 4** for this place. In terms of food quality, service and ambience. Passed by quite a few times and was wondering when they would open. 

They are currently in soft opening stage..we visited on a Thursday night and it was already quite busy...I can imagine how it will be like when it officially opens... 

Word spreads around quickly....if you think they are like a copycat Capital Boil, that would be incorrect and an understatement...capital boil opened too quickly sacrificing quality...another discussion for another day.. Lol.. 

Back to Good Catch, we were served promptly to a table, our Server, Carrie (sorry if I spelt it wrong)  was very nice and advised us in the beginning that it's kind of a busy night and she will try her best to attend to us. I didn't feel any service was compromised.. 

We order some appys, oyster sliders (yummm)  lobster nachos (must try)  oysters... They were all well presented and delicious...the taste in everything worked like marriage... ..we ordered quite some alcohol, 3 bottles of wine,  flight beer and etc...we ordered dungeoness crab with curry, that was very delish!  The curry is better than Saigon Star, personally speaking...mussels with Good Catch blend and clams... Everything worked well... The sauces were not overpowering that compromised the seafood...they are open till late! 

Alcohol pricing was very reasonable! $45-60 for a bottle of wine is not expensive..in comparison to any other restaurants...

All in all,  coming back with no doubts!!"}
{"text":"This place was REALLY GOOD. Service is very fast when they're not busy - food came in 5 minutes. Restaurant decor is also super cute! We got 5 lbs of food for 4 people with two sides and it was enough to fill me up. I'd recommend the Cajun flavour :)"}
{"text":"A great seafood restaurant and bar in downtown markham. I wouldn't say it is the greatest, but if you're craving seafood it is somewhere to check out. 

Prices are decent and portion sizes are good. Service was great and servers were attentive. The restaurant wasn't that busy, so not sure about when it gets busier. 

We ordered the oyster sliders, fish sliders and salmon poke bowl.

Interior was very nice and modern. There were large screen tv to watch a game when they are on.

Would come back to try other items. 

Lunch menu is served from 1130-1500."}
{"text":"At first when this place opened I thought it was another one of those boil bars where you order seafood, they cook it and you choose choice of sauce. They do have that selection on the menu however they have a lot more than that. They have a good selection of fried seafood as well. Soft shell crab is a must have, either you choose the basket or sandwich, you get the ENTIRE crab!!!! Lobster roll is another recommended choice, the amount of lobster meat overfills your bun. Meat and bun ratio almost 1:1! 

The atmosphere of the place is amazing, very spacious and tv's everywhere, perfect if you wanna watch the game. They have 18 different craft beer on tap. 

Although most things are served in disposables, they're still trying to keep it to a minimal by serving drinks in glasses and aluminum cups which are in a barrel shape, that's pretty cool!

Definitely worth coming again but groups of 4 or more is recommended, just cause you can try more and different things."}
{"text":"What a Good Catch in Markham - definitely coming back for more flavourful seafood, fried sliders, and craft drinks! The portions are perfect to share between four, and the lively atmosphere with sports games on the big screens makes for a great night out. 

I highly recommend the Oyster Sliders and Good Catch Slaw - the best I've had! Their boils were decent, though I found the sauces to be a tad too salty. I also discovered the Waterloo Grapefruit Radler tonight and loved it - a sweet, bubbly taste to balance the savoury food. Overall, a great choice for a delicious meal and a fun hands-on dining experience (be prepared to get daucy)!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. It was very spacious and comfy, and enjoyed the number of tv's that were around. But had a few issues with the food and customer experience. I ordered 1lb of mussels in the garlic butter sauce and 1lb of shrimp in the good catch sauce. I found the sauces to be watered down and didn't have enough flavour. For the lobster nachos charging at 29.99, I was quite disappointed with the amount of lobster that was present. It was beautifully pieced together with the lobster head and tail but the tail was completely empty and the lobster meat that was on the nachos was very scarce - nachos were good but wouldn't recommend spending 30 bucks on this. Also didn't like the fact that I heard the server ask a number of times to customers if they've been to Captians Boil and then saying that the food they have at their restaurant is waaaay better then their competitors. I think you should just leave it up to the customers to decide."}
{"text":"For a birthday a group of us went to Good Catch. It was perfect since we shared a ton of food and had the chance to try a bit of everything. The menu is very broad with many options that can be customized. The Cajun fries are so thin and crispy! The soft shell crab came with a tasty dipping sauce that was great with everything. I would recommend the good catch house seasoning blend if getting one of the steamed bags. Our server was Jo Yee. She is so sweet and was great at making sure we ordered enough and really helped us pick our dishes!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday during happy hour (3p-6p, and after 9p) with three other people and we shared 2lbs of mussels, 1 basket of honey garlic wings and 1 basket of deep fried oysters. We loved the wings and oysters. Great crispy deep fried oysters and wings with evenly flavored sauce. We tried the sweet potato fries and cajun fries. Both were great- the sweet potato fries were delicious and the cajun fries are thin and crispy. Price point is reasonable for the happy hour but there are some other stuff that are higher. The quality is great and I would definitely come back to try their other offerings. I heard a lot of good things about their oyster sliders. They have something for everyone whenever you like seafood or not because they offer a variety of non-seafood dishes as well."}
{"text":"Even though I've heard a lot about these various Boil Places. I haven't had the chance to try them out. Today a group my friends took me out for dinner. So we came here. Place was quite spacious and decor was suiting to their theme. Once you enter through the front doors you are greeted with a gigantic metallic statue of Popeye the Sailorman! 

I wanted to try their raw oysters, but it was quite pricy, and I knew my friends were treating. So didn't want to break their wallet. Next time.

My hubby tried their sampler beer. Mild to Strong, quite refreshing and tasted great.

We ordered various items. 
But I mainly came for the seafood in bags. 
Never tried crawfish before, so for sure I went for that. Chose the Schezwan Sauce to go with it. 

Other items we order was Good Catch Blend Shrimps and Garlic Butter Mussels.

My friends also ordered the Oyster Sliders, Lobster Roll, Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, & Sweet Potato Fries.

For me I loved all 3 seafood items, the flavours were bang on. Spice level for the Schezwan was just right for me. Might be too spicy for some. Shrimps were quite large and sauce was very well balanced. Mussels were very tasty but way too much garlic, I had to brush some off lol. 

I tried a bite of my hubby's lobster roll I thought it was tasty, but the size was quite small. 

My friend enjoyed her soft shell crab sandwich a lot. And the Oyster sliders were very well reached. 

Would definitely come back to try more of the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday with family friends at around lunch time and it was almost empty. We ordered the slaw salad and the lobster grilled cheese sandwiches

The salad is so big it could easily be split by four people. There's a nice refreshing taste to it - very similar to balsamic and with a good crunch to it as well. There are also figs in this salad which was a nice touch! 

The lobster grilled cheese comes with Cajun fries. The fries are AMAZING!! They are thin and incredibly crispy... I think they are the best fries I've ever had. I will order an additional side of fries the next time I'm here!!

The grilled cheese tasted pretty great as well! I never thought that cheese and lobster would go well together.. but it really is a match made in heaven. So. Delicious. 

We also got a scoop of mint chocolate ice cream, which comes in a small bowl. It's very creamy and there's lots of dark chocolate chips in it. 

The service was a little bit slow, but otherwise pretty great. I'm giving this place a four star because it is a little bit on the expensive side for the quantity."}
{"text":"This place is great! From the moment we walked in and were greeted so warmly by the staff, we knew it was going to be good. We weren't disappointed. Fun atmosphere with a giant Popeye statue right in the middle of the place. The tables are covered in paper and each setting comes with a lobster bib, plastic gloves and a big tin of paper towels. You know it's going to get messy. If the supplies aren't enough, there is a big copper sink where you can go and wash up. So go ahead and dig into that big plastic bag filled with delicious fish and sauce. Eat like there's no one watching, as the sign says. Our party had the lobster roll (excellent), the fried oyster basket (yum), prawns with corn and okra in cajun sauce (really good) and mussels in good catch sauce (satisfying) The beer selection is great. We got a table right away but I have a feeling once the word is out, this will be a busy place. I will go back here again very soon."}
{"text":"\"Definitely coming back here!\"

What time we arrived/Wait time?
We went on a Saturday evening around 6pm. The place was busy so we gave them our phone number and we got put on a wait list for 15-20 minutes because we requested a booth. The hostess was very hospitable.

Atmosphere?
It was a fun atmosphere with a wide variety of different age groups. It is family-friendly and great for late night drinks with friends. It's very colourful and very creative space. We loved eating with our hands and getting dirty - it's part of the experience!

Service/Staff?
Our server was very efficient and knowledgable about the menu and gave us some great suggestions. Nothing too special and over the top.

Food/Menu?
We ordered the oyster sliders to start, and soft shell crab fried rice, a lb. of shrimp (with the good catch blend sauce) & a lb. of clams (with lemon pepper sauce). The oyster sliders were so tasty if you like fried stuff! The soft shell crab is a bit spicy and not too greasy/salty - also it comes in a big portion. Lastly, the bags of shrimp and clams were fun to eat and very good."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to grab a meal before or after a movie. The menu has quite a bit of selection and I settled on a the soft shell crab sandwich with cajun fries. The fries were well seasoned and very tasty. My soft shell crab was deep fried and battered, topped up with corn and a sauce. I paired my dinner with a beer flight tasting: 4 x 5oz craft beers. This is highly recommended to try out different types and perhaps a new favorite! My server was friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Its similarity of captains boil attracted me to try this place. Note that this place is still trying to get a liquor license.  The order was clams, mussels, lobster roll, and soft shell crab. Clams and mussels were about 12 bucks a pound.  Came in a bag.  Both were a bit too salty. The soft shell crab.was good, it was perfectly warm.  The lobster roll' s lobster meat was fine, but the bun was not toasty enough, and not buttery/garlicy enough.  If they improved the two the lobster roll is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with some friends and with two newborns in the mix, it's important for us FTM to go to baby friendly restaurants to not get overwhelmed by the chaos that can happen! We came on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm and there was no wait. The restaurant is so spacious overall, and at our table, we were able to fit two strollers. The handicap washroom had a change table and the cleanliness was perfect, didn't make me squirm and want to brave the cold to change my baby back in the car. 
We ordered several of their poke bowls, lobster grilled cheese, lobster Mac and cheese and their soft shell crab sandwich. For the poke bowls, love how there is the zoodle option. Having had many poke bowls from downtown locations, I took off a star because the portion could have been bigger - the salmon/tuna pieces could have been bigger, and there could have been a bit more sauce. The lobster grilled cheese and mac and cheese were delicious chunks of lobster mixed in gooey cheese. I think it wouldn't hurt to have a small salad to go with it though. Presentation wise it looked really bare with just the sandwich and fries. The soft shell crab sandwich looked amazing, the mango salsa was a good way to balance the greasiness of anything fried. Seems like there's some inconsistency with the sandwich since some posters had poorly fried soft shell crab and ours was just fine. My friend who doesn't like seafood much actually enjoyed it! 
I think the food here is a bit overpriced to be honest, but for the comfort of bringing along our babies, it's certainly a restaurant that I would consider making regular visits. Next time, if I don't have my little one with me, I'll try their bags of seafood!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge seafood fan but never fell into the GTA boil house hype until I tried Good Catch! The restaurant is larger than expected with some booths, regular tables and high tables. Many large screen TVs - a sports bar theme/good for groups. My first thought was how uncomfortable the booth seat was - why doesn't the seat cushion extend to the back? ie when I lie back there is a few inches gap of wood? Anyways, moving on - the food was better than expected! 

Between 3 people we shared 5 lbs of seafood (clams, mussels, shrimp priced $11-13~/lb) You can choose the type of seafood, type of sauce, spice level, and any additions (we added corn each at $1 each, not the 'chewy' type of corn I usually eat). My favorite was the clams in garlic butter!! (which I was most hesitant because I was worried the clams would be tiny, but ended up being decent size and fresh, and very flavourful garlic butter sauce). Mussels & shrimp good size as well, and everything was fresh. The sauces were not overly salty (as I had heard about for other boil bars) and complemented the seafood well. Good Catch Blend & Cajun were quite similar, ordered at medium spice level but was not spicy; lemon pepper good too. 

We also ordered Cajun Fries - good fries but could use more seasoning, not very cajun/spicy. 

For drink, I had the Grapefrut Radler - very good, sweet and doesn't have the beer taste!

Total came to ~$32 per person (before tips; 10% off in soft opening). 

I would recommend this place for a new type of dining experience. You get a bib and gloves so it's not too messy!"}
{"text":"Best boil house in the area! Their house sauce beats Captains Boil every time. Located in the same plaza as the Markham VIP theatres, Good Catch is in a prime location at the centre of \"downtown\" Markham. It also has tons of parking spots and is near GoodLife and the Markham YMCA so you can go work off the food you devoured right after. 

The food there is hella bomb. Everything you get, you won't be disappointed, except for maybe the lobster nachos. Other than that, I recommend the oyster sliders and the lobster roll. Other than being delicious, it'll be perfect to put on your snap stories to make your friends jealous

The beer selection is awesome as they have a whole selection of craft beers, so make sure you try them all (responsibly)! I personally recommend the Canucks, well that's what I think it's called..."}
{"text":"This place is great for seafood. The bill could get pricey if you order appetizers and oysters. I normally get an order of shrimp and of course with a dozen oysters. The oysters are fresh every time. I recommend making reservations because its always busy. I've waited 30 mins before but the food is definitely worth it. Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"I came here last week as a guest at a Yelp event and liked it so much, I just had to come back. I brought along a couple of cousins who were celebrating their birthdays, an aunt and an uncle. We ordered the gumbo, snow crab legs, shrimps, soft shelled crab, Cajun fries, corn, potatoes, garlic bread, and the slaw.

All the food was fresh and tasted really good, especially if you like garlic. We love garlic! The slaw was enough for the five of us to share. We were all stuffed at the end of our meal.

The service was very good, from the moment we entered, through dinner, and right until we left. Our servers were very attentive and checked on us several times.

I'll be back again..."}
{"text":"Update:
Took the kids for dinner.  Thumbs up from them too.  The little one (11 years old) had almost 1lb of shrimp with corn and half a soft shell crab.  The 13 year old had 1lb of mussels with corn and fries.  Both happy kiddos.
******** 
Was on the way to our usual pork bone soup when we went by Good Catch.  We go by there every day to drop our son off at school and it was highly recommended by a few people.  So, we made a U-turn and stopped here.
It's a nice big bright space with all the windows.  Seated quickly and greeted by all the staff.
The waitress was super nice and helpful.
You pick your seafood, it doesn't have to be just one.  Price by the pound or market price.  Plus, \"regular\" menu.

Ordered: 
1lb mussels with sausage and corn with curry sauce
1lb shrimp with okra and corn with garlic butter sauce
Fried oyster sliders

Everything came really quickly.  The seafood with sauce comes in a plastic bag so you put on the bib and gloves and get to work.  There's a bucket to toss shells.
The curry tastes like vietnamese green curry.  My husband is iffy with curry in that he loves it but it doesn't always love him which was the case with this but he stills talks about how good it was.  
The garlic butter sauce is deadly good with nice big pieces of chopped garlic.  The shrimp was large and cooked just right.
The oysters were a little lost in the sliders because the sauce overwhelmed them.  However, they were still good.  The bread was actually the best part, really delicious.  
I'd definitely go back. There were a lot of families but also would be a good date option."}
{"text":"Its been a long time since i've been impressed by a restaurant. The service was great and the food came quick. My bf and I got the crab sandwich and lobster roll (cold). Both sandwiches have a hefty portion of seafood and come with fries and caesar salad. Their fries are like costco fries which are really the best fries on earth. If i'm really gonna nit pick, the salad could use less dressing. YOU HAVE GOT TO GET THE LOBSTER ROLL. Not sure how good the hot one is but the cold was perfect. I would legit eat it everyday if i could. The soft shell crab came with a super soft bun, a little too soft but the mango salsa saved it. We got an order of cajun clams (they were out of crawfish but you can't really blame them, it was a holiday). Definitely should have gotten medium and not mild. They don't put as much spicy seasoning compared to captains boil."}
{"text":"It's hard not to compare Good Catch with Captain's Boil!  Good Catch: more spacious, plenty of seating, nicer décor and ambience, better service, great beer selection, their shrimps and clams are much bigger and tastier, there are more flavors and add-ons for the seafood, more TV and bigger screens!    Their menu has more varieties; soup, salad, sliders, burgers, and even fried rice.  Oyster sliders are must-have.  Corn ($1) and vermicelli($2) are the two musts to be added to your catch : )"}
{"text":"A great addition for the cineplex markham area. Sometimes you crave seafood and then a movie. Service was good. Food was typical for these kind of seafood boil places. Nothing wow or outstanding. But nothing bad either. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is an awesome seafood spot - there are so many options on the menu that I could see myself coming back multiple times just to make sure I've tried everything. The lobster nachos look amazing!"}
{"text":"Have been waiting for this seafood bar for awhile!  Located inside downtown Markham, Good Catch is a good place to grab fresh seafood & watch sport games.  Start off with a lobster bisque $8.95, flavourful with lots of lobster meat.  Then a tray of three oyster sliders $13.95, enjoy them while fresh!  Now is time for a pound of fresh clams $12.95 with good catch blend sauce.  This is the soft opening now and the shop is still waiting for its liquor license .  Can't wait to come back to try again when the full bar is open with tons of beer on tap."}
{"text":"Loved the soft-shell crab and cajun clams.  Fish and chips were pretty decent but not the best I've had. Servers were kind, helpful & friendly but kept disappearing even though the place wasn't that crowded. We had to keep ordering food because one item perp person just wasn't enough. We ended up with $100 bill for four people (two of whom were kids ). Maybe we just loved the food or have big appetites but in hindsight it didn't seem like a good value for money. Hindsight. Because we finished everything..it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food (lunch) 3 stars.  Services +0.5 star.  Venue/decor/ambience +0.5 star.

This review is for a lunch experience.

I had a lunch with 3 co-workers on a Friday.  Three of us order poke bowls (2 salmon, 1 tuna).  One ordered a fish slider.  The general consensus was the food looked picture perfect.  The opinion of the taste of the food ranged for alright (tuna poke and slider) to good (salmon poke). The two coworkers said their salmon with spicy mayo poke bowls tasted good.  My tuna with teriyaki sauce poke bowl tasted all right but nothing blew my mind in terms of freshness or taste profile.  Maybe the spicy mayo sauce tastes better?  The three of us agreed that the sushi rice could be better.  

The services was good as a lunch experience.  Our waitress was polite and effective.  Our glasses were refilled without us asking.  The food arrived in reasonable time for a lunch rush. 
 
The venue was clean, spacious and well decorated.  The wall televisions were top notched.  I think I will enjoy watching a sport game here over a pub."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food, it's a great imitation of The Boiling Crab from Los Angeles. The only negative thing is that they are short staff for a place so busy. It took 15 minutes for the server to come take our order of drinks then another 15 minutes to order our food. It's at least 45 mins wait for this place, highly recommend getting reservations before coming."}
{"text":"The sauce tasted the same between lemon pepper, good catch and Cajun to us! Wasn't sure if it's the server's mistake or they should be tasted the same. Everything else were so so, like salad and soft shell crab, but the oysters and cherry stones were good. However, if oysters were the best thing there, should I go Diana seafood instead?! Service was attentive! Well, maybe we expected too much, once is good enough!"}
{"text":"I have been to Good Catch Boil House on a few occasions for lunch and for the most part it has been a good experience. The restaurant area covers a large floor space with both booths and tables. The restaurant is never full and but it can a bit noisy with the big screen TVs. Napkins are stored in mini-freight train like containers.

The atmosphere is akin to a sports bar. There is stool seating near the kitchen area as well sinks where you can wash your hands after handling some lobster, oyster or crab shells.

The lobster roll, Good Catch Slaw, and soft shell crab basket are the items I would recommend from the menu. The price point for the lobster roll is a bit high but of good quality. I have also tried mussels and salmon POKÉ bowl. At the next opportunity I would like to try the Cajun Seafood Fried Rice.

Also Good Catch is open 365 days a year. You can catch a movie at the Cineplex, go to the gym, grab a coffee, pastries, pick up art supplies or a new golf set afterwards in heart of downtown Markham. 

Looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"I came here last night with 3 of my friends and we ordered a feast!  We started with the oyster sliders, good catch slaw, calamari, lobster nachos, and raw oysters.  Everything was really tasty, flavourful, and fresh.  Although, we were eating a lot of fried foods, the food didn't feel \"heavy\".  I loved the presentation of the lobster nachos and I will definitely be back for more oysters!

For our next round, we ordered lobster with corn in the Szechuan sauce and shrimp with okra in the Good Catch Blend.  Careful, the food's hot, so make sure you wear your gloves because it gets messy too :)  I was surprised how spicy the Szechuan sauce was -- there was a really good kick to it!  The shrimp and okra were both really good and my friend who can't eat spicy food, loved the Good Catch blend.

We ordered some beer flights and we were able to try 4 different types of beer on tap.  My husband enjoyed the \"Harry Porter\", which is a dark beer that tastes like coffee (similar to Guinness).  My favourite was the Shumei IPA, which was sweet, light, and a little hoppy.

Service was excellent and the atmosphere was fun with a Raptors vs OKC game on.  It's a sports bar, but you can definitely bring your family of all ages.  I'll be back with my family of seafood lovers!"}
{"text":"Bad catch, not good catch. 

Came here twice, second time for lobster take out as it was extremely loud there.  Upon bringing the lobster home and eating, I noticed the meat was quite hard and difficult to eat, knew it probably wasn't fresh.  Later I had stomach discomfort and immediately knew it was the lobster.

My guess is because they knew it was for take out they gave me a dead lobster thinking I wouldn't go back and complain about it.  Seafood especially lobster/crab needs to be fresh and alive before cooking as it goes bad quickly.

Also the Cajun and Good Catch Blend sauces tasted very similar, like soy sauce/Szechuan flavour.  I guess because it's Asian owned.

Lesson learned.  Stay away counterfeit Captain's Boil and stick to the original.  Waste of $65."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this restaurant is 10x better than Captain's Boil. The seafood is fresher, and the sauce is better. I can actually taste flavour and not just tons of butter.

We ordered 1 lb of shrimps (cajun sauce), 1 lb of mussels (good catch blend), and soft shell crab fried rice. Everything tasted very good, the shrimp still have the heads on it so if you like to suck the creamy stuff from the head then good for you. You will know it's fresh when the head juice is sweet! The fried rice was quite impressive, there's lots of crab in it. Regarding the sauce, I think I preferred the house blend a little more.

Service was great and the environment was cozy and comfortable. I would definitely come back again.

{"text":"Puts the Asian.. in Caj-sian.. get it?
Great sea food place and also good for lunch. 
Love their lunch menu Poke bowl.
Great place to hang out with a bunch of friends. Good selection of beer on tap as well!"}
{"text":"My partner and I came here last night in order to get some great seafood. I opened up yelp and saw they were open til 1am. We bundled up and faced the cold and made our trek down to Markham. 
There were a few booth that had patrons dining. As we waited at the door a young gentlemen in black shirt told us that the kitchen was closed and they already set out last call, but the bar is open. I took out my phone to see the time and it was exactly 11:49pm. At that point I looked at the guy like are you kidding me? Server looked like she didn't want to serve us either and gave us dirty looks.
We left. 
What could we do.
Disappointed because we ate here before.
We won't be coming back to this place and I suggest they change their business hours on yelp to 11:49pm."}
{"text":"The hype and reviews are fo real! This place is bomb! I am not a huge fan of seafood however this place speaks otherwise. 

Went with my family and we pretty much ordered everything that was the most popular items that most people ate. 

-Lobster roll with hot butter was amazing! Lots of flavor and the lobster meat was delicious! 
-Softshell crab sandwich was really tasty as well. Soft crab meat and not overly fried 
-The oyster slider! Super tasty! Probably one the best tasting sliders I've eaten that wasn't beef. 
- The cajun bag shrimps! Yum yum! loaded with flavor since its marinated in the sauce so the shrimps really soak up the juices. 

Also got the wings which were decent! The wings were larger than what I expected and bigger in size than usual places imo. 

Really enjoyed this place for their seafood! Definitely would come again and eat the same things since it was so good! The only thing that I could say that they could improve on is that, the bag shrimp could be less salty. I felt really thirsty afterwards but its probably a mixture of everything I had eaten. Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night after work to satisfy my seafood craving. The server was fairly nice and polite as we sat down to reccomend us some beers. The place got a bit busy but not too packed however it was sad to see that they made two mistakes during our sitting. From bringing our drinks to the wrong table to forgetting an order we made and having 2 servers come back and confirm what we ordered - the first server wrote everything down too, so I don't know what happened! 

The food however was lovely as my dad and I enjoyed the boiled lobster with the cajun seasoning the most, the soft shell crab and cajun fries. The boiled shrimp was not as succulent as the lobster as the seasoning didn't quite marinate into the meat. Over all place was pretty good. Was just a shame to have somewhat unprofessional service."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but I didn't really enjoy the experience. There were more misses than hits in our dinner experience. We got the hot lobster roll, the oyster basket, and a bag of clams in the good catch sauce. 
The lobster roll was okay..... lobster was fine but it was drowing in butter. Like overloaded with it and the bread was not robust enough so it was just soggy and oily. Yuck. 
The bag of clams were okay as well. The clams were smaller than some other places I have been to and the good catch sauce was okay. Not much flavour in my opinion. 
Oyster basket is good and tasty and fries had excellent flavour and was crispy. Of the three, this was our fave. 
Maybe I didn't order the right things or maybe this was an off day but my experience left me disappointed especially after seeing so many good reviews."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place had a fantastic boil. I have the schedule on muscles. They were excellent."}
{"text":"Would give this 3.5 for food but our party of 7 sat for quite some time and they didn't give us any rude comments or tried to push us out.

We got the lobster nachos, 2 lbs each of the shrimps, mussels, and clams. Also got the soft shell crab rice and fish and chips.

Lobster nachos wasn't too special. Wasn't worth the price. The garlic sauce was my favourite and curry least. I've had better fish and chips and soft shell crab rice.

All in all this place is huge, good for meet ups and to watch a game. Also the decor is very nice.

After tax and tips and mind you we shared all that it was $27 per person. The damage wasn't that bad. Would come again with a huge party as it's fun and they have the space to accommodate."}
{"text":"What a nice treat for a quick to go lunch today. I grabbed the Salmon poke bowl with Sushi rice and grapefruit sauce. It was delicious and healthy.  Crunchy, sweet, warm, cool and savory. I expect to be a repeat customer.

The restaurant itself was bright, clean and not too busy on a wet Thursday at lunch. The server that helped me was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend and her friend for our anniversary with no expectations, definitely was blown away. Great meal , great atmosphere and friendly staff. Our server Jen was very helpful and informative,  great selection of oyster and the wine selection was great. We had 20 oysters and they were all perfectly chucked which is rare to see, and all the food came out in a timely manner and was very well balanced in seasoning. I'm a veteran of the industry and I would easily say that good catch is definitely a restaurant that you need to check out if your in the unionville area or even plan a drive up there since parking is definitely not issue. I definitely will be back to try more of the menu and have more oysters and drinks. Thanks good catch team for an amazing night."}
{"text":"I have seen mixed reviews on Yelp of this restaurant...and here is mine.

I have been to this place twice. My friend and I have prefer to have early dinners to avoid the dinner rush...especially weekends, and so both times, we came just when it opens for dinner. Nice and quiet.

First impression was great, fun decor and the hostess were friendly. Servers were good, they told us of the specials, what's fresh etc...and gave us time to review our menus....took our orders, if there were things they weren't sure of, they'd check. I appreciate that gesture. The only thing is that it takes them longer to refill water. I do understand that beverages make the most $$ but I love my water, I'd rather spend my $$ on food, that's just me.

Food...we have tried crab legs, mussels, clams-with different sauces, their oyster basket, and their lobster bisque...
Cajun - it was to the salty side for my liking, I'd prefer their \"good catch\" sauce- in which I think also contains cajun + a bit of each
Butter + garlic- compliments the seafood, I added lemon juice for a little acid
Oyster basket- bite sized oysters, crunchy, and fries were crispy- I like it
Lobster bisque-well, the flavour is there, but it was served in a paper take out cup and by the time I got around trying other items, it got cold. For me, I ordered it because of curiosity---I know I'd appreciate it more if I get to enjoy it in a more relaxed setting, with proper soup bowl and silver spoon-and no greasy hands-after all, there is a lot of work behind the making of this bowl of soup

Overall- I enjoyed my meals here, it is fun to go with a group of friends"}
{"text":"Excellent seafood boil restaurant located conveniently in downtown Markham! The restaurant is massive, with a full selection of craft beers, lots of seating (they can accommodate big groups), booths, and TVs for sport fans. The menu covers both the seafood boil selection and a variety of other dishes such as fries, lobster sandwich, and fried rice. I've been twice and have been satisfied both times. Highly recommend their signature sauce for the seafood."}
{"text":"The best seafood I ever had starting with the oyster sliders melts I  your mouth and the shrimp with the good catch blend the service was excellent when we ordered one shrimp woth just schezuan we told the waitress it was too spicy and she happily took it back and made it less spicy I will definetly come back here and try the other excellent items on the menu"}
{"text":"Came on a weekday for dinner and it was not packed at all. With Good Catch, I really like the ambience in this restaurant as the ceilings are high and it feels spacious (unlike Captain Boil). 

For our party, we ordered: 4 pounds of mussels (in garlic butter, good catch blend, lemon pepper, cajun),1 pound of mussels (in garlic butter), lobster bisque, fried oysters and cajun fries.  

Honestly, I think the mussels are the best value for the seafood boil that they served. The clams tasted alright but sometimes there was no meat in the shells. The seafood boils were not super marinated but it definitely had more flavour than other seafood boils in Toronto. However, you can always ask for more sauce to drench the seafood in. I didn't really have a favourite in terms of the flavouring. They were all alright across the board. 

The fried oysters were probably the best part of this meal (definitely recommend this dish) as the flavour and texture were on point. 

The lobster bisque was disgusting as it did not even taste like how lobster bisque should be. It is as if they randomly dumped some lobster meat into some random soup base and made a soup. 

The cajun fries were crispy and tasty (definitely recommend this dish as well). 

This would be a good place to host parties/events as they have many large tables catering to large parties. I would probably come back to Good Catch again as the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Enjoyed the Cajun rice; however, those who do not like spice or very much heat stay away from this dish. The garlic muscles, I could have eating that all night long! 

Great spot to hang with friends, and not have a care in the world if sauce is on your face or dripping on your hands. 

Loved that they had multiple big screens throughout the restaurant, volume wasn't too loud or too low. Was able to watch the playoffs and still hold a conversation.

Ultimately a pretty good hand out seafood spot for all the seafood lovers! I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"I love seafood-in-a-bag! Yummy seafood cooked and served in bags of delicious marinades! Yes, this is another boil restaurant, but so far I like this one the most. Good Catch is very spacious, the food is good, and when I got home my clothes didn't have the usual smell from boil restaurants. Yay! We ordered lots from the menu and the best for me were the king crab legs cooked with their house marinade. Very tender and juicy! Everything in their fried baskets was also great. They were still in a soft opening when went so no alcohol, no raw bar, and no desserts. Also a few glitches here and there, but the staff was great and gave us a discount. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on Saturday night. Entrance to the restaurant is from the outside, on Enterprise Ave. The restaurant is very spacious with high ceilings. Sport games were playing and the atmosphere is pretty good. The restaurant is also kids friendly, they offer crayons for your kids to draw on the table to keep them entertained.

Our server was really friendly, she explained the menu to us and recommended the Oyster sliders in addition to the  seafood options. We ended up ordering the oyster sliders (which are 3 mini fried oyster burgers), a pound of snow crab legs in garlic butter sauce and a pound of mussels in the good catch sauce. The seafood tasted really fresh and of good quality. Overall, I had a really enjoyable meal.

The restaurant is under soft-opening right now as their raw oyster bar is not opened yet. I will definitely return. This will likely be a new go-to sports bar in Markham, especially if they can maintain their quality! Seafood and drinks, what's not to like!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. 
We were recommended kusshi oysters and we weren't disappointed! We also ordered a lobster and mussels. Both were delicious and well flavoured."}
{"text":"Datenight with my husband and enjoyed the place. Good ambience and warm staff. We started with fresh oyster from PEI which are exceptionally sweet. Ordered oyster sliders, soft shell crab, 2lbs shrimp with little spicy good catch sauce and 1 lb mussels in butter garlic. Everything were really good and tasty. What I love about this place is they offer more options compare to other boiled seafood places."}
{"text":"For the price you get a decent amount of seafood. There is a good selection of sauces to choose from as well. 

I highly recommend getting the shrimp in the good catch house blend sauce and adding Brussel Sprouts. The soft shell crab was also very delicious. 

I however did not very much enjoy the slaw and felt that it wasn't worth the high price point."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant for a nice lunch on a beautiful sunny day with some friends today. Bring on the spring weather!!

Ordered soft shelled crab sandwich with Cajun fries on the side. A simple sandwich, with soft bread, mango salsa and basic condiment mayo adds flavour and texture. It doesn't really compete with the soft shelled crab, but I was hoping the batter on the crab would be more seasoned and crispier. 

The Cajun skinny fries were good! A tad heavy handed on the salt but still nice and crunchy. Cruelly kind of addictive too... I wanted more... 

There's just enough contrast with the caesar salad and mango salsa with the sandwich to balance the flavours out. Since the dish was fried and I knew it was going to be a bit greasy, I requested for a cup of hot water and lemon on the side. That was nice way to end the meal. Super refreshing!

Nothing too complicated on the menu. 
We like seafood and the menu looked good. We haven't been to this before - (suggestion through a friend) and this was a nice choice. The environment was warm and decor is fun."}
{"text":"I've visited twice, once during the first few weeks of opening and the second time in mid-July. The service is okay, a little bit sparse at times when it's busy but otherwise fine. The decor is interesting and the theme is very fun. 

The general theme was the food being overly salty and excessive garlic in every bag of boiled seafood we had. We ordered dungeness crab which was alright, wouldn't get this again. We were told that there was no craw fish available well after our server had taken our order (not sure if this is because the server was very new or the kitchen had run out without informing the servers). We ordered several bags of shrimp both times and was really happy with how fresh they were and how they were a very decent size. The clams were not the best choice, they weren't particularly tasty and they were also very tiny. The soft shell crab basket was okay but nothing special, definitely not the best soft shell crab we've eaten. We got a separate order of cajun fries and were pretty disappointed with the tiny portion for the cost. The worst item we ate has to be the fried calamari which consisted of more tiny pieces of fried batter than whole pieces of calamari rings. They were overcooked and chewy, and very very greasy. 

I would visit again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't say that this would be my first choice to have seafood boil."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best nacho plates I've had with lobster. They aren't stingy on the lobster and so much flavour. The atmosphere is casual but welcoming and every one is friendly. We had the oyster sliders which were really good and it's reasonably priced. We frequently go here."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a Yelp Elite event and it has been on my mind ever since.. so I had to come back!

The restaurant has tons of seating, good natural lighting as it is in a corner unit with tons of windows. Large screen TVs all around with very cute décor. Upon entering there is an amazing garlic aroma.. lol. The staff are all very friendly and we were constantly checked up on.

We ordered 1lb of mussels, oyster sliders, Cajun seafood fried rice and soft shell crab fried rice. All of the food was delicious.

I did notice that some of the items on the menu are quite expensive though (ie. lobster nachos for $30?! lobster roll for $22?!)."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends (6 people in total) this week, and it was surprisingly very good. We ordered 3lbs clams, 1lb shrimp,  3lbs mussels, 2 portions of oyster sliders, and lobster nacho. We split the cost and it only came out to be about $27 each! In my opinion there were more selections and price is more reasonable than Captain's Boil. I'm not a huge fan of spicy food, but I found their Medium spice level to be very good. However, although Mad spice level was a bit too spicy for me, I was still able to enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do, don't order the poke here. It was probably the worst I have ever had. I ordered the salmon poke, the fish portions and sauce was very minimal. Even with the sauce and toppings, it tasted very bland. I understand poke is a new option on the menu but it was very disappointing! Next time I'm here, I'll be sure to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"Been there twice now and both times, the service was friendly and pleasant. The environment is quite nice, clean and spacious. The food was good, considering I've never had an experience from a southern seafood type of restaurant. Food is not as salty as people make it seem to be (from other reviews) but, I must say that their garlic butter option is just \"meh\". Their house sauce/flavour is much better."}
{"text":"This is the third time I came here and every time I was very satisfied. The staff have always been friendly and helpful. We have always been happy with the portions and taste of the food. The sauce the clams and shrimp are cooked in is so tasty that it's tempting to drink it. They also have a good variety of beer to choose from ( I took the flight to sample a variety). Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience at Good Catch. The ability to mix and match flavours with each order is fantastic. Server was friendly and attentive. The owner actually came over and talk to our table even though the restaurant was full which was a nice touch. One of the choice of flavours has Okra which was delicious. I went with a large group so we got to try all the flavours... not a bad one in the bunch."}
{"text":"Second time here, first was when they first opened, I enjoyed it! Months later revisited, not the same at all. No one came to our table for about 15mins to ask if we wanted something to drink.  I understand we were waiting for other people to arrive but still maybe we would like a drink while we wait? 
It was busy and servers were standing behind us at their serving station, eating food, on their phones and having very loud conversations, that included many bad words. We had 3 young children in our party right in ear shot, many mentions of the F word. 
2 of our orders didn't get ordered, which made for a wait on some people's orders.. All 3 Dungeness crabs that were ordered had 1 Claw missing on each one.. why cheap out? Your telling your customers  it's a \"Whole Crab\" for $40 you think you get the whole thing.. And that all the crabs would be within the same size range if your charging the same price for each one of them. One big, 2 super small. 
We had Marinas Top Drawer oysters, not so fresh, foul odour.. the beau soliel seemed fresh. Their red vinegar sauce for the oysters was black.. I'm pretty sure it's suppose to be red, I've eaten it at many other places. Must be very very old!
Salt shakers and Tabasco bottles are nasty, I know it's a messy environment cause you eat with your hands, but gezzzz wipe down your nasty salt shaker, it's embarrassing. 
Fried calamari gets a 1 star, small little tiny bits, where do you find your squid? Rings are the size of a small child's pinky ring. 

Would I return here for a third time, no probably not. Everything seems it's frozen, except the bagged dungeness crab and lobster... 
We tried pretty much EVERY item on the menu. Everyone was pretty disappointed. 
I'm pretty sure soft shell crab season is long over."}
{"text":"I'll have to confess that I initially didn't want to dine here, but glad to say I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed the experience! The soft shell crab, fries, and oyster sliders were delicious. We also had the snow crab legs, shrimps and mussels with assorted flavours, very fun to eat! In the end, we ordered rice to eat with the leftover seafood and sauce. Would recommend! The only negative thing was that it took forever to get a server to bring us our bill."}
{"text":"Ordered the lobster roll which came with salad and fries. It was $22 and I decided to upgrade to sweet potato fries for an extra dollar. Honestly I felt the price was quite high already considering the sandwich was kinda small. The good thing was there was a nice amount of lobster in the sandwich. I picked the cold version with mayo but next time will try the butter. Pretty tasty! The salad (very little) that came with the meal seemed as though it had been sitting in caesar dressing for a few hours so it wasn't too fresh. But I definitely liked the sweet potato fries. Wish there was more. 

Service was quick! We were in and out in 30 - 40 mins. Of course, it helped we came on a Monday weeknight around 9-ish so it was almost empty. 

10% off final bill if you check in using Yelp. But this might only apply until early April I believe. 

We will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Best to come here for lunch when they have their poke bowl options! Salmon or tuna poke for $12.99 is very fresh and tasty with a mix of other ingredients like avocado, corn, garlic chips, and chopped vegetables. Even better is to come weekend of lunch when their raw bar is open as soon as the store opens. Got a dozen cherrystone clams which tasted so fresh! The soft shell crab sandwich was also very good - the mango chutney went surprisingly well with the sandwich. Have to try the oyster sliders next time!"}
{"text":"A solid 4.5 star (would have given that if Yelp uses 0.5 star increments)

I ordered soft shell crab sandwich. Not only did it come with Cajun fries (as stated in the menu), but it also came with salad. Food is delicious and the soft shell crab is also quite large. The portion size is well worth $12.99. The seating is spacious and has plenty of big screen TVs for it to be a sports bar.

The reason it's not getting 5 star is because they didn't hire enough waiter. Or put in another way, they did not assign the right number of staff to front of house. I was there on Saturday at about 12pm and there were 3 ladies who are serving customers front of house and 3 guys helping with the seafood bar. The ladies were clearly overworked and it took them over 10 mins after I asked them to refill my glass of water. Meanwhile, the guys are not doing much at the seafood bar and could definitely have helped with simple tasks like refilling water. Better training or instructions by the manager could improve the quality of service"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was pretty empty, the food did take some time to come but the service was pretty good. I ordered the salmon poke bowl and my friend ordered the tuna poke bowl. These dishes were on the lunch special, which was a reason we got it and we wanted to be healthy for once!

They were pretty decent poke bowls, but nothing special. The interior was very modern and clean and the place is pretty massive, but I can see the restaurant filling up during dinner times and on weekends.

This place is located in Downtown Markham as well."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch today and found the restaurant quite delightful. 
The food was very reasonably priced and tasted delicious, the atmosphere was very relaxed.
We were seated immediately, our server was pleasant, I questioned her about the menu she answered very politely and was helpful. 
I will definitely be visiting next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Good - lots of craft beer
Bad - poor food quality. Boil seafood: not much taste, lobster roll (hot): too buttery, soft shell crab sandwich: batter is too thick, chicken tender strip: mushy chicken, Caesar salad: watery and overdressed you can tell it was premixed, fries: too soft"}
{"text":"Nice modern interior. Not too many people here on Thursday evening. Service is prompt and servers seem to know what they're doing. Food is not bad, though I probably won't order fresh oysters again. I would say that this place is more about having a seafood addittion to your beer rather than a family restaurant. In this function it serves its purpose well."}
{"text":"Two occasions - I have waited to write this review. I was here on Good Friday and for the Yelp Gta Elite Event on Monday and both occasions I have been very please with the overall experience. 

Good Friday 

I had messaged the establishment via facebook to see if they were open on that day and I received a prompt reply which I really appreciated. Especially since they were not open until 5:00pm and I had messaged at probably 9:00am which was great because then I could continue planning my day.

Took us a little bit to find the restaurant, had to walk around the entire \"Mall\". However that worked out because le boyfriend was no as hungry as I was so I definitely made him work for it! We got there and were greeted right away - even to my surprise they had seated us right after.  It was insane though after we had sat down and placed our order because it became SUPER busy. 

The waitress was really delightful and knowledgeable. I had asked her for recommendations and we definitely ordered based on that. Lobster bisque, lobster roll (with caesar salad and fries) HOT, soft shell crab (with fries) and shrimp in garlic butter. 

The only thing I would say is that the soft shell crab because it is deep fried had oil pockets which I was not exactly excited about however still indulged.

#YelpsGoodCatch Event

The only thing would be the oyster sliders again just like the soft shell crab had oil pockets and its only on my personal preference that it is not for me today. However overall everything was amazing,

I will DEFINITELY be recommending this establishment to EVERYONE =)"}
{"text":"It's like a sports bar but with not just wings and beer.  Their sauces flavour is not too heavy but taste good. The lobster nacho is good for pictures but doesn't taste as good.  The nachos get soggy and not much lobster in there."}
{"text":"1) The service we had wasn't very good.
We waited awhile to order our food since it was so busy. Our server was nowhere to be found as we hailed a another waiter who had to look for her. We had no water until half way done our meal. This is the second time we've been here.


2) The pound of shrimp we ordered wasn't fresh. 
It was on the verge of going bad, it was squishy when you bite into it. I've ate at capt's boil a number of times. Fresh shrimp is always firm. Capt's boil definitely is best if you're looking for the seafood bag experience.

3) Oyster slides were good. I'd definitely recommend this dish if you are going to come here."}
{"text":"I went in for my book club.  They had a rib fest going on so it may be why it was very little people have a meal.   

Food:  
You order and the food arrives as it is ready.   It not bad.   The temp is great very hot!    The only down side is if your with a group not everyone  is not eating together.   

Drinks 
I had ice tea and I had 3 refills and they charged each time.   I don't think that is far or right.   Why did they say that when I order.  I did find I had to flag the host down to get a drink refill for the table.  

Over all good but stick to water they don't change for that..   
would I go back no"}
{"text":"This restaurant was nothing like I have tried before. I came here for a team bonding event, and absolutely loved the concept. It was messy, fun, and altogether a good time. Definitely more fun with a group of people, but I recommend trying something like this at least once. The seafood was very well priced, and I ordered the calamari/lobster nachos for starters, and the 1LB bag of mussels for dinner, which were flavorful and delicious. It was also fair priced for the amount of food you get (the mussels were only $10-$12, and I couldn't even finish them). Don't come here if you're looking for a fancy, clean, sit down meal, because this is just the opposite! I'll definitely bring family here in the near future."}
{"text":"Pretty good for the price. We went to the boil house during happy hour. Food was good but service was lacking. To be honest, I don't even know who our server was because they rarely came to our table. Luckily the different servers helped out and brought us water and condiments. 

We got the mussels and chicken wings off the happy hour menu and the oyster sliders off the regular menu. The oyster sliders were definitely the star of the show. The oysters were perfectly fried and the mayo sauce and toasted buns knocked it out of the park. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience and really good cheat food especially after GoodLife. I would return and most likely will try dinner at this boil house. Parking is a bit of a drag though in downtown Markham, so be prepared to fight for a spot."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday and I ordered the same thing as before. I think the owner is trying to cut costs because the food went down hill a lot.

I ordered the clams with the mixed sauce along with sausage and brussel sprouts. There was barely any sauce and they charge you for extra sauce now, which is ridiculous. Also, the sausages are no longer regular sauces, they're sweet. Gross.

Waitress also failed to mention that drinks were cheaper after 9 but told my friend after. So, I got a drink at 8:45 and paid twice as much when he showed up at 9 and paid half price."}
{"text":"The hardest places to write reviews of are the really good ones. We've been eyeing this place for a bit but was hesitant because of the mediocre reviews. Our friends' high recommendations finally pushed us over the edge and made the plunge. 

Now off to the juicy part of the reviews : the food - A M A Z I N G! The name Good Catch is a humble description of the food they serve. The Oysters are a must sample. We ordered two of each category ( our server patiently explained to us to which we were very grateful). It came with 2 kinds of sauces. I preferred the one with the fruity flavor, it sounds weird now but you will understand once the fruity notes of the brine touches the oyster and brings out the sweetness you taste from its freshness. We had the privilege of trying several on our second visit.  Everything was delicious. From our palates you can tell how well thought each dish was . rolled off our tongues (and into our bellies) like a synchronized swim dance with matching light shows.  . Start off with chicken wings glazed with Honey Garlic which tastes as good as it sounds (trust me its not one of those you taste elsewhere, this is THE Real Deal!). then the Good Catch Slaw (MUST TRY, no joke)I'm not a big Salad Fan and I'd try to talk you into ordering this but then I won't because I want you to try for yourself so you'd believe what I was going crazy about. We had the Good Catch sauce on our shrimps which was a good combination of flavour. The Garlic Mussel was just as good that we spooned the sauce to our Spicy Seafood Fried rice using the Mussel shell (you say barbaric I say artistic )  By the time we hit the Oyster Sliders  we were on natural seafood high. My partner in seafood crime had miraculously thought of claiming fullness until his first bite of the oyster sliders. We agreed to share one sandwhich and bag the other two but alas we couldn't resist - there was no Oyster Sandwich that made it to the brown bag. 


We had discovered a few errors : 1.) we doubted a place because of some mixed reviews  2.) we ordered a mild cajun boil house. We love some heat but forgot that Cajun was heated (by nature) but still we enjoyed and would definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I am so excited about this restaurant! 

We had a reservation for 6 people at 8pm and we were seated within 5 minutes or so of the reservation. The restaurant is big and spacious but they managed to fit in a lot of seating. It's a great space and it's decorated nicely. It has a sports bar, mixed with a seafood restaurant/gastropub feel. 

All of the menu looks amazing, everyone was so excited to order and it was so hard to decide what we wanted. The prices are quite reasonable, considering the value, area and atmosphere. 

We decided on a few appetizers, the lobster nachos, oyster sliders and a dozen raspberry point oysters. The nachos were AMAZING, nice big chunks of lobster, a generous portion of chips, guacamole, sour cream, cheese and all the usual nacho toppings. I don't think I can ever eat regular nachos again! The oyster sliders were also amazing, the oysters tasted fresh and the breading was light, they dressed it with some type of sauce and some fried onion strings and it was really fantastic. This portion was really good for the price of around $13. The fresh oysters were also delicious, they were large and meaty, they came with horseradish, seafood sauce, lemon wedges and some other garlic looking sauce. 

After the appetizers we ordered the crawfish with the good catch sauce, a lobster roll, Dungeness crab, the chicken strips and the fried soft shell crab with sweet potato fries. The crawfish was a massive portion, I think there were 20 crawfish in each bag, they tasted fresh and the sauce was really good, mind you the medium sauce is quite spicy! We added potatoes and corn which really makes this into a meal. A friend got the Dungeness crab which looked really good and the lobster roll looked good as well, unfortunately I didn't get around to trying them, my friends enjoyed these dishes however. 

The service was pretty good, I think the servers are still quite new so they would have to go to the kitchen to ask questions if they didn't know something, for example what types of sauces did they have for the chicken strips or how many does it come with. But overall she was friendly and attentive. 

I really hope this restaurants keeps up the good work and can continue to offer the consistent value and flavour. I can't wait to come back to try the shrimp and other dishes! 

Also a bonus, they're open until 2am so you can stop in even after a late movie for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times now I know the staff! It's a great place to go for my seafood fix and if you really are in the mood to get'yer hands messy.  

Lobster nachos are good and I usually get the lobster boil with the captain's sauce.  

They have deep fried oysters which is great if you're in the mood to cheat eat a bit."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Everything was delicious from the shrimp to the lobster roll. Great atmosphere and the whole family really enjoyed the experience. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is the second boil seafood place ive been to. And i am impressed with the variety of food they have in the menu other than the boiled seafood in a bag. Didnt order it this time but i for sure will give them a try next time. 
Got the lobster, calms, mussels, and shrimp. Plus a dozen oysters cuz i sat right in front of the oyster bar, how can i resist. They have a  good variety of oysters from both east and west coast. Fresh and yummy! 
Got the good catch blend for shrimp and mussels. Garlic butter for calms and lemon pepper for the lobster. The lobster was reli small. And the sauce wasnt that impressive, no lemon no pepper flavour lol the good catch blend was the best choice, but one of my frds cant eat spicy, so idk if thats why I felt like something was missing. I got hot sauce on the side. But still, different."}
{"text":"First time coming here and ohmy I wish I knew about this place sooner. Seafood is my favourite type of food and this place does it so well.

The location of the place was great, there were a bunch of other food places, a cineplex, and I believe a mall in the area. There was also lots of parking and an underground parking. 

The interior inside was colorful with a hint of rustic vibe. They have a giant TV screen which would be great for a sports night out with friends. 

I got the Combo E ( 1¼lb lobster + 1lb clams + corn + potatoes) in the good catch blend sauce that had the cajun/lemon pepper/garlic sauce. It was amazing! A tiny bit spicy even with mild but it was the perfect mix. We also got the lobster roll in a hot butter sauce, it came with Cajun fries and a salad, everything was so yummy and I wanted more. 

It can be a bit pricey, but it was worth it for all the seafood we got. I will definitely be coming back here to try the other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Celebrated our friend's birthday here tonight for dinner.  No problem this time with our reservations.  

We got 2 lbs of the shrimps in the Good Catch Blend and the Garlic Butter flavours.  Coming here for the 3rd time, I can conclude that the shrimps are truly my favourite.  It's really fresh and tasty.   The sauces are also really good.  We added corn and okra to the mix which was a good side to go with the shrimps.  The soft shell crab rice was a little hard but it was still pretty good.  And the Good Catch Slaw is definitely a must if you come here.

The service was great and our server was very attentive refilling our water.

Overall, we had a great time and it's back on our list of places to go to when we are here to watch a movie at the Markham Cineplex theatre."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located on Enterprise Blvd and Birchmount Rd. The location is convenient because it's right beside Cineplex Cinemas Markham and VIP. On the other hand, I had trouble finding a spot because dinner + movies was such a popular activity-of-choice on Saturday nights. Try parking underground, and be prepared to walk a bit to get to the front entrance. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
The hostess was very friendly, our server checked up on us quite often and was courteous enough let us know that the chef  took a little longer than expected to prep our food. 

[DÉCOR] - 5/5 
Bright, modern, but still kept the marine-theme with the ocean-blue booths and fisherman-esque décor. I also had fun eating with my hands, relax, and enjoy a casual dinner.

[QUALITY] - 4/5
The lobster tasted pretty fresh, nachos were crispy, and melted cheese was creamy. 

[ORDER] - 5/5
- Nachos (Add Lobster) - $29.95: Nachos were $14.95 and I decided to add lobster for $15.00, which was definitely a good deal! The dish had colourful nacho chips, topped ooey-gooey cheese, jalapeno peppers for some acidity, and nachos and cream cheese dip on the side. The portion was so huge, and I would definitely recommend this to share with your friends. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
The lobster nachos were amazing, but I personally don't think their seafood by the pound is worth the price if you're extra hungry. I do recommend pairing the seafood their sides or sharing the lobster nachos with multiple people. Overall, Good Catch Boil House is a great place for a casual night-out, and some good-quality seafood."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Grand Catch Boil and it was very good. We had excellent service and excellent food. The mussel and shrimp combo was great. Medium heat and I had their combo flavor! Thank you"}
{"text":"This is a newer opened restaurant that way under estimated its popularity for Father's Day 2017. I booked a table of 4 for Sunday lunch and the hostess over the phone told me not to worry it shouldn't be that busy but I insisted making it earlier that week. This place got slammed from open at 11:30am and line ups spilling outside still around 2pm! Needless to say the service suffered from being understaffed. The manager was helping out and he looked tense! I'm always empathetic to servers as I have been one myself, but it's rough when you can't flag anyone down for water for 15 mins, or check on your table. 

Food: 4.5 stars
Service today: 2.5 
Washrooms: 3 (ran out of soap & paper towels already at opening??) 

Ordered:
The Yelp: lobster fries supreme
Tuna poke bowl Cajun sauced
2 Bags of mussels 
Sweet potatoe fries 
Sampler beer flight($11!)

Gotta say all the food was top notch 5 stars like at the Yelp tasting this year...except for the Yelp order! It was not what I thought Yelp inspired meant. How did that go wrong?
The fries were piled on a 6 inch plate, so that's very small, drowned in a cheese sauce and sour cream that was way too salty and lacking flavor profile, missing bacon or I couldn't find them with bits of lobster that probably amounted to a tablespoon and dusted with Cajun spice. This is a pass, save room for the boiled seafood.
Beer selection is great here, if unsure order the flight to sample 4 from the menu. 

I will visit again and hopefully they'll be better staffed"}
{"text":"It was okay...

Huge restaurant. Lots of people. Very lively. And staff running around all the time. Just to give you an idea of what it's like here. FYI this restaurant cannot be accessed (not now anyways) through the inside, so make sure you get a good parking spot, especially when the weather isn't that great.

The restaurant is quite large, and there's plenty of seating available. The decor (including the famous golden Popeye right at the front door) is pretty cool; very colourful and vibrant. The staff are pretty much running around all the time. The food does come pretty quick, which is a bonus.

Now, a low down on the food. Most of them were okay, but not amazing. Seafood, imo, is best served fresh and not deep fried, not to say that it wasn't good here, though. It's a different kind of enjoyment. The majority of their menu here are deep fried, which is pretty good if you're watching a game on their multiple tv's here. They do provide gloves for eating so it's the same concept for all boil houses out there. We ordered a few pounds of various seafood and it was a good amount among 8 people. They also have a selection of oysters, which we didn't try. My favourite dish here was probably the nachos. There's lots of ingredients there, and large enough to share among a few people. Another dish is their sliders. Perfect size to eat in a few bites, and cute enough for some IG moments.

Price is pretty decent, not much to argue there. The atmosphere is pretty fun to come with a group to chill and eat."}
{"text":"I gave two star only because the service wasn't too bad. The food was just terrible. The house special sauce was nothing but salty. We had stomachache afterwards."}
{"text":"Captain's boil is still better! .  I had the lobster roll with salad and fries and it was just okay. Maybe I'll change my mind when I come next time to try the seafood boil! Your lobster roll would taste better with a hint of sea salt, pepper and  . And your skinny fries is just over fried, I had difficulty eating it so a bit disappointed. The service is great and really love the set up !"}
{"text":"Can't complain to be honest. The downside is that this type of restaurant trend is going down and they opened it a bit too late. Their food is great and at a competitive price. I love the atmosphere and feel of the place! I will totally go back again over captains boil."}
{"text":"There's been so many Captain Boils opening that made me have a sudden crave to have some seafood in a bag, but figured I'd try a new place instead.

Shrimp ($12.95 per pound)
Ordered 1 lb of shrimp in the Good Catch Boil's sauce, which was supposed to be a mix of Cajun and lemon pepper. We asked for medium spicy level, which wasn't that spicy. The sauce wasn't as flavorful as I expected it to be, not sure if they just didn't add enough? It's also cause after you peel off the shrimp shells, the shrimp doesn't have much flavor and you need to redip the shrimp in the sauce but they didn't give enough and we had to ask for a side bowl of extra sauce.
We also ordered a lb of mussels ($12.95), which were ok. The mussels were big so I'll give it that, but I thought they were overcooked and the meat was pretty chewy.

Soft shell crab fried rice ($13.95)
This was slightly disappointing. I thought the fried rice would be really flavorful, drenched in their house Good Catch boil's sauce, but nope - lacked in flavor. We had to add some of our side bowl of sauce to mix it in to add flavor. There were quite a lot of chunks of soft shell crab, but the only thing was I couldn't tell if it was actually crab pieces of just more of the batter, and one thing really sucked was the soft shell crab pieces were soggy and not crispy at all. I know it probably got soggy cause of the sauce, but still. I've had it at other places where they were able to sustain the crispiness. 

Service was good. I like how although you have one designated server serving your table, other servers initiate and are willing to help out if you want to ask for something. 
I saw pictures of the lobster roll which looked really good, would have tried it but it was super overpriced imo. $22.95 for just one lobster roll? I hope the full lobster is actually in there."}
{"text":"Fries Fries Fries! Love their cajun fries there...
I always order 1lb of mussels, shrimps, clams (garlic butter & GC blend) + FRIES when I come here..I've tried their fried oysters basket, oyster sliders, Cajun seafood fried rice...not a big fans of these; but guys, must order their fries!!"}
{"text":"Two star for the food?the serve ignore me at all?have no water at begin?and even not say hi when i enter the door?"}
{"text":"Went with a large group of people for a birthday. I've been to a different Seafood Boil before and pretty much the same concept. Order your seafood & sauce, they throw it in a bag and it comes out piping hot, ready to eat with your hands. Definitely a fun way to eat food if your not fussy about getting a little messy. I was impressed with the menu selection because they also had some nice appetizers, sandwiches, salads and a decent selection of beers (which you can also get a flight if you like to try different ones). 

I tried the fried Calamari & the Oyster Sliders. The calamari was good and the oyster sliders were REALLY delicious! For the mains I shared the mussels, clams and shrimps. Personally I really liked the mussels in the good-catch blend between the 3. 

The waitress was great! Very attentive and friendly, considering we were a big group of about 20 people. She knew the menu pretty well and was able to give good recommendations. All-in-all a good dinner with moderate- to little but more expensive prices depending on what you get."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend for dinner and it was crazy busy. Huge space with many seats available. Some of the foods we got:

- oyster sliders: a MUST try when visiting. Great crispy deep fried oysters with amazing sauce 
- mussels, shrinks, clams: great sauce and fresh seafood
- chicken wings with fries: these were okay, kind of dry 

What makes this place different from Captains Boil and other similar chains is their amazing bar. Extremely impressionable as the drinks list was extensive with so many options to choose from. What's also great is that there's a little description of the beers. Perfect for if you wanna try something new but don't know what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Good food and service is enough to speak for a restaurant, and the majority of my reviews revolve around these 2 essentials. I'll start off by saying that the food is good, the price is reasonable, but the service can be a die hard hit or miss. I've been here quite a few times, but after my last experience I'm never going to take a good server for granted again. In the GTA a good waitress is common, but once you get a bad one, you'll know.

If you've been to captains boil, it's pretty much the same thing, but I'd say I prefer good catch's sauce more. Ordering shrimp, mussels, clams, or crab you won't go wrong. The sauce is flavourful, you can control the heat, and it's delicious. The soft shell crab however, I wouldn't say is anything special. It tastes okay, but I wouldn't go looking for it again.

On our most recent visit, we ordered 2lbs of shrimp, mussels, and clams, a grapefruit radler and a liquid gold. When the food came, I thought it was unusually small, but didn't think anything of it. We finished it very quickly and ordered ANOTHER round of 2lbs of each. When the second order came again it looked really small so we asked the guy who brought it how much it was. 

Long story short the waitress got our order wrong twice. The first time I specifically told her 2lbs of each and then reconfirmed with her before she ran off to god knows where. When confronted with her mistake she said \"you told me mussels, clams and shrimp, and I reconfirmed with you\". Keep in mind it also took me 3 times to try and explain what the problem was, and when it finally got through her thick skull, not even so much as an apology. Just a \"what do you want me to do about it now?\". Never have I met such a ditzy, incompetent, and arrogant waitress. But if it's any consolation, she also forgot to order the liquid gold. How hard is it to enter things on an iPad?"}
{"text":"If you want to really taste your seafood this place is great! The price is reasonable compared to captains boil and what I love is that there is parking! Flavour is great and portions are pretty good. Btw they are a chain of congee queen so their soft shell crab fried rice is gone EXACT same as congee queen. Don't remember if they marked up the price. Their oyster basket was really good and the fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"My sister recommended this place. I've been to Captains Broil a couple of times at 2 different locations. But when I tried Good Catch I can see a significant difference in quality of food. Firstly they give you real cutlery!!! Captains Broil gives your plastic cutlery and plates. For the price they charge you would think they can invest in real cutlery! Both are comparable in price.  As soon as I walked into Good Catch the restaurant was huge but it was also packed with people. On weekends try to make reservations on weekdays I was told you don't have to. It's very modern the decor and open. My boyfriend and I had the oyster sliders and calamari for appetizer it was delicious. The oyster sliders were amazing! Then we had the lobster rolls, 2 lbs Of lobster, 2 lbs so shrimps, 1 lb of mussels, corn and steam rice. We got the good Catch sauce which was a blend of spices, garlic, butter and it was a bit spicy. Soooo good. The seafood was fresh! The shrimps and mussels were bigger than average. Lobster i would say is a bit pricey for the size but we both love lobster and had to order it. The lobster roll was stuffed with lobster so good. We ate so much there was no room for dessert. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"??????????????????boil???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Of all the Louisiana crawfish boil-type seafood joints popping up in the GTA, this is probably one of the better ones. My group ordered, and greatly enjoyed, several bags of mussels, clams, shrimp, in garlic and Cajun varieties of medium and \"Mad\" spice levels. The broth was extremely flavourful without being overly salty and overwhelming the flavours of the seafood. I particularly enjoyed Mad Cajun mussels and was pleasantly surprised how sweet and clean the shrimp tasted. We also ordered some oyster sliders (which were different and great), and lobster nachos (delicious, but overpriced in my eyes). We'll definitely come back when more items come back in season."}
{"text":"Pass by this place all the time, and had no idea how much I was missing out on! Good Catch is kind of a hybrid seafood joint and sports bar, both of which are always of interest to me.

FOOD:

Came here mostly for the Lobster Roll. It was a bit on the small-side, but had a surprising number of chunks of lobster meat. The cold version that I ordered, came in a mayo-based sauce as is quite common. They also offer a 'hot' version of this, which is dressed in a warm sauce. This dish was accompanied by a side of Cajun fries, which seemed as though they made fresh, as well as a small side of Caesar salad. The Soft-shell Crab Sandwich was also a bit on the small side, but again hit the spot - crispy on the outside, and garnished with a mango/onion mix. 

SERVICE:

Our server was quite enthusiastic, friendly, and eager to assist. Food came surprisingly fast, though it was a slower weekday evening. 

ATMOSPHERE:

I'm sure this place is already trending, as it's got a great vibe to it. Seems like a great place to dine, have a drink, or just watch the game. Did I mention that this place has a nice big screen? Also has a bunch of smaller screens by the bar to keep up with the sports.

VERDICT:

I will definitely be back for food, and to catch a game or two."}
{"text":"Omgggg! I've been waiting for a solid craft beer joint in Markham forever! Combined with an incredible food selection that is well curated and focused, I've been here multiple times since the soft soft open, and seen them grow towards their grand opening. Fully excited to see what these folks are capable of, the food is unique, well varied, with excellent service and quality."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Had the lobster roll with Caesar salad and Cajun fries. It was, sadly, all very average. The roll tasted like buttered toast with rubbery bits in it. Didn't taste much like lobster. Fries were meh. Salad was typical. I will come back and try other things but will pass on lobster roll. Quite exp and still hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"I'm a fan, that's for sure! Came here on a Saturday during happy hour (3p-6p, and after 9p). The venue is spacious, well-decorated, and had tons of televisions for watching sports. From the get-go, the service there was superb. Our server took the time to engage in small-talk, describe the menu, as well as give her recommendations on which flavors complimented which seafood the best. 

We ordered a combo with 1.25lbs Dungeness Crab, 1lbs of shrimp, 1 corn and 1 potato paired with curry. In addition, we ordered 1 lbs of mussels from the happy hour menu. The curry was very savory and absolutely mouthgasmic, not to mention that the price was reasonable as well ($48.95). The mussels ($9.95) were huge and very fresh, but I was not really a fan of the Cajun sauce it was paired with. My only gripe about the whole experience were the drinks that we ordered. The rum & coke + gin & tonic proportions seemed a bit off (too much alcohol). Yea, its great that we were getting more alcohol for the money, but the drinks definitely didn't taste good. 

Overall, my experience was amazing. I highly recommend this place due to their quality seafood, reasonable prices, and superb customer service."}
{"text":"Good:
1. Food - Usually the only good thing about seafood boil places are their bags of seafood.  This is the one exception where pretty much the entire menu is tasty.  Don't just go here for their bags, go for their wings, their truffle fries, their beer, their happy hour specials...

2. Beer - Great selection of craft beers.  Not used to seeing this type of selection from places away from downtown Toronto.

3. Atmosphere - Staff is always friendly, large TVs all around make this a great place to gather to watch sports.  Paired with what's on tap and you've got a pretty nice hangout.

Worth it?
Definitely! Would come back over and over again.  Sorry Captain's Boil but you've been outdone."}
{"text":"We went in for a large lunch after the movie.  Service was excellent and our order arrived quickly.  We tried the fried oysters, lobster Mac and cheese and the cold lobster rolls with a flying monkey craft beer.  Everything was very good,  the Mac and cheese was excellent served with 2 slices of garlic bread."}
{"text":"3.5 star

I have mixed feeling towards Good Catch Boil House. I love what they are bring to Markham. 

- The first and still the only Craft Beer Bar with 18 draft lines offerings OCB in Markham
- Raw Seafood Bar sourced by Patrick McMurray offering fresh oysters and shellfish
- Best Sport Bar with so many TVs that no matter where you seated, you will able to watch the game! 
- Chicken Wings! So good, probably the best in Markham!

Good Catch just have so much potential! Locating in Downtown Markham and I can even imagine how busy it will get in the future: the place to be. In fact, they are busy even now for weekends!

Menu still needs some work. I hope you like deep fried food which can be super oily. The Soft Shell Crab was one of the worse thing I have as it was drenched in oil and looked just so brown. I don't really like the heavy batter they use their oyster/fish/soft shell crab. Just a shame to cover up the freshness of seafood with over breaded and seasoned batter.

Lobster rolls are good. I won't say they are the best I ever have but at least compares to what they offers in Markham.

I am glad they working on lunch menu which offers more diversity and at least with some non deep fried options. I tried their Salmon Poke which was quite decent.

Service can be a hit or a miss depends on your servers and the time of the day during your visit. 

I definitely recommend coming here to catch a game or as a pre/after movie drink and snack. And hopefully you love drinking beers!"}
{"text":"As a seafood lover, this establishment has become one of my favourite places to \"eat like no one's watching.\" It is refreshing to enter such a spacious restaurant where you don't have to worry about waiting ESPECIALLY considering how busy it may be since they are located in the heart of downtown Markham. 

Good Catch has made a great effort to create an open layout restaurant that delivers a variety of delicious dishes accompanied by amazing side dishes that hit the spot. I recently went and ordered the mussels and lobster nachos. The lobster nachos are a bit pricey but the mussels are super tasty and a must try for my fellow mussel lovers. 

My friends and I received our orders within 10 minutes, so asides from great dishes, the Good Catch staff/service was fast, friendly, and on point! Good Catch is more on the pricey side, however, their menu has a wider selection filled with unique dishes that are a total treat to your tastebuds. 

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I came with 2 other friends, and i absolutely loved this place. Compared to captains boil, their sauces were much more flavourful without all the salt content. I loved how they had more selections for spice levels (Im a huge fan of spicy food), and suicide was what hit home for me; it was the exact amount of spicy I was craving for.  

We ordered 2lb of clams, 1 lb shrimps, and calamari with sides of corn. It was fairly filling, and extremely delicious. I would definitely come back to try their oyster sliders and king crab legs (they ran out on the day we came)."}
{"text":"Within a week we came twice with two groups of friends. We were excited by the mouth watering food. We ordered 3 combo seafood and 4 other dishes. All very delicious. Garlic bread delighted us too. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dining here with family or just hanging out with friends. They have better food and good ambience compare to the other restaurant that serve seafood in a bag. The portion of their serving is also a good amount for the price you pay. 

I ordered shrimp with garlic butter sauce along with corn and potato as well as the salad called Good Catch Slaw which is a special salad known in Singapore from Susur Lee's Restaurant. It is made of rice vermicelli, carrots, cucumber, taro root, some edible flowers with peanuts and apricot dressing. It was quite a rewarding salad. I will definitely order it everytime I come here."}
{"text":"Finally get into good catch on Monday night. Waitress that greeted us was awesome she also specified the selection that is offered tonight.ordered lobster roll with h/butter, snow crab legs with corn and chicken tenders. The craft beer from Waterloo grapefruit radler was a nice choice for fruity and sweet addicts.All I want to say is fantastic. Compare to Captain's boil, the price is more reasonable and personally thought it tasted better.Definitely gonna come back again!"}
{"text":"Delicious boils! And very impressed with the Asian fusion dishes also.  Service is great, the staff are all very friendly.  Great place to eat with a lot of different options.  The good catch blend is amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here after watching beauty and the beast.  I had their salad which was totally Delilah and a big salad at that.

If you love seafood then this is the place."}
{"text":"3.5 of 5, overall experience. 

What I had: Lobster Roll with Truffle Fries (upgrade)

One regular size toast (roughly 3 x 3 inch), fully loaded with lobster. And the bread was toasted with butter and spread with mayo. A very rich texture. 


Truffle fried is good too, slim cut and dressed with Truffle oil, also you can dip with their mayo. 

Taste wise, I could have rate it 4.2 out of 5, but the shell remained in the lobster was really a turn down. If you are not lucky enough or eating carefully, you may need to see you dentist tmr... lol

Plus, pop here is not refillable, but they only charge you 1 buck per glass, compared to $2.75-3.25 refillable in other wing places."}
{"text":"This restaurant is conveniently located in the Cinneplex theater complex. It's very spacious and nicely decorated, nice ambiance.  
Staff were friendly. I like how they have a hand washing station by the bar which is prefect for before or after our meal. 

Warning: the good catch blend medium is quite spicy. The sauce was garlicky, buttery, spicy and salty. I like putting this sauce on top of white rice.  Yum! (How Asian of me). Shrimps and mussles were both fresh and deliciously sauced.
Calamari was just ok, too breaded for my liking but it wasn't bad.
Good catch slaw was delicious; many ingredients in the salad; however it came with a high price tag of  $19 and it's not that large. Salad was good but price was too steep for just a vegetarian salad IMO."}
{"text":"I had a party of 5 Friday night, I rate this place 4/5.

 Let's start by the service 5/5 
Server was very friendly, give us good idea of what to share and what's good the over all experience great!

Food , 3.5/5 
 We order few extra to share,
Lobster nacho 3/5 it's a great presentation on the table to wow your mind but taste is just nacho with salsa / sour cream. I say the lobster is about 1/2lb. Price point is not too over priced is say a reasonable for the size and the amount. 
 
Shrimp mussels snow crab,
We had the \"good catch\" special. The taste was amazing maybe it just a little on the salty side but just little ... acceptable 4/5
 Snow crab with curry again the taste was there on the good said but it's abit on the high salty side. 4/5 make sure you order the garlic bread and noddles on the side to go along with the crab


Overall I've try the \"other\" place that serve similar style of food I highly recommend good catch over the other place especially coming from the price point. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Here's another winner this year for worst dinning experience of 2017. 

Horrible service, bad food, waste of time. I don't want to waste more breath on this. 

You are warned now."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorite but it was such a disappointment today. We got the king crab leg, shrimp, sausage and fried oyster. The shrimp was not fresh at all, they were super mushy. King crab leg was pretty good but I expected good quality paying $45 per lb. the sausage tasted very different than first time. It has the sweeter taste like the Taiwanese kind. Great customer service! Overall I wasn't too impressed this time"}
{"text":"Good catch is a gem in the Markham \"movie\" complex. With so many boils available in the area, the one thing that makes this place stand out is their live oyster bar and the happy hour. After 9pm, several craft beers are listed for $5 with other food items also being discounted (fried oysters, wings). Good catch is also great for watching the big game as they have plenty of tv's and a big projector in the far wall. Overall great experience  and will definately be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"Good Catch has been here for awhile now, but I'm finally taking the time to write them a good review. They are an amazing addition to the booming Markham food scene that I can easily recommend it to anyone that likes seafood. 

During a time not too long ago, seafood steamed in bags became a big fad and while Good Catch was not first on the scene, they have a business that is great and most important of all, tasty. They are open quite late and serve seafood in bags, fried seafood in various forms, and definitely a lot of great dishes for seafood lovers. They are also a large, well kept and modern venue which makes it a great place for watching big games/events such as McGregor vs. Mayweather. They also have happy hour everyday after 9pm with certain $5 drinks and a few dollars off dishes such as wings.  I usually get the 6 wings with honey garlic sauce, which actually fills me up and packs a punch! With all these great points, Good Catch is easily a hot spot and an easy place to go for a good food experience. Service is also always great, and the workers all seem to genuinely like each other and their jobs. 

My only -ish with the place is that as a non-seafood eater, I would love to see a slightly expanded menu for meat lovers, or even integrating some of their lunch menu options into dinner. Other than that, I highly recommend Good Catch!"}
{"text":"Was just over here meeting up with friend for lunch. It's right at downtown markham near markham VIP, at the front. My lunch pal had a poke bowl, fish mix with some brown rice and special sauce. It looks great! I order a soft shell crab and also avocado grill cheese, sounds really healthy, but damn that grill cheese is what I'm going to come back for. So simple and so delicious! With fries on the side, instant diet fail for me."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing, ordered the soft-shell crab sandwich for take out and its the best Ive had in Toronto! Crab fried perfectly with delicious mango salsa, cajun fries and Caesar salad all good!"}

My friend told me when she was there the last time, she ordered mussels which was a bit weird in the texture in her opinion.  So i decided to give it a try since i do like mussels.  Those super size mussels came served in a plastic bag.  Say what?!  Uh huh.  My friends certainly had a good laugh out of my surprise.  In all honesty i couldn't wrap my head around this concept so i asked for a plate.  The server gave me a little side plate so i had to request for a dinner plate.  The wine came and we began our tasting of the foods.  For me, the curry sauce was the saving grace for the otherwise chewy mussels.  Then the server came to clear the table and proceeded to take away my friend's unfinished wine glass.  We had to stop her.  My turn to laugh at my friend's reaction to her wine being almost taken away from her.  Lol"}
{"text":"I think I was just too hyped up to go to this place.  Sort of watching so many spoilers and just being disappointed at the movie when you actually see it.

I did come here on lunch hour so I tried their lunch specials and though mine poke ball was relatively good, I found it to be overpriced for what I got.

I took a bite of my wife's fish and chips and considering what we paid for, that one was extremely overpriced.

You may be full in the end but it is pretty much carbo loading.  Honestly not worth it."}
{"text":"So weird as I thought I already reviewed this place, but here we go again. In comparison to other restaurants of a similar nature, I can say that I enjoyed Good Catch more because the seafood in the plastic bags is not as salty. We ordered Shrimp, Clams, Lobster Nachos, Lobster Bisque and the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich for dinner.

The Lobster Nachos were good and had a fair amount of lobster bits; the pricing was reasonable. I was not a fan of the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich (seemed to be dripping oil) or the Lobster Bisque. The Lobster Bisque was good at first but needs to be consumed quickly while it's still hot. It is extremely, extremely salty once it cools down.

I think that the food was nothing special and I would not return for dinner. I would like to return for lunch to try their poke bowls."}
{"text":"The soft shell crab sandwich comes with a salad and fries which is a great deal at $12.99. However,  I was disappointed by the sandwich. Firstly, there wasn't much crab meat, it was a lot of batter. Secondly, I didn't like their batter (same batter on their fish and chips as well) - it was too oily and thin, causing it to break into little pieces, and didn't feel crispy when I bit into it. To further add onto the wetness of the oil, the strangely sweet corn on top of the crab was really mushy. It would be better if the corn was less sweet, and served on the side In a separate container. The whole sandwich became a wet mess. Another annoyance was the paper lining of the plate - it got soaked and tore apart easily, I was scared a piece of it would get into my food.

Despite the food, I liked the restaurant. The staff was friendly and there were lots of seats and TVs. I think this place has potential. I will come back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place with fresh tasting seafood.

We got the beer flight with a pound of snow crab legs and a pound of mussels. We also got the oyster sliders. This was for two people and we got pretty good portions.

The oyster sliders were seasoned well and crispy. You can also order sides with it too. I really enjoyed the corn and vermicelli as the side"}
{"text":"The lobster roll is so good, the calms are fresh , but the garlic butter sauce is too salt"}
{"text":"Hope you are enjoying today's small salvo of reviews.  I want to wrap up my Valentine's Day 2018 reviews with the Good Catch.  Which is a pretty apropos name for what we are doing on this day - trying to land the Good Catch!  ;P

I've been here on more than a few occasions but most of the time, it has not been packed.  Which is confusing as they have a very nicely decorated place, located in the Downtown Markham Mall, conveniently set up for date nights with the VIP Theatre, and they have a great menu. 

Their oysters are delish and they have a good selection.  Expertly shucked, these briny bivalves are so good.  Their boils are excellent.  Full of flavour and lots and lots of Garlic.  Might want to not have too much of these during Date Night.  Their menu is full of items for anyone that likes seafood - it would be hard to try them all.

If you find yourself peckish after a late movie or just want some drinks, they have an excellent after 9PM happy hour menu.

Lots of parking at the side of the building near this place.  Don't bother with the underground - never a spot when you need one.

Happy date night people!  I for one will be doing my best not to be stampeded over by lovelorn, overhormoned, youngsters today and will stay safe indoors --- maybe!

Cheers."}
{"text":"Great place to satisfy your seafood cravings. 

The concept is similar to Captain's Boil: you can pick your catch and then customize the flavor and spice level according to your personal preference. They also have a raw bar for all you ceviche lovers. There are a few signature items I was definitely eyeing like the oyster sliders, their epic looking slaw and a very Instagrammable looking lobster nachos. 

It's a huge establishment that feels like a family friendly sports bar with great customer service. Perfect for a large group outing or for a date if you don't mind wearing a plastic bib and getting your hands dirty. 

I opted for the lobster roll (you have the choice of getting it served hot or cold) along with sweet potato fries (for a dollar extra) and Caesar salad. As one of the pricier items on the menu, I had high expectations but the dish definitely delivered. Served hot, there were generous chunks of buttery lobster nestled in a lightly toasted bun. So delicious, definitely something you will want to savor! The sweet potato fries were well seasoned. I got them thinking that the Cajun fries would be too spicy for me but they weren't spicy in the slightest. The salad was fresh although I wish they had more options to choose from. 

All in all, happy with the food and would come by again to try their other items."}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was all hype but lived up to it. Recently we can here for a friends birthday and seems the quality of the shrimp has been reduced. The shrimp texture seemed to be mushy... was definitely not impressed with that! I still very much enjoyed the soft shell crab rice but that was about it. My experience that evening was mediocre compared to when we first came when it was new. Considering the price is more than their competition their quality should be consistent or perhaps it was a bad night to order shrimp. Overall, service is good & resto is clean with a generally busy atmosphere."}
