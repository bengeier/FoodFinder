{"text":"Delicious fish & shrimp plus affordable. Friendly staff. Sauce's a little watery and fries a bit limp.   If I where to nitpick; fresher fish & shrimp but it's not bad. Overall you get what you pay for. I'm definitely coming back and would recommend."}
{"text":"The food is really good, place is clean, people are nice. They are not stingy with the sauce"}
{"text":"After a long hour of looking for a place to eat, We happened to stumble upon pirate fish and chips and I'm so glad We did!! I took my family of 6 and spent just under $40 which is pretty rare for us. Not only was the food fairly priced but it is probably the best fish and chips spot I've ever had. They're sauce is to die for!  Make sure you get a side of onion rings they're the best! The staff was great and I'm pretty sure the owner or manager was there and made sure to ask how our meal was going. The music they had playing was a plus! Was singing to all the songs! The only mistake that was made was that I didn't take a picture of our feast to put up with my review lol"}
{"text":"Best fish fry for your buck with debit option and as well as  wonderful a.c. dine in establishment"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! The staff is very warm and the dining area is clean. Loved the atmosphere and service! Only thing that would've made our visit better is fried zucchini"}
{"text":"they messed up my order and was in the drive through for at least 20 min.. slowest and worst service ive ever experienced!"}
{"text":"Waited in the drive through for 20 minutes. They messed up our order too. I ordered onion rings and they gave me a hamburger instead that I couldn't eat because I'm a vegetarian. I also ordered two water cups and they didn't give me those either. Will never be back here again."}
