{"text":"The Mound appetizer was awesome!  The wife and I also had the buffalo chicken salad.  It's nice how you can build your salad, so you get what you want on it.  There was a small lunch crowd, so it was fairly quiet.  The waitress was nice and attentive.  I have also had their slugger burger and it was great.  Try the double slugger if you are man enough.  The beer is cheap, and it is a good neighborhood bar.  We also played a little video gaming after lunch (we broke even).  I will defiantly be going back for more great food and drinks."}
{"text":"The bartenders are extremely rude!  They all walk around with an overwhelming sense of entitlement.   Laura, the weekend bartender, is a prime example of this. She's incredibly rude and doesn't have the slightest clue what customer service is. She needs to realize that she's a bartender at a local dump in Champaign Illinois-nothing more. Know your role!  Treat paying customers with some respect and reviews like this wouldn't happen.  Plenty of other local bars around...I'll go to anyone of them first before I give this place another dollar."}
{"text":"A good place for a dive bar and pizza offering in the middle of no where. While the food took a,l while the service was impeccable and place seemed a unique bar eating and drinking experience. Mainly locals seemed to predominant in this bar and it has an old look that may turn off some.  This bar was good enough and food pretty decent for being a dive"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite local spots. After tonight I will no longer be going back. After it being 130 and last call, everyone was told to get the f*** out. I work in the industry, I get it, you're tired you wanna get out and go home. You signed up for that closing shift man. But repeatedly at 130,140, 150, and 155, everyone get the f*** out. We get it man. You wanna go home. If that's your main concern then give your shift to someone else that cares please. Worst service ever. Couldn't remember what we ordered so ordered twice. Not only that, at 150 you said bars closed and said everyone needed to leave. Said I had to finish my drink and go, and the bartender stood over me. Super rude. Never again will I ever spend a late night at the classic \"pia's\"."}
{"text":"A great dive bar. Friendly bar staff, great prices (huge frosty beer steins for $2.50 on a Friday night, $7.50 pitchers with frosty glass pints to go with) and greasy pub grub. When we went around eleven or so the kitchen was closed but they said the fryer was still on and would remain so until 2AM.  They have indoor and outdoor space, excellent new video games, and a variety of seating from booths to tables, to high stools. They have a Texas Hold'em poker video game that is a lot of fun. I was skeptical of it at first, but it was really pretty cool, and not a terrible value. The decor is divey of the promotional variety and dark paneled walls to boot. Every other Friday night they have Karaoke which is why we went, but were off a week. I still had tons of fun.  The crowd was working class, but not at all scary or mean. It was a friendly, fun atmosphere and there were no students whatsoever. By this I mean it was awesome."}
{"text":"This was a good little bar. The burgers were fantastic and the staff was really friendly. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"We stopped in with our running group last week. The staff is friendly enough - definitely more likely  to help you when they're not as busy. The beer selection is okay but could be improved. The food is okay, not great. It's really cheap so you can't argue too much there. All of their condiments are available at the condiment bar except tomato so if you want tomato, you have to ask for it. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, which really didn't remind me too much of buffalo chicken so I'm not sure why they call it that. The crowd can also get a little obnoxious so, I'd be wary of that as well. There's an overwhelming aroma of urinal cake by the bathrooms where the dart board is. All in all, it's a  halfway decent place to stop in if you find yourself in the area but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Good prices and service. Great daily specials. Didnt eat but food looked good...we wish we would have been able to stay longer!"}
{"text":"Pia's is a local townie dive bar, and in that capacity, it deserves five stars. The ambience is casual and informal, the drinks are usually cheap (provided you like cheap domestic beer), and the food is actually pretty decent.  The beer selection is small, but if you're coming to a dive bar like this, you're probably looking for value rather than obscure craft beers. I would not trust the bartenders to make any mixed drinks that don't end with \"and coke,\" but again, you're not here to witness mixological prowess. If you like drinking straight whiskey, they can certainly handle that.  The food surprised me. If you enjoy the simple pleasure of chicken wings, burgers, onion rings, and the like, then you'll enjoy Pia's food. It's not excessively greasy and the prices are very reasonable, even compared to somewhere like Esquire.  The downside is that the music is sometimes too loud for the particular state of the bar. Recently, I was at Pia's on a Thursday and there were fewer than 15 people in the bar, but the music was playing at a level that would be more appropriate for a Friday night when the place is packed with people. It just seemed unnaturally loud for a bunch of people sitting around talking and drinking as opposed to partying. Whatever. It's not a big deal and is definitely subjective. The only reason I bring it up is to warn you that it's not necessarily a great place to go if you want to have a conversation, at least at night. If you're wanting to sit and talk, Esquire's volume level is much lower.  Overall, Pia's gives you exactly what you want in a dive bar: cheap beer, inexpensive and tasty food, and a refreshing lack of pretense."}
