{"text":"This place definitely has positives and negatives: 

Positives:
- Clean and the high-tech ventilation makes it so you don't leave smelling like kbbq, which is a definite plus 
- Plenty of tables so you don't have to wait long 
- Lots of Korean people eating here

Neutral: 
- I'm not sure how to feel about this, but they cook everything for you at the table. On one hand, it's nice as the person who usually cooks for everyone else at the table to be able to sit back, but on the other, our waitress was not friendly so it's really just awkward having her stand over your table and not say a word. She also didn't explain that she would cook it for you, she just walked away with the tongs. 

Negatives: 
- The entryway is a little awkward - when you first walk in and there are plenty of tables, they don't immediately seat you. The hostess just says something over the radio and then five minutes later of awkwardly standing in a really small area trying to maneuver around people leaving, someone else takes you to your seat. 
- The waitstaff is not friendly and they do not take the time to explain anything. I'm not new to Korean food or kbbq, but there were a lot of things that were new to me at this place and not explained. Our waitress just seemed irritated when we weren't immediately ready to order or didn't understand something. Plus they didn't take the time to explain the difference between their shared meal options versus ordering single dishes. 
- Pricey for what you get. Some things are terrific, but we ordered galbi and it was chewy and fatty - not worth the price. I'm not sure if we got a bad cut of meat, but it wasn't what we were expecting. 
- Nickel and dime you for everything - they don't give you rice, you have to ask for it. And then they almost shame you in the way they respond to you for asking for it, telling you that it's extra. 
- Banchan - they don't give you much, never refill, and different tables get different items. I'm not sure how they decide who gets what and they, again, don't have the time of day to explain anything to you. 

Overall I think the fun part of Korean bbq is getting full on inexpensive food in a laidback setting. The atmosphere seems too uptight and expensive to make it fun. From everything I heard about this place, I expected to leave really full, but I didn't think that the portions were huge compared to other places I have been. I can't imagine trying to go to this place as your first time Korean food or Korean bbq experience!"}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced! They serve fat not meat. If you want to eat fat then I recommend you go buy a packet of bacon and save $160.00 and the awkward feeling of someone speed cooking your meat (fat) at your table and then watch you scarf it down before they start cooking the next vat of fat!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic meal. My husband and I went on a very busy Saturday night. Had to wait for 30 minutes, but it was totally worth it. Will definitely return. Our waitress was so good, very helpful. UPDATE: I agree with other reviewers that this is an expensive place for Korean food, but (at least for us that night) the quality of the meats in our beef combination and the small vegetable dishes was excellent. I was so stuffed and had to take home the excellent Kimchi stew (which was lunch the next day.) So, we feel it was worth it. I highly recommend this place for a date night or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat for BBQ fans and meat fans alike. Some friends and I came in for some lunch. Lindsey was our server and was also an excellent chef. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"We have been excited to come here since seeing it listed on Yelp. Brought some out of town friends along with our family looking forward to a fun night.....but after we sat down we discovered half of our large party who don't eat beef or pork had literally zero choices. No chicken, no veggie, nothing!  So we left. shocked they would not have at least one option available!  Very poor decision and bummer for us. Don't come here unless EVERYONE in your party eats beef or pork."}
{"text":"Sizzle was the best Korean BBQ place I have been too. The staff was friendly and personable.

I Started with Makkoli which was amazing!

I then ordered Steamed Egg, and the beef for 2 platter. Our waiter was a pro and cooked all of our meat to perfection. 

Overall Sizzle was amazing and I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good Korean BBQ place."}
{"text":"Very skeptical of a Korean BBQ restaurant in desert ridge but we tried it and were pleasantly surprised! We tried the prime boneless short rib and it was delicious. Was even better with the baked sea salt they bring out as a side for dipping. Meat was very tender and fresh. We also had the marinated prime bulgogi thinly sliced beef. Very good too, marinade was light but added a lot of flavor. Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because of the price which I understand is high because of the location. Fingers crossed this place maintains the level of quality and stays around for a while."}
{"text":"Came in late on a Sunday and had great food with excellent service. Great little K-BBQ spot in SDL"}
{"text":"Great authentic Korean BBQ, where they cook for you. The meat was very good quality. The entire experience was not as Americanized, which I preferred."}
{"text":"The pork belly  here is the best I have ever had!Pretty good korean bbq!And the service here is pretty good."}
{"text":"We had to drive quite a ways to get to this restaurant, but it was worth it!!!
The spicy pork shoulder butt was one of the best we've had and the beef galbi was delicious.  The shirred egg was also delicious along with all many side dishes.  The waiter and waitresses were also very friendly and helpful.  We truly enjoyed the dinner."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing I went back the very next day and took my friend who owned a Korean restaurant once to get her take.  I've been to Korean BBQ before, but it has never been as good as this.  Our waitress the first day, Jenny, was so sweet and gave us great suggestions.  We had the bulgogi and pork short rib.  Both were perfectly marinated and so tender!  Now, every time I've been to Korean BBQ, I've eaten the fermented veggies as an appetizer and then had the bulgogi with meat and rice separately.  Maybe I've been doing it wrong all along or I just needed someone like Jenny to show me the ropes.  Jenny recommended eating the veggies with the meat.  She suggested making a taco out of the pickled radish!  So pickled radish, then fill with meat, top with some red sauce and spicy scallions...my friends, TRY IT, it's a party in your mouth!!!!

I love this place and will definitely be back, but a few suggestions:

You HAVE to order at least two BBQ items to sit at the grill.  The second time I went with a friend that was vegetarian and she obviously was not going to get meat. They don't have any vegetarian options for the grill.  If they could do tofu, grilled veggies, some seafood or something, it would be smart.  It was a lengthy discussion to understand why I couldn't order just one grilled item while she ordered the special and she would just give me her meat.  They let us sit at the grill regardless of the confusion and let me order one BBQ item, but it was frustrating to get there.

Second, I know they just opened and I went within the first week, but I felt like the headphones and the running around made it seem a little bit too frantic for such an intimate place. Maybe this will get ironed out over the next few months, but it seemed unnecessary for such a small place. 

Overall!  Amazing food and I can't wait for some other foodie friends to try it!"}
{"text":"So good with great service! I've never been to Korean BBQ before and I had a great first experience. There are few Asian restaurants up here in north Phoenix and it's very refreshing to see a Korean BBQ place! Our server was kind enough to explain what all the side dishes were and was overall very helpful with everything. The food was phenomenal. Everything was so fresh and was all beautifully presented!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with four friends, including one who is Korean. Had the beef combo for lunch and while the sides are  excellent, the beef was grissley and of poor cut (half fat!). You also have to request kimchi (not automatic) and you are charged extra for rice. One friend has beef allergy and ordered tofu soup and they brought it with meat in it. $150 lunch that we secretly spit in our napkins. Avoid!!!"}
{"text":"I come here twice a week, their service is great and food quality is awesome!!! I used to live in Ktown in LA, i think this place is better than Ktown restaurant and Korea!!! Also, they released new menu which is Korean shaved ice. It's AMAZING!! You guys should try it!!! Love this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience with the service and the Managment being cheap, dirty table when we sat down and found hair in the rice, the managers excuse was that it's very busy and that they are under staffed, got 10% off!! lol seriously??? We are disgusted with the place at this time... like I care about that, our first time there and we will not be back and we do not recommend this place at all! Stay away! Aside from all that The waitress was nice and isn't her fault."}
{"text":"As a restaurant manager, let me tell you how amazing our server Mikaela was. People don't understand how much skill it takes to take care of 3 tables, get all of their orders, refill all of their drinks and cook all of their meat! She was fantastic. Be ready to break the bank a bit, but we tipped her 40% because she deserved it!"}
{"text":"Loved this cold stone since I was a kid and now the bratty snobby bitches working there jip you and barely give you shit"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! BBQ at your table, great quality and value. Definitely will  plan to come back."}
{"text":"Finally New Korean BBQ Restaurant in Arizona!!!!
Large combo, big potions, variety of prime meat,  and can feed up to four people.  I ordered the prime boneless short rib, the seasoned prime boneless short rib,  the prime Wagyu beef belly, and the prime brisket. Best Korean Bbq I have ever had! Don't forget the eight different side dishes that you can use to mix and match with your meat."}
{"text":"It was pretty expensive based on what you're paying for. I don't like that they won't let you cook it yourself. I think that is normally the appeal of Korean BBQ so I am disappointed about that."}
{"text":"Sizzle is a nice addition to the currently lacking Korean food offerings in Scottsdale. It's a somewhat \"upscale\" Korean BBQ, hence the high prices. First off, the food - the meat is well seasoned and good quality.  We opted for the beef meal, as opposed the the pork.  Supposedly serves 3-4 people though obviously this depends on how hungry you are!  Would be nice to be able to have a package meal with mix-and-match since the ala cart options can be even more pricey.  The side dishes (Banchan) were so-so.  Surprisingly, we didn't have any cabbage kimchi.  I'm not sure if they were out?  Seems like this is standard with korean food.  Service was nice and helpful. In our case, they actually cooked the food for us - again, I'm not sure if this is standard here, but it's a nice touch if you're not used to Korean BBQ.  In most places I've been to, the patrons cook themselves, which either adds or detracts from the experience, depending on your preferences. Personally, I enjoy the self-cook option but to each his/her own!  Would make reservations if you're planning to try Sizzle, since the venue is tiny."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I ate the beef combo for 2 here for lunch today for our first time. When it said for 2 we thought \"For 2\", no, we got so much meat and sides that there is left overs to feed a small family .  Left overs arent a bad thing though Was a little surprised it was $117 out the door including tip.  A bit of a pricey lunch, lol.  Sizzle has a great atmosphere and a friendly staff. The server cooks at your table which is a fun gesture - and the food is good.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good but not worth the price. You can go to an all you eat BBQ for $25/person in California for the same quality. The service was pretty good."}
{"text":"We thought it was such a great experience! Our server, Ashley, really took care of us. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best KBBQ in Arizona hands down. Good quality meat, nice workers, and actual korean staff."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place a chance and see if it lives up to my expectations compared to a restaurant at Korean Town that I frequent:

Food:  GOOD-quality food for a Mall restaurant; but, price is definitely not $$.  this is a $$$$ restaurant.  Expect to spend $85 minimum for couples date night.

Service:  POOR-.  For the price I am paying, I should expect excellent service.

Authenticity: MEDIOCRE- missing many other Korean condiments.  For Americans its novelty bbq table is intriguing.  But that's it."}
{"text":"Best Korean barbecue in town for sure!!! Meat is always fresh. The servers are trained to cook the meat for you to make sure you don't over cook them yourself. Highly recommend to do the combo so you can try different varieties of meat. Their steam egg, beef short rib soup and kimchi fried rice are excellent as well. If you got Julie the manager to grill the meat for you then you are in luck, best meat I have ever had among the five, six times I have been here. They are definitely pricier but you get what you pay for. Also they have shaved ice now and it's a must try!! Also best shaved ice in arizona"}
{"text":"Great concept, fun atmosphere, amazing food! It's not easy finding good Korean BBQ with this quality of meat. I should know because I am a foodie and Korean who has tried many before. Excellent presentation and all the side dishes 'Banchan' are also delicious. My favorite combo is Galbi, Pork Bulgogi and Kimchi Stew with Soju. They have friendly staff and attentive service. A must try new spot!"}
{"text":"The best Korean BBQ in Arizona. I wouldn't say it's on par with LA BBQ places but it's the closest thing you can get here without going to California. Everything is good about this place I just wish they allowed to grill our own meat. Maybe they can help grilling more complicated stuff like huge pieces of steak but the rest I can handle myself. I really hope we get more of these kind of places in Tempe, Chandler, or Mesa, so that I don't have to drive 30-40 minutes."}
{"text":"It is a cool place- reminded me of real Korean restaurant in Korea. Price was reasonable if you order combo menu. We did beef combo it comes w four different Tate of beef - you can taste each beef different taste. We will go back this time we will try pork combo. Very clean and great service. It is a quite driving from my house but it was worth it. Best Korean restaurant in az. I believe this is better than gogi. Sorry gogi but you cannot beat fresh cooked meat. However it is pricey if you order single meat instead of combo. We recently found another Korean bbq place it is friendly and reasonably priced w really fresh meats and fresh side dishes."}
{"text":"The meat quality is so good!
I ordered the combo $99. The server was cooking for me.  I got to enjoy all the authentic side dishes that they have. This place is recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary as far as Korean food is concerned, place is clean, friendly and helpful staff but a little too pricey, we spent $120 for 2 adults. It was a great experience but not quiet worth the price."}
{"text":"This was awesome! We had the beef combo was very good. The quality of beef is amazing. Would strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Visited two times in a row. Food was ok but Lady was unpleasant and service was poor.
This was one of the worst restaurants. We were very unhappy while we were eating. It was the same the next day. Our family will not stop by again."}
{"text":"This is a very authentic place.  Great atmosphere and excellent food.  This is much nicer than the Korean BBQ places that we frequented while living in Honolulu.  They bring out 10 side dishes to start with great presentation, all the flavors are great, and the meat appears to be very high quality.  I'm really glad to see this type of culture in Arizona.  This is a clean and well managed restaurant. A+"}
{"text":"They setting is nice. The food is ok. I found the beef to be tender and good but the pork is bland. The place is way overpriced. $50+ for pork combo for two but the serving is small. It's great if you have an appetite of a baby. The service is poor. We brought a cake to celebrate my wife's bday; however, when we asked for it to be brought out she brought out the cake only, no plates, forks, etc. Terrible! Don't order rice because that's an extra $2 for a small cup. I've never seen an Asian place charging for rice especially for that price when it costs 10 cents to make. Not coming back."}
{"text":"The service was nice, the food OK, pricing was too high. It would have been worth it if they gave you enough soup for 4 when you order the combo for 4 and the side dishes were lame- I do not consider a bowl of raw onions or seasoned green onions side dishes. The only Asian restaurant I have ever been to that charges $2 for every bowl of white rice- really I just paid $100 for the combo- wtf"}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ in Arizona. Meat quality matters and theirs was well picked. The sides are tasty and the service is very friendly. The taste is authentic. Would recommend for first time Korean BBQ'ers to try heir set menu either beef or pork and have fun! Also, their ventilation system is one of the best because the vents sit low to the grill instead of a hood over your head. Thanks, Sizzle!"}
{"text":"This place is decent, as far as food goes, but not for the price...more than a bit overpriced, but I guess that's to be expected. This place is actually a lite version of a very successful Korean BBQ place (well, places, I guess bc there are many locations) in Southern CA, but they just don't take care of the customer quite as well. We were almost afraid to ask for more side dishes, as the waitress just made us feel really uncomfortable like we were putting her out. Not that the side dishes are anything to rave about to begin with.

My wife and I went here and got 2 combos, 1 pork and 1 beef. $200+ tab for two people...you would think that when we ask for a single bowl of rice, it would be included, but nope...$2 for a bowl of rice which maybe if you're not Korean you might not know what I mean, but c'mon...that's pretty ridiculous...

Used to like this place, but now completely turned off..."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Best Korean food in the valley. It's a bit expensive, but the quality of the food is high--vegetables and meat are really fresh. Also, the servers are attentive. Sometimes in other places, you have to ask for the side dishes to be replenished, but here she just replaced them for us. Ambiance is quite fine--nice, clean, and bright. Not always true with Korean restaurants. I used to have to go to LA to get my Korean food fix, but now I'll just come here."}
{"text":"This place is great, Scottsdale (and Arizona) needs more places like this!

Authentic Korean BBQ - they grill the meat for you, right in front of you, to order. The direct vents above each grill are great, and the place isn't greasy at all (like some Korean BBQ places we've been to). Loved all the banchan (pre-meal tapas), and the dishware (metal bowls for banchan, thin metal chopsticks) was authentic and what we saw in Korea. 

We got the large beef combo for 3 of us, and loved the variety of meat: the boneless short rib and (surprisingly) the outside skirt meat were our favorites - both were thick, juicy, and perfectly cooked! Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Best KBBQ I've ever been to. I typically go to the all-you-can-eat KBBQ joints, but I know better now!

First of all the service here is impeccable. Second, the meat quality is amazing. Third, the delicious sides have unlimited refills!

Seriously, the price of a meal here is comparable to an AYCE place, while having superior quality. Unless you need to overeat to feel satisfied, Sizzle is a must try!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had never been here before and we had a great time! We had spicy pork and marinated short rib (delicious)! We also had a side of kimchi fried rice and that was probably my favorite. Great and fun place with a very nice server. It's also in a great location. 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"Finally we get good Korean BBQ in phoenix.  It reminds me of Hobak up in Vegas which is my fave."}
{"text":"Delicious food until you get the bill. Their food is waaaaaaay too over priced. We paid $160 for a family of 4 and my kids are only 3 and 6 with tiny bellies and don't eat much. $38 for 3 pieces of kalbi??!  Ridiculous. 

When we first walked in they couldn't figure out where to seat us. We came with a group of 11 so they put chairs around two tables close to each other but the people sitting in the middle didn't have table room. So... how would they eat?  Off to the side?  We ended up sitting by ourselves and separating from our group.  We asked several times for items and they took forever to bring them to us. When we got seated we weren't given drinks or menus. Then the lady came over to take our order when we didn't even have menus yet... I'm like.. can we get water at least?  Shouldn't they take drink orders right away?  Anyway, the lady that seemed in charge did not have good customer service. Everyone else seemed more competent.

4 stars for food quality 
2 stars for customer service 
1 star for ridiculous pricing"}
{"text":"The service here SUCKs!!!! We told them we would like to cook by ourselves and they wouldn't even ask if we need to order anything more. The manager's attitude is even worse. I wouldn't recommend any of my friend to come here! Such a bad experience."}
{"text":"While I'm really glad to have Korean bbq in desert ridge I have to echo some of the concerns about hosting issues. It is a small loud space and it was very difficult hearing anything the hostess tonight was saying when we were trying to get a table. This caused confusion when we gave her our names and enough frustration when we figured out what the wait time actually was for us to just go somewhere else. We might have been totally okay with a long wait if that had been effectively communicated to us initially."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and experience!! So many options and flavors with all the sides. Trevor was a great server!"}
{"text":"Best korean restaurant in phoenix. Service is great. Food is amazing. Cho help us a lot in choosing the menu. The combo small is enough for 3 or 4 persons. I love it! So happy that we choose this restaurant."}
{"text":"The host working Saturday, July 22 was an absolute disgrace to this restaurant. She was rude from the moment we walked in. She never greeted anyone politely, didn't say \"thank you\" to anyone leaving, and  stared at her phone the entire time. She would not be a person I would want representing this place because once we sat our server was amazing and the food was delicious.

I suggest the beef combo, you pick one from each and there is plenty of food for 2-3 people to share."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has 1-2 stars from some of the reviews but from my experience I would say it's a great addition to The District here in AZ. I'm a huge fan of KBBQ and I have been to plenty of the well known spots in LA (Parks, Genwa...etc), so I can tell you that this place was definitely good. 

We went during a Friday night and were seated right away in one of the booths. Our banchan was already on the table when we sat which shows you the top notch service you will be receiving throughout the night. We ordered the small beef combo and picked the beef brisket, boneless short rib, marinated short rib, thinly sliced beef and the kimchi stew with the Chamisul soju. Our banchan even included the steamed egg which was nice to add into the kimchi stew making it even more flavorful. All the sides were very fresh and our server even asked if we wanted more. 

In terms of the meat, it was like climbing a ladder and the flavors just got better and better as you reached the top. The portions were only for two but we were definitely full by the end. It seems like people are complaining about the server being there and cooking for you but that's  how it's done in most places in LA and isn't a big deal. I would say it's actually better that the customers don't handle the meat anyway since we tend to over/undercook it most of the time. Also, in terms of the \"awkwardness\" of the server overhearing your convos, it's really not like that at all and we were actually engaging in conversation with them as they were cooking which made the experience super chill. 

I truly enjoyed this place and plan on returning/recommending it to friends!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty...I went to dinner with 3 others and shared 2 orders of marinated beef ribs and 1 order of pork belly...all veey tasty but my favorite is always the beef ribs (galbi). Rice is extra which should come with the meal... I'm asian and that goes against my grain but what can you do. Also tried the mango ice desert...very refreshing and yummy. Our waitress was great, nice and cooked everything perfect. Will go again soon"}
{"text":"This was my first Korean BBQ experience ever and it did not disappoint. We went for my daughters 13th birthday with 8 guests and everyone was very pleased. The food was delicious and the staff was very helpful. The only recommendation was that we needed more water and it did not come fast enough. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday with my husband and brother to celebrate a birthday. I have had Korean barbecue before and it is pretty good. However that was back in California. This place was OK, but not really worth the money I spent. It wasn't anything over-the-top and for the three of us we probably spent 250 bucks with drinks. I probably would've rather gone to a steakhouse. That's just my opinion."}
{"text":"I thought this place was delicious. I got the bibimbop in a sizzling hot pot and it was bomb. Some places don't heat the stone bowl hot enough and as a result, the rice isn't crispy, but this place did it right. I also got galbi and it was soo good. Good portion. I even had enough to take home. Oh, and the bon chon was on point! Jenny was our server and she was great, attentive but not intrusive."}
{"text":"We were looking for a traditional Korean table BBQ, and we should have known when we realized it was located inside a mall...  it's mostly geared towards the mall customers rather than those looking for the traditional Korean food.  One plus is that when you order the table BBQ items, the server actually grills the meat for you which is something I had never experienced before."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Better than Hawaii and Julie the manager was fantastic! She even held our 7 month old son so we could eat for a min! We will be back! Take all of our money!!!!"}
{"text":"Really good, really fresh, kind of strange that they cook the food for you as most Korean bbq places don't, but I rather enjoyed it, you can focus on the food that way which was superb! Love the side dishes as well, kimchi fried rice was the bomb but I think the soybean soup was fantastic! Very flavorful, we had the beef combo, can't wait to try the pork combo, or just the reg menu."}
{"text":"It was an \"almost\" good experience!

My wife and I were excited to try this Korean BBQ out since it had received such good reviews from others.  We were seated at the table of our choice.  Normal sides were offered except for traditional kimchi which we had to request. We ordered our first meat entre' and it was delicious. We decided to order it again.  Unfortunately, the 2nd go-round was when our experience turned negative.  The meat was fatty & chewy to the point that I couldn't digest it.  I had to run to the restroom to spit it out. I then got sick (details omitted due to it being gross).

The service was friendly and our waitress was great.  I can't say we'd be returning, however, simply because I'm scared of the food."}
{"text":"The presentation here was excellent. Our server cooked for us table side. We had the Bulgogi, Wagyu, Kimchi soup, in a combo. There were three meets, lots of sides and great conversation. Service was prompt. We arrived at 4 on a Tuesday and were seated immediately. There is a two hour wait on weekends."}
{"text":"I loved this place and concept!  I had never tried Korean BBQ before so I didn't know what to expect. The combo meat platters are the way to go if you have 2-3 or more people. Make sure to ask for rice as it doesn't come with it. The saki and wine were tasty and reasonably priced. 

Had a blast."}
{"text":"I haven't been able to find a really good, authentic Korean restaurant and this is finally it! Worth the wait!! The food was fresh and delicious. The side dishes are already at the table by the time you take your seat! Love their kimchi and the salad was delicious!!! I ordered bulgogi and galbi, better than my grandmothers!!! So flavorful and anyone who has eaten Korean BBQ know that it's a little pricey so don't be surprised. But the drinks are also delicious. Everything was freshly made. What an experience. I'll say this, whenever you see Koreans at a Korean restaurant you know it's worth a try! You won't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"A bit expensive, and it may not be the best with kids but the food was really good. The thing that got to us was the fact we got no napkins, even when we asked for them. This was a good experience, but I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"BBQ quality meat, tasty side dishes and the spicy squid dish was very authentic. I'm Korean and I've been looking for an authentic, top notch food and service place. They grill the meat for you so you can focus on eating. It's clean and dishes were authentic."}
{"text":"This place is top notch. I can honestly say it is the best Korean barbecue restaurant in the valley. For those in the know about Korean food, this is like the quality of Baekjeong but with a chic modern design. The only downsides are that you still have servers that are not completely familiar with Korean cuisine and the prices are a bit high. However, it was completely worth it to me!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had never had Korean BBQ before and had walked past this restaurant multiple times at Desert Ridge. We finally decided to try it and had an overall pleasant experience. The staff was nice and our server did a good job of explaining all the foods and had a good sense of humor! We chose to do the pork combo which was three courses for two people. I would not recommend doing this for one reason- the first course was pork belly and was just strips of almost inedible pork fat. Outside of that, the food was great and we enjoyed trying something new! It is a bit pricy, especially if you get drinks ($30-$40 per person) but it is a fun experience! I'm not necessarily the most adventurous food person but I really liked the pork shoulder, the egg bake, and the soybean stew!"}
{"text":"Thank you to #ChefQ for bringing such clean, vibrant, and delicately devious flavors and colors of Korean cuisine to the table at Desert Ridge, N . Phoenix, AZ! My lunch consisted of the Bibimbap lunch/dinner plate with kimchi. The rice, vegetables, meat, soup, and noodles were perfection!  My beverage was Bokbunjaju which is also a new favorite of mine! Very cool Vibe- I love the K-pop too!! Gomabsenbnida, !! #awesome #daebak 
I am so glad Sizzle is here to share your culture, language, music, and best of all your skill in the Art of food Chef Q!  #ilovekoreanfood"}
{"text":"Very good. The meats are cooked for you at the table. If you want privacy for your conversation, tell the server that you want to cook by yourself. Seems expensive, but the quality and flavors are spot -on. You'll leave satiated."}
{"text":"Beyond our expectations- for suburban Phoenix this is as close to Authentic Korean BBQ as it gets. Great side dishes and a wonderfully Informative server - thank you!  We will be back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Korean restaurant in Arizona and we have tried almost all of them. The quality of the beef is by for the best in Arizona for Korean bbq. This will be our regular spot."}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant it was a little awkward because there is not much of a waiting area and the hostess stand is pushed up right next to the only usable door (the only other door says not to use it).  As my family and I waited for a table it was strange to be standing and blocking the only entrance/exit in the restaurant as other customers were trying to squeeze by.  

We ordered a variety of food and I liked how there was a wide variety of side dishes that are complimentary with your meal.  However, they do charge extra for white rice, which I assumed would be included with the meal since I ordered a variety of meat and a few appetizers/soups.  I enjoyed the concept of having the waiter cook your meat for you at your table.  I would recommend the bulgolgi, it was really good, and infused with fresh garlic.  My least favorite was the steak (I believe ribeye) it had way too much fat and it was not seasoned at all so there was a lack of flavor.  I would give the side dishes a 2.5/5 because they weren't that great compared to other Korean restaurants I've tried (Ban Chan in Mesa has the best Korean side dishes so after eating theirs its hard to compare).  I would rate the meats and concept a solid 4/5 altogether.  

The price was way too much for the amount of food we got.  We ordered quite a few things, but for a family of 4 we spent about $150 and still were able to eat dessert elsewhere afterwards.  Therefore, for the value of the meal I would subtract a star.  

The service was decent.  It wasn't crowded when I went, and some of the employees were just standing around waiting for dinner rush to come.  I would recommend going during an off time because it still took them awhile to seat us despite being empty and the restaurant only has about 15 tables in the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Korean food. Julie the manager was a perfect server.  This is not a cheap place but it is good quality and atmosphere.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been in Cali long enough to appreciate good Korean BBQ, and Scottsdale hasn't been a great place to get it. So I was more than intrigued when a heralded place opened in Desert Ridge of all places.

Walking in, everything smells and looks right - sizzling meat and grills at every table. For a party of 2 on a weekday night, we had about a 30 minute wait. Luckily the buzzer gave us half off beers at Nori while we wait!

So we sit down, spread of side dishes ready for us. We opt for sharing the beef course for 2 - you have multiple options, but galbi and bulgogi are a must! We also had the kimchi fried rice and seafood pancake too.

Kimchi fried rice was great with the egg, and seafood pancake did have protein inside - though it felt a little too uniform for me.

This place is very newbie friendly, because they cook everything for you. EVERYTHING. On the one hand, it's convenient, but if you know what you're doing you enjoy cooking it yourself. Also weird having long conversations with your server right there. Kind of felt like discount Benihana.

Overall the meat was phenomenal - as you'd expect when they source specific cuts from around 10 different butchers. But compared to everywhere else I been, I felt it was way too expensive. Probably due to the service - paying steakhouse prices for a third to half of the food for that same cost at even a la carte joints in Bay Area. And we have markup to deal with.

I was definitely happy with my meal but my wallet was not. The bigger meat packages 4-5 are at a slightly better value, so I would probably only go back to try that."}
{"text":"A small cute place at the mall, easy to find and parking was a breeze. It looks brand new. Doesn't compete with Vegas but it is good. Lots of side dishes and the service was good. I do think it's on the expensive side for what it is."}
{"text":"I debated whether to leave this review but I decided it might be helpful to people deciding whether or not to dine here. We arrived with a party of 8. The staff was nice. We sat and quickly realized that all they have on the menu is beef or pork. No chicken or seafood option. How on earth can a restaurant in this location alienate such a big part of their possible customers?! We had to leave.  I'm hopeful they re-evaluate and expand their menu. It's necessary IMO."}
{"text":"This place is SO good. Every time I have been, I have left completely full and satisfied. They have a lot of great sides that are available and They have great quality meats. The only thing I would note is that a server comes to cook your food, which isn't the usual authentic Korean BBQ style. BUT they are always very attentive to make sure the food isn't under or over cooked. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go to hang out with friends or take a date. The food is to say the least, to die for!! Try this place if you like great food!! Have a full wine and beer selections. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Been here a few times, and the food never disappoints! The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and will explain the menu and the best way to truly experience korean bbq, just don't hesitate to ask! I will continue to eat here for as long as this place stands."}
{"text":"I will try keep this short and to the point. I was excited for this new restaurant at Desert Ridge. I always though with Korean BBQ they brought the meat etc to you and you cook it yourself at your pace. At this place, THAT IS NOT THE CASE. When the uncooked food was put on the table, I reached for the tongs that they left and the waitress freaked out. At this place, they do ALL the table cooking. So basically we sat for 20 minutes in awkward silence during most of the meal as this woman stood over us. So uncomfortable. The other issue is that she only cooked one thing at a time so it took sooooo long. I was done before others started. And again, all the while this woman stood over us. Zero privacy. Creepy and awkward. Last issue..very expensive!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice.  Love the concept but not impressed with the service, especially at the prices they charge.  Not going again."}
{"text":"First time going for family dinner there this past weekend. We ordered the large beef combo. We thought it was delicious until we got home. All night and the next day, we had upset stomach. It was awful! It wasn't just one of us that had it either. It was ALL of us. I can say that we definitely won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"Sizzle is a cool place to be leaving hungry or get hungry after 20 minutes.. we ordered the entree to feed 3-4 people on the beef section and we ordered the entree that feeds 3-4 people on the pork section. We had a table of 7 so I feel like that should be enough we also ordered 7 rice because their rice is a size of your palm but it is only 2$. Nobody got drinks because their drinks a little on the pricey side. I asked one of the waiters he said that's a lot of food. Our waitress doesn't really know How to speak English that well so we had to listen carefully i don't know why out of all the waiters you give someone who doesn't know how to speak English.. they give you sides right away and you eat them I guess before the food comes and each person gets salt spicy chili sauce and spicy oil for your meats to marinate them in. Our waitress did not explain that I had to ask the other waiter again and he's like yeah I don't know why she didn't explain. The meats the grill are good but I'm sorry it's not a lot of food for the price you pay. Our bill came up to be 257$ and majority of us were still hungry. That's about 36$ a person for 36$ I should be eating at a high end restaurant. This place has a potential but it's not a place for me unless I want to spend a lot of money like there's some type of gold in their meat. This is for those small appetite people who don't need to eat like me."}
{"text":"First time here and it's so good!! Meat is clearly great quality! The manager served us and was so nice and answered all our questions! It's get cooked right in front of you and whoever you go with(a private table). We will for sure be back! Also the whole restaurant is packed so that's a good sign!"}
{"text":"Satisfying. Second time at Sizzle and it's SOOO good. The customer service is great, it's a great atmosphere, and the food is even better. My sister and I ordered the Beef BBQ Combo and the meat was most definitely succulent. Our servers were Jenni and Kelly and they made sure we were okay throughout the meal."}
{"text":"They defiantly give you as much food you can eat. But sushi quality is low of course to compensate for the one price fits all Apatite."}
{"text":"Really delicious but expensive. We, my daughter and I, had dinner there this week and we shared the pork combo! The price was $54.00! I had one beer and the bill with tip was over $70.  I would go again,but the price would stop me from going often!"}
{"text":"The service is good. And the food is alright but i have never really liked korean food but this place does well. I ate up everything. It was oretty cool  having the food cooked infront of us"}
{"text":"Very good idea just very poor execution. The service is not so good. The menu and ordering is complicated for someone not very familiar with Korean BBQ. And that calls for great service to educate you on the food and menu. Unfortunately this place lacks that.

The food itself is very bland. The give you several condiments to add but even using them all it is still bland.

While I am not usually one to complain about price the 2 $ signs on the Yelp reviews are very misleading. It would be hard for 2 people to eat here for less than $100.

All in all if you are Korean or at least very familiar with the food you may like it here. If you are not you will not feel very welcome."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best korean bbq I have ever had. I've been going here ever since the soft opening and I got the receipts to prove the monthly visits that followed! The meat quality is outstanding. Very tender, and fresh. The fact that they have a lot of banchan available and meats, it is definitely worth the price in my opinion. I live 45 minutes away and I still make the 3 trips a month to be here. I highly recommend those who want a high quality kbbq experience."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the hubby and our son.  I wasn't very hungry so I was going to just share the short ribs with my son.  I was told that we are not allowed to order just one meat and we would either have to order another entree or a side dish.  I like the steamed egg so I was going to get that but was told that the steamed egg or side of rice doesn't make the cut.  I thought this to be very strange and somewhat rude.  The reasoning for making us order off the side menu is because they provide the table with numerous side/condiment style dishes.   Um, I didn't ask for 75 tapas style bowls and plates for my BBQ.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean BBQ. Thank Goodness  we highly recommend this place. Great atmosphere, cool vibe"}
{"text":"I feel this is a Korean BBQ targeted for the inexperienced white diners. The brand new Seoul BBQ & Sushi on I-17 is way better.  Sizzle is the first Korean restaurant I had to ask for Kimchee and rice. The meat is very fatty for the cost."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say I love and grew up eating Korean barbeque. I have eaten Korean barbeque in Seoul, LA K-town and Seattle. I know what good Korean barbeque should be. 

I was so looking forward to this place because yelp photos looked great. 

Service: Yeah like other yelpers say, it is weird/kind of annoying that they cook the meat for you. I definitely like cooking the meat on my own at other Kbbq places. However, I do want to praise that the servers are very attentive. Banchan was fresh and tasty. 

Food: My party of 7 ordered the beef and pork combo. This place is definitely quality over quantity. Quality of the meats are great and all were very tasty. However, portions are small of what you pay for the combo. Also I would like to add, I was so surprised Sizzle charges rice!!! I  mean rice and korean bbq ALWAYS GO TOGETHER! Jiggae (the soup) was awesome but without rice just didn't feel right. Honestly I felt hungry after eating, so Sizzle please consider including rice in all Korean bbq orders. Fried rice at the end with the combination order would be perfect. 

Price: This was the first Korean barbeque place in Arizona that hasn't disappointed me. Great that the place had a clean atmosphere, with attentive service and great tasting food. However, I feel the prices here are way overpriced for Korean bbq. For the same price in LA K-town, I can get more meat and get stuffed silly."}
{"text":"I really hope this business stays open as I love the diversity that it brings to a boring eating area. It is pricey. We ordered the combo for$99 that served 4 

The meat was very good. Although the sides that came with it were small the sage side was fine in size, but the potato salad side was ridiculous. A tablespoon each was way to small

The first server, David, was good. Very informative. The person that actually cooked the meal for us barely interacted with us and we felt rather rushed as we ate. 

The round table was really tight for four people."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness - if you haven't been to Sizzle yet, GO NOW! It is the most incredible interactive dining experience and the food is authentic and DELICIOUS. We came on a triple date and everyone had a blast! There were so many different diets in the group and at Sizzle, there was something for everyone. 

First, they serve a variety of small appetizer type dishes like pickled veggies, salad, eggs, and more. Then, you choose the type of meats that you would like and the waitress cooks it up right in front of you! My favorites were the boneless beef short ribs (both marinated and regular are great) and the thinly sliced brisket. My group got pork as well but I wasn't as much of a fan because I don't love fatty meats. (I know, i'm the weirdest person ever who doesn't like bacon!) If you like bacon, you'll like the pork. Then you choose whether you want Kimchi stew or soy bean stew to go along with the meats and the Kimchi stew was AMAZING!!! I considered myself not a Kimchi fan until I had it at Sizzle. I am obsessed with theirs! The base is way more tomato-sauce-like and not super fermented. Yes, please!  

I love the sauces that they serve on the side for dipping as well. I also got some rice to go along with it. We left so full and happy. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This was my first Korean BBQ experience and I loved it. They waiter was not friendly but he answered all our questions and helped us as needed but I would have liked at least a smile. I went at about 11pm so maybe he was tired, will try going earlier next time to see. Also I thought we would get to grill ourselves but he did it for us, not sure if it's because it was our first time or that's how it always is. All the side dishes were very yummy too."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean BBQ yet. You won't be disappointed. Wagyu beef, Bibimbap and sides were 5 star. The staff are amazing also."}
{"text":"Excellent meat, condiments, and other traditional Korean dishes with authentic spices and genuine taste. The server was very attentive, came by several times to check on us, and most importantly, she cooked the meat precisely the way it should be done as if we were in Korea.  In fact, I was surprised to find this type of \"set up\" in Phoenix. I am glad we came."}
{"text":"We've been in Phoenix for 5 years and haven't found any decent Asian food anywhere. I really wanted to like this restaurant. I knew it was going to be expensive but I don't care if the food is good.  
It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. Like some others said.... everything was very bland and not true Korean food.  If you know Korean food, you know one thing Korean food is not is bland. I'm Korean so I should know. 
My friend who is white thought it was good but he even thought it was underwhelming and over priced.  We have never been to asian restaurant that doesn't give rice w their dish.  Really, is collecting $2.00 for scoop of rice, good business decision?   Especially for Korean food! All the side dish is meant to be eaten w rice! Lol
The $35.00 order of beef was very small and it tasted even smaller. 
The server (Cindy) was quite rude... barley made eye contact and was put off by us asking for soy sauce.  (Yes. They don't have soy sauce on their table and no napkins... just cocktail napkins. Very weird) 
Bottom line...  if u want REALLY OVER PRICED food that is bland and pretends like Korean food... u should go.  But if you want good Korean food over priced or not...this isn't the place. 
I am VERY surprised of all good reviews...I guess if you haven't had decent Asian food u might think this is good."}
{"text":"Pricey but definitely good food. Usually get the beef combo which is more than enough food but like my cheap ass said... little pricey"}
{"text":"I've always gone to the all you can eat buffet and all that but for some reason this was really really delicious!! We order the beef small combo for two and r side of rice the rice is 2$ each .. and omg! Heaven they cook the meat for us and I didn't have to do anything just stare and enjoy my date .. I also got the mojito berry bottle 15$ really good and price was reasonable.. I've gotten charged more elsewhere.. meat was just perfect maybe people think it's pricy because of location but i think they deserves it since it super clean and attentive and that's what I love.. will be back and did I mention I was in love with the soybean soup it had a little spice but good enough for me to handle ...."}
{"text":"We were in the mall and just noticed a new spot under the Yelp \"Hot and New\".  We walked over the fountain area and it is next to the Starbucks.  They told us it was opening week, so if you took a picture, you would get 50% off your cocktails.
My husband loves Korean BBQ, so he was excited to try this place.  The menu was a little confusing to me, but mu husband and our server guided me.  We ended up having the small beef combo $64, you choose 4 different cuts of meat, they also brought a Kimchi stew and some egg soup, that looked like a souffle. They will cook the meat for you at your table grill.  My favorite meat was the thinly sliced marinated beef, of course my choice, super yummy.  They have three dip dishes on the side for your meat, soy sauce mix, a spicy sauce and some kind of salt in the other one.  A very interesting experience.  The cocktails are made with Soju, no hard liquor they told me.  They were good and the best part they were 1/2 off."}
{"text":"I have finally found a great korean barbecue spot in Arizona! I was impressed at how good the food is at Sizzle Korean Barbecue. The quality of beef paralleled the excellent barbecue places at Koreatown, LA.  I personally like beef which is not marinated too much, and so I particularly enjoyed the Prime boneless short rib over the marinated prime bulgogi. I love that the server cooked our meat for us which is again how it is done in my favorite korean bbq place in California. The side sauce is delicious, I could eat it with everything. The restaurant itself is a little loud but it is nice, clean and modern. The servers were attentive. Prepare to spend over your budget as this place is a little pricey. There are no barbecue dishes less than $20. Is it worth it you ask? Definitely!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! The ONLY reasons I'm gonna say 4/5: price for the meats, and the lack of any seafood/chx options. I've had Korean BBQ out in Los Angeles and recall, at the very least, having one seafood/poultry option. My husband had to eat 2 beef servings because I don't eat beef/pork and they have a minimum of 2 servings for the Korean BBQ. I ate the kimchi fried rice instead and it was amazing! I highly recommend this place for the carnivores out there. All the kimchi and BBQ sides were crazy good! I think we will go back even though I could only eat the sides ha ha."}
{"text":"Seasoned boneless and the short rib, very tasteful. Kind of tight space but service is good."}
{"text":"Yay...finally Phoenix has a Korean BBQ place! One of my absolute favorite kind of food...kal-bi and bulgogi was super good! And, don't forget about Soju! Good food and drinks...and super nice server! I'll be back very soon.

My only wish list item...stone pot bi bim bap please : )"}
{"text":"Amazing! A must try experience. Finally a Korean BBQ that you can go to and come back again and again.  Our epicurean guide, Dosum, made sure our first visit was exceptional. The GM Nick came to our table to see how we were doing often. The food is so good, once cooked the meat melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Honestly this must be the best Korean BBQ I've ever had. Food, service and ambiance is all wonderful. I am planning on doing this twice a month at least!"}
{"text":"Korean BBQ is a whole experience. I do agree with other yelpers that this might not be the most traditional Korean BBQ set up, as instead of cutting the meat and giving it to you to cook yourself on the built in grill table, they do it for you. Half the fun is doing it yourself, and having to wait for a server to do it for you (and pay more money overall) for it isn't ideal.

The food itself is very good, the marinated meat is much better than the regular unseasoned cuts that they use, but that is to be expected at any Korean BBQ. The sides that they provide are good and plentiful, and their steamed egg is salted to perfection (all 3 times that I've come!). I've sampled some of their cooked items as well, and wasn't very impressed (kimchee fried rice was just ok but nothing to write home about), so would recommend sticking to the grilled meats.

This place is much more expensive than the location and atmosphere warrant, but I suppose you pay a premium for having them cook for you tableside. If it was more moderately priced I would frequent it much more often."}
{"text":"I brought a group of 9 people, only one had Korean BBQ before and we had a great experience! It was everything you could want for a group new to Korean, and our server Brian was outstanding! He made the meal fun and was great staying in top of our needs. Veronica at the from helped us get seated together and was super helpful on picking what to order on the menu. The food was great, but honestly it was the people who made the experience truly remarkable. I am not from Phoenix, and have spent the last week touring local places while on a conference, and I am glad I found this place and I will be back next year!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I was so full I wanted to sleep right afterwards.  This has been a truly awesome dining experience.  Kelly is a totally awesome cook. He is very thorough and precise. For a fun/ romantic evening with your significant other this is the spot."}
{"text":"Very excited about this Korean BBQ opening. They finally had their soft opening this past weekend and it was definitely worth the wait. The true test is first the Galbi...AMAZING! Next, gotta try the quality of the kimchi and see the variety of the side dishes. Kimchi test...passed with flying colors. Top this with contemporary decor and attentive, genuine service and you have a winning combo. Worth a trip for lunch, dinner or even late night fun with drinks! Sizzle is an all-around champion for Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"Concept is there but its not the best. Super pricey food, ordered two $99 combo for 8 people expecting it to be fulfilling but we all left hungry. It would be nice if we get to grill it ourselves and eat at our own pace like other Korean BBQ place but nope. Felt super rushed like we were eating and getting kicked out at the same time. 3 star for friendly service and decent food.

But I guess you're paying for the experience as well. I recommend for everyone to give it a try at least once."}
{"text":"Their Kalbi and bolgogi are great. Excellent service. Little loud for conversations. I was surprised by the freshness of the ingredients. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 steaks, white rice, potstickers and one other meat. It cost $150. I ate almost nothing! Also, they do not have a child's menu. Unless you are an avid Korean food connoisseur I would not recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"1. The serving size could be better.  Among 4 people, we ordered 1 small beef combo (serves 2) and 1 small pork combo (serves 2) for the price of little over $100-$110. We also ordered a few bottles of soju and bowls of rice; total cost: approximately $200. The kimichi and soy bean paste soup could be better too.

2. The menu can be written better to understand the different meats options to choose without the customers having to ask and the staff to explain. 

3. The service is fast pace. It felt like we're being pressured to eat faster. 

My Korean bbq experience was spoiled at Quarters or Baek Jung in Ktown LA. This seems to be the smaller version of Quarters but not quite there yet.  If you can settle for a price range of $30-$40 dollars for your sit down and content portions, this place is for you."}
{"text":"My stud of a boyfriend and I came to Sizzle for date night. Super cool concept, definitely  unique and strangely somewhat confusing if you're new to this. You gotta try things out at least once, right? We did! We were seated right away and served little bowls of Korean sides, probably what they serve with BBQ in Korea. Bowls aren't too big however they give you an idea of all the flavors and textures. We were also plated a nice big salad to share. 

***If you have a hard time with chopsticks, or even if you're a pro, make sure to ask for a fork or spoon because the silver chopsticks, though once again a cool concept were really hard to use - and I'm somewhat decent using chopsticks.***

Anyways, my handsome honey and I ordered prime ribeye and wagyu beef. Cindy was our server and was so-so, not the friendliest server but not the meanest one either. She probably could slow it down to those who visit the restaurant - again, you gotta try things out at least once, right - we were new to this.  Anyways, there really wasn't a schooling on how the process worked but eventually, we figured it out on our own. The meats were indeed cooked to perfection but hang on......

...they don't bring you rice......a Korean restaurant that doesn't give you rice. Sigh. Don't worry, you can order rice for a small fee.

Advice: Order the rice. Can't really eat Korean BBQ without rice, I mean you could but come on.....

Anyways, two orders of meats, two beers came to around 91 bucks. 

For sure try it, great for date night. We probably won't be back but it was indeed an experience."}
{"text":"There was nothing wrong with this place but nothing remarkable either. It is a little more fusion than I prefer so I can't give it a five star for authentic Korean BBQ. The  (side dishes) also left a little something to be desired. The portions were small but the food was ultimately tasty. I am also biased against servers that do not understand the culture of Korean BBQ and Sizzle definitely does a poor job of providing the experience one expects from this type of restaurant. It was an enjoyable enough experience overall even if it was a bit spendy, even for the genre. If I am in the area I might go back to this place, but I am just as likely to try the next Korean joint down the list."}
{"text":"Over priced and not that great. Cool experience but not worth the money. It says 2 $$ for cost but it mute like $$$$."}
{"text":"Okay food, but BAD service. 
1. Chopsticks were sticky
2. No one came to serve us after we told manager twice to bring Menu 
3. Manager did not even say anything to us about such bad experience"}
{"text":"I have been to Sizzle a few times now and my fondness has decreased with each visit. The first couples time I was so excited to have a delicious Korean BBQ in the area and even happier that I did not need to cook for the table. But after a few more times, I realized there is not enough food for how much you are paying; I kept on having the fill up on the free side dishes and salad. And I could easily eat the large Beef Combo by myself, but it is supposed to feed 3-4. 

Pros:
- fun experience having someone cook for you
- marinated beef is delicious
- fantastic steamed egg

Cons:
- not enough food for the cost
- nearly impossible to get a refill for water and banchan (side dish)
- long wait times for a table"}
{"text":"Not the place to go if you are by yourself unless you are willing to buy two entries for the actual BBQ menu. I basically was restricted to the \"side menu\". 

I had the Spicy Stir Fried Squid which was delicious! 

I will come back but wish they offer the BBQ for singles.

BTW, I did find it difficult to find the restaurant. It is in the middle of the outdoor mall."}
{"text":"Located not in Seoul , but in little ol'Phoenix, a great Korean BBQ gem nestled in a outdoor mall. Very authentic Korean, and a great new restaurant addition to our rotation."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner mid-week.  They had the table ready with a small selection of Korean sides prior to seating.  Most of the menu was for selecting a protein to grill at your table, cooked by your server.  The hostess and server were both knowledgeable about gluten-free options, which is helpful since my wife is allergic.  It's somewhat pricey and upscale for Korean food, you can find lower-cost options in Glendale.  But, the flavors of the various kimchis was pretty much spot on for traditional Korean.  Also, had the spicy pork and it was fantastic.  My wife had bibimbap, which was also pretty good, especially the gochujang.  Would be fun for a larger gathering, since you could try more than one type of protein, and they had a large selection.  Everything was a la carte, including rice, except the side dishes, which we were told were included with the protein selection."}
{"text":"Omg! Finally a Korean BBQ place in Arizona close to my house! The food is amazing, staff is amazing, and experience is amazing! I wish the place was bigger because they are always so full but all in all it's a great restaurant! I highly recommend the kimchi (sp?) rice! Love this place and would give it more stars if I could."}
{"text":"I don't know if I'm missing something, but all the flavors seemed bland.  First things first, rice  $2.00 a serving?  Not used to that... I ordered the tofu soup, bland.  All the different kimchees and normal accoutrements had this wierd blandness and lack of spice. I ordered bulgogi and some random pork with no korean name and I wasn't allowed  to cook it myself at our Table top grill.  When our waitress thought it was done she came over and shut the gas off. She even took the tongs out of my hand! To top it all off my bill for 2 ok entrees, 3 smaller servings of normal mean rice, and a very bland tofu soup was over $80. Food 1 star, service 2.5 stars, atmosphere/decor 3stars. Never going back. Sticking to my favorite on 49 ave and tbird: Ohya korean bbq!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this restaurant given the reviews. Our table ordered the large portion of beef to be cooked at our table. The issue was the food tasted of propane and the meat had little flavor. 

We had to ask for rice which is very odd for a Korean restaurant. The egg pot and the soup were also very small servings for large portion we ordered. 

It was def. an experience but I feel there are much better Korean restaurants in the valley and I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First time trying this place ,We went to eat got seated quickly and has a Nice atmosphere, the waitress was nice too . but definitely not a good experience. I was eating the white rice and I had to spit it out because there was a piece of hair in it , I was so grossed out ! The table was dirty as well . you have to get a minimum order of meat and it's over priced as it is . When something like that happens I think they should do more than just taking the rice off the bill .."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch on a Saturday with my wife and three kids. Place wasn't very busy and we were seated right away, though I can see them being at capacity during peak times. Service was attentive, menu is what you would expect, sides and sauces were tasty. My youngest had the beef rib soup, and he gobbled it down. The rest of us split three beef and one pork dish. Each serving is good enough for two, so we ordered maybe one more dish than we should have. About the only down side is that this place is located way at the end of a busy mall (near the AMC)."}
{"text":"First timers at Sizzle. Great friendly service. Kateri was awesome. Food was delicious. A variety of flavors and textures. Pleasantly surprised. Would recommend to anyone looking for something different than the usual."}
{"text":"We had been trying to go forever, but wait times were longer than anticipated. We finally planned correctly. It was well worth the wait. Fantastic food, service, atmosphere. We will definitely be back. We had the beef platter, served in courses. Sauces, toppings, veggies. All great. 

Be prepared to come early and walk around Desert Ridge a bit. But well worth the wait"}
{"text":"We're always down for good Korean food, and this place really sets itself apart. 

For Korean food newbies, this place really shines. The menu is simple, and the staff personally cooks the meat at your table for you, answering any and all questions along the way. The quality is exceptional, especially the seasoned kalbi and bulgogi. Be sure not to miss them! 

The price is a tad stiff, but the quality and service makes it worth it. We live on the other side of town, but will be back again!"}
{"text":"Sizzle Korean BBQ is located in Desert Ridge Marketplace in the Food Court. 

Sizzle Korean BBQ is not for everyone. You have to be a meat eater and you have to be ok with either a Beef or Pork Meal.

Sizzle Korean BBQ serves an all day menu that runs around $25 - $39 for a single BBQ. 

Our server tried to be very helpful and explained the menu to us. She spoke very quickly and had a thick Asian Accent and for me was hard to understand.

We shared a Small Beef Combo BBQ that is five kinds of beef and includes one extra dish of Stew. (We picked Kimchi Stew) ($64)

After we ordered many side dishes (Banchan) arrive. Some were radishes, bean sprout salad, fish cakes, broccoli, onions, green onion salad and tossed salad. They also served condiments for the meat of sea salt, a red sauce they called spicy that wasn't so spicy and kind of ketchup like and soy sauce.

Next we get the appetizer of steamed eggs and our server starts cooking the beefs. We start to try the beefs and she tells us to salt the beef, dip in soy, add onions and green onion salad and use a slice of radish and make a little taco out of it. 

All the beef was delicious. Four out of Five beefs we tried was very tender. (one of the ribs was chewy)

The beef came flying fast at us and it was kinda hard to work in the side dishes.

I didn't get to the appetizer until maybe the third beef. 

For me I would enjoy it more if they could space it out a little bit.

When we got done our server said do you want your complimentary dessert? So I'm thinking maybe it's large or something and that might be why it was a question....It was a sample size of Lemon Gelato. It was a nice sweet ending but would have been nicer if a few of the mountain of used plates were cleared.

Food was very tasty. For me on my visit the Brisket, Boneless Short Rib and Marinated Thin Bulgogi were the most tender and delicious.

The staff all thanked us for dining with them.

This is a place that I will revisit."}
{"text":"OMG... Look no more!!! Hard to find great Korean food here in AZ compared to CA. But SKB didn't disappoint us. We where pleasantly surprised. Our guest were impressed! Their meat is excellent and the service..PERFECTO!! Our girl Megan made sure we had a fantastic experience. In fact, everyone there were very friendly. We live 13 miles away.. we're surely coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Korean place next to my friend's kitchen. I see reviews here about how pricey it is, come on people, get use of the quality vs quantity! Hands down the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant. I was there the second week they were open. I could not eat there because they only serve beef and pork. I don't eat either. Why no poultry, fish, or veggie dishes? If the server is doing the cooking then we don't have to worry about guests undercooking their poultry so I don't  understand it. This owner is alienating a large segment of the population. Please broaden the menu so more people can try your restaurant! Thank you."}
{"text":"Great place!  45 minute wait on a Saturday night, but that's to be expected.  We really enjoyed the food.  Having grown up in Hawaii, I've had a lot of exposure to Korean BBQ and this was up there with the best.  We ordered the large Beef combo and it was more than enough for three people.  Make sure you order the Kimchi rice from the left side of the menu -  Awesome!  The meal was pricey, but you get what you pay for and I believe the value was there.  Friendly staff and great service."}
{"text":"We had the beef combo for two, Korean dumplings, and seafood pancake. The dumplings were outstanding as was the beef. This place is delicious and am so happy to have this option in the far north valley. There is nothing else like it around here.  We will be back. Would love to see better wine offerings."}
{"text":"Coming from Orange County CA where Korean BBQ is top notch. This place really is delish. It's a hidden little gem in desert ridge. The food and atmosphere are great. We have been there a couple times. The only downfall is that they don't take reservations and the restaurant is extremely small so you have to go really early and hope for the best. 4 stars because of that. Will be back."}
{"text":"I was not even aware that I would entertain a place like this, but a friend saw it @ Desert Ridge, and suggested we meet there for lunch.  What a pleasant surprise.  Never having been to a place like this before - the staff walked us through the process and we were all very happy with the outcome"}
{"text":"What an amazing place!  The food and presentation were amazing and it was like I had stepped right back into downtown Seoul.

The bbq at the table with the large array of vegetables, seaweed, dipping sauces and soups started things off.  Then, out came the three different cuts of beef and marinated pork ribs which were cooked up just tight and truly delicious.

My son was very impressed by the food, tastes, and stories my wife and I told about our time in Korea.  My sister, a chef, was asking about ingredient, spices, etc and has made coming back a definite \"must do.\"

Highly recommend going and whenever we ate in Phoenix we will be stopping by."}
{"text":"Sizzle is a very confusing restaurant. When you look at the prices on the menu, you would expect a more upscale restaurant. However, the decor is definitely midscale. I came in with my friend, her young son and her two-year-old daughter. Despite the fact that there were probably only five other customers in the restaurant, it took us about 10 minutes to be seated. Seems like they have to set up a bunch of condiments on the table beforehand. Once we were seated it took probably 10 minutes for a waitress to come over. We ordered soft drinks and our entrees. The side items came first (which complement the entrees) even before our soft drinks which seems weird. Then we got our drinks. Never got any napkins. I will say though that the food was very tasty once it got there. The waitress cooks the food right at your table which was very cool. Seems a little pricey for what we got though, especially considering the décor. The hostess and most of the servers are wearing jeans. They don't really seem to be efficient in their service. Also, the two entrees that I wanted were not available. 4 of us a weekday lunch, the bill was over $100."}
{"text":"My husband and i have been so excited to check this place out. 
Overpriced with small portion, 
Nothing is amazed me since i have been to Korean bbq before with better sauces and sides
Service is great but not familiar and comfortable with someone serving me when i am eating in front of, 
First try and might not be back for bbq, but will try out bimbimbap hot stone maybe
I were gonna give this place 3 stars but feel like the owner is trying hard enough to run this place. So there you go!"}
{"text":"First timer at a Korean BBQ place, Sizzle met my expectations and then some! After watching countless videos of people devouring delicious looking meals on YouTube when they cook their own meal, the server cooked my meal the way I liked it and it was just as tasty as I imagined it to be plus he was extremely polite and educated on what he was serving! Trevor made my experience one to remember and I hope others enjoy it as much as I did. My younger brother and I got the small beef combo (serves two). They gave four cuts of protein; Brisket, Wagyu, Prime boneless shortrib, and the Marinated shortrib, along with the many sides of salad, kimchi, stew, vegetables and rice. My favorite was the prime boneless shortrib. All cuts were juicy and everything tasted fresh but my favorite had the best flavor of the meat in my opinion. At the end, Trevor gave us their limoncello gelato to end the meal in a refreshing way! By far one of my new favorite places and their customer service was more than exceptional!"}
{"text":"Super service, most Korean restaurants ive been to require you to cook your own bbq or hot stone. Our server did it all. Great food, nice atmosphere. A little on the expensive side but thought it was worth the money."}
{"text":"Way overpriced, they charge for a side of white rice, server was awkward and would stand at cooking area for long periods of time (even when she had just come to flip the meat). Food ended up making me sick. The restaurant is decorated very beautiful and modern, but that is all you're paying for...oh and the side of rice."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and really unique food and presentation. Went here for a friend's bday dinner and loved it. Definitely will Be going back"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The interior, the food and the service. The only thing that i didnt like during my first visit was. I ordered the pork belly and the waitress cut it so thick.(i should have asked her to cut it myself)  It should have been thin slices. If we cant cook our food atleast we get to cut them the way we want. The waitress is really good though. She does everything but i think is way too much for her to be cooking from one table to the other."}
{"text":"Sizzle is awesome! This place has it all! An amazing atmosphere, great customer service, and incredible food! I wish I could give 6 stars because this is my favorite date night restaurant now! I recommend the \"Waygu\" which is basically cow bacon and it was delicious! Please check this place out!"}
{"text":"WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS HOW HAPPY I AM TO HAVE FOUND SIZZLE in ARIZONA, a place where only a few Korean restaurants are....AVAILABLE lol. 

Less is more so I shall keep it short. 

Service was excellent. 
Surpassed my high expectations (I'm from LA AND I'm Korean). 
Meat quality was superb. 

The only thing they should work on improving is bussing their tables more quickly so they can shorten the wait for the people waiting to be seated. 

You can order the different cuts of meat a la carte but they also have Combos available:
1. Beef Combo
2. Pork Combo

I ordered the Beef Combo and added an order of the pork belly. It was way too much for just two of us girls but you only live once right? The combos come with other dishes, like the signature steamed egg that's usually served at Korean BBQ restaurants and also a choice of the Korean soup: \"Dwen jang jji geh\" or \"Kimchi jjigeh\". 

Those of you pretty new to the Korean food culture, this will be a great experience for you. Their side dishes were all very delicious and I loved the setup of the restaurant too. 

They have other popular Korean dishes, which realistically I probably won't really get to try because I'll be busy eating the BBQ! :p 

Sizzle, I'll see you probably every weekend!! To the owner: THANK YOU FOR INVESTING AND OPENING THIS PLACE! :]"}
{"text":"1st time at a Korean Bbq. The waitress was great and explained how everything worked! Dumplings were amazing! Sides and sauces are great too"}
{"text":"This place looked kind of interesting from the outside and I was in the mood for some Korean BBQ.  When I enquired about a table, the hostess told me that I had to order by both sides of the menu $60+ of food.  That's quite a bit of food.  On second, I told her I will bring a friend next time so that we could actually eat all the food with a big smikle.

She gave me a snooty look like I don't belong there.  Not sure why this place hires snooty teenagers who think they don't need to be nice.  It's just a job mentality.  If they are going to be rude, they should work in an assembly line and not customer facing.  Get a job flipping burgers at a fast food joint.  They don't know how to run a business here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this is not our first time trying out Korean bbq.  If you are looking for la standards, keep walking!! If you love eating fat more than meat, come here!!! We ordered wagyu, galbi, and bulgolgi. Every single piece of bite was covered in 90% fat!! I'm not even kidding!! It was so bad that grease was splashed into my 8 year old son's eye while the server was cooking the meat!!! He did not apologize to my son until my husband asked him to and he offered him a beverage.  The server told my husband that this happens about once a month. I seriously doubt it! The grill's heat was so high that every piece was burnt (yes, burnt- not the nice char grill).  The grills are only 12 inches away from you and they serve the most fattiest meats. I have never been to a Korean bbq restaurant where grease is splashing from the grill- #1 because the grill is at least 24 inches away from you and #2 they don't serve fatty cuts of meat!
Ugh! Stay away!!"}
{"text":"The food at this place was absolutely delicious. We went on a Friday night and had no problem getting a table for a party of 5 even though it was pretty busy. Service was fast and the food was incredibly tasty and cooked to perfection.  We ordered the beef family meal for 4 with 4 different meats and a kimchi soup. We also ordered a serving of pork belly and 3 servings of steamed rice.   The kimchi soup was spicy and sour and so delicious.  All the different pickles and palate cleansers and sides that come with Korean BBQ were really flavorful and good too. 

I had to give only 4 stars because the server didn't seem to want to be bothered with questions or explain the differences in the meats or anything about how to eat Korean BBQ.  She was kinda nice but not too friendly. It's a very new dining style to some people and my family had never tried it before.  She barely answered our questions about the alcohol choices. It just  seemed like she wanted us in and out as fast as possible and didn't want to be bothered with customer service. 

All in all I would definitely return to this place!  It was excellent."}
{"text":"The food is great, it tastes like REAL local korean food, BUT the service (one of the female Korean staffs) was terrible. They didnt even ask once about what I ordered is good or so, but I still had to give them 15 % tips u know... :( I dont know why she pretends to NOT understand Korean(like typical Korean attitude)!  It's funny to say that but this korean restaurant is Not a restaurant for Korean customer(would not recommend to my friends!)"}
{"text":"Came across this place while we were walking towards the food court at Desert Ridge and couldn't resist checking out a new Korean restaurant for lunch. We were greeted by the hostess, she could definitely put a little more work into her hair and outfit, she sets the tone for the experience and it was not all that great.  We were asked if we were going to grill, however, we chose to skip the grilling and just order items off the menu. We were seated and waited... and waited... and waited for a server to greet us; may I mention the 2 servers were just standing around chatting to the hostess. Finally, a woman dressed in all black (perhaps the manager) greeted us and took our order. She also delivered most of our food along with one server. We were never checked on and had to grab someone every time we needed something (napkins, more food, clean silverware, etc). On top of that, the silverware and glassware just looked grungy and dirty.  I am very disappointed in our dining experience.  The food wasn't all that bad, just pricey, especially when the service was as bad as it was and for lunch."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Sizzle with my parents and girlfriend after many recommendations from friends.

This particular KBBQ place has your server cut and grill the meat for you. I generally do not have a problem with this but when you're only going to cook one of the meats and then walk away for several minutes, it's frustrating. After our server (Lindsay) cooked our brisket, we finished eating it within a minute and had to wait ~5mins before she came back to start the next round. Keep in mind, the uncooked meat is sitting at our table doing nothing. We decided to put some of the meat on the grill to speed up the process, which is common in your traditional KBBQ to grill yourself, and Lindsay was clearly annoyed and offended by it and started to give us attitude for the rest of the meal.

Here comes the best part: Once I received my bill, she had mentioned that gratuity was automatically included. I thought it was odd because I only had 4 people in my party. I went ahead and checked on their menu and to my surprise it said \"Parties of 5 or More\" gratuity will be automatically added. I decided to ask Lindsay (our server) why was my table charged when it clearly states 5 or more. She said that her manager decided to do it. I then asked to speak with her manager (Julie) and questioned why it was decided that my party of 4 would have it automatically charged and she said that Lindsay had requested it done! UNBELIEVABLE! I asked both of them why, why would they do that? No answer, literally shoulder shrugs and silence. The manager could do nothing but just apologize and wrote her name on the card and said that next time she will provide better service. No thanks. I will never be going back.

Would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Poor service, poor management."}
{"text":"Wish we were allowed to do the cooking... otherwise the sides are great and hot bowl bi bim bap are great. Marinated short ribs are awesome. Atmosphere is great nice, neat and clean."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice and both times had great times. Quick and friendly service. Food quality was excellent and most importantly, they tasted delicious."}
{"text":"Great place!  Place was clean.  They have smoke hoods that come down and control the smoke!!  The server cooks the food on the grill which makes it more relaxing then you cooking."}
{"text":"10/ 10 the best Korean restaurant Ive ever been to (California included) love the BBQ kimichi fried rice and strawberry basil soju! Best soju ever!"}
{"text":"Located in Desert Ridge Marketplace..this is a delicious spot to dine.  I have been here a few times and each experience have been excellent.   

I highly recommend the potstickers - thick, fresh and delicious!

Take your time and enjoy all the wonderful flavors of side dishes and meat.  The Galbi is very good.  It is a marinated short rib and the meat is very tender and flavorful..and the leftovers are even better the second day at home.  The Kimchee rice is good too!

Their staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ fans can now indulge at Sizzle. This recent addition the plethora of restaurants in Desert Ridge is a welcome addition. 
The dining experience includes the typical tabletop grills so that you eat as your food is cooked right in front of you. Most Korean BBQ places let the patrons cook themselves. Here the server does that for you. For some reason I prefer doing it myself. 
We ordered the beef combination which the menu says is for 3-4 people. We found it to be plenty for 5 adults and 2 children. The quality of the meat was superb and that is so important. The combination was an assortment of 4 different cuts and each one was tender and tasty. The accompaniments, an integral part of the Korean BBQ experience, were fresh and did justice to the BBQ. 
Now you may ask why only 3 stars. Eating at 5 star restaurants, for me, is a blend of great food and great service. This is where Sizzle fell quite short of the mark. We arrived just as they opened and we requested a table for seven. Three of us were there and the others were on their way. As soon as the table was ready those of us there proceeded to seat ourselves. One of the staff asked us to wait until the entire group was present. What? 
The server did not bother to replenish our water and at least twice we had to hunt him down. 
So 2 stars for poor hospitality."}
{"text":"So.. I'm from Korea and I miss the taste of the food from my home country, a lot.
I've visited almost every Korean bbq restaurants existing in Phoenix area.
And I would like to say, among those, this place is the best. 
These days, I'm visiting this place at least once a week, Usually 2~3 times a week.

At the first few visit, I was unfamiliar with someone cooking my meat for me at the table, (we usually cook ourself at bbq restaurant in Korea, and also someone standing in front of my table was bothering lol) but when I asked if I can cook the meat myself, the server said \"why not? but I can't guarantee the taste\" lol.
I just love the taste of foods here and the shaved Ice with fruits they got as a dessert.


Quality
I would like to say the quality of the foods here are the best. Especially the meats are beyond words. And of course the taste follows the quality.

Price
Is reasonable for me, I usually get Beef combo for two ppl with my friend and it's like around $40 per person including tip. (Considering my substitutes for the Sizzle Korean bbq, are Mastro/ Steak 44/ Dominick's, where the price is around $70 per person)

Waiting
Usually there is waiting at the dinner peak time (which means this place is that much GOOD lol)

Service.. 
well.. I understand that servers here have to get orders, serve, cook and.. so I don't expect much for the service lol, but I still like it! They are all kind and trying to do something for me :)"}
{"text":"I was so excited about new Korean BBQ opened up in Scottsdale/north Phoenix area. 

Came here for lunch the other day and thought not too bad for north Phoenix.

What nice about this place is that a trained server cooks meat for you at a grill on your table, where normally we cook on our own.  In face she was very well trained, she cooked our beef so perfectly.

BBQ for two comes with four different types of meat. A half of what I picked were good but the other half, I though guy I had better cut if beef before.

Banchan quality was just okay. I would have enjoyed more fishy and spicy taste.

We came here to talk, but fan and grill in the middle, as well as a server being there wasn't too appropriate for talking privately.  Overall I had better cut of meat before but I am glad that now we have BBQ in this part of city."}
{"text":"This is our third visit and food is still very good 4 or 5 but very rushed trying to serve as many people as possible.  One item I did not notice till tonight but the napkins are only 4 x 4 cheap paper.   For what they charge just not a nice experience as it once was do not recommend anymore. There are better in the valley try Soul Phoenix"}
{"text":"Very confusing. Came here for a birthday dinner. A bunch of bowls with pre-prepped food already on the table. We asked the server how does this work? Were  told we need to order our entrees, so no explaination? Each entree is cooked individually so as mine was cooked first, I was finished eating before my wife's food was cooked. We should have ordered the dinner for 2 but were not advised. I gave it 2 stars as the food was really good otherwise it would have been 1 star."}
{"text":"Sizzle was delicious! Brian was our server and he was quick and informative as he cooked our food and talked with us. Highly recommend if you are a meat eater! All food was fresh and delicious. My husband and I ordered the Beef Combo for two. We had our choice of four different types of beef and all were very fresh and tasty. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Live by the area so decided to check out the new Korean BBQ place inside the Desert Ridge Mall by Slices. 
Environment was bright and every table was packed. They play very loud music.  Got a table on the side and felt it was the perfect amount of space. 
The meat was good and very flavorful. They made it very clear you are not allowed to cook the meat yourself. They cook it at the table for you. It wasn't very interactive and they cook it and move on. 
Overall though definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The beef I ordered was very fatty.  Service was extremely slow.  Didn't ask us anything after food came.  Had to get waitresses attention to get a togo box and the check.  Didn't get everything we ordered and they finally adjusted the bill.  No thanks."}
{"text":"My wife and I were both very excited to try out Sizzle. Other than a trip to Hawaii, I haven't had Korean BBQ since I lived in Los Angeles. We are always looking for something new and interesting for date nights, and since we live in the area, we frequently eat at Desert Ridge. 

We tried stopping by on a Saturday night. We were told there would be about a 15 minute wait even though there were a minimum of 6 empty tables out of about 20 total in the place. OK, fine. 15 minutes.  Well, 30 minutes later we get word that our table is ready and they want to seat us right next to the front door, which is a very awkward area with no room for people to stand when they walk in except up against that very table.  We requested the next one over from the door (there were plenty of empties tables to choose from). 

There was an array of condiment/appetizer dishes laid out on the table. Mostly identifiable as various combinations of sprouts, kimchi, cucumbers and such. We quickly realized, based on the menu prices, that they were quite proud of their meat cuts. I asked for clarification about their beef combo and our waitress gave a long circular explanation that didn't seem to answer my question. So I figured I would just pick out one of the $25 meat cuts for my wife and I to split. She said you need at least two meats to turn on the table BBQ. I see...OK, so we picked another $35 cut. We also order some Korean Dumplings that came out on a hot iron plate (which were quite good, by far the best part of the experience) We looked around for napkins and only saw a couple bar naps on the table, so we asked to have some. Of course, we were then delivered additional bar naps. Ah, so those are your napkins of choice, I see.  

As we were finishing up the dumplings, our waitress came over and fired up the grill. She walks away and returns with our raw meats.  I am so excited to cook up some meat. Our waitress then proceeds to pull down a smoke vent, and to our surprise, began placing pieces of meat on the grill. She turns and says \"We have to cook it, I know it's a little different\". Uh, yeah...that is, at the very least, a little different. Now we have this awkward period of silence where time stood still for about 10 minutes as we just stare from each other to the cooking meat and back at each other while our semi-incompetent waitress stands over us, cooking.  

Even their website is misleading \"It begins by choosing from a selection of the best local meats available; then cook it up on a traditional Korean grill, right at your table!\"..Is there anyone that doesn't think that sounds like you cook it yourself?!?
http://sizzlekoreanbbq.com/"}
{"text":"Would not recommend. We walked out because of poor service,awful smell, and overpriced food."}
{"text":"The service is soooooo bad!!!!!!! We told the guy we wanted to cook by ourself, but that doesn't mean we don't need service. At the beginning, he did provided fair service and changed the side, after 6:30pm when people started to came, our server never talked to us, never asked if we need anything . We wanted to order something more, I had to find the manager and waited for 15mins, NOBODY came. WE are here to eat, not to wait! I complained to the manager, he replied \"you said you want to do it by yourself\". Well, I guess just don't say it ANYMORE. Because that means you will get no service, no water, no side, no more order! 

My first one star at Yelp. NOT COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"Read a previous posted review that highly rated and concur.  Had the Tongue & Marinated Pork Short Rib shared with one of my snowbird relatives which was more than enough for a couple of hearty eaters.  Side dishes traditional kimchee, seaweed, etc. and lettuce for the less adventurous."}
{"text":"First time trying this new kbbq. Lots of seating, excellent ventilation system (no typical kbbq smells on clothes) and easy to find location at Desert Ridge.

Now the reasons for two stars:
- food was okay, beef was good quality but side dishes were lacking of the typical Korean fare. 
- you weren't allowed to grill your own meat and were at the mercy of a hovering waiter who stood there awkwardly flipping the meat on the grill. This resulted in some beef not charring nicely but just turning gray. Not cooked to our liking.
- service was BAD. Server was not friendly and did a poor job of explaining the menu; even after we told him we were first timers. Then, when the check came we noticed an unexpected charge, we asked for clarification and were given a rude and inconsiderate explanation. Overall, really unfriendly but other staff seemed really friendly and accommodating.

It's unfortunate our experience was so poor mainly due to our server. Customer service is so important to any small business, especially the food industry."}
{"text":"The food was fine, although the bulgogi was on the small side of a portion imo. Barely enough for two people which doesn't jive with my idea of family style Korean BBQ. The server was even gracious enough to answer my terribly broken Korean question about a side that I liked. 

The only thing I severely disliked about the restaurant was that they had a MINIMUM SPEND on food. I just wanted to split some bulgogi with my boyfriend but they said we had to order two sides. Apparently two sides of rice also aren't an option. Or the mandu, or mandu soup. I was like, well what can we order? We ended up getting some spicy tofu soup which, while tasty 100% went in the to go container because we didn't want it in the first place! Terribly confused and ended up spending $50+ just for lunch..."}
{"text":"Great PHX place.  Nice restaurant located in the middle of an outdoor shopping mall.  The place gets a little loud but they have good meat selections, and a fun atmosphere.  I would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"This place was amazing but EXPENSIVE! For two types of meats and three beers we spent a hundred bucks including tip. I've never been to a Korean BBQ place that was so expensive! The meats are really good though as are the sides. And unlike most Korean BBQ places, your server cooks it for you. It was kind of weird at first and kept trying to cook it myself but whenever she saw me she'd come and take over before finally telling me she would cook for us. Service was great, food was great! Just be prepared to spend more."}
{"text":"I got Prime Rib which was $38 and nothing comes with it besides salad. The meat was not cooked the way I asked. The waitress was trying to serve it to me while it was totally raw inside. I tried a piece and that was all I could eat. They were not apologetic and didn't even offer anything in exchange or did they took any money off my bill. I spend $45 on a meal that I could have bought at Panda Express for $6. Very disappointed. Will never go back nor would I recommend this place to anyone. Oh, & after I told them I did not eat and did not like it, they asked me if I wanted to take it home...it is like they don't listen. The waitress girl was not attentive & it was bit awkward having her stand over our table cooking the meat.  My friend & I told her we never been there and she didn't explain anything just started to cook under the little fire thing. It is great concept but that is the only good thing I have to say about that place. Don't waste you money! If you want to spend that kind of money go somewhere like Fogo De Chao for the steak."}
{"text":"I have been to many Korean BBQ dining experiences (AZ, CA, and in Hong Kong).  I found their whole concept confusing (read on).  We waited about 20 minutes and was greeted by the host. We sat in the grilling section. The table was already set up with side dishes & salad. It came with a free steamed egg. 

We started eating sides then server came by.  Apparently, the grill seating section required 2 meat orders or combo with no exception (no where did I see that and we were not informed).  My friend didn't want to eat meat.  Then we were told there is a non-grilled seating section option. The server indicated that the host should have asked us.  We don't recall the host mentioning anything at all. Absolutely confusing! 

Finally, the server allowed us just order one meat selection.  Normally, the server just cut the meat and not grills the meat for you.  The server was standing around grilling it, I see why the high prices.  I rather grill it myself, that is the true Korean BBQ experience. The constant interruption with the server grilling the meat was annoying. Can't really have a conversation."}
{"text":"I had the spicy squid stir fry (AMAZING) and a glass of red wine. Plus Korean Dumplings and the sides.

Amazing service, amazing food. Truly a magical meal."}
{"text":"I'm so glad a Korean bbq opened up in this area! The staff is amazing and the food is even more so! There isn't any Korean restaurants near by so they are definitely dominating the area."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Go all out. Try four meats. You'll leave full and satiated. Spend the money. It's worth it. Ask them to cook it like it's best. That's good advice! They will also tell you how the Korean's eat it if you ask. If you want a quiet dinner to chat with your friends or family, this may not be the place. I say this because your server is there cooking for you the entire time. I'm sure some can blend out, but we like to talk to people about themselves, so we did that. Obviously nobody had ever asked her about her and her culture - because we made a friend for life. That's not a bad thing at all - just not always up everyone's alley!"}
{"text":"The wife and I were simply let down by this place. It seemed to have good reviews and the two of us were craving KBBQ, so we decided to check it out. This is easily the most expensive KBBQ place I have ever visited, was definitely shocked at the prices for what little you get. We are originally from the greater Los Angeles area, so perhaps we are a bit more used to having a variety of KBBQ choices, as there are many within the area. Additionally, I have lived in South Korea, so perhaps I expect more from my KBBQ. However, I tried to give this place a fair shot, it just was a complete let down. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 stars because this is one of the best tasting Korean BBQ in Arizona. But it is just too pricey for the amount and quality of food we were getting.  You can get the same kind of stuff in California for $30/person, but here it's like $60/person.  Plus it's really annoying to have the server around you cooking the meat all the time."}
{"text":"Newer restaurant, but the location is pretty obscure. The quality is great, fitting its higher price range. The employees were courteous and kind. The downside is that is that it's hard to communicate with friends because the hood above the table is inconveniently placed."}
{"text":"Grand opening. Went for dinner before my movie. By myself so Korean BBQ not good option but great non BBQ menu. Two kinds of bi bim bap--one on sizzle stone, one more a room temp version already arranged in bowl. I had latter & it was great. Rice perfect--fresh, soft and sticky and hot. Korean black raspberry wine sweet and fruity--good for hot spicy garlicky food. Love the assortment of home made pickley it"}
{"text":"First impression? Well, let's just say that when we called to ask for the exact location, the hostess told us it's between AMC and Starbucks.  This is false.  They are located past Starbucks around a slight bend that hides their very small sign that was only half lit.  After walking in and getting our name on the waiting list, he hostess asked us to wait outside IN THE POURING RAIN!  Hospitality was completely lacking and management needs to work with the hostess.

Wait staff was good, but not personable at all. Attempted to ask a few questions, and responses were curt and well, let's just say they had no interest in the customer.  Especially the Asian woman in black.  Seemed like she was management by the way she continuously scowled at her staff and hostess.

Here's the silver lining: the Asian gentleman in the gray Sizzler outfit.  Seemed like the head chef?  Maybe.  But he really saved the evening.  Professional, attentive, and a nice guy.  The rest of the staff was severely lacking any personality, especially given the uptempo atmosphere they were attempting to garner with their Korean videos and music.

The food was good.  But when the server's hands are shaking as he cut the meat, it was a bit unnerving.  Otherwise, the food was good.

Owners/MGT should recognize opportunities to make a solid impression with their customers.  This MGT failed to do so."}
{"text":"I was happy to find this place on Yelp while desperately trying to avoid having to dine at the usual chain-y places in CityNorth (which my g.f. wanted to go to) last night.  It's been almost a year since I last had Korean BBQ with clients and although I love Takamatsu, it's just too far away from where I am in NE Phoenix and not in the bestest of areas.  

Anyway, although located in one of the small retail spaces along the eastern (AMC) end of Desert Ridge Mall, the space is thoughtfully designed and laid out.  They don't accept reservations, so that was a bit of a challenge on a Saturday night, but fortunately the S.O. got there and put our name in while I was still busy getting lost looking for it.  At 7:00 p.m., the place was bustling and, judging by all of the passers by looking into the floor to ceiling windows like we were fish in a bowl, it probably has no reason to take reservations.  I took it as a good sign that there were Koreans also dining there!  My girlfriend got seated at a wall table for four.  She ordered the berry mojito, which she said was a bit watered down, while I ordered a CASS, which came out in those big 40 oz. bottles I do love so.  For our entree, we went with the safe bet and ordered the beef bulgogi to share.  Unfortunately, our very nice (and, I must assume, Korean) waitress was a bit hard to understand, and so we kind of stumbled our way through on our own before realizing that she was telling us that we also had to order a side in addition to the entree. I almost ordered an extra entree by mistake, thinking that's what was required.  

One of the things I like about Korean BBQ (in my very limited experience with it), are all the cool little salads and condiments that are laid out in front of you before the main event even begins.  And Sizzle did not disappoint on that score.  There were probably nearly a dozen different things laid out on the table in advance, from your staple kimchee, to pickled chilis, bean sprouts, radishes, stewed potatoes, and even just a basic mixed greens salad, oh and this egg soufle type thing, which my date really liked.  In short, there is a bit of sticker shock, however there was a lot of food.  The bulgogi portion itself was pretty decent and had good flavor and was plenty for the two of us (and I can put it away, mind you).  My only gripe with it was that it was a bit too fatty for my liking, certainly in comparison to Takamatsu.  Had I been cooking it myself (which I will next time when the waitress' back is turned), I would've spread it out on the grill a bit more and let some more of the fat get rendered off but, all in all, it was good.  Dinner was pricey but, it is KBBQ and it is Scottsdale, after all.  

So is Sizzle my fave Korean BBQ place that I've been to?  No. Is it convenient to get to and a fun evening for something exotic and different?  Absolutely.  I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if Sizzle was a franchise.  The place gets high marks for its very trademark-able name, decor and design aesthetics (the individual drop down hood/fans are genius), and solid organization in churning out product in a very busy and high-paced environment.  I saw a few female customers fanning themselves due to the heat, but I didn't feel uncomfortable temperature wise and thought there was enough A/C going.  I joked with the girlfriend beforehand that we should both wear something disposable since we would both reek of KBBQ by the night's end, however, the place and table was well ventilated and I think I can hang on to my favorite shirt for now. 

As far as suggestions go, while both my parents are immigrants, and I have nothing but respect for people who come over to a new country and have to communicate with natives in a foreign language AND in a demanding retail setting, I would maybe recommend perhaps having some sort of instruction sheet or card on each table for newbies or perhaps assigning someone who is Korean American or even just fluent in English to quickly give patrons a run-down of how things work.  Other than that, I look forward to trying the pork dishes next time!"}
{"text":"Fantastic quality of food! I would go back any time for the galbi (also my favorite at the owner's other restaurant, Nori Sushi) and also the brisket was amazing! If you are not familiar with Korean BBQ be patient because it is definitely a different kind of dining experience but is fun for get togethers or date nights!"}
{"text":"This is simply to die for. Authentic KBBQ experience here in the desert that is genuine throughout! I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try something out of their traditional comfort zone. I promise you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was good, especially the amount of the side dishes, but the price was high.  We went for lunch and were disappointed that they don't offer lunch menu.  For two people and have to order 2 types of meat for the BBQ at lunch, just weren't going to be worth it for us.  We got other items from the menu and had a good lunch.  I guess, this is made for groups.  One down side to the set up is that the vent is so low that when my husband and I tried to have a conversation, we had to tilt our heads to see each other."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance & set up. The side dishes were on point, but they could have been more generous with the meat portions."}
{"text":"I have had my fair share of Korean barbecue dining experiences since I started eating Korean food in high school because my neighbors were Korean and they owned a restaurant themselves. My first time, I fell in love and still think it is one of my favorite Asian cuisines. Unfortunately, good Korean restaurants in the Phoenix area are spread thin and when I heard about this new restaurant in town, I got excited. 

The restaurant is in the Desert Ridge Marketplace. There wasn't very many people dining and my first impression is that it's because of the fancy and expensive menu and prices while the restaurant decor and ambiance doesn't seem to quite match it. It looks like a casual, quick spot with no catchy decor so of course you immediately expect inexpensive prices.

We asked for a table and they had us wait for 5-7 minutes even though there wasn't very many people in the restaurant because they wanted to put all the little side dishes out first. We decided to order the small beef combo and you get to pick four different meats. We decided on the kimchi stew with brisket, boneless short rib, marinated short rib, and marinated thinly sliced beef. We also had to order white rice which was extra.  We practically ate everything and we were full but not full enough. The taste? It's meh. 

Our server actually cooked the food for us which is unusual. We normally cook the food ourselves in other establishments. The prices too are higher than other Korean BBQ restaurants I've been to especially for the portions you get. Our total bill with tip was almost $100!! 

I'm not a fan. Expensive prices, small portions, a boring atmosphere/ambiance = no thanks."}
{"text":"The food here was ok, but for the prices, the portions were way too small. There are many Korean restaurants out there that don't rip you off with pricing. If the food was excellent I'd be more accepting of the prices but for average food and average service, will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Korean BBQ in the area and likely all of Phoenix. If you're looking for a truly amazing experience this is where it will be. The wait staff are fun and engaging, as well as knowledgeable and friendly! The food itself is fabulous and delicious. If it were even just the side dishes this would be worth the trip but when you add the main courses to this meal it's really something special. If I could rate this higher I would!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food is fantastic, HOWEVER I don't believe I'll be coming back here ever again. 
The wait wasn't too long when I was there (about 30min) but I can't imagine waiting any longer than that for overpriced bbq. 
The prices are so high. You have to pay for each type of meat you order (~$20 each) And if you get a combo you have to choose between beef or pork. Rice not included, extra charge. Yes the food is delicious but this place is definitely a one time try type place or if you have money to spare, come back again if you don't mind long wait times at a dying shopping center. 
This review might sound negative but I've just had better experiences at cheaper Korean bbq places even if the quality wasn't as great as it was here."}
{"text":"Wowowowowow food coma! This place comes the closest to being just as good as LA or OC! It's not \"ayce\" and it's a bit more expensive but GUYS... quality over quantity!!! Their small combo portion honestly could feed 3 people, even though it says 2. The seasoned boneless short rib is my absolute favorite! And I like the Kimchi soup too. One thing that should be noted is that the server cooks your food for you at your table. I know at most kbbq restaurants you cook it yourself (and it's fun), but I've never had anyone here do a bad job or make my experience awkward. It's fine. Let them do it while you relax and have a drink! And DO NOT shower right before you come!"}
{"text":"So I come to have lunch or dinner here like twice a month and specially today food was like always and even more delicious I order the kimchi soup and my server Lina was the best servers of all times."}
{"text":"This place is seriously good. High quality meat and very tasty side dishes. Koreans will love this place."}
{"text":"Based off of the past Yelp reviews my husband and I decided to take a 40 minute drive a try this place out.  I have had great experiences going to Korean BBQ places in Seattle and this place fell way short. First, they sat 6 of us at a table that would have fit 4 comfortably, 5 would have been okay, but 6 was way too tight ( they don't have large tables to accommodate parties of 6 or more). Next, there is a typical table set up with salad, kimchi, pickled cucumbers etc.. as I watched other tables get set up for other guests before they were seated, I had to ask to get them for our table, they shorted us on different 5 items, it felt like every time I asked them for something missing I was inconveniencing them. 

We had initially asked if it was okay if we cooked our own food, I guess that meant that it was okay for the waiter to ignore our table unless we flagged him down. 

After all the back and forth, the manager was standing around looking at all the tables and not once did she come over and ask how things were. 

Service was horrible, food was mediocre for the price and time wasted, we will never return. If giving \"0\" stars was an option that is what I would give."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had a world of difference in the experiences. 

My first visit I came with a female colleague and we sat at a grill table and enjoyed wine and amazing food and service. Was so happy decided to return with my husband a couple weeks later. 

My second visit, we came for a light lunch because we had a long day and not much time. We asked for a non-grill table and were promptly informed that means we can't have meat, I said ok because I wanted the Bibimbap anyway. We were seated and our waitress came over and stood there looking at my husband and I but not saying much, we asked for 2 orders of bibimbap, and before we could even talk about drinks, she walked away. It wasn't a busy afternoon where she was rushing from table to table, she just seemed uninterested in our presence and slightly annoyed at having to help a table that only wanted bibimbap. We received our food, delicious, which was consistent with my first experience, but the waitress never returned except to drop the check off and walk away, without even looking at us. 

I don't know whether it's an issue with a gay couple having a meal together that she disliked, or if it was the assumption that the price of our meal wouldn't command a huge tip and thus we didn't warrant courtesy or respect. 

As much as the food here delights the palate, the latest experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and I won't be returning. I would've given one star, but the food is actually good, I just don't feel the need to pay to be insulted."}
{"text":"We enjoyed ourselves. The meat was cooked appropriately and everything was delicious. We would return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful. My wife and I discovered it months ago and it has never left our mind. We have never been so happy about visiting a restaurant. We ordered beef and pork and although the waiter was there to prepare the food over the grill however since I am a chef, he let us do our own thing. The food was of high quality and bought to the table at the right temperatures. We were able to enjoy and savor every bite. The waitstaff was accommodating to our every wish. The interior is comfortable and modern and relaxing. The grill at the table has the best ventilation I have experienced in a Korean bbq restaurant. I recommend this to anyone who wants to have an unforgettable experience eating Korean bbq."}
{"text":"Really poor service!!! We said we want to cook by ourself and since then no one stop by and check on us!! Manger is crude! First time and last time."}
{"text":"The food was AMMMAAAAZZZING, but mucho extra points for the experience!!! I love how you get to see the food prepared at your table. The sight of the grill at the middle and the assortment of exotic ingredients brought out and arranged on the table was a huge part of the enjoyment. It isn't the kind of culinary experience I typically have, so it made it all the more special. The quality of the meats and the service provided were top notch. A great place to enjoyment with others. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale for Annual conference, craving for korean bbq.  We walked in a bit confuse with how they seat people. We ordered the all beef large combo. Pretty good and a lot of meats."}
{"text":"Korean Food, asian food, good korean food... in Arizona... especially in Scottsdale is a rarity. Sizzle offers everything for the foodie/food snob. Korean Food is expensive in general, and usually gets put into BBQ... but Sizzle elevates korean food while keeping authentic Koran flavors. Just a heads up, it is extremely expensive compared to most korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Great service! A little confusing the first time on how to order but they are very helpful! So good!!!"}
{"text":"Had many meals here and spent a lot of time in so cal korean bbq places. I must admit the meat quality is very good, I would say it's a legit korean bbq house.  Make sure you try the dessert, either the red bean, but the strawberry is excellent and refreshing."}
{"text":"It pains me to give a bad review. The food was pretty good. At least what I had. I'll explain.

I've been meaning to go check out this restaurant because I miss my Korean food. I was excited to see both this restaurant and Ohya open up within a couple miles from work. 

I was watching the UFC fight and they open late so I thought I'd get a midnight snack. Went in and expected that they would cook the meat for me in the back since I was by myself but they said there was a minimum order of 2 people's worth of meat to order meat at all. 

Now most Korean BBQ places will cook a single serving in the back and bring it out. But they still let you order it. Nowhere on the menu did I see a minimum order requirement. Quite frustrating. It's not like it was super busy so they couldn't give me the attention. I was the only diner in there at the time. 

Looking at the menu I was surprised at the cost of the meat. Since I was not allowed to order said meat I can't comment on the quality of the meat, but it is clearly overpriced. Ohya offers all you can eat (with sushi) for $25. Even their combos are about $40-50. I guess Desert Ridge has a premium on rent but I hope they didn't price themselves out. 

Since I was there I did order the  (cold radish noodle soup). I crave this often but always compare it to The Corner Place () in LA. It wasn't as good but was still good and I could see this being a lifesaver in the hot summer here. 

The  (side dishes) were good and I will say they were better than Ohya. I was never offered seconds when I ran out as well. Since I wasn't ordering a bunch of meat I guess I can understand but service is service. What did I expect from a place that charges you for rice!  

I'm torn writing this review. I think they have potential and hopefully appeal to the trend of KBBQ. I will have to give them another chance but wasn't impressed with my initial visit."}
{"text":"Coming from Portland, Oregon, I consider myself a foodie, and this passes my food snob test.

If you want to be cheap, don't come here. If you want excellent food that's priced according to what you receive, you can't go wrong.

Best Korean food I've ever had. I personally had the Dolsot Bibimbap this time, but the neighboring tables with Korean BBQ looked amazing. The quality of the meat looked superb, and all ingredients extremely fresh.

The service was great, all the staff seemed happy, great atmosphere, and the late night hours are awesome. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad Korean food for Scottsdale. Came here on Friday for lunch and it was no problem to get a table.

Service was good and this is a place that good for a group since the portion is a bit big.
I enjoyed everything except the prime boneless short rib, it was very chewy.

I will comeback here again for sure."}
{"text":"I happen to pass by this korean restaurant and i did not notice it was even there until i found it through yelp. This is typical korean bar-be-que place and it was quite nice one. The manager, Jullie, was very pleasant and the service was great. The side dishes were tasty and handful. We ordered marinated beef and it was quite good. I would not say it is the best, but it was pretty good enough that i would want to go back. It is bit pricey, but it is good if u come once awhile. :)"}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ I have ever had! The beef platter for two is delicious; amazing meat quality. We also ordered a jiggae, rice and steamed eggs to share.. all were really yummy! I wasn't that happy with the banchan variety but that's because I make better ones at home. My favourite restaurant in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"It's very expensive but the meat is good quality and the food is pretty close to authentic so it makes it worth it. I wasn't expecting good quality Korean food in the middle of the U.S. but so thankful this place is here. I'm used to LA Korean BBQ, this place is more boogie and the quality of the food makes it worth your buck. The waitress is very very kind."}
{"text":"Finally, a Koreatown style BBQ house in AZ! I ordered the combo for 2 for 64 dollars and I think it's enough to feed at least 3! It includes your choice of 4 different kinds of meat, and a stew. We chose thinly sliced brisket, prime rib eye, Wagyu beef belly and marinated short ribs. The staff cook the meat for you right in front of your eyes! Not to worry, each table has their own ventilation system. The quality of the meat is amazing! All of their side dishes and steamed egg were marinated to perfection! I'm super excited to say they open late daily and serve Korean alcohol as well. I'm pretty excited about this new hangout spot!"}
{"text":"Good place.  Really authentic and a LOT of food."}
{"text":"My brother and I have been here twice, and we've had a great experience both times. Korean BBQ is one of our favorite things, and we've come here to celebrate. The staff is friendly, professional, and accommodating, but the star of the show is the quality of the meat.

We went for the Prime Rib Eye and Berkshire Black Pork Belly the first time we came, and I think that's going to be our go to combo. The sides are varied and interesting, and I particularly enjoy the complimentary steamed egg that comes with the meal.

The hoods they employ do a great job of keeping the table smoke free. it's nice to enjoy the experience of Korean BBQ and come away not smelling like I've just sat next to an open fire for 40 minutes.

It's a busy place, but they do a great job of keeping things running smoothly. You can expect a bit of a wait for a table in peak times (we've had to wait ~20 minutes on Friday nights for a table), but it's not the end of the world. It's worth it for the food."}
{"text":"Pros: My husband (native Korean) and I have had Korean BBQ all over this country together. While traveling to Phoenix, we looked up several places at decided on this one because of the great Yelp reviews. Easily the second best Korean BBQ I have had in the US. We had friends with us who had never tried Korean BBQ before and they completely loved it. Ordered the beef meal and added a few pork dishes al la cart.  Usually, we like unmarinated meats best, but that was not the case at this place. The marinated ones were amazing. The service was very good and they staff do all the cooking (thank goodness). Average price of other places. 

Cons: We did have a difficult time finding it since it wasn't visible from the parking lot and google maps wasn't clear on which shopping center it was in."}
{"text":"Very good tasty Korean food.  All of the different flavored meats were cooked at the table of your party.  Kinda like a Benny Hana style with all Korean flavor.  Also had their spicy soup which was so tasty but spicy.  I recommend sitting at a larger table for two as they came out surrounding the main burner with close to 12 side dishes.  Plus we had to make room for our order and condiments.  You definitely will walk out full.

A very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical when i realized the restaurant was located in the mall. We ordered the combo for two. The food was amazing. The service was great and the portions were huge. The salad and banchan that was included was delicious."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Korean food and dining experience I've had. The ambiance and food were top notch. Brian our server was attentive and explained everything....A definite go to place! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had been hearing rumblings about a new Korean BBQ opening in Desert Ridge, I was excited but in all honesty I wasn't expecting much just primarily due to its location but I was still stoked to try it out and even more so after reading so many positive reviews on Yelp.
To say I was blown away would be an understatement, Sizzle is one of the best Korean BBQ's I've had, and is possibly the best in Phoenix! First the quality of the meat is top notch, the side dishes were all authentic and delicious and service was great. It can get a little pricey, but I think the experience, quality of food makes up for the price.

Ordered some delicious makkoli to drink, and to my surprise they served it with the large metal bowl. Ordered the Korean dumplings, they were flavorful and cooked perfectly! The Steamed egg and some rice to go with the meat. I was a little bummed that they were out of the Prime Rib Eye the night I went but we ordered the Marinated Price Think Sliced beef, Soy Marinated Pork Shoulder Rib and the Spicy Pork Jowl... Every bite on each meat was out of this world delicious. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to Korean BBQ, but this place was disappointing. We got the Beef Combo and only one of the meats was seasoned well; the others were either bland or not seasoned at all. When I asked why, the server said that some meats are seasoned, some are not. Huh?  Why not?  Also, the little sides were meh; the only other dish that was good was the salad. 

Note:
1.) You don't do your own grilling here (which is one of the things I was looking forward to), so the server comes to your table every couple of minutes to put the meat on the grill, turn it, etc. It's like teppanyaki without the side show, or seasonings.
2.) A tiny bowl of rice is $2. What Asian meal doesn't automatically come with rice?
3.) They use bar napkins; no dinner napkins."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Sizzle! They have a great concept and are executing it really well. A very fun and interactive dinner; something a little different for a date night! They have both Bibimbap and Hot Stone Bibimbap on a \"secret\" menu - DELISH! I'd suggest they put these one the menu and figure out their pricing. Right now it's inconsistent; each time we go it's a surprise! Last suggestion is to have their servers educate more when you first sit down on the experience and what all the dishes are on the table. 

They're for sure still working on hitting their stride but this place is a winner! So glad they opened! Go try them out."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ experience in AZ. Compatible quality with leading Korean restaurants in California. Very reasonable price (you might think it's bit pricey when you look at the menu, but quality is worth it). MUST TRY place in AZ."}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ place. High quality meat and variety of soju. The peach makgeolli is great."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place since I've heard good things about it. 
I was greeted by a hostess once I walked in, and was told to wait for them to set up a table. They set up the table with salad and side dishes depending on the number of people you have. Once we saw down, the server introduced herself and asked what we wanted. We placed our order and everything was going well until the meat came out and it was time start cooking and eating. Our server was very busy, since she was assigned to a couple of tables. It was hard to ask to refill our water. Once she did notice we were out of water, she took the bottle but never replaced it with a new one. Since she had way too many tables to cook the meat for, she cranked up the gas when she cooked our meat. The flames were high and the meat was being cooked with the flames going right through it. The meat tasted horrible! It tasted straight up gas and it was so bitter! I know that the server is in a rush to get the meat cooked... but it made it taste sooooo bad! I had to force it down my throats since the food was so expensive! We tried telling the server that we will cook it ourselves, which she said okay to. But she later would come back and take over and scolded us for taking over. 
I think what would have made the experience better would be if the server asked us how well done we liked our meat. We prefer medium to medium well for beef, but she made everything well done. I took a piece of meat when she hopped onto another table to cook for them for a couple of seconds and it was soooooo delicious because it was cooked medium. The meat melted in my mouth and was so tender and flavorful. I tried moving the meat to the side so it wouldn't become well done and taste like gas... but when the server came back, she gave me a stern look and clamped the meat back to the center. She continued having the flames go through the meat and cook it well done. They tasted horrible after being burned for so long. 
What would have also made the experience better is if the restaurant or server offers to let us cook our meat ourselves. This way, the customers can have the meat the way they want it. If not, then at least please try to ask the customers how they like their meat cooked and not to scorn at customers."}
{"text":"I have come here several times before! 
Cindy is always working when my friends and I come in. She is so friendly and genuine. I sincerely feel welcomed when I come to Sizzle!
Their Korean bbq is very good! The vibe is energetic and they play kpop music which gives it more of an authentic feel. The servers cook the meat for you and it is good quality. They have the option to do combo meals, you get the most bang for your buck this way! They are also open late! 
They also have Korean rice wine! 
I came here for lunch today and had the hot stone bibimbap and it wasn't my favorite. My friends had the kimchi stew and it was very good though! Also, when you sit, the air vent can block your view of the people sitting in front of you which isn't ideal.
However, when I come here I know I'm going to get good quality service! Everything else I have had there is very good though. It may be out of the way since it's not in Chandler/Tempe/Mesa but I highly recommend coming through to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Have never been to Korean BBQ, so after waiting 10 minutes for a table in a basically empty restaurant, we were given a very uninformative run down on how it worked. No one seemed to know what was going on. We finally got seated, small bowls of stuff were on the table that were not explained, and no napkins or forks. Only metal chop sticks and a spoon. Meat was fatty and under-seasoned, and we were required to order a meat per person. Very expensive for the small cuts of meat. Left hungry and spent $250 dollars on basically appetizers. A real rip-off, and definitely no wiser to real Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great atmosphere. However, the service was horrible and the food lacked fundamentals to traditional Korean BBQ. 
1. Korean BBQ aka beef and LEAF typically has lettuce to wrap up the meat and the fixings. In this instance you're told to just eat the cut up meat. It takes away from the authentic experience. 
2. The service was horrible. Maybe we were just one of the unlucky ones. We had the waitress with the Monroe piercing, and she had the worst attitude throughout our lunch. I'm not even someone that expects over the top service, but the combination of her attitude and lack of service is the reason I'll never return. It took her 15 minutes to even come by and take our order. She never bothered to refill our water even when asked. We were halfway done with our meat before our rice finally got to our table. Rule #1 Never go somewhere your business isn't wanted. 
3. It's a shame the service was so bad because the food was pretty good. 

Place has great potential, but there are some things that need to fixed. I'd recommend addressing the bad customer service and add leafs to the beef and leaf experience. Food was really tasty and the place had a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have had Korean BBQ in San Fran and New York, but Sizzle is the best Korean BBQ I have every had.  First, the meat and quality of the food in general was fantastic.  Second, I didn't what to cook a meal but we went to Korean BBQ anyway because the wife wanted to go - I am glad we did as at Sizzle they cook your food at the table (which has a cool retractable smoke hood).  They did a great job preparing the food - much better than I would have done.

The marinated beef was my favorite. Go and enjoy!  

One last tip, it's a great place to bring out of towers that may thing their food culture is better than Arizona's (I am talking to people with family and friends in California)."}
{"text":"Great KBBQ I have ever had in Arizona! 
Coming from LA I always have big expectations with Korean food. This place is clean, the staff is attentative. However, it's quite expensive! My boyfriend and I spent $100 for the Beef combo and two bowls of rice + 20% tip. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A KBBQ THAT DOES NOT COMPLIMENT THE PLATE ORDER OF MEAT WITH RICE?! 
All in all, the meat quality is great. Probably the best you'll find in AZ. We were talking to one of the chefs/owner and he informed us they get their meat from LA. 

Would I go back again? Yes, but only on a certain occasion. $100 for two people is quite outrageous. 

& NEED BETTER SIDE DISHES. Please think about adding lettuce wraps or rice paper into it!!!!"}
{"text":"Our first experience eating Korean barbecue. Fantastic experience at sizzle. We ordered the meat combo for two people. All the meet is marinated and to die for! Oh my God the ribeye so good......
Server was great explained all the side dishes and was attentive to us. Definitely going to be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"Seriously shocked how anyone gives this place more than 1 star. We came here for something new, and based on previous reviews were very excited to give it a go. We got the beef platter for two. To start all the \"sides\" come out way before your meat and they don't explain what they're for, just a small plate with like four bites of potato salad? Random salad?Or a cup of cilantro? Weird. Moving on, our server starts to cook the beef, cutting it with scissors, not appealing but I could have gotten over it. Tried to first cut of meat, all you can taste is propane/ yuck! My wife spit it out, she continues to cook the other cuts of meat and again the same thing. My wife didn't eat anything as she was concerned about the strong flavor of propane when she's breastfeeding our child. I tried to stifle it down but eww, so terrible. To top it off we asked for plates, they were the size of a small cup and we got 2 cocktail napkins instead of any real napkins. Which you need since most of the food was spit into them! Would never recommend."}
{"text":"Seriously the best meal I've had in a while.  Amazing service.  Amazing food.  And it's an experience, not just a meal.  My 5 year old loved it too."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed Sizzle.  I love Korean pickles and condiments, and all were placed at our table before we were seated.  A nice touch.  I ordered the marinated beef short ribs and the marinated pork ribs.  Really good quality meats.  Also tried the kimchi rice and dumplings. Both were tasty.  Our server/chef was awesome!  I have limited experience with Korean BBQ restaurants but, I know quality when I taste it and see it. I highly recommend Sizzle.  It must be good to impress all the Korean ex-pats I saw in the dining room while we were there."}
{"text":"It is a tad on the expensive side, $55 for two, but our meal and service were excellent. I liked the steel serving bowls. We ordered Wagyu Beef Belly, really good, and Soy Marinated Pork Short Rib, good but will try something else next time. We really enjoyed the Korean omelet that came with our order. The best was we came on a Sunday afternoon around noon, and sat down immediately. No wait, no crowd. This place is best for couples, a family or larger party my find the tables cramped."}
{"text":"Oh man! I have been wanting to try this place ever since the first time it opened. We are regulars at Desert Ridge and eat out quite often. We finally had a reason to try this spot, had our cousins with us for his birthday. We both have children, 3 year olds and babies. When we walked in the hostess looked at us..party of eight..4 of which are small children. She asked us if we were sure we wanted to eat here because of the children, we thought she meant it as a safety issue and started to think about it. The hostess then proceeded to open the menu and tell us that it was an expensive restaurant, \"see $60 for an entre...\" ummmmm....really, are you telling us your restaurant is too expensive because we have children? You really should not be a hostess. Oh well, I guess I will always wonder if your food is good or not because you will not be earning our business. We ate at the Yard House, it was great. Great for families great for kids. A perfect place to spend your money when Sizzle doesn't want it!"}
{"text":"Horrific service.  
Server did not bother to explain one thing.
Dropped off food, did not come back went into restroom for over half hour.
Was not able to order anything else or another beverage.
Finally had to ask manager for check so we could leave.
Explained our experience to manager, which was met with ....\"we are sorry next time it will be better\"
Alas, there will be no next time, don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"In the beginning, the waft of the delicious smell of a Korean BBQ fills your nostrils as you walk in. The visit proceeded and nothing too eventful happened. I was skeptical when several different cuts and types of meat were placed on the same grill. The visit ended and I proceeded home and broke out in a sweat all of the sudden. I couldn't figure out why my stomach had just lit itself on fire and jumped off a bridge. Before I knew it, I was running for the target. (If you know what I mean.) After lots of painful vomiting and three days time, my stomach had finally decided to calm. I would not recommend eating here, as now I am sad to say how  disappointed I am in such an expensive meal:("}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!  Food was top quality and the service is impeccable!  My family are KBBQ lovers and snobs.  We usually get our KBBQ fix in Ktown, Los Angeles.  We are so happy that the same, if not better, KBBQ is now available in Phoenix!  

There are many choices of meat on the menu but the combo is probably the best of all.  The four of us ordered the large combo then added 3 extra meats.  Kimchi rice, stew pot and Seafood Pancakes are all very very good.  All meats are cooked on the hot plate on our table.  There is a movable ventilation fan above the hot plate that sucks up the smoke which is very user-friendly.  Our server was very attentive and did a great cooking job for us.  

Staffs are ver friendly and attentive.  Meat quality is superior and the price is reasonable. 
We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place had great service and the atmosphere is nice.  The BBQ station is different and the meat takes on the taste of the fuel, which is why I give this place a 3 stars. The waitress was nice and grills all of our meat.  I'm used to grilling my own, but their grill can burn you since it's almost on an open flame (probably why you have a fuel taste left in the meat).  

We got the large beef combo for $99.  I think it's a little pricey for Arizona. The beef brisket was hard when usually this is one of the best part or Korean BBQ (usually juicier).  The other meat was more chewy. The marinated short ribs was the best tasting, but again I've had better in LA. Their side dishes were great and they serve you steamed eggs and we got the soybean stew which was great."}
{"text":"Confusing!!! Our waitress didn't speak any English! When you get to your table there is a ton of little plates with different stuff on them and you have no idea what they are and the table already feels overly crowded. The menu ONLY had beef and pork as meats and NO vegetables. We ordered the beef combo and the short rib was the only good meat out of all 5 meets they give you. The meats have 0 season in on them so you have to put salt on it yourself and dip it in sauce to give it flavor. I didn't think any of the sauces tasted good. The combo came with soup, I asked the waitress about the soup and she pointed to one saying spicy and the soybean soup not spicy. So I got the soybean soup which was actually pretty spicy but did have a good taste to it. It came out boiling in a skillet which was cool. The fried rice was very spicy and tasted interesting. I really liked the concept I just think they need to make improvements on the menu and maybe find a way to have less on the table.."}
{"text":"As an American of Irish descent who has lived in South Korea and loves Korean food I can honestly say this is one of the best Korean BBQ restaurants I have been to in the USA, second only to Woo Lae Oak in VA/WashDC area.  Friendly and fast wait staff but it was Friday lunch which was a slow period for them so the wait staff was not fully stress tested.  Kalbi beef rib and Bulgogi beef were exquisite with appropriate kimchi and rice sides... and refreshing Hite lager.  Great food experience!"}
{"text":"yooooooo these haters gotta quit beefin with this Beef-apalooza bc this place is the best korean bbq in the Valley. get off your high horses and get down with some of this Queen La-Beef-ah like your LL Cool J in the Last Holiday or Eugene Levy in Bringing Down the House. 

Make sure you go with a friend (this is probably unnecessary to mention except for people like me who have no friends) and split the beef combo then sit back and enjoy the ride with your partner in crime like you Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah in Taxi.

Plenty of food to set the mood. Personal favorites were the Galbi and the Marinated Prime Bulgogi. Wow-wee-oh-wow-wowza. so beautiful. These Queen La-Beef-ah's do way more beauty work than anything done in the movie Beauty Shop featuring Queen Latifah. (got no more Queen Latifah references. Sorry)

The homies even cook it for you, which I love and made the whole experience easy, breezy, beautiful, CoverGirl (just kidding, had one more Queen Latifah reference up my sleeve ;))"}

{"text":"Great place! Food is outstanding! Service is killer! And the patio fire pit is a wonderful addition to end your meal! Good place for groups. Beautiful remodel."}
{"text":"I'm Korean so my standards were set high for Sizzle. First the quality of the meats were very good and tasty, but the $99 large combo size was ridiculously small. I literally thought they messed up the order and brought the small combo instead. On top of that they charge for rice, which drives me crazy. They don't even serve standard kimchi and have some type of water kimchi, which I thought was disgusting."}
{"text":"Our fist time here! The marinated pork shoulder with all the little sides was just to die for! The sauces are simple but wonderful flavor. Trevor is a great server as he was able to explain how the meal would be prepared and how to enjoy it the most. His beverage recommendation was, just, delicious. Nori thank you for bringing us Korea in Sizzle."}

Korean BBQ in the PHX valley is rare to none.  There's only I few that I attend and Sizzle is on the North side of town which I venture around a lot.  

Sizzle is a small spot and probably not good for large groups unless they're not busy.  Needless to say, this place was popping when I attended with my bud.  It was only two of us, but we still had to wait!  However, as we sat I understood; they prep the table with the side dishes, pickled soy beans, kimchi, potatoes, the fixings!  Oddly, it also came with a side salad and soup.  Wasn't really sure how to share the soup with my buddy!  

We ordered the beef combo since the selection process seemed overwhelming at times.  Even then we had to pick our cuts so we chose the brisket, seasoned short ribs,  ribeye, and the thinly sliced beef.  

To my surprise, the waiter actually grills the meat here, which I was totally not used to since I would have done it myself.  However, I didn't mind it much since I rather appreciate just kicking back and enjoying the food.  Our waiter did an excellent job by the way.  Our meat was cooked from rare to medium rare and just the right about of char at the edges.  The meat was tender and seasoned just right since I didn't even care to use any of the sauces at our table.  

In the end, Sizzle is new hot spot for me.  It can definitely get pricey since it was about $40 a person and we didn't even order beverages.  Service seemed pretty quick to me, but I can gather the wait for a table can be long.  We came during the week, but I'm sure the weekends can be quite busy! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Korean BBQ. It won't be like California where it's all you can eat, but the quality of the meat is far superior than anything else you can find in Arizona. It's a little bit of a drive for me, and I'm not gonna lie, it's kinda pricey, but the experience you get is totally worth it in my opinion!

So there is one thing that was kinda odd. For this restaurant, they cook all the meat for you which is GREAT and WEIRD in two ways! It's GREAT if you're eating with only two people, feels awesome to not have to worry about watching to not overcook your meat. However if you're in a big group, it's kinda odd having someone stand there while you're in mid conversation with all your pals.  

Some other stuff is that a little \"negative\" was that like I said before, everything is pricey. Paying for another bowl of rice is like $2.00 or $2.50 I don't remember. They also don't have barley water or tea, which is kinda sad cause I love having that when eating Korean BBQ. 

All in all, it's a great Korean BBQ place!"}
{"text":"Sizzle is a unique Korean BBQ experience for the area, with an amazing atmosphere and great cuts of meat. Perfect for small groups or date night."}
{"text":"Staff was really nice

Side dishes were good

But the grill omg

So strong made all the meat taste like gas :/"}
{"text":"This was the best introduction to Korean food ever. The food was amazing and the service very good. We had the beef BBQ and I ordered the bibimbap and was so impressed with the flavor and quality of the food. 

I have a feeling other places will pale in comparison so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is very new, just opened up in nov 2016 so everything is sparkling clean. Food were okay, defiantly WILL NOT come back though, why were the manager saying hi to all the tables with Korean speaking customers? Do they pay more than us ? The non speaking Korean? They Need more help, food orders came out too slow, I had to ask the waitress 3 times for my rice and extra egg, u automatically should know we were going to need more than 1 bowl of rice considering there were 4 of us. They r gonna need to improve on their waitress skills, DO NOT give customers attitude even when ur busy, telling me \"I only take order, idk what's going in the kitchen\" is a BIG NO"}
{"text":"The galbi and short ribs were DELICIOUS! I usually like to marinate kbbq at home because I think it tastes better, but this was very winning for me. The meats are cooked for you at the table. You can tell your server you want to cook them yourself if you want privacy, just depending on what your preference is. The meats were delicious in terms of taste. It is a little pricey, but worth it because you will leave feeling full.

Note: Aside from the meats, I got the steamed egg and mango madness. (2 drinks in one)."}
{"text":"Very cool Korean BBQ place and high-quality ingredients for a north Phoenix hotspot. It's a perfect place for a date night in the center of desert ridge near the theater area and more of a romantic evening out than a family atmosphere. Expect to pay a little more than you might think but the ingredients are worth it. A different kind of dining, don't worry they do the cooking for you. Lots of different side items at the table as soon as you arrive. Ask them to explain the process if you're a first timer. Beer runs about $8 for a 20 ounce and are perfect to share. We ordered two kinds of meats the only downfall is that rice is an extra charge so be sure to ask. We ordered Prime Ribeye, Sliced Wagyu Beef Belly, two 20 oz beers and rice (extra charge) and the tab came to $91 before tip. Our waitress Cindy was ok, however it was difficult to ask questions about the meals. The Korean BBQ restaurant experience is new to most Americans and we did feel a little rushed to order the meal. Overall, great experience, try it at least once, but don't let them rush you out the door because you deserve to enjoy the meal you're paying for."}
{"text":"Our night out at Sizzle started out a little rough as our waiter brought out the wrong flavored soju. He was a nice guy with limited english but after bringing out a bottle of strawberry basil lemonade soju twice after requesting peach we decided it was better not to order it. He then brought over the manager who lectured us going to the length of getting an empty soju bottle from the kitchen to explain that they threw away 2 carafes and we were mistaken and wasteful. Pretty awkward.

Service throughout the night was pretty slow as they seemed understaffed and we couldn't cook our own meat which was frustrating. (Requesting banchan was pretty painful too) For around $35+ a person you expect more from a higher priced KBBQ experience.

The meat here though made the visit worth it. Amazing short ribs and the bulgogi here is actual slices of steak rather them the marinated mystery meat at other places. Skip the Yuk Hwe (raw beef) which had more quantity than quality of frozen flat tasting beef. 

Overall, the best KBBQ I've had in Phoenix but really poor service matched with small portions. People here will probably have to put up with it but in LA there's friendlier and better alternatives.

The quality of the food here is around the levels of Quarters in LA. The price itself is a bit shocking. Parks BBQ charges around the same and for a place in Phoenix to charge the same one of the best places in KTown...Yikes"}
{"text":"Best Korean food in AZ in my opinion.  The meat is very good along with the Chigae.  My daughter loves this place.  The dining area is well done and the staff very friendly"}
{"text":"I give this place one star because I didn't even get to seated after waiting 30-35 minutes to be seated after others, who came after me, were seated. The hostess gave me a pager and said to stay in the vicinity so that when the table was ready we could be seated. I did and thought it was taking a little longer than she said it would. I waited a few minutes and then asked her if she called me. She said she did. She tested the pager. It worked. (It didn't page while I was outside!) She said sorry but it'll be another 10-15 minutes. We waited and yet again someone else got seated before. I understand it was a busy night, but give me a break! Lousy service. I said forget it. I miss the Korean BBQ places in Southern CA."}
{"text":"Bomb dot com!!  Omg finally an LA style Korean BBQ!!!  Love that they have top quality meats!  Service is great atmosphere is fun and food is worth every penny!!  Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Waited forever to get seated. Server didn't know anything. Steak was all fat, and I don't mean good fat, I mean uneatable gristle. Outrageously expensive for what you get. Never going back."}
{"text":"This place was right on point I highly recommend to try it out. You have to get the dumplings as an appetizer their 6 and they're quite large my kids said they're the best they've ever had. One entree is enough to share for two or possible 3. We have decided that  When we come back we will try a new entree each time everything looked amazing even the desert would be enough to share."}
{"text":"Wow, I love this place!!! I was very interested after reading all the reviews. My husband and I Love Korean BBQ so this was a must try. The bad reviews seem to revolve around the price, so I am not going to lie, it is pricey.  My husband and I got the beef combo for 2 and a couple of drinks and paid $112 which included tip. But when you go to a restaurant like this you go for the experience. Our waitress was amazing, she cooked for us and gave us tips on what items to put together as well as helped us choose certain items off the menu. She most definitely did not steer us wrong. The Kimchi stew was absolutely incredible, my new obsession. Everything we had was so very good. We will definitely return and bring all our friends who don't mind spending a little money for a great meal and experience!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in tonight for the first time and we LOVED it! Everything from the food to the atmosphere felt very authentic. We ordered the short rib soup and the tofu soup as our main entrees along with some other items from their side menu and everything was cooked so perfectly. The most memorable thing for me was the cilantro kimchi!!! I never had anything like it before it was soo tasty. We will be back real soon to try out their BBQ, look forward to my next review! :)"}
{"text":"In all honesty, I just wanted to go home after the meal. My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place, the hostess was nice, greeted us, asked us if it was our first time and it was. Thought we would get an explanation about how it works and such, no but that wasn't a big deal. We got seated after the sides were prepared and such (wouldn't it have been a bit faster to seat people and bring the sides?) . Our server came by greeted us, we asked how their system workers with the response of \"you get 2\" . . . 2 of what ? Not much explanation was given, so we winged it. Gave us time to order and got our drinks, even got a steamed egg, it took a while for our meat to come by, it was starting to get busy as more people came by. Our server had brought our first order. She started cooking our meat, Im gonna be honest its awkward to have someone in between to cooking while we are trying to enjoy our night out. The portions of food were incredibly small (for the $71 we paid for). The waitress would stop cooking our food to go talk to another table because they were unsatisfied with their visit. Very nice looking place , good atmosphere, thats the only reason its getting 2 stars."}
{"text":"I tried this place with my friend going the experience would be authentic Korean BBQ we were used to. This place definitely hit the mark with some small caveats. 

The meat and ingredients used are amazing and what drove me to give it such a high review. All the meat was high quality and well marinated. My only issues were that you don't cook your own food and portions are a little smaller than the norm for Korean BBQ. Considering there isn't another Korean BBQ place in Arizona of the same quality I can easily let those slide."}
{"text":"Stopped by with parents for dinner...pretending we are in LA koreantown...this place's galbi is up there (relatively speaking) with K-town...pretty freaking good!! Shockingly good actually!! This is by far the best Korean BBQ in the valley...I mean by far!!!! They cook for you and do an amazing job!! The galbi is the best by far...the rest of the meat is lacking of flavor but you need to dip into the salt dish and then the sauce with the jalapeño and the flavor completely changes...it's pretty good with the mixture!! Literally only place we go to now for Korean BBQ..."}
{"text":"Our dining experience was great and everything was delicious. However, I think the food and drinks were overpriced. $100 for 3 people with a drink each. Yikes!"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch the other day and I must say, it is pretty freaking good. That being said, it is a bit overpriced and I believe you don't get free refills on soda as they provided me with a can and a glass rather than fountain pour. 

The service was nice and you can tell the put pride into the food they provide. Just be prepared to drop  at least $80 for two people. 

Also, this is not all you can eat like most Korean BBQ, but the food is night and day in quality...

Overall, try it once... I would prob eat here once or twice a year max, based off price."}
{"text":"I've never had Korean BBQ before- so fair warning on that. 

I liked all of the meat options which were cooked at our table, and to order. Some were better than others: more flavorful or more tender, like short rib, beef belly, and ribeye. Overall it was a TON of beef, maybe even more than I could handle. There was a bunch of sauces and side items on the table, but I actually didn't like any of them which meant I basically only ate meat for lunch. The fermented items and steamed egg were strange to me. 

For me, if I want an all meat meal, I'll pick Fogo de Chao. But if someone else wanted to go here, I would come back, I just wouldn't choose it only own."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best Korean BBQ I've ever had.  Definitely try a mix of the marinated and non-marinated options.  You really can't go wrong if you order one meat selection per individual in your group.  If you are only two people, I suggest three selections for variety.  The best dish by far is the Marinated Short Rib \"Gal-bi\" followed a close second by the Wagyu Beef Belly.  I would say the spicy Pork shoulder would be a close third.  Order all three for a great variety.  The Berkshire Black Pork Belly lacks flavor, I would choose something marinated.  Although you can cook for yourself, let them do it, they know what they are doing.  The fried rice is unreal.  This place rocks."}
{"text":"Fabulous food! Lindsay was our server & she was lovely & knowledgeable. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. I suggest the pork collection. I made the mistake of bringing my small children (5 and 1) however the staff was very accomodating. Everything is cooked in front of you and leads to a fun experience. Great date night location!"}
{"text":"Called Garage Door Services for an appointment, was told between 10 and 1 today. It is now 2:25 and still no show. They cannot tell me when someone will be there. They should not be taking appointments that they cannot make. My entire day was wasted waiting on them."}
{"text":"Stopped in at this place for a good bite before a movie nearby and it was worth the visit. As others have said, it's a bit pricy but the food is really good. The wife had beef bulgogi and I ordered the spicy pork shoulder. No complaints whatsoever, but if you're hungry be prepared to share. They cook the meal right at the table, one meat type at a time. That was ok with us, but may seem odd to some people. 

The steamed egg and other sides were good. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been to sizzle a few times now and feel the restaurant food quality and taste is really good but too expensive.  The Korean bbq is good and fresh but I feel their other traditional Korean dishes are better priced and overall make for a better family meal for the price."}
{"text":"$$$ pricey dinner, however it was worth it. The 2 person combo probably could have fed 3, maybe 4. Our waiter was actually from Korea so it was a bonus to hear how they eat the BBQ in Seoul, what sauces to use, etc."}
{"text":"Came very close to authentic Korean bbq will definitely come back!!! Especially for the kimchi fried rice!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Reminds me of South Korea. Great food and atmosphere! Love the service."}
{"text":"I took my family to try this place for the first time on Saturday.  It has great salad, side dishes, and some awesome marinated pork and beef main dishes."}
{"text":"I found the whole concept confusing, disappointing, way overpriced for what you get. The only pro was the location itself.

I waited about 20 minutes and was greeted by the host. We sat in the grilling section. The table was already set up with Banchans (side dishes), and salad. It came with a free steamed egg. We thought it was interesting since most Korean restaurants bring the Banchans after you've placed the order.

We started eating then waiter came by to put in our order. Apparently, the grill seating section required 2 meat orders or combo with no exception. I didn't want to eat meat or grill. I really wanted the other menu items. There was the non-grilled seating section option. The waiter indicated that the host should have addressed at time of seating if we wanted grill or non-grilling. I don't recall the host mentioning anything at all. Absolutely confusing! 

Finally, the waiter allowed us just order one meat selection. I am not used going to a Korean place that the waiter grills the meat for you. Normally, the waiter just cut the meat and not grills the meat. I rather do the grilling myself. That is the true Korean BBQ experience. I found the constant interruption with the waiter grilling the meat was so annoying. I can never finish the conversation.  

I guess if you want a personal chef this place might be for you. It was definitely not for me."}
{"text":"We ordered the beef package and everything was very good. The meats are of high quality and well marinated. The restaurant has a really cool exhaust fan over each table that can be lowered to right above the grill to get rid of the smell. We chose to cook the meats table top and the waitress did all the grilling for us and everything came out perfect.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that maybe due to language barrier the waitress didn't explain to us that much about what is what and how things work. I'm not Korean so all this was kinda exotic to me, some education would be nice :)"}
{"text":"My first experience with Korean BBQ and I was blown away by the amazing meal and service we received! We had the beef and pork combo as well as the kimchi stew and the beef stew. The kimchi rice was off the charts!! This was seriously one of the best meals I have ever had..! Most definitely recommended and already looking forward to going back!! Wish I could give 6+ stars!!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! FANTASTIC!!!
I've never been to any Korean BBQ this good before in AZ.

The meat quality is exceptional. They are very tender and juicy. The key  word is \"medium rare\".   Just let your servers know, \"medium rare\" I'm sure you will be amazed. I've never have any beef that melts in my mouth  like that before. Its crazy delicious. Oh!!! Galbi marinade is bomb. It's just right!

And hey, if you know nothing about Korean BBQ , don't worry. All the servers here are trained to help. They cook for you. Key  word \"medium rare\" babyyyy . Every single table is set up with a \"kitchen exhaust fan\", no smoke  got in my face or clothes. I love it .

Price!!! I think a lot of people might think it's pricey. However, if you give it a try, you'll think it's worth it. This place is just amazing, high-end but authentic!!!
RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"I went here on a cold December weeknight expecting to be comforted by lots of great KBBQ.  I was disappointed by the 1) service 2) the small portion sizes and 3) the taste of their soup.

We ordered the 2 person beef combo for over $64.  I didn't like that we couldn't cook our own food and the service wasn't very attentive at times.  It took over 15 minutes to get the check and wrap up.  The portions were small compared to other KBBQ places I've been to in LA.  I left hungry.  The kimchi stew was not very flavorful and the ingredients were very hard.  I would not recommend this for anyone looking for a fantastic experience.  If you're craving meat and are willing to pay a premium for it, sadly this is the closest you'll find without driving out to LA."}

Moving out here from California, I never thought I would find a KBBQ place as good as places that I have been. Somehow this place has become my favorite place to get KBBQ. We got the small beef combo and small pork combo and every single cut of meat was perfection. All the ban chan was perfect. The soju was perfect. Cindy is perfect. Everything about this place is perfection. If I got to choose how I die, it would be from internal bleeding from eating 94 lbs of meat from this perfect place. Everyone was super friendly and prompt. I will be back very soon because gluttony although a sin, feels so good just like every sin."}
{"text":"Great food awesome atmosphere, Lindsay help us cook food very cool concept!! Definitely a must try !!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great! We had someone actually cook all of our meats in front of us. We ordered the chadol, pork belly and kimchi tofu soup! All was delicious!"}
{"text":"Says they are open to midnight, but locked up and dark before 11:30.  I even called and they said they would be taking seating until 11:30."}
{"text":"Pro: The owners had a specific clientele in mind and have adapted their theme to fit that. Well-to-do Middle Class who have yet to experience Korean BBQ and would like to experience some diversity in their meals, but have no idea how to do it and are scared of it. They've elevated the experience and stand out with constant table side service and overall, a refined and higher quality.

Con: The entire thing I just wrote above. 

My biggest gripe is the way they've laid out their service.The place is smaller than you'd expect with just 15 tables. If your entire party isn't here at once, they won't seat you - even though place is half empty. We had a party of 6 and was waiting just for one person.There is no room for you to stand in the front, so whether it's freezing in the winter or scalding in the summer, you have to wait outside. On top of that, then they will make you wait even longer so they can set up the banchan and fancy table settings. My people are hangry, there's 8 empty tables in front of our very eyes and yet we're reduced to standing outside waiting for something we can't logically understand. Is this what it's like to be Charlie looking longingly at the Chocolate Factory?

Prices are extreme and portions are a tad smaller than average. Average of $30 per meat plate and the price of their soju will make you do a double take because you thought they charged you for sake instead. They've simplified the menu and don't have a lot of the normal things you'd see on a Korean menu like japchae, etc. Servers don't write down anything so they're bound to forget a couple of things you ordered, especially if you go down the combo route like we did. We ordered the large beef and the large pork and Kimchi Fried Rice. It was juuuust enough for 3 people and our bill came out to $160. Yikes, I'm still internally crying about that. 

Here's the catch: When the raw meat finally comes to your grill/table, you're not allowed to touch it. They cook it for you, which is fine if you're a novice and have no idea what you're doing but for our party, we asked if we could take over and do it ourselves. The moment we put our hands on the tongs though, our server internally freaked out and looked like we had done something wrong. Her eyes went straight to her manager like she was going to get in trouble, so we awkwardly backed off. So now, you have a server constantly by your side with her hand stretched across the table while you try to make some conversation with your friends. It definitely felt forced and intrusive. Also, because they're stuck to your table, if you want to order something extra, you have to wait a while because they're afraid the meat will burn while they're away nor can they attend to the other tables they've been assigned to so other guests have to just gawk and wait. Makes me wonder how this works when they're actually at capacity. 

Don't get me wrong, the server was lovely and the service was great. The Wagyu Beef Belly, Boneless Kalbi, and Pork Jowl were delicious and a change from the norm. But it was just really, really weird. Everything you would normally do at a Korean BBQ place isn't welcomed at this restaurant. The pricing here really isn't justified, even if rent at Desert Ridge is expensive and you have constant table side service (which would go towards the tip). There's not many Korean places on the West Side, but I don't suggest this being an option - make the drive to the East Side and you'll still save a butt load. I drove 40 minutes to try this place and probably won't be coming back unless I suddenly have a sugar daddy/momma (I'm not picky).

Summary - If you love Korean BBQ, you'll be offended by this place. If you have a clueless white father-in-law like I do, he would absolutely adore this place."}
{"text":"So I came here yesterday for lunch. The interior is super clean and chic and most importantly was the fans that moved up and down to suck up all the smoke. When it comes to Korean BBQ, I always hate smelling like it when I leave. But with this set up, I was happy I didn't reek of BBQ smoke. 

As a die-hard Korean BBQ lover and from Korea, it's hard to find a really good Korean place in AZ. Well, here it is! We got two orders of the Chadol (the thinly sliced brisket) and one order of the Galbi (marinated short rib). It automatically comes w egg steam. Yum!! The galbi was huge portions and the quality of the meat was amazing!! And chadol was very good too and not too fatty. The server cooked all the meats for us!! (Be sure to tip them extra!!) 

We got some other entrees as well. My mom got the bibimbap and it didn't disappoint. All the traditional and comfort food flavors were in it! We also got the spicy tofu soup (soon du bu) w beef. Seriously very good! Best soon du bu in AZ I have tasted. And I ordered the seafood pancake (haemool pa jeon) but the breading was a little too thick and the owner came and apologized it wasn't up to par. Wow! Super impressed w the food, management and service!! I highly recommend this spot!! 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Three of us shared the beef combo, and I would say that unless you're super hungry, the small is actually plenty for 3 people. We decided to throw in a pork belly because I've fallen deeply and madly in love with pork belly lately, and we had to struggle to finish that. The servers are really friendly and will chitchat with you as they're cooking your KBBQ (could be a good thing or bad thing if you're really just wanting to shove food in your mouth and not make small talk)

This might be the only KBBQ restaurant in Phoenix that's styled this way, so if you're confused, please ask! They asked us to make sure that we had done KBBQ before, but I think all three of us had KBBQ in all the ways under the sun. They seemed more than willing to explain it to us. I'll include a quick primer for people who haven't had an experience like this place. I'm not Korean, so if it's not proper just let me know. This is how I've approached KBBQ.

I suggest doing one of the combos so you have the chance to try out different cuts of meat. I feel like variety is key. The small dishes that are laid out are side dishes called banchan. These will vary by season and by restaurant--I feel like every time I go to a different KBBQ place, I encounter a banchan that I haven't seen before. There are also seasonings for the meat (coarse salt, jalapeno pickle sauce, and Korean chili paste), as well as aromatics (green onion and regular onion, I think). Really, you make the rules here. Eat banchan before, during, in-between, or after the meats are cooking. Eat the meat with or without the seasonings or aromatics. This is the fun part of KBBQ, you get to play and do whatever. If you like a banchan a lot and it runs out, ask for a refill (they're free).

They do cook your meat here so if you're wanting to do that, this is not the place to do it. But honestly I'm lazy and like this style of KBBQ more than when someone in the party has to do the work. I can just sit back and eat the meat as it rolls in. Portions are a tad smaller for what you would get elsewhere, but the meat was high quality and I was contently full at the end.

The marinated short rib and the beef belly were my favorites, but all of the meats were delicious. Some meats are fatty and marbled...sorry if you hate fat but that's what makes the meat delicious and melty."}
{"text":"They have wonderful meat served from a personal grill at the center of your table. The meat comes with about a half dozen side dishes, pickled vegetables, kimchi, little salads, etc in little shallow bowls. It's great for a family or a group of friends. The communal aspect of it is a big part of why the place works. 

The environment is clean and chic, befitting Desert Ridge-- not a hole-in-the-wall strip mall place. The prices reflect that. This restaurant is suitable for a special occasion. 

One suggestion for the management. While everyone understands grilled meat, a lot of your customers will not be familiar with the sides. It would be helpful if your menu had a guide and also explained when/ how they are traditionally eaten. Do you eat the garnishes before the meat, after, on top of, between bites? Going into an experience like this, I like to learn something about the culture I'm partaking of."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it moved into Desert Ridge and it did not disappoint. I'm so glad I went. The sides were beautiful and delicious although I wish they had sardines. The egg pot, beets, and fish cakes were on point. We ordered the small pork dinner - pork belly, pork short rib, and spicy pork shoulder butt. We also had beef bulgogi. It was all cooked to perfection and so delicious. I'm going back soon with all my friends because I told them all how delicious it was. I only got a picture of the sides because after that I was focused on the eating. It's a little on the pricier side but it was worth every penny.  Everyone was really nice. I only wish it was a little bit bigger. It's a small space so not much room. And there was a line out the door the whole night. Maybe they can open a second one in my backyard. That would solve all the problems."}
{"text":"We normally go to the AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants, because of all the great reviews, we thought we would give it a go!

I'm glad we did. There were 4 in our group, so we ordered the large \"Beef Combo\". Beef belly, Rib eye, Short ribs, Thin sliced beef and Kimchi stew. The meat quality was top notch, the air wasn't smoky like most \"cook yourself\" places and the sides were plentiful. Wonderful, friendly service at a fair price. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent!   I have had a number of things here now including the denjang chigae, the kimchee chigae, the kimchee fried rice, the bibimbap and the bbq.  Everything has been delicious.   The service is not great when they're busy, but I think it's cool that they cook all of the meat for you.  I definitely do not like the placement of the vents because it's hard to have a conversation with someone across the table from you.  It's reasonably priced and the best part is that they're open until 2 a.m.!  I will definitely be going back and I will thoroughly enjoy the Korean BBQ Feast for two. It actually feeds four of us.  The steamed egg was equally delicious. It really feels like I'm either in Seoul or inside of a Korean drama.  Did I mention the panchan and the ajumani who is cooking?   It's delicious and very authentic."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this new restaurant. Waitress explained the menu to us before we ordered. We opted for the small beef combo and added pork belly since there were 3 of us. The meat quality was exceptional and there were so many things (side dishes, steamed egg in clay pot, kimchee or soybean stew) that came with the meal. The price is higher than other Korean BBQ I've been to but the portion makes up for the price. The waitress did all the cooking for us too. All we had to do was just eat when she told us it was ready. I'd highly recommend; It's no wonder they get high rating on yelp."}
{"text":"Run...don't walk...away from this place. This is the laziest and most inattentive wait staff I have encountered in awhile. The restaurant is the size of a walk-in closet, yet somehow our waitress managed to ignore us the entire evening choosing instead to gossip with the cook with her back turned to the restaurant for nearly an hour. Don't expect any pleasantries or human interaction either.   If it weren't for the busboy or the friendly host at the front desk, we would still be waiting for our check. Now let's talk about the food. This is NOT authentic Korean food -  this is phony tourist food and it's not even good. It is ridiculously overpriced. The meat is so full of fat make sure you pack your dental floss and toothpick.  And you may want to carry your heart medicine too. You could easily dine at the finest steakhouses in Scottsdale and Phoenix and pay WAY less than this. And, if the health department is watching, consider this my report that our waitress left the chopping block and utensils that had raw steak on it sitting on our table the entire night instead of taking it away the way she was supposed to. Lazy, lazy, lazy and did I mention inattentive and the food is mediocre, non-authentic and overpriced? Don't be sucker...go find some real Korean food or just walk to Nori and have a good Japanese meal with friendly and attentive staff.

It's a shame, this place is in a great location and could and should be way more than it chooses to be."}
{"text":"This was our very first visit here, we came for lunch but could have easily just stayed for the rest of the night! Such amazingly tasty food and even better service. Definitely would reccomend to others."}
{"text":"This place is pretty spendy, my partner and I did the BBQ and we got two different meats and our total ended up being $70. 

But the place seems very clean, the meat was great and love the side dishes that came with the BBQ. My waitress was really sweet and kind. She also gave us suggestion to visit in the area since we were tourists. 

This place is located at a mall, So park wherever you like there's many to choose from."}
{"text":"4 star on the food, was just ok, nothing really stood out as great or fantastic other than the marinated meats and the soy bean stew. 5 star for the hostess who greeted us, she was fantastic even when my wife asked last minute for a booth instead of a table. Now this was our first time experiencing a restaurant like this. I let our waitress know and asked for her to explain how this would go. She rolled her eyes and became very condescending. The place was very noisy and her accent made it very difficult to hear her, so each time I leaned in and asked her to repeat herself, she appeared to be annoyed with me. At one point I even asked her if I was frustrating her. So a 2 star for that. Over all we might return just because we know what to expect. But if this is your first time experiencing this type of restaurant I would say read up or maybe try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellet korean bbq inside the desert ridge mall - it is a bit pricy but it is the best I had around here.  I liked the prime rib pieces but would really recommend the outer skirt steak pieces and wagyu.  The side dishes were good and their bibimbap was decent; however their stength is in their bbq.  I also recommend you let the helper grill the meat for you; they are much better at it even if you think you can do better.  They use different grill for different meat and are familiar with the strength of the flame on different spot.  We let our waitress handle the grilling. She asked how we like our meat done and we said medium and that is exactly how everything was grilled.  The only thing I have to ding this place for that they charge extra for rice and lettuce.  These are normally free in korean bbq house.  Oh also, I really liked their soy bean soup - it was really well done - good portion with strong soy bean taste.  If you are there in a group of 3-4, I recommend getting their $99 beef combo."}
{"text":"For a Korean BBQ restaurant in Arizona, this place is pretty good. They do not take reservations and the tables probably seat a max of 5-6 people, so this is not a place to take your 12 friends for a birthday party. We went on a Saturday and got there just before 7pm and it was a full house. The hostess quoted us about a 30 minute wait so we took a pager and waited outside. The wait was about 30-40 minutes and when we got inside, our table was already setup with side dishes and water. We got the beef combo and a side order of pork belly and the cold radish noodles. Trevor was our server and he cooked all of our meats for us and did a great job. He was super attentive and made sure the meat didn't burn, all while taking care of several other tables at the same time. Usually with KBBQ, you cook the meats yourself, but it was nice to not have to attend to the meat. They also change out the grill top when changing from cooking one type of meat to another to not contaminate the different meats. The meats were all really tender and flavorful. They were playing old 90s - 2000s Kpop music, which I absolutely loved and was jamming out the whole time while eating. I will say it's pretty pricey here, especially if you plan to drink, but it was totally worth it! This is definitely not somewhere we'd come weekly but for special occasions or when we're wanting some good KBBQ."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for dinner and was appalled at the service and the food. Our meat was fatty and gristle. All under cooked-even when asked to make them more well done. Waitress had an attitude the entire time. And our bill was 130. We left still hungry... and watch out they add gratuity in the bull."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Very pricey for what it is. It's a little confusing at first with little to no explanation. Just go with it!"}
{"text":"There's been a huge boom in Korean BBQ here in the Valley and this one stands out due to that it is not AYCE (all you can eat).  
The reason is pretty evident from the pictures of their meats online.
This is a full service premium KBBQ restaurant.  The cuts of meat are much much higher quality than at the others (LOOK at the marbling!) and the servers will cook all the meat for you.  
I've been to all the new places multiple times and even though this place is pricey, I end up coming here due to the quality and the fact they're open really late on the weekends.
Sizzle is better for smaller intimate groups and it's definitely not a place to bring people who are going to be ordering their own thing and paying separately.  
I've had close friends go who are more independant(?) and HAD to order their own thing and they ended up having to wait until their meat got cooked because their choice just happened to be cooked after other choices."}
{"text":"I was wishing to try an example of Korean BBQ cuz I watch a lot of K-drama and omg this place was great! They have a person BBG your meat for you so you can focus on your food and not worry about burning it. The side dishes were yummy too
I'm not sure if it's cuz I went with my friends at a busy time but it did took a little while for the meat to come out tho. But other than that it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here for many reasons. First, the atmosphere is very nice. It's a small restaurant, but the decor is cute and the tables are nice. Each table has its own Bbq and exhaust fan. They start by bringing out banchan, or side dishes, and then they will cook your meat for you. If you want a more traditional experience then they will hand over the tongs and scissors to you and you can do the cooking. After watching the server cook most of our meat we decided to cook the rest. It was more fun and interactive. Just let them know when you are done with each type of meat because they change the grill face. The staff is attentive and the food was good. I was stuffed beyond belief so make sure to come here very very hungry. Price point: 2 of us paid $100 total, no alcohol, we split a beef combo and added on the pork jowl. I would rec the beef combo for sure but the pork jowl wasn't worth it and it was way too much food"}
