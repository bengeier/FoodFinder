{"text":"This place is great.  Very healthy and you can grab some juice to take home with you.  I had the split pea soup special and a salad along with the gluten free cashew cookie.  Everything was very good and the service was excellent even though it was very busy that night."}
{"text":"Best vegan or vegetarian food in this area hands down! The brunch is amazing, the quinoa fries are insane!!!! Most options are healthy, lots if gluten or dairy free meals, including dessert. The juice is also amazing. Everything is fairly expensive, but you get what you pay for.  It's crowded in here and not kid friendly, so make a reservation.  A quick cheaper option is the sandwiches they have in a cooler for lunches."}
{"text":"Super slow service. Food came out barely warm and mediocre. It is vegetarian and vegan friendly but skip it if you have other options."}
{"text":"I have been here countless times and keep coming back. All of my friends are hooked too. Delicious salads, bowls, burgers, wraps, and desserts--all vegan! Best items include black bean burrito, buddha bowl, ace of kales salad, quinoa onion rings, sweet potato fries, and the vanilla cupcake. Always busy but totally worth it."}
{"text":"I go frequently and always encounter great service and food!! The only bad thing that I can say about them is why did they have to get into a groupon deal??? Kills the exclusivity"}
{"text":"This our favorite restaurant in the city. So many of their dishes have lots of fresh tasty vegetables in them as the main focus. We always find something great to eat here.  The service used to be very slow but seems to have improved recently."}
{"text":"Not bad...service was pleasant...atmosphere  festive...I enjoyed the Thai salad...looks like they have good takeout service as well...if come back"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian by any stretch of the imagination so when it was suggested we go here for dinner I was admittedly a little skeptical. Though I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I quite enjoyed the busy, packed feel of this place. If you are looking for a quiet dinner for two go else where but beyond that, Fresh is fun, and a great atmosphere to grab a bite with some friends. The service left nothing to complain about. The waitress was by a couple of times to check in but generally left us alone (which I appreciate) and we never ran out of water at our table.   I ordered their BBQ Burger which rang in at $11 and came with only a small bowl of their marinated kale slaw as a side. The burger patty itself was nothing to write home about. It  was well seasoned but it was thin and a touch dry. It was however redeemed by the excellent quality produce on top (tomatoes, banana peppers, etc.) and, best of all, the quinoa crusted onion rings. For me the overall experience of the burger was rather average, at $11 for an a-la-carte burger I know I expect a lot more but since I am unfamiliar with the general quality of vegetarian burgers my opinion my be off the mark. The slaw it was served with was another matter, it was made with quality ingredients and had wonderful texture but was completely bland. All in all it was an enjoyable but rather forgettable meal for me. If I were to go back, the bowls and wraps looked intriguing. I realize it sounds like I am slamming the food but I did actually enjoy it, I would have much fewer criticisms if the price was a few dollars lower or came with an actual side.  In the end I doubt I would return here on my own but I wouldn't object if it was suggested when out with my friends.  P.S. Although I didn't order a smoothie, their vast selection is worth noting."}
{"text":"I still love Fresh, I just have to gripe about them switching their cornbread recipe to be gluten-free. The new stuff is awful and completely bland. Why can't they have both and let the customer choose?   My soup salad cornbread meal will never be the same."}
{"text":"This place is always busy. Would recommend for 2 to 4 people. The quinoa onion rings are delicious - order it with chipotle mayo. My go-to dishes are the tangled thai salad which I add crispy tofu cubes to, the tiger bowl on soba, and the buddha bowl on soba or rice. I also love their hot sauce. I'm not vegan or vegetarian and I've enjoyed everything I've tried."}
{"text":"Like most of others, I love the simple and healthy concept of Fresh. Because of that, my friends and I have dined quite often at the one on spadina ave., but our last night experience had us think again before we go there next time due to poor service. One of their waitresses spilled the sauce on the floor, and didn't realize it also got onto my friend's back and jacket. Until we asked her for napkins, she looked like nothing happened and didn't even apologize right away. She seems to be tired and impatient. It totally ruined our mood and meal, and my friend had to keep wiping his jacket. to get rid of the spill and smell. Her terrible service overpowered the food, no matter how healthy and great idea Fresh  tries to bring to its customers. If no enough improvement in place, service like this will hurt the business there."}
{"text":"I have spent more time and money here than I care to admit. I've tried nearly everything on the menu, and not once have I ever been disappointed.   The staff are all great looking (fashionistas to boot), sweet, and ready to make a recommendation if you've never heard of tempeh or jicama. Every month there's a new salad, burger, or smoothie to try, and their desserts are to die for. I've even come to prefer vegan cupcakes to their more fat saturated counterparts.   This downtown location has been my haunt for years, but the Queen & Crawford joint boasts a bigger patio and potentially hipper clientele. The Bloor location has (arguably) more seating, but all are consistently delicious and great for a meeting, lunch with a friend, or just grabbing a bite post hot yoga session. I miss this place when I go home to the States.  My only complaint? I wish they delivered."}
{"text":"This place is a staple for me.   Healthy, so you can eat out without guilt.  I love the fresh bowls, but everything is great here.  Don't be afraid to customize your meal...add sauces, nuts, tofu, etc.  It's great for smoothies too... no sugary syrups!   The food is a little overpriced, but it's worth it for the quality.   The decor is simple and clean (a nice change from most healthy vegetarian resaurants) Cozy, great for a girlie catch-up!"}
{"text":"The food is very good but I had a horrible experience with the manager who said her name was Gertrude. I was going in the place weekly until I got to meet this fine young lady......never again."}
{"text":"I travel to Toronto for business quite a bit--Fresh is my first food stop every time. I've made a ritual of getting carry out there and I have not been disappointed yet. Their miso gravy is out-of-this-world good as is the \"Ninja Bowl.\"  I want to try other things on the menu, but I'm stuck on my faves. The only downside is the wait--I never seem to account for how long it takes them to get my order ready."}
{"text":"This brand has exploded in recent years. I had only used their juicing services in the past but decided to eat this time. Quinoa onion rings were killer good. The Thai burger was decent. My partner had some sort of bowl with soba noodles. I also left with a green juice. Overall a great alternative to your average everyday grub."}
{"text":"Overall Love these restaurants, I have food allergies and they have always been great to accommodate in delivering a safe meal for me. The fact they have a food ingredient book makes life a lot easier and gives you a piece of mind when ordering; knowing exactly what is in the dish.  The Queen location is quite noisy in the winter time but its been basically sold out anytime I have gone to be a guest. I do enjoy the Fresh restaurants a lot, especially in the summer the patio on Queen is amazing. Especially if you want a romantic touch, take a stroll through Trinity Bellwood's park afterward!   The food at either restaurants has always been amazing for my girlfriend and me, never had a major issue with the food. The icing on the cake for me has been their Almond milk latté, as it is one of the best lattés I have ever had. I usually have or even two whenever I go to eat there.  Overall I think everyone should give Fresh a chance, even the carnivores out there!!! I love meat just as much as the next carnivore, however balance is everything, not every meal has to have a 12oz prime rib, or we would all live a short life!"}
{"text":"Fresh has great juices and the salads cant be beat. Usually the service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick casual meal. Very lively.  We ordered the yukon fries (typical, but delicious) and the indian dosas for appetizers. The dosas were my favorite part of the entire meal. So much flavor. Cooked perfectly.   I had the powerhouse bowl. While good, the flavor was a bit bland and it was somewhat dry. I think more sauce would have taken care of both of those issues, though. My friend had the buddha bowl. She loved it.  I'd definitely go back and try other things."}
{"text":"I don't frequent vegetarian places a lot, actually besides Fresh, I don't go anywhere else (probably need to get out more...).  Menu has a large variety from salads, burgers to noodles as well as a bunch of things you can add to customize (sauces, veggies, proteins etc.) so you can always keep things interesting.   I had their $15 Veggielicious special which came with a Chi-Spa juice (ginger, dates, apple, soymilk, banana, cinnamon, chia seeds). My friend and I tried it with and without the date since we're both not fans of it but decided we should try the drink \"as is\" too.  The drink itself tasted like a banana cake smoothie and the date didn't add to much to it expect tiny chunks of dates that didn't get blend very well.  I'd skip the dates next time.  The Ninja bowl came with greens, fried tofu cubes, sundried tomatoes, tamari sauce and I opted for brown rice & tahini sauce. I enjoyed it. The sundried tomatoes weren't too dry and strong in taste and their was enough sauce that the dish wasn't dry. The cupcakes were delicious, you can really taste the ginger in the cupcake and the frosting was light and creamy.   This place is always busy but the line moves fast."}
{"text":"Every couple of years Fresh \"revamps\" its menu, meaning it add 2 or 3 dishes and raises the prices of all the old ones by a dollar.   What used to be an amazing deal for what you were getting now feels like a rip-off. You could make it yourself for much less.   This used to be my favorite restaurant, but now I have a love-hate relationship with it. I only go back when someone else asks me there, I don't propose it."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite restaurant ever! I've never left Fresh disappointed. No matter what you order on the menu, it's bound to be good...kinda like the Cheesecake Factory, ha!  95% of the time I get the Holiday Wrap with cheddar cheese, which is just an explosion of sex in your mouth. If you're going to get any wrap, adding cheddar  is almost mandatory because it takes your wrap to the next level! Their quinoa onion rings are also bomb!  My only complaints with Fresh would be how packed the restaurant gets and closeness of the tables. Sometimes it feels like you're almost in a cafeteria sharing one big table due to how close you are a seated to the stranger beside you.  Besides that small annoyance, Fresh is amazing! I don't live anywhere near a Fresh and I go grab food there at least once a week, thats how good it is!  As a side note, if you're a student definitely look into getting take out from them! If you show the cashier your student ID, you can get 15% off your meals! Unfortunately, its only for take out, but still amazing!"}
{"text":"It's fresh! Great healthy menu. All we had was tasty. Fair prices. Good for cooks looking for inspiration!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food with flavour. As a meat eater I enjoy this place just as much. So glad the new menu still has my favourite black bean burrito. Their onion rings are amazing and server staff always helpful. Now and again they run out of avocados (understandably so) but they always find a way to make up for it.  Would I recommend this place? 100% Would I return? Many times to come."}
{"text":"My favourite place! Love the phytosalad, bean burrito and of course the legendary onion rings. It's definitely pricey, but the service is great and the food fantastic!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific! As a vegan for the last 30 years or so, I've seen my fair share of vegan restaurants. This one really delivered on all levels.  I walked through the very unassuming storefront and the small place was packed. The hostess said something about 15 to 20 minutes and as I was just hoping to grab a quick bite to eat before heading to the airport I almost got discouraged and left. Am I ever glad I didn't. The wait was more like 5 minutes but now that I've eaten there, I will happily wait much longer next time if I have to.   I'm a pretty big guy with a large appetite so I ordered the poutine and the squash tacos. They were delicious and I can highly recommend them. I also was given a small jar of hot sauce which was unlike any I'd ever had before. Great taste and just the right amount of heat. I didn't ask but I'm betting it was house made. Finally, I washed it all down with a lemonade. My plan to have a piece of chocolate cake was foiled as the portions were wonderfully generous and there just wasn't any more room.   Prices were reasonable and despite the lineup that almost made it out the door I never once felt rushed or forgotten by the friendly and efficient staff. I appreciated the large bottle of water that was already on the table when I sat down.   I'm not sure how this could have been a better experience. Maybe if there was more room as I was sitting pretty close to my neighbours but it wasn't bothersome and in this kind of an informal restaurant really is to be expected.   To recap: great food and excellent friendly service makes it a no brainer to recommend Fresh to vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike."}
{"text":"Nice Soup, Salad and Corn Bread Combo. Great for lunch. XS coffee..."}
{"text":"Hands down the best vegan place I've tried! Had the holiday wrap, sweet potato fries and the super cleanse green juice. The holiday wrap was simply amazing, the vegetables and tofu were fresh and I didn't feel like I was eating grass which is always a relief. Got the chipotle mayo for the fries and was delicious. I really liked the super cleanse green juice as it was slightly sour and sweet which made the whole process of drinking vegetable juice a lot more enjoyable.   The service at Fresh is excellent. They were having a 50% discount and we had to wait for a long time to get our food but one of the people working there was so nice to offer us a free juice and starter on our next visit which I thought it was kind of them to do that. Well, It definitely made the wait a lot more bearable. After today, I am seriously considering to become vegan. Fresh is undoubtedly the go to place for my vegan fix!"}
{"text":"I just got home and opened my Buddha bowl (on soba noodles) and there's no tofu. Mistakes happen .. but I just paid $20 for sauce and noodles with a couple chunks of tomato. I've been going to Fresh for over 10 yrs but hadnt been for a while. This was my first time at the Spadina location. This was my last trip to ANY Fresh location. The prices were always a bit steep but now they're ridiculous. There's plenty of quality veg competition out there and with the prices and a 20 min wait time for takeout  (1 min per $!), forget it. Sad to say this as I really do like the flavours. I even bought the cookbook back in 2005! But I just can't patronize this place anymore."}
{"text":"Note that this review only applies to my take-out experience, but I found the staff unwilling to accommodate what I thought was a very simple request. I had just come from work and had work I still needed to complete. My take-away order was going to be ~15 minutes so I asked if I could sit at one of the empty tables so that I could work while I wait. The restaurant was only ~25% full at the time so there were many empty tables, but I was told that if I was ordering take-away I could not sit in the \"dine-in\" area while I waited, but rather had to sit on the bench by the door (quite drafty and not conducive to working). It may seem like a minor thing, but it turned what could have been a productive 15 minutes in to an unproductive (and cold) 15 minutes as I waited by the door."}
{"text":"Used to love this place when it was Juice for Life.  I always went to the Bloor Street location.    I was in town for a couple of days so I decided to have lunch here.  Overall I was disappointed.  The peanut lime dressing did not have enough lime and it just did not seem like the cook had bothered to taste it.  Same  with the tahini dressing which did not have enough lemon.  My big salad was Ok but boring.  Today I had the tangled Thai salad and I got the warm peanut dressing.  This was a bit better but not remarkable.  The only thing that was well executed was the Nepalese split pea soup.  Whoever made that clearly has a good palate.   For the prices they charge I do not feel that they are hitting the mark.  Next time I am in town I will look for other vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Decent vegetarian food.  Service is so so. The desserts looked amazing although I didnt have any.  I had the mushroom burger which I added 3 different condiments to to get some flavour. The indian crepe starter was excellent."}
{"text":"A busy restaurant at the south end of Chinatown and all the staff were very welcoming.  We loved the Quinoa Onion rings dipped in garlic mayonnaise! The Dosa was scrumptious. The Energy bowl with brown rice was delicious, as was the Iron Man salad. The  Buddha bowl which came in a small or large size with either soba noodles or rice, your choice, was full of flavour and a big hit. The Macro Greens is a large bowl of just steamed greens. No added flavour so be prepared for that. Overall a great experience and as a veggie in TO, recommended."}
{"text":"Hit or Miss. The carrot cake is to DIE for and is now the only thing I go back for. Their smoothies are delicious and for $10 a pop you'd expect them to get your order right and for your drink to be cold. The last 4 times i've ordered smoothies they've been served at room temperature and the last 2 times the order has been wrong. I get the smoothie guy must be under the pump as everyone in Toronto seems to be lining up to order these things but seriously get the orders right man and make the drinks COLD it's summer time. The food is somewhat average. Black bean burrito was a 2/10. Quinoa onion rings are pretty delish and the deserts are to die for. I will be back for more carrot cake but I'll be ordering water to drink."}
{"text":"Much as I used to dislike Fresh on Bloor, I like Fresh on Spadina. Part of this is due to the improvements in food quality at all the Fresh restaurants. I love the new Ironman salad, for example, and have learned to stay away from the bowls that are too much like food I'd make when home.  Overall, the salads and veggie burgers are amazing; the smoothies are good; and dessert is healthier than the average treat.  Importantly, this location has a way more diverse clientele than does the Bloor one -- less UofT/Annex, more Entertainment District/tourists/905ers. This makes it more rather than less interesting -- it is somehow more vibrant a place.   The servers are sometimes harried, but they deserve to be cut some slack. It is often packed with a long line-up waiting for tables. My partner and I like it for a very casual date night -- the tiny tables and the energy make it a good space for that."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I was only in Toronto for a week, and being a vegetarian this place was suggested for me to try. Although the inside atmosphere was nice, I got take-out. I asked the waitress what she suggested/what was most popular and ended up getting the buffalo wrap and a side salad which I can't seem to find on the menu (mixed greens with cucumbers, cabbage, goji berries and dried cranberries.. and maybe a few other things that I'm forgetting). She also gave  me two dressings to try and I really liked the house dressing while the 3*6*9 was not for me. The wrap was so incredibly good and loaded with chick'n. I wish Philadelphia had a yummy place like this!"}
{"text":"The quinoa onion rings are cruncy deliciousness.  Had the beach bowl with soba noodles which had a lot of good ingredients, but the flavour was a bit on the plain side."}
{"text":"My first trip to Fresh was delicious!  I've been walking by for over two years, popped in once, saw a bunch of tofu on the menu, and walked out. But I was craving a non-meat meal close to home and decided to give Fresh another try -- and am very glad I did!    I ordered the Baby Warrior bowl and a side of the sweet potato fries. The Warrior was served hot and it was fantastic!  The fries were good as far as sweet potato fries go. I wanted to try the tostada, but was advised that it would be too much food, and they were right -- the portions, even the \"baby\" portion, was plenty of food for one.  The staff was friendly and helpful, even with my 20 questions about the vegetarian menu that I knew little about (so *that's* what tempeh is!).  The patio was open and the restaurant was playing Bob Dylan (sweet).    While Fresh probably won't win the \"best restaurant of the year\" award, it was a great place for some fresh food.  I will definitely be making a second trip to Fresh!"}
{"text":"Ok so we were in Toronto for a few days in November and decided to try Fresh. Our friends from Philly met up with us and suggested we try this place out. I have to say that Fresh was a pleasant surprise.   We met up for a late breakfast at this location. It was busy but there were a few available tables. This restaurant is somewhat on the small side and it can get quite crowded. The staff was courteous but not too friendly. They weren't rude or anything, just not too outgoing (strictly business maybe?).   The food was excellent albeit some of the dishes are a bit on the hippy side of life (very earthy, which is not bad, just not my preference). All four adults ordered a tofu scramble variation and pancackes. My only warning is with the pancakes. The pancakes are vegan so they do tend to be on the dry side, you really have to use the maple syrup. This is not a reflection on the kitchen because I've never had a moist vegan pancake. They may be quite simple to make in theory but most places I have eaten at that offer vegan pancakes always have the same problem. The true test, however, was whether or not my 2 year old would eat them. Fresh passed this test easily as he wolfed them down immediately.  We also ordered some juices and smoothies. No complaints here, they were awesome!  Menu prices are ok (between $8-$15/entree) but you do get a decent amount of food for the price.   Overall this place was great. The only reason I did not give a five star review is because I did not sample enough of the menu."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ burger, wrap style, with a side of onion rings. Good portion size for take-out, but so stuffed after eating everything! Depending on what you get, it's either healthy-ish to not healthy at all, so choose wisely! But for a midday vegan fix, Fresh is the place to go! Their smoothies are pretty good too; I'd recommend the \"Breathless\" - a typical mango-strawberry-banana blend.   The service at this Fresh is above the other two that I have visited (the one on Bloor, and on Eglinton). The young gentleman was more than accommodating, and friendly - but not overly doing it.   As always, a joy to visit Fresh on Spadina."}
{"text":"I decided to try it out after few of my friends have highly recommended Fresh to me. I'm always on the hunt for healthy food places! I went to the Spadina location around 12pm on a weekday and it was bustling with people! I ordered a greenhouse bowl (?) and since I was tight on lunch time, I was a bit flustered that the food took more than 30min to arrive. My waitress was very understanding and she explained that lunch hour is hectic - and she offered to have it wrapped up to-go for me as soon as it leaves the kitchen. She also gave me a free drink card!  Food quality: soba noodles was a bit soggy but I assumed that it was the result of being in the bottom of takeout box. Tempeh flavour and texture were spot on. Nori was decent. Broccoli tasted fresh; it was cooked well enough that preserved the crunch that I love in vegetables yet it eliminated that \"raw\" broccoli taste that I normally hate. My greenhouse bowl was brought together by this special, super light yet clean-and-flavourful sauce. It is so darn good that I almost regret ordering the baby size as opposed to the regular! Nevertheless I felt very satiated (not bloated).  **  Two days later I went back with my coworker because I couldn't get enough of it. This time we went around 2pm and we were able to enjoy our food in the patio by the entrance. Our food arrived quickly and I was blown away by the cornbread/soup/salad combo. The portion size was perfect. My split pea soup was hearty and very umami-filled. The cornbread (with flax I believe?) was excellent and it tastes 10x better than its classic butter-laden cousin. In fact, it was so good that I could not stop daydreaming about its fluffiness and scrumptiousness. I don't know how \"clean\" it is but I was happy that it didn't leave me with greasy fingers or upset stomach (my system cannot handle too much oil/animal fat in one sitting). Though I had the Siracha dressing on the side and it was used very sparsely in my sprout salad, I was still very impressed with the freshness and variety of greens in my salad.   **  Overall, I think the food is excellent for its value and it has become my new go-to lunch place if, for some reason I didn't bring my lunch to work. It is my new favourite casual restaurant. I agree with a previous reviewer saying that it's \"unpretentious\". I definitely prefer it over Freshii and I feel comfortable taking those of my friends and family who don't necessarily care about the healthy food scene. I am by no means a vegetarian but trust me when I say this: Fresh does a phenomenal job aligning taste and nutrition!"}
{"text":"Made a Yelp account just for this review!  Stopped by after a blue jays game a while ago! It was busy when we sat in, but the food came out in a decent time (10-15 minutes?), and the service was good - never had to worry about the table water staying empty for too long, for example.  Though, I will admit that Fresh isn't the same as it used to be. Something about the staff/food/atmosphere has changed ... can't say it's necessarily bad, but just my two (five?) cents.   One negative, but could just be related to the server; this is definitely not a place where you want to hang around for too long after you're finished your food/drinks. I get this itching feeling that the our server really wanted us to leave."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are pretty big meat eaters. As well as being fans of things fried and greasy. After eating two gigantic gut busting rotis from Gandhi the other day and having the diet that would make anyone cringe we decided we needed a serious break from routine before we set ourselves on a mean path of sluggish tiredome for the rest of the week. We decided to cut out meat (even if it was just for lunch). I like my hit of veggies and tofu every now and then to keep things balanced. In fact i grew up eating vegetarian several days out of the year because of our Buddhist household. But I've never been a fan of the western take on vegetarian and vegan cuisine. They always seem to be bad riffs off classic meat dishes or dishes that Asians do amazingly. Most of the time I find it to be over spiced, mushy and lacking in depth or flavor - things that fat and browned proteins lend so well to any dish.    To no surprise Fresh includes many these riffs into its menu, and also the problems with vegetarian cooking; from the \"burger\" to Asian-esque brown basmati rice (actually just plain brown rice) bowls featuring coconut curry sauces, pestos, and Thai peanuts sauces. Dosas, tostadas and others for starters. Also, on the reverse side of the menu, an encyclopedia's worth of drinks and smoothies.   To start we chose the tostada. A thick and crunchy fried tortilla topped with spiced beans, tomatoes, carrots and cilantro. A good tasty starter, but the heap of garnishes was hard to manage. They were piled so high and were unnecessary, spilling everywhere on my lap and table. We left most of the shaved carrots and cilantro on our plates. For our main we shared the BBQ burger, a protein and nut patty topped with quinoa crusted onion rings and BBQ sauce and the Energy Bowl, brown rice with a vegetable stew,with a coconut curry sauce and veggies. The burger we had had before. It was always good, textually varied, and huge. The BBQ sauce was always balanced and the onion rings are still my favorite in the city.  The Fresh Energy Bowl however conjures up different feelings. It reminded me of what that new-agey 17 year old girl, fresh out of high school , living on her own, with minimal cooking skills, would make for herself at home on a lazy afternoon. Dumping ten fist fulls of cumin into her vegetable stew, raw, without thinking to brown it or even brown her veggies and letting it boil away into oblivion. The mush is then ladled over rice, topped with cucumber and tomato and pea shoots. Finished off with a coconut curry sauce, that looked a little to close to off-white ejaculate. It was a $12 mushy mess. And the surprise to me was that, looking around, most people, for the most part seemed to be eating these bowl things with enthusiasm. These Fresh Bowls which according to the menu were only slightly varied by their ingredients and sauces are baffling popular. Why is this a good idea!? They, to me, are KFC Chicken Bowl's vegetarian equivalent, but at twice the price. Stay away. Stay far far away from these things.  I will come back, but I've learned a lesson I will not repeat."}
{"text":"The $6.50 rice bowl special is a great deal and surprisingly filling. I love their quinoa-covered onion rings, but their veggie burgers seem to fall apart as they are very dry. Good service overall, but the tables a bit too crammed together. Also, it's not really a place to linger over a long meal; I always feel rushed and kind of like I'm in a food court or cafeteria."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't get 5 stars! I love this place and have been coming here for years!   I have to admit that even know I eat healthy, I'm no vegetarian and only come here after a night of hard drinking as feel good food. well I would even go as far as to say I love meat and I rarely find any meatfree dish I like before coming here but this place changed my mind!   I love their curry dish on soba noodles and their green detox juices soooo gooood! I always get mine with deep fried tofu just to be a little bad. Their onion rings are the best as well yum yum! What not to love about this place. I didn't feel like I was missing anything eating this. I didn't miss the meat one bit!   Tip: always a lineup there so don't go there starving. People who eat there take their time eating. but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre food & indifferent service.  A disappointment."}
{"text":"Meh is the perfect way to describe it. Food wasn't all that good but there was lots of it and service, while friendly, was sloppy and extremely unprofessional.  It was packed when we got there so while we were waiting for our table I ordered a Blue Lagoon smoothie. It was decent but not particularly memorable . It had a good balance of blueberries to banana but lacked a bit on the mango.  I was with a very large group (15+ people) but the food came at an acceptable pace. I started with the grilled cornbread and vegan butter (the butter I ordered for the sheer novelty of trying it). The flavour was good but it was a bit dry and crumbly although the butter held it together well enough.  I had the regular soba energy bowl as my main. It started out pretty tasty but after the first few bites the mix of tahini and coconut curry just sort of melted into a vaguely salty thick mush. The noodles were a tad overcooked for my liking but the sunflower sprouts were pleasant. While the taste was hardly top notch the serving was more than generous.   The real let down was the service. Our waitress, like so many others, disappeared once we had our mains. When we asked for the bill she said she couldn't split it (yes, we should have specified this first) and spent 30 mins getting us to figure out how much we each owed and when we thought we were settled she came back and said we were $50 short. After another 20 mins of checking the bill it had turned out that she had punched in our orders wrong and we did not in fact owe any more money.   So I guess if you're hungry, vegan, and very patient this is your place to go."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but I love the food here!  The flavours are all very innovative and I always leave feeling very satisfied.  The only thing I would change is a having a bit more sauce with the Soba noodle bowls."}
{"text":"Updating my rating to 3.5 stars I went there on the weekend with some friends. The service was very friendly and we actually got service, so yay! None of my friends were vegan or vegetarian, but we all enjoyed it.  AND I opted to NOT get a rice bowl. I went instead with the megalife salad. Tons of veggies, and a great variety of veggies with an awesome dressing. Unbelievably delicious, and I felt like I was getting a lot of food. All my friends got rice bowls, and they enjoyed them a lot. Although it was agreed that while there was a ton of rice, there wasn't really a lot of veggies. I cautioned my friend against the baby bowl after my experience last time. My one friend ordered a rice bowl that came with a bunch of chopped onions. That was not listed in the menu, and she hates onions, so that was a bit unfortunate.  Still very pricy, but I would definitely go back for that salad again."}
{"text":"When visiting Toronto I made a point to go to Fresh as I have heard such good feedback about their food.  This place has huge selection of smoothies, power shakes juices and other drinks. As for the food options there is soup, salad, fries, wraps and bowls. I ordered the Buddah Bowl which was brown rice, veggies and tofu in peanut sauce very tasty. My dining companions and I all shared the sweet potato fries as a starter because we were starving....some how their sweet potato fries are better than most I've had, not sure why. Found this restaurant to be very noisy, staff was warm and friendly"}
{"text":"We were there when the restaurant was pretty much packed, which explains the slow service. But the acoustics in the restaurant were bad, and we were seated centimeters away from  two groups of people training for the mid-continent profanity-and-yodeling championship. We could certainly hear them, just not ourselves.  There was also a continual steam of couriers coming in to pick up, which was distracting as well. All-in-all, a rushed, noisy, unpleasant experience, we couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the city! Everything I have ever eaten here has been DELISH! I don't know how they do it, but I am in love with everything on the menu. You will not be disappointed. I usually get my meals to go and it is nice and easy to do so. They have a cash at the right side and the wait is usually around 15 minutes. They have a nice patio for eating outside in the summer. The juices are great too! Everything is top notch :)"}
{"text":"Ordered take away from Fresh for lunch and it was delicious! As a big meat eater I can't say I'm into veggie restaurants but this place is the best.  Ordered a cold press mad chocolate drink. Perfect blend of cacao and almonds. I also ordered the powerhouse bowl. I love that there is a baby sized bowl with one cup of rice. Yummy blend of rice, tofu, avocado and chickpea. I recommend this pace to everyone! Service was quick!"}
{"text":"Fantastic vegetarian/vegan restaurant! I bring my meat loving friends here, and they are all impressed with how good the food is.  The desserts are awesome too - try the fudge cake! SO fudgy and rich and completely vegan!!!"}
{"text":"my go to vegan/vegetarian place to go eat when i'm downtown with my vegan sister. love this place so much, always craving their food. their food is so filling and they give you so much. my favourites are the powerhouse bowl, the bbq burger and their onion rings. would recommend to anyone even if they're not vegan. always looking forward to coming back here."}
{"text":"I've been vegetarian for a month now and my friends have been raving about how great this place is - so it's only fitting that I try it out considering my new diet.  I ordered the 'Holiday Wrap' which came with marinated tofu, avocado, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, red onion, alfalfa sprouts, carrots, jicama and garlic mayo. It came with a small side of kale slaw. It was quite tasty and filling considering it was almost pure vegetables. The flavours really popped out - I just wish it there was more garlic mayo.  It is a bit on the pricier side but you're paying for quality and wholesome natural ingredients, so it's well worth it. I hear the burgers are great so guess what I'll be trying next?  Oh, this place seems to always be crazy packed during the peak hours with a line up so come during off hours!"}
{"text":"I prefer my vegan dishes simple and delicious. Health is more important than flavor. Fresh didn't disappoint in either arena. I got a baby sized \"Energy Bowl\" with soba noddles. It was chock full of flavor and protein. The waitress was very attentive and helpful in helping me making the decision to order it. Everything on their menu sounds so appealing! After seeing another couple in the restaurant order spring rolls, I had to have them. They were HUGE. Needless to say, I was full. Full for the entire day (this ended up being the only meal I had). Baby sized was just right for the noodle dish ;). The decaf americano I ordered was also a dream come true. (oh, and I happen to LOVE room temperature water) While every review I've read here complains of the prices, I found them to be average for vegan food and since I ended up eating nowhere else that day, actually cheap. I'm very excited to see that a Fresh is located but two blocks from my hostel. See you there later today!"}
{"text":"Smoothies and juices are amazing. But the customer service is very poor. The girl who took our order told us that they're  going to call my name when it's ready. We were waiting for more than 10 minutes for our orders and I saw our drinks sitting on the handout bar.  seriously!"}
{"text":"This fresh location is good, but probably my least favourite one. The amount of seating is more limited and the service is slower. The washroom is such a hassle, since you need a key to get inside. There are two stalls inside and the restaurant has two keys. But, both keys are left inside, a line will slowly form and unsure whether someone is inside or not. Very inconvenient.  The food and smoothies are the same as all the other fresh locations."}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ burger. Quite liked it.  It was quite huge so had a little trouble eating.  The quinoa crusted rings were amazing.  Overall,  I definitely recommend truing it out. This place is always busy.  They've got some great juices as well"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian Restaurant in Canada. Only 3 locations in Toronto. Try the sweet potato's as a starter. Everything here is excellent fresh prepared. Waits can be long a times. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"**3.5**  For Christmas, I'd like my own personal Fresh chef in my pocket.  Fresh has done an excellent job reaching out to the general carnivore with their mainstream vegetarian dishes. I have been to Fresh countless times and I am always recommending it to new friends.  The layout of this particular Fresh on Spadina is similar to that of Fresh on Bloor but I find it a little more spacious and the service may be just a tad better. They're pretty good at both locations, though. They're also a smart group of people, cutting down time wasted waiting for the server to pour some water and wander over - they've always got jars of water and cups ready to drop off at your table as soon as you arrive. Just watch out during lunch and dinner rush times and if you go with groups - it gets pretty crowded everyday.   My most recent trip there I tried the Beach Bowl. It was abso-fricking-lootely amaaaaahhhhzing. I ordered it because the menu named off a whole slew of vegetables and sounded like the best of all worlds with grilled red peppers, zucchini, sweet potatoes (!!), alfalfa sprouts... and lets you choose between a marinated tofu steak and goat cheese! I went with the tofu steak - I think it was possibly the most flavourful, well marinated tofu I have ever tasted. All the veggies were served on a rice with olive oil drizzled all over, which made it so yummy. They really took home all the points on flavour with this bowl. I will say however, the sweet potatoes could have been a little softer, imo - but that's really my only criticism on the dish. Oh, and that they use way more oil (albeit olive) than I would ever use on a dish, but so does any other restaurant.   The Beach Bowl is definitely a keeper. It is a must-try bowl!!!  Also, the Black Bean Burrito - one of my all time favourites. Just had to give a plug ;)  Atmosphere - 3/5 Service - 3.5/5 Food - 4/5 Value - 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Great food but always busy. Even the low period times are super busy, so I can't imagine what the high peak periods are like."}
{"text":"I just spent an evening with food poisining. I had the soup/salad/cornbread combo. Soup was carrot lime. Salad was edamame. I'm a musician and this was my pre-show meal. I thought I was doing something good for myself. Turns out something in the ingredients was bad or dirty. I had to bow out of the show. Just thought if let everyone know. Might not be so \"fresh\" at FRESH."}
{"text":"Had a deluxe burger and it was amazing. The meal was perfect. We also picked up a sandwich and a salad from their take out for the next day. Since we bought it after 5 pm the sandwich and salad were half off."}
{"text":"Healthiest fast food joint in town. Love their menu and their food is amazing! I go at least twice a week!"}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: $10ish for baby sized entrees (which IMO is the PERFECT size for the regular person). I really loved the Dragon. I was pleasantly surprised the the quality of the dishes here for a vegetarian restaurant.  There is a lot of stir-fry (a staple for Chinese cuisine) so most entrees are served with chopsticks. The quinoa onion rings are to die for.  Portions are just right!! My only issue was that my entree was drenched in sauce (it was a good sauce, but it was like a soup near the end).  The solution, ask the waitress to tell them \"easy\" on the sauce. Second, was that I asked for some extra cilantro and was told I'd be charged an additional 50 cents for it, so I passed. The second time I went, the dish didn't even come with cilantro, so when I asked, they gave me a huge bowl (double the amount the first time).   Facility: Noisy and crowded. I'm stilling nearly elbow to elbow with the party next to us and can definitely hear what they're talking about.  Washrooms are okay, typical of downtown. Wait time to be seated was minimal but the place was pretty packed.  Service: Left much to be desired. The waitress(es) did their job at the bare minimum but I was not at all impressed by any of it. The bill also took forever to get there and then forever to get the change. Also not impressed with the sass I got after asking about my food (which took over 20 minutes to arrive).  Overall: A great place to eat when you want to change up the pace.  However, it is crowded and don't expect phenomenal service.  You'll be going for the food."}
{"text":"There's several things I really like about fresh: The list of always-organic foods they use, which is something I really appreciate and one of the reasons why I do visit (I don't really like to eat out too often) They have a big menu, so you can always try something new, which I really like to do! The list of beverages is also huge! Nice, laid-out atmosphere but with style!  It's often quite overcrowded (but I think they managed, hands-off, the best use of space for a restaurant) and sometimes you can have loud neighbors (just hope they're done soon), however you're usually seated in 20 minutes at most, even when it's packed. I think the service is quite nice overall!"}
{"text":"Its very entertaining to just look at the strange looking vegans that hang out in thus place.  They are a weird breed of hipster meets tree hugger meets hobo bohemian.  That aside, the food is pretty good, if you are going meatless.  I like the soups and juice, smoothies.  Prices are good and so us service.  Check it out."}
{"text":"My friend got me hooked on the All Star salad here and I have one thing to say...NOM. It's a bit expensive for a salad but definitely worth it. I can't speak much regarding the service because I always order take-out but I definitely recommend trying Fresh if you're in the area. They have healthy options that are actually delicious!"}
{"text":"Just okay. Seems a little over-hyped in the community. The table service is alright but they seem to constantly have new counter staff with a super high turnover so things can get forgotten easily, and food quality is inconsistent.    Make sure you check your take-out orders because twice I've had things forgotten that I paid extra for!   -Their chocolate peanut butter shake is good but quite liquidy."}
{"text":"For those who poo-poo at the thought of going to a vegan restaurant (like my boyfriend, I'm still working on it...) Fresh is full of options at a great price point.  I am definitely not by any means a vegan or vegetarian, but Fresh makes me feel like I could be.  The food is simple, flavourful and.....fresh, ironically.  There are some great twists on favourites like onion rings, salads, burgers and damn if these aren't my favourite sweet potato fries in the city...with a side of house mayo, yes please!  I've always been beyond satisfied with every experience at Fresh, be it food, service or any of the juices/smoothies available. The seating is a little crammed at times, but I live in Toronto, I get it.  ....the one thing I will note: I'm not sold on the desserts, though I'm not an after dinner dessert person, so I won't include that into the rating."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, Fresh is a place I desperately want to love, but it somehow always falls short. My two problems with this place is that everything is overpriced for no reason and everything is just a shade under being \"flavourful\". I can find a better veggie burger deal in a pub just down the street or in a restaurant right beside Eaton Center (which is arguably a more pricier location than Fresh's) with all the fixings.   Now, I wouldn't even mind paying $12-13 for a burger (no sides) if it was damn amazing burger... sadly, this is not. Nothing on their menu is particularly spectacular. I still visit here from time to time because I want to support businesses that focus on vegetarianism and veganism, but the taste and price leaves something to be desired. Hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom.  Been there on a friend-date, date-date, took my parents there, had take-out. All was well. Its a busy busy place though, some shoulder rubbing may happen."}
{"text":"Favourite place to grab something refreshing. Love their squash tacos paired with my own juice creation!"}
{"text":"I came here for takeout and ordered the Quinoa Battered Onion Rings. A late night snack.   It's deep fried so it doesn't qualify as healthy no matter how you cut it. :)  Different than a conventional onion ring the fried quinoa has a dark super crunchy grainy texture. When you bite into the ring, it literally shatters to pieces. Cool!  They give you about 8 large onion rings in a paper container. They are so good I wish I had more. Interestingly they leave a clean oily not greasy after taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"Fresh has amazing salads and wraps that make for a satisfying and nutritious lunch or dinner. The restaurant lives up to its name by using the freshest ingredients and specialty sauces and dresses, including vegan mayo! If you're looking for a yummy salad with more than iceberg lettuce and a few tomato slices, Fresh is the place for you. I thoroughly enjoy their all-star quinoa salad with sweet potato, tofu and goji berries, as well as the mega life salad loaded with the nut and seed mix and spinach, topped with either the house dressing or peanut lime dressing. If you're really feeling ambitious, try the Swoosh smoothie - peanut butter, chocolate and banana deliciousness!   Fresh is usually packed and for good reason. However, we have never had to wait too long to get a table, though this may be different if you are a large party. My only criticism about Fresh is that they don't readily offer nutritional information for their menu items. While ignorance is bliss, I (and I'm sure others) would love to know how caloric or protein-rich some of the items are.   All-in-all, a great pick that will leave vegetarians smiling and even carnivorous-types craving more!"}
{"text":"I have only ever ordered juice to go but definitely want to try their food. I have only ever heard good things. Their name says it all. If you are a foodie looking for something healthy you must try it."}
{"text":"Great vegan place in Toronto. Got here on a Saturday at 6 and got a seat immediately. Friendly staff, outdoors seating and an awesome vegan menu. 2 choices of soups every day with cornbread and hummus. The tempeh bacon wrap was great"}
{"text":"Second time in the restaurant but at another location. I still don't understand why there is always so packed. 8pm on a Thursday night yet we still had to wait for seats. And the seats are so close together, when I cross my leg, I can kick the next table. I tried the kombucha for the first time, it doesn't taste bad, like frizz tea. It is suppose to be detoxified the immune system, I don't mind drinking it everyday if it was cheaper!  This time I wanted to try something else so I got the Buddha soba bowl. What a disappointment, not worth the money at all. Nothing special - soba noodles with pieces of tofu, bean sprouts, tomato and cucumber - plain, plain, plain. I could have so easily made it myself than paying $13 for a small bowl."}
{"text":"I've wanted to like Fresh, both times. So, on the positive side the service is pretty quick even during the lunch rush.   On the negative side, this place gives illusions of healthy eating because of all the words/healthy-ish ingredients all over the menu. But wow the portion size of the foods...like the bowls...even the baby bowls is HUGE and no way it's for one person. Also, if you do look at the calories and the extraordinary amounts of carbs and fats in the food, omg, I almost rather eat a giant steak - for the price/calories/taste. The buddha bowl for example is over 1,100 calories with 45 grams of fat. So that's my beef with Fresh. If I rate it as just a normal vegetarian restaurant, not focused on health and nutrition, its okay but just don't pretend you're eating here for health reasons.  The quinoa onion rings are delicious here - but I mean, I've never disliked onion rings anywhere! The buddha baby bowl was 90% soba noodles with some vegetables on top (not impressed). The beach bowl definitely was a lot more interesting with all the roasted vegetables and textures, I'd recommend that one."}
{"text":"Had a small soup and salad combo in the Sunday morning. The place is packed, but didn't wait for a long time. The service was good, and the food was incredible. I will definitely come back and bring my friends here. Yummy healthy and organic. Hope they will have a menu without any garlic, onion, green onion soon."}
{"text":"Their chocolate cake is great and so is their coffee. Delicious soups! Main entrees are very filling. Try not to eat too much!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or even vegetarian. In fact, I have no desire to permanently replace real meat with a tofu steak or tempeh.However a lot of the gluten free restos in this city are also vegan, and vegetarian and Fresh just happens to be up the street form the bf's house, so I've had it on a couple of occasions.  Last night I was looking for a place to have dinner that was yummy and near-by, most importantly I wanted a meal that would satisy my hunger without guilt or added inches to my hips... so off to Fresh we went. The memory of the warm, delicious warrior bowl I had the last time still lingered fresh in my mind, so I got it again. My dinner companion got the Kathmadu wrap with fries and avocado dip. And what a dissapointment the whole meal was.  I don't know if it was because we got there rather late (9pm) but it was almost like they ran out of curry sauce and veg stew for my bowl. So all I was really left with was a heap of rice and wilted spinach. The fries were soggy and super oily and in desperate need of a little salt. The wrap was good, not great. A little too moist, I took one bite and ended up with juice and sauce? running down my hands. We wanted  something sweet after dinner so we got two cupcakes, one choc filled with vanilla, and a choc-mint one. I had a bite of each and they were both good. Then again, I have the biggest sweet tooth ever and would eat poison if it was labeled \"candy\".   Also, the bowls are huge. I can eat a third of one, maybe half if Im really starving...so if you're a girl then maybe the \"baby bowl\" options are a better choice. I find that regardless of the size of the bowls, the food is overpriced. The meal cost us about $40 and we didnt even get drink.  I'll probaly return to fresh only because I really want to try their mushroom burger. The girl on the table beside me was eating it and it took all I had not to ask her to trade her dinner with mine. Her burger just looked so much better!"}
{"text":"Let me be clear: this place is RIDICULOUSLY overpriced for not providing organic meals. Stop being fooled. Seriously."}
{"text":"Ok, so some things aren't healthy even though they're vegetarian.  Big deal.  I got a bunch of stuff, so did my friends, and it was all good.  Highly recommend the bbq veggie burger.  A+"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and healthy! My hubby is a huge meat eater and it is nearly impossible to drag him to vegetarian restaurants, but he loves it here!"}
{"text":"Went to Fresh for the second time and their food was simply amazing. You can taste the 'fresh'ness in every single bite. The place was pretty packed but we didn't have to wait for long.  We ordered poutine, Buddha bowl and a powerhouse bowl, both with rice (the last time we were there, tried one bowl with soba noodles, but felt the one with rice tasted better). Poutine- the serving was huge. The gravy had mushrooms and the fries were crispy. Really enjoyed it. Buddha bowl - we ordered the baby size (frankly, felt the portion was generous enough for one person, though it looks small).  Powerhouse bowl - With grilled tofu, crunchy nuts, avocado, chick peas, it was delicious and very flavourful (I added their hot sauce, which was a bit 'hot'!!). The service was quick and very friendly. Not many places serve healthy fresh food, that leaves you feeling really satisfied when you are done. This is definitely one such place!"}
{"text":"During a 3.5 day stay in Toronto last summer, we ate here 4 times. I didn't try anything that I didn't like. I recommend the energy bowl as well as the shakes- shamrock, date almond and black forest cake were our favorites.   We loved this place so much that we've considered driving to Toronto for dinner, and even begged the owners via email to open a location here in Chicago. We were very gently rejected. I just ordered the cookbook and can't wait to make some of this delicious food at home."}
{"text":"When I walked by this place outside, nothing hinted 'vegan' to me. Actually, I was looking for a gourmet burger type of joint. I had vaguely heard about this place so I figured I'd check it out. Plus, on the menu outside I skimmed and read \"burger\".  I was tricked.   Immediately after walking in I felt I was having brunch on the east end of Manhattan.  Very retro designs, modern, minimalist with spunky wall colours. The crowd was a mix of trendy hipsters bent over salads,shakes/smoothies in tiny tables of 2. The heavy curtains made a really nice pop affect to the decor. Well done.   The bathrooms are to the back but you will have to get a key. If you walk towards the bathrooms and turn right, you will see the backdoor. Which is easily accessible. Call me crazy but this would only promote diner&dashers, no?  I stood there for a while and nobody came around. I did a few hops in and out. Mostly to get reception but also to test out how easy it would be to flee. It's easy.   I noticed the staff seem to hang here after and before shifts just chatting and eating with each other.   Personally I don't know anything on what makes a good vegan menu. But I was definitely willing to try out the organic beer.  I ordered a cup of the featured soup. $3.50 The East African Yellow Split Pea with Sweet Potato - This was delicious. Absolutely pureed to perfection. The temperate and consistency of the soup was perfect. The chunks of potato was just enough to add a bit of oomph but never too much. There were hints of too much ginger but even that couldn't compare to how wholesome this soup was. The bowl was tiny but it was a good app size. I don't recommend it for sharing but it's definitely worth a try.   Giving into my burger craving I decided to order the BBQ Burger W side salad. $13.00 The burger was massive. As in - you will have to cut it into 4 to be able to eat it - massive. The toppings included bbq sauce, quinoa onion rings, garlic mayo and a little salad side of  red cabbage, hot banana chilies, tomato & romaine lettuce.  - My theory is, they stuff the burger with so much stuff that you just get so full. So instead of stuffing yourself with junk, you stuff yourself with healthy vegan items. Clever. Needless to say, I was stuffed.   My bf had the : Deluxe Burger $10.00 that looked a little less intimidating than mine. The toppings included tomato, lettuce, red onion & mayo. It also came with a tiny side salad of alfalfa sprouts & dill pickle.   The light ale beer was light bodied and had less of a \"beer\" stench. I doubt you could get much out of it, but it's definitely a health conscious option for the more body/food cautious folk.   2 for brunch = 31.50 (including tax 35.60, including tip 42.60).   I have a tiny warning for anyone trying out a vegan menu for the first time - Don't read too much into it, the meals are all delicious. Look for key ingredients you enjoy (ex, avocado, asparagus, cabbage etc)  and even though the staff might tend to give off a snooty \"how dare you not know about us\" kind of vibe, they just need to know that it's your first time and will recommend a few safe starting out items based on tastes you enjoy.   fun fact:  I will NOT lie and say that it's a well fitted substitute for a burger, because it is not. Anyone that says so, is lying. To themselves. The outcome is a win anyhow  -will not starve, - you will know to introduce a cool place for your future vegan friends - and you will be stuffed healthy   ^_^   xoxo M."}
{"text":"Their hot sauce is the BEST I've had and I highly recommend the thai burger with either yam fries or onion rings."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  The soup. Always get the soup. It is fresh, filling with veggie goodness, never overcooked or lifeless. I'm convinced they make each bowl per order, how can it stay full of life in a pot all day?   Everybody can eat here. My skeptic of vegetarian anything, friend loves their vegan burger.  The fries are amazing. The bowls and salads are great even though I rue the day they ditched The Katmandu from the menu.   Food ranges from very healthy to not so much but the reason people eat it here is because it is just great food with no judgement regardless of it's veggie stance. It's also the original hipster restaurant and in spite of the hipster aloofness of wait staff in North America in recent years, the service at Fresh has always remained helpful and polite."}
{"text":"I've eaten at every Fresh location in Toronto but this location has by far the best service even under stressful and chaotic times. Servers never lose their cool. Too many fave dishes to name but if I had to choose, it would be the Ace of Kales salad ($14) which has avocado, heritage cherry tomatoes, tempeh \"Bacon\" (all vegan) and nuts. When I come here I also always get a fresh juice to wash it all down."}
{"text":"Super yum Toronto vegan spot with great sidewalk dining area for soaking sun and people watching. Tasty green juices, bowls, tacos, vegan burgers, and sweet desserts! Also located in a fun part of town."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Proceed with caution if you're a celiac.   I went to this restaurant without calling first (which was kind of my mistake) while on a trip with my boyfriend in Toronto. I looked at the menu online and thought great, they have gluten free options and it looks delicious!  Our server was very helpful in eliminating as much cross contamination as possible with what was on the gluten free menu. However, half of the menu that they say is gluten free either has gluten or has the potential via cross contamination. Which I understand, they are not going to be able to eliminate entirely, but I wasn't impressed with them putting things on the gluten free menu that would be in direct contact (for example oil).  I didn't get sick thankfully, and the food was delicious, but it was obvious that they had a different definition of gluten free than what actually means gluten free. Even though it was delicious, I'm not sure I would trust them 100% for those of you who plan on attending this restaurant and are celiac."}
{"text":"Fresh is the go-to vegetarian joint for grub; every time I walked back this location there is always a line up and when we decided to stop in for dinner we did in fact wait in line.  When we arrived, we were prompted to get our names on the list which took us 45 minutes to get seated.  Note if you go in pairs, tables turn faster.  I was super hungry and order the grilled cornbread to start.  It was not bad, a bit dry; the hummus was it came with saved the bread.  I ordered the Buddha bowl as my entree, it was a big bowl!  I had to take break to finish it - it was super yummy though.  I love the thai sauce, it paired well with the soba noodles.  We also ordered a side of sweet potato fries to share.  Their sweet potato fries are probably one of the best in the city, not super greasy, seasoned just yet - they are just slightly addictive.  Overall, the hype is worth the wait but not if you are super hungry.  I am tempted to check out the other locations in the city.  Do check Fresh out and you can judge the veggie food love for yourself."}
{"text":"I am a massive fan of Fresh. In fact, I own a \"Fresh #1\" foam finger. Strange to some people, but completely normal to me. This place is where it's at if you're looking for an uber healthy snack, meal, or smoothie.   During my frequent trips to Fresh at their various locations around Toronto, I have tried a wide variety of their items. Not exactly a difficult task considering everything not only reads like a slice of heaven, it often tastes like it too. The menu is completely vegetarian/vegan, and while I do enjoy eating meat once in awhile, I do not miss it in the slightest when I'm seated and carefully eyeballing their selection of treats. From their tasters, such as sweet potato french fries and quinoa onion rings, to massive burgers and wraps, Fresh does not f$%# around. Especially when it comes to their salads, which are knee deep and filled with anything from marinated organic tofu to jicama and chickpeas.   If you're a health nut, you'll likely go bonkers for this place. It doesn't disappoint and you'll walk away knowing you did your body some good...until the night ends in tequila shots of course."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite vegetarian place in downtown  They're usually packed and that's for a reason!  Their new menu is really good, I'd recommend the buffalo cauliflower and the wraps are good too"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the good was great! It's always great! I got one of the burgers with some cheddar and fries- very delicious. We finished our meals and our server came to clear the plates. As she was picking up a plate a ramekin of garlic aioli fell off the table. I felt some get on my leg and didn't think much of it until I looked down and saw it all over my new Sorels. The waitress brought over damp, warm napkins and my sister and I worked to get the mayo off the boot before it really sunk in. I wasn't too worried about my jeans. The server came back over with coupons and a business card for any dry-cleaning. She told me they couldn't do anything about my cider (which was fine) but they brought over the bill and I was surprised nothing was taken care of considering the damage done to my boots. Most restaurants would do so. I will be back to Fresh but not anytime soon... except for maybe a free juice they gave me. But not to that location."}
{"text":"This is my third review of FRESH. I keep updating it because the experience changes from month to month (I eat there about 6-7 times a month). I noticed that staff is a lot friendlier than in the  past. The food is still good and I believe they dropped the prices on some of their juices (but don't quote me on that).  I recommend the magic tofu wrap, the chopped caesar,  any of their soups, the middle eastern plate, mega protein salad, and grilled veggie + pesto burrito - oh and if you get the powehouse bowl - get it with their spicy peanut sauce instead of tahini. For juices, i recommend the strawberry fields with their wheat grass replacement (just as healthy without the nasty wheatgrass taste) and the liver flush (warning: this has a strong flavour from the ginger and citrus, but worth it if you plan on doing a lot of drinking).   FRESH gets 3 stars just because I've had issues in the past with unfriendly staff and a few times my sweet potato fries and tempeh have been brought to the table when they wer'e clearly burned. This hasn't happened in the last year though."}
{"text":"I had the squash tacos, a power cookie shake, and a The Healer juice to-go. It was  quite expensive all together for one person. But I was full when I left and  had good energy. I would return again to try their other dishes.  It was extremely busy during lunch and it was difficult to hear the waiters/waitresses. They would have to get really close to your face to hear you which is a bit uncomfortable. The tables were also placed really close together. I guess that's what happens when you're a busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Great, creative selection of vegetarian and vegan options. Good sized portions and the service was quick and friendly. Could have used a little more sauce on my bowl but otherwise very tasty."}
{"text":"Ridiculously long wait during peak hours, and the food is overpriced.  However, despite that, I know I'll be back.  I had the Jerusalem bowl the last time I was here, and it was far tastier than I expected it would be. The combination of flavors/textures was very creative, and well-executed. It's unusual that I feel so satisfied after such a healthy meal, so I was really impressed with Fresh for that.  One word of warning though: the Gojiccino. I love Goji berries, and I love cappuccinos. Somehow, it didn't add up. Bleghhh"}
{"text":"I should first start saying that I am not a vegetarian so this is from a meat-eaters stand point - I still love it!  There are a lot of items on the menu that will more than likely please everyone. The sweet potato fries are amazing! And you can get all sorts of different dips with them.  The Good:  1. Fresh. As the name suggests, they use only the freshest of ingredients. 2. Variety. Big menu - something for everyone. 3. Healthy. Most of their menu items are healthy as it's fresh food and not processed chemicals full of sodium.  The Bad:  1. Lines. It can be a very busy spot. Try to make resos if you can.  Recommendation: get a healthy salad and indulge in the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Excellent if pricey vegan restaurant. Definitely a find. Had the protein salad which was delicious as was the falafel salad with homemade hummus."}
{"text":"we waited 1 hour for our food to be served, and when we finally received it, it was ice cold and sloppily thrown together. the waitress was unapologetic and when we made a comment about the wait time, she just said \"that's how it is here\". at the end of all that, the food didn't even taste good. the onion rings were bland and both the falafel and tofu tacos were a mix of unpleasant flavours. I would not recommend this place and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Tried fresh for the first time and it was great. Had the tofu tacos with a creamy dip and a tiny portion of kale salad that came with the meal. It was delicious and very filling. The order came with 2 large tacos. There was fresh salsa, kale and cilantro in the tacos. The tofu was a very interesting texture.   Would definitely come back again.   The servers were super friendly. However it was extremely packed inside and really loud. It's really hard to enjoy your meal when it's so loud inside and you're trying to talk to your friends and they can barely here you.   Highly recommend the tofu tacos !!"}
{"text":"The menu at Fresh should appease everyone from a carnist to vegetarians and of course vegans. The founder has done an exceptional job with designing the menu with options ranging from salads to burgers to tacos to smoothies.   The few times I visited 2 of the Fresh restaurants in Toronto, I was surprised to see such large crowds. It is definitely a sign of changing times when people throng to a fully vegan restaurant. It is also a sign of the delicious food that is offered and a reasonable price (Myth: vegan food is expensive) and in large portions.   I tried the turmeric gold supermilk which was super with a little spiciness from cayenne and a little sweetness from orange and an overall well balanced taste from ginger, cinnamon and almond all blended in hemp milk. Slurp.   The burgers here are the best I have ever had anywhere in the world. The thai burger was unique in its taste and presentation. I also tried Indian dosas just because they had toasted coconut in them. They are not your typical South Indian style dosa but still very tasty. I have also tried poutine which was outstanding with mushroom gravy.   I really hope Ruth Tal, the founder of Fresh, opens a Fresh restaurant in every city in the U.S. soon. There is definitely a market for high quality, tasty, reasonably priced plant based food because consumers are more conscious about what (who?) they are eating."}
{"text":"Although, truthfully, I've always looked down at vegans because of all the meat they were giving up on. I understand why they do it now. There are Sooo many vegan and vegetarian options out there in the world that will fill your protein needs and satisfy your craving for grilled, bbqued and chewy food.   Fresh was a very good surprise for me and I do believe I'll be back when I have the munchies for healthy food!"}
{"text":"When you're in the mood for some real good vegan food, this is the place to be. I'm not really sure where their other locations are, but my go to is the one located off the corner of Spadina & Bloor.   Their bowls are delicious. Especially the Buddha bowl. If you're gonna get it, definitely go with soba noodles. For starters, the quinoa onion rings are second to none. Even if you're not a fan of onion rings, do yourself a favour and try them. The cold pressed juices they have here are a great side addition to your meal. If you're in a mood for some chocolate, their superfood hot chocolate will do just the job.   The place itself is quite squishy as some of the tables are really close, but you'll be too busy enjoying your food to notice.   Service is always friendly and top notch here."}
{"text":"Second time trying fresh and this time around I enjoyed it better. I got the banana date cocoa butter smoothie and it tastes heavenly!!! Also tried the green poutine which was phenomenal!! My friend got the full breakfast which looked a little blunt and sad. She only ate half of it but claimed that she liked it. I tried the tofu omelette and thought it tasted great. Customer service was decent, nothing legendary. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I love Fresh on Spadina Ave. Only a few blocks from home. The Food, staff and atmosphere is perfect and even though I go there at least once a week, I have never had a bad meal. Tonight I had the laska curry soup and was delicious!  Feel like a boost, go  for the mega life salad and green dressing."}
{"text":"My first taste of vegan food in Toronto. I had no idea that vegan cuisine was so big in the area.  The menu is huge and you can customize your order every which way you want ( for a price of course). Another New Years resolution is to eat healthy and this place sure fits the bill.   We can soon after they opened and they were getting pretty busy already as we walked in. The chocolate mocha drink special caught my eye when we sat down. The drink was rich and delish with just a hint of spice.  I ordered the All star salad and he ordered the Buddha bowl with soba noodles. We both got the large bowls and they were filling. Both dishes were rich with toppings and flavor. I wasn't a fan of the house vinaigrette but did quite enjoy the dressing with his Buddha bowl.  The buckwheat soba noodles made the dish for sure, make a warm and filling bowl. The corn bread was very good as well and my boyfriend just loved the flaxseed hummus.   Price wise, you pay for quality and fresh ingredients, with the final bill at $50 for 2 people. Nevertheless, defiantly a good place to try."}
{"text":"Heaven is a place on earth and it's called FRESH! Wow, where do I event begin? This place is AH-MAZING .  I was inToronto for a show this weekend and happened upon it in a hangry haze after a long day of traveling and shopping. The hostess was very friendly and seated me right away. Waitress was attentive and great at explaining and suggesting things off the menu. I had the Tangled Thai Salad. Fresh and light yet fulfilling and incredibly tasty. I risked missing my flight home just so I could eat another meal there this morning. Again, super friendly staff, different waitress but extremely sweet and great at answering questions and suggesting items. I ordered the superfood salad with crispy tofu and maple-sriracha dressing, it was orgasmically delicious. I also ordered an Easy Green juice and Detox power shot to take with me, again nothing short of superb. I really cannot say enough great things about this place, I wish there was one in L.A but I would make another trip to Toronto just to eat here, it's THAT good."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan but even I have to admit the food was pretty good. I got the buffalo wrap and I have no idea what was in it but it did not make me miss chicken one bit it was that good. Prices are a little more than what I'd like to pay for what it is, which is why I can't give it a perfect score, but at least it tasted good."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan restaurant! I've been to many vegan restaurants all over the GTA and this is definitely in my top 3. The bowls are delicious and super filling! I also love the onion rings!"}
{"text":"This is my first Fresh experience and yay...I'm a fan.  I had a small soup (chickpea), salad (wasabi dressing), cornbread and hummus. The dish was tastier than expected, having experience dull blandness at other vegetarian restaurants. The sauces, dressing, and dips here are fantastic -- they make all these wholesome foods \"pop.\"   Make sure to ask for the hot sauce -- nice heat with a good mix, layered flavours. I put this sauce on almost everything I ate.  Other dishes we ordered: Quinoa batter coated onion rings with the avocado sauce (I like deep fried so this was a winner), and the baby Buddha bowl (tried a couple bites of tomato, bean sprouts, and tofu and it was also good, peanut saucy denseness).  First thing I noticed when I walked into Fresh was the juices and hot beverages the patrons were sipping, so I was pleasantly surprised that Fresh also had a nice wine, beer, and cider list which was a refreshingly concise menu compared to the food/drink/dessert regular menu set out on the tables -- took a good five minutes for me to get the gist of what was gonna be dinner from this menu.  I found the seating at Fresh too crammed for comfort -- perhaps on purpose to lend to the friendliness of the place (probably out of necessity given size of the place)? Anyway, had to make several Tetris-y moves involving the dishes we ordered + little sauce containers + side plates + cutlery + bottle and cups for water + bottle and glass for the cider + of course, the hot sauce (and the other condiments), all on a little square table that was only a couple of inches apart from the two we were sandwiched between. Happy to report we made it through dinner with polished plates and only one spoon overboard.   Fun and wholesomely filling experience."}
{"text":"Really tasty smoothies and fresh salad. Definitely on the pricey side, but I've noticed that most things in Toronto cost more than in the States. Speedy and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been to most of their locations. Some of their food tastes a little too green for me but I love it none the less. Very hipster feel to it Highlights Urgen-c (drink) E3 live shot(super healthy tastes like grass) falafel(appy) carrot purree w/coconut soup Sam Houston burrito Naked burrito(AMAZING, swear I went back 3 days in a row for it). * monthly special"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a lovely Saturday brunch while visiting Toronto recently. We are not vegan, but were meeting a friend who is (and was also quite enthusiastic about the pancakes here). After spending some time paralyzed by all the juice choices, I started with a tart and refreshing grapefruit glow and then moved on to the pancakes. I had banana, my husband had blueberry, and our friend got them plain. These were wonderful, some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Pancakes can often get heavy, but these were anything but. I also got to try the delicious cornbread and some scrambled tofu and tempeh bacon. Service was fantastic. I don't have anything negative to say about this place except that it's nowhere near Utah!"}
{"text":"Eating Vegan is expensive.  Not the first time here. Tried to poutine and the holiday wrap. Both were good. Service was an issue. Server gave little eye contact. When she asked how food was she didn't even stop to ask, she kind of was walking by and said it, didnt even know she was talking to us. Food is 4 stars but service I  give 1."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, albeit on the pricier side. I've liked almost everything I've tried here: -Pythosalad: I think this one must be my favorite!! -All star: delicious -Corn chowder soup: it was more of a veggie soup (not creamy, but more like minestrone) but I actually loved it! This has been my favorite soup so far -Leak & sweet potato: I wasn't a fan, sadly -Carrot soup: delicious  The cons are: -They're VERY strict with substitutions (almost nothing can be substituted) -They're very slow (although the servers are all super friendly, it gets quite busy and there aren't that many servers) -It's quite pricey"}
{"text":"I hate this place more than ever. Their green goddess bowl is the biggest hot mess of crap."}
{"text":"This was like finding heaven!!!!! Thank you for existing!!!  Have you noticed that the bench is significantly higher than the chairs?  You are taller if you sit on the bench.  The bench also needs a back cushion."}
{"text":"Out of 4 days in Toronto so far, I've eaten at Fresh for two of them. Is that wrong?!?!?   I've always loved Fresh, but in the course of this visit, I've fallen in love with it all over again.  The service I have received the last couple of times has been exceptionally great and the food is as tasty as ever.  I highly recommend either the warrior bowl or the super protein salad. I'm salivating at just the thought of them.  The best part about Fresh is that when you leave, you feel amazing. Because the food is so healthy, you needn't worry about the 'post-eating doldrums'.   You feel good going in, and even better coming out. Your body is grateful, as are your mind and soul. Now *that* is what I call a fine dining experience!"}
{"text":"The quinoa onion rings with the chipotle dip are to die for! Along with them, I had the falafel tacos. They were very flavourful and tasty. The customer service was excellent, but the restaurant itself is quite cramped and tiny. That being said, I think it would fill up quickly during lunch hours. They do offer takeout though, so you can always do that if it's too busy. I would recommend this place to everyone, regardless of whether they're vegan or not!"}
{"text":"Fresh is pretty much my favourite place to have a meal in Toronto, and has been since before I even moved here. A stunning array of food and drinks served without much wait, little to no pretention, at reasonable prices. Note: my review for the restaurant as a whole comes first regardless of location (as nothing varies wildly), and I have a specific note about this location right at the end.  * Food - Let's talk about the miso gravy, people. It's like, ambrosia or something. I'm getting to the point where I can barely go there and order without somehow working in miso gravy to the mix. I think this will be my downfall one fateful brunch visit. - A damn good range of stuff; want something light? Lots of apps and salad, plus daily soups! Something healthy and filling? Rice bowls! Want to go crazy? Burgers and wraps and why not fries too? (Sweet tater, thanksverymuch.) - Portion sizes are EXCELLENT. - Menu pretty useful and descriptive for what you get on your plate. - Standard brunch options are great (pancake platter well worth $12), but also a great special each weekend. - Fresh ingredients, a great mix of flavours - i've not met a dish there I didn't like, because they've all got their own thing goin' on, no blandness present. Even the burgers and rice bowls which are generally a variation on a theme have something for everyone - i've got favourites and often have a hard time ordering outside my precious little clique of food. - Desserts are generally offerings from Sweets From The Earth - I can't really say I ever have room for them after a main and a drink though! I could count on one hand these times, in fact. They must've had to roll me out of there.  * Drinks - Mocha mint espresso shake and I have a monogamous thing going on; I don't even see the rest of the shake menu when I catch his eye. - Sheer wall of juice and smoothie options can be crazy - or you can go juice-lite and make your own combo - Delicious espresso, latte is divine with any brunch. - Soy *and* rice milks on offer  - Beer and wine too, but I always lean toward the non-hard stuff here.  * Prices - Look at your bill. Now look at your belly. Now back to the bill. Now back to your belly. I think you can justify what you're spending based on the fact you're about to have a food baby. - In all seriousness though, this isn't Subway or Burger King - you are paying a cost that matches the quantity, quality and flavour of what just went in that round little belly. You're worth it. - I think - including tax and tip - I generally get out of here no worse off than around $20 and i've had a meal and drink and can't possibly entertain the thought of ever eating again.  * Atmosphere - Yes, it gets busy.  - Yes, you're sitting right alongside people. This is probably not somewhere to go on a romantic date where you want to woo your lady or dude.  - I honestly have never had a problem sitting in the groups of tables (booths are nice if you can get them) - on my own, or with a few people - it's never that loud or distracting that I feel like i'm actually sitting *with* the people next to me. If I felt weird about the way Fresh was set up I wouldn't keep going back - but each to their own, this is not going to be a place to go and eat for all occasions. - On occasion i've found the music a tad loud, but it's generally a good background and helps blend the kitchen and chatter noise away into the background.  * Service - Water brought to your table without having to ask - They give you plenty of time to make your decision (especially with a menu that size) and are helpful if you have questions about anything. - Attentive but never obsessively hovering around to bother/help. - Generally not too hard on the eyes.  * Location - Spadina: for some reason, on about 85% of the visits i've made to this location they've been out of avocado. What is up with that? I often find this to be the quieter location, although sometimes it can get randomly busy."}
{"text":"Mmmm fresh!!! Sure every restaurant has it's flaws, but this locations pluses out way their flaws.  The main hostess is always great!!! Very friendly and knowledgable just what you want from the person taking care of business and your dinner.   The menu is reliably delicious, the specials seem deliciously creative. We come about 3 times a month (almost every Wednesday!) they usually chance the specials once a month from what I've noticed.  I won't lie, it's almost always busy, so if you're in a rush come early for dinner or late for lunch! Furthermore dinning here can seem like a fast food restaurant by the speed of the wait staff removing your plates and the amount of people that are in and out of here! (Fast turnover!!!)   But the heart wants what the heart wants!!! Reasonably priced and delicious veggies!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"To be fair - I've only tried the cupcakes - and I tried all the cupcakes at Fresh and I really didn't like them.  I've had glutten free before but these had something to be desired and left a bad aftertaste."}
{"text":"I have been told great things about this restaurant so I had extremely high expectations, and was slightly disappointed. Growing up in a family where things are very strongly flavoured, food from Fresh seemed a bit too delicately flavoured for me. Some may argue that it is b/c they're vegetarian, but I've had my share of vegetarian food, and none of them have seemed bland to me before (ex. tofu is an amazing flavour soaker!). I ordered one of the burgers and was disappointed that the patty kept falling apart. As a somewhat pricey restaurant (for a student budget),  I would expect them to have perfected their burger making skills so the patty wouldn't break into many pieces. However, their vegan mayo is pretty amazing, if it came in a bottle I would've bought it in a heartbeat. I also notice many Asian influences, and I don't know how I feel about it. Being Asian myself, I felt their pairing of ingredients for the \"asian\" inspired food was sort of awkward and unappealing for my palette. Kind of \"wannabe\" Asian. I think fresh is an experience that you either like or you don't like. I personally do not like it and will not be returning, but I will recommend it to vegans and vegetarians, because they may appreciate it more than me."}
{"text":"Not a vegan? No problem! Go anyway, it is spectacular. I bought the book;-)"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. When I'm not in Toronto I miss it. Get the squash tacos and the quinoa onion rings with chipotle dipping sauce. I could eat here every other day. It's all vegetarian and vegan but you don't miss the meat. The bbq burger was delightful as well. The bowls are a bit bland so be sure to add hot sauce if you like spicy, more flavorful food. Their real, fresh juice isn't filled with fruit - some places use too much apple and not enough greens. I've had several of the green juices (Super Cleanse is my go-to and Premium detox is good too) and the pink super milk is tasty (I asked them to not add the maple syrup because I don't like too sweet)."}
{"text":"I have been here so many times and love it. The Quinoa onion rings are a great starter. I always try different dishes and I've loved every one from the Jerusalem bowl to the burgers. I really love the squash tacos. The all star salad is also a great choice. I always take a cupcake to go! Overall awesome place."}
{"text":"The service typically leaves a little to be desired (slow and/or distracted) BUT the food is ALWAYS tasty, healthy, and leaves me feeling satisified. Since the prices went up a couple years ago, I find the value-for-your-money isn't what it used to be but it's still reasonable given what I feel are quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I visited my cousin in toronto in April, he couldn't wait to take me here. Going there from LA, the king of all fresh bowls n all, I was like how good could it be? Oh man!!!!!! I got the Buddha bowl, I swear I can still taste it! It was a perfect combination of sweet and sour. They added so many healthy veggies and nuts in there that made it a perfection. Next time I go to Toronto, Imna head there right when I land."}
{"text":"convenient location, although food is overpriced. much better to go to vegan cafe next door, inside Noah's. also, they tend to mix up orders, or over-charge you on the bill. so double check."}
{"text":"Best of the Fresh locations because the tables are reasonably spread out and it was dead quiet (due to the awful, business-crushing construction, maybe)? I LOVE the macrobiotic soba noodle bowl w 369 sauce on the side. The larger size is expensive but also soooo filling it's your meal for the day. Pisses me off they don't have calorie counts. Bathrooms clean and nice. Servers here don't tie up their long hair either, guess it's an overall chain bad habit"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying fresh and it did not disappoint ! We started off with juices and smoothies. Their smoothies are the best things ever. If I lived downtown I would definitely drop by everyday. I ended up eating beach bowl with soba noodles. To be honest, this would have tasted better with the rice. Was not a fan of the noodles (but tasted great with lemon).   Also they used a bit too much oil for the noodles for my taste. Overall the food was delicious, the atmosphere was great and the service was awesome.  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Love, love, love! Everything was absolutely delicious. I'm keeping my fingers crossed they open a location in Chicago. Do yourself a favor and get that BBQ burger with the quinoa coated onion rings. It is absolutely outstanding. The quinoa adds toasty flavor to the onion rings as well, and they are amazing. The service was friendly, the tea was hot and delicious, and I would absolutely go back. In fact I did go twice during my time in Toronto."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant.  The food tastes amazing every time I go and they can cater to my lactose free and gluten free diet.  Talk about amazing!  Today I ordered the Big Salad to-go.  It took about 15 minutes to get (this location is always super busy.  If you work in the area you can call ahead and pre-order your lunch so you don't have to wait.  Lunch wait times are usually about 45 minutes long.)  At Fresh they are very accommodating.  Since I couldn't eat the cheese the lady had the chef give me extra avocado.  I definitely would not complain about that.  I love avocado!  I also added Tofu to my salad so I would have extra protein.  The tofu was grilled and seasoned perfectly.  I chose their Tahini Salad dressing and it was to die for.  I highly recommend Fresh Restaurant.  They can also accommodate a kosher diet."}
{"text":"I'm amazed I've never reviewed this place, I've been here many, many times. Generally I love it. The salads are outstanding. The drinks are outstanding. The burgers are great. Where they lose stars are the bowls, which are consistently disappointing. The desserts are also just OK. Overall though, coming in for a salad or even a soup is well worth it."}
{"text":"I, very proudly, consider myself a meatarian however, upon a friend's request I visited this place. I was very skeptical at first and almost backed out of it but I am glad I did not. This place is pretty cool with SO many vegan options! The onion rings were the highlight of my visit and stole the night! Loved the sauce that was given with it and ate it without feeling any bits of guilt regarding it being unhealthy! (Maybe it was unhealthy? But in my mind if I was eating vegan for a night, I couldn't care less about anything else that was unhealthy!) The food was huge in proportion and had many wonderful ingredients/textures/flavors. I was pretty happy with the food.   We ordered a bunch of stuff, including all star salad which was very very good! I would definitely visit this place again.   Place is casual, small, but the service is fast and effective. The prices aren't too bad either!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is vegan by default and can be changed to vegetarian (add dairy products) if desired.    We absolutely loved ALL the dishes we had and would recommend this place to anyone.  We had the quinoa onion rings with curry mayo dipping sauce (how is that vegan!?).  The squash tacos are a must & we also had the black bean burrito.  The portions are  pretty large and the place was pretty busy for a weekday night.  The outdoor seating was a great place to people watch as well.    There seemed to be a good amount of street parking around the restaurant, just be sure to pay attention to the parking signs, they can be a bit complicated/confusing."}
{"text":"This is a sublime oasis for health nuts and the culinary equivalent of a horror movie for fried chicken fanatics and the like. Unfortunately, I happen to fall close to the latter side of the foodie spectrum and I can't say I finished my Fresh dinner with much joy - but of course, that is not to say that this isn't an excellent option for those who are truly conscious about what they are feeding themselves when dining out. Fresh has a creative menu with such creations as a \"green poutine\" (with a vegan-friendly variant of cheese) and quinoa onion rings, apart from the typical vegan/vegetarian fare of salads, salad bowls and smoothies aplenty. I ordered the macro greens bowl (bean sprouts, a very, very, very small helping of goat cheese that I ordered as an add-on) and the quinoa 'ringz. The rings were pretty tasty - I guess my personal mantra of 'all things deep-fried are good' still very much holds! The macro greens, on the other hand, were a bit too plain for my taste - ~$12-$13 for a box of mostly bean sprouts truthfully was less than I was hoping for at a place some of my colleagues have raved about. I am not sure I'll be back, but if you do enjoy more healthy cuisine, I think you just might like Fresh :)"}
{"text":"Im not a vegetarian, and the food is pretty good.  However, the last time I stopped in, I had a very frustrating experience. This restaurant has a policy of no outside food or drink, which I totally understand. If you walk in with a drink or something from somewhere else, they either want you to put it away or throw it out. Again, I get it. They are in the business of making money, and they want you to order things off their menu, duh.  However, the last time I dined here, there was a bunch of people waiting for tables. The hostess politely told is that it would be at least a 25 minute wait. Because of this, I decided to put my name down, and walk across the street to grab a coffee at starbucks. I was back within 5 minutes, and I went inside to let them know i was still around so I wouldn't give up my spot on the waitlist.  To my surprise, a table was already ready! So we sit down, and a manager runs over and tells me they are going to have to throw out my coffee. I only had about 3 sips of this coffee, and they grabbed it from me and threw it out.   Anyway, again, im not angry about their policy, but I am angry at how useless the hostess was for telling me it was going to be at least a 25 minute wait, and then its only 5 minutes.   If they would have quoted me a more accurate wait, there wouldn't be a problem. I don't know how its possible for a 25 minute wait to turn into 5. Thats ridiculous."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of fresh typically visiting the location on bloor at dinner time when it's packed! Today I was at the one on spadina for a lunch meeting so I didn't have the time to complain but my standard order beach bowl was far below expectation! The sweet potatoes in it were burned and they clearly didn't care to quality check each ingredient. My colleague ordered extra sweet potato instead of tofu or goat cheese and they put extra avocado instead but we were pressed on time so said nothing. Restaurant was also half empty so no excuse of being busy - I've never had an issue at fresh on bloor even with hour wait times some nights and packed seating. I love fresh but have to say something for today. Hopefully the business will read this and do something for a loyal fresh fan!"}
{"text":"Service was bad Granted it was crowded but I was told my order would take 20 min so I could leave and come back. I did and they said my order was take out and they wouldn't be able to let me sit down and eat in the restaurant I have to say the BBQ burger wasn't that good standing outside in the rain Never again!"}
{"text":"OBSESSED  i am not vegetarian and this was my first time to a vegetarian restaurant.  fell in love and went again 2 days later.  the main takeaway though is the damn quinoa onion rings! holy they are SOOO good. whatever main i get whenever I go now, I will get the starter of onion rings to MYSELF, not even going to share. note that its $6 and they legit only give u like 5 rings. whatever, well worth it!  the grilled veggie n pesto wrap is my fav. SO good! like who doesn't like pesto right?! I have tried it in the tortilla and on a bed of lettuce.  I think the portion is smaller when its not wrapped in the tortilla, but who really knows. the side of kale slaw is nothing great. The fries are also amazing here! shocker - the regular ones are better than the sweet potato fries.   The BBQ burger is also great, but im super biased cuz it has their onion rings inside, so really im going to think anything is fantastic if they shove those in lol.  the bun was DRY tho, i think it would be a good option to get the burger on a bed of lettuce instead.  Do not get the cornbread ever though, its dry and nasty.   whether or not you're vegetarian i think this is a great casual place to eat! i lovee it"}
{"text":"The only problem with this place is there are too many good things on the menu! Being a vegetarian I usually go to restaurants and have the choice of one or two items but here possibilities are endless. The theme is mostly pan-Asian with a couple other items that have no real genre.  I had the cornbread which was lovely, I finished it off with the peanut tofu burger and was full in the most satisfied way.  This place was also really well decorated and the music was great. The staff was helpful and attentive and my overall experience was really great. When I'm back in Toronto I will have to return to this great establishment."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING. I used to think that becoming vegetarian/vegan was a compromise, but everything we had in this place was absolutely delicious and I can't see myself missing meat on this kind of diet. The decor was lovely, the service was good, and in general I honestly can't think of a single bad thing to say about this place. I would come here again and again and again (except unfortunately I'm not from Toronto :'( )  Try out the Almond smoothie! Rich and awesome."}
{"text":"We've tried Fresh a couple of times in the past and the food has been consistently good. Today we ordered takeaway for Dragon Fries, Squash Tacos and Mushroom Onion Burger.  The food was ready on time and the staff was courteous. I liked the creativity with Dragon Fries (similar to Dirty Fries at Wvrst), never thought banana peppers could taste so well with fries. Squash Tacos were great as always. I felt that the bread of the mushroom burger could have been softer. Also alfalfa sprouts don't go well along with it.  Overall great food, must try."}
{"text":"At first I was a little hesitant to try a vegetarian place because, as anyone should know, I like meat.  I'm glad I did, though.  My experience with vegetarian places is very limited so I was expecting a salad that wouldn't fill me up.  Fresh couldn't be farther from the truth (although I assume they also have salads).  Like other Yelpers, I think their service is very quick (once you're seated).  Our appetizer (sweet potatoe fries) came quickly and the entrée followed shortly thereafter.  My friend and I both got bowls with brown rice and there was so much food!  It was a little bland for my taste, but apparently I didn't hear our server offer more sauce.  I plan on coming back here soon, but next time I'm coming early to avoid that long dinner-rush!"}
{"text":"had the buddha bowl salad. it was really bad. it had a lot of bean sprout, couldn't really mix everything. The tofu tasted sour and not fresh. Tomato felt really hard. I love soba noodles and they ruined it for me. Very dissappointing experience."}
{"text":"Fresh is just that!  We enjoyed our meal, just sorry they were out of cornbread the night we went.  Lots of choices for people with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I have been here before and had a burger and fries, so this time I wanted to try the Quinoa onion rings, a drink, and possibly a bowl.  The quinoa onion rings were delicious. Bomb-tastic and out of this world. Probably the best part of these onion rings was that they were well cut, full onions; they weren't the pitiful, stringy types that tear straight out of the dough. Crispy dough, really fantastic. I had it with the garlic mayo too (which lead to fantastic breath, am I right?) and this was a really good, truly garlicky dip as well. To drink, I had their \"Liver cleanse\" juice or whatever it was, and it made beet juice surprisingly palatable by adding orange juice that gave it the tanginess it needed.  For the entree, I got the Buddha bowl and boy, was I disappointed. Frankly, I was let down by all of the positive reviews of Fresh's bowls (and all the people I see ordering them). The peanut sauce it came with was far too overpowering, as was the marinated tofu that came along with it. I felt like they had literally taken soba noodles and poured pure peanut butter all over it; there was nothing else but the peanut sauce's texture that almost made my throat close up from its sheer heaviness. I understood the purpose of the little sliced cucumber/tomatoes and the bean sprouts on top was to alleviate it; but frankly, it did little to disguise how simply overpowering it just was. Even my friend (who is a health freak) found my bowl difficult to consume.  Other than that, service was fast and attentive, if amazingly hipster. The staff are the textbook definition of hipster for sure. Would come back here again, but not for a bowl."}
{"text":"They've got vegetarian fare down to a science... Quiona Onion rings are the bomb - great appetizers to share (or to have on your own).  The wraps are delicious, great hot sauce - and oh that garlic mayo - total fan...  Keep up the good work -"}
{"text":"Great fresh food.  Went to Toronto to visit some friends and since I'm a vegan I was recommended to go there.  I though the food was fantastic.  Even my friends that are not vegan loved it.  I highly suggest getting the sweet potato fries and then I had a salad.  Everyone else had a bowl and loved it.  Portions are big so come hungry or expect leftovers"}
{"text":"My fiance is about as far from a vegan as you can get, but the salads at this restaurant looked great and the dragon fries were highly recommended, so we decided to take a break from poutine to try something lighter and greener. We were not disappointed.  First, the atmosphere: this is definitely a hipster vegan place. The lemonade (which was fresh and slightly tangy, not overly sweet) was served in a mason jar, the menu uses words like \"detox\" and \"cleanse,\" and even the way the waitresses dressed gave off an \"Instagram model\" vibe. That said, it's a bright, beautiful space, and the staff were incredibly kind and helpful.  Now for the food. My fiance's detox Caesar salad was excellent. The tempeh bacon wasn't as crispy as he'd have liked, but he enjoyed the nutty flavor and the variety of textures. My tangled Thai salad was bright and fresh, with lots of crunchy vegetables a delicious dressing. My only qualm is that the spiralized vegetables are so long that you either spend a huge chunk of time cutting them down, or you stuff them in your mouth and end up looking like an ill-mannered walrus. If they would just make those guys a LITTLE shorter, it'd be a much less pleasurable experience. The sweet potato dragon fries were the real winner; I'd recommend them to anyone, vegan or otherwise.  As far as price goes, I'd say it's a mixed bag. The salads were $13 each and were perfectly sized--we left full, but not weighed down. The drinks and sides are a bit pricier, though. A single glass of lemonade was almost $6, and the small bowl of sweet potato dragon fries was almost as much as our mains. It was all delicious, but if you want any of the specialty items, you'll pay a pretty penny for it.  What makes this a five star place for me is the service. We ended up waiting over thirty minutes to get our food, and even though we didn't say anything about it, they knew it was a long wait and specifically came over to apologize to us and give us coupons for free juice. We used those coupons several days later at the Bloor street location, totally expecting that they'd give us the smallest size possible. Nope! We asked for orange juice and they automatically gave us the largest size possible. It was so fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful, if you're looking for a good vegan meal Fresh is the place to go. I have been here a few times and never been disappointed. During lunch hour expect a bit of a wait for dine in and take out but worth it, if you're heading there for dinner there usually isn't a wait, I was seated immediately and had my food shortly after ordering. Seating is either on the patio or inside both a little cramped, close tables so little personal space but if you like hearing your neighbours convo you'll be set. You will not leave Fresh hungry but do look at the menu before hand if going during lunch because it will make ordering a lot faster and easier. All in all great place!!"}
{"text":"Pretty pricey vegetarian fare and even then a few of the dishes are hit or miss. Service is okay, sometimes a little rushed. I do like their veggie burger as a healthier fascimile of the real thing and I also love their crispy tofu-very savory coating! It's good to have a healthy casual restaurant option but those prices! yowch get an main and a juice and everything adds up quickly!"}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Fresh for three years now, but today it's probably over. I came for lunch at the Spadina location at 11.40am to beat the lunch rush and I was informed by a very kind server that it would take 30 minutes to prepare our order. The management has turned all their attention and resources to take out orders (Uber Eats, Foodora, Ritual, etc). She told us the system will queue all restaurant placed orders until the take our orders clear. So here I am 35 mins after arriving to the restaurant and my order is not ready yet.   The food was fresh and fantastic as usual. The server was kind and gracious. But the waiting time spoils the experience.  This is such a disgrace - Fresh should close their retail locations and rent an industrial space where they focus 100% on their new online restaurant concept where they're only focused on delivery food. The customer experience is very very poor. Our server encouraged us to write to the owners/head office, which we'll do, but it's important for people visiting Yelp to be aware of the poor experience they'll receive at Fresh."}
{"text":"salad is good. ordered transformer as salad main. A big portion but very delicious. Tried the green smoothie including lemon kale and ginger. Not bad. Really love the cashew cookie!! amazing!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious, if not a little boring. I'm never disappointed with my food, but it is a little loud and crowded. Service is adequate.   The bowls feel like they're lacking something and are a tad pricey for what you get. The wraps are much more filling, but with less interesting ingredients. Happy to see jicama on a menu, though!"}
{"text":"First time in a Fresh on a weekend and they have brunch from 10-3pm! How excellent.   Brunch menu items include gluten free pancakes, breakfast burrito among others - all vegan.   I have to say , the pancakes, let alone it was gluten was the BEST I've ever had. Crispy on the bottom, and infused all over with fresh blueberries and crunchy almonds (2 for $8 / 3 for $10) and served with a butter (not sure if it's real butter or some soy concoction) and vegan all natural maple syrup. I opted today for two and ordered a smoothie, but I think next time I'll just go for 3.   Loved it and will be back! This probably also applies for the other locations.   The seating here is smaller than in the Bloor location, but not by much. It's cramped and close together and sometimes might be hard to 'not' eavesdrop on the next table.   I'm craving the pancakes again already!"}
{"text":"Great place when you're looking to have a casual green meal with close friends.   The food here is delicious but there are some downsides:  + The prices can be crazy. Some items have good value but a lot don't. The soup/salad combo is a good one, the juices/smoothies are whacko.  + Seating is tight. If you're looking to sprawl out, relax, and have a deep conversation look elsewhere. The strangers sitting next to you will be nearly as close to you as the people you're eating with.  + Take out portions don't match up with sitting in portions."}
{"text":"What an awesome place for fresh, healthy salads.  They also have a lot of other great and healthy meal options, as well as fresh healthy juices.  It's not cheap, but the food was very tasty.  Having eaten in similar places in New York and San Francisco, I wasn't surprised by the prices--this is what you pay for fresh, local, and/or organic vegetarian or vegan food.  Go here--your body will appreciate it very much!"}
{"text":"Delicious salads with protein mix-ins like soy beans and tofu.  One can eat hearty vegetarian meals that are especially welcome when on the road and maxed out on high fat restaurant food. Portion sizes are very large. You can split a salad and appetizer."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant after a race I was doing in the area. I gazed over the menu before coming and already knew what I was set on the squash tacos and one of their cupcakes. I got the squash tacos on a bed of lettuce instead of the wraps which was a nice option. The squash was crispy and not oily whatsoever which was nice. The kale that came with it was fresh and crisp and had such great flavors. The dressing on the squash packed it's own kick and was hot and creamy at the same time. We picked a cookie and cream cupcake. The cake wasn't too dense and the frosting was light with the perfect amount of sweetness. There were so many choices on the menu and everything really was so fresh! I wish I lived nearby because this would be a staple for me. We had about a 10 minute wait but our server was attentive and the staff was all kind. It's a cute place with a wide range of options for everyone. Highly recommend!! :)"}
{"text":"After hearing from friends about how good this place is, we finally decided to give it a try and we are glad we did.   It was very busy when we arrived. We had to wait for 15 minutes but this was pretty good considering that it was a weekend. The service was prompt and they knew theirs menus.  It took a little while for the food to arrive but I think the preparation for what we ordered could take awhile.   The portions were huge.  I had the Buffalo wrap with a Tuscan white bean soup. My friend had a falafel taco with fries. It was surprisingly filling that I had to take 1/2 of my  wrap home.   I can't speak for my friend but my Buffalo wrap had a bit of kicks but not too spicy. It was temph with a lot of julienned vegetables, a bit messy to eat but luckily they gave us a lot of napkins. The soup kinda reminds me of lentil soup.  The best part is you feel full but not heavy nor bloated. Definitely worth going back over and over again"}
{"text":"WOW - I used to go here all the time for lunch when I worked downtown......I love this place...I popped in for lunch the other day and is was packed - and rightly so...it is outstanding. Had the Thai Burger, fries with Miso gravy.....fantastic....."}
{"text":"Yum.... got the onion rings as a starter which were to die for! Tacos, burgers and bowls are all great selections but that jalapeño sauce for the tacos won me over. Delish!"}
{"text":"I've been to Fresh a few times and I've enjoyed every experience. I can eat their food without ever feeling too guilty about eating unhealthy even if I'm eating their poutine.   Most of their menu items are carb heavy. My favourites are their miso gravy poutine, quinoa onion rings, or their rice bowls. They also always have some delicious sweet treats from sweets from the earth. Make sure you save some room for dessert. I personally prefer their food items over their drinks, since their drinks can be quite pricey. Their food is also quite filling, so having a smoothie on top of a rice bowl is often just too much food for me.   Although this location is quite small inside, it does have a patio, which I haven't ever been seated at, but would highly recommend if the weather is nice outside.   The restaurant is often busy on weekends, so to avoid waiting for a table, I'll just order takeout. They're also available on a bunch of delivery apps which is super convenient."}
{"text":"I really like Fresh a lot. Sometimes it is nice to eat simple vegetable-y foods that you do not have to cook yourself.  You can find me at Fresh by myself pit stopping during a massive shopping spree - eating and eating and eating.  The juice is good too."}
{"text":"Fresh is way delicious, but the effort required to enjoy that deliciousness is way too much for me to deal with on a typical day.  My favourite meal is their deluxe burger with yukon gold french fries.  As a consummate meat-lover I never thought I would find a veggie burger that spoke to me the way this one did, but I loved every single bite of this meatless wonder.  The vegan mayo is also to die for.  Working nearby, you'd think this would be a regular venue for me, but it's not.  A) It's a bit pricey, and I try to cap my lunchtime meals at about $10.  A full meal at Fresh definitely hits above that price point.  B) It's so busy!  I guess the sheer volume of people speaks to the quality and deliciousness of the food, but I'm a grab-and-go kind of girl.  It's not really my style to call ahead, order, wait, go to the restaurant, and wait some more until I finally get my food.  Sitting down typically isn't an option.  Space is tight (and I prefer not to be elbow-to-elbow with masticating strangers), and quality food of this caliber does take time to prepare, so get comfy because you'll be waiting for awhile.  If you want to check out Fresh, check them out online first.  Think about what you want and call in your order.  Or take an afternoon and enjoy a fresh juice and a meal so good, you won't believe it's vegan.  Enjoying Fresh takes some time, but if you make the investment you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay, so I think Toronto is an okay city for serving vegetarian and vegan food.  Compare to New York and Portland, nah.... Toronto has a lot more to learn.  Anyways, Fresh is the only vegetarian/vegan chained restaurant in the city.  The food is good but over priced.  I do love their juice bar (which all range from $6 above, yakes!), once I got a watermelon smoothie with other fruit concoctions.  FRESH!  As for the entree, the burgers are really really good.  But what really taste good is the miso gravy with tofu and vegetables on rice.  REALLY REALLY good miso gravy, $12 though!  OUCH!  So after a juice and a bowl and tax, you pretty much ending paying $23 for a lunch or dinner.  Once I got really hungry but had to meet a friend in 1 hour.  I did just get out of swimming like 1.5 mile at the YMCA pool.  So I went to Fresh and got a vegan blueberry pie.  It was really good!  Though $8!  OUCH!  It hurts.  I wanted kombutcha really bad too, but seems like they are the only place that sells it, $4 too!  Made in Portland, guess how much it is back in Portland?  $1.99!!!!!!  ARGHHHH!!! Frustrating!  I will never move back to Toronto again until they lower the food prices.  RIDICULOUS!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I was so impressed with their menu I wanted to order everything!  I ended up settling for 1 thing and I was pleasantly surprised when they asked me which portion size I preferred.  How thoughtful!  It was so good and so fresh!!!  I will definitely be returning sometime soon."}
{"text":"Good smoothies but prices are high. My last experience here I ordered a smoothie and was asked to leave the seated area unless I ordered food. The place was empty. You can do better."}
{"text":"Ohmygoodnessholycrap.  Or something like that.  I completely forgot just how much I like this place. Really, just what was I thinking?     I made a stop in recently, and despite a moderate time lapse since my last visit, nothing has changed.  It's still mad busy, the staff still retain their perkiness and hipster boho outfits, and most importantly, the food was still as tasty as I last recall.  It was *almost* like finding lost love again.  (I say almost, as you might note, most of my raving reviews are for the sugared up sort, not the veggies I should be eating instead.  But, love is blind, so what's a girl to do?)   I digress.  This place is a busy little joint, tables, tightly packed in, servers hustling, slinging veg options left and right.  And I quite enjoy it.  Due to it's popularity, it does get quite packed, though.  The salads are delicious and inventive, with lots of goodies mixed up within, they are so good, I actually want to have extra tofu stuffed into the bowl.  Like, who does that?  Really?  I do, apparently.  I highly recommend the deluxe veggie burger, with cheddar cheese, the mega protein salad, and even the black bean burrito.  Sweet potato fries are great, rice bowls right on the money, and the carrot cake is revolutionary.  As my late Uncle Olavi would say, in his thick Euro accent, \"Eat it!\".  I'm on it, Olavi, don't you worry."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the food is always pretty decent. Most recently I had the Thai Burger and it was topped with a very tasty spicy peanut sauce. I'd have to recommend that one for sure.  When you order a burger or wrap, you have to order the fries separately (for about $3.00 extra) Sweet potato fries are a option.  They also have a large variety of shakes and smoothies. I find them a little pricey ($7 each). I've tried them and they don't taste like they are worth $7 even though they are pretty good. But maybe that's the point. They are supposed to be healthy, and so are the ingredients so the extra money goes towards something you wouldn't notice anyway.  But with the added cost of a shake, your wrap/burger and fries could quickly be a $25 meal by the time you factor in tax and tip."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Had soup, \"chic\" wrap, tofu salad. All good. Chic wrap could of had a bit more chic. Just a little bit more, especially with a 12 price. Soup outstanding!!  Salad was great. Service perfect. Thanks"}
{"text":"The salads are great and packed with yummy textures and morsels, but it's the vegan poutine that really is begging me to come back for more. I could eat the CRUD out of that all day!!!"}
{"text":"Having been introduced to the Bloor Street Fresh location, I expected great things. What I got was a little less than that. First off, the place did not appear to be air conditioned. It was a pretty scorching day, so some A.C would have gone a long way... Or cold water.. But all we got was room temp water... Hmmm come to think of it, they probably do this to lure you into buying their wide selection of juices.   I think I may be on to something...  The food was ok. I was accompanied by two meat-lovers and one fellow veggie (who eats seafood). The burgers sadly did not come with fries (they are extra), which for the price of the burg, you would expect some sort of side dish.  I got a wrap, not bad, but nothing special.   I'm all about finding some good vegetarian restaurants. On the occasion i visited this French location, it definitely did not deliver."}
{"text":"All Fresh locations seem not to be the same.  Ate at the Spadina location today for the 1st time and it really didn't live up to our usual haunt at Crawford.  My wife's chopped caesar was served on mixed greens not romaine, which was just kinda odd.  The quinoa battered onion rings, that we usually love from Crawford, and are usually crisp and light were soggy and greasy.  Very much like their oil wasn't hot enough :(  It was 5pm and the restaurant was busy, so it's not like they didn't have time to get it up to temp :(  In general both of our salads seemed perceptibly smaller than what we've enjoyed at Crawford.  Given the prices for the food at Fresh, smaller portions really make one question the overall value."}
{"text":"This location is very good. The soup, salad and bread combo (large) is highly recommended if you want to try a bit of everything.  The juices are a bit watery and not as great but the food is relatively good here.  The appetizer share plate is good as well.  Food: 3/5, tasty and nutritious but the portion can be a bit much.  Service: 2/5, lacklustre and they clean the table too quick, making you feel like they want you to leave soon.  Ambience: 3/5, not too bad but the tables could be set apart further; too close enough to hear everyone's conversation   Price: 2/5, kind of pricey at around $25-30 per person with drinks."}
{"text":"Ok this is a vegetarian hot spot and rightfully so  Just forget the Buddha Bowl and go right to the Squash Tacos and the Quinoa Onion Rings  You will not want any Korean Tacos after eating these.   The squash is so creamy inside the breaded coating and the spicy jalapeno mayo adds a nice kick  This place warrants several trips to work your way through the healthy and fresh menu  I am not a vegan by any means but I do enjoy great and tasty food"}
{"text":"If you're a vegan or vegetarian, then Fresh is basically the holy grail. If you're an omnivore like me, the food is squarely on the \"it's alright\" middle end of the spectrum. Regardless of your dietary proclivities, Fresh is a great option for dining when you're with people who have a range of needs. (With the exception of hardcore Paleo dieters, as you won't find a scrap of meat or egg anywhere in this place.)   Portions are gigantic. Every time I visit a Fresh location, I forget how filling the food is and end up ordering far too much food. I came here for brunch recently and ordered the pancake platter, which came with two GIGONORMOUS (and rather heavy) flapjacks, vegan sausage, and scrambled tofu. I could only eat half before wanting to pop open like an overinflated balloon. If you don't have a stomach the size of North Dakota, you may want to consider splitting your meal with a friend.   Service isn't bad, but the ambience is a bit crowded; the tables are pushed super-close together to cram as many people inside as possible. As such, it does get rather noisy. Compared to the other Fresh locations, it seems this particular one is better at turning tables over quickly, despite its relatively smaller size. There's also a small patio, if you can snag a spot on a summer day."}
{"text":"Being from NYC I always expect places like Fresh to be pricey and crowded. To my surprise when I first came here it was neither. On a nice Monday afternoon after visiting the CN Tower, we decided to walk here and have a sit down lunch.   The menu offers so many choices which is rare to a vegan/vegetarian family.  We ordered the basic burger, grilled vegetable wrap with pesto and a grapefruit glow. Everything was great.  You could taste the veggies and the freshness came through.  The service was okay but if you have read my past reviews you know I only care about food.    We felt full yet the food did not weigh us down which is a good thing in my opinion.  The food does take a while to come out but I guess that is what makes it a quality plate.  The prices are reasonable for the type of cuisine served.  I came back one more time (3 days later) around 4:30pm and the place was PACKED. I ordered BBQ burger and veggie wrap and it took over 25 minutes. It gave me enough time to pack some chutney/sauce and review the sample cookbooks in the front.  Like another reviewer said...I CRAVE veggies now and that is not typical of me (even though I am vegetarian).  I will now order the cookbooks so I can create these simple yet flavorful dishes at home.  Oh and by the way, Fresh actually made me like kale. Previously I would eat only kale chips, but their side of kale that comes with wraps and burgers is so simple and delicious that I have now bought kale to eat at home!  I am so thankful to Fresh for this change!  Keep it up Fresh!"}
{"text":"Very similar to every other healthy vegan restaurants out there - lots of tofu, tempeh, green smoothies, edamame, spirulina, fancy plant-based ingredients etc. In fact there's a Kupfert & Kim right across the street and main difference between there and Fresh is that here at Fresh you either order takeout or eat-in (must tip).   Had I reviewed Fresh last year when I was just getting into trying vegan foods I would've given them 4 or even 5/5 stars. But after becoming a 30-day vegan and switching to a full time plant-based diet, I'm no longer so impressed with Fresh's menu. Most items here are vegan with stars indicating non-vegan items, such as goat cheese or honey. We ordered the Indian dosa appetizer ($7), which came with a plateful of curry and 2 small dosas. The curry was flavorful and a bit sweet, I liked it, but the dosa filling was way too salty! Didn't exactly taste like an authentic Indian dosa, but for a vegan version it was not bad. I was underwhelmed by our mains. Partner ordered the chipotle bacon (vegan tempeh) burger ($13) and it was not as exciting as other vegan burgers we've had at other places like Thrive or Grasshopper. For $13 I didn't think it was worth it. The tempeh was cooked well, not too hard or mushy and was well seasoned. My small soup and super food salad combo was ok. The soup (carrot puree) was probably the highlight as it was slightly chunky and not what I expected when I heard \"pureed carrots\". But the soup was really bland as were the salad and ginger miso dressing. I added grilled tofu steaks to my salad for an extra $2(?) and was a bit sad that it came as literally 2 small triangles of cold grilled tofu. The cornbread and house made hummus were yummy though. The cornbread was soft, warm, and aromatic.  Probably won't be back again for a while simply because I've had better vegan food for better value at K&K, Urban Herbivore, etc"}
{"text":"I found my first experience eating here was okay. The restaurant was small and I was in a group of 6. Because were a large group, the servers let us know that there is a mandatory 18% tip applied to the bill.   As a first time patron, the menu was overwhelming. The dish names were vague and the descriptions were just a long list of ingredients. Without my friends giving recommendations, I would have been lost. Looking at the menu, and how so many ingredients listed, it almost seems like the restaurant charges based on how many ingredients there are. Even sides are an extra cost. The Buddha baby bowl for instance has marinated tofu, sauce and basic salad ingredients for $10.50 (Overpriced). They also sell 12oz candy apple juice for $11.50 (A grande 12oz starbucks frapaccino is $4.50). I do like their glass bottles though.  My Order: Squash taco $9 I Shared: Chipotle bacon burger $11.50 Fresh Gingerale $6.00  One dish without sides was enough to fill me up and then some. It was surprising but makes me think maybe prices are warranted (maybe not). The squash taco was light and fresh tasting. The fried breaded squash was sweet and crunchy with the plain salad and tortilla. Adding lime juice and spice really brought it to life. Once in a while, I didn't get a bite of the squash and the salad on its own was disappointing. The burger was dense and not very flavourful. I don't often eat veggie burgers but this did not impress. The chipotle mayo was mostly creamy and slightly spicy. The patty was slightly sweet and mushy. The \"bacon\" I couldn't find? The rest of the ingredients were very neutral in flavour. It was bland. The fresh ginger ale was very intense. The strong spice of the ginger and strong sour citrus taste was too much for me. We needed to ask for a pot of agave to balance out the sourness and even then you need a gulp of water afterward.   The service was okay, taking orders and busing were good; there was mostly someone available to help; no difficulties splitting the bill. I am not quite sure why they would force a mandatory tip rule. Just because of a few extra people in a party. Besides pushing a few tables together and splitting the bill, I don't think there is a difference serving 2 groups of 3 or serving 1 group of 6. I didn't like it when I found out that the 18% tip was split evenly for each patron. It should have been proportionate to how much each person ordered."}
{"text":"I'm not too impressed by the food served at Fresh, at least not by what I had ordered. I got a standard size buddha bowl with rice. It came with some marinated tofu, tomatoes, cilantro, cucumber, red cabbage, peanuts, jicama, great onions and lemon and cost $16.50...  I tried Fresh with the hope that the flavours in their bowls would not be something re-creatable at home but nope. There was nothing special at all about the bowl. Just fresh vegetables diced and marinated tofu. Im pretty sure that for the same price, I can make myself a week worth of these bowls at home."}
{"text":"Loved the place  BBQ burger - win Onion rings w/quinoa - sounded better than the taste Dragon bowl - fantastic lot of flavor Milkshakes - great choice  Definitely coming back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"I love fresh! Sometimes the service is a little rushed, the seating a little cramped and the bill a little more than I expect but Fresh still always gets my business. They offer an amazing menu, great staff and have consistency throughout the restaurants. After eating here I always leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"This is the first time i actually feel compelled to write a review. I was really looking forward to trying Fresh for the first time considering how popular it is and i was very disappointed. Firstly, it's the longest I've had to wait for a salad - a good 30 mins. And when i finally dug into my salad, it was tasteless, heavy and soggy. The tofu also had a weird sour vinegary taste like it was off. I had to throw it away, it was that bad."}
{"text":"Consistently wonderful. VEGGIE BURGERS, bowls and salads are top notch."}
{"text":"A great menu with lots vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options. The squash tacos here are amazing! And a great price. This place is often really busy and a bit squishy inside but they also do take out."}
{"text":"This is place is awesome!!   You must try the buffalo wrap and the poutine!!! If you are in Toronto you must try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, Fresh is maybe my least favourite restaurant in the city.  It is way way too expensive for a place that sells bowls of rice. Also, if you are going to sell bowls of rice, they should be full of flavour. Be warned: the menu at Fresh lists every single ingredient in the dish. So if you order a rice bowl with zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and portabello mushrooms, that is exactly what you're going to get. No sauce! Though you can get a side of their miso gravy (this is actually pretty good, but I love good-tasting nutritional yeast, which is, I'm pretty sure, all it is.)  Also, really, if you are feeling like something \"healthy\" stay home to eat! There are many nice ways to socialize that don't feature alienating your friends by forcing them to eat a bowl of virtue for dinner just because you don't want dairy, or meat, or anything delicious.  Also, vegetarians! Stand up for yourselves! You deserve good food too!"}
{"text":"Every time I've passed by Fresh on Spadina it's super busy and sometimes even line ups, so I finally had to see what all the buzz was about.   I had gone on a weekend with 4 other people, and managed to get a seat right away. The restaurant was already about half full at this point. Service was attentive and fast. Our server brought us water right away and gave us lots of time with the menu.   We decided on a few different items:  Quinoa Onion Rings - Crispy and light batter and full of flavour. Probably my favourite item. We ordered the jalapeno lime dip which was light and refreshing and worked so well with the onion rings.   Grilled Corn Bread - Great texture and not super heavy. The cashew cheese spread it came with was delicious and gave the bread good flavour.   Acai Refuel - Very generous size, they filled it right to the top and to the point it was overflowing so they definitely don't cheap out. There were lots of toppings.   Pancake Platter (Blueberry Almond) - The pancake flavour was really good, they put in a lot of almond flakes and blueberries in it. It wasn't overly sweet and had good density. The tofu scramble was not that great though, it didn't have much flavour.   Buffalo Wrap - The wrap was huge! It was stuffed with tons of veggies. It had really good flavours.   Ultimate Falafel Salad - I asked for no tomatoes and in turn they offered me extra falafel for free which was a plus. The salad was very big and give you lots of toppings. The salad dressing worked well with the salad and the falafels were very tasty. The only negative for me was the greens itself were a little bitter for my liking.   Overall the service was quick and friendly and attentive. They are very generous with portions and over flavours were very good for it being vegan. I would definitely come again as they have so many different items on their menu I'd like to try!"}
{"text":"The food here is without a doubt amazing, if it's you're first time trying out this place I would suggest the quinoa onion rings or their poutines. I've had some of their burgers but I felt that they were a little too dry and wouldn't order it again.   Nonetheless, I hate the customer service here, all the times I've been to this location I find that the waitresses put ZERO effort into giving us any proper service. I also once wanted to order soup but god forbid I asked a different waitress other than mine and she corrected the way I named the soup and said I'm not your server i'll get yours and then stormed off. Like helllooo, I am so sorry I wanted soup. Please forgive me."}
{"text":"Great healthy food.  Tons of choices, from food to shakes.  They have amazing sweet potato fries and onion rings.  One downside was that I found it a little too pricey for the portions you get"}
{"text":"Everything I have ever tried here is delicious. This is healthy food worth traveling for. I have the Indian Dosas last night and it was definitely sufficient for a small meal. This place is totally affordable unless you order beverages-- juices and smoothies can cost as much as the meal, doubling your bill."}
{"text":"Really great ingredients, I ordered a salad and it tasted so fresh and high quality. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Tiger with Soba Noodles was phenomenal. I couldn't put my fork down. Ingredients were fresh and the noodles were cooked perfectly.   The full size is a more than generous portion and the dish went well with the Beet Root Frappe."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. I ordered a naked burrito and loved it. The flavors all together were great and the portion was enough to bring home. I also had the onion rings with the avocado chipotle dip and I loved it. The onion rings were perfectly cooked. I went back the following day because I enjoyed it so much."}
{"text":"Always passed by it since it's near my office but never tried it until this passed weekend.  The first thing I'd like to mention is that it's not the biggest place but the food sure makes up for it. The service was great and the food came quick.   I had the Falafel Tacos. They are delicious! The Falafals were fresh, crispy on the outside but soft on the inside combine with the sauce, greens and shell it't the greatest combination. If you decide to pay a visit, it one item on the menu you must try.   I will be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"I had been going to fresh since 1999, when nothing similar existed. I've had their salads, bowls, deserts, hot drinks, cold drinks, sweet potato fries with miso gravy, cornbread + hummus, and more. I noticed:  1. delicious food 2. I got diarrhea after every single one of my 25+ visits when I'd order a juice  3. the food is not organic 4. I don't see any evidence of GMO-free food -- they use canola, corn and soy 5. they water down their fresh-made juices and smoothies 6. this is not healthy vegan/vegetarian; they use soy, canola, corn, nutritional yeast, deep-frying, etc. 7. this is kinda the Red Lobster or Burger King of vegan/vegetarian food 8. they have fantastic names for their dishes and drinks which always made me order a fresh juice, an entree, a dessert and a hot drink.  there's LIVE, CrudaCafe, SuperfoodEateries and so much more now for healthier and still delicious choices."}
{"text":"Since discovering Fresh a few months ago, I've been almost once a week.  I'm not vegetarian, but it has quickly become one of my favourite dining destinations for a healthy meal. I can't get enough!  I'm a huge fan of the holiday wrap (with crispy tofu and white cheddar) paired with any of the tasty, homemade soups.  I also love the bbq burger, a very filling veggie burger topped with bbq sauce, quinoa battered onion rings, banana peppers, and vegan mayo.   I would also recommend the buddha bowl with soba noodles, topped with tofu, bean sprouts, cucumber, tomato and peanut sauce. It was so big I couldn't finish it- next time I'll order the \"baby\" buddha (half portions are available for all the Fresh bowls).  I recently tried the spring rolls- at $8 for 2 large rolls, they're a bit pricey, but very tasty!  I was a bit hesitant to try the vegan carrot cake with cream cheese icing for dessert, but it was actually DELICIOUS. You won't believe it's vegan!  Most of the time the service is very good. I find that it's better at the Queen West location than the Spadina location. One pet-peeve of mine is that they frequently are out of avocado, an integral ingredient in the holiday wrap....but this only constitutes a minor blip in an otherwise consistently positive experience!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and the place is packed. Sweet potato burger was delicious and vegan poutine is some of the best I've tasted!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm not vegan but I still love this restaurant!!!  First of all, the food at Fresh is DELICIOUS. No, this restaurant is not the same as freshii (you'd be surprised how many of my friends made this mistake) and no, vegan food is not just salad.   I really recommend the banquet burger or the bbq burger; if you're craving a burger this will definitely satisfy you (even though it's completely meat-less). I also recommend the onion rings with chipotle sauce, trust me it's really addictive.   If you're in the mood for something more healthy my go-to is always the Buddha bowl (the baby size bowl is more than enough) with rice. Something about the peanut sauce mixing with the rice and the veggies is just magical honestly"}
{"text":"Note: This review is strictly based on the food at Fresh and not the juices and such.  First off I'm not a vegetarian but can appreciate a good vegetarian food when I have one and the food at Fresh was VERY bland (yes even for vegetarian food).   I had the dragon bowl with the noodles and the sauce and vegetables and tofu had next to no taste (a little marinade with the grilling would go a long way). There was however some bean wrap (starts with a K) that was pretty tasty but that was pretty much it from the bunch of items we had on the menu.   The place looked alright, but was far too expensive for the sub-par food (my dragon bowl was just $14 for sub-par fast food almost). Not only that but maybe they should've moved the juicer to the back or got someone who knows how to juice considerably haha. The juicer man kept freaking the bejezus out of the whole restaurant everytime he stuck a fruit / vegetable in the juicer and the thing would give out this awful extremely loud noise that would shut the whole place up and it would become awkwardly quiet.  Anyways I give this a 2 stars for expensive sub-par fast food, uninteresting (overdone) design, and food creation tactics. It seems the chain is just trying to catch on to the healthy vegetarian food craze and make as much money as they can while sacrificing originality and good food in the process."}
{"text":"Traveling solo, I enjoyed taking myself on a little vegan tour of Toronto. Fresh on Spadina was by far my favorite restaurant. I ended up eating there several times. The elixers shots, nut milks, juices, salads and bowls are all so incredible. They use many fresh ingredients and the creativity of the menu make it well worth a splurge. The portions are huge and it's definitely not overpriced, you pay for the excellent food quality you get."}
{"text":"It's vegetarian. What's more to say!"}
{"text":"I've found that, somehow, I constantly turn to Fresh for a meal, perhaps because a large number of my friends happen are vegetarian but it's more likely because I've rarely been disappointed and it's an obvious choice for a healthy meal.     I've had the squash tacos twice, as I LOVE squash. It's always a great combination of crispy squash and tangy sauces. However, I'd avoid this option if you are trying to eat healthy, with the deep-fried squash and creamy sauces; I think it's the whole wheat tortillas that help this item \"healthy enough\" for the menu.   Fresh salads are amazing and are surprisingly some of the most filling items on the menu with incredibly generous portions. I always opt for the Sriracha Maple dressing, which gives a great kick, even though I always end up pouring too much in which means I have to down 5 cups of water.   The only item I've been disappointed by is the Buddha Bowl, which is why I took a star off. I was looking for a light meal but stupidly mixed all the peanut sauce into the dish as soon as it arrived in front of me (recurring theme here). Would recommend that you ask for less sauce as I'd compare the taste and texture of this bowl to ramen - very thick and filling, not what I wanted that day. However, my friend claims that her favourite item on the menu is the Buddha Bowl with soba noodles. I'll be back soon to give this another chance."}
{"text":"I have been to Fresh on many occasions, but this was my third time and this specific location, and this review will be based on the specific visit.  I came here with one other friend for dinner around 6pm on a Tuesday evening. We know that Fresh can get busy and does not take reservations, so we decided to come earlier as opposed to later. When we arrived the restaurant was about 80% occupied and there were still a number of tables available. Despite this, the hostess said it would be a few minutes wait and she took our names. We were a bit confused because there were clearly empty tables available for parties of two. Nevertheless we were seated about a minute later.  This restaurant is jam packed. Don't come expecting any privacy at all. Our table was literally no more than four inches apart from the gentleman dining beside us. Every time I come to this location without fail someone at the table beside me (or myself) knocks something off of a neighbouring table when entering or exiting their seat.  Our server was pleasant and described the soups of the day for us and explained that they were out of the special of the day. I appreciated the she ensured we always had enough water at our table because I can find that they sometimes forget to do this at Fresh.  My friend and I both ordered our go to dishes. The macro greens on steamed greens (no sprouts, extra sweet potato) with chickpeas on the side for me and the baby beach bowel on rice with a side of corn bread and hummus for my friend. These dishes were both received as expected and we were pleased. I also asked  for their hot sauce because I love spicy food. Usually I love the hot sauce at Fresh, but this time it was a bit disappointing. It was not as spicy as usual and I had to cover my dish in it to get any sort of kick. I went through about 3/4 of the pot!  Overall the meal was generally as expected and we left satisfied."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I came here to catch up with a friend and we got a spot on the patio. Delicious food, variety of options and amazing service. Food came quickly and service was very friendly! I got the all star salad while my friend got the squash tacos AND bbq burger! We loved our food and will be coming back to try more food!"}
{"text":"First meal in Toronto, restaurant is almost full even at 3 pm, love the chill city.  I ordered the signature Buddha bowl with soba noodle, and \"all star\" salad with peanut lime sauce.   The salad is phenomenal, even my meat-lover bf loved it a lot, the sauce is nutty with a fresh light flavor, kale is chopped with the right amount of crunch but not too chewy. Grilled sweet potato, cilantro, sunflower sprouts, tofu steaks, love every topping  The Buddha bowl recommended by a lot of yelpers are quite good, but a bit too creamy and seasoned too salty for me. Maybe my palate is still too Asian ^^  Juices looks great as well, hope I can try in the next few days"}
{"text":"We had the weekend brunch.  Good selection.  Food was nicely presented.  It was obviously made fresh.  Service was very good, even though they were very busy."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for some good veggie food on a Monday evening and it was super busy. The server offered to get us sweet potato fries since the wait was so long but those came out very bad (sorta like the end of the batch). Not real impressed by the food. I got a wrap with tofu and it was not seasoned whatsoever. But the drinks were good and servers were attentive as they could be."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the city - surprisingly filling meals, delicious smoothies and the best vegan baked goods. Great for weekend brunch or a quick dinner, but wait times could be up to 20 minutes on busy evenings. Personal favourites are the Beach bowl (with soba noodles, which gives you a larger portion than the rice option), Sam Houston burrito (best wannabe-meat wrap on the menu) and All Star salad (some of the other salads are mostly just greens, so beware).  I'm not vegan, but don't eat much meat, so perhaps the reason I like Fresh so much is that I can live off noodles, tofu, and veggies. This definitely isn't the place to bring your boyfriend or carnivore friends. Nice patio for the warmer months, polite waitresses, and good variety of daily specials."}
{"text":"takes a little while to get seated.  Nice options on the menus. I opted for a bowl with soba noodles. I enjoyed and I enjoyed people watching lol."}
{"text":"Quinoa onion rings. Enough said.  But on a more formal note, this place serves up great vegetarian/vegan food. I was never into the whole vegetarian/vegan scene but one of my friends loves that stuff and she really wanted to show me this place so we decided to have dinner here.  The decor of this place is pretty standard and simple. Nothing to write home about but it was loud and packed with a lot of people! We had to wait in line for about 20-30 minutes for two people. They do have a take-out option as well, so if you're iffy about waiting but you still want to try their food, call ahead to place an order!  Onto their menu. It's quite extensive. With so many dishes to choose from, it's hard to decide right away what you want. They are also part juice bar, so they have an huge variety of the different types of smoothies and juices for you to choose from as well!  Right away, I knew what I was going to order. My friend has got me sold on this place when she told me that they had QUINOA ONION RINGS! What are these rings? Can I eat them? (Of course I can, I'm just exaggerating a little). I was so intrigued and curious as to how this dish would come out to be so I ordered a side of that. I had the option of ordering their dipping sauces so I chose garlic mayo. It was made out of vegan mayo so that'll be interesting.  I also got the the Powerhouse Fresh Bowl. You got to choose your carb, either rice or soba noodles. My friend said the soba noodles was much better than the rice so soba noodles it was!  Ordered. Chatted. Laughed. Bam. Our food came.  The Quinoa Onion Rings was something that I was not expecting. In my head I thought, was it going to be stuffed inside with quinoa and chopped onions?  I was wrong, it was just onion rings with a crispy golden quinoa batter. They were huge and fried (or baked?) perfectly. Crispy to the touch and absolutely delicious. You see, I'm a big fan of onion rings and these bad boys were perfect. The garlic mayo dip was so good! It was my first time having vegan mayo and it had the consistency and the taste of sour cream. It was strangely addicting.  Now onto the mains, my friend's BBQ burger looked delicious. I thought it only came with one piece of quinoa onion ring on top but it came with three! So if you're thinking of trying the quinoa onion rings and don't want to order a side order of it on it's own, the BBQ burger is a great choice for first time Fresh eaters!  My fresh bowl looked like a bowl of rabbit food. Good rabbit food in fact. Deep down I'm a meat lover but this bowl of food satisfied the hell out of me. It came with two pieces of tofu steak and it was my first time ever eating this. Took my first bite and it tasted like a piece of cooked meat. The marinade for these tofu steaks was on point and it was cooked perfectly. Choosing the soba noodles was a good idea because it really tied the whole dish together perfectly. It was refreshing to have soba noodles instead of rice because it was something a little bit different than the usual (being Chinese, we eat rice like every single day). Bonus because the chewy consistency of the noodles paired up well with the crunch of the veggies.  Overall, it was a great dining experience. Really packed and small. Seemed to always be busy and line-ups are inevitable but it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"A bunch of my friends are vegetarians, and whenever they come into town, we go to Fresh.  There's 3 different Fresh restaurants, and they're pretty much the same wherever you go.  Being an omnivore, I don't really go out of my way to go to Fresh all the time, but it is on my list of restaurants I like to go there every once and a while.  Reason why?  Sweet potato fries.  They are AMAZING.  I think it's mostly because they bake their fries which makes them pretty good.  Add in some miso gravy and you got the best thing that's ever been in your mouth in the potato french fry family.  So word to the wise, they do have vegan stuff on the menu, but definitely nothing meat oriented.  Personally I don't really mind, but one thing that I don't like at all are the baked goods here.  I tried the cornbread once and... gah...  The cornbread here is definitely not very good.  Also, the cakes are a little bit dry because they don't put any butter and or eggs in it.    A bunch of the years ago Fresh had a vegan cheesecake that was actually exceptional.... well, for having no cheese in it.  However, Fresh got rid of the cheesecake because they said that it didn't last very long.  Pity, I wish they still had this around.  The thing I usually get when I come here are the bowls.  Most of the time I get the macro greens.  I've had other bowls, but I kinda like this one the best.  Mostly because I can put whatever dressing I want depending on how I've feeling that day.  The other thing that I always get whenever I'm here is the marinated grilled tofu steaks.  I find them a nice contrast to the vegetables as they are a little more solid than the vegetables.  Fresh allows you to mix and match as well incase you want to \"create your own bowl\" as well as substitute your rice for soba noodles.  Personally I never usually get the soba noodles because it doesn't really remind me of soba noodles (Guess that's just me).  Another thing is that they have daily soups that they keep changing up.  I've had times where they had some pretty fantasmic soups, so if you land on a good day and the soup is to your liking you may luck out.  Fresh is one of those places that's good for everyone.  If you haven't tried vegetarian food then this is probably the best place to lure you in.  Hey, even if you have it's definitely a good place to have a good time."}
{"text":"I'm just a sucker for Fresh and all their locations, but since moving to the east end this has been my go-to location for bowls and burritos!  I'm lazy and seldom cook, so I'm always looking for healthy takeout options and this is one of the best in the city. I am always craving their Energy Bowl and it's hard to resist grabbing one on my way home from a long day at work. I also love their Black Bean Burrito for a more portable, hands-on option.  Like most of the other locations this Fresh is tiny -- you're lucky to find a seat when things get busy (which is always). Even when grabbing something to go it's hard to find a place to post up for 15 minutes without being in the thick of traffic.  The food is amazing, and you'll likely be more-than-satisfied with any of their menu options. I love Fresh and would eat it every day -- but it's expensive. Like really expensive. If you want a large bowl with noodles you're looking at 20 bucks. Is it worth it? I would say \"yes\" but one day I will purchase one of their cookbooks and learn to make the Energy Bowl at home!"}
{"text":"Fresh is the best place to go when you are craving for a delicious and healthy meal.   Ok, not everything they have is super healthy but even the onion rings are battered with quinoa!  Their large menu has something that satisfies everyone and it always takes me forever to choose something from their awesome juice/smoothie bar to go with my meal.   If there is one near my work, it would definitely be a regular lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after a Yoga workout.  It was 8:30pm on a weekday and the place was packed!  Usually a good sign.  The seats are really tight, but it must be because it's such a happening place.    I'm not a vegan, or even a vegetarian but was willing to give this place a try.  I was actually really surprised at how many dishes that I was interested in trying.    I got the beach bowl with soba noodles and goat cheese (I needed my cheese!  and was happy that they had a little bit for us dairy eaters).  It was absolutely delicious and filling.  I actually had to take some home.  I also took home a cashew cookie which was fresh baked and a great treat for my sweet tooth.  I also ordered a side of cornbread.  I LOVE cornbread and theirs did not disappoint at all.    My friend got the soup, salad and cornbread combo.  She made a mistake when ordering because she thought she could pick any salad and so she ordered the ironman.  When the order came we realized that there was an extra meal.  We explained the misunderstanding no questions asked, the waitress took it back and never charged her.  Great customer service.    Although I love my meat and cheese, I will come back here for a nice healthy meal!"}
{"text":"Got a baby size soba noodle powerhouse. It had avocado, chick peas & grilled tofu steaks and a bunch of nuts. It tasted and looked very healthy. I found the bowl a little too spicy for me. Baby size is more than enough for the average person. Great restaurant and vibe!"}
{"text":"Went to Fresh on a Thursday evening.The place was busy but luckily no lineup  . W e were seated right away.  This was our third evperience at the restaurant and it does not dissapoint.  The choices are delicious.  The food is fresh and healthy with generous portions. We always feel satisfied but not uncomfortably full.  My partner had the powerhouse bowl and I ordered a super salad. We shared a half liter of organic wine. Bill total $63 for both.  Quality of the food is very good."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Dine in service is quite good, long waits. For take out they are particularly slow with attitude. Like with the soup Nazi, quality of the food has me coming back."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian food, we usually get take out and almost always order the quinoa onion rings (with chipotle mayo), buddha bowl and all star salad.  Portions size is great and there's usually enough leftover for another meal!"}
{"text":"The buffalo wrap was delicious and felt like real chicken, and the bowls are really good too."}
{"text":"As a former vegan, I frequented this place ALOT. The food has always been amazing and the service excellent. I cannot recall ever having a bad or inconsistent experience.   I have pretty much had everything on the menu and everything is really good. The squash tacos and the Gojiccino are my faves!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch after a recommendation from one of the helpful employees at AGO. So glad we did! Our waitress was incredibly helpful and gave us wonderful recommendations. When I asked her \"what's good?\" She pointed out all the popular and especially yummy items in each section of their vast and overwhelming menu.   We shared a turmeric gold (which they nicely split into two cups for us) and had the poutine as a starter. Both were fantastic. The poutine was made even better by their house hot sauce. I had the BBQ burger and my husband had the Jerusalem bowl with falafel. The burger was flavorful and delicious. I loved the quinoa onion rings that came on it. And my husband, who is extremely picky about his falafel, was singing their praises over his meal. Not to mention they are super prompt at refilling the water bottle at the table and providing extra napkins when you've destroyed the first ones. Loved it and wish we had it back home!"}
{"text":"FULL DISCLAIMER:  I'm a vegetarian!!  I love vegetarian food!  But as you know, some full on vegan/vegetarian restaurants really disappoint me.  Not Fresh!  Fresh was one of the first places I tried in Toronto YEARS ago when I came to visit.  Back on that trip, I was having intense problems with gall stones and stomach aches and wasn't able to enjoy my meal here.  So, on my last night in Toronto, my dad and I decided to celebrate by going and trying it again.  Man this place gets packed!  The tables are so tiny.  You really feel like you're eating on top of your neighbor.  Definitely not a place to have a private conversation.  Servers look as if they are straight out of an American Apparel ad.  Very attractive, hipster type women.  This time around, the food was delish.  Here is what we ordered.  HOT COCO WITH ALMOND MILK.  Yummy.  Let mine cool so it was just warm.  Dad and I shared it as our \"desert\" before the meal.  FULL ORDER OF FRENCH FRIES:  -1 star for the fact french fries do not come with a burger!  But these fries are great.  Really tasty and a nice treat.  We got ours with some kind of vegan garlic aioli which may be some of the best veganase I have ever had?  It was great.  ONION RINGS - In my mind, these are Fresh's trade mark item.  Their quinoa onion rings are fun, crunchy, and tasty ... albeit a bit greasy sometimes.  LENTIL SOUP:  Cup/bowls of soup are pretty big.  My dad got some lentil soup and thought it was really tasty on a cool day to warm him up.  MUSHROOM BURGER:  For some reason I decided to get the mushroom burger without the mushrooms, even though I love mushrooms.  I just think I wasn't feeling it that day.  I remember vaguely no substitutions which is okay I guess, but whatevs!  Upon putting my burger together it was really messy although tasty.  One of the better veggie burger patties I have had.  BBQ BURGER:  My dad wanted a burger as well (celebration burgers anyone?) so he got the bbq burger, which was even MESSIER than mine.  But he managed to finish it!  Both burgers came with a salad which I actually really enjoyed.  All in all, I liked my second go at Fresh.  When back in Toronto, I will definitely swing by Fresh for some great vegan food!"}
{"text":"I like the space, food and drinks. I ordered the quinoa onion rings and the bbq burger. The onion are so good! The burger is pretty dry so not the best veggie burger I've had but I still like the flavor."}
{"text":"Nut shell fragments in my salad almost caused serious dental problems. We are not talking about large, obvious pistachio shells. We're talking about small, non-obvious fragments of nut shells that get unsuspectingly chewed on.  Would not come here again. I can't inspect every single bite before I eat it. Eating is a major hassle if I have to do that. It's also not fun to break your molars or have shells cutting into your gums as you're eating their salad."}
{"text":"This is my favourite vegetarian restaurant. I have been vegetarian for over a couple decades and like a mix of healthy and comfort food. There are some locations that are better than others and I would say the Queen and Crawford outshines the rest overall. Some days I really crave healthy rice/salad bowls but others I want a good veggie burger and sweet potato fries. The smoothies and juices are great as well. Often they are busy so you may have to wait for a table at prime meal times. My only criticism for them or any restaurant is don't put the music too loud because if it's not enjoyed by customer it can change the experience of the whole meal."}
{"text":"My friends and I went out last night and we were thinking of the following: \"what's a place that's cheap, healthy AND delicious?\"  We somehow ended up at \"fresh\" and that's exactly what it was.  We got seated in about 15 minutes considering that it was quite packed around 7:00 PM.  My friends and I all ordered the prix-fixe menu.  $21 for four items: smoothie/juice, starter, entree, and dessert.  Not only that, we decided to share the sweet potato fries.  It was absolutely delicious.  1) SWEET POTATO FRIES: we ordered this with the the avocado chipotle dip.  Now I understand why people order the sweet potato fries - it was amazing!  2) ANTIOXIDANT SMOOTHIE: With pomegrantate, blueberry and banana.  It was really good and very refreshing (and knowing that it's full of antioxidants, it made it a lot better)!  3) AVOCADO WHITE BEAN DOSAS:  These were really good as well.  Basically a pancake with white beans and avocado in it.  Had a little kick to it - I really liked it as a starter.. but this is when I started to get full.  4) ENERGY BOWL w/ SOBA NOODLES: Contains: marinated tofu cubes, rich coconut curry sauce, chick pea & vegetable stew, cucumber, tomato, red onion, sunflower sprouts & tahini sauce.  The problem about eating all these starters and a smoothie - we couldn't even take more than 10 bites into the bowl.  It was good, but considering I was *that* full - I couldn't even enjoy it.  5) FLOURLESS CASHEW COOKIE: I took this to go and it was quite oily (through my bag); it tasted a lot like a peanut butter cookie, but I only took one bite.  Overall, great food, great service (was able to split our bills!).  However, I've learned that if I get this prix-fixe menu next time, I'm splitting it between a friend and I."}
{"text":"One of my favourite vegan restaurants! While the menu is intimidating as all the options are loaded with plants you've never heard of much less ate, everything I've tried so far is yummy and on par with non-vegan food. This particular visit, I got a mushroom onion burger ($12) with added protein (\"crispy chick'n tenders\", $2.50) and a side of fries ($3). I think every burger/wrap/taco plate comes with a little kale salad, as well. The burger had great flavour, was stacked with plenty of mushrooms, and the patty had a nice taste. It's not one of those patties that tries to imitate meat flavours but it is good in its own way. I believe they use almond grain patties (or something like that). I was a little disappointed in the crispy chick'n tenders. I thought they would be an added protein in the burger but they came in a little side bowl and ended up being two measly lil vegan chicken nuggets. Not worth the added price. The fries were good but nothing special and the kale salad is just like any kale salad. Service is great, everyone is super friendly. The place is a bit on the small side but they have a nice outdoor seating area for warmer days. The food took a little bit long to make but the taste makes it worth it. I haven't tried any of their drinks, but I know a lot of people are a big fan of their smoothies and pressed juices. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Its good people!!! It actually deserves more than 5 stars if I could give them =)  I stopped by here to grab lunch on an afternoon I forgot to pack mine from home. Being Vegetarian, its not too hard for me to find food at regular restaurants in the city, however, I really wanted to see what this place was about.  I ordered the baby version of the Dragon bowl on brown basmati rice. It contained grilled zucchini, marinated and grilled tofu steaks, herbed and grilled tomatoes. Not too exciting ..but then came the best part - the miso curry sauce. I could dip everything in it and eat it up ITS DELICIOUS! Once you mix it all up, the flavors really come together and you can hear them singing in harmony you mouth - ok its a bit of a stretch but any foodie knows what I mean.  I found out later on from co worker that fries dipped in that sauce taste beyond good ( I dont' doubt it) and I will be trying that out next.  I'm so glad I found this place !"}
{"text":"I went for a quick bite during tiff. I was seated and served quickly. I had the poutine with mushroom gravy and vegan cheese sauce made from potatoes, carrots and nutritional yeast. It was so satisfying. I grabbed a fresh pressed juice to go, which was expensive but delicious."}
{"text":"When veg food is this good everyone will enjoy...  We are not vegan or even vegetarian but we love to check out this type of restaurant and Fresh on Spadina did not disappoint. The place was hopping at about 1:30 pm when we arrived and there was a bit of a wait. Everyone sat cheek by jowl but they were in a good mood so the vibe was positive.  We had the onion rings which are best we have ever had anywhere. We had a Breathless Smoothie and a Multivitamin juice blend with lots of ginger. We got the bread/olives/duk which has a dipping oil and is very filling. We had a superfood small bowl and a Baby Enery Bowl and for the \"small\" size they were quite large. Our total came to $54 CAN before tip.  This place gets consistently high ratings and I can see why."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Fresh on Spadina for over a year now; unfortunately, out of convenience.   I will not be back because of a few reasons:  1. The service is not good. The staff seem to have an attitude  - I know it's a tuff industry, but you would expect a 'fresh' experience when you're there, especially due to the price you pay. In fact, after ordering takeout salads for a year, I went to sit down on the outside patio and was swept off by a server who said they could only do full service. She didn't ask if i wanted to order a drink or anything more, just a back-handed go. Not good, especially when their were plenty of seats available. What's with that?  2. The prices are not reasonable. You can go to Fresh 11 across the street and get a better salad, more filling and for less. E.g: the salmon salad. No, I do not work for them and am not in the restaurant industry.  3. Wait times. Wait times can be very bad if you are in a rush for lunch, or want a quick bite before a movie or drinks with friends. Depending on the time of day, expect long delays. It can also be very loud - not exactly a great place for a date.   Overall, the food isn't bad, but the service is horrible. WIth a few adjustments, I'm hoping Fresh can recover. I think it would take one other solid sit-down type vegetarian restaurant with good service to really impact Fresh's service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a colleague and I loved it! Really crisp vegetables and great flavors. I ordered:  -Powerhouse Bowl, Baby size on rize -16oz Green Detox smoothie with  vega protein  The Powerhouse bowl was so delicious, and the hot sauce they gave me on the side was AMAZING. I want to buy it and bring it home, it's like a spicy peanut sauce. I couldn't finish the bowl even though it was baby size--so beware! It's a lot of food, I can't imagine getting the full size. I thought it would be smaller so that's why I got a smoothie to go with it.  The smoothie wasn't very good with the protein in it, the balance was off. It really tasted like protein and was too sweet.   I will be back for another Bowl soon!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for the sole purpose of trying one of their cold-pressed juices!  Not gonna lie...I was totally attracted by the pretty glass bottle and lovely typography on the label but I am also a big cold-pressed drinker so it was the best of both worlds.  I dropped in on a Saturday morning so the fridge was fully stocked with fresh juice and I ended up picking the Vitamin C. I'm a huge cayenne and ginger fan (I usually pick juices with ginger on purpose) but I was surprised at how strong this juice was for me! The spice was a heavy burn in the back of my throat and I actually couldn't get through more than a 1/3 of my juice before I had to call it quits. I totally dig freshness and the thermogenic qualities of ginger and cayenne but this was too much and such a shame too because it ran me $11."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots until I overindulged in their Superfood salad (don't get the Large - it's actually gigantic! I learned that day that it was actually possible to get bloated off a salad).  Fresh proves that vegan doesn't mean leaving the restaurant hungry. They do a really nice burger (I saw Nick Jonas here once, eating a burger. No joke.). Their noodle bowls are to die for, and they have a nice variety of sauces so you can always switch up the flavor.  And their Panko onion rings are just famous. And the soup + salad combo is also a favorite, and comes with a delicious side of cornbread.  Ambiance is casual, and they got a really great storefront patio for people-watching on a sunny Sunday in summer.  Some come by and give it a try! Vegan food tastes great, and feels good for the soul."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good, fresh and well prepared.  The staff was nice and prompt.  Even though they were very busy.  It pays to call ahead if you want a carry out. Loved everything."}
{"text":"The food and service here are always good but the space is a very intimate squeeze. Don't come unless you are OK with that - they do their best to accommodate everyone. If you feel slightly squished it would be better to grab and go!  Overall my favorite dish is the falafel tacos. They are amazing."}
{"text":"It's a little magical how food that seems to use such basic ingredients and little to no sauces and dressings can taste so amazing. For example, I got the \"Beach\" bowl, which has grilled red pepper, zucchini & sweet potato with avocado, and a whole lot more. The taste that makes a zucchini a zucchini is amplified by 100 times the taste you are used to. It's just an explosion of flavour in every bite. Healthy food has never tasted so good!  It is easy to overlook the fact that a lot of the bowls come in \"baby\" portions and are about $3-4 cheaper. Given how full I was from the full sized portion on soba noodles, I'd probably drop down to the baby portion next time.  The prices are reasonable as well, but I found the atmosphere average. It was a cold September evening, but it was uncomfortably warm inside. If you have a vegetarian or health freak visiting you though, this is where you should take them, it will be heaven for them."}
{"text":"This place was close to where I was staying in Toronto and as I'm a vegetarian, it seemed like the perfect place to go for dinner. I called in my order ahead at 7:30pm, to be ready by 8pm. I ordered the macro greens with veggies only ($10) and added grilled tempeh (+$2) to my order. This bowl comes with one sauce, so I ordered the one that the person on the phone recommended, which was the peanut lime.   The macro greens came with steamed kale, broccoli, bean sprouts and and grilled sweet potato. There were two extra tempeh steaks in the box. I enjoyed the dinner overall, especially with the peanut lime sauce. However, I don't think it was quite worth the price, since if I had bought those ingredients and steamed them at home, it probably would have come out to less than $5. I would recommend this place if you're too lazy to cook dinner but also want something healthy and fairly delicious.   At the restaurant, I couldn't help but order their vegan chocolate chip cookie, which was made of ingredients such as vegan chocolate chips, soy milk, coconut oil and other healthy and delicious ingredients. It was only $2 and definitely worth it! It tasted just like a regular cookie (maybe better!). I'll definitely come back to try more of their desserts in the future! I also really want to try their vegan burgers which sound delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh lives up to its hype of making vegetarianism/veganism trendy. The menu list is huge - there are drinks, smoothies, noodles, appetizers, burgers, etc. I'm not a vegetarian but any I come here, I'm always indecisive because I want to try everything!   FOOD: The immune-fighting drinks and smoothies are really flavourful, they taste like something you might have whipped up in your kitchen minutes earlier. I've found that many of their main courses are also quite tasty, the chefs have done a really good job at taking classic meals and turning them into an enjoyable healthy vegetarian/vegan option. My personal favourite is the Tangled Thai salad as the portion size is very generous and it's incredibly savoury and fresh. I'd also recommend the sweet potato fries if you are looking for an appetizer to share with the hesitant first-timer.   AMBIENCE/SERVICE: Overall, the restaurant has a trendy and busy atmosphere. The crowd is young, energetic, and the staff are all very pleasant and helpful. I've gone with a friend who has a million allergies, and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the contents about each dish.  PRICES: reasonable for the quantity and quality of food you receive.   CONS: My only complaint is that on weekend evenings, it can get extremely crowded and it slightly feels like you're sitting on top of the people next to you. Other than that, if you're looking for a diverse vegetarian menu and a hip experience in the city, Fresh is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is not just a \"good for a meatless place\" place. I am a carnivore and this place is fantastic. I even eat their \"burgers' which are delicious.   Great bowls, wraps, onion rings are great. Go here. Anyone who says it sucks has terrible taste in food."}
{"text":"I am a meat lover.  A classic hamburger is my all time fav.  So when my friend took me to this vegan restaurant I was skeptical.  I ordered the \"banquet burger\" with bean sprouts and veggie bacon.  And it was so good and super filling.  Usually I still have room after eating a hamburger but after eating the veggie burger I was so full.  If you're like me and love burgers gives this vegan place a try.  Tastes amazing, great service and a bonus that it fills you up!  If I am in the area, I will go again!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the fuss over Fresh is all about. We walked in and were squeeeeezed into our seats. I was practically hitting elbows with the strangers in other tables sitting to my left and right. It was very uncomfortable.   The food is blah as well. It's not as \"healthy\" as you think, once you factor in the overwhelming amount of sauce and oil that is used.   Boyfriend ordered the Thai curry (Buddha) bowl. I ordered a the phytosalad. I probably preferred the salad to the curry bowl. They were both ok. I would not come again. If you want to eat healthy and fresh, go to Live Organic Food Bar instead."}
{"text":"Since writing this review this has becoming part of my stomping ground.  As of July 1st they've changed their daily specials (they went thru a few changes) and now between 3 and 6 you can pick up a $6 entree for dine-in or take-out.    Spend $6 for a healthy, unprocessed (helloooo Mr. Sub) meal?  Hells YEAH!  I grab one of these on my way to my office when I see evening clients."}
{"text":"It's always a struggle to get good tasting vegetarian food - it's like people think if it's vegan, it has to be bland and boring. But this is not what you get at Fresh. When I had the menu in front of me, I was overwhelmed with choice. Normally there is only one thing I can eat on the menu (if that), but here I can eat everything!    Though I have an obsession with miso gravy, I went for banana nut pancakes with tofu scramble and vegan sauasage patties. Oh my god.  Those pancakes were amazing.  I've never actually eaten pancakes that good, ever in my life. It sounds dramatic but it's true.  And this would be good for the veggies and non-veggies alike. I wish I lived in Toronto so I could go there everyday.  To whomever owns Fresh, can you please open one in England for me please?"}
{"text":"I recently had the Ace of Kale salad from Fresh. I did not eat there, therefore I will only be commenting on the food, not the service or the restaurant itself.   The kale salad was absolutely delicious. I LOVE the hot chilli sauce from Fresh and hot mustard. I used those as dressing. The bacon tempeh adds a little something different to the salad, as well as delicious proteins.  I will be back !"}
{"text":"Great veg spot that one of my local friends told me about. So many amazing options to choose from. I loved their ginger ale made from scratch. It was refreshing. I really like the buffalo cauliflower wings and dragon fries. The only thing was I felt rushed eating there and didn't know why since there was no one waiting for a table."}
{"text":"One thing I love about veggie eating is the sharpness of the herbs and spices....the meat taste and texture doesn't overwhelm them.  Went there with a collegue and his burger was just that. Very yummy.  I had the budda w/ soba, but this wasn't so much that way.  The satay was thick and not a lot of tofu.....so this one I wouldn't suggest. The ginger ale was really refreshing, certainly not Canada Dry!!!! Overall, it was good.  I need to try some more dishes before I give it a must have!"}
{"text":"Fresh is a really great name for this place!   And it's everything all Yelpers have previously noted: Fresh, minimally processed, healthy, vegan, etc, etc If you're ordering any apps at all, only order the baby size bowls/salads, it's a lot of food! Loved the poutine!  So little chance to have it if you're a vegan!  We ordered the green goddess, dragon and Buddha bowls, all with soba.  I would recommend the rice actually.  The tahini sauce on the soba is a little heavy, weighs them down.     Staff is so sweet and efficient."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)  I have eaten at Fresh countless times but don't have super-strong feelings about it, so it has taken me this long to write a review. I started to think about this place... I have come here in a large group, on dates, with 'the girls', with my grandma, and alone. How many restaurants can I say that about? So, I gotta give Fresh props for always being there and being fairly reliable when you're in the mood for something nutritious and delicious.   I find the food at this location better than at the Bloor location.   I have tried almost all the bowls. My favourite is the baby energy bowl with soba noodles. I find the 'baby' portion filling enough for me (also, I don't understand why only selected bowls come in the baby size...). The curry coconut sauce is really yummy! The magic tofu wrap is another hit in my books. If you are really hungry, they usually have some kind of prix fixe and they also participate in Veggielicious. Smoothies are expensive, but BIG. Several serving of fruit right there. The dessert offerings are less exciting -- mostly vegan cookies that are kind of greasy. I like how they bring you a big jug of water without you having to ask.   They are very accommodating of dietary restrictions. Brought my friend with Celiac disease here and they gave her a separate menu clearly indicating gluten-free items on the menu and which dishes could be modified to be gluten-free.   This place gets packed on Friday nights and during weekday lunch hour but otherwise, you can usually get a table without waiting (Bloor St. one seems more busy). The small patio on Spadina is nice."}
{"text":"Recommend everything. I've never been disappointed. Always full when I leave :) I've brought people from out of town and they always find something on the menu. Great for lunch, the soup & salad & cornbread combo if you can't decide."}
{"text":"There are some mixed reviews here about Fresh and from a food creativity standpoint I can appreciate that on some of the menu items. However, you're getting what you came for and that's what matters to me.   A mainstay for meal options when I'm traveling, Fresh has fresh bowls, juices and more. Yes it might just be rice and steamed greens but their sauces enhance everything.  When I come for healthy vegan food, that's all I really want. I don't care for the vegetables to be made into unrecognizable too small, creative portions. With that being said, Fresh still has some interesting spins on their menus, most notably the quinoa onion rings which are out of this world! And their homemade hot sauce is equally as good (I finish half the jar with every meal). I just wish there was somewhere like this in Calgary."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I see eye to eye on many things but when it comes to Fresh, Toronto's vegan go to, we always disagree.  Don't get me wrong, I love vegetarian food; I have to, I only eat fish but there is something not good about the place.  First of all, it's expensive, especially when one is aware of how much a bloody can of chickpeas costs them to throw inside a stale wrap.  Secondly, they don't do substitutions.  How bloody difficult is it to exchange tempeh with tofu or pumpkin seeds with sunflower, especially when the item is already way overpriced.  Isn't the vegetarian mentality to love animals and eachother? Or is the hippy kitchen staff too stoned to handle a distinction like that?  Thirdly, the food is simply underwhelming - it's the kind of food a meat-eater would expect vegetarian food to taste like, thereby giving us meat-urge-suppressers a bad rap.    The only thing Fresh truly has to offer is the coolness factor.  Unlike the majority of the Veggie restaurants in Toronto, Fresh actually has taken time to make its décor fun and well I guess Fresh.  Maybe it was the design the owner was referring to when he gave his restaurant this undeserving moniker; there's no way he could be talking about the food."}
{"text":"I'd give Fresh 5 stars on food but only 4 on service. Line ups can be long, seating limited, and wait times for food too long but that's because they're always really busy.  As a vegetarian, it doesn't get better than this for options. A plethora of really good tasting dishes - rice and noodle based or the best salads around, wraps, appetizers - and don't forget the juice bar! All made Fresh to order :-) It isn't vegan though and there are lots of nuts to those with severe allergies will have to be careful.   My get take out from here at least once a week and am never disappointed with my order. My favourites include the Mega Life salad - but get the crispy tofu cubes instead of the marinated ones (that goes for any dish!) with peanut lime dressing or the Tangled Thai salad - or the Holiday Wrap - or the Warrior - heck you can't go wrong here, it's all good.  They have a good priced 4 course (juice being the 4th) prix fix which I think is perfect if you're going for dinner.   Tip: If you're going to get take out, call ahead so you don't sit there for 15 minutes waiting."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian BUT this place has quickly become my new favourite dinner place. I am making my way through the menu and so far have found nothing below 5 stars. It is taking me a while to try everything since I frequently get stuck on one delicious thing and have to order is a few times before I move on the the next, but I have high hopes that the 5 star quality will continue until I reach the end.  If you have not yet tried this place out, you must."}
{"text":"I got the burger with Chipotle and \"bacon\"  it should have been delicious. The burger was tall and thick and difficult to eat. There was a strong after taste of thyme that over powered the burger. There was not enough Chipotle sauce for it to be tasted bc the sauce itself was really light. The fries were good though. The kaleslaw was definitely interesting, and not in a bad way.   The concept is great but over priced and not executed well."}
{"text":"Wow, I am surprised with the previous reviews. I love this place!   I am not a vegetarian, but I enjoy foods of all kinds and came here at the suggestion of a friend.   The downfall here is the lack of seating, cramped tables and boy, does it ever get noisy.   But, all that aside - I love dining at Fresh. I always go for some kind of bowl with soba noodles and water, so I can't speak much on the burgers and drinks. The bowls are great though - lots of veggies, huge servings and really cool combinations of flavours I would never even think of. I always have leftovers. Oh - another downfall: the leftover boxes are made of some kind of earth-friendly material. I do appreciate the effort, but sometimes by the time I get home, the box has gotten all soggy and started breaking down.   I keep meaning to try a smoothie with my meal, but I just feel it would be too filling. I do feel super healthy after eating here. I vow to never read the calorie content/nutrition info, at risk of ruining that feeling.  I hear the sweet potato fries are awesome."}
{"text":"Was little disappointed with the salad I ordered. Seemed too expensive for what I got. Very simple, basic and I did not like the taste. The tofu was the worst part. I just wish they had something more \"wow\" like Kupfert & Kim, for example. My husband also ordered lunch from there and he did not like it. Also the customer service was not the friendliest. I was standing in line to ask about the soup of the day, and the woman behind the register looked at me with annoyed look and said \"look there on the board! It's all written there!\" Oh, ok. You could be nice at least. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I was not happy at all with my experience here. We didn't have to wait for a table and got seated right away. The store looked really busy. I ordered poutine and salad. Both of the were awful and the fries was cold. The salad had no flavouring nor seasoning. It was honestly horrible. I would have done a better job doing a salad. The fries for the poutine was cold but the sauce was lukewarm. I genuinely did not like the food but thats not a major issue. I've been there before and I would've just let it pass. Every restaurant had bad day. I've been here twice and their food last time was good. The waiters seemed really uninterested and only came by once to change our water.   Here is where my frustration is. The bill costed me 19.78 and I give a 20 dollar bill. She asked me change and I said no. It makes no sense getting change for few cents. She then looks at me and asks me that she wants tip. I was speechless not because of the tip but because she was very rude. My friends are there too and they were also asked for tip. I asked her to repeat herself since she was talking but it was a bit noisy and I couldn't hear her. I only heard 'tip.' and she said that there was a 15% tip requirement. I then ask her how much 15% would be. Mind you, I've tipped waiters before but never have been treated like this and its not like I was going to pop open my phone to calculate the 15% of my bill for start tipping her. She tells me that its 3-4 dollars and that they tip their waiters at the end of the day. She also mentioned how my tip was going to be going to ALL the waiters. I told her that I find that a bit weird because she was the one who served me and only changed my water ONCE. The tip wasn't even going to the chefs. Which again, the food was bad. I don't want people to assume that I'm cheap or unwilling to pay a few dollars extra. I'm sure everyone can pay 3-4 dollars but it was her attitude that really put me down. Honestly, I would have left the bad food get away. Some days are busy and food can be a bit bad than other days but if the waiter is mean and rude to you then that just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I did tip her at the end of the day. Few bucks was really not the issue. It was how badly I was treated that day.   I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Vegan/Vegetarian options in Toronto because the menu is much more extensive than other places and the quality of the food is relatively consistent. I find that service is generally quite good too, although you might end up waiting in line for 20 minutes or so during peak hours. I don't like the seating here because it's too cramped and hard. The tables are so close together that sometimes I have no choice but to listen to the conversations around me.  Check out the daily specials for good deals. It's a great opportunity to try something healthy for half the cost of regular items. The desserts are all delicious and I highly recommend the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"I need meat.  Unless I have meat, I'm hungry.  This is what I've always found, and this is what I've always believed.  Then I went to Fresh.  Had a bowl of lentil soup and one of their super-protein salads.  I was full, happy, and amazed.  With the house sesame dressing, and all those oh-so-good-for-ya nuts and seeds and roots and bark thingies...I was satisfied for the night.  Great flavours.  And I joke about the roots and bark.  This is a great place to go for detox and penance.  Downside?  Too loud for my tender little ears."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with a friend. First time diner and generally a meat lover. There was so much variety and filling non-meat options.  We shared a small sweet potato fries and I had the Beach bowl on soba noodles which was very tasty and extremely filling. My friend has the felafel salad bowl which looked tasty. All of the veg came out whole and in large chunks which was good, but I personally prefer it chopped so I can get into the eating - love having a bit of everything in each bite!"}
{"text":"This is the first time for me to eat a Vegetarian meal, so please note that the review is based from a meat-eater perspective. The restaurant is quite small so remember to make a reservation, as the wait can be 15-30 minutes.  *Drinks:  -Sweet Ginger Tea with green tea, raw ginger and maple syrup - $5: I don't like ginger so I didn't taste this, but my friend enjoyed it and she had a sore throat coming, so this helped to calm her throat :).  -gojiccino -$5: a cappuccino-style beverage made from pure goji berries. I LOVE this drink. Surprisingly it doesn't taste fruity. The taste is very unique: naturally sweet, taste like a mocha but with a herbal finish.   *Food:  -poutine -$8: The portion was huge! I enjoyed this dish but unfortunately I couldn't taste the cheese. For me the cheese curds are a big part of poutine, but again this is a pure vegetarian poutine, so I can look past that. The fries were thick and I believe they were baked, but I wished they were a bit more crispy though.The gravy is made from smoked mushrooms and it was not too heavy, quite light and very smooth.  -bbq burger - $12:  The onion rings were well cut, not like the skinny pitiful stringy type of onion rings. They were coated with puffed quinoa batter and fried (or baked?), really crispy and delicious! I didn't get to try the burger but my friend loved it.  -Buddha Fresh Bowl - baby size with soba noodle - $11.50: quite disappointed with this dish. Luckily I chose the baby size too, as the normal size would have costed me $17. The tofu steaks tasted like cooked meat. The marinade for this dish was on point and it was cooked to perfection. The peanut sauce overpowers the ingredients and made the dish really heavy. I suppose the fresh vegetables (tomato, cucumber, bean sprouts) were supposed to cut down the heaviness of the dish, but it did little to nothing. My friend tried it and she agreed that the dish was really heavy as well. Furthermore, the soba noodles were overcooked and turned soggy. In my opinion, the soba noodles should be cooked, rinsed and served cold for this dish to work. Because the noodles were hot and sat at the bottom of the bowl, the noodles continued cooking, while soaking the peanut sauce, which made the noodles soggy. I ended up eating the tofu steaks and picked pieces of vegetables to eat lol.  Overall, while my experience wasn't good, I would come back and try other dishes. If you don't know what to order, I recommend ordering the burgers and quinoa onion rings. Although these are vegetarian dishes, they really fill you up and most dishes are tasty, while being nutritious :)."}
{"text":"A great vegan place in Toronto's Chinatown area. Very busy for dinner time. The outside patio seating and indoor seating had a very different atmosphere, the inside being dark and lit up by candles.   My friend and I both got vegan burgers. I tried the Banquet Burger with tempeh, vegan cheese, and alfalfa sprouts - when you order bunless, your burger is served on a large portion of mixed greens.  I highly recommend this place, if not just for the absolutely delicious vegan garlic mayo on this burger. So nice, I could have eaten it itself with a spoon. Only problem I find is that it's a little pricy, but kind of what you expect in this area of Toronto.  A great vegan place for when you've spent a weekend eating unhealthy stuff and want a bit of a detox."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey and lack lustre , would eat hear again but not the burrito and not the burgers"}
{"text":"I forgot my bankcard here and got it back!  Considering that I am an infamously famous canivore - the food is good here. It doesn't make me hate eating vegetarian. This being said, if I date a girl that is a vegetarian again - this is a winning solution!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience. Ordered the cauliflower buffalo wings, quinoa rings, and a burger and a salad and everything was awesome. The quality of the food was excellent. Also had a chocolate cake and carrot cake. And the service was excellent."}
{"text":"3.75 Stars. Came here 5 or more times during my stay in Toronto, and was definitely sick of it by the end of my time, but, that's to be expected!   I thought the food the whole experience was consistently 4 star quality, and no matter what I ate, I left feeling quite satisfied. You can't go wrong with Fresh, and this location is my favorite. Yes, there's almost always a wait, but it's never too long, and I find it worth it, as the vibe is bustling, but still cozy.   I recommend the soup of the day, the beach bowl with noodles, the jerusalem bowl with falafel and noodles, the buffalo \"chicken\" wrap when available, and the chocolate cake (divine). Oh, and, a hot deep chocolate (gotta ask for it hot). Also, I love the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place, I had heard the buzz and was meaning to try but never got around doing so.  As soon as I walked in I found it funny that you could see your stereotypical tree hugger - bohemian hispter - I dress in expensive bamboo cotton and tofu silks to purposely look like a troll types (ie. white ladies with dreads and strange clothing)  Took us a while to figure out what we wanted, apparently everything I pointed out to the waitress was her favourite dish. Finally settled on the beach bowl (without tofu) and enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything that stood out to me! It was just good, okay... you know?   The atmosphere and the juices and smoothies looked good, but I tried a mocha drink and it was way too sweet. I also had a tea with ginger and lemon - and it was just okay. I wasn't dazzled by this place."}
{"text":"The food here is really great! Not only do you not have to worry about there being dairy in your food but everything tastes so good! I had the falafel tacos and quinoa onion rings. Both were amazing! The tacos are super messy. They also have really good hot sauce. Once I got my food though, the service was pretty nonexistent. It also took them a long time to clear dishes and give me my bill. This place also gets pretty packed. They do have a patio to sit outside as well. I'll be back, and hopefully service will be better next time."}
{"text":"We are not vegetarians but try to eat more vegetarian than not for Heath. Anyway, we decided to hit up this place for lunch. Starving, we were met by less than friendly staff. The hospitality should have tipped us off for the rest of the meal. Bland.   My husband opted for a mushroom veg burger. The bun was good but he described cardboard as more tasty. I had a dragon with udon noodles. I rarely use salt but ended up having to use it 3x to give it any sort of flavor. The tofu steak in the bowl, however was delicious - hence the 2 stars rather than one.   Place seems to rely on trying to be hip than actually serving good food. Try elsewhere... We will. Clearly, they derive no pleasure from food at Fresh."}
{"text":"I've got to stop going here. I'm always disappointed. This time: The miso gravy served with he quinoa onion rings had a horrible glue like consistency. Almost a solid. Horrible. We told the sever when she asked how everything was and she offered to bring more, but we didn't want it because we had eaten most of the onions rings already. My friend was disappointed in her dish. I didn't enjoy the Tangled Thai salad. I tried this because they no longer serve the ace of kale salad. This one is meh. I had to ask for more dressing because it didn't seem like it had any. I don't even bother with the bowls anymore because they aren't as good as they used to be. Rice to topping ratio is off. That is all."}
{"text":"I love love love the food available here. This location always has a bit of a wait and the seating is a little cramped but it's definitely worth it (the Jerusalem bowl is a big hit in my house). Takeout is an easy grab but there isn't really anywhere to sit so I would recommend calling ahead to pick up or expect to constantly weave out of people's way as they're trying to get around you."}
{"text":"Bedded down in the nearby Hilton Garden Inn, and was hungry at odd hours - 3 pm in the afternoon.  Walked by and was just going to get fresh juice.  Ended up having soup and corncake.... It was great! The soup was wholesome and tasty, the corncake comes in large portion or tasting size.  Great! Soup changes everyday.  Love to go back to try other stuffs."}
{"text":"VIBE  As with all 3 Fresh locations: It's busy. It's trendy. It's crowded.  But service is on the ball. Evelyn is right: they're pretty good with their take-out (but I always call ahead).  I ATE Anything on the menu is good. I'm not a vegetarian, but I love how everything has tasted. On rotation: the breathless smoothie (strawberry, banana, mango); the soup, salad and cornbread combo is great value; the baby buddha rice bowl (OMG YUM); the big salad. The sweet potato fries are a hefty portion so caution if you're not sharing because you will fill up fast! The cookies are a nice treat at the end too.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Fresh lives up to its name. Great value. I actually now crave vegetables! (What is wrong with me is another conversation.)"}
{"text":"The entire Fresh chain is overhyped and overpriced. $10 for a smoothie to go is a bit much when Jugo Juice and Booster Juice have them for around $6.  I complained to the staff that my order didn't taste like it had any sauce, so she asked if I wanted more sauce. Obviously. Then later to my surprise I realize that she actually charged it to my bill! Ridiculous.  Also, apparently extra pita bread for the dip tray we ordered also warranted an extra $3 charge (could be more, I can't remember). I could definitely buy a whole bag for that much.  They nickel and dime you at Fresh and clearly do not comprehend customer service as the \"better\" restaurants do. Extra bread with your $15 dip tray order, extra sauce to make up for the fact there wasn't enough on it to begin with... all that stuff should be complimentary. I'm pretty sure it's up to the chef to make sure that the dip trays served have a good dip-to-pita ratio and when there's a discrepancy like this I've never been charged for more bread before, especially since it was one small pita bread cut up.  This place is overpriced and overhyped. They definitely know how to tap into the vegetarian/vegan market of people who don't realize that they can go to a BETTER restaurant and order a vegetarian option (or ask to have one made). Any respectable restaurant (of higher calibre than Fresh, that is) would accommodate vegetarians. You're better off going to a non-veggie restaurant and getting something made properly and served properly by proper kitchen and wait staff.  They don't take reservations either."}
{"text":"I want this place by my house! I want this food for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Kitchen straight out of heaven for Vegans and Vegetarians!!! You will also find Gluten Free options on the menu.   Food is designed in an interesting way, quite modern and exciting. Taste is fabulous, to the point it's easy to over eat. Everything tastes fresh, nothing is greasy or overly saucy. Clean and fresh!"}
{"text":"Call me crazy but when I see a place like this (one that I personally enjoy) with such mediocre reviews I wonder 'What's wrong with everyone?'. I have a policy at home that a restaurant with less than 4 stars should be bypassed or reserved for a day you wont be upset at a 'waste'. I take my food very seriously. So I ventured a little more in to the review section here to see what brought the marks down on this place, and here it is:  1) Price: Yes, it's expensive. Even I feel, at times, it's expensive to an unreasonable degree. It's casual atmosphere, service style, and location doesn't account for the price tag...but then I remember: This is alternative food. There are unique, healthy, exotic and unheard of, things on this menu. This cost money. Quality cost money. If you are a first timer to the health craze, 'detox' community the menu is confusing and unwarranted. Which brings me to my next point.   2) Intimidation: A ton of low marks came from sheer cluelessness. I won't berate the point, but this is obnoxious. I compare this to visiting a restaurant that serves offal and complaining about all the calf brains on the menu. Newbies, should take this restaurant as a learning experience and not a let down, that someone didn't just throw clique poutine on their plate.   3) Health Factor: A continuation of the above is the fact that people want poutine. 'These cheese curds didn't taste like cheese curds'. Well, of course they didn't. It's not cheese. Please oh please do not be surprised when things don't taste exactly as you want when this particular thing is not made with any of the same ingredients. If that is too harsh, don't eat here. These alternative foods are tasty, for what they are. The reviewers should know this, and review in context. I'll repeat: Burgers don't taste like burgers, and tacos don't taste like tacos. But Fresh's VERSION of these things is damn good. Please see: Quinoa Onion Rings.   4) Size and Service: It's beyond me how the same reviewers mentioned (too) large of portions and in the same breath the high price. Second with this complaint is service. A word to the wise, although prices are steep, this isn't fine dining. It's a cafe. Loud, bustling, and semi obnoxious. Know that.  All in all Fresh isn't the most amazing place I've ever been, but it's one of the best doing what they do. And within the context of it all, deserves a little more than three stars."}
{"text":"Staff are very rude! Absolutely hate the service here. Hire better people! Always welcome by sulky and gloomy staff. Workers are very very rude."}
{"text":"This location is accessible, the front door leads directly to Spadina Ave. There's paid parking in the area and a street car that runs on Spadina Ave and drops you off you close by. This is the first of three Fresh locations I've been too and the food is great. They have healthy and unhealthy vegetarian and vegan options and good portion sizes. I've tried the Buffalo Cauliflower, sweet potato fries, Quinoa Onion rings (fav), Happy Birthday Donut, and a burger. I recommend the chipotle mayo. All the sauces I've tried so far, though, have been great. There is patio in the front. Only complaint is the seating. The restaurant space is a bit tight, all the chairs and tables are pretty close. The booths are comfortable enough, the chairs less so."}
{"text":"Fresh serves the type of food I adore: nutritious, revitalizing and light.   Though Fresh is mainly a take-out restaurant, I would definitely recommend dining in and sitting at the patio. (U of T students get a 10% discount off takeout but make sure to bring your student ID!)   The menu was a bit overwhelming, mainly because everything looked so good.  I would highly recommend the Jerusalem bowl with flax hummus on soba noodles. Despite the hefty list of ingredients (at least twelve), everything complemented each other so well. The combination of tamari with hummus and lemony zest was absolutely divine. I have a love-hate relationship with soba noodles in Toronto, as most of the restaurants I have been to have totally butchered them. Thus, I am extremely happy to say that Fresh's soba noodles have my nod of approval. The noodles have great texture and are very tangy and well-chilled.   I would also recommend the  premium powerhouse bowl with avocado and mixed nuts, but make sure to tell them to put less tahini sauce in (if you are a spice light-weight like me) as the bowl is inordinately spicy.   Fresh trumps Freshii (ironically just located across the street) any day."}
{"text":"BBQ Burger was pretty good with a great combo of texture and flavour. Was disappointed when I got the bill and saw the quick-pick tip amounts here. Told the waitress I found it a little absurd given how high minimum wage is. Her response was a dismissive \"well that's standard\". 22% tip not standard anywhere in North America, nor are we in the US where min wage for servers is ~$3/hour."}
{"text":"Delivery never showed, no notification whatsoever. Was really looking forward to checking out this place but now very disappointed by their customer service. Won't recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"It's easy to fall in love with this place. I've eaten here quite a few times, and I'm sure that I'll be back. The food is hearty - meat eaters have nothing to fear from this place.  The price is not super cheap, but for the quality of food you get, I'm very happy with it. Service is casual and the setting is chill, so it's a comfortable environment all around."}
{"text":"Very vegetarian and vegan friendly.. Restaurant is a bit small though and you're literally sitting in between two different parties...service is very friendly though!  Had their sweet potato fries and they weren't crispy, which was great! Their quinoa crusted onion rings are amazing! I definitely recommend trying them! Also, tried their detox green drink and loved it! Ordered the Buddha Bowl per yelpers' suggestions and it was okay... There were loads of peanuts in it and the sauce tasted like straight up peanut butter, to the point where it made me feel like I was eating rice with peanut butter..."}
{"text":"I think everyone who believes vegetarian food is bland or boring should try the vegetarian restaurants at the corner of Richmond and Spadina.  You have 2 great choices, Fresh and Kupfret.  After trying both, I found they both have their strengths but I like Fresh on Spadina more.  I found the flavours and dishes better even if the aesthetics and atmosphere was worse.   Fresh on Spadina is different from Kupfret (K&K).  Fresh on Spadina is a sit down restaurant and K&K is fast casual.   K&K has an instagram vibe and pic friendly space with lots of lights.  Fresh is cute with its chandelier but its crammed and dark away from the front window.  K&K menu is more raw focused and Fresh has a giant menu that covers your raw Buddha bowls but also some comfort foods that just happens to be vegetarian (burgers, buffalo cauliflower).  Price wise... they're comparable  but at first glance, Fresh seems more.  Fresh's space is crowded... the worst I've seen in Toronto.  We were only 4 inches from other tables and that is not an exaggeration.  It was pretty miserably bad and we heard EVERYONE'S conversation.  From the mean girls and the bride to the frustrated couple who hated the wait and being shoved into a tiny table.  I get that more seats means more profit but this was a real miss. They need to take out 2 tables of 2 in each row.    Aside from the really bad spacing, the place is clean.  But it's in an old building and so it has really bad lighting.  It feels really dark when you're sitting and this is on a sunny Sunday.  The walk to the bathroom really highlights how old and worn down the building is.   Service by the staff was really nice.  We had a sweet woman offer her ideas on what was good and really appreciated that.  The speed of the kitchen can be an issue.  I dont think we waited super long but it feels longer than you probably expect to put together a salad.  Buffalo Cauliflower - This an app and Im willing to bet if you had this item on a regular restaurant menu, even carnivores would love this.  I can actually vouch for this as I've seen people who are normally wolves and cubs just love this.  It is breaded and deep fried but its done well.  Hot, crispy, and with a nice spicy sauce.  The sauce isnt sweet or sour either so I dont mind it.  It does come with a creamy sauce.  Is this 'healthy' ... no. I would say the deep frying isnt healthy but its a great vegetarian alternative for chicken nuggets.  4/5  Detox Caesar with extra Hemp Seeds - This came as a mountain of vegetables on a plate.  I was actually surprised that this didnt topple over.  Lots of greens, tons of sun dried tomato, lots of shredded brazil nut 'cheese' on top, and an interesting 'bacon' that really was a nutty sweet tempeh.  It tastes more like sweet potato and nuts.  4/5  Ultimate Falafel Salad - This was even bigger than the detox caesar and anything coming out of K&K.  I actually made 2 meals out of this salad and so for me, this was a great value in addition to being a great taste.  The falafels felt breaded and crunchy... not your traditional take at all but I enjoyed eating it.  Lots of leafy greens, juicy cucumber pieces, many cherry tomatoes, crispy onions, mint, cinlantro, and spices from the tahini mint sauce.  Personally, I really liked this one a lot. 4/5  It's one of the better vegetarian places for flavour and offering.  I like this place compared to anything in Vegandale (aka Parkdale) BUT I feel the space really needs to be rethought.  I get that they're trying to turn a higher profit but maybe they need to speed up the kitchen instead of cramming people within inches of each other."}
{"text":"I'm going to go out on a limb here and generalize that:  1) If you are vegetarian, you really like Fresh  2) If you are not vegetarian, you think it's pretty MEH and overpriced  At least that is what I have noticed based on my experiences at Fresh (I've been to all three locations, go figure) and in addition to the Yelp reviews.  This location (as well as Bloor location) annoy me because the seating is so damn awful. They really cram the tables in very close together just to maximize capacity. I end up feeling like I'm sitting with the people at the tables on either side.  The food is OK. But the menu is not \"Fresh\". The menu is dated. Put something new on the menu for pete's sake, I've been going here 3 years and it's the same menu items. I do like their mediterranean platter and the baby energy bowl. It is definitely overpriced though. $13 for soba noodles and bean sprouts, please!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am NOT a vegan, so maybe I am biased.  I went here with some vegan friends and tried my hardest to be open minded.  The smoothie and Moroccan tea were my favorite part. They were excellent. The appetizers were okay. My favorite was the Indians dosas, or curry pancakes. The grilled cornbread was very dry. The onion rings fried with quinoa were okay, I expected a lot more from the \"avocado sauce\" it came with. I ordered the thai peanut sauce bowl with soba noodles and tofu. I HATE tofu but wanted to give it another try. Yes, I still hate it. The noodles were okay, sauce was decent. It was pretty filling but I am such a meateater that I totally didn't enjoy it. I tried. I should have ordered the veggie burger. We also had the chocolate cake for dessert and it was better than I expected, but it just tasted like vegan cake. Not very sweet or satisfying. I know vegans have a very restricted diet so this is probably a great place for them. But for an outsider, it's probably only best for smoothies.  The place itself is cute but very small and noisy and crowded. Service was okay, they forgot my friend's smoothie and we had to ask for it. Overall it's not somewhere I would want to go again unless my vegan friends insisted."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Helpful staff. Fresh tasteful healthy plates. Will become a regular if this place."}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit - I'm a carnivore.  But, whenever I feel like something light and fresh, I head to this place.  The food is super tasty.  The smoothies are out of this world.  You almost feel your arteries de-clogging."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant because I actually feel good eating their food and not guilty afterwards lol I always get their poutine. Make sure you ask for hot sauce. They have an in house hot sauce that is AMAZING. It is so spicy and flavorful and perfect to pair with the poutine. I always try to go here a couple of times during the summer, cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fresh is alright but I find their cuisine to be gimmicky and uncreative. It's kind of like the vegetarian restaurant in the imagination of a rabid meat eater. A lot of focus on whole wheat, smoothies, dubious health claims, meat substitutes, bland tasting greens. Less of a focus on great tasting cuisine. Vegetarianism doesn't have to be this gimmicky. That being it fills a niche in the city for a fast casual vegetarian chain and I appreciate its existence.  I found the service at this location very good and attentive. The interior is well designed and comfortable."}
{"text":"Expensive and delicious.  Where you go when you want something kale or a good fresh juice or inventive healthy veggie options.  This is the kind of place that's au courant in Los Angeles right now."}
{"text":"Upon moving to Toronto, Fresh was one of the first recommendations that I got; even better, it's right in my neighbourhood.  A friend from Montreal visited, and the two of us decided to take our health-foodie alter-egos there.   Full disclosure: I'm currently on the South Beach diet and trying to avoid grains; this turned out to be a hard task at a Vegan restaurant, as grains products are often the lifeblood (no pun intended?) of most vegan products.  Even though there was an impressive array of \"Gluten Free\" options, most of these were rice based, and I had to stay away from these as well.  In the end, I decided to avoid rice, and avoid processed wheat flour.  We started with the quinoa-battered onion rings, with the garlic mayo for dipping, and the curried chick pea dosas.  The puffed quinoa was an extremely successful onion ring batter.  It made the rings light and fluffy, but was sturdy enough to be the perfect vehicle for the garlic mayo.  My boyfriend opted out of this dinner once he read the menu and deduced that the burgers weren't made of meat; but I have full confidence that even he would chow down on these rings.  The star of the evening was the dosas: let it be known, first time dosa-ers, this is not what you think.  The description said that they were pancakes filled with chickpeas and vegetables; whatever we thought, we didn't expect a dish resembling enchiladas to come out.  The chickpeas and veggies were made into a thick puree that filled the rolled-up pancakes; and it was all surrounded by additional curry puree that turned out to be a great dip for the onion rings as well!  It was on the basis of this puree that my friend has decided to purchase the Fresh cookbook.  For mains, I got the Magic Tofu burrito on lettuce instead of in a tortilla, and my friend ordered the Buddha bowl with crispy tempeh.  She was convinced that my burrito would still come in a burrito shape, wrapped in lettuce; I have to admit that I wish it had.  It was delicious, but it was a delicious salad.  The most outstanding part of the entrees was the thai peanut sauce that was on the Buddha bowl - great flavor with the perfect spice kick!  Portions for the entrees were HUGE!  For any doubters out there that vegan fare is bland or \"rabbit food\", Fresh will change your mind!  The freshness of the ingredients, and the work they've put into the flavours is enough to make a stuffed, satisfied rabbit out of anyone!"}
{"text":"This is my first time but I have heard a lot of good reviews about them. We had to wait a few mins since it was super busy around 7pm. Prior to ordering the food, we were told it will take a bit longer for the food arrive since it is super busy and we were fine with it. We order the quinoa onion rings, vegan garlic mayo,mushroom onion burger and tofu kale salad. All the items were delicious and totally worth the wait. The ambiance of the place is a little too loud and snug. The staff are very friendly and honest about the items they serve. Can't wait to be back again to try other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent from start to finish. We were seated & served promptly, drinks came fast, and our appetizer was lighting fast. The food was all delicious, came out fast, and the server kept checking back with us. We were in & out quickly & comfortably. We even came back a second night in a row. Definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Fresh is one of those restaurants that people like to tweet about when they eat there, because eating healthy makes people feel good about themselves. I love the baby buddha bowl with crispy tofu on brown rice -- don't be fooled by the word \"baby\", as it's a generous enough serving for a full meal. Ask for the house-made hot sauce to make it even more delicious. I've also had weekend brunch here which is also nicely done; the Tex Mex Tortilla Scramble is a hearty and satisfying meal for $11.  Aside from the food, I also really like to make my own juice combinations -- my current favourite is apple, pear, pineapple and kale. If you get a 32oz juice to go, you get a take-home Fresh glass bottle and a 15% discount whenever you bring it in for a refill.   Be warned, as this location gets pretty busy (no reservations) and it's not uncommon to have to wait up to 20 minutes for a table during prime hours. If you're doing takeout, it's much easier to simply call ahead and place your order; it should be ready for you at the takeout counter when you arrive."}
{"text":"I end up coming here a fair bit for my juice fix. Love love their extensive juice menu and they have lots of great vegetarian options. I usually get one of their fresh pressed kale juices and one of their salads - there's a big selection and I've enjoyed all the ones that I've tried. This place gets pretty busy and its always a tight squeeze in the restaurant but I still keep finding myself coming back. Their soups are also delicious but I'm not a huge fan of their cooked foods. Come for the delicious soups and salads and a juice to go!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the juices and smoothies are great but as a Well traveled mostly veg-vegan ~ I find the menu choice boring as pretty much everything on the menu has tofu in it..  There are so many other foods to choose from, they could get some inspiration from traveling to California! I ordered the beach bowl (without tofu or cheese) and enjoyed it, but it wasn't a culinary experience by far! It's nice to have places in Toronto that cater to a vegetarian vegan crowd but in my opinion they could really benefit from a more creative chef! Overall the food was fresh the service pleasant and the company as well as the sunshine on the patio made it great, but food-wise.. Meh!"}
{"text":"All I can say about this place is WOW, YUM, HEALTH. I can definitely see myself coming back to this place again and again in the future. They have a huuuuuge menu, it was so hard to decide what to eat, and there were so many things I wanted to try! Since I came here for Saturday brunch, I decided to get actual breakfast food and got the blueberry almond pancakes (which are gluten free). I got the platter which came with scrambled tofu and grilled vegan sausages (you can also choose tempeh bacon). The pancakes were surprisingly thick and quite fluffy! I loved that they came with sooo many blueberries inside. The scrambled tofu was also delicious, as it was very well seasoned so it was quite flavourful. The sausages were probably my least favourite part of my breakfast, they were just mediocre and just couldn't compare to real sausages for me.  My friend got the Jerusalem bowl and it looked sooo so good. I was tempted to try a green smoothie, but was put off by the price, which was like $6 or $7 for a really tiny cup. The place in general is kind of pricey (pancake platter was $13), but I guess it is pretty comparable to Cora's and it is a lot more interesting and I'm sure healthier as well.  Next time I am definitely planning to try the quinoa onion rings which I have heard are awesome."}
{"text":"Going downhill as time wears on. Menu uninspired. Food undercooked. Order an $18 burger and it's not cooked properly. Service slow. Also they play seriously terrible music, like Britney Spears and N'Sync and early 2000's pop. The only reason this place gets even the 3 stars is the juices/smoothies/miso gravy are still great."}
{"text":"Please be aware that this is a vegan place where all the hipsters in this area come together and hang out.  If you are part of that hype this place is heaven for you.  Me personally is NOT a vegetarian or very fashion sensitive so my review is more for average folks.  The best on their menu are the salads and shakes. I haven't been a huge fan of salad all my life but Fresh got me. They have the best salad dressings that can make any salad tasty - I'm not talking about \"edible or good\" tasty (that's how I feel towards 90% of the salads), I'm talking about \"feeling like another one\" tasty.  Nutty Buddy is my favourite shake -just THE BEST shake.   You have options of rice or noodles for the fresh bowls but personally I like the rice much better. The noodles tend to get saggy after a while.    The things I don't like:  - looooong lines. omg every time it's a 20 mins wait at least. If you sit down, that's a 30 mins wait. I think they starve you on purpose so the food can taste better cuz you are super hungry by then. :P  They do have ready-to-go salads and wraps at the front though.   - expensive. I don't know your budget for lunch but $10 for a salad is just a little too much for me.   - burgers. I don't like the patty to be specific. It's not fake meat but it's not veggie either. I don't know what they put in there but just taste weird."}
{"text":"Yummy! Quinoa onion rings (you only get five rings tho) Sicilian tomato soup (lots of beans) Tempeh bacon  Reasonable prices for vegetarian/vegan restaurant.  We went Sat night at six and got a table for two in about 15 min. Closer to seven tho, the line up went crazy!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to every Fresh location multiple times and you can always count on them all to deliver consistent taste and fast service. They're usually busy, bustling, and at times even a little overcrowded feeling. But this is an overcrowded city and a busy restaurant means its probably pretty good right? Spoiler alert: it is. I'm writing today on this location only because its the one I visited most recently.  A few years ago I was bummed when Fresh took one of my favourite wrap sandwiches in the city - the Sam Houston burrito - off its menu. But today I'm pleased to report Fresh has regained its place in my heart as best food bundler with their new buffalo wrap. The wrap houses their regular delicious tofu chunks with that buffalo sauce flavour you know and miss from chicken wings, plus a vegan ranch dressing and crunchy shaved carrots, lettuce, and some tomato. Its saucy and drippy and you will need napkins, but I think sometimes thats a sign of a great meal.   Not as weirdly obsessed with buffalo hot sauce as I am? Other menu items which have never let me down are: the quinoa onion rings, the Indian dosas, the mighty greens, the energy bowl, and the tiger bowl. Plus a special shout out to the miso gravy and the house made hot sauce. I could put both on (almost) anything and be happy."}
{"text":"Good but nothing crazy.  Very standard in terms of ingredients and food quality. There's nothing that's too outstanding. A bit pricey for what you get too. But overall a good spot for something healthy."}
{"text":"Probably one of my all time favourite Vegan-Vegetarian restaurants.  The staff are friendly, helpful.  Even on busy nights, i understand that they do the best they can to provide exceptional service.  The food is always a pleasure here.  You've got to try out their Vegan Poutine, it is awesome.  Then follow that with their mushroom burger.  It is hard to believe that it is really vegetarian. I think they do a great job making it taste really close to a hamburger.  I also love that they also include fresh water and provide refills regularly.  Their salads are fantastic here too.  I still have yet to try out their breakfast menu, but i'll give that a try when i come around to remembering.   The other items worth trying are the vegan chocolate cake and their hot cocoa - they are delicious as well.  But the one thing that always comes to mind when i come here will always be that amazing vegan poutine.  Its so much more vibrant than eating the standard poutine that has animal gravy.  In this one, they use mushroom gravy instead and believe me, it is worth it!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a smoothie place in the area. Fresh is one of the few places that serves them. There is a deal after 2:30pm where you get a dessert with your take-out order. I ordered a 16 oz breathless (mango, strawberry, and banana) and a cupcake. The cupcake was decent. The frosting was nice. I thought the smoothie was a little too watery. I've had better smoothies for cheaper."}
{"text":"Not too shabby but nothing too impressive either.   I love trying different vegetarian restaurants around town and was looking forward to this one.   Positives: - they had a deal where medium size smoothie was same price as large size smoothie. I tried the Green Dream which was good but I got to say, I had better green smoothies! It has a nice minty taste but felt very watery and nothing special. The price was great though, it was $5 for a large cup smoothie.  - lots of options on the menu - outdoor seating   Negative: - pricey $$$. The \"regular\" size bowls they had was $20 if you wanted it with soba noodles instead of rice. That's preeetty expensive in my opinion.  - tastes pretty average! Nothing too special and kind of bland. I got the Buddha bowl with soba noodles and had to add a lot of hot sauce to it.   Tip: - get the baby size bowls. They are pretty fair in portions and much cheaper than regular size bowls.   The only reason I'd want to come back is to try their green poutine. It looks awesome! Probably should have ordered that instead."}
{"text":"I wish I had stumbled across Fresh earlier. I commuted to Toronto every other week for 2.5 years (it's just ended) and only found Fresh in the last few months. Well I made up for lost time enjoying their amazing goat cheese, pesto and red pepper sandwiches for lunch and sometimes gradding a Tempeh salad to go. In the evening I would always go for either the California or Vegan Ceasar salad and if I wanted a burger, the Miso bean burger is just delicious.  The staff were always super friendly and it is just a great little restaurant plain and simple.  I miss it."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like Fresh....the staff are nice, the food is healthy, the juices are fresh and the decor is great.... but the food is extremely bland.  I know it's vegetarian and vegan, and that sodium is not good for you - but even a tiny pinch would go for miles for the food!  Similarly, most of the flavours are not fused together - there is not much usage of marination here.    I always have trouble ordering things on the menu - have learned after coming a couple of times that the thing with the most flavour are the veggie burgers.  The miso one and the mushroom onion one are not bad.    All in all, a good and quick spot for healthy veggie food.  However, if you are looking for some amazing veggie/vegan food, go to Fressen a little bit West on Queen."}
{"text":"I like coming here after a workout at the gym because after 7pm they always have a half price deal on one of the juices and an entree, so it's much more affordable (the main reason I haven't given Fresh five stars is their astronomical prices!). The juice flavours and options are limitless and very tasty.   My favourite thing on the menu is the daily soups (butternut squash & ginger, black bean & dill, tuscan bean are my top picks) and the Magic Tofu wrap - super delicious!!"}
{"text":"Fresh is by far my favourite vegetarian restaurant. I love their Beach Bowl with goat cheese on rice. The portion size is huge, so I usually pack up the rest and save it for lunch the next day. The options here are vast and I have even successfully converted some of my \"vegetarian food is boring\"-type friends to love Fresh! Their burgers are delicious and perfect for those who want to try vegetarian and not feel like they're eating rabbit food.  I go to the Fresh on Bloor and on Spadina and both locations are very busy. The wait isn't too bad if your party is small, but it is definitely worth the wait. Not the best place for people who like a lot of space, as you will be sitting very close to other people in the restaurant. On days when I need some peace and quiet, I'll call ahead for pick-up and eat in the comfort of my office/home."}
{"text":"I love this place! As a native torontonian who lives in Houston, I come here anytime I'm in town. Being vegan this place is heaven for me..my only problem is making a decision about what to order. The quinoa onion rings are sooo good and a must have! I tried the black bean burrito and it was delicious. Oh almost forgot...try their homemade hot sauce, it's amazing...so good, I'd love to buy a bottle. I recommend Fresh to all my friends and anyone visiting and looking for a delicious and 'fresh' meal. Will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious. Some of my favourites: - Date almond smoothie, hold the maple syrup (it's quite sweet w/o it) - Tofu tacos - the sauce it comes with is sooo good - Tomato soup - amazing - all of their soups are really good & are healthy - House salad - that dressing is addictive - Slaw - comes on the side of the thai burger - Thai burger - a twist on the traditional hamburger - very yummy  And I could go on. It's definitely one of my top 3 favourite restaurants in Toronto. Only downside is it can get quite loud.  Oh, and if you join the Toronto Vegetarian Association ($25 per year) you get 15% off take-out."}
{"text":"Great flavours in the Bbq burger with the quinoa onion ring. I was just disappointed that they charge so much for every little extra thing you want to add though and even for sides.  This restaurant is a hit and miss though.  I had the falafel tacos last time and they gad absolutely no flavour. The poutine was good but I wish they had a smaller size option.  The space needs to be renovated so there's more room at the tables.  They brought the latte in a regular glass instead of a mug or tall mug. Presentation was not considered.  Overall it was an ok experience and service was slow."}
{"text":"I've been to all 3 locations, multiple times.  This one is my favorite because of how boss they are with take-out orders.  They have BY FAR the best organized take-out scenario, and have a little counter set up for you to grab extra sauces, napkins, etc. AND there is room to stand around in this location while you wait (comparatively).  If you're a Fresh virgin I recommend the soups, the cornbread, the sweet potato fries and any of their terrific smoothies.   Healthy eating goes great with Movember, PS, it is all about men's HEALTH."}
{"text":"Best Juices. [because they are fresh] Good Food. [because it's vegetarian, and this place is run by veggies who care.]  Point off, because sometimes the staff's that stuffy [i'm better than you vegetarian types].  Otherwise, all round good. Oh and a point off because I like meat, and can be biased in my review on a vegetarian place.  I recommend this place for fresh juice. Delicious food [with no meats]. Good for lunch."}
{"text":"Kinda surprised it took me over three years of living in Toronto to try out Fresh! I ordered the Squash Tacos and they were DELICIOUS, especially once I added a little extra of their hot sauce! Will definitive be back again to try their bowls!"}
