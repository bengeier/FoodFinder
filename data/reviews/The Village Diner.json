{"text":"The BEST DINER EVER!!!! We love the staff and one of our favorite waitresses Ms. Nanci!!! These diner is a must \"eat\"...lol!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast spot!... Or lunch... Or brunch... 
Just went here for the first time. 
We.will.be.back!

You're greeted immediately by a friendly waitress. Decor is nostalgic but a little modern, very fun. Menu had a lot of great options but wasn't overwhelming and the prices were VERY reasonable! 
Service was fantastic, glasses were always full; we even spilled out coffee and the waitress was over immediately with rags and napkins. Like it never happened. 
We ordered the hot apple pancakes and the village sandwich (I think is what it's called) which was egg, cheese, turkey sausage on a croissant. Food was delicious! Pancakes were huge and fluffy! Not dense and mealy like other chain breakfast spots. Apples had a good bite to them and the whole thing was well balanced, didn't even need syrup. The sandwich was also fantastic. Wasn't greasy or heavy. 
We also got the hash browns... If you remember, add the grilled onions! So worth it! I'm a huge fan of hash browns and these are easily the best in town! 
We were told that on weekends they have chicken and waffles, plus the lunch menu had tons of great looking things we want to try. Will be back with the kids next time!"}
{"text":"Wonderful diner with friendly owner/operator ready to greet and each guest. Prices are very reasonable and portions are generous. I recommend the scratch made chili with just the right amount of heat for me.  Open for lunch and breakfast."}
{"text":"claims they deliver on Yelp, when I called in to place an order the woman was rude and was didn't even know the minimum order size for delivery. it also is listed NO WHERE on the website or on Yelp as other restaurants do. after having asked for her to check with her manager about the delivery minimum she replies with \"fine\" and comes back only to say no. it needs to be $40+. outrageous. I like 0.6 miles away from the restaurant. almost absurd."}
{"text":"One of our favorite to go places for breakfast. Great price for the amount of food they give you. For 15 dollars , two people can have a great hearty breakfast and everyone is nice there."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. The waitress was actually mean to us. Awful service and SO slow. It is heartbreaking because we live nearby and would have loved this to be our go to spot. Can't go back again. 1 star because the food was tasty.  Not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"Great classic breakfast, sausage biscuit and gravy, lots of options on the menu and service staff were very friendly!"}
{"text":"This place has everything a hometown diner should have - cheap, affordable food, clean yet cozy environment, servers that seem to know every regular, huge portions. I've been there twice, and the first time I went the owner was working the register and said she came in all the time just to work. I heard half a dozen people greeted by name when they were served and asked about their lives.

The one thing to be aware of at this place is the wait. The first time I went, I was seated right away and had no issues. The second time, no one came to greet me so I sat at the counter and ordered just fine, but I watched a family walk out because they were seated in the back and no one had come to take their orders in 25 minutes. If the place seems busy, you may have to flag down the waitress to get served or sit at the counter, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I don't know who gave this Diner a 4 star. But it is clearly not 4stars. The white male waiter is rude. The home fries were burnt and sandbagged. Pancakes were like rubber. Say yourself trip and expense. DO NOT GO... #sonotworthit"}
{"text":"Great improvement with new owners!  Well done.  Keep up the good work.

I am new to the area and tried this place Aug 2015 and was not impressed. Eggs were bland, no flavor, as if from liquid or powder.  Vegetables bland and dull in color as if frozen and thawed several times over.  Not knowing that ownership changed, I reluctantly went back in Aug 2016 and was pleasantly surprised by the improved food quality and flavor.  Had the greek omelet with gyro meat and home fries with grilled onions added.  Everything tasted fresh and homemade.  Later looked up the diner online and found that owners had changed hands, which made all the sense in the world.  Atmosphere is bright and friendly.  Lots of interesting specials on the chalk board, including apple cinnamon waffles.  Seems like it has lots of regulars.  Definite gem for our area."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland this week. Thanks to Yelp thought I would try the Village Diner. Got here a little before noon just before the lunch rush. Looks like the \"locals/regulars\" eat here often. Love it when people are greeted on a first name basis. 

The Mushroom cheese burger was very good. Love when the cheese is melted under the broiler. 

Fries served nice and hot. The place is very clean. People are friendly. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"I like this place! Cutest diner decor and definitely a place for locals and new people like me. I went around 9am on a Tuesday so it wasn't busy. The prices are awesome and portions are generous. The older lady serving me was adorable and attentive. She checked back in with me and was fast. 
LOVED the homefries with onions. They didn't just fast track it a flip flip so it crisped the outside and mush in between...they cooked all of the potatoes!! Guys, that never happens! I was so happy. 
Only thing I didn't like was the sausage links-I'll try something different next time!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn tasty.  Great dinner fair. I had the chicken and waffles and was stellar. So fresh and tasty.  I'll be back because the other stuff coming out looked amazing."}
{"text":"A small town diner with friendly staff and good, inexpensive eats. The potato and onion hash is the star of the show. It is a can't miss side. The veggie omelet is heavy on vegetables and flavor. The coffee is all right and comes with a wide variety of creamers to suit your tastes."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is very nice, attentive and is the only place in the area that carries my fav breakfast, eggs florentine!! I definitely recommend this place! A+++"}
{"text":"Great food! Just had the chicken soup! Delicious!!  Homemade mashed potatoes perfect for cold day!  Real diner feel!!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Second time here, probably not a third. It was busy, but no excuse for an exceptionally long wait to receive our order, which was incorrect. The wait staff was very nice but honestly probably not up to the task of a busy pace. The incorrect order seemed like it was the norm, as our waitress just basically said no not again.
Prices were good, maybe just stick with weekdays."}
{"text":"Pretty good little local diner. I had breakfast here one morning before heading out for a meeting.

I sat at the counter and ordered the sausage gravy and biscuits, two eggs over easy, and corned beef hash, plus coffee.

The sausage gravy was pretty tasty, the texture of the biscuits was a little weird, not the flaky kind of biscuits I like, the texture was more like dinner rolls. The corned beef hash was your standard, canned corned beef hash. The eggs were cooked properly - a little runny to mix into the hash.

Service was a little on the slow side, but I was in no hurry."}
{"text":"OK WHAT?! I've gone here now a few time since like... 2015. Third times a charm?! I mean, the other time were good enough. All diners are pretty good in my opinion! This time I ordered the Country Boy breakfast bowl and WOW. I am a fan of the combination and even though each part of the dish is usual (omelet, biscuits, gravy, potatoes), I have never seen them all combined before. Special shoutout to the sausage gravy for actually having flavor!

I could have sworn I'd written a review last time I went, about how my sister got a dirty cup of water. Well I don't know if it was actually dirty, maybe it was steamed cleaned, but there was a lipstick ring on it. So definitely not scrubbed! That does make me wary about the cleanliness and cutlery, hence 4 stars. But I'm down with the food."}
{"text":"Fantastic diner - great food and friendly staff.  I had a gluten free breakfast sandwich and my husband got pumpkin French toast, scrambled eggs and hash browns (which were delicious shredded potatoes and crunchy on the outside).  It was a busy Sunday afternoon.  We were seated right away and thoroughly enjoyed the meal, the atmosphere and the service.  One tip:  Waze takes you to a spot about 1/2 mile away on Miles.  Continue to the intersection of Miles and Brainard.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This diner is very clean.  The fries are hand cut and fried twice to make them crisp.  

I had the New Yorker sandwich and it was delicious."}
{"text":"So want to love this place.  Have tried to make it my go to as it is close and, more often then not, good food. I think the new owner gets overwhelmed on busy weekend mornings. Servers are generally good, but they are overwhelmed as well. Coffee refills can be hard to get, plates hot from standing under heat lamp, toast forgotten ( never did get it because server never came back). During the week much different story. Fast friendly, decent food. Maybe it would benefit marcy, the owner, to have a floater on the weekends to refill coffee and check in on guests. I'm glad you are having so many customers, but you have to find a way to make it work on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, friendly staff. Get onions with the home fries.  Came here on a business trip and it was so good we ate breakfast here everyday."}
{"text":"I really need to come back here and try it again!! There's no way hashbrowns are served like that all the time. It was really busy and they seemed to be under staffed!!
3 stars for right now. Food was decent but not great. I will return because I just know in my heart this place has good food."}
{"text":"Friendly Service OK Food. The owner was on site and greeted us warmly as we told her we were 1st time visitors to her diner. My companion had standard breakfast fare, biscuits and gravy. I had a bite and it tasted homemade (or as all good cooks say, \"semi-homemade\"). I looked for an open-faced roast beef sandwich but there was none on the menu. The waitress said meh, we can make it for you no problem. 

Now that menu item for me is a test at any new restaurant, because I've had really bad open-faced roast beef sandwiches, believe me. This was good, tender roast beef over thick bread. The rest, well meh, mashed potatoes and corn as sides are standard. They weren't bad though, and I've had bad sides too. The sandwich plate was $10 and while it was OK, I didn't think it was $10 good, you know? 

I had a cup of chicken noodle, and the broth was good but it was teeny noodles, almost like ramen and had way too much celery in it and not enough chicken and noodles for my liking. 

Our bill came to $23 so that's not exorbitant. The service was friendly and fairly prompt, and that matters. We would go back if we're in the neighborhood. It is key to note they are only open until 3 PM every day."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu tastes GREAT!!!! Service is good and the owner is so friendly and welcoming! Must go check it out!!"}
{"text":"A great spot for breakfast!!!!!  Eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns are NOT to be missed! (And add the onions!)  The chicken and waffle was the best I have ever tasted.  (Took a bite of my son's)  Everything made from scratch.  We will definitely be back!"}
