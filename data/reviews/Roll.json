{"text":"The food is great. The server was really nice too. I would know whos bad or not and he was speaking in attentive manner for sure. Definitely a place to go to eat quick korean food or take out. Their kimbobs and other snacks were big in portion."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch and had their cold buckwheat noodle with veggies $7.99  It comes with 2 side dish, kimchi and yellow pickled radish. The shaved ice which is suppose to be the broth was very watery, therefore it didn't have a lot of flavor, and because it was watery it took longer for the ice/broth to melt.   The restaurant is very small, and the lady that serves you doesn't smile, so if you expect service don't come here, but if your here for just a quick meal with no expectations..then this place is ok"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food! Very authentic! Korean sushi is different from Japanese sushi(what we usually get at a sushi restaurant), and this place has some really good Korean sushi!"}
{"text":"Bad experience. I don't usually write reviews but feel compelled to do so for this one. Had high hopes for this one based on other reviews and how much we want to find a good kimbap place. Overall, slow customer service, food is mediocre and the restaurant itself doesn't seem very sanitary. Why are the staff shredding cabbage and preparing the food out in the open in the dining area beside the guests who are eating/about to eat their meal?"}
{"text":"I love the egg rolls here! The staff may not speak much English, but thank goodness they have an English menu! It's a little pricey for Korean food, considering we're in uptown Korean Town.   My take out order was ready in a jiffy, and it seems most of the customers order for take out since the restaurant itself was empty. The servers are very nice and helpful when I had questions about a dish. We probably looked like fools waving our hands around attempting sign language.   The sushi rolls are pretty standard, I suggest Sushi Bong just a few stores down the Northtown Way circle.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"The best authentic Korean food I've been to in Toronto.  Their kimbap is the best Korean Kimbap in town, especially the tuna, and I love their Tteokbokki and spicy cold noodle. My go-to take out place especially in cold winter days like today."}
{"text":"Just ate a Bulgogi Bento (beef Bento).  I can honestly say it was delicious, and at a reasonable price of $12.50+ tax.  They give you complimentary green tea and Miso.  I really liked the beef and dumplings.  The salad and veggies were also good.  I don't know much about Korean food, but this little place is recommended.  I'll give it 4-stars since I haven't really compared to other places, but it was a great dish.  C.L."}
{"text":"One of the best gimbap in town!!   The rice is still a bit warm (which I was told what an authetic kimbap should be) and the stuffing are fresh and tasty. I have tried the kimchi kimbap and tuna kimbap. both of them are very nice.   reasonable price too!"}
{"text":"These people do Gimbap right 5*s for ONLY their Gimbap. Everything else that we tried they don't really do justice.  We ordered the bulgogi and the kimchi gimbap and it was so bomb. This isn't your average get full korean restaurant, its more of a snacks and chill. If you want like good hearty spicy dishes you'll get full from you'll be disappointed (or at least I will be).  Neither of their gimbaps were overpowering when it came to flavour and they offered the classic pickled yellow radish and kimchi with soy sauce as dipping which was amazing and on point.  We also ordered deokbokki and rabbokki and it was okay, I've had better but the Gimbap here is definately the best. That's what theyre literally named for."}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? Damn I should have tried the Kimbap. Didn't appreciate that they didn't have lots of non-spicy dishes so ended up ordering some noodle with fish cakes. I was first eyeing the kimbap but decided not to since the ingredients didn't really stand out to me (Tuna or cheese or beef?). I guess I'm not really used to these ingredients in a roll. There were only a few side dishes and they weren't my favourite so I didn't really have any. My elite friends ordered a Korean instant noodle and Kimchi fried rice. The Fried rice was actually not bad. My noodles portion were really big but seemed to be lacking some flavour. I didn't end up finishing it because just seems a bit boring the dish. Seems like a noodle dish you just whip up at home.   I kind of get a feeling this place provides \"Home-cooked\"-like Korean dishes and seems to be a favourite amongst students and younger people. The prices were very reasonable. The decor left more to be desired and there were flies and bugs everywhere. That's probably because they left the door open for better ventilation. The waitress wasn't that fluent in English, we had troubles communicating. Overall, the food was okay, nothing really stood out to me. It's another one of those Korean places for people with a more spicy palate. Needless to say I will most likely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Searched all over Yonge and finch for Kim bap, stumbled on this gem on the way back to the car. They have about 6 types of rolls, I ordered 2 of the vegetable one which was $3.49 for a roll.  Delicious , crunchy and what was I craving for!  The resto was a little tiny and humid, simple and diner like but quick service and very friendly!  4 stars because the restaurant lay out was not cozy to my liking but did take out so did not sit and eat.  Will come back."}
{"text":"This place is called roll dot com (cute name). If you like kimbap then you should roll yourself here (pun intended :p). I had takeout tonight, ordered their tuna kimbap because I love tuna and kimbap just tastes better with tuna! Their tuna kimbap is huge and costs 5.49, not bad at all! This will definitely fill you up. Service was quick and I'll come back if I'm ever in the area - which is always lol."}
{"text":"Lunch is cheap and healthful and especially goo for takeout. Not a big fan of the space, it tends to be not cosy and has a loud tv."}
{"text":"Small place, almost a hole in the wall. A variety of typical korean dishes. Small tables. Definitely not a place for a big party. Korean run.  Had: Ramyeon with dumplings ($5.99) - nothing special. 3 dumplings, fairly standard, tastes similar to frozen Korean dumplings. Raymeon was standard. Had bits of egg in it (not a whole egg insofar as I couldn't find a proper sized yolk anywhere). More like egg pieces. Also topped with a couple bits of shaved carrot. Served with kimchi and pickled radish. First time my pickled radish tasted like carrots. Hm....  Friend had the shrimp kimbap ($5.99) - 9 pieces. Shrimp was tempura shrimp. Had egg omelette and avocado as well as shrimp, among other things. Avocado looked super fresh. My friend said it was lukewarm (as in not cold). She enjoyed it.   Clean atmosphere. Good service. Pay at the counter. Tip jar."}
{"text":"The food is not only delicious but it has that homey taste like food from home. Would recommend the their soup, stew and tokbokki."}
{"text":"My next Friday night adventure at Roll dot com (aka kimbap dot com) is the tteokbokki (aka ddeokbokki aka ddukboggi aka ddukpoggi aka the Green Lantern but you don't hasta call me topokki[1][2]). However you spell it, you can order by saying \"duck po key\".   The ajumma taking my order giggled at my order. A whitey ordering tteokbokki in a Korean restaurant is -- to quote the colorful language of Roddy Doyle in \"The Van\" -- like hearing a five-year old saying \"fuck\". It's unexpected.   The ajumma packed it up in a tight styro container that survived a trip my backpack. I handed over $3 and change.  \"Spicy\" she warned me. I try to slip into survival Korean mode at things like this to let the server know I have a grasp of basic Korean cuisine (a curious feature of the Korean language is it's actually impossible to learn Korean without learning about Korean food) and I'm not going to be back at night with kerosene soaked rags and burn their place down thinking some joker there spiked my noodles with Tabasco sauce.  \"Neh, neh. May-oon.\" (Yes, yes, spicy.)  \"Do you speak Korean?\"  \"Jak-un\" (a little)  \"Good!\" (big nosed devil is not going to be back with kerosene soaked rags and burn my business down)  \"Kam sa ham ni da\" (do you know how much kerosene costs these days? So not worth it.)  So what did we get for our $3 and space invader money? Well, not the best tteokbokki. But passable. Surely. There are no doubt regional variations and even variations by street in Korea. Maybe this was a variation I was unfamiliar with. I always like the kind with a boiled egg sliced or halved. No egg in this one. You get the basic tube rice cakes, the hot sauce (which is spicy and at the edge of my ability to tolerate spice), and the odeng fish (familiar to some as that little textured fish cake stuff you get as an appetizer at  a Korean restaurant). Found at the bottom were some shredded carrots and cabbage. I don't recall cabbage in any tteokbokki I had in Seoul. But it wasn't bad and actually enjoyable.   The stuff is also physically hot. Takes a good long while for it to cool down. You can also barbarian it up a bit by scooping it onto some rye bread.  _________________ [1] http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2906086 [2] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LztZu5s0-QU"}
{"text":"A taste of Korea! This unassuming snack shop serves affordable, tasty eats.  ++ Regular roll: a solid 10/10  Odeng: good fish cakes and a good broth  Kimchi: properly ripened kimchi is so rare, and this was a pleasant surprise  - - Chicken fried rice: I know I know, no self-respecting Korean person would order this, but my non-Korean partner HAD to go wth this as the safest option that is not too spicy or too weird. In short, it was a disaster and a waste of hard earned money. Frozen veggies were all too familiar to us and seasoning was MIA.  I'd absolutely go back, but stay clear of chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"Very professional and polite to the customers. Nice tuna&cheese kimbob! Love their foods and those reminds me authentic Korean food back home:)"}
{"text":"nice place, had blood sausage and pork soup. it was very tasty and portions are big."}
{"text":"This place is very small and cute. Definitely not big enough to fit more than 4 people but I recommend doing take out instead. I ordered the kimchi kimbap and Tteok-bokki and it was surprisingly very good! This place is also very affordable! The only down side about this is that it's located on Yonge street which means street parking if you drive."}
{"text":"Let's just say even though it was -17 and snowing outside... I still traveled to this place. Whenever I have a craving for a snack, it's a must! The place is quite small so there's not a lot of room for dine in but takeout is worth it too. The prices are surprisingly not too bad and below average even though the servings are generous. Service was very friendly and polite.   Recommendations:  kimchi kimbap and rappoki. Even thought I'm not a big fan of kimchi, the kimchi kimbap is a must have every time I go. The texture and the taste fits so well together. As for the rappoki, I've noticed that the sauce is a little different then the ones you order from other places. Their sauce was a little sweet but the after taste and effect will numb you! Spicy but so good!"}
{"text":"I do not recommend their delivery service!! I guess because they do not have the personnel or English to provide the service they give you another phone number to text.. The first time I did this with Roll it worked out fine. The second time I ordered through a number they provided some punk gangster kid showed up and basically scammed us! He said the total was $80 which we thought that was high but we paid and then when we looked at the hand written receipt with just a written total we found that he over charged us by $30.00!! He said it was the delivery fee! When my boyfriend asked for a proper receipt that itemized the costs he said one moment, went back to his car, and drove off. We did not bother to call to complain, instead they have lost our business and our friends business. This is super low class embarrassing service."}
{"text":"First of all, the customer service here is just RIDICULOUS! I usually go to Sushi Bong a few doors down (a VERY good sushi place, by the way!), but I've been wanting to check this place out since Yelp Reviews say that they have really good tuna kimbap and that I'm missing out if I don't try it. I walked into the restaurant and there was only one young gentleman waiting on tables and doing take-outs. There were only 2 tables that he needed to serve and I get that he needed some time to finish handling all the orders/giving out food before he can attend to me, whether sit-in or take-out. But, the guy should at least tell me to just wait a minute or have a seat while he's serving others instead of just staring at me and not say anything. It was my first time there and I had no idea if I should wait at the cashier for him or what. If I didn't want to try the 'famous' tuna kimbap, I would have left with that attitude.   I ordered the Tuna Kimbap to-go. I paid for it and then had to wait 5-10 minutes for it. The problem with this guy again is that he doesn't communicate with the customers. As in, I asked to pay with my credit card and pressed in the numbers in the machine, but he NEVER said that I needed to pay $0.50 more if I paid with credit card. I asked him about it and he said it is because I asked to pay with credit card. There was NO notice saying that customers needed to pay extra if paying with credit card or only allowing credit cards over a minimum amount. He should have at least told me, but he didn't. I should have refunded my order.   The Tuna Kimbap was way overpriced! At $6.20 (tax included), it was seriously a rip off. I am not sure why other Yelpers think that their kimbap is awesome, but it tasted the same as the ones that I can get at a nearby Korean supermarket. At that price, I would expect a bigger roll with more (fresher) ingredients. There's nothing special about it.   I think I'll stick to the sushi rolls next door."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the Kimbap  restaurants back in Korea.  Very kind and nice server. The food is alright, the combos are a nice touch. A good place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I had to double check the photos and address to make sure I wasn't reviewing the wrong restaurant. Not sure why the reviews are so high. Between a 2-3 star for me. Anyway, I loved that the prices are very affordable, but that does not mean you will leave feeling full.   Went here with two elites and we were able to get a table right away on a Monday evening. However, we only received two appetizers. Perhaps they ran out of apps that evening? I ordered the  Kimchi Fried Rice. It was very tasty but the portion wasn't that big and I was actually able to finish it all.   Quite a bit of mosquitos lingering our table. Please don't bite me...  I would not recommend eating the ramen here as it seems they might be using the noodles from the spicy Korean instant noodles. I saw a bunch of the packages stacked inside the kitchen. You can get this at any Asian supermarket for a $1 ish.   Waitress was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Love their kimbap. I have spent many years walking by this Korean restaurant only to find out that I'm missing out on really great Korean fare.   Ordered the rappoki with cheese and cheese and beef kimbap. Between 2 of us, we were super full and had leftovers to take home.   The only complaint I have is that there was not a lot of rice cake in the rappoki! Maybe like 8 pieces in total. Everything was fresh and had the refreshing quality you would expect though.  TL;DR Order the kimbap for a cheap meal."}
{"text":"If the restaurant is called \"Roll.com\", one should clearly be eating kimbap! I got the Regular Kimbap to go ($4.50 tax incl.) which has tofu and veggies - it was made to order and I was in and out within 5 minutes. It was a good portion of filling, held together well, and had just the right amount of sesame oil. The place is tiny and clean but I can imagine it getting quite warm in the summer."}
{"text":"I love the kimbap at this place. I used to live close by and frequented this establishment every time my kimbap craving hits. There are so many options, but the kimchi one is still my favourite. You can get cheese added in as well which I highly recommend. I also appreciate how affordable this place is. Downtown has nothing that comes close."}
