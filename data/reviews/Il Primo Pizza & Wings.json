{"text":"This was my 2nd visit and not much of a change. Only one server so it was slower than before but the food was good. Kind of average sports bar feeling."}
{"text":"I pickup orders here all the time avg 75-100 bucks at a time. Kailey at the counter is horrible. Every time I go there she has a don't care attitude. 2 other workers there were watching our conversation and one of them had to correct little miss I DON'T care about the customer!!  Unbelievable. I like this place but they need someone else to greet people.  Great pizza and wings still."}
{"text":"We order Il Primo when we don't feel like cooking or going anywhere, and are unable to agree on any one food in particular.  That being said, Il Primo has something for everyone.  Appetizers, great subs and sandwiches (hot or cold), wedge salad is awesome (although the one last Saturday was kind of small), pizza, wings, burgers (really good burgers), home made potato chips (definitely go for the chips if delivery, as the fries get soggy as expected, and the chips are amazing).  The delivery people have always been friendly.  They let you customize anything for your picky eaters (even ordering on-line).  We have never eaten in the restaurant, but have used pickup and delivery.  One time this location had internet problems.  When we realized something was wrong, called the other location, placed our order, and they got it to us!!  (They used cell phones to contact this location.)  Really, how many places will go out of their way like that!  Our delivery driver told us about BOGO burgers on Wednesday.  Maybe some Wednesday we will remember that!"}
{"text":"I have given this place a try twice. The first time my roomie and I ordered a white pizza we were super excited to get it only to get food poisoning and be hostage to our house for the next 48 hours. So I think fluke incident went back and had a pizza and wings and it was sub par. Not a great place to eat in my opinion just greasy bar food."}
{"text":"Do not order from this establishment. They will double charge your card and act as though it is your fault. Horrible management and horrible customer service."}
{"text":"First time I had Il Primo Pizza tonight. Never again. I went to my sister's house for dinner. She and her husband ordered il Primo Pizza dilivery. They called at 6:12pm on 5/10/2017. And we're told it would be about an hour wait, as to be expected. At 7:40pm my brother in law call il Primo inquiring where their pizza is. After a 13 min conversation with the extremely? rude manager he informed the manager that I would be coming in to pick it up. The manager inturn replied that they still had to make it as they were unusually busy for a Wednesday night. When I arrive he was rude to me, no apologies for the wait, not even a good excuse to offer. He didn't know he was talking to a La Cordon Bleu Chef of 25 years. When I counted the 9 guest sitting at the bar and the other 12 sitting at various booths. I could help but wonder where and how all their unusual business went in the five minute drive it took me to get their. When the manager finally did present me with the pizza he the gull to expect a thank you from me. Hospitality is my business. This sack of shit should not be working in any hospitality establishment. I feel for the owner as my sister says she knows him and he's a nice enough man. I will never recommend this place to another as long as that manager is working their."}
{"text":"One star out of default...tried to call and place an order...after three tries she finally got the address correct...once again I wanted to place an order for 40 wings...I inquired about how much dressing I would get with 40 wings...I was told two containers...I asked how many I would get with 5 wings...I was told one...so for 8x's the amount of wings I get one more dressing....at $.50 each for additional containers forget it...what is wrong with these businesses...simple things make a big difference"}
{"text":"I love their food but their customer service (Carmen) is atrocious. There is something to be said about a business that doesn't value their customers. If you have tolerance for a sour face and mean attitude but love good pizza then this is the place for you. Do delivery so you don't have to be insulted and disrespected by the cashier."}
{"text":"I have been ordering pizza and wings here for years. The xlarge is smaller than it was. The wings are not always fresh, over done or? The people that answer the phone need training. I know they are just stating in the work force but the management should be paying attention."}
{"text":"this pizza tastes just like peter piper pizza.. except the games and such.. awesome crunchy wings prices are great.. they have live shows on special days.. really great staff.. the wibe is great. great atmosphere"}
{"text":"this has been the worst experience i have ever had!!!!!!!! placed the order over the phone requesting a x-large pizza 5 toppings with not thick crust ( in between thin and normal crust!) i also ordered 5 wings that would be flats not drumsticks!
order arrives 1 and a half hours later and the order was not what i ordered. call spoke to  joey the manager and he could not give a rat's ass about the problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i will never order from there, and as i was on the phone with him we then ordered barro's pizza!!!
have ordered numerous times from il primo, managers response lost my business and every person i can pass this on to!!!!

{"text":"Great place.Really good pizza, but the wings are fantastic!
 They always have \"specials\"   7days a week. Cheap beer too, coming back often"}
{"text":"Horrible service the people are really mean and they do not l care for any customers to be happy and become regulars"}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough. I really do not know why there are so many bad reviews on this place. Il Primo's pizza and wings is our family fav spot and friends of fam too. You will never taste better pizza and wings in Phoenix, AZ. 

As far as the comments about the interior of this place; This is coming from a girl who is very huge on decor of a place too... Trust me, there pizza and wings make up for their interior decor. When you think of those amazing whole in the wall eating spots, this is one. 

Tip: make sure you get the wings crispy and extra sloppy with medium sauce. You can dip your pizza in the sauce too and it's really good!! Mmmm"}
{"text":"El primo is pretty decent if you don't want to spend too much.  Pizza came out good and clean."}
{"text":"This place is the best kept secret in Glendale.  Excellent food, fast service - at least thats been our experience - and very good prices.   Two dollar draft beers during the week, man you cant go wrong.  Their pizza is wonderful

Only negative is their wings which are quite expensive for what you get.   But for pizza, theirs tastes excellent"}
{"text":"a+++ service and great food couldn't complain at all. great staff and good manager. Everytime I come here they are soo nice. The pizza rocks , reminds me of a place back home."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin on this one.
I came in the other night for some drinks and food with a few buddies, and the service was the most disgusting service I've ever had. First of all, the lady with glasses, who's name I don't know, or care to know for that matter, she was Asian and had shorts on...her attitude was absolutely pathetic. She was the insensitive person I've ever had the displeasure of knowing. She was bad at serving our drinks, constantly had an attitude, and the mouth of a sailor. I couldn't ask for something without her rolling her eyes, or giving me a hard time. My beers were a complete mess, because she didn't care to pour them right, and she wouldn't even ask us if we needed anything, when she could obviously see us waiting on our drinks. My buddies attempted to be nice, because I was clearly upset, and they got treated like total dog $#!@ 
I attempted to get someone's number to speak to in regards, but apparently you don't have a boss with a working phone number? So this is my first stop on a place to make sure this woman gets what she deserves. One of my friends said he's been in there many times when she's there, and he gets the same treatment as well. These are the people you want working for you? What a shame. Good food. HORRIBLE bartender. End of friggin rant!!!"}
{"text":"Still loving this place .Thank you girls.  Salad , pies and wings are Rock solid time after time.  If not twice a week at least once a week of some sweet pizza.  Oh yeah the ladies her have beautiful smiles too."}
{"text":"I usually go here to watch an nba game, one of my favorites pizza places, crunchy wings are the best thing in this place, i took one star because i ordered some fried mushroom and i got burnt mushrooms. Other than that great!"}
{"text":"Place was dirty. Food came out at different times and was not very good. I don't think I will ever be back there..."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Never had anything else on their menu-!but their specialty pizzas are very good! Delivery times aren't bad either, they always get here quicker than they said they would."}
{"text":"I am only giving this a star because I absolutely have to. I have NEVER had worse service by a pizza company in my life. I would literally rather order from pizza hut. I made an order at 916pm and gave credit card information and everything hoping for my order in 45 to 50 minutes. After an hour and a half I call and am told that my order wasn't even accounted for and was nowhere to be seen. I gave phone number and address and was told that my order didn't exist. Infuriated, I check my bank account and the amount of 36 dollars and some is pending on my account. So not only am I being billed for something I never received I am being treated rudely by the woman on the phone with me tonight. I have always been treated with horrible customer service when ordering from this specific location, but this is the first time I have never received what I ordered. I have been a loyal customer to this location and refuse to deal with this ignorance any longer. So little Ceasars it is tonight. And I pray that my card isn't charged or there will be a call to a corporate location. I have never encountered such horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings! But very disappointed,  management needs to step it up because it's so dirty in the dinning area the tables are NEVER clean at all. There was trash laying around the carpet and the broom was just sitting in one of the booths. All the employees just seem so lazy...then I go up there to get a box and the employees are eating in the back. On top of that one of the employees that was cooking the pizza was literally vaping! That is so disgusting!!!! Are the employees even washing their hands at all? So gross."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  It wasn't loud, the pizza, wings and the breadsticks were fabulous!!  We will be going back this weekend for more!!"}
{"text":"Been ordering here for years. Always great and on time. Love their food it's the best ! And they have great weekly specials. Wings are to die for."}
{"text":"Il Primo is amazon. They always have a delicious pizza and some of the best hot wings around. My family orders from them regularly when in search of a delicious Pizza, consistent quality and fantastic wings. The order time and delivery are very reasonable and prompt and always on time."}
{"text":"Best BBQ wings we've had in a long time!! The White pizza was delicious with fresh tomatoes and the barbecue chicken pizza is tangy and amazing. The only item I wasn't too impressed by was the mini pizza cookie....a little burned and ice cream tasted like the old box kind."}
{"text":"Ugh. Outside of getting our order wrong, their \"extra large\" pizza was not so extra large. In addition, it was gross. Not nearly enough sauce or cheese, and scant toppings. Wow....super disappointed. The wings were passable, but barely. Also, no carrots or celery. Amateur league, guys. Seriously..."}
{"text":"CONS:We used to go here all the time since we live right up the road but had a few bad times with food not being as good as it was. Today the food was ok but the 2 \"large\" pizzas were the size of a little ceasars pizza no joke, my 12 year old daughters 2 hands covered the entire pizza. When we used to go here this was the medium size. I was directed to look at the wall it showes their box sizes.well 1 a box size doesnt show pizza size so put the pizza round up & 2 i realized they now put different names to the sizes. the extra large is large the large is a medium & medium is their old small.I also ordered a large anti pasta which the girl ordered me a small anti pasta i might have caught this before the end when they gave me the food if she had given me a receipt. She never even apologised for her mistake. Also the 33 minutes i waited for the 2 pizzas & a salad with not a single order ahead of mine were spent watching her pick her nose while on the phone GROSS!!!!!! She then decided to give me a dirty look for seeing her pick her nose i get her being embarrassed about it but no need for dirty looks to customers & she probably should have washed her hands after doing that.
PRO:the food tasted fresh & one of the guys offered to fix the girls antpasta salad mistake for free which was nice since it wasnt my mistake to begin with.
My family & I have decided to stick with the place weve been going to the past few months called Lucky's pizza on 67th ave & Cactus."}
{"text":"One would think that with all the Midwest transplants, it'd be easy to find good Midwestern pizza. But no. 
The pizza, 1/2 mushroom/sausage and 1/2 cheese, tasted bland, like \"bar pizza.\"
I wouldn't get it again.
The service was good though--delivery was well within the time estimated and the driver was pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Be Careful! They use peanut oil and don't inform customers. It is not on their menus or on their website.

We actually enjoyed the food. We moved to Glendale a year ago and ordered from them regularly. My daughter developed a weird rash on her hands but we thought it was something in the house- we did everything our doc said, changed soaps, lotions, laundry detergents, etc. Never imagined it was peanut oil because we are diligent about ensuring that we stay away for all peanut products even highly refined oil as she has a reaction. Yet they never told us despite us letting them know that she is allergic to peanuts. We found out when my husband placed an order and the Manager said, \"Oh, we fry in peanut oil.\"

In a year, this is the first time we ever heard this. I spoke with the manager and explained how dangerous this was. He called us back to tell us that he spoke with the district manager who said that highly refined oil has the allergens removed and is safe for those with peanut allergies. I explained that that is not 100% true because while MOST don't have reactions, some do. And the problem is that they never informed us that they use this oil so that we could make the decision.  AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM. They took away our CHOICE by not informing us.

I posted on Facebook and someone apologized for the \"inconvenience,\" explaining why they use peanut oil, and offered a gift certificate. I declined the gift certificate because it is not about that. They endangered my daughter's health and we could have avoided this had they just informed us. I also posted a photo of the rash that she developed on her hands and they deleted my post on Facebook."}
{"text":"My first experience ordering from them was great! As people have said the wings are fantastic. If you are looking for a place to order pizza from and good wings are a must then I definitely recommend Il Primo. The pizza, although perhaps not quite spectacular, was also good and better than we expected. The delivery time was fair and the delivery guy himself was quite personable. I am sure we will order from them again, because we couldn't get enough of those wings!"}
{"text":"Rudest service in the world. Our food came cold, the woman hung up on me when I complained. I wasn't even being rude. I called back and was told the owners would call me and still have yet to call me.

If you want good service and pizza, don't go here. You'd get better service in a barn. 

Awful. Awful. Awful."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great atmosphere to watch football! You can see TVs from every seat, even out on the patio. Wings were great and pizza was average. They also had a nice selection of tap beers to choose from."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 10 years, since before they changed locations. Service is always hit or miss. Sometimes it's great and sometimes I wonder why I keep coming back. Dining in or deliver it is always a toss up. Deliver times are usually from 30-45 minutes but the pizza is not consistent. Sometimes it amazing and sometimes it's just ok. This theme carries out through out their menu. We usually get wings as well and we are never sure what we are going to get. Sometimes they are really crispy, sometimes they are not, sometimes they are saucy, and sometimes they are not. We frequent this place less and less as it's consistency has not gotten any better. I miss the old location. Since they have moved the quality and consistency has been declining."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for food but 1-2 stars for service! Ordered over the phone for take out and the deal was 24.99$ for large one topping pizza and 20 wings. Half pepperoni and other half with an additional two toppings. They charged me for 3 toppings on the whole pizza which only half had an additional 2 toppings, not 3! The guy that checked my order on the phone said ok that's 1.75$ for those two and I said ok. When I got there another guy checked me out who had a total if 33$...I was like no 25$ but $1.75 and tax is not almost 6$ which he replied it's like 11% hers and I told him it's more like 6% to which he argued. They apparently could not figure out how to fix my total bc it was a mistake they charged me for 3 whole pizza toppings instead of two half pizza toppings and a side of wing sauce that they did t include anyways!!!! My pizza and wings had been sitting there for awhile at this point and I had people waiting to eat so I had already wasted about 20 minutes with these guys. 
When they change their location maybe service will get better and I would consider their food again bc it's really good! As for the service it was sub par!"}
{"text":"My gf ordered a calzone with fresh mushrooms and sausage, and I ordered an antipasto salad. The calzone was huge-the size of a pizza! But there was no ricotta to be found inside. How bizarre. Also bizarre was the option of canned mushrooms in said calzone. Who would actually choose that? My salad was delicious, albeit skimpy on the pepperoni (I had two slices). The salad dressing that accompanied my order was generous. I had ordered an extra dressing for today's leftovers, but ended up not needing it. Our order together cost less than $20. Will definitely try again!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite quick and cheap pizza place to go to. My friend introduced it to me since it's right across the street from her, and man am I glad she brought me here. On mondays the large cheese pizza is only like $9! It's the freshest of ingredients for such a great price. This place is always quick and delicious. I love pizza so I am so glad that I found this place. My friend and I have ordered here 5 times in the past month or so haha! I can't wait to have it again."}
{"text":"My husband and children go there often.  It is convienient and entertaining.  We enjoy the Tue night sliders!  They are the best in town!  Kids like the sausage pizza.  The service is great and managers always are quick to help out and assure us if there ever is an issue, that it gets resolved.  There is plenty of room to watch ANY sports...several TVs to choose from!  We will refer...actually have referred and our friends love it.!   Thanks"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because my husband's boss likes to take his family for dine in. 
I ordered online for Pickup. (10 mile round trip)
The prices were ok. The selection was pretty good. The online coupons do Not work. 
Paid for my purchase (did get a $10 off of $60 coupon for informing the cashier that online coupons don't work). Believed I got Everything I ordered (bags tied, so no real way to check Everything, but appropriate amount of containers) and left. Got home to discover one box only had a piece of garlic bread in it, NOT the zucchini I had ordered. I go All the way back to get what they forgot and now the food is all cold.
This stuff may be Good when it's straight out of the oven, but cold it is just NOT!
If you live close, or want a dine in experience it may be a good place to go. Sports bar atmosphere. Just don't do carry out or delivery."}
{"text":"Best wings in town! My son and husband love their medium wings, I like the BBQ. Pizza is pretty darn good too! We recently moved, and the only bad thing is we are a mile out of their delivery area!!! Highly recommended by this family!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a trendy place this is not it. If you are looking for a good pie and wings than Il Primo is really good. I see some complaints about service but the service is decent just doesn't come with a smile. I'm an east coast guy looking for good pizza, I mostly do delivery so I don't care about the smile. in the valley of mediocre pizza this place stands out."}
{"text":"Great food great service!!! We love their food there and to go. We had a family function last weekend and more people then expected showed up. I placed an immediate order for 8 XL pizzas. They all tasted amazing and were ready for pick up quickly! Everything on the menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"A really really solid pizza place. The wings are good, their suicide temperature is what I would normally associate with a \"hot\", their \"hot\" to me feels more medium. Well cooked, with good sauce coverage. Their potato skins are also pretty darn good if you're looking to stray from the standard wing accompaniment to your pizza :)

My wife has ordered their house calzone a few times and says it's quite good. I'm pretty simple when it comes to pizza, I stick to cheese, pepperoni, or veggie. They do all 3 well. 

Oh, and their delivery guys are always really nice."}
{"text":"Great improvement from their old location on 59th Avenue.  This location has a nice outdoor patio with multiple TVs that look out toward the patio.  In fact tonight a group of friends and I took in the NFL Draft from the patio area.  There's a ton of TVs inside as well.  Food is pretty standard sports bar fare with a boatload of pub grub appetizers (including boneless wings).  Pizza is decent, though nothing special.  Servers are very friendly and attentive.  Altogether this location probably seats twice as many as their previous location and feels much more like a sports bar than a hole in the wall pizza joint.  Good comfortable suburban restaurant for an inexpensive lunch or dinner.  And now a great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Pizza looked great when It arrived, but after starting to dig in I was sharply disappointed. What looked great on the pan turned out to be a runny mess. The cheese they are using is runny and I don't mean soft and gooey, I mean running off the pizza and of the pan when you separate the pieces. I thought it might firm up as it cooled, but then it turned in to goo and I have to tell you it was a COMPLETE turn off..... GROSS!!!!! I can tell you I will never go back to eat at any Primos. It was the worst pizza I have eaten in years.

The service was also awful. No one was really on top us with service and the empty pans and plates were on the table in front of us for so long we actually had to clear our own TABLE!

The only good experience of the night was the entertainment of a live band.

Stay away if you know what's good for you!"}
{"text":"Came in Saturday night and loved the wings, pizza, and cheesy toast. Friendly, young,  blonde girl at the counter helped me quickly even though it was busy. Definitely will be back going to try dining in next time."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service... resonable prices... Nice menu from wings to Pizza to nachos... Had the bread sticks and they are awesome! Lasagne is tsty but needs the cheese layered... Lots of TVs... lots of parking. Not fancy, sports bar with good pizza!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been going to their original location since I was a kid- frequented it in high school for lunch and we saw the owner out during our senior prom and he chipped in for our bill at papadeaux! What a guy!! Their pizza never disappoints and the beer is always cold. One time when I was pregnant I was craving stuffed crust pizza, I called and asked them if they made stuffed crust pizza like Pizza Hut and the guy laughed at me, and then made me a stuffed crust pizza!!! Seriously where else can you get that kind of service?!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years for take out for a last minute dinner or a summer party. The pizza and wings never disappoint. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is I have to drive too far! Put one closer to my house please!"}
{"text":"Love it! Pizza is great! the appetizers are good. The Happy Hour is the Best!! 10 am - 7 pm! Love that they have Guinness on tap and it has happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"Our food took forever. SASSY WAITER. she asked for more root beer when my cup was full"}
{"text":"I came in here to order to get takeout it was 19.99 For 2 cheese pizza's ummm not so cheap. They only use 1 type of cheese the pizza was not great I wouldnt go that route again but I am willing to go back and try the Veggie pizza. I surprised my brother with some suicide wing's I dont eat meat but I did try the sauce and ate some w my pizza it was HOT. He loved them all 20 were gone at the end of the night. They said they were SO HOT but the boys just couldnt stop eating them. They said they were very good meaty and not too vinegary. An extra star for making the boys happy with the hella hot wings that night. FYI they probably use hydrogenated oils here by the way but I didnt ask!"}
{"text":"Love the new place! Great pizza, prices and this is a major upgrade from the old location. I will definitely be back now more frequently. Only complaint is food took a long time to come out."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 5 years not one issue and everything is delivered pizza is good wings are amazing with homemade blue cheese and ranch"}
{"text":"OMG I haven't been to El Primo in over a year I usually go to The Cave Creek and Bell 1 I took my son here tonight and we got pizza and wings to go the best pizza I've had even over Ray's Pizza definitely five stars"}
{"text":"To be fair, I only get pizza from here because it is ordered weekly by the financial office at my school where I present lectures for work study. I have tried the pepperoni, sausage, and cheese. I like that the personalized pizzas have a good crust, remain hot and cheesy with their delivery package, and the crispiness of the pepperoni. The personalized boxes and parmesan/hot pepper packets are a nice touch. They also always come with coupons on the box.  Nothing special, but it will be a long time before I say no to free pizza!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for decades and today I tried to call in a pick up order like normal but was hit with an issue. I was calling from my office and had to register with them to order a pizza. By register I mean provide my address and business name before I could order anything. Sorry but if I wanted you to know that information I would of called in delivery. To top it off the guy on the phone was a rude. Well I enjoyed your pizza but not that much. If my money isn't good enough for you then I will save you the hassle and never return."}
{"text":"Love the pizza! So far same friendly female waitress always there. Once when I was there my toddler fainted and threw up while unconscious and they were so helpful and kind while I had to rush out of there and take her to the hospital. Will never forget their understanding and help they offered since I was there alone without my husband to help."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and it was fast and hot. Pizza was absolutely great ! My husband is very picky and loved it. The wings were crispy and great sauces, honey-hot is my favorite. Wedge salad was perfect. Great blue cheese dressing. My son had chicken parmigiana and pasta. We will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Solid but average pizza.  We did a large pepperoni and got 10 honey BBQ wings.  The pie is standard stuff, similar to Barros.  The wings had a good texture but sauce was a bit too sweet.  Dig the ranch though."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, really more of like a dive bar vibe inside with loads of clutter sports bar feel. I think it's really cool not too bad for kids and family. I'm a wi he freak and the wings are average in size and flavor. Clean restrooms. This was my first visit and I would go again and try some different foods as they have a large variety to choose from I would recommend them for sure and may add a star after next visit."}
{"text":"Honestly, we walked into this place prepared to be disappointed. As far as pizza goes, the place doesn't look promising and I expected grease with cheese on it. You order at the front counter, go get it when they call your name, and eat off of paper plates with plastic utensils. Oh, and listen to 4 big-screen TV's turned up really loud and all set to different channels.
We ordered the bacon cheeseburger pizza, wings and a dinner salad. The large dinner salad was a bit small for the $5 price tag, but it was a decent salad. The wings were really good- awesome flavor and just the right amount of heat. The pizza was honestly great. Lots of toppings and a good hearty crust without being all grease and bread (and that's pretty impressive for a pizza with bacon and double cheese)."}
{"text":"Good pizza but minus 3 stars because this place is always nasty as hell. Not one clean table and bunch of employees messing around and I always have to ask for them to clean the table. 

This goes on while the lazy short haired lady manager is facetiming behind the counter. 

Horrible management all around. 

But good pizza."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, and wings. Pizza is so good. Dough is perfect, sauce is very tasty. We always get take out, and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"There is a lot of places that can deliver pizza, wings and sandwiches to your home or business in peoria.  I would not call them again. 
This place is average... food is ok... nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Oh what to eat, what to eat on a thanksgiving eve night when you have family over? Well heard about this place through a friend with high recommendations. This pizza place is its own establishment and has been on the corner of Bell Road & Cave Creek Road since my high school days (ancient times). Not sure what took me so long to give it a try but better late then never! I went with the large well done peperoni pizza and medium wings. Let me tell you that the flavors were impressive and the pizza sauce is one of a kind! The ammonia on the wings were not overbearing and the wings were very crunchy and fresh. My family from New Mexico was impressed as well and they love pizza. Will be back when I am thinking of ordering pizza!"}
{"text":"We ordered our pizza and wings online and used a coupon for $3.00 off the total. I then called and the gentleman noticed I overcharged myself and he fixed it when I arrived to pick up my order-- he saved me $6.00!! The pizza was half Italian, half pepperoni and cheese with sausage and it was really good. They only use the freshest ingredients, and bake it to perfection. The wings are to die for! They are hot and crispy. I ordered mild and with the blue cheese dressing, I couldn't have found a better match. I would highly recommend this pizza restaurant to anyone seeking quality pizza and wings."}
{"text":"great pizza, pretty fast and good quality and freshness.

This place is affordable, you have your usual big screens, the breadsticks were fantastic."}
{"text":"It's hard to compare anything else! The pizza here is so yummy along with the chicken wings and handmade breadsticks! 

Update* 9/2/17
Me and the wife ordered a white pizza, wings and some breadsticks. Been here numerous of times since my last review. The cook was having a bad day or needs some lessons on mild wings and how they should be cooked. They came out overly crispy and dry as hell. No sauce on them at all. After coming home I took it back because I was not satisfied and after charging $32 dollars on my account i wanted what I payed for. The girl in the front decided to school me about it's a butter sauce and that's how they cook their wings. Um, no sweetheart I don't return for dry wings. I keep coming to IlPrimo bc I love their pizza and wings when it's cooked correctly to their recipe. I've had better pizza, wings, and service then I had today. She also wanted to pull up my history on how many times I had been there before just to shut me up on me telling her I'm a loyal customer and I know how primo should taste like...  horrible.

1/27/18 Nobody has yet to comment on this complaint so there goes to show their true customer service ;)"}
{"text":"I am a big pizza and wing fan. Its by far my favorite food. And this is my favorite place to get them at. 

Their wings out the best ive had. No where can beat them. 

Their pizza is good, not great. But it goes good with the wings. You can get beer here too. They have tv's also inside. 

Great spot especially if youre looking for some wings."}
{"text":"Horrible service with upset employees.. Never a smile and always looking mean.. The service must change, food is alright for the most part!!"}
{"text":"This place just sucks. The pizza is pretty bad, doughy and the sauce straight out of a can has a tinny taste to it and I'm not sure if it's really cheese on top. The wings are scrawny and overcooked The half-pint manager guy Mike acts like he's doing you a favor a real ass. Save you money or go to Frys and get a frozen pizza it will be better than this"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza at 2:26pm today (Saturday). We were quoted 40-50 min.... 70 min later still waiting and no sign of pizza.

Update: Called the store was told driver would be here any minute but little other info. He ended up showing up at 1 hour 15 min. 

Disappointed... we have ordered from here before and liked it...."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza here on a whim while waiting on my laundry to get washed. Very well priced... Got a 14\" veggie pizza with breadsticks & two drinks for just under $20. The pizza was good... But what really impressed me were the breadsticks. They were AMAZING!!! They come with a marinara dipping sauce & I am usually a sauce fanatic... But these babies were delicious enough to munch on without since they come with an herb butter sauce drizzled on top. Took the pizza to go so really can't speak for the dining room portion."}
{"text":"Been at this location for a while now and the food quality is back up to par.  Love the pizza here more than anywhere else.  Lots of different televisions with a lot of different channels going at once."}
{"text":"So tasty...the ranch is yummy! One day I will conquer the pizza challenge!"}
{"text":"Just, yes.  
Great service, lots of T.V.s  for sports, excellent pizza and wings, and a large selection of other menu items.  Everything we've had here has been top-notch.  The Philly Cheesesteak is savory and tender, the burgers are big and juicy, and the salads are fresh.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"Amazing wings! Pizza is pretty good too. Staff needs to be more attentive to customers - be persistent in getting your food quick"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. Great happy hour, and great service! Super chill usually stop by after work with my husband and daughter."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Couldn't even make it past the phone ordering because apparently they change their Crossroads of delivery to whatever is convenient for them that day. Also extremely rude. Can't believe they managed to get a job in customer service. That goes for the lady who answered the phone and the manager, girl on the phone was told certain Crossroads by her manager, and then when the manager got on the phone told me different Crossroads even though I could clearly hear what she said to get employee in the background 1st. On top of it, after they told me I was too far from their delivery range, they quoted streets that were even further than me as their max delivery range. If you can't even tell your employee the same Crossroads twice, then you quote me arrange further than where I live, you need to evaluate your ability to manage this store. When a place has that crappy of management, it makes sense why the people answering the phone are trained the way they are."}
{"text":"Came here with family after a baseball tournament by chance (after every other place on Bell Rd had 90 minute wait for large parties).  Our starving group of 15-20 was seated immediately & the service couldn't have been better!  The menu is overwhelming - they make everything you could think of! Pizza, wings, pasta salad and garlic bread were excellent! 

Couldn't wait to go back with my pizza connoisseur friends... Went back tonight and it was better than the first time! NY style Pizza was perfect & best calzone I have ever had!! 

Worth the drive from downtown Phoenix! 

I seriously think it's even better than Red Devil 

Extras: tall mugs & great draft selection"}
{"text":"The pizza was okay.. We ordered a large and there was nothing great about it. The customer service (phone) was great though and for under 9 bucks you kinda can't beat it."}
{"text":"Worth It- I live close, and have passed this spot dozens of times. 8 high quality flat screens have football, baseball and Fox 12 on alternating screens. 2 specialty pizzas and a large pitcher for $32.00. Great spot."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that I have eaten from Il Primo before, but we just got their $5 large cheese pizzas for delivery. They were much superior to the chain restaurants in that regard. 

We just left the restaurant from our first dine in experience. 

EVERYTHING. WAS. PHENOMENAL. 

My wife's friend had the spinach and artichoke dip and it was good. Very cheesy. 

We had the breadsticks that were incredible. 

Wife had Buffalo wings that were cooked right and the sauce was spicy and delicious. 

I had the honey hot wings which were JUST right. Not so hot individually that your face was burning after one, but definitely spicy (good building heat) and the honey was just the right amount of sweetness to cut through. 

We all tried different sandwiches. Wife's friend had the Caprese, which she said was great because of the fresh mozz and balsamic glaze. Wife had the chicken Caesar wrap, which she said was awesome. 

I had the Chicken Parm baked sub, which was STUPID good. Like a Chicken Parm calzone, basically. The Chicken Parm was definitely fresh, not frozen and delicious. 

Megan was a great server also. She took care of our table very well. 

Overall, I'm just sad that I haven't been here before. Everything was great. We will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"This was the first pizza place we tried when we moved here from Buffalo. (Food is NEVER the same as home.) We expected to be disappointed, but we were pleasantly surprised! The only reason we don't continue to order from here is that I've since had to go gluten free and I haven't seen that option on their menu. The service was always fast and delicious."}
{"text":"Our children grew up going to Il primos as a special treat and it was a place we took out-of-town guests to as a \"must have.\" Not any more! 

The establishment moved locations a few months ago and they are now at 67th ave and bell road. They changed their menu, adding a full restaurant menu and unfortunately traded fantastic pizza for flat screen TV's. 

Their extra large pizza lost a few inches in size and what was once cheesy and delicious, is now flat and average. 

The two stars are for their wings. They kept those pretty yummy. 

Trying to decide whether or not to return. Sad day..."}
{"text":"Il Primo is aight. The food is nothing crazy special; however, the service was awesome.  Brittany was friendly, helpful, and an overall great server. We had a large group, for which they are definitely well-equipped. The outdoor patio is a plus, and they have large heaters outside, if it a bit chillz outside.  Our group had about 10-11 of us in it.  Five of us ordered food to share--two large cheese pizzas and 10 honey hot wings.  The pizzas were actually pretty small in comparison to other pizza place's larges.  Like I said, they were aight, taste-wise, but they were not making my tastebuds explode in happiness. We ended up having to order another pizza because the gents in our five person squad were not satisfied after we went through the first two pizzas. 

Here's the deal, though; the food is inexpensive and better than what you would get at, like, Peter Piper, and the service was pretty rad....soooo that means you get three stars, Il Primo.  If you are looking for something that works for a big group and is pretty inexpensive, then hit up this place.  If you're looking for better pizza at a slightly higher price, you might want to keep driving."}
{"text":"A nice, chill pizza parlor I like to watch games in. $2.50 domestic pints at all times isn't too shabby, but it's the food here that I enjoy most. Every time I order something, it's so hot I have to let it cool down. Part of me wonders if even a minute goes by between the pizza leaving the oven, and it arriving at my table. 

The lunch special is also decent. I can get two big slices of cheese (the crust isn't too thin or too thick--it's just right!), a couple breadsticks, and a drink for $5. When I'm in the area and have an hour to spare, this is my happy place."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from here since I was a kid. The crust is very good and they are generous with their toppings. I like their sauce as well, it is very flavorful."}
{"text":"This place is rated just about right. Nothing overly fabulous but its a decent pie. This is one step above Peter Piper Pizza and still serves beer. 

Try the cheeseburger pizza its pretty good. The wings are not bad either. 

I am rating solely on food because the service I could easily do without, its not stellar, however if I don't want to deal with it I just order out."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from il Primo for some time now and have always been satisfied, that is until our last order.  We ordered the ChickenParmesan with spaghetti.  In the past my husband and I split the meal, along with a side salad.  The portion of chicken this time was not enough for a toddler.  It probably did not weigh 3 ounces! Needless to say, I went hungry because it was not enough for one, much less to split.

I tried to contact via their website, but I could only leave feedback on a board, using my FB info.  

We will not order from here again...back to Pullano's Pizza at 51st Ave. and Thunderbird."}
{"text":"I love their pizza here and their ranch is home made. The only thing I would change is the girl who answers the phones is very rude but if your can get past that then this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I've heard that Il Primo has great wings, but since I don't eat meat, I can't help you out with that one.  They do, however, have good pizza for relatively good prices.  I always get coupons sent to my house in those stupid blue value-pak things that I end up going through when I'm bored, and I always do find some good deals in them.

Il Primo has 2 large pizzas for $14.99- hey, that's the price of one Papa John's!  And they also usually have some family deal where you can get 2 large pizzas, wings, breadsticks or a 2 liter for $25. 

You can eat in, get take out or have your food delivered too!"}
{"text":"Il Primo probably has the best wings Ive ever had.  I grew up on them and Ive been eating at Il Primo for over 20 years.  

WIngs - excellent.
Pizza - Pretty damn good.
Pricing - a little pricey, but most wing places are
Restaurant - dirty and lame."}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizzas but the service is pretty bad. Had to clear my own table after sitting down. Watched a girl walk by our table twice with a wet towel and she paid no attention to cleaning the table. I had to actually ask another girl if she could get us a towel to wipe off our table. Didn't seem like the girls working there were much of a team. Last but not least. The girl who took our order screwed up our beer order. Asked for an IPA, so she brings out a Kiltlifter. I don't know where the confusion set in."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! Best wings I've had in Phoenix. Definitely recommend if you're tired of fast food pizza places"}
{"text":"Ordered the 30\" Pizza and was not disappointed! Tasty and the price was 30 bucks. The boneless wings were TERRIBLE though! They were small and looked like meatballs. No flavor to boot. Service was strange. Bartender didn't make conversation but sat back and stared instead."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I had our first visit to IL Primo during this past week. The wait staff was friendly and helpful. Food was good. Typically pub food. Nothing to write home about but enjoyable. Atmosphere was a sports bar feel but family friendly. Great happy hour specials. We had a pepperoni pizza, spinach dip, two domestic drafts and a root beer for $21 before tip. Overall, we had fun in this friendly, casual restaurant and enjoyed some good eats. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here on an early Sunday afternoon. The place was empty, but we were a large party of 16, and got seated right away. Sadly, we would ask for items and were told AT LEAST 3 times \"Sorry, we're all out of ...\". How are you out of everything when you just opened and your restaurant is empty? My meal was ok. The servers did not seem to know who ordered what and were giving people someone else's food.  Someone ordered Honey BBQ wings and said that they tasted like they had been reheated.  If you had a dish that required a fork, well you had to request silverware. The servers just did not anticipate the guests needs and had to be prodded for everything.  I had to ask for a salad that I had ordered that never came out with my meal.  If I could give -5 stars I would.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Why does this place have so many poor reviews?  Their pizza is greasy and delicious and their wings are hot and spicy.  Yes, it costs more to get pizza from here than say Pizza Hut but the quality is so much better.  We live down the street from here and have gotten delivery and pick up and they're always quick and have never gotten lost finding our place."}
{"text":"I will never come here again! We asked the server about any beer specials and she told us they didn't have any, while using the restroom we found the specials posted right on the stall! She lied - and after we told her about it she claimed she \"had no idea\" it's your job to know specials! You work there."}
{"text":"This was my very first time at this location and I was craving some pizza and wings. We order our HALF CHEESE HALF PEPPERONI pizza and MILD wings and choose a seat anxiously waiting for our food. Once our name is called we go up and pick up our FULLY pepperoni pizza and hot wings.... ok... I put a smile on and politely tell the woman that I ordered mild wings not hot.. and she proceed to argue with me. Yes, me the paying, tipping customer. I tell her I don't want the hot so she finally takes them back and we wait for mild. (We didn't even tell her about the pizza being pepperoni because we didn't want to cause any more trouble) Our name is called for the wings and we are thinking.. what more can go wrong??? Well they took out the HOT wings and put MILD ones in the SAME sheet as the hot ones... which ultimately got the mild wings hot AGAIN. I look over debating to go tell the woman what happened and I see her eating the food in the back, licking her fingers clean. The same hands used to give me the food. I'm done. Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"You'll feel like you stepped in a time machine and landed in 1987.  The decor hasn't been updated in at least 20 years.  Looks like it's falling apart.  The TVs are mostly 80s style TVs as well, although there are a couple flat screens.  This is where the trash hangs out, of all colors.  The pizza was greasy (which I like) but also chewy (which was gross).  The wings were drowned so much in sauce you couldn't even find them.  Might as well get a glass of honey bbq sauce and drink it straight.  Service was interesting.  The guy that worked there was wearing capri pants and had a higher voice than my girlfriend.  The price wasn't bad- I think it was like $22 for a large pizza, wings and 2 sodas.  I'd rather pay a little bit more and just go to Upper Crust pIzza down the street."}
{"text":"Some of the valley's very best wings for 20 plus years. Everything here is pretty good, but when I'm in a Wings mood, I listen to Band on the Run...then I get chicken here. No, really."}
{"text":"1980's decor is still doing fine here, almost as if they've either taken efforts to preserve it, found retro stuff on ebay, or nobody eats here.  It's truly a gateway back into the 80's.  

Pizza had a good crust, I thought, but sauce and cheese were uninspiring.  Mozz sticks were barely cooked and the accompanying marinara was still cold.  Staff wasn't very friendly, though I can't say rude like some others.  Parking & general area feel a bit seedy too.  Daytime visits only?"}
{"text":"Best pizza this side of New York.. if you're into Chicago style this may not be the place for you, however if New York is more to your liking, then you definitely have to check this place out.. It is not the nicest of locations, and the interior is not a whole lot better.. but when was the last time you went out to a Pizzeria for the ambiance?..."}
