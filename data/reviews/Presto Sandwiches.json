{"text":"Huge fan of these sandwiches. When I'm looking for something quick near my place this is my favorite option. Recommend over the many various chain sandwich places nearby"}
{"text":"Great fancy sandwich joint in an unlikely location.  Because they use lots of things like goat cheese and artichoke hearts and roasted peppers, my boss used to make fun of me for eating here, but he was nonetheless able to find a meat-heavy sandwich he liked just fine.  Their paninis come pressed between the most delicious crusty bread, and the spicy tomato soup really is to die for.  Somehow, it's actually very pleasant to eat here in the summer when they open up the large garage door that takes up their whole front wall.  I think the place used to be some kind of auto shop or gas station, and it's close to the street on busy Lorain Rd., but it's nonetheless airy and clean inside (no car fumes!).  The owners and employees are all really nice.  Stop by when you're out running errands in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Happened across this on a business trip to Glenn Research Center.  Excellent service, delicious sandwiches.  I ha the Chicken Lorain, others in our group ordered the Ham I Am and the Greek Tuna Melt.  Very tasty!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch choice. Sandwiches made to order. Not as fast as Jimmy John's, faster than Potbelly."}
{"text":"Good service, great selection of sandwiches, outstanding soups. The smoothies are tasty."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time a few weeks ago. It's a smaller place but has a great menu. Lots of variety and he staff was nice, but somewhat short and a little too casual hence the reduction of a star off the rating. The sandwiches are fantastic, had one of the vegetarian choices and the bread was thick and tasty and the fillings were flavorful and it wasn't so heavy hat you go into a coma after eating it."}
{"text":"I do a lot of traveling and like to find a sandwich shop close to the hotel that is affordable, comfortable for dining alone and has a good but not overwhelming selection. Of course the food has to be decent. Presto Sandwiches was exactly what I was looking for. I had the Big Mench and it was Excellent!  Presto Sandwiches will be my go to spot when in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Was passing through Cleveland for business and stopped by this sandwich shop because of Yelp reviews and proximity to the airport. Certainly, it is a good sandwich. I had the Greek tuna melt and spicy slaw. The tuna was on a baguette and had plenty of tuna. I think it was \"Greek\" due to the olives and sauce that had a hint of feta. It was good but if you are used to very white tuna, you may be put off by this. The slaw was a generous portion of crunchy cabbage in a dressing with just enough spice.  The place is funky in a good way. It looks like a former gas station. It still has one overhead door. The woman behind the counter was very nice and there were two cute little girls running around that I assume are hers.  One strange thing is a lack of name brand soft drinks but the \"premium\" diet cola was just fine."}
{"text":"Ordered this on Grubhub this afternoon for lunch. Absolutely disgusting food and drink. I got a Chicken & Bleu. It's chunks of fatty chicken on a burnt hot dog bun with onions and a few red peppers. It literally tasted like dirty vegetables. The pop I got expired in July. It's December. It tasted like club soda (it was a diet coke). I spoke to a manager there and was told that I would be reimbursed for the pop but not the sandwich because it sat there for an hour... which is apparently why it was a bunch of fat. Awful rude customer service and disgusting food. Never going to order from Presto again. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"My wife & I went to Cleveland from Buffalo, NY for an overnight stay to visit the R & R Hall of Fame. We had an early lunch & went to the hall of Fame. By 6 PM we were back in our hotel & only then did we realize we didn't bring snacks...plus no room service. We took a walk down Euclid & came across Presto & WOW what great sandwiches! I had the \"Yo Adrian!\"(pepperoni,ham,salami,fresh mozzarella, & normally roasted peppers & onions but I decided not to have them) & my wife had the Elvis Pelvis sandwich(banana, crunchy Peanut Butter,& honey). The man preparing our food seemed to take the time to make sure the quality was perfect. I really loved the flavors of my sandwich as did my wife. We're back home & I'm dying for another already!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place while trying to find lunch.  We ordered the mozzarella tomato salad it was delicious !  My 5 year old got the banana/peanut butter/honey sandwich and gobbled it up!  Great food!"}
{"text":"Presto is a great spot for workweek lunches. Generally, there isnt a line and you can get in and out in under 10 minutes. The sandwiches are fairly original and quite tasty. A regular (slightly bigger than a 6 inch) will run you about 6 bucks and the large (footlong) subs are about 8 bucks. I dine here frequent and usually stick to one or two different subs. The smokin turkey is by far my favorite. The biggest downside is that there is not much room for seating.  Presto is not great, if you want to dine-in with a few people. The biggest table has seating for two."}
{"text":"I want to begin by saying that I ordered this for delivery on Uber eats.   I ordered a \"The Irish\" sandwich, a tomato and mozzarella salad, and a blondie.   The sandwich was delicious! The bread was crisp, there was plenty of corned beef and I really enjoyed it.   My salad was another story. The salad came with slimy, old onions on it. I really enjoyed the Basil sauce that was on the salad, but the balsamic vinaigrette was THICK- thicker than ranch - and tasted spoiled. I at the salad without it. The tomatoes were good and so was the cheese.   Lastly the blonde arrived and was cold like it had been in a fridge or freezer all day. It also is more of a dry cake than the blondie I was expecting."}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland, going through downtown looking for something relatively cheap to eat. It was only one guy there (I think the owner) but it was not very busy. He was kind and nice and the sandwiches were great. My three friends and I all enjoyed our sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is on my way home from work so I figured I'd grab a sandwich and I'm glad I did! The Veg Head is a really interesting combination - artichoke hearts, avocado and goat cheese?! All things I love but interesting to see together! Overall, it was pretty good but not amazing. It was flavorful but I just felt like it fell a little flat somehow. I also got spicy slaw on the side that I didn't love but it wasn't bad or anything. I want to try some of the other sandwiches! Like I said, what I had was good but not amazing.. nothing I'd go back for but the other stuff on the menu sounded good!"}
{"text":"Live in a town long enough, and you'll start finding its hidden gems - those underpriced, overtasty hole-in-the-walls that don't look spectacular, but actually feature way better food than you'd think.    Presto is one of those gems.  You want a sandwich?  You're on this side of town?  Just go here, man.  You need make no further decisions.    The restaurant is in a former auto garage (the window opens up in the summer), and is family staffed by friendly folks.  (The fact that the guy behind the counter looks a little like Viggo Mortenson in History of Violence doesn't hurt, either, if you're into that sort of thing.)    The food is mildly experimental for a sandwich place, with goat cheese and artichokes and other could-be-froo-froo ingredients, but at its heart they're about providing filling, stick-to-your-ribs meals.    They have old standards (roast beef, chicken) for everyone.  And each sandwich is delicious - really nice bread, tasty soup, fresh ingredients.  It's the kind of place where when someone asks, \"What's good?\" you can point randomly at the chalkboard menu and feel 100% assured that it IS good.    If you like the ingredients, you'll like the sandwich.    It is nothing fancy, of course - but if you're a true foodie you don't need fancy, you need tasty.  And it's good to the last crumb, man.    (One warning, though: I asked for a chai.  I got a cup of lava that left my tongue feeling stripped and raw for three days.  Check your coffee before drinking, because you'd think the Human Torch was working that espresso machine.)"}
{"text":"This place is the highlight to the historic arcade it's located in, while still adhering to the old-time vibe that the c1890 building displays.  The people working behind the counter are very nice and I feel like I've stepped back into the 1950s.   I got the beef pastrami sandwich with spicy slaw and chipotle mayo.  Very delicious.  It's not the mile-high pastrami that's more meat than sandwich, but a nicely balanced sandwich that blends the different ingredients beautifully.  At $6 a sandwich made-to-order, it's a good deal."}
{"text":"We were so excited for Presto's opening years ago.  Fresh salads, sandwiches and homemade soup- my dream!  Unfortunately, we have been disappointed time and time again.  The food is just ok, but more importantly the service is very slow, unfriendly and prices are slightly high for the amount of food you receive.  It's too bad because the location is great and the restaurant is so cute, especially in the summer."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since I like to support local food establishments but sadly this place was a disappointment. My first grief is that the fountain soda machine was out not a big deal except the bottled options were only diet coke and ginger ale. The fridge was empty almost and that tells me lack of management. The sandwiches were mediocre but the bread was slightly burnt and that was a bit of a turn off. The sandwiches were not terrible but most definitely not great or worth a trip back."}
{"text":"panini/sandwich shop at the corner of W. 220 and Lorain Rd.  The BEST sandwiches.  I love the Chicken Black & Blue.  The bread is crusty on the outside and chewy inside.  Just enough hot sauce.  The Spicy Tomato Soup is soo yummy.   Check it out, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Really tasty sandwiches, could eat here for lunch everyday"}
{"text":"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised!  I work downtown and have passed this place a million times.  I am not big on sandwiches, so I've never stopped here.  I get my nails done at Marengo Spa in the Old Arcade and decided to stop at Presto's today.  I am SO glad that I did.  I ordered the Turkey Avocado sandwich, there was a little bit of a wait, but that was because I didn't realize tha the sandwich was panini'd.  The bun was soft and grilled to perfection, stuffed with an ample amount of thick sliced turkey, avocado spread, tomatoes and I asked for gouda instead of goat cheese.  I also asked to hold the red onion.   I ordered the small which was a bargain at $5.75 and was a nice size, I can't imagine ordering the large unless I was going to share or save the rest for later.    This was a very good sandwich, toasty, warm and delicious.   I can't believe that I waited this long to try this place and can't wait to return and try other options."}
{"text":"We had no intentions of eating here but since no other places to eat downtown open before 3:00 on Sunday our options were limited. I'm glad we ended up here, the sandwiches were great.  I had the manly....I think. It had pastrami and some killer chipotle mayo. She had the smokin turkey. They were both great. We both got the 8 inch, split a bag a chips and drinks for $17 and left full and happy.  This is for sure not a place for groups or double dates for that matter. There are a couple small 2 seat table and a bar with 4 or so stools.  I will be back here for sure. If you're looking for a sandwich downtown check this place out before you go to the corporate owned shops."}
{"text":"Hidden away in the remnants of The Arcade, Presto is one of the best sandwich shops you can still find downtown. Another one of my go-to lunch joints. It has a local delicatessen feel with vast selection of cleverly-named, fresh sandwiches - unlike your other commercialized options, such as Potbelly, Subway, etc.   My go-to is the Big Mench, a pastrami with Swiss, some slaw and chipotle mayo. It has a little kick to it, but not overbearing. Also the bread they use in this place is amazing.  The people- always super friendly. They usually remember me even if I haven't been there in months. They also have a subway-esque punch card to get a free sandwich, so be sure to pick up one of those, as you will want to go back."}
{"text":"Side salad was described on board - mixed greens = Romaine lettuce.  Disappointed!   Dirty tables, no ice for fountain drinks.  Waisted  our $&&"}
{"text":"I visited Presto after reading all of the great Yelp reviews. Regarding timeliness and taste, Presto is just OK.  There was no line when I visited around lunchtime (score!). I ordered the Smokin' Turkey Sandwich and Chicken Noodle Soup. It took about 10 minutes for my order to be ready (too long!).  The sandwich was decent but the turkey itself was just so-so. The soup, on the other hand, was awful. It tasted like Progresso soup that had been re-heated one too many times.  I'll stick with my old faithful,Potbellys, from now on."}
{"text":"It's as good as I remembered.  Way back when, I had clients out this way and it was a regularlunch spot.  Great panini-style sandwiches, good combinations of ingredients.  Partial to the Big Mensch, with pastrami, spicy cole slaw, Swiss, and chipotle mayo."}
{"text":"Ordered on ubereats. Maybe would have had a better time in the store, but can only speak to my experience.  I would not recommend ordering Presto for delivery.  Ordered Diet Coke. Got regular. Receipt says diet.  Ordered two sandwiches. The photos on the menu all show chips with the sandwiches, which implied that the sandwiches came with chips. Everything was reasonably priced, and I would have happily paid for chips, but didn't order them because the picture implied otherwise. One of the sandwiches, the Veg Head, was supposed to come with artichoke hearts, avocado, tomato, goat cheese, and basil mayo. The avocado was spread thin, like a condiment. If there was cheese, it was imperceptible. It was basically an artichoke and mayonnaise sandwich.  Got two cookies with the order. They were very cold. One of them tasted freezerburned. It was basically garbage.  Generally this was a very unsatisfactory experience.  I'm not completely opposed to giving them another chance, And will update this review accordingly, if my experience is different."}
{"text":"Smokin' Turkey - YUM!   This sandwich shop, located in the Arcade, hits the spot! It's a great place to grab a sandwich and gather with others in the main foyer of the Arcade, or picnic outside. I would agree with others that the seating isn't adequate for a group.    If you're grabbing on the go, I'd recommend you call ahead.  Sandwich, chips and a drink for under $8.00 - sounds good!"}
{"text":"I had a soup and sandwich and the soup was good.  But my veggie sandwich was dripping with grease - butter, whatever it is they slather on their panini sandwiches. Didn't taste too good.   And I guess It didn't occur to them that someone who's ordering a vegetarian sandwich probably isn't looking to take in 20 grams of saturated fat."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Fairview. Their sandwiches are awesome, service is fast and the tomato soup is to die for."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly great! My bf and I like to come here often since we live in the area. I've tried a lot of things on their menu and have never been disappointed. The food takes them kind of a long time to prepare because there's usually only one person working, but it is well worth the wait. The staff is genuinely nice as well and I've noticed they know a lot of the customers that come in there by name. This is definitely my favorite sandwich shop downtown."}
{"text":"We ordered this from work for the first time last week. The sandwich was good, but they messed up my soup order, and since it was ordered out, it was pointless to call them or go back up there for it. Then I tried it again today, really wanting to like it. I ordered their potato soup and the Chicken Cesar Salad. The soup was not even remotely warm and the salad was missing half of what they described on the menu. Needless to say, I will not be returning here. So disappointing because I really wanted to like it!"}
{"text":"When I think \"sandwich,\" I think Presto.  This funky little converted garage of a sandwich shop looks like it should be a simple diner, but the sandwiches are filled with great ingredients.  The bread is excellent, as are the soups.  The staff is exceptionally friendly.  For a quick, delicious lunch, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Ordered the yo Adrian sandwich which came pretty soggy and barely toasted. The sandwich had grill marks but the inside wasn't hot. It came with a pickle which was good. The sandwich was put together pretty sloppily and had the peppers and onions on only the back half. It didn't have much flavor and the texture was just mushy. The worst part was the long hair that I found in both halfs of the sandwich. Won't be going back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Sandwiches nowadays are too trivialized. You stand in some franchise sandwich shop like Subway and you know that nothing out of the ordinary will happen - you forsee that some thinned out ham or roastbeef  soon will be slapped on your generic Italian bread drowned in a dressing from a jar. Blah. Let's dream big kids.  How about authentic intriguing combination of ingredients making your palate and mind wonder about what else is out there? Outside the globe of America? Goat cheese? Pesto?  Gouda? Amazing breads with names that are hard to pronounce? Why not. This little sandwich shop gives you the opportunity to expand the horizons in a very tasty way. All house choices are very good, trust me. Please don't play God creating your own sandwich. Sandwiches like these are like good  movies - you don't go in a movie theater with a script you prepared at home expecting it to be played to you. You come to be amused.  So you might just as well let this sandwich shop surprise  and entertain you. Cheaper than airfare to Europe and  you won't ask for your money back."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. I ordered 2 wraps one for lunch one for dinner. I'll start by saying both wraps were a bit soggy. First was the veg head wrap. Artichoke avocado tomatoes and more. Good but lacking real flavor. The Milan melt was very good!! Don't know why it was so soggy tho. The side salad was well presented and they did include dressing. The dirty chips were good too as were the pickles. All in all will order again.  *** edit: I had to throw away the veg head it was too wet too reheat. Because of this I dropped stars off as well******"}
{"text":"Ducked in to Presto for a quick bite. I ordered the one Vegetarian item on the menu. Its a sandwich called the \"veg head\".  I asked for no cheese and had it vegan. It was good but without the cheese its a little on the light side in terms of ingredients. The bread was tasty and toasted. Overall, this sandwich joint would be better of there were more vegan options.  A vegetable soup would be nice. Overall, I guess Presto is basically good for a meaty lunch."}
{"text":"Great lunchtime sandwich location.  My suggestion is you do the half sandwich and half soup as I feel they have good options for the both and it's the best value."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quick bite and was blown away. I went with the Yo! Adrian, which looked good, but tasted far better. The meat was incredibly fresh and they toasted the whole thing with fresh vegetables and a housemade mayo. I was expecting an ordinary sandwich. I was so wrong.  The owner was incredibly friendly, and we struck up quite a conversation.   The best party though, was the arcade just inside. I took my sandwich on down to the grand hall to enjoy the majestic view of the arched ceiling and exquisite art nouveau ironwork."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches (goat cheese, pesto, yes!),  a little too pricey though to be a lunch time staple."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious sandwiches, definitely a step up from Subway. Delicious soup options."}
{"text":"I would love to round up all the toolboxes standing in the long line just down the street at Jimmy John's every weekday and buy them lunch at Presto. They'd never go back. This place uses fresh ingredients and makes sandwiches to order. My favorites are the Turkey Avocado- no skimping on the avocado here- and the Veg Head, with great big chunks of artichoke and plenty of goat cheese. The tomato/blue cheese soup is excellent (and has a kick) as well.  Seating is very limited, but there are plenty of tables out in the beautiful Arcade.  JJ's fans have no idea what they're missing. Until they find some common sense, I guess that's just more Presto for me."}
{"text":"Presto's makes a good sandwich! The great thing about this place is that they have more ingredients than your run of the mill sandwich shop and they are local.    Now, if you want a standard sandwich you can definitely get that at this shop, but it's a nice change from Potbelly's or Jimmy John's.  I ordered the regular sized \"Warrior\" it was really tasty, but the next time I go I'll have to ask for lettuce and onion - I like my sandwiches to have a little more vegetable to them. :)  If you are in the area - try it out!"}
{"text":"'Give the finger' to all those large, faceless, formulaic national chains!  NO \"hi, i'm Heather, and i'll be your server tonight.  Can I start you off with some drinks?\" parroted here! This unassuming, small, 'mom and pop' corner-stand of a restaurant is a godsend.  That is, if you like world class gourmet sandwiches and subs, tasty sides and soups, and a simple self-serve dining room.  The Greek Tuna Melt (has olives, feta cheese, spices, etc.) was 'to die for', and the tortellini side salad was darn good as well.  2 bellies were satiated for well under twenty bucks!  And all this in quiet Fairview Park, and they have their own parking lot.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Get the Big Mensch. The slaw with the pastrami on their panini pressed bread is so good.  Jimmy is a cool guy, I try to get in there at least once a week.  One of the best places to grab a sandwich downtown."}
{"text":"We were having a working lunch at work. I go to Leman's often and wanted something different. Subway is close but the veg sandwich is boring. Nothing to it. So I tried somewhere new, Presto Sandwiches. Delicious! I got the Veg Head (Artichoke hearts, avocado, tomato, roasted red peppers & onions, goat cheese & basil mayo). Very favorful! It's a cute small place. I took my sandwich to go. I went around 11:30am, no one else was there. I recommend it and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here when I was in Cleveland for a few days.  The place was a little hole in the wall look on the edge of the building.  Overall the turkey and avocado sandwich  I had was pretty decent, but nothing to write home about.  I was hoping for a bit more, like I said, nothing bad, it will get the job done for lunch, but not a must have."}
{"text":"MMMM!! The spicy tomato bisque is DELICIOUS!  I usually get the tomato bisque and the smoked salmon sandwich - so good!  I've also had the Veg Head and the Turkey Avocado sandwiches - also good!  I always order ahead so that it is ready when I get there, but still, the only negative thing about this place is that even when you order ahead, you still may have to stand in line for a while behind everyone else who is ordering in, until you can get up to the register to pay :("}
{"text":"I recently had a Yo! Adrian at Presto with a co-worker.  The sandwich was absolutely delicious.  I love how they use a sandwich press to melt the cheese and heat it up.  The bread was excellent too.  The Yo! Adrian has pepperoni, ham, salami, roasted peppers and onions, fresh mozzarella, and basil mayo.  I loved every bite of it.  This was one of the better sandwiches I had.  I ordered the 8\" and that was the perfect size for lunch.  The kettle cooked potato chips were good too.  I will definitely be back to presto again.  My co-worker said his turkey avocado sandwich was just okay."}
{"text":"I have been to Presto for lunch the past two days. I think these may be some of the best sandwiches available in Cleveland. The Turkey Avocado, the Big Mench (beef pastrami and cole slaw) and the Porky (roasted BBQ pork and coleslaw) are all outstanding. The line has been moving fast lately too, even at 12:05. I have tried both the chicken noodle soup and the chili. Both were extremely satisfying. The chicken noodle used Polish style kluski noodles. The chili was very meaty and hearty. Good bang for the buck. It is $6.50 for a half sandwich and soup combo. One of my favorite places to stop for a nice lunch."}
{"text":"I had seen this spot a few times before I actually stopped.  I ordered two different pressed sandwiches and had them cut in half so that my husband and I could swap halves.  Both sandwiches were great!  This is definitely not your average sandwich shop!  I would definitely stop in again, and I wish I had not waited so long to go in the first place!"}
{"text":"FREE SANDWICHES for EVERYBODY ! ! !   This is located in Fairview Park---not Cleveland---at the intersection of Lorain and W.220, NE corner.   Will tell them so that they can update info here.   5 Star rating is based on the two generously-filled sandwiches that were ordered---and thoroughly enjoyed---and friendly Heather who helped on choice decisions.  BEEF MENCHE * * * * *     (pronounced mench) beef pastrami thinly-sliced, spicy coleslaw, swiss cheese, chipoltle mayo, on hoagie. Very good beef quality...next time---rather than on the sandwich---I'll see if I can have the slaw on the side, instead (even if a slight upcharge for quantity increase, that's ok)...wanted more because liked the taste...each element has nice flavors, however seems to work against each other, with the individual flavors getting lost; slaw on side would make a big difference...still very good, and on a fresh crusty (soft inside) hoagie, panini-prepped...crisp dill pickle  CHICKEN LORAIN * * * * * grilled chicken breast medium-sliced, artichoke chunks, goat cheese, tomato slices, basil mayo, on hoagie.   Very good chicken flavor...this is a popular choice here, and I can see why...a real winner---great combo of ingredients...same delicious hoagie and pickle as Beef Menche   . First time there and will definitely be back.  Very friendly greeting and service.  Several salad choices, and probably 8-10 different multi-ingredient sandwiches (on your choice of hoagie or tomato basil pita---or maybe it was flatbread?).  Soup and potato chips, too.  Clean interior.  Chalkboard-style menu.  Seating for maybe 10-12.  Adequate private lot parking, access from Lorain or W.220.    On a wall about 4 or 5 framed news articles with accolades for this cute little diner, including the Plain Dealer, and (I think) Cleveland magazine.  ******* FREE SANDWICH *******   If they get busy and it slips their mind, ask for one of their business cards.  On the reverse it has 6 blank squares that they will check off/sign.  Once you've purchased 6 sandwiches, the 7th is free.  (Check with them---it might apply to their salads, too.)   Very good value, considering the size and weight ! ."}
{"text":"I came here on lunch break with a group from work. Wasn't expecting much but boy was I surprised! I had a half sandwich and cup of soup.  Tomato avocado sandwich- nicely spiced with crispy-soft bread and great texture with the avocado.  Spicy tomato soup with bleu cheese was velvety and creamy. Delicious flavor. I could order a gallon of that stuff.  Everyone I was with also seemed to really enjoy their sandwiches. Service was relatively fast. Place was clean inside.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is YUM! I finally checked it out yesterday for lunch- i was craving some soup and a sandwich and was going to walk across the street to potbelly, but noticed presto was open so decided I'd try something new.   I got the half and half combo. I picked the Veg Head sandwich (artichokes, tomatoes, onions, peppers, avocado, and basil mayo - comes with goat cheese, but I asked for pepperjack - and then it's toasted). And, I got the spicy tomato bisque. Both were DELISH! I HIGHLY recommend the soup - super creamy and has a kick. Also has chunks of blue cheese mixed into in it. And, more than enough food for lunch! For $6.50, it's definitely a good deal. The half sandwich was about 6 inches and the soup comes in a small bowl.   I went on a Saturday, so there was a couple there before me and a guy who came later. There was only one guy working so it was a bit slow, but I'm sure it's quicker and busier during the week. They have the spicy tomato bisque daily and have additional daily specials on soup. Can't wait to try some of their other ones!   I'll definitely be coming back- so convenient, open 7 days a week, and lunch for less than $7 = awesome."}
