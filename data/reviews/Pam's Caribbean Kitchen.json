{"text":"DEFF one of the best roti's in the city. The jerk chicken roti is amazing and Jerk done right! Not too spicy but SUPER flavourful which is good because to much spice hurts my tummy :S Yes it does take a while for your food to be ready but that's why I call ahead. Very pleasant staff, and great food gets Pam's a 5"}
{"text":"This roti place was extremely slow, overpriced and not worth it. I will not return. My boyfriend and I both ordered roti's (one jerk chicken and one veggie) for 10+ dollars each and did not receive a salad or an order of rice. We also had to wait over half an hour. I am not impressed, nor will I return."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Pam's since 2005, and have eaten at most of the Roti restaurants in the downtown area, but Pam's is my favourite. I've never had a bad meal here and Pam herself is lovely, and I find it shocking that other people on Yelp have said she was rude to them, as I always feel welcome when eating there.

The food here is always fresh, hot and delicious, which is why you usually have to wait a bit to get your roti as they make it fresh for you. My usual order is the boneless chicken roti, the roti bread has a nice texture and the chicken is cleaned well (no nasty bits of gristle, etc). They have great vegetarian rotis as well, which I order when I'm not in the mood to eat meat, usually I get the channa (chickpea) and potato roti . I also like the veggie pakoras with chutney and the homemade pepper sauce is great if you like it hot and spicy."}
{"text":"I visit this place weekly. Very tasty. Everyone I bring to the place loves it too. Chicken roti sooooo good. The hot sauce is HOT!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad Roti at Pams Roti. I always have a delicious Roti at Pams and I love going there for my dinner."}
{"text":"Best Roti Ive had in the city thus far.  Its SPICEY!!!  definitely will clear out your sinuses and your sweat glands.  I'll always go back.  Had the pakora, and the Jerk Chicken Roti, was super yummy"}
{"text":"This place is my \"go-to\" when cooking for yourself seems like too much work.  Definitely the best roti I've had in the city - yeah, they are not all that cheap, but OMG - they are GOOD!  And BIG!  My recommendation is to call ahead first and order - it does take a good 20 minutes to get your order, but most definitely worth the wait.  My fave is the curry chicken roti.  Nice and friendly service - you most definitely won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Have to second the bad review below about this place.  Biggest turn off was Pam herself.   Acted as though we had committed some type of terrible crime by walking into her establishment, being friendly, and ordering 2 roti's to go -  shame on us for doing such an awful thing!!!!

Her complete distain for our patronage carried over into the food - the two tinyest and least filled roti's this city has ever seen.  What a load of crap!  Not surprised to hear her last location was a dismal failure, seems she hasn't figured out the classic rule of business:  if you make a point of treating people like s#$t, and then provide them a crap product, they will not come back ever again.

Here's a mini roti heirarchy:

A level - Vena's (fantastic)
B level - Island thyme (very solid and with a lower price than most)
C level - Jerk King (what they lack in freshness, they make up for in quantity)
F level - Pam's (small boring roti, high price, nasty service)"}
{"text":"Amazing veggie roti.  Best i've had  .  I get the pumpkin, spinach, potato.  so good .  the reason for not giving it a perfect score is the service is dead slow.  Expect to wait up to 45 minutes even if you order in advance."}
{"text":"I like this place. The inside is a little dreary for me considering the walls are lime green and there are paintings of toucans and tropical beaches; I always enjoy take-out more.

Orders take 8-10 minutes to come out and the roti is satisfying. A solid choice if you're in the mood and friendly people inside."}
{"text":"Roti is amazing. I had the Jerk Chicken one. Restaurant is slow, but worth the wait. The owner should fire the skinny waitress, I haven't seen her smiling once and she didn't even say \"Thank you\". She's extremely rude and clearly not happy of doing her job. Give the job to someone else who will love it, not hate it."}
{"text":"My friend and I were at Cardinal Skate shop the other night.  On our way there, we both had a craving for roti and happened to mention it to the store owner.  She was like \"oh, you're going to Pam's?\"  It's very close to the shop and the one that had caught our eye on our way there.  

So once we were done at Cardinal (very cool shop, and the store owner husband/wife team are super helpful!) we walked over to Pam's.  My friend is veggie and I'm very veggie friendly.  She got the channa with okra and spinach roti...I got the channa with cauliflower and spinach.  Both were DEEE-LICIOUS!  We asked for extra spicy and my friend had the great idea of getting some extra hot sauce on the side!  It's homemade and absolute perfection!  

We took our rotis to Christie Pitts and parked it on a bench and had at our roti goodness.  Yes, it's a messy thing to eat...but if you take small bites (hard to do since it's so freaking awesome), then  you'll be find and mess free.  If you have the space (and the patience), I find eating it with a knife & fork helps with the mess factor and actually allows you to savor each bite even more.

If you're in the Bloor & Ossington area...do yourself a favor.  Go to Pam's.  It's amazing!

Bon Appetito!"}
{"text":"I got take out from Pam's yesterday for dinner and was looking forward to it as I've wanted to try Pam's for quite some time now! 

I got the jerk chicken roti - I liked it, but have had better. Was so big I had to share half of it with my boyfriend and we were both stuffed. Nice level of spiciness, and I like spicy. I also really enjoyed the habanero sauce on the side. The only problem was strangely I found 2 fish bones in my chicken roti?! WTF.

I want to try another roti, but I think I'll stick with vegetarian next time.

My other friends got the ox tail plate and the jerk chicken plate - the rice is a little bland but the sauce that each meat came in was DELICIOUS. I think the dinner plates might be the way to go.

Gonna give you another go Pam, hope you don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Pam's is back and that fact alone says something.  It is rare for a restaurant to survive MULTIPLE location swaps within a few blocks of each other.  The reason the place persists is the food.  This is some of the finest Caribbean cooking in the city.  

The roti is the thing to get here and Pam's do not disappoint.  The curry chicken and butter chicken varieties are both superb. All the chicken here is boneless and I've found it to be of a higher quality than many other similar establishments.  There are many veggie options and they are willing to put together pretty much whatever you want however you may want it.  One of the major positives of Pam's is that she will serve you a $4.99 lunch special - boneless chicken curry, pineapple chicken, or curry goat with rice and peas ALL DAY LONG.  None of that \"Sorry, it's 1:03 you missed the lunch special\" crap here! Yeah - I'm talking about you Jerk King! 

While I'm pretty sure that no one has EVER referred to Pam as \"your genial hostess\" I'm a bit surprised at some of the knocks against her in some reviews.   Lack of warm and fuzzies aside, I have found this place to be among the most accommodating when it comes to special orders and off the menu.  Of course, all of that customization comes at a price.  In this case the price is speed.  Orders come at two speeds here; slow and glacial.  

So, if you like good Caribbean food and you've got time and you don't mind that the proprietor is NOT based on a Disney character - give Pam's a try.  It's worth the wait..."}
{"text":"Do not go this this place if you're in a rush.  I waited quite a while for my food but that didn't bother me too much as i'm willing to wait (within reason of course) for good food.  I got the curry goat with rice and beans and it also came with a small salad.  I have to admit that it didn't look very appetizing when it arrived but the goat was nicely tender and spiced well (the hot sauce did improve it though IMO).  The rice and beans were also well cooked and everything came to my table piping hot which was nice."}
{"text":"This Roti was amazing. Had the Jerk Chicken style. Came with a nice little salad and the portion was huge! The cook and I had also had a conversation about cults in South America, very random. 

Anyway, the Roti was nice and moist, good texture with just the right amount of heat. It was not a quick meal but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Pam's Back!
We've been eating Pam's Roti for years, and we were disappointed when her last move didn't work out. But now she's back, and right across the street from us at 912 Bloor St. This could be dangerous.

What I love is that they let you combine ingredients in any way you want, you don't have to just go by the menu. Nothing is pre-made here, which is likely why it takes SO LONG! Try to call ahead if you know what you want. Her new number is 416-533-3588.

My favourite: chick pea, potato and spinach. And her doubles are insanely yummy too!

I'm sorry that Monnie G had such a negative experience. My husband and I are both super pale whities, and she's never been anything but kind to us. I encourage you to give it another chance!"}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here. Beautiful fall-off-the-bone jerk chicken, rice and peas, and coleslaw for $4.99. Best deal in town, and delicious to boot! Make sure to try it with the hot sauce."}
{"text":"We ordered the jerk chicken and curry chicken roti. Our order was ready within 15 mins. Portion sizes are generous for the price and both meals were delicious. Service was friendly and efficient. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the curry chicken roti. It was moist, piping hot, and fresh. The downfall is no lunch special sign and super slow service. It was very good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Fresh, filling, and tasty! My husband and I each ordered a roti: the goat and the jerk chicken (boneless). Both were piping hot and incredibly delish! The service is a bit slow, but the food is definitely well worth the wait. Rotis were about $9.50 each and come with a small side salad - yum!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area at around 3 pm on a Saturday... we parked outside by happenstance and noticed the place was packed - unusual we felt for this time in the day. We decided to go in and check it out. So happy we did! We ordered Rice and Peas and the Jerk Chicken Roti. It was amazing, some of the best Roti we've ever tried. Pam, the owner is Guyanese, and she is super cute and friendly. As we were sitting at the table, people kept ordering the \"doubles\" off the menu. We had to try as they seemed to be a hit. Amazing!! We left with the intention of telling everyone we know about how great this place is. Happy Eating. :)"}
{"text":"Best Roti in town. The vegetarian dishes options are amazing. Try the Okra/Squash/Channa combo
."}
{"text":"PAM'S IS AMAZING! 
We (my boyfriend and I)  regularly grab roti and doubles from Pam's! We usually call ahead and then run down and get them! We never have to wait to long and it's consistently great!!
 *WARNING the hot sauce is HOT!"}
{"text":"Best roti I've tried in the city. The wrap itself is spongy, flavourful and very fresh tasting. Every roti I've had so far has impressed me. They aren't overly spicy, so it's a great option if you want to introduce someone who doesn't really like spicy food to Caribbean food. For example, my girlfriend doesn't like things that are overly spicy, and the owner (who was very friendly) assured her that she would be able to handle it. She was skeptical about eating there at first, but his great customer service and reassurance turned her into a big fan. 

Pro tip: get the coleslaw, and place a little bit of it on every bite of your roti. I had it for the first time when I went last week, and it made my roti just that much better. The sweetness of the coleslaw is a great contrast to the salt and other spices in the roti. 

Another great option for takeout on Bloor West!"}
{"text":"This place is slow.  Be prepared to wait or call ahead for take-out.  
But it is worth the wait for the deliciousness that is Pam's roti.
I always get the veggie roti with a potato/channa mixed base, spinach and squash and I always get mild as I personally  find it spicy enough.  It's always delicious and super filling."}
{"text":"The place was empty when I got there around 1pm on a weekday, hmm.

At $15 for a takeout roti (word of warning it does not come in a take tray/box) very small order of coleslaw and a pineapple pop it did not ring the top bell on the value scale. The medium spice was much closer to mild so have no fear of being burned-out it was perhaps a 3.5. The coleslaw, that I ordered to temper what I thought was going to a little fire, was a watery 2.5. 

I do long for the late 80's and early 90's chicken-roti-heaven of \"The Real Jerk\" in an old bank building at the southeast corner Broadview and Queen. Nothing has come close for me in decades:("}
{"text":"Roti had a lot of potato and not very much chicken. Flavor was solid. Man behind the counter was rude to the person in front of me when he accidentally entered his PIN wrong. For a better roti and service, check out Jerk Spot on Baldwin. I would only come back here out of pure geographical convenience."}
{"text":"Best roti in the city. The roti is always super fresh and never dry which I've found with lots of other roti places. Add veggies to your chicken roti - I like spinach."}
{"text":"Pam's Roti
Great food and friendly service. Pam is super nice and always letting us try new things she has in the kitchen. 
If you want some great Roti and are in the area, pay her a visit."}
{"text":"Easy 5 stars. Tasty curry roti, comes with salad, all types of roti cost the same, nice place"}
{"text":"delicious, couldnt leave the place for a week. have to say as well that im irish and as white as they come and she was lovely, perhaps she was a judge of character and not skin colour."}
{"text":"Food ***
Service ***
Ambiance *

Great spot and the wraps are good.  If you're looking for 'true' jerk, this wouldn't be the space, however the roti is good and the chicken is relatively tasty.

The owners are really nice people too!"}
