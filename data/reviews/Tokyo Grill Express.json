It's unfortunate that someone reviewed 1 star due to misinformation. Went to this establishment but hesitated at the door since I noticed it was a little less than 5 minutes till closing; but a gentleman (Rod) came rushing out and invited me in! Talk about customer satisfaction! Ordered the Ribeye (medium well) dinner with fried rice and vegetables, cooked to PERFECTION. Enjoyed a nice conversation with the workers while waiting for my dinner. I will definitely be coming back to try other menu items. Most establishments wouldn't have bothered to welcome customers in right at closing, THAT deserves 5 stars on its own :)"}
{"text":"Chicken teppanyaki is delicious! Sushi burrito was big and tasty! Shrimp with broccoli is great too. Very friendly people."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good!!! Decently worth every penny and I am a hard person  to please when it comes to Asian food  #yumyumsauce"}
{"text":"First time here... Service was great, employees were very friendly, and food was so good! I thought the food was more flavorful as compared to other overpriced tappenyaki restaurants. I highly recommend this place for some good tappenyaki!"}
{"text":"Absolutly love this place. Now you order at the counter, its a mom and pop operation and they pay excellent attention to detail. I had arguably the most boring item on the menu, due to workout diet restrictions, the chicken teriyaki and it was delicous. Try the sesmoseed salad dressing. And for ten bucks pretty solid meal for the money. Next time i go back im trying the filet"}
{"text":"I met the owner of this place at Osaka and he told me he was opening Tokyo grill express so I had to come see him.. Great food at and great price! I'd highly recommend this place for any of you Japanese fans"}
{"text":"Only been once, but so far so good.

The sushi burrito is H U G E .... Way too much for me to eat, and not the sort of thing that you want to put in your car for leftovers. I felt bad throwing so much away. Split one with a friend.

That being said; I did not *love* the burrito.
It was too 'wet' - and while there was a decent amount of fish, I could hardly taste it over the sauces. Also, being so big and so wet, it was not easy to eat.

The menu here looks great, and I think that there is tons of potential for good food at a good price. Even though this wasn't a mind-blowing visit, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp teppanyaki for lunch. I don't usually spend over $10 for lunch but the plate portion was big with plenty of veggies, fried rice, and shrimp. Made with a flat high temperature flat grill like Benihana style grilling. Food was very good. Also the small salad had an excellent tasting dressing."}
{"text":"Great food at a very affordable price. The owner is a skilled hibachi chef, so he knows his craft!"}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego and the kids were in the mood for teppanyaki. This place showed up on Yelp so...we decided to give it a try. 
A GREAT FIND!
The salad was nice and crisp and the dressing for the salad was so delicious! I ordered the scallops and was very pleased. It was unfortunate for the previous commenter on their \"bloating\" experience but mine turned out exactly how my favorite Japanese restaurant would have prepared it. The whole family ( eight of us) ordered everything from California roll to filet mignon and everyone was a happy camper! 
My only regret is that I forgot to take pictures of all the food. 
Time to add this to my favorites for next time!"}
{"text":"New Teppanyaki style joint, but here you get your food straight up and quick none of the gimmicky demo stuff. The rib eye plate ordered was served in weighted portions, and came with choice of fried or white rice (and lots of it!), veggies and soup or salad.  Everything tasted great! No issues of greasy food or heartburn here. Everything was made to order.

Chef \"George/Jorge\"  knows his stuff, and is pretty hilarious! (a trait of demo chefs) The staff is super friendly. They all have past experience from Benihana, Osaka and Sushi Fever. Always good to see someone branch out and start their own biz. Cool to read and see my fellow Yelpers coming to support new locally owned and operated businesses, and not quick to trash them... SMH. 

It's fast causal, nothing fancy, and the prices are right! They also do delivery in the immediate area. So if you're feelin teriyaki, go for it!"}
{"text":"Such tasty food! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who love Japanese food. They have Hibachi type of food except it's so much cheaper! They also have ice cream tempura & Mochi ice cream. Make sure you leave room for that, it's delicious! This place is so worth it :)"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Guys were interesting to talk to.  Found out lots of information.  Had the Yum Yum Sushi Roll.  And Chicken Rice Bowl.   They even gave me a small bowl of Miso Soup.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"I love this little spot.

The food tastes just like teppanyaki but about half the price.

Super fresh and flavorful and they whip it up right in front of you.

The people that work here are the absolute sweetest. Super friendly and fun environment. 

Also it is VERY clean in here. Floors, tables, and bathrooms are spotless. 

I always get the chicken entree. It comes with wok grilled chicken, fried rice, and a salad for only $8.95! 

They also have steak (3 cuts), sea bass, salmon, shrimp, scallops, and vegetarian options. 

Everytime I'm in this hood I stop in. You should too!"}
{"text":"Great, authentic, Fresh teppan at a fraction of the cost as every other place! 
Teppan to go. I'm in!
All the steaks are great!  Sea bass is great! Chicken is definitely a win and like 8$.. 
service and staff are awesome! 
Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing love thier food and thier staff every one is always happy excellent customer service I come here every payday as my treat defiantly one of my favorite sushi places, did I mention thier food and staff are amazing"}
{"text":"Food is really good,flavor is great i ve been there like 4 or 5 times already i keep going back every time am very satisfied"}
{"text":"Delicious! Got this delivered to my office. They're apparently less than a mile away and took an hour to get here. 1 Hour delivery is within reason, but expected that to be a little faster since they're so close. 

Ordered the Philly Roll, Tiger Roll and Yum Yum. All delicious. Quality of the rice was great."}
{"text":"I came here because Yelp tagged it under hot and new. One of the reviews read \"better than Benihana\" or something along those lines. It's all true. The food was amazing and the customer service was fantastic. I chose to do the New York steak and mushrooms with fried rice and miso soup included. It was authentic teppanyaki, better than the big name places! One of the cooks (and possibly owner) used to cook at one of those big name places (not telling you which). 

Now if you're a fancy plate-and-setting snob and want to see a show, this place isn't for you. The food is amazing, the service is quick, and the price is cheap. If you want the show or bento plate looking things, you can pay the extra 20 bucks for Benihana or Osaka. I'm definitely coming back and telling my friends about this place."}
{"text":"Live by here & tried them for lunch. Scallops were drenched in oil & under cooked. I have had scallops over cooked hundreds of times, sadly, because they get rubbery. I'd rather they were under cooked & if they are sushi grade scallops, nbd. BUT, they weren't fresh. I was actually afraid to eat them. Expensive lunch to inedible. Threw my lunch away & doubt I'd go back. The staff was very nice though, even though they didn't ask why I didn't eat my meal.
Food 1 star
Service 2 stars
Ambiance 1 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and got 1 chicken and 1 NY strip. The online ordering process was easy but the confirmation was confusing it had contradictory information. Food arrived early and it was still hot. The salads were good, but could have had more dressing.  The meal was more than plenty, I saved 1/4 of mine for later. Deep flavor in the veggies and meat, rice was just ok. The dipping sauces were good but they only gave us what I think was one portion so that wasn't enough but the plastic sauce containers weren't even half full so we could have used a lot more. No soy sauce was provided but not a big deal. Napkins and forks were sent with the food. I'll be ordering again for sure."}
{"text":"Great place to satisfied your Japanese craving, great food, clean restaurant and friendly employees, A+ I personally recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious ! Hands down my new favorite Tepanyaki place ! So much better than Osaka . Much better pricing . The staff is amazingly friendly . I recommend Tokyo Grill to any and everyone will be back fo"}
{"text":"The food was good, but I had an informed the restaurant about my food allergy. I clearly stated it in my written order in bold type. After bringing the order home we discovered that it had been ignored. Food allergies can be deadly and should not be looked over."}
{"text":"I was in the area looking for a quick bite, and I saw this place on yelp so I decided to give it a try due to the relatively good ratings. 

This place ain't no Benihana's. No show at your table, but it does its job. The chicken teppanyaki is a steal at $8.95, and it also comes with your choice of soup or salad. The portions are humongous, and it tastes pretty good as well (too much butter though). 

However, the spicy tuna was terrible. I'm not sure if I had a bad batch of tuna or not, but it did not taste fresh, and it had a really funky taste to it. I ate two pieces and threw the rest away. Shortly after, my stomach started to hurt, and then I had the runs. Yikes.

I don't recommend getting their spicy tuna or anything spicy tuna related, but their teppanyaki plates are definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Finally, a fast teppan style place by my side of town!  I used to go on the other side of town for this, but not anymore!

I came at a time when it wasn't busy, so service was fast.  I ordered the ribeye entree, which comes with a bowl of miso soup.  

The miso soup was served super hot and darker and richer than the miso soup I normally get.  Great so far!  

They were very generous with the rice, so it looked as if they skimped on the meat and vegetables, even though they didn't.  There was more than enough meat to fill you up.  The meat was medium rare as I requested, juicy, garlic and super buttery, which is just how I like it!  Grilled veggies (zucchini, carrots, broccoli, and onions) full of flavor as well.

Staff was super friendly.  I think this is a family owned business.  These filipinos can cook!

I'll definitely come back again in the near future!  :)"}
{"text":"Yummm they can get my money anytime! For half the price i can sit at my own table and not have the fancy dancy cooking. I was happy with my meal i will be coming back for more. Staff was very friendly, only down side was they don't have high chairs for babies."}
{"text":"What a GREAT find!  Not only was the food very high quality and completely reasonably priced... The staff was so nice it was practically unreal. They were personable, funny, accommodating and very genuine. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here after reading all the solid 5 star reviews and the picture of scallop dish looked so damn good. 
I was exited to try this place out. Better than Benihana or Osaka?? I'm in!!
As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by this cheerful Asian guy, Rod. The other guy and the lady working here was also very nice with the smile on their faces. 
My scallop entrée came out in less than 5 minutes. Looked nice but not as nice as the picture that was posted on Yelp. After I took a couple of bites, I noticed the scallops and the veggies were drenched in oil. It was almost like floating in oil. Scallops were oily but tasty. Veggies tasted nothing but cheap quality oil, not edible. Brown rice had hard pieces, like they over cooked in microwave. Tasted like old frozen brown rice.
Rod checked on me when I was eating. He was talking to me about Japan (he was stationed in Japan for a year) and gave me 10% discount card for next visit. He was so nice, I didn't say anything about the food. (He smelled like cigarette smoke.)
I only ate the scallops and a little rice, but I felt like I was so bloated. I got major heartburn 10 minutes after I left here. I had to stop in CVS and get Pepto-Bismol. (I hardly ever get heartburn. I can eat 8 pieces of KFC Fried chicken and never got heartburn). I felt grease was coming out from pores on my face (Eww).
I HATE giving low star reviews to nice people...but sorry I have to say the food was disgusting. I would go to Panda one block away from here instead. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow !!!! This food is good, and I love that it is right by my store. Used to have to go so far to get anything decent to eat.

I have tried about 5 different dishes and each and every one was fantastic!  Very nice people running the operation as well."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here with my husband and it was just as good as the first! What brought me back was the fried rice! It's fresh and flavorful! I got the New York steak and it was tender and juicy.The staff is super friendly which is always a plus.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are good. This is definitely a place to come back too!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time. I was extremely satisfied, food was great and the man was super friendly taking our order."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a place like this!! Food was amazing and BETTER than Benihana or Osaka at 1/2 the price. Staff is friendly and the owner welcomed us as soon as we walked in. I will definitely be back as this is easily one of my new Vegas favorites."}
{"text":"Their Teppanyaki menu is good. My favorite is the Ribeye. The meat was cooked perfectly and it came with sautéed mushrooms. It also comes with that same \"Yum Yum\" sauce that you normally get when you go to a hibachi restaurant which made it even better. But I also tried their Sushi Burrito and that was NOT good. First of all (and this is just based off of my choice in food), I do not like cream cheese with my sushi. I usually try to avoid it if I notice it's in the description. But they didn't really display anything that shows a description of the ingredients in their Sushi Burrito so I got it not knowing it came with cream cheese. Once I discovered there was cream cheese, I honestly tried to tough it out hoping it would get better, but no such luck. Their burritos are also slathered with Wasabi which didn't help hide the cream cheese but it hid all the other flavors. After 2 bites, I was done. Eh, at least I tried."}
{"text":"So happy I found them. Such amazing food and there team is amazing as well. So fun and entertaining . I will be back!"}
{"text":"Got salmon Rolls this time can't wait to get home and have them for dinner the place to eat"}
{"text":"Located on the corner of Pecos and Sunset, in the same center as Parsley and Jalisco.  

Tokyo grill offers teppenyaki style food Had to try it! 

The menu offers:
Plates: protein with veggies, fried rice and soup or salad.  And free soda.

Bowls: protein and rice 

And sushi rolls.  

They offered ribeye steak, salmon, shrimp, chicken, NY steak, tofu, etc. 

We ordered the salmon plate and ribeye steak.  The salmon was 6 Oz, nice size Veggies were seasoned well and still crisp."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their food, such amazing mouth watering flavors and great variety to choose from. 

I especially love their tofu dinner & miso soup! The dressing for their salad is also to die for. (Some ginger-like flavor) They also have this new sesame dressing that you have to try that imo surpasses the ginger dressing. 

Their lobster and scallop entree would also have to be another favorite, delicious and unique flavors and texture. 

They also have sushi burritos and poke bowls that are absolutely fresh! The burrito is pretty big, I asked to have mine cut in half. The poke bowl had a sweet with a hint of spicy flavored dressing coating the fish, texture was definitely on point. 

The people running this place go out of their way to make sure your food is to your liking and are always up for small talk, I love people who are personable! I've been here numerous times and will continue to be a usual customer. 

I HIGHLY recommend this place, but don't just take my word for it, try this place out!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and you can't beat the price. Staff is extremely friendly and more than willing to customize an order. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"$11 bucks for a Chicken Entree with tip + tax. This might seem like a lot, but you're served a fairly sized portion. I'd say it's about 1.5x bigger than a normal meal.

I was getting hungry, so I quickly Yelped a restaurant nearby and stumbled upon this place by chance. With my entree, I also got a delicious (very hot - temperature-wise) Miso soup. It was slightly a bit saltier than I'm used to, but it was good! I loved it.

Within minutes, my main entree came. The grilled vegetables were plentiful and good. The chicken was well-seasoned too and I thoroughly enjoyed the fried rice. I really had no complaints. It was a solid meal. It's nothing to rave about, but it wasn't terrible either. I'd say above average as the chicken was pretty good. 

If I'm ever in the area, I wouldn't hesitate to check out this place again."}
