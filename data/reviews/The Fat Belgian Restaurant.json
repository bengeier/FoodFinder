{"text":"I am amending my review to reflect the pricing of their beer. By far, The Fat Belgian charges the most for belgian beer in the city. So much more so, that I have stopped visiting. Go to Cafe Volo or better yet, Sin And Redemption (which is not too far away).

I also want to add that the last couple of times that I did try to visit for a quick drink, I was promptly turned away at the door. Apparently they close at bizarre hours."}
{"text":"Since we had a reservation, the hostess (also the manager/owner?) had saved us a table upstairs, which overlooks the bar on the lower level.  As we walked up and glanced around, it became obvious that this was previously an old residence.  Lots of charm.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy.  

Great beer and cocktail selection, as one would expect from any place Belgian.  The menu also offered several interesting options, including 7 different mussel dishes (all available in small or large).  I started with the soup of the day - something made with apple and bacon.  The consistency was on the thicker side and the flavours were very interesting.  I enjoyed every last drop.  I also ordered the Napoleon mussels (small) which was a surprisingly large order.  The mussels were served piping hot in a delicious sauce with spinach.  The frites reminded me of Belgium, as did the sauce (garlic mayo?).  I tried a bite of the rabbit with risotto - also delicious.

The best part of my experience at the Fat Belgian was the service.  The soup didn't take too long to arrive, but apparently our entrees did.  We didn't realize the delay, but the waitress made a point of coming to our table to apologize and to let us know that the food would be out soon.  She explained that there had been a bit of a rush in the kitchen.  Our food arrived a few minutes later.

After dinner, I was in need of some caffeine.  I asked if they had an espresso machine, and she explained that they usually do, but it was currently being repaired.  Instead, she offered us regular coffee on the house!  I wasn't expecting anything exquisite, but it was actually pretty good.  BONUS:  She also gave us complimentary squares of dark chocolate to apologize for the long wait for our meals earlier.  (For those who know chocolate, it was Cote d'Or, Mignonnette, NOIR de NOIR.)

I was already impressed by the great food and service, thinking at least four stars.  I bumped the Fat Belgian up to definitely five stars when this happened: As we were trying to leave the restaurant, the manager/owner stopped us to apologize for the long wait for our food and insisted we take more chocolates with us!  I never refuse chocolate and was delighted by her offer.  

I am now on a sugar high and thrilled that we found a restaurant that truly cares about their customers.

Also - I think I loved every single song that played while we dined.  I could have stayed there all night just listening to their tunes and enjoying the cozy atmosphere (and eating copious amounts of dark chocolate)."}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday, and arrived around 915pm, reservation was for 9.  The manager proceeded to berate us, saying she cannot allow us in... The restaurant was completely empty.  After saying... \"um its my friends birthday!?\" a couple of times, she agreed.  And later apologized.  Either way terrible introduction.

Mussels and fries were yummy.  So was the beer of course.  Pretty pricey.

Return a second time.  Ordered mussels and beer, mussels were so bad that I had to return them.  Spongy consistentcy, terribly fishy after taste.  And it tasted much different than the first time I ordered them, even though they were the same kind (thai curry I think).

Overall, the manager is abrasive, food is inconsistent.  Price isn't the best.  There's gotta be better."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here but was drawn in by the name. I'm a huge fan of Belgian beers and they have plenty to choose from.  There were about 4 different beers on tap. One of them being Delerium Tremens but it tasted a little dated. I would recommend drinking from their extensive bottle selection. I ended up splitting a bottle of Chimay with my friend.

I glanced at the menu. It looked small but of a good selection of food. Fat Belgian's forte seemed to be mussels. There were about 5 different ways you could order your mussels. 

This place was small but at least two floors and was decorated modernly. I would imagine this is a good happy hour spot or place to talk amongst friends while enjoying some delicious ales and appetizers."}
{"text":"I'm really starting to love this place.  As you descend the front steps you are greeted with a sprawling, well-equipped bar where an always-friendly host is there to help.  The resto resemembles a charming European style home with dark woods and floors on a 45.  The stairs in the back lead you to more seating, sectional benches, and an open-to-below view of the bar.  As for the food and service: flawless.  I loved my moule frites and the braised rabbit with mushroom risotto is a must-try.

Obligatory Title Pun: Your waistline will be BELGIAN.

Menu Readability: Single page divided horizontally in a pleasing ratio; meals on one side, drinks on the other colored inversely.  Thumbs up!

Need to mention: Make a reservation, even if it's not busy.  They'll treat you like royalty.

What this place teaches me about myself:  There's more to Belgium than Tintin and Stella Artois."}
