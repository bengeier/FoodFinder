{"text":"Well... I was hungry and didn't want to drive around to find the restaurant and I didn't feel like to eat Pizza right across from Lahore... I asked some rice with Lamb, Rice was cold and there's no Lamb but lots of sauce. just wasted my money for cold Rice with sauce."}
{"text":"Get the wrap, any kind and it will knock your socks off. The place is open until 8am ( only opens at 5pm )This is the best place for a snack after the bar in the east end. Don't let the decor scare you away! The naan is made fresh in a tandoor right in front of you by a lady who has clearly been doing it for years.  Get the wrap, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Driven by this place numerous times and seen cabbies just pack the place up, so thought it must be good. I judge a South Asian Restaurant based on their Biriyani, and boy did this place flop hard. Their Biriyani was just flavored rice and literally pieces of chicken bone with very little meat. I haven't tried the rest of their food so I can't comment on that but damn was I disappointed. Price wise this place is cheap, so you can't complain about the food, not the best place to sit and eat but better to do take out. I get why the cabbies come here since they make the food fast and it is a quick eat. The staff isn't really helpful unless you speak their language. Only place that sells South Asian food late into the night so that is the only + Stay away from their biriyani, get the wraps I guess as the other posters have mentioned."}
{"text":"Greasy late night eats!  This is not fine dining, folks.  This is \"I'm hungry, tired, no groceries in the house, it's 1am and I need to eat something before passing out\" style eating.   Their chicken tikka masala wrap is tasty and a pretty complete meal.  I've tried some of the veggie sides but keep coming back to the wrap.   Note: Cabbies and towncar drivers from all over Toronto seem to be their primary customer base.  It's not uncommon to see the entire parking lot full of them, particularly late at night."}
{"text":"Came here after hours and found it packed with cabbies! We wanted something warm and filling si we ordered the lamb curry, niyani (the beef curry?), and a few naans. The beef curry really stood out with a punchful of flavor. The lamb curry was really oily, so stay away if you can't stomach the grease. The naans were good, but the seasame variant was definitely one level above the regular naan. Come by if you're looking for something other than pizza or shawramas to quench your late night muchies!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly tasty grub, open late.  It's a great sign in Toronto to find a Pakistani restaurant open at midnight with a parking lot full of cabs. The place is tiny but the menu is extensive and the prices are ridiculously reasonable. I had a great lamb wrap and a nice chana-masala-alike. There was some good looking chicken that my eyes could not fit into my stomach, but it tells me they've got range.  The ambiance is non-existent. The staff is borderline unhelpful. But if you're hungry late and can order clearly, they will feed you with filling and delicious things. When I travel, I tend to trust locals. Here in Toronto, the cabbies are as local as it gets.  Pro-tip: don't ask the staff for help. Be bold, young yelper. Carpe masala."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the place looks like the set of the original \"Texas Chainsaw massacre 1974\"  and thd staff look like \"Oompa Loompas\"The food is a bit expensive, and the joint opens at 6pm!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is typically homestyle fresh and best food providing joint. They have less sitting arrangement but may be some people dont like the ambience. We have ordered chicken salan, mutton allo along seekh kebabs and ofcourse the naan bread. The food at other indian or pakistani style restaurants have no comaprison with this restaurants. They open their restaurant in evening 5pm until 4 am. Just loved this place and the food."}
{"text":"I really like getting the Kebab wrap here. It's quick and inexpensive. This place is open till about 5 am most days as well.  I have tried a few of their other dishes and although they seem to generally be quite oily, really do taste quite good!  Will post a Moses updated review as I try more things.  I did drop two stars - one for cleanliness and one for service. They don't seem to really pay much attention to either."}
