{"text":"While Starbuck's may be on every corner of urban America, it's nice to find a unique coffee house like Weather & Coffee can still exist.  This unique establishment has great coffee, tea, slushes and juices to drink, and has a nice selection of muffins, bagels, and sandwiches to munch."}
{"text":"Really decent coffee - nice, quick service.  They have a drive-through and frequent buyer card.  Too bad about mornings-only hours though.

EDIT - 
CLOSED :("}
{"text":"Great *locally owned* coffee shop!

Ed Phillips, the weather forecaster -- you've seen him on TV & heard him on the radio -- owns AND operates this delightful place to take a break -- or jump on the FREE Wi-Fi and keep workin'.

While you're there, you can check out the weather back where aunt Martha lives, or you can plan your next trip - around - the weather instead of driving thru the weather!

Nice people.  Nice service.  Good stuff to eat & drink.

I just love supporting local businesses -- especially when they are as good as Weather & Coffee!"}
{"text":"Aww, too bad these guys went out of business.  I actually only went there one time, I live in Chandler, so it's just a little out of the way.  But I stopped through the drive-thru and thought if I lived near-by this would be my coffee place.  Whoever took my order that day was very friendly."}
{"text":"Dear Weather & Coffee,

I'm really sorry you had to close.  We had a lot of good times together.  Every time I came in, you always seemed really happy to see me... even though you knew me by the wrong name.  

I may be Kelly to everyone else, but I'll always be Aubrey to you."}
