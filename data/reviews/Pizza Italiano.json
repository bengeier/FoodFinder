{"text":"They really need to step up their Lasagna game. I like the price and presentation but it needs more meat and way less pepper. I'm not sure if they just have a naturally spicy recipe or if it was over-peppered but after 3 bites I couldn't even finish it. Glad I got a backup pizza, which as far as pizza goes was pretty par for the course. Free delivery on skipthedish after $30 so that is pretty sweet too."}
{"text":"Absolutely unprofessional, they open at 10am but have nothing ready. I go later and later and it's like they're just messing with me. Just walked in at 10:45 and there was food from the night before and the guy said he just walked in. They have lost a costumer. The one star is too much for this lack of service."}
