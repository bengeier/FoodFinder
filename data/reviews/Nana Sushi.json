{"text":"Had the PS1 to go platter and it was delicious. Freshly made and the ginger and wasabi were a great compliment. Would definitely recommend it for any sushi lover."}
{"text":"Prices are great, sushi is really good for the price. Super great value. The variety is also amazing for japanese family restaurants with sushi, dons and bentos. They also started serving ramen too so I'll be trying that next. Never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"This place has gotten fairly low ratings, so I came in here assuming that things wouldn't be too good. Glad that I was pleasantly surprised!  That being said, there are a couple things to note upfront: First, they are severely understaffed. Expect to be waiting quite a long while to be served. We literally sat for half an hour without any drinks and without an adequate number of sets of utensils.  Second, if you get the sashimi option, be warned that the rice is NOT meant for human consumption. It was literally wet to the point of being porridge. Not sure why, but I hope chirashi would provide better rice given that the rice there is seasoned.  My dad and I ordered the sashimi set of 16 pieces (with the ugly mushy rice), while my sister and mom got the set with nigiri and spicy salmon rolls.   I was a huge fan of the sashimi options in the set! There was aburi tuna, some slightly seared mackerel, lots of salmon and tuna. None of the cheap tamago or artificial clam stuff. My main complaint would be, as mentioned before, the rice. Blegh.  My Mom and sister also enjoyed their sets. The nigiri options were quite varied, and apparently the spicy salmon roll was pretty good too (though my sister would have preferred less dressing on top)."}
{"text":"Disappointing and Expensive.  We ordered $50 delivery, the hot foods has to the worst ive eaten from any Japanese restaurant. The order was small compared to other delivery sushi Restaurants making it so unaffordable.  My Teriyaki chicken (15.99) was overcooked so heavily, the sauce tasted burnt and super salty, but the vegetables were completly raw. Everything was so carelessly thrown in, the rice had a pool of teriyaki sauce at the buttom.  My friend ordered some sushi combos (8.99) (15.99), once again unaffordable. Salad tossed in carelessly, the only upside is that the sushi was made well.  Seriously 15.99 for a small entree and two small sides in cheap Styrofoam packaging is not a valid price point in Mississauga. Compared to moon sushi with 2 spring rolls 4 sushi teriyaki chicken and miso soup for 11.99.  I would not recommend Nana to anyone. If you are to order, go to Moon Sushi."}
{"text":"just ate at this new place and was quite impressed...had their philadelphia roll, shrimp tempura roll and bulgogi roll....huge pieces of sushi but very fresh and tasty....big selection of maki rolls and definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"It's been a very long while since I've been here but it remains a great place to get very good and very fresh sushi. Service is good too. Recommended!"}
{"text":"This place has really great sushi, both roll and sashimi. The service is excellent and they watch out for if you ever need anything. I especially enjoyed the garden salad. In terms of price, it's about equal to other sushi places but the quality of the food is higher than others. They also serve fairly quickly (although I went during their down-time). I definitely recommend this location to other people."}
{"text":"Tip:  You can catch the free Wifi from Starbucks next-door!  Nana replaced Sushi One, so location-wise, it's pretty central.  Restaurant itself is small-medium sized with about 10 tables, including 4-5 booths.  Good: -  reasonably priced lunch specials 'til 3pm, even available on the weekends -  quiet atmosphere -  no complaints about the quality of the fish -  nigiri is not laden with rice -  prices (are on online menu)  Ok: -  food took a *bit* longer than usual to arrive to the table after ordering -  about 50-60% of the lunch specials comprised of salmon, so some more variety would be nice  No complaints about the service.  It was fine, not super duper friendly.  Salad/soup bowls weren't cleared until after the mains were served, but no biggie tho'.  A solid place for the 'burbs, but if you came here from dt/Markham/RH, you may be a bit disappointed about the variety.  Variety is the only reason my rating was not bumped up to a 4!"}
{"text":"I've tried salmon teriyaki, bulgogi, a tempura bento box and a black dragon roll. All of them were great. This place feels cleaner than when it used to be known as \"Sushi One.\" They don't provide as many side dishes as its former business did but the quality of food seems to be better and well made. I didn't like the side dishes that much anyway.   Starbucks next door has closed, so you won't get free wifi from there. Parking is available in the private lot in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not bad for food quality vs price. Simple restaurant with 10 tables or so. Quiet environment. Could be more attentive in terms of service but they are quick to respond if you flag down the waitress."}
{"text":"Located in a supermarket and other Eatery plaza, so indeed you will have plenty of parking spaces.   The menu was mostly Japanese with some Korean options. Many choices and they have daily roll specials.   Friends like what they ordered. Nothing special to them as they are from east Toronto. They had bulgogi beef, mixed tempura and sashimi platter.   I had two veggie rolls. Nothing stood out. They looked like normal sizes. I would have like it with some sauce on top. I'm not a wasabi type of gal.   Verdict: I would go back to try their lunch specials. Limited seatings so not great for large parties."}
{"text":"So this place replaces Sushi One, which I loved dearly. There's many similarities and some changes as well. The cooked food like the bulgogi and salmon teriyaki tasted just as I remembered it, which is a good thing. The special roll, black dragon, was huge as well and delicious. The inside of the place looks almost the same.  Now, what's different? They now have a roll of the day thing going where a different special roll is at around $10.50 each day. That's actually a great deal because the special rolls are huge. They have also finally fixed the miso soup which was always way too salty, but now finally tastes normal. The salad is the same although I usually like a more sesame-style Japanese dressing.  The changes I don't like as much are there's no banchan anymore (most sushi restaurants don't give banchan anyway) and no complimentary ice cream anymore. Lastly, the prices are a bit higher now. Still, they balance it out with other deals that didn't exist before (take out deals, roll of the day, some changes to the lunch deals)."}
