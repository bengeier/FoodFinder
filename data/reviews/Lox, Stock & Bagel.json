{"text":"Used to love this place. Have a lot of amazing memories here. Grew up with lox being the best place to have breakfast with all our friends. Gonna start having my boyfriend pick up our food. The blonde older lady there is exceptionally rude. She always seems to be messing up my order, and has this look of disgust on her face when I come in. I've always been very sweet to her, but for some reason she doesn't seem to like me one bit. This post isn't about the restaurant in general. It's more about her and her lack of customer service."}
{"text":"This place is close to my office, but I'd never been before. There was a  Groupon offered last week so I thought I'd try it out.  The good: my salt bagel was *actually* salty. Since most places have decided that sprinkling one or two crystals of kosher salt on a bagel is good enough, this made me happy. The service was quick and pleasant and the restaurant was clean and well-kept. Onion, lox, tomato, and cream cheese were all as one would expect.  The bad: yet another fluffy-thing advertising itself as a bagel. My bagel had no chew whatsoever. I get more resistance from an Einstein's bagel.   I'll stick with Chompie's for now."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!!! I'm pregnant and all I've been wanting is a chicken salad bagel from my favorite bagel shop home back easy. This did it for me and I wished I lived closer, I'd never leave!!"}
{"text":"Great bagels Family atmosphere. Keeps us coming back! CD"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have checked out the other local Deli / Bagel Shops in the area. There isn't any that compare when it come to their bagel and bialys. I also really enjoy thier coffee."}
{"text":"Outrageous prices. Bagels are ok. The \"extras\" like cream cheese are obnoxiously priced.  1 croissant and 1 cinnamon roll costs over $5.50. These are the same croissants that sell for about $5 a dozen at Costco. Basically, expect to pay airport or amusement park prices for mediocre fare.  Even though they are less than 1/2 mile from me, I will drive 10 minutes elsewhere to get a bagel."}
{"text":"Just ate here this morning after a long night of drinking and waking up with a hankering for some super delish bagels.  This place is a little far away from my lovely little spot of tempe, but it was nice to find a bagel nosh spot that isn't Einstein Bros.  Walking in, immediately hit with the intoxicating aroma of fresh baked goodies and coffee.  I definitely stood in front of the menu for about 5min trying to figure out my ultimate hunger quenching decision.  Ended up getting the everything bagel with some raspberry cream cheese.  Super toasty and delicious that I inhaled in approximately 5.25 minutes.  I had to get like 5 napkins to wipe away all the excess cream cheese that was all over my face.  It was probably the most attractive way that I've ever eaten a bagel.  To wash everything down I ordered a \"fresh OJ\" which was merely poured from a 2 gallon jug that was obviously not the freshly squeezed nectar that I was expecting to help hydrate and boost my vitamin C for the day.  This place had a lot of old people in it.  Not really my cup of tea, it needed more hipsters.  They have free wi-fi though!!!  So if you've been looking for that new place sit down and get a couple more chapters done on your new teen vamp novel done, you've found your perfect spot!! My overall experience was wonderful and I would recommend if you're one of those foodie bagel types."}
{"text":"The people working here were so sweet and friendly! They were super quick with making my lunch also! My protein salad was huge and delicious! Super fresh.. The dressing tasted homemade. This place is definitely going to be a new favorite for me! They have me 6 free bagels with my check in.. I bought some whipped honey peanut butter to take with me and I am beyond happy! This place made my day!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this bagel place while down south one morning. The salt bagel with peanut butter was great. The perfect amount. Hubby had the blueberry and said the coffee was great. Today I tried the gluten free bagel and it was good. Glad to see the option as the thought of giving up bagels was rough!"}
{"text":"I was overjoyed to find this place.I was stuck in a day long training and was looking for something to eat during my lunch break. Sweet! This place is so friendly and has such  nice vibe. The people who work here, (the owners?) were so nice and they seemed to have a lot of \"regulars\" from what I observed. I don't eat bagels very often, but, I was in definite need of some comfort food after a long morning and the anticipation  of a long afternoon. I ordered an egg and cheddar cheese bagel sandwich on a sesame bagel (I was jazzed I could get the breakfast sandwich at lunchtime) with a garden salad to go. When I got into my car I took a bite of my bagel sandwich........yum!! It was perfect and the best part of my day! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best bagel shop in the Valley.  Family owned, employees who care, and bagels to die for.  There isn't a bagel shop in the Phoenix area that even comes close.  Guess who provides bagels to the top resorts in the area?  You guessed right....Lock Stock & Bagel.  If you like bagels, do yourself a favor and visit this shop....like I have done  every week for the last decade."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 20 years!  The chicken salad is awesome.  I also love the chili and the veggi bagel sandwiches.  You cannot get a better bagel anywhere!  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Since I've posted my first review I've been contacted by the owners, who suggested that possible portion error has occurred and I should had received more lox. They offered complimentary  bagel and lox for my next visit. Well I did not came back to my free bagel yet but I'm changing my rating on this review first, because I appreciate and respect he owners who are not afraid to admit a mistake and also truly care about their business. And second, their bagels are simply delicious and yes lets support small local business and forget about Einstein Bagels :-D"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? Wow very disappointed- we used to enjoy it here. The bagals just did not seem right. No one seemed very happy. I really didn't recognize anyone. I heard over heard someone say they sold the place. I hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"I'm a chicken salad connoisseur... this chicken salad was pretty good! Bagels are awesome and you can taste the difference. Perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"We saw good reviews on yelp and expected some gourmet bagels and good service. However, once we arrived we were rushed to order, it did not look very clean, and the bagel sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches were mediocre for the relatively high price we paid for an egg bagel sandwich. This place is just another bagel joint-I would not recommend ordering anything else. We went out of our way to explore this shop, but we probably would have been better off going to Einsteins."}
{"text":"Update: it seems this establishment has changed ownership. and wow, just wow...in a really bad \"wow\" way. Once a reliable place to grab a quick bagel and coffee, has turned into a complete circus act.  First the new owners arbitrarily increased the pricing across the entire board, literally.  Adding insult to injury, the food quality & service has plummeted while the pricing had gone up. You don't need to be a business consultant to see the problem in that trend.. Anyway, bagel was stale, probably a day-old. Coffee was terrible, again stale. Once proudly served by Michelle and her husband, now it's a bunch of clueless teenagers with the typical bad attitudes. Yup, so now you get overpriced subpar food served by entitled teens. No thanks.  And it's showing, once a popular spot on the weekends is now empty space only filled w a gaggle of gossiping teens doing nothing behind the counter. Great job new owners!"}
{"text":"Having tried many different bagel shops in the Valley I am always looking for  better bagel. I guess I am spoiled having grown up in Brooklyn, the home of the best bagels, just my opinion and actually many others too. I decided to try Lox Stock and Bagel today and was not disappointed. The bagels are tasty and the texture is just right. The toppings on the bagels are generous, some places seem as if they count the sesame seeds. One bagel didn't even make it home. It was my reward for driving to get them. I am now a fan and will be making this the home of my bagels of choice. The early opening, 5:30 AM is also  plus."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Bagel Place in Scottsdale.  The bagels are fresh and perfect, they will even slice them for you if you ask.  Their cream cheese blends are very good as well as their breakfast sandwiches.  Just recently tried their gluten free bagels, and altho they are not made in house, they are really good.  You won't be disappointed if your craving a good bagel or bialy."}
{"text":"Probably the best bagels in Scottsdale. Made in house!  A perfect example of how eating local just tastes better"}
{"text":"Wow-service has really declined! I went into Lox, Stock and Bagel this morning and was the only person in line. I watched 3 people behind the counter make an order rather than wait on the customer right in front of them.  The manager/ owner who was busy doing paperwork  got up and went into the back - and didn't acknowledge the situation either. I ended up walking out with no food. It's really too bad - because Michelle and Michael worked very hard to establish a great business for the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The bagels were average and for what you get REALLY overt priced. I'm not impressed and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"For as expensive as this is, at least they could give you a real cup for coffee vs. styrofoam."}
{"text":"I've had a number of other bagels and today found out that I have been eating garbage. This place has the best bagels I have ever eaten in my life. Lox, Bagel and the Works is delish!! Coffee does not make your hair stand up or make your heart race - tastes great! Service is fast and friendly. Will definitely be back again. Place is small so get there early on weekends. There is seating outside too."}
{"text":"Another great trip to Lox Stock! The bagels and service are the best!"}
{"text":"The BEST bagels in the Valley!!     Always on the lookout for great places to go with kids!"}
{"text":"Bagels were very good, fresh, flavorful. Cream cheese was perfect, very good service. Nice choices of bagels and sides."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best bagels in the valley. The staff is super friendly and they make it a point to make you feel welcome. I've also used them many times to cater lunches for my office. Great food and reasonable prices make this a perfect alternative to ordering pizza. My only suggestion is that they open for dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for mom and pop places like this. Walked in ... Greeted promptly and instantly was told about all the bagels! I looked around there were so many people who seemed like regulars that were just hanging out. I loved the vibe. She asked me why I stopped in and I told her I just started school at Scottsdale cc and she instantly invited me and friends from school to come to her shop and eat bagels and do study groups. And not to mention the bagel I ate!! It was awesome. I usually get nova lox but I saw something about nova lox spread... So I got that. And bc of that spread is why I give 5 stars. Yum!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff, clean establishment and GREAT food. Definitely recommend it and will be back again."}
{"text":"Nothing is prepared fresh here.  I had the egg and cheese onion bagel and my husband had the lox, onion and egg bagel.  What you get here is an Einstein bagel you bought yesterday and nuked for way too long.  For $8.   The eggs on both of our sandwiches were grey, rubbery, and mouth-burning hot.  The bagels were both dry and gummy at the same time.  Coffee was also bad.  Service was slow (Sunday, 8:20am, maybe two other customers there)."}
{"text":"Great place to visit!!!  I am spoiled since it is very convenient to where I live but even if not, I would drive miles to have one of the veggie and/or a tuna melt on their sun dried tomato bagel. I feel welcomed by the staff whether I am dining in and/or taking my order to go!  I recommend them to as many people that I can.  I would have given them \"five stars\" but no vendor is perfect!  Today as I ate my veggie bagel I was wishing I had a tad more veggie cream cheese!"}
{"text":"This review comes after several visits. Everything has always been OK, but not great, especially for the price. In terms of bagels, this place is easily $$ or $$$. So don't go thinking you'll get Einstein's prices for equivalent grub. You'll be disappointed. The lox special is always a let down. At least for us - plenty of bagel real estate, bare of salmon, for $11.  But the lox special is the only thing that doesn't change price. I swear everything else goes up .50 every time we visit. Today, $9.79 for a turkey bagel sandwich (no side or drink). It's always busy, so more power to them, but not really worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Only spot in phoenix that I can find a salt bagel. Staff is great and the coffee is awesome. Good place to sit outside with the doggies too. Only draw back is that it is kind of pricey."}
{"text":"I love everything bagels, and Lox Stock & Bagel  has both a wheat and white everything bagel, which are both to die for.  The store is kind of tucked away in a shopping center, off of Hayden, but it is well worth the bagel shop is well-worth the time searching."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for a good bagel and cup of coffee. I was killing time until golf, so decided to read the newspaper, and have a cup of coffee. Noticed this small bagel shop and thought I would give it a try, and I'm glad I did.  There was a wide variety of bagels - you order it, they prepare it, and bring it to your seat. Since I had ordered just a bagel with cream cheese and was going to sit outside, I thought I would just wait for it.  Nope - they insisted I sit down and they would bring it to me.  Which they did, and fairly promptly too - it just seemed kind of strange.  The bagel was great, coffee was good, and the weather was nice - made a great morning, and I will try it again."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast or a light lunch. Every time I'm in the Scottsdale area I stop here for at least one breakfast or lunch and then buy some bagels for breakfast later in the week. It is a very casual atmosphere with friendly staff. I always get the whole wheat (gluten free) mixed topping bagel. I've never had an \"everything\" bagel taste so good! Unfortunately it is a very popular bagel so if you get there later in the day they might be out as they were today, so I got just the mixed topping bagel for my veggie sandwich. As usual, everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"After 5 years of searching over 3 different states, I have finally found my bagel place. Lox Stock & Bagel really has perfected the bagel sandwich. I ordered an Oreo cookie bagel with cream cheese and lox (yes an extremely bizarre but tasty request). The bagel was delicious! Even after putting the rest in the freezer, they still tasted delicious after being heated up. The owner even gave my roommate the remaining pastries from the previous day for free! She was so kind and extremely helpful. This is the only place in central Scottsdale to get bagels."}
{"text":"I've loved this place since I was little! Other than it being my first job their quality of food has never ever changed. Everything is made fresh every single day. In over 15 years coming here every bagel I've had has been delicious. I always see them involved with the local schools, employing the local high school students and always friendly faces. I love seeing pat and Michelle every morning. Support local business go to Lox Stock!"}
{"text":"Great bagels, great chopped liver and very friendly staff.  Great deli."}
{"text":"Lox Stock is my FAVORITE bagel place ever.  Anywhere.  Hands down.   My favorite bagel is their toasted whole wheat mixed topping (everything) bagel, with their low-fat cream cheese.    On weekends, we don't usually get there until after 10am and sometimes they run out of whole wheat mixed topping bagels...so I have a 2nd favorite: A toasted ooey-gooey cinnamon raisin bagel with blue berry cream cheese.  I know it sounds so odd, but it is SO GOOD!!!    The people who work there know me and are extremely friendly.  This is definitely a great place to grab breakfast or lunch.  I am very lucky to live and work just down the street from Lox Stock!!!!!"}
{"text":"We love lox, stock and bagel. It is a great neighborhood breakfast place. The food prices are slightly high, but I guess you pay a premium for convenience. The bagels and lox are amazing here, but the freshness of the vegetables are hit and miss which is why I give it the 4 star rating. THe side dishes are also mediocre and I wouldn't suggest paying extra for the tuna or egg salad."}
{"text":"Great place to eat breakfast! They have tons of bagel options and breakfast sandwiches :). Also they have a very generous check in offer"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale! Perfect bagel, good breakfast burrito and warm friendly owners!  Always welcoming!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Lox, Stock & Bagel!!!!  The bagels are the best in town, the people are terrific, and its such a great \"local joint\" for meetings.  We do all our committee meetings there.  It's one thing to shop local, but another when you can shop local AND get the best there is."}
{"text":"I am from the east coast so I know my way around a bagel shop. This is literally the  BEST bagel place in Phoenix. Crunchy crust, soft chewy center, toppings piled high. I would go every single weekend if it weren't a bit far. *owners: open a Tempe location please ;)"}
{"text":"We love this place. We live right down the street from Lox and go several times every month. They have great food, great service and great prices. We've noticed that their bagels are bigger than a lot of other places and they definitely put the most meat on the bagel sandwiches compared to any other places we've eaten in the valley. Patrick and Michelle are always extremely nice and they have a great staff. Could not be more pleased."}
{"text":"The only bad thing I can say is...why can't they open one in N. Phoenix where I moved to!? This is the best bagel spot in Phoenix. Hands down. I'm writing this because I went out of my way on my 30th birthday to come here for lunch. Everything is always great. I used to frequent for morning bagels when I lived nearby.   You can't get these kind of bagels at the chain places. These are hand crafted amd clearly made with the love of bagels in mind.   I have had many other things on the menu but have tried many different bagel and schemer combos and even their Oreo Chicolate bagel was amazing! (Not a fan of sweet things that should be savory)   I would recommend this place to anyone for any reason on any day. Gets a little crowded early mornings so be prepared to queue up a bit.   Favorite bagels in AZ. And I've looked abd looked and looked ever since moving from CA."}
{"text":"While I've been coming here off and on for years, and always left pretty satisfied, there are two things that bother me that I want to point out. First is that you can barely read the prices on some of their menu board items. I get it, you change your prices and have to update your menu board on the wall, but it's not easy to read when you put tape over it and then write the new price on it, yet the old price of sort of showing through. I think they just need to invest a little more time and actually work to revise the menu board on the wall so that it is more clear.  But was more concerning is that I ordered a bagel with Lox spread. Basically it should be lox mixed into the cream cheese. The bagel was great, and the cream cheese tasted good, except you wouldn't know there's any lox in it. It had teeny tiny flecks of lox showing but no slightly larger pieces that you expect for the upgrade in the price. Not a big deal, but it would be nice if a few slightly larger scraps made their way into the cream cheese. Just trying to be constructive as I'm not a mean person."}
{"text":"My new favorite bagel place! One morning I was in the mood for a bagel, but didn't want to go to the usual chain restaurant that I live by. Checked yelp and drove a few miles south to check his place out. The food was delicious and the service was amazing. I didn't realize there was a check in deal and when I told the lady I heard about this place on yelp, she reminded me that I get 6 free bagels just for checking in. Uh whattt! Most places never mention their check in deals. Some places even refuse to honor them! 5 stars for the food and service!"}
{"text":"Went here last week for a lox and bagel. I was blown away with how personal and attentive the owner was. She really appreciated our business- which is always a plus.   My lox and bagel was phenomenal. The only thing it lacked was capers, which would be nice. I had it on a sesame bagel which was fresh and soft, in the middle and crispy on top where it was toasted. next time I really want to try the whole wheat mixed.   The Groupon was really nice to get. I'll be back again soon to try more bagels and grab a coffee!"}
{"text":"Word on the streets was was that Lox Stock & Bagel was a really good local breakfast/lunch spot, so when I saw a groupon deal I though I would give it a try.  Upon entering, I was happy to find there was   not a long line, and the inside was larger than I had expected, you can actually sit and have a nice comfortable lunch here.   Unfortunately the groupon for some reason was not working, nor would they honor the deal, but I will let that slide because the service was fast and friendly. There was a large variety of bagels, cream cheeses, and fillings. I opted for the cheddar jalapeno bagel with ham, eggs, and cheese.  It was large, with a good portion of ham, a soft tasty bagel, all put together very neatly so was not difficult to eat.  I was also pleased to find decent hot chocolate here, not too watered down like I find at other places, and I requested it with caramel- YUM YUM YUM.  Had to update to a well deserved 5 stars after trying their breakfast burrito.  Came with eggs, cheese, potatoes, bacon and ham.  It was like I died and went to burrito heaven.  Hands down best breakfast burrito in town."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 5 years when I'm in AZ from Maryland. Best food, nicest staff and just an all around excellent place! Great bagel for breakfast and great sandwiches for lunch!"}
{"text":"The bagels are fresh and tasty.   The sandwiches are well made but seemed a little shy on the meat and cheese.   This place is great and I'd suggest it to anyone.   Side note, the 12 year old girl that took my order over charged me by $3.00. When I told her she looked at me curiously as if she didn't understand what I said and then moved on to the next customer. The meal and dozen bagels I ordered were worth it and the $3.00 let's just say ended up being part of her tip."}
{"text":"When it comes to bagels in Scottsdale it doesn't get much better than lox.  My family and I have probably been going here for the past 14 years.  I am IN LOVE with the veggie cream cheese, nothing else compares!    The staff is all so friendly, and they start to learn your name if there there enough!  The bagels are always fresh and delicious!  They even have really cute holiday baskets around the store!    Wonderful place! I would recommend it to ANYONE!  :)"}
{"text":"Ever since discovering this place i've been obsessed! It's a great weekend spot to get a quick morning bite to eat with friends. The bagels are AMAZING. I usually am pretty unoriginal and get a sesame bagel with herb cream cheese but its just so darn good. The staff is always friendly and I can't wait to go back this weekend. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick and light breakfast with my boyfriend and found this place. The staff are very friendly and they took our order quickly and efficiently.   The breakfast bagels were very good and there was ample seating to eat in the bagel shop.   Overall it was a good experience and we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! So good we went two days in a row last weekend! Don't forget to check in so you can get your free bagels! I love their beggels- I get the egg, bacon and cheddar on Asiago! The sesame bagel is a great choice too! I tried the turkey sandwich on the sesame and highly recommend it with the honey mustard!"}
{"text":"Great bagels, bacon and good coffee.  Awesome location... Great place for a quick wake-up."}
{"text":"I love this place though lately they have been getting my order wrong & assuming on the toppings. Today I tried something new.   Ordered Herbi sandwich- girl who took my order wrote it wrong. When I went to pay for the food, the cashier needed to fix the order.  My bagel sandwich was small with 3 slices of cucumber, 1 tomato & maybe 3 small sprouts.  Not sure why they are so skimpy on the sprouts.  Spouse ordered Lox Works on marble rye.  He loved it though he loves everything.    The potato salad had a lot of mustard in it.  Way too much to keep it edible.   If this place doesn't get its consultancy down then I need to find a new bake shop.  All in all, I paid $28 for food that was just \"ok\"."}
{"text":"Walk the dog here almost every Saturday as I live near by. Great serving size for the cost and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We agree with others that the bagels are average, definitely not superior. Better bagels can be found in Scottsdale at Big City Bagels. The food is generally expensive for this type of fare. The hours are nice for those who want to get an early start to the day  (they open at 5:30 AM). The owner likes to keep it pretty chilly in the restaurant. Their excuse is that the workers are warm. Never mind the customers I guess. Also, they have the music jacked up too loud making it difficult to hold a conversation or relax and read the paper with a sandwich, coffee, and paper. We also didn't like the fact that in the December 2013 restaurant inspections, they had seven violations. By far the most of any other restaurant rated in the paper for that month. Just by looking at the place it's pretty easy to tell why that is. Not overly clean and not much attention given to the ambiance."}
{"text":"Really like this place.  I usually stop in a couple times a month for lunch after I hit the gym next door.  It has a really home-y feel to it.  The service is friendly and always seems happy to have my business.  The bagel sandwiches are delicious, and the bagels especially taste fresh.  Great assortment, good menu, fair prices, good service - that's why I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this bagel shop! Found this place on yelp. Its close to my fiances work I'm definitely gonna  stop here for breakfast before dropping him off.  I tried the everything bagel toasted with egg tomatoes and  melted pepper jack cheese with a fresh squeezed oj all natural! The restaurant has a large seating area and a very large menu to choose from bagels,  wraps, bagel hot dogs, specialty sandwiches, salads, donuts,  drinks and smoothies."}
{"text":"Great place.  Great service.  I'm still searching for an everything bagel in Phoenix that has amazing flavor.  I haven't found it yet.  In the mean time, I'll give my business to this lovely bagel joint."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast. Really good bagels and awesome eggs breakfast sandwich! If you're looking for a quick breakfast, highly recommended."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is from Long Island, NY, and the bagel shops there are incredible.   So keep in mind that we are a little biased.  The customer service here is good and the food is decent, but the prices are a little expensive for what you get, and what you get isn't incredible.    Bonus points for free wi-fi, plus they have coupons all the time, so if you have one, stop in.  You won't be disappointed, I just doubt you'll be jumping for joy either."}
{"text":"On a nice thursday morning last week, I had nothing in my house to eat for breakfast.   I had always seen this place because it's next door to my gym, so I figured I'd give it a chance.  THIS, is your local neighborhood bagelry. It's a fun vibe, the kind of place you want to sit and chat with friends.  Although I took my order to go, the lovely woman at the counter was a sweetheart. I ordered a very bizarre breakfast because I am trying to stay fit. Egg white scramble with swiss cheese....and a side of lox. She didn't judge me for my strange order. In fact, she commended me for it.  Thank God.  The lox were phenom! A little on the pricey side ($6.50 for 3oz), but everything good comes at a price. The egg white scramble was only $3.   Everything tasted great.   I am coming back. Not just because the food was awesome....but because I felt welcome."}
{"text":"Delicious & good sized portions which is good since they're a little on the pricey side.  Had the Lox & Bagel sandwich."}
{"text":"Meh.  I wasn't very impressed with the bagel.  The crust was crispy but was way too flakey.  It actually almost tasted like a croissant.  They did a good job of toasting it though so that the cream cheese melted just right.  They don't have a case full of salads, which as we all know is how I measure a bagel shop, nor do they offer whitefish salad which is a staple.  You must offer it to be considered legit.  The service was quick, they have a pretty good system going on.  The place was packed with people (I didn't notice age or anything because I mean honestly, it's a bagel shop.  Who cares?)  on a Saturday morning.  They only really have fountain drinks, they do have Snapple diet raspberry iced tea and Kiwi Strawberry but that's it.  How do you not stock regular Snapple iced tea if you're stocking Snapple?  Hell, my junior high's cafeteria stocked it.   This is a 3.5, had they stocked regular Snapple I would have given them a 4."}
{"text":"This place has by far the best bagels in town.  You get a bakers dozen for the same price as Einstein bagels, but these bagels are huge and taste fantastic!  I love the sesame, it's my favorite.  Inside the place isn't fancy, could use a clean up and some remodeling, but you don't go there for the ambiance..... You go for the great bagels!"}
{"text":"We ordered bagels, cream cheese and iced tea to take on our vacation to San Diego. Of course we had VIP treatment as they do with every customer. All the \"extras\" were very much appreciated as were the delicious food and drink. BEST bagels and ICED TEA! Thanks so much Michele!"}
{"text":"My main complaint with this location is the overall worn down and dirty feeling I got in the restaurant. There was a thick layer of dust on the window sill, the child \"play area\" had Lego blocks that looked like they have never been wiped down (literally brown/black smudges), there was rust on the floor under one of the signs, and the ceiling panels also looked worn and dirty. If this is how the place looks visibly to customers I cannot imagine how the kitchen looks. Overall grossed me out and made it difficult to enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"My family checked this place out on a Sunday morning. Lots of choices on the menu and reasonable prices. Service was fast and very pleasant. My husband and I each ordered egg sandwiches on bagels and we ordered a toasted cinnamon raisin bagel with butter for my son. The thing that bowled me over is the taste of the bagels! They're made fresh in the store - never frozen like some national chain that shall remain nameless - and boy can you taste the difference. The bagels are fluffy and delicious. The owner came over and chatted with us and another family having breakfast there. She made us feel like VIPs. I love patronizing locally owned businesses and we'll definitely make Lox Stock & Bagel a regular stop for our family."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Veggie Bagel Sandwich today from Lox, Stock & Bagel.  I met the owner Michelle and she was very nice and made my sandwich just the way I liked it. I had the sesame bagel which complimented the whole veggie sandwich and gave it a nice flavor. I was also able to use the Yelp Offer for a free drink with my first check in."}
{"text":"Staff here is extremely rude. I think it was either the manager or owner. She is an older lady with blonde hair. I went in today to get a bagel and I had to wait 3 minutes to pay because my fiancé had to send me money. I got up and was walking towards the register and she yelled at me and told me that I still had to pay for my bagel. She was treated me like I was trying to steal it. It was absolutely ridiculous. My family and I used to go there all the time. Definitely won't be back. Maybe she is as having a bad day but you should not be taking it out on your customers. I have worked in costumer service my whole life and I would have NEVER made anyone feel the way she made me feel today."}
{"text":"If you are craving for delicious soft bagels, this place is it!  These bagels are even better than some of the famous New York bagels.  Take your pick, choose from a wide selection of delicious bagels and bialys like French toast bagel, blueberry, Russian, Spinach and Pesto, Sundried tomato, Oreo chocolate chip, Cinnamon Goey and more!  We had the French toast with blueberry cream cheese and the Onion bagel with veggie lite and totally loved it."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We needed a quick breakfast/lunch before a Cubs spring training game, and this place was perfect. Delicious! Fresh, friendly and fabulous.  Plus we checked in on yelp and got 6 free bagels for breakfast tomorrow. Would definitely recommend highly."}
{"text":"Was visiting Scottsdale from Oregon and we came to Lox, Stock & Bagel for breakfast and was not disappointed! We love bagels and had to try some AZ kind; With the selection of bagels and cream cheese, it was hard to choose- Some bagel flavors included: Oreo chocolate chip, French toast, egg, blueberry, cinnamon raisin, and many more! There are bagel breakfast sandwiches too; I got the jalapeño bagel with jalapeño cream cheese and was sooo good. All in all, it seems to be a great little breakfast spot and will come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Had some bad discolored turkey at this restaurant the other day. Be wary of the meat on your sandwich, mine ended up in the trash. What's the point of having summer hours and what does that even mean? Does that mean that people don't eat between 2 and 4pm anymore or pick up food or does it give the lazy owners more time off? People still live in AZ all year, so you might as well just close all summer instead of your little cute summer hours sign. Scottsdale needs a better bagel place - all the new owners have done is change the prices.   At least buy a new pricing board as all your masking tape on the menu looks like a ghetto bagel shop. The price of a bagel with cream cheese and some bad turkey is 10 bucks now. Taking mu business elsewhere where they keep real hours and fresher turkey."}
{"text":"\"I'm from New York and it's hard to find a good bagel anywhere in town.\", a lady in line behind me replied, \"Oh ya? I was born and raised in Brooklyn. You're right, this is the best place.\" That's the conversation I overheard while in line on Sunday ordering my sandwich and my kids cinnamon roll from the Owner Michelle at Lox, Stock & Bagel this past Sunday. The place was packed, the line was moving quickly, the staff has the ordering, checking out and delivering food down pat and people were coming in droves. The bagels, sandwiches, & coffee are the best I think because they are 1. authentic, 2. not from a chain restaurant, 3. served up by the same, nice as pie, personable owner's and people on the planet. THEY REMEMBER YOUR NAME!! Lox, Stock & Bagel, Michelle, her husband and their staff makes what is so great about McCormick Ranch. We have places that are so good, so fresh, so unique, like a little subculture that makes us special. Spread the word, The food is great, they cater and they deserve every bit of business and attention."}
{"text":"They don't actually open when they say they will open on this and they will just ignore you from the"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos hands down. Nothing quite hits the spot like these bad boys.  I also recommend the French toast bagel. Great place to sit on the patio and enjoy a book on a lazy Sunday."}
{"text":"I love food and this is the best in town.  Try the tuna sampler.  The tuna salad is delicious and is not loaded down with mayonnaise it is served on a bed of Caesar salad with the best dressing that has just the right zap of lemon. Also try the pasta salad, this is no ordinary pasta salad the dressing is light and flavorful.  It is full of great veggies orange and green cauliflower are a special highlight for this dish.  The service is efficient and friendly.  You will feel like part of the family on the first visit."}
{"text":"I've been to this place three times and I've never had any meal short of EXCELLENT. Great (huge!) bagels too."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I live so close to this place. These bagels remind me of growing up on Long Island. You won't be disappointed. And a Yelp Offer also -- it's like striking gold!!"}
{"text":"A nice Jewish girl needs some carbs in the form of a bagel sometimes and I found just the place for my indulgence.  Came by twice last week while we were visiting.  They have a great selection of bagels.  I had the jalapeno cheese one day and a bagel egg sandwich the following day.  My husband LOVED his lox and bagel.  The owner was so nice and remembered me from my first visit.  I wish they were closer to my house but I do know we will be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Even with a coupon this place is expensive. I didn't realize until afterwards that their lox is pretty pricey.  I could've gone to Einstein Bagels and paid half of what I paid here WITHOUT A COUPON!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's been around since I've been around and it's still just as good as the first day I had it. Same lady working there every since I can remember and it's such a sweet place. Bagels, doughnuts, bagel sandwiches, coffee, all sorts of stuff."}
{"text":"\"Fair\" is the word Id use to describe lox stock and bagel. The selection of bagels at 11am is low, the tables are dirty (I cleaned it myself), and the bagels are straight up \"fair\". I ordered an egg bagel with butter. It wasn't even cut in half. I might come back as it's conveniently located near LA fitness but no guarantee"}
{"text":"Let me just preface by saying that I am very picky about my bagels and bagel shops. I used to work at a wonderful shop with great bagels back in the day. It's been hard to find a good bagel in the valley since.  My husband and I were in the mood for some bagel sandwiches. After being disappointed with the bagel shop selections located around us, we were determined to try to find \"the one\". After scoping out Yelp, seeing it was close-by and had great reviews we decided to try Lox, Stock & Bagel.  From the moment we walked in we were greeted by Patrick, Michelle and staff I knew we hit the jackpot. They were so personable and friendly, honored our Yelp 6 free bagels without question and were super patient with our large order.  As for the menu, lots of selection! Our food arrived in the right amount of time AND the whole wheat mixed bagel is nothing short of incredible!  Loved the chill, comfy atmosphere. (although, I'm not going to lie--the big mirrors on the wall need to go!)  We will definitely be back--with our 3 1/2 year old, since there was plenty of kid toys to keep him busy while we take our time eating.   Can't wait to try one of the bagels we brought home for breakfast tomorrow morning!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. And it is only getting worse.     You can stand there waiting for service while three employees stare aimlessly into space.    Their hygiene is as poor and their service.    The quality of the product is also sharply on the decline while prices remain high.    It seems like this establishment must be under new management or are desperate for bankruptcy status.    Sell out and go to the Einstein bagel store....,,"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Ordered a wrap sandwich & pasta salad on the side. $13!! Subway is right down the street! Turns out the portions are big enough to feed 4 people, but I just want a quick affordable lunch. So does everyone else judging by the empty restaurant at noon. Also, I find it offensive when QSR type places ask for tips.  Again, subway does the same thing, FASTER, and doesn't ask for tips. Interior is drab and sad, besides one hallway with framed pics you can't see from the dining area. They get 2 stars vs. 1 for being local."}
{"text":"We drove over 13 miles from our Marriott Timeshare to use a Groupon we had.  The phone said they closed at 3.  The Website they said closed at 3  We got there a little after 1 PM and they had two signs over the 3 o'clock sign on the door. The lower one said closing at 2.. off season hours.  The other one on top said closing at 1.  Apparently from reading other posts, this is not a one time deal.  Someone was in there.  2-3 other parties tried to get in and they wouldn't open the door."}
{"text":"Ok so I got a salt bagel and cream cheese. The salt bagel was wayyy too salty ..I know I know its a salt bagel, but seriously it was beyond salty and I couldnt brush some of it off. Which I generally can it was like baked in or something. It was pretty good but the texture was not that of a bagel it was more like a kaiser roll shaped like a bagel. For over 3 bucks for a bagel (retarded) I think it should be like the best bagel that ever happened.  I'd give it another shot because it is better than Chompies and other places Ive been but I will not have another salt bagel.   I also did not check the ingredients for trans fat or shortening so that is really ruining my life right now. I will update once I find out exactly how homemade these puppies are. and then learn to live life knowing I didnt look first like I always do. but we will see.  More like 2 and a half stars but im rounding up today :)"}
{"text":"This place is decent, but not quite what it was yelped up to be.  One reason is they give 6 bagels in exchange for a positive review. Bagels are good, but the lox and breakfast burrito were just ok."}
{"text":"After leaving another place without breakfast, we decided to try Lox Stock & Bagel.  This was a good choice.  Bagels and Bialys are really great.  I was able to get a great bialy sandwich.  My husband had the chicken salad bagel sandwich.  It was great tasting.  And my little girl was very entertained while she ate her scrambled eggs.  We will be coming back to taste other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I came today to get breakfast. The line wasn't long so I got my order in right the way. The guy at the cashier was nice. So I waited over ten mins for my two eggs sunny side up and one sausage. Then when it came out it was wrong.   I ask for sunny side up. They both came out over hard.  Then they proceed to change my order. I waited another 10 mins then I finally came to ask the girl at the cashier how long it would take to make two eggs and a sausage since I have been waiting for 15 mins. She then tell me this.  \" well it takes long cause they are making it fresh\". First of all. What restaurant doesn't make eggs fresh. It's not McDonald.  Then I said to her I have been waiting 15 mins and she went on to tell me the same thing and after I gave her a silly look, she finally went into the kitchen to check and the food was ready.  The sad thing is that when my eggs came out. One was sunny side up and the other was over hard. Now since I am super hungry. I didn't bother to tell them to change it. Instead I gave it to the dog outside so it won't be a waste.  Then there was no bread or anything to eat with them, and since they don't come with it. They should at least mentioned it to the customer.   Not only I don't have any bread but they lost money by not asking me if I want bread.  I know it's hard to work and the kitchen and taking order and punching it into a machine is super hard too but owner(s) please at least train your employees about basic common sense. If you fucked up someone's order. You should get back and cook them one right away since they are supposed to have there food already.  Definitely the first and the last.  Would never recommend this place. They are lucky they get a one star. I would have given them a negative star.  It definitely sounds like Ioathe this place but seriously. How many times can you fuck up an order of two eggs and sausage."}
{"text":"WOW! This place has THE best bagels, hands down. I could eat their bagels everyday! I usually just get a toasted egg bagel with plain cream cheese and it's ALWAYS perfect. Sometimes I add lox and it's tasty too. They have many varieties of bagels and cream cheeses to choose from. You can eat there or take them home. My husband always gets one of their bagel breakfast sandwiches and it is consistently good. I have been going there since 1999 and have NEVER been disappointed. If you want to finally try what a bagel should taste like (be prepared to be hooked on it) you need to come here."}
{"text":"Lox, stock, bagels is the best bagel place in Arizona.  Michelle is always friendly and the food is delicious.  It's worth a trip."}
{"text":"Quick service and delicious bagels. The bagel was toasted to perfection. It had just the right amount of crunch yet still the softness that you want in a bite of bagel. They put just the right amount of cream cheese on it for my liking. Veggie cream cheese was very yummy. Made this bagel craving pregnant woman happy!"}
{"text":"Good bagels, but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Want to have it your way?  You might have to go to Burger King for that, or someplace else that's not Lox Stock & Bagel.  I made the mistake of trying to create my own bagel sandwich and was immediately told, \"That's The Works,\" by the guy behind the counter as he wrote \"Works\" on the order sheet.     I looked at the menu and saw that The Works cost $10.50 and had several components I hadn't asked for, including a side order of potato salad or coleslaw.  After much discussion, the guy finally agreed to make the sandwich to my specifications, including putting the two bagel halves on top of each other - crazy, right? - instead of being served open-faced.  This consent was not given without a strong word of caution that \"The Works\" would be very difficult to eat as a closed sandwich.   Let me tell you, I have eaten many a large bagel sandwich, sub, torta, you name it, in my lifetime and I was quite confident I'd be able to manage this one.  Indeed I was able to eat my modified Works sandwich closed-faced, thank you very much.  It was actually pretty tasty, albeit salty, but what an ordeal.  Burger King is definitely onto something..."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect from a local bagel joint. Clean booths and tables. Fantastic coffee hot and ready to go. The bagels and lox hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Since the new ownership in the last year this place has been a disaster. The rudest employees and if you complain to the owner's daughter she will bully you. This place was a favorite bagel spot before this new ownership. They are also hugely disorganized and it's a simple fix - don't hire your friends and family - hire experienced staff and who know how to give good customer service."}
{"text":"Locally owned and operated!!! Fresh ingredients, super friendly staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The bagels taste very weird. Not chewy, had kind of a store brand feel to it. Had the egg bagel With veggie cream cheese. Not good. Cream cheese was overwhelmingly onion. Overpriced. Bagel, cream cheese, and soda was almost $7."}
{"text":"Bagels were very good chewy texture nice and plump hate those kind that are full of air holes this is a nice little find owner was working and making orders very friendly and patient as my 87 year old Mother took her time ordering will definitely return maybe today!!"}
{"text":"This place really feels like you are asking your mom to make you a bagel based meals. She will give you just about anything you want and it will be delicious.   My favorite is the egg, cheese and bacon on a sesame seed bagel.   Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Seriously, my favorite bagels in Scottsdale! Bagels are cooked perfectly and they use quality ingredients to make the best bagel sandwich. Their cream cheese is homemade. I'm not a huge coffee drinker and I always get their iced coffee, as well. If you're not a bagel person, their breakfast burritos are on point, as well. It's definitely worth stopping by and checking out!"}
{"text":"First of all my wife's order came to her completely wrong. The girl seemed put out that the sandwich had to be remade but when you order a bagel with bacon, egg and provolone and get ham with cheddar cheese that's a tad off. End result, her sandwich was good but the breakfast burrito was just average. Big but average. This place needs to get better with their customer service and hire people with just a little personality."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  The choice of bagels are amazing, there as so many selections of cream cheese, the place is adorable and the staff does a great job!  This is a \"mom and pop\" owned cafe and I really like supporting local & family owned businesses.  It's so important to support our neighborhoods and community.    They do a delicious bagel turkey sandwich with melted cheese and tomatoes! It's faaaaaaabulous!!  LOVE Lox, Stock!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I have a special place in my heart for this place since it is owned by some of the same people who started Bagel & Bagel, which was in STL and KC in the early/mid 90s, before being acquired, then ruined by Einstein's. Lox Stock & Bagel has many of the same B&B spreads that take me back to college days at KU.  I'm kind of a bagel snob, was raised on and prefer east coast, water bagels. So this place is NOT that, but still tasty, consistent.  The staff is very nice, and even though I moved almost two years ago, they always remember me by name when I'm back in town. It's got a great community vibe and they serve the locally made, China Myst tea (yum)."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with everything bagels but, often sad when I get the one that doesn't have much of \"everything\" on it! They make the perfect Mixed Topping bagel as they call it. Completely covered on both sides and it doesn't fall off. If I lived in the area I would be here every week. We also had an egg and bacon sandwich on a salt bagel. Very good, made fresh and brought to our table."}
{"text":"I love Lox, Stock and Bagel. I've been going there from over 10 years and couldn't be happier with the food, service and fellowship. Yes, I said fellowship! I go there so often that I latched on to a group of guys who meet for coffee most mornings. It's a great place to meet new people or hang with old friends. Thanks Lox, Stock for making me feel part of something special."}
{"text":"I have been goingt to Lox Stock and Bagel for years. It is a family owned, fresh out of the oven delicatessen and bakery. The bagels are the best in town and the cream cheese selection is wonderful. My favorite item is the fruit, yogurt and granola parfait, delicious! The best bagel hands down is the cinnamon goey. I can always count on Lox Stock to satisfy whatever bagel craving I am having at the moment. The coffee is always hot, the service is always fast and friendly and the food is always fabulous!"}
{"text":"I prefer a simple bagel - toasted blueberry with strawberry cream cheese. My boyfriend prefers spice and had the opportunity to try a cheddar jalapeno bagel with jalapeno cream cheese!  They have a huge selection. It is in a simple strip mall with lots of parking.  The decor is nothing fancy but I love the local feel. If you like bagels, stop here!"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for vacation, and was looking for something nearby for breakfast. This came up on Yelp, and they had a great check-in offer, and we love bagels. We liked the punny name of the place as well.   The decor reminds me of a donut shop, just with bagels instead. Everything is clean and well-lit.   I got a egg and cheese bagel sandwich, and hubby got some mixed bagels with cream cheese. Both of us really enjoyed what we got.   The bagels toasted well, and were quite tasty. Crisp outside with a soft center without being overly chewy. The egg was cooked well.  The cream cheese on hubby's bagels is smooth and yummy. They also had a number of other cream cheese flavors.  Good variety of drip coffee. I got the French roast, and enjoyed it.  Service was welcoming and friendly.   Overall, quite a great place."}
{"text":"I went here last weekend with my husband to use my Groupon, and bought into the name a bit too much, as I was hoping I'd finally find my dream bagel (my hubs is from NYC and oh how I miss the bagels!).  Well I got the Lox bagel with the works, and while it certainly did not disappoint, it was not the \"dream bagel\".  It was the best one I've found in AZ two years in so far, so 4 stars for that.  My husband got a plain turkey bagel with cheese and was pleased with his.  The spread they give for the Lox bagel was perfectly spread out with all of the key ingredients and was visually pleasing as well.  It was a treat I'd order again.  They seem to do quite a business there, but the line flowed seamlessly and the staff was polite and efficient.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place has really good bagels. I don't crave bagels often, but when I do I come here. My favorite is the spinach pesto. This is probably the only place I've seen with this flavor. I like mines toasted with plain butter. Simple and yummy goodness.    Their salads are good, too. I will alternate between the spinach salad and the red pepper chicken salad. The spinach salad is topped with bacon bits and sliced strawberries. The sliced chicken in the red pepper salad is kind of different. It looks slightly odd but it is really tasty. Both salads come lightly dressed (which I prefer) and in large portions. The first time I ordered it, I thought they had forgot to put the dressing on (that's how light it is). But when I tasted it, it was full of flavor. You easily can make two meals out of these salads. Their salad also comes with a bagel of your choice.  Excellent choice for breakfast or lunch. I've never had their bagel sandwiches but my coworkers all seem to enjoy them."}
{"text":"This was a great neighborhood find. I'm not huge on bagels, but I really like these. The bagels are made fresh everyday and are just right. Michelle, the owner, is very nice and friendly, even when obviously busy. I consider myself lucky to have this place right across the street. The World's Pickiest Eater and I usually get a Tuna Melt on Whole Wheat Mixed with Avocado added after it comes out of the toaster. So good and it is totally big enough to split."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito:  Ham, Egg, Bacon, Potatoes and Cheese Wrapped Into a Grande Flour Tortilla. Yum!  Toasty croissant with sausage, egg and cheese. Yum!  6 free bagels of our choice with our Yelp check in.  Score!  I sooo wanted a lox and bagel but being preggy, I sadly had to pass.  But it looked deelish from what I saw at the table next to us.  I thought it was cute they had a little legos table there to occupy the kiddies.  Staff was friendly and we will be back if we're in the area again....."}
{"text":"Delicious. This is a real bagel place. How do I know? They have salt bagels. Nuf said. Star deducted for lack of ambience. Lackluster decor in a strip mall setting."}
{"text":"Great little bagel spot. Staff is very friendly and the restaurant seems very clean. You can definitely tell its family owned! I got an egg, cheese, and sausage breakfast sandwich on a honey wheat bagel. Wasn't gourmet, but it was exactly what I wanted. Bagel was amazing though. I'll be back for a bagel and cream cheese."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced for what it is. I grew up on lox stock and it used to be one of my favorite places!!! The bagels were amazingly soft and delicious. Now that the old owners are gone, the bagels are hard and the cream cheese tubs we ordered to go were moldy! We were having a huge family breakfast and by the time we got home Lox stock was closed. Lame for the price we paid."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed I've been living in the McCormick Ranch area for almost 10 years and always go to lock stock and bagel's almost every Sunday it's usually packed all the time and just recently they switched owners and the place was in bad shape! Food in the glass cases was all messed . up the young kids that work there had no idea what they're doing even though the bagels were toasted they were cold by the time they gave them to me and there's nobody in there anymore"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 lox bagels with eggs for $7.5 each. The bagel was small, no additions were served. Most importantly, the cafe latte was spoiled due to the milk that was expired. They told us that they haven't used the cappuccino machine in a while (!?). We have had a bad experience with this place."}
{"text":"I seek out bagel places when I'm on vacation, so have a pretty good stock of them for comparison - this one didn't disappoint! Good selection, nice service, plenty of room - I'd definitely come back and try more flavors if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Bagels were good. Staff was super friendly. I wasn't impressed with the bagels in general though. I'm a huge bagel guy and these bagels weren't impressive at all, but they were good nonetheless. I'll be back to try a couple other items."}
{"text":"Nice local bagel shop, opens at 5:30AM, and not part of a chain which is a big plus.  NYC style?  Close enough for AZ.    Bagels are as good as you will get in the Valley, just short of that chewy tasty bagel we all enjoy in NYC.  That said they aren't bad and there is a pretty good selection of bagels, spreads are also numerous (try the southwest!).  Owners are super nice, again yet another plus.  So a 4 for now, this is my second review and I will be back.  Bottom-line the positives outweighed the small dings I would highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"The bagels are soft & chewy; the spreads are fantastic (I love the honey-whipped peanut butter); and the coffees are surprisingly excellent. I don't know what part of the food I love more.  The service couldn't be better; the owners & managers are personal and friendly, and the staff is well trained and attentive. My favorite place to eat for any meal."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here. The staff is always so wonderful and nice. Bagels are phenomenal, haven't worked my way into trying anything else just yet but so far I'm a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Wonderful warm welcome and delicious bagels!  My husband and I came in for the first time and I felt like we came over to a friend's house.  The owner offered to let us taste the bagels, made me a special order sandwich, and told us all about how their bagels are home made from scratch, every day.  She even reminded us that we get half a dozen bagels to take home with our check-in - how generous!  The bagels themselves are delicious, as were the fixins.  We ate them for serveral days afterwards: the pumpernickel is light and flavorful, the everything has tons of stuff on it, and the rest were great, too! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great East coast style Jewish bagels. Tasty and crispy outside, chewy inside. So many flavors to choose from and delicious toppings!  Always make a stop here!"}
{"text":"I start by saying this was not the place my father and I were to meet at, but we did after some communication issues planted us there. I was not very impressed with their staff nor the food. The  L.E.O. for which for those of us know is a Lox, eggs and onions breakfast.  It came UN-cooked wet with about 1 oz. of lox. The bagel they served was dry and cost me $1.50 just for butter or cream cheese. I'm not a New Yorker any more but I know a good place to go and this is not it. Stay away and go to NY Bagel and Bialies where we were going to meet in the first place."}
{"text":"There are bagels and then there are BAGELS. And this small bagelry/café has got that covered. Some of the most tender, tastiest I have ever sunk my teeth into.  I am not a local, but if I were, this would be a place I would frequent often. And that goes for Mr. B as well. He's the guy that would normally protest loudly when I suggest bagels. I had to practice some tough love, but not for long!  We came for breakfast.  I had a groupon. What a find, what a deal!  Their nice menu of bagel sandwiches (breakfast and lunch) was hard to choose from. But I ended up with a tuna melt on an everything bagel (poppy seeds, sesame seeds and toasted onion flakes). Big and fat, heavily seeded, then toasted to perfection, there was none better.  The tuna salad was lightly mixed with mayo and yogurt, and a crunch of celery.  Not fishy.  Place a generous scoop, a layer of tomato, and lastly, cheddar melted on top and you have, tah dah, a thing of beauty. It really satisfied me, and I have to confess, I ate the whole rockin' thing...both halves...not to mention the pickle wedge that snapped when you bit into it.  Mr. B could not pass by the Lox platter, named Lox Bagel and the Works. His was a showy, big plate that started with a sliced and toasted whole wheat everything bagel, slathered with a generous amount of cream cheese, then orchestrated to perfection with very thinly sliced, tender lox (that's really important, as well as being oh so fresh!), raw red onion and tomato slices. First bite, and all I heard was an orgasmic moan. He then launched into how wonderful it was. He chose their homemade chunky mayonnaise based potato salad for his side dish.  And of course, it also came with a fresh pickle.  A simply perfect dish worth every penny.  It is no surprise our sandwiches were this good after giving the owner the 5th degree. The bakers come in each day, in the middle of the night, to make the next day's booty. And obviously they are masters of the craft. And the lox? They are flown in from New York.  If this wasn't enough, please note dear Yelpers, with any purchase, your check in will get you a bag of 6 free bagels.  You choose from a nice variety.  And next time, if you bring in a paper copy of your positive review, your next purchase will get you a discount too.  Friendly, clean, comfortable, great quality, I cannot say enough good about this place. There is no second guessing this place. It is wonderful and reasonably priced. And Max A, I again thank you for sending me those good vibes so I would come here."}
{"text":"I don't know why people hate on this place so much. I've always only ordered the breakfast bagels and they're always prepared fresh and made-to-order.   I have very high standards when it comes to my food and dining establishments in general. They've never disappointed me.   Whether it's a post-hangover breakfast sandwich or a quick bite before work!  Great place for a quick stop. The long lines and heavy foot-traffic should mean something!    Thanks for the food!"}
{"text":"I finally had the pleasure of trying one of my neighborhood bagel shops this morning on a way to an early morning wake-up call event. After having passed by Lox Stock & Bagel many times after visiting the gym. I was feeling in the mood for a morning carbo load and this is the place for that!  I walked inside and was welcomed by the scent of freshly made bagels by a local bagel shop. The staff welcome me with huge smiles, regardless of the early hour. Fresh bagels lined the walls and the second I notice a pumpkin bagel, I knew this was my place. I ordered the pumpkin bagel with pumpkin cream cheese. Turkey day is only a couple days away so I had to embrace the pumpkin season.  The shop itself has a true neighborhood bagel shop feel to it. Locals sit and chat in the chairs and the owners are curious and eager to know their customers. That's half the fun of visiting a bagel shop and I missed that feel to others around town. Since I was in a hurry, I had to be on my way, but they wished me a good day and I couldn't wait to come back again  Oh and the bagel! I enjoyed the bagel in my car and yum it was tasty! The pumpkin bagel and cream cheese both had a strong flavor to it and I decided that a plain bagel with just pumpkin cream cheese or a pumpkin bagel with regular cream cheese would do the trick as well. I'm glad that I've found my new go-to spot for my bagel cravings!"}
{"text":"Two thumbs way up!  I would drive across the Valley to buy a Herbie bagel, but fortunately I work right around the corner."}
{"text":"Lox stock is my favorite bagel place in town.  They do some wonderful catering also.  I always avoid the typical chain restaurants and while it may be hard to try a new place, you will be happy with the food at Lox Stock.  Let the boring and unadventerous go elsewhere.  It is quite possible the bagels at Lox Stock are the best you will find west of the Hudson River!"}
{"text":"Really original flavors and fresh taste we had the luck salmon bagel and breakfast egg and meets bagel would recommend this place 100%. Very friendly service"}
{"text":"We have been picking up bagels for our salon about 31/2 years now every saturday morning  . If I were to miss a day our quest would defiantlly be disappointed. I cant even change the flavor of cream cheese, it has to be plain  and veggie.Bagels I have request from my staff, as for our quest they dont care as long as I have  their  bagels!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch the other day. I had found a Groupon and wanted to use it!  I cannot ever pass up cute mom & pop type places that have my fav type of sandwich- egg salad!   This place was amazing though. Upon entering, I noticed a bunch of people that seemed like they were \"regulars\". They knew the employees by name which I love seeing. Also, there were so many bagels to choose from (I got two for breakfast the rest of this week).   I got the egg salad sandwich, potato salad as a side, a drink and two bagels.  It was all covered by my $7 groupon so I'd say that was a MAJOR WIN. The people who work there were so nice and told me they had been in business for over 20 years! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and went here based on the yelp reviews. The bagels were great, plenty of tasty cream cheese. Decent coffee... here's where things get ugly: cockroaches started crawling out of the food counter. I saw two of them. My husband informed the workers and a guy got a broom and started pushing the tiles back on the wall.  Totally ruined my appetite. Too bad because the food was great until that happened."}
{"text":"Warm, fluffy insides with just the right amount of crisp on the outside. That's exactly what you'll get a LS&B, a place I totally heart. Their cream cheese is delicious, there is a huge variety of bagels and the owners are super friendly too. I haven't tried their lunch yet but hear great things about it. You can be in and out with your coffee and bagel in under 5 minutes or stick around and use their free wifi.  Order the cream cheese on the side if you aren't a fan of having tons smothered on."}
{"text":"Wow what can I say?! These bagels are my favorite in Scottsdale. Whenever I get the chance, I stop here for breakfast. Fluffy on the inside, and toasted beautifully on the outside, these bagels are definitely made with love. They offer loads of toppings, and some of the best cream cheese I've ever had! Plus they have killer Yelp deals!!  They sure satisfy my major bagel craving!!!"}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the best bagel place around the Valley. I'm originally from the East Coast so I know good bagels. It took me awhile to find a place to fill my void for an everything bagel. Lox, Stock & Bagel filled that void! Today I tried a bialy for the first time as well, and it was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Had to move it up to five stars. These people are great for large orders for those office breakfast meetings and helps to call it in before. Great Bagels, and have been around for a long time.  Same owners, and consistent good food."}
{"text":"Was there recently with my husband. We are very particular about our bagels and only buy from certain shops in the Westchester, NY area. I always check Yelp for their reviews and this one did not disappoint!! We love the whole wheat everything (covered with seeds, salt etc.) WW Bagels were not heavy (doughy) very slightly crispy on the outside and light on the inside. Bagels were delicious, but even better, were the everything bialy's. We each had our bagel, but were still hungry and shared a bialy, which we never do! Wow was that good and light. Not your typical onion in center NY bialy with poppy seeds, but more of a lighter version of this shops bagel.  We hate doughy bagels and bialys, so if you feel the same, this is the place for the spoiled New Yorker. We will be back on our next trip for sure..."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Ted Nugent - Cat Scratch Fever)  Well I don't know where they bake from but they sure do bake I hope they're baking for me And I don't know how they do it but they sure do it good I hope they're doing it for me!  They're at Lox, Stock, Bagels Lox, Stock, Bagels!   This is a lovely little bagel joint with a lot of local love!  I came here since it as next to my gym and I told myself I'll go here for breakfast someday.  Well needless to say that someday came.  My first thought was it was definitely a mom/pop kind of place.  The decors are not too flashy and very homey.  I decided on a black coffee and a bagel sandwich with eggs, bacon, and ham on a plain bagel.  The bagel itself was soft and doughy like I prefer.  The other ingredients were okay at best.  The bacon was extra crunchy which help added texture and the egg was quite fluffy, but I prefer it runny.  The ham was pretty basic at best.  Overall, a decent breakfast, but I wouldn't say it rocked my world.    In the end, Lox, Stock & Bagel does deserve my love since it is a local business competing with the big boys.  I would definitely come back to get some bagels for the office and if you enjoy a quiet lonely breakfast; this is your place! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not so good I hate to tell you. First off, I didn't get what I ordered and was overcharged for what I did order, AND the cashier argued with me that the owner was changing the pricing and he wasn't in control. The need to change the menu board or cover the prices. He had an attitude for sure.   Now for the food. Blah! Blahzie. We both ended up with a veggie lite cream cheese with veggies. The bagels weren't fresh. The were on the stale side. I bought a few extra and tasted another one. Yep... stale. The texture of the cream cheese was weird and lumpy. My partner thought it was potato salad. I will say the veggies were fresh though.   To top it all off, the place it just dirty. Unwiped grimy tables, dirty floors and gnats. We had one gnat; And then, all a sudden a host of them.   Well for stale bagels, strange clumpy cream cheese and attitude; I guess I'll be buying my bagels elsewhere for sure."}
{"text":"Love this cute little local bagel/breakfast shop.  Had a delish breakfast sandwich with eggs and lox.... I was expecting a cold slice of lox and cream cheese, but... it was just a pile of fluffy eggs and cooked lox mixed in.  It was delish, but not quite what I had my heart set on. But I would definitely go back!  Is it as good as NYC bagels and lox? It's pretty darn close."}
{"text":"This place seems to be getting a little run down.  They still have good bagels but my breakfast sandwich was nothing to get too excited about.  Service was friendly but it kinda seemed like everyone was just going through the motions."}
{"text":"Best customer service ever! They accidentally put cheese in my breakfast burrito when in had asked for no cheese (I'm allergic ) and they not only made it right with a new burrito but a gift card and cookies! They made it better than right!"}
{"text":"Bagels are very good. It gets kudos for being a local small business.  If you are price conscious, you may get a little sticker shock, but keep in mind that it is a \"ma & pa\" business, and therefore doesn't have the purchasing power of a chain like Einstein."}
{"text":"I go about every three to four months since Michelle sold the place. Their bagels are still better than other places. This time the clerk sliced and bagged my bagels ready for the freezer.  I'll keep coming."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it is definitely the best bagel shop in town!! They have a wide variety of bagels, cream cheese and sandwiches that are all delicious! I would personally recommend the egg and oreo bagels. Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable. They also have really good lemonade :)  Overall, if you're in the area or looking for a nice bagel/sandwich shop, check this place out!! Oh, and they offer a lot of coupons and specials on their Facebook page so be sure to check for those too!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place but I stopped in today for a sandwich and a drink and I was totally grossed out. I went to fill up my cup with ice and the dispenser where the ice comes out was covered in mildew/mold. It didn't seem to be in my ice but EW. I totally lost my appetite and it made me think, if the ice machine looks like that, what does everything else like?! What a bummer :("}
{"text":"Looking for a quick, casual place for a bagel and coffee?  This could be your place.  Just know going in that it's no frills; it's exactly that: a quick, casual place for a bagel, muffin, coffee, or sandwich.  The menu is pretty limited beyond those things.  LS&B is a fast-casual concept where you order at the counter and pay and then sit down and they bring you your food.  I met a friend here recently for Sunday breakfast.  I had my husband in tow and she had two kids...  we had a decent experience but it definitely didn't blow me away.  My friend went with a bagel and lox plate (i assume this is their signature dish).  I had a bagel and egg sandwich, Jared had a couple of bagels, and the kids had a bagel and a large cookie.  The food was just ok.  I have to say I like the bagels better elsewhere in the Valley, and even in Detroit.  I know not to compare to NY or my rating would be even lower.    Positive reasons for coming here are that they are super quick, they offer indoor and outdoor seating, friendly service, and a lego table where the little ones can play.  Parking is easy as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bagels and I'm a bagel girl. Love the Sesame or Black Russian bagel with veggie cream cheese. We go here almost every weekend for the consistency and friendly team. The hazelnut coffee is smooth and one of my go-tos."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review for this amazing place and keep forgetting.  My Wife recommended riding our bikes there this morning for coffee and bagels while Grandma has the kids for a few hours.    Bottom line, the bagels are the best in town (the closest you can get to NYC).  The owners are there everyday and greet everyone with a smile...which goes a long way with me and the staff is just as helpful and friendly.  Don't waste your time or money on any of the other bagel shops is town...this one is a can't miss!  Craig   PS - it's a great place for kids too, they have etcha-sketch boards and play tables and both my kids love their bagels, donuts, and muffins.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you are in arizona and in search of bagels, bialys, cream cheese spreads, danishes, lox, etc. .......this must become your go to place.  I discovered my family had been purchasing theirs at some other local establishment and it tasted awful. It tasted just as bad as frozen lenders bagels. I immediately told them we were taking a trip (aka 10 minute car ride) over to lox, stock, and bagel and actually stocking up on all the good stuff.   I am also not usually one for small talk, but the owners and employees here and are so friendly that I can never help but to strike up a conversation with them.  You have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a friendly local bagel maker that really knows how to make home made chicken noodle soup and wonderful speads for his homemade bagels-you need to look no further. Super comfortable local vibe in the Paseo Shopping Center in McCormick Ranch-these folks moved from Kansas City many years ago and started their own shop. So if you dream of real bagels, lox and cream cheese-this is the place."}
{"text":"Good affordable deli in Scottsdale - fresh bagels, good lox. Not great if you have golfing buddies on the paleo diet, as there is very little in the way of yummy protein. Not an egg and bacon kinda place."}
{"text":"Looking forward to great bagels and cream cheese! I'll be back again! The bagels are fresh, soft, and smell delicious! Great way to start a Saturday!"}
{"text":"Oooh, this is my favorite lunch place by my office.  Super nice staff, delicious bagels.  Go for the lox special thing, it's amazing."}
{"text":"As of this very second, I was let down enough to leave it at three stars instead of 4 or 5. Why? Oh yelp reviewers, i expect so much from your reviews and that is why i love and hate this site for the sole reason that you are made to believe that ever morsel of food entering your mouth will be complete bliss and nothing less (unless stated otherwise with words of caution).   The location was right next to an L.A. Fitness how convenient(My gym, not exactly as location, but you know what i mean!) so it should be easier to find look for L.A. fitness then look to the right and there you have it!  It is a cute place i could definitely seeing myself eat at every once in awhile if i were to live close by, i am all about small mom and pop type shops.   So many bagels to choose from and things i have never even heard of or could remember at the top of my head.  What i did know at the time was i NEED to try the cinnamon gooey and the french toast. By the sounds of both they had my heart set on this breath taking image of cinnamony swirls gooey and delicious and a big mapley flavored french toast in the form of a bagel so crispy on the outside.  Out of 100% only 25% was filled with what i was imagining if not less than that(me being generous).  Severely disappointed with the cinnamon gooey because it was not what i expected what so ever. It was not really \"crisp\" it was fresh not hot but just MEH never again kind of a taste especially to pay extra because its a \"special\" bagel or whatever. Pshhh Not in my book. I could find better for less at Einsteins and its better but smaller and cinnamon on it is equally distributed unlike Lox's.  The honey almond cream cheese was not a winner. Just ordinary with a hint of honey and good amount of almond slivers.  The French toast bagel on the hand is different i loved the fluffiness in one bite! cannot wait to eat the rest this morning. The strawberry cream cheese was delicious but like i said you can always find something similar or better for less elsewhere.  It did not have a mapley flavor like i was hoping but the fluffiness caught my attention crisp and fluffy! NICE.   Service was awesome i dont know what foursquare people are thinking or who they spoke with. I was grungy looking and they treated me fine. Now i can understand if you are being a Scottsdale typical snob and fitting the stereotype or just being a bitchy customer than you deserve it. Pardon my French but I will state it as it is.  I do not sugar coat honey.  The nice things with mom and pop places is that they have the right to refuse service but are trying to make their profit and probably can't say no to the people that are acting like douche bags.   If i am in the area i will stop and try more again. But i will never go out of my way again for this(unless my best friend comes out i will go for that but that's it!)"}
{"text":"Great location and perfect breakfast spot. The bagel breakfast sandwiches were very good. The coffee selection was decent too. Will definitely visit again next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Bagels are pretty good! They have so many different kinds and I was like a kid in a candy shop. I would have loved to order a bunch of bagels especially the most desert ones the like cinnamon ones. Only thing I was kinda sad about was when I ordered my juice I thought it would be fresh since it said fresh juice but the apple juice came from a 'Tree Top' or some brand like that container. Major bummer but I went there for the bagel not the juice. Still an awesome bagel. My only suggestion would be getting the Simply Apple juice if fresh is not possible."}
{"text":"I look a good breakfast sandwich bagel. My husband and I visit this place pretty frequently.   They're so friendly and nice and really go above and beyond to custom my sandwich. They even hollow out the bagel for me without judging me."}
{"text":"Worst Breakfast Burrito for too much money.  For $9 - basically scrambled eggs and a flour tortilla.   I told them not to add ham because I read on their web site before I drove over that there was bacon.  No bacon and could not taste the cheese.   I asked for light egg and potato and was talked out of it...  \"we only put in 2 eggs\"  Well it was one too many.   The salsa was the horrible NYC type.   We are too close to the border for that. It was nice and hot though."}
{"text":"Lox Stock & Bagel offers great food in a friendly atmosphere.  From the bagels to the lox to the cream cheese everything is tasty and fresh. For a great meal of bagels, don't miss this!!"}
{"text":"Great bagels.  I had the lox and it was delicious.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Whenever we find a groupon, living social or any deal for a place we have never been to but might be interested in trying, we take the plunge and buy it. Such is the case with lox, stock and barrel which isn't even in the vicinity of where we live, but turns out definitely worth the drive. With bagels almost as big as your face and the freshest taste and cream cheese choices, there is no doubt this won't be our first visit.  I did find the whole ordering process to be a bit confusing which I think would help myself and others were it better organized. But overall they offer take out and order and sit down service.  No waitress service from what I can tell. Can't wait to go back and try other varieties but the cinnamon gooey was a slice of heaven."}
{"text":"A cozy bright bagel shop located in a strip mall serving bagels, sandwiches and more.  We were looking for something low-key for breakfast and found this place online.  The large number of positive reviews motivated us to make the drive on a Sunday morning.  At 8:30 the place was pretty quiet and there was no wait at all.  They offer a large variety of bagels (we opted for 'everything bagels') and around a dozen or so cream cheeses (I got veggie, my wife chive).  We ordered the bagels toasted and shared a small orange juice.  Total around $10.  The brought our food to us at one of the small tables.  The bagels were light and crispy, served open-faced with just the right amount of cream cheese spread carefully on each half.  All in all a nice, quiet breakfast.  Recommended"}
{"text":"Was not overly impressed with the bagels here and didn't think it lived up to the hype of all the reviews.   Would say they were just average. Both mine and my friends order did not come out how we wanted and my friend was overcharged.   Would try another bagel place before coming back."}
{"text":"Bagels are fairly authentic. Lox and bagel sandwich on toasted salt bagel was delicious with generous quantity of nova lox. Black olives on this sandwich? Just say no. As a native New Yorker, I given this place a high pass. Service is neutral (neither friendly nor unfriendly)."}
{"text":"Just a brief review to let you know that this is STILL a great local business that deserves your bagel business.  Small shop with 5 outside tables and seating for about 40 inside.  The bagels here are crusty on the outside and chewy inside.  Staff is friendly and efficient.  Place your order at the counter, pay, give cashier your name, and your order will be delivered in less than 5 minutes.  They have about 4-5 blends of coffee daily and, they offer free coffee with a yelp check in. (must order at least a bagel)  Prices are reasonable and they do have a punch card for dozens"}
{"text":"The bagels here are delicious -- we normally get the sausage, egg & cheese. And they couldn't be more fresh.  The thing I have an issue with is the Lox bagel (a bagel with smoked salmon & cream cheese & then normally capers, red onions, & sometimes tomatoes). I told them I just wanted a Lox bagel & they said the only option is the *Special* which is \"Lox, Bagel & the Works - Lox, cream cheese, onion, tomato, black olives, pickle and potato salad or coleslaw\" for $11. So I told the guy that I wanted just the bagel, no side (it was 8am...). The guy said its still $11 even without the side. For that to be the only option and for them to not have an option with only the bagel, no side for lets say, $8 is so bizarre especially when the restaurant has the word 'Lox' in their name. You can find a cheaper Lox bagel in NYC."}
{"text":"Best bagels in arizona!! They blueberry bagels with blueberry creme cheese is amazing!! They are fresh daily, never hard or lacking flavor. They owners are amazing and the people definitely are friendly and remember me no matter how often or little I am in there. The prices are right and they will go above and beyond to toast your bagel exactly the way you want it! Even the young people there are very friendly and inviting!! Check it out and hit the gym next door, to keep that spare tire at bay! ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local places to go! Worth the money. Excellent bagels.  I have tried 80% of the menu over the last 10 years, and I don't think I have had anything that was not wonderful.  Tuna sandwich is my favorite!  Everyone is super sweet and I love that it is owner operated!"}
{"text":"Just tried it today and it's in, the best breakfast spot in the valley!    I got a Poppyseed Bagel with Strawberry Cream Cheese, Cole Slaw, and Bacon. It was all delicious and a good atmosphere! The owners seem to be running the restaurant and they have a large selection of a variety of breakfast selections. I'd recommend trying it over Einsteins any day of the week!  Stop in and give it a shot. Don't let your GPS confuse you though as to its location like mine did."}
{"text":"I used to really love eating here but something has changed in the past few months. The bagels have diminished in quality. I used to love the cinnamon gooey bagel but they no longer have the crystallized cinnamon sugar topping and they are as flat as pancakes. If you're lucky you might get a plain bagel with a dust of cinnamon on it. I hope they improve their bagel making quality because this place used to be something special for breakfast."}
{"text":"More great bagels, they are the best outside of NYC, here twice this week, love the veggie cream cheese too!"}
{"text":"Service with a smile is just the beginning to this local bagel shop.  I highly recommend getting a mixed topping bagel with tuna, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato, and a slice of provolone cheese.  Dont pass up on getting a side of the tuna salad while you are at it.  This is by far the best bagel shop in the state."}
{"text":"Love this place! The bagels are always fresh and breakfast sandwiches never disappoint! Bagel, egg, cheese, and veggies cream cheese is awesome! Also the check in deal is great! This is a weekly stop for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's go to spot for a quick, delicious breakfast. Not only are their bagels delicious, they have a lot of other menu items that are great as well (I love their oatmeal and their breakfast burrito)! The owners, Pat and Michelle, are always there to greet us by name and have a quick chat. Great place, great food!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot with a great selection of bagels. The Lox was good and I got a decent portion of it. I got the side of fruit with it. Most of the fruit wasn't ripe which is a pet peeve of mine at a restaurant. But it happens a lot. Took home a cinnamon swirl bagel that ate like a dessert. I could see myself sitting here for a couple hours with a book just lounging."}
{"text":"This is such a great bagel place! They have a great assortment of flavors of bagels, bilays and shmears!  I personally love a more crispy, not as doughy bagel and if you like that too, I would recommend the bilays! They are fantastic. They have less sugar and are crispier and lighter than an average bagel.   I love the everything bialy or whole wheat bialy with the \"dip\" schmear add cucumber, tomatoes and capers. The dip spread is a salsa style schmear and should be tried at least once!  They also have an assortment of sandwiches and side salads, lox, and pasteries. I would also recommend their yummy cinnamon and sugar bagel chips that they use from day old bagels. They are amazing with a little bit of cream cheese!  Their passion fruit iced tea is almost a must while you are there.  The place is always busy but they have plenty of seating inside as well as a few tables and chairs outside. The service is very friendly. Also, if you check in on yelp, you get 1 free coffee or soda!  Love this place and i will definitley be back next time i am in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Love all their bagels and fresh veggie cream cheese. Everything I have ever tried has been good. Owners are always working and are very friendly."}
{"text":"Best bagels on the planet, hands down. Great people too....moved to California 7 years ago but always stop by when i am in town visiting and they still call me by my name and act as if i am an everyday customer. It doesn't get any better than this place"}
{"text":"Loveeee that they have a punch card I'm all about freebies!! Great selection def a mom and pop situation. You have to try these homemade bagels, soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat in or take out. We have done both. Food is always fresh, bagels are the best. A must!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best bagel shops in the area!   I am a gym-aholic and go to the LA Fitness that is in the same plaza every morning around 5 or 5:30. Directly from there, I can head over to Lox Stock & Bagel to grab a morning coffee and something to eat if I'm hungry.   Originally, I wasn't sure about it and had never tried it. I would always go to the Starbucks drive thru on my way to work instead of heading there. Then a friend of mine suggested going there (he stops there on his way to work every day). I tried it, and it was a great choice!  There are always about 4 or 5 types of fresh drip coffee to choose from, and plenty of other choices on the menu. TONS of bagels and bialys to choose from, and sandwiches, etc.  Try the Hazelnut Vanilla coffee - it's awesome! Also, the sundried tomato bagel is killer! Get it toasted: it's perfectly crunchy on the outside and chewy (but not heavy) on the inside.  Plus, it's open early enough for me to go there at the crack of dawn! Convenient, really reasonable pricing and great product!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 10+ years. Never a bad meal and I've had everything. I'm allergic to corn and every bagel place out here has cornmeal on the bottom, not this place!  REAL BAGELS IN ARIZONA!!?? WOW. These taste just like the ones back home in New Jersey!!  Best toppings amount and bagel size in the valley."}
{"text":"Being from the Northeast, I'm always hesitant to trust a bagel, or any bread product, on the other side of the country but man, this place did not disappoint. It was so good we came back the next day! The best part was that the bacon was crispy! Finally, CRISPY BACON! Yummmmmmm :)"}
{"text":"Their service was nice, but the quality of bagel wasn't what other reviewers said.  Very disappointed since I am new to Phoenix.  I don't know how other reviewers gave 5 stars."}
{"text":"They sell bagels to Courtesy Chevrolet's cafe, and I couldn't believe my taste buds.  This bagel is equal to any I've ever had, even the old H&H in NYC.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'll be coming back to the Chevy dealer for breakfast because I live so far away from their shop."}
{"text":"The bagels here are GIANT.   That's really all I came here to say, but I will also mention that they taste delicious. Especially their honey wheat bagels (so good with herb cream cheese or in place of bread for a sandwich). The one thing that I'm a little disappointed in are their egg bagels. It's just not the flavor I'm used to.   I highly recommend being on their mailing list. They have fantastic deals, as well as give you a free dozen bagels for your birthday and anniversary. Why yes, I would like enough bagels to feed my family for days, thank you."}
{"text":"What wonderful bagels!  These have got to be the best bagels outside of New York.  Even then, LS&B would give some NYC bagel shops a run for their money.  The rye and pumpernickel bagels certainly satisfy that yearning for a far superior product than what is otherwise available elsewhere.  I am so glad to have found Lox Stock & Bagel.  The next time I am in the Phoenix area, I will make another visit.  Believe me, it is worth even a special trip from elsewhere in the valley.  Just wish there was one close to me at home.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Yelp did it again.  It helped me locate this fantastic bagel shop.   I was on a visit trip to visit the BFF and her fiancé.  We read the reviews and decided to try this joint out.    My first reaction: the bagels are HUGE.   I had the whole wheat mixed topping bagel with honey almond cream cheese.  Others ordered: sun dried tomato with plain cream cheese and blueberry with plain cream cheese.    Great comments about the sun dried tomato bagel.  The blueberry bagel was okay.  Honey almond cream cheese was great, probably can be a little more sweet, but no complaints.  Mixed topping was salty but the honey almond balanced it out.    The bagels did not disappoint; in addition to the size, it was soft and fresh.  The service was great.    Two bagels with cream cheese and two coffees will run you about 12-13 dollars.   Seating area is abundance and crowded on weekends.    We used the \"mention Yelp and get 6 free bagels.\"  A lady was gracious and thanked us for checking the place out.    Definitely a place to go for some good bagels!"}
{"text":"A Bagel Card!  Every seventh bagel and cream cheese free!  I didn't really need an excuse to get the best bagel I've ever had west of the Mississippi, but it doesn't hurt to have one!"}
{"text":"Do not miss this fabulous restaurant!!!  The food is OUTSTANDING...GREAT value for the price. Best Nova/Lox plate I have ever eaten. Hubby is very picky...he said the homemade vinaigrette on his chicken salad was the best and his salad was extremely fresh and delicious....BEST bagels anywhere in Scottsdale! HIGHLY recommend!!"}
{"text":"I friggin love this place. It has such a family feel, and you always see the same staff (a couple, I think they must be the owners) every weekend. They definitely don't let you take your time as you order before you pay, but you get your food very quickly and they bring it right over to your table. The bagels are delicious and the smoked salmon bagel (The Works) is enough for two-- just get an additional bagel with cream cheese and you're good!"}
{"text":"I always thought that east coast (Long Island, New York)  bagels were the best until Lox Stock & Bagel moved to McCormick Ranch.  Absolutely delicious!!  NY can't hold a candle to their products especially their bagels and bialys! We have had their bagels,breakfast ,  lunch items, etc.  No other place in the valley can  compare to their always fresh and deeelicious food.  Excellent service, never a wait.  Best coffee in town!!  Once you try LS&B, you won't go to another bagel shop.  J.S."}
{"text":"I feel bad writing this because I grew up going here, but I ordered some bagels here and they weren't very fresh and I feel their sandwiches are overpriced."}
{"text":"As relocated New Yorkers, we have searched for a good deli to satisfy our noshing needs. Sadly, this is not that place. The bagels tasted like Wonder Bread. You can get better Nova at Costco. The one thing NYC you ask? The prices! WAY too high given the mediocre food. So, We keep looking ..."}
{"text":"I will admit this review is biased, since the bagels here are the only ones I can eat, being that they're homemade AND not made with corn syrup, corn meal (at least not the ones I choose), or any other corn derivatives.  (I'm not positive about the flavored ones, such as the seasonal pumpkin bagel LS&B is offering right now through the end of the year, since \"flavored\" usually means \"natural flavors\" added, and these are derived from corn.)  Michelle, the owner, is always gracious, even when business is brisk.  It does get hectic at times, so if you're looking for more personable service, or need extra time to make a selection from all the choices offered here, you may find it best to let others go in front of you, and everyone, including yourself, will be less-frazzled.  Just took the last bite of the pumpkin bagel I tried for the first time morning, and I will most-definitely be returning to take a few more home on my next visit!  My other favorites are the Cinnamon-raisin (almost like dessert!), Marbled rye, and Honey whole wheat.  What would make me rate LS&B five stars??  1. Offer better cappuccinos and foam.   2. Offer organic and/or Fair-trade coffee options. 3. Label coffees properly to denote those that are flavored- naturally, or otherwise. 4. Offer more non-GMO options* (breads, pastries, spreads, dairy items, and meats).  *I prefer to bring a tiny dipping vessel full of organic almond butter from home to top the bagel with, instead of taking more of the staff's time and patience grilling them on what ingredients are used in their spreads.  I'm going to assume they contain allergenic ingredients I'd do well to skip."}
{"text":"Delicious large bagels and bialys that toast really well.  Great selection of sandwiches and homemade salads. Quick and very friendly service."}
{"text":"The Lox works was okay - overall the taste and ingredients was okay. The service is friendly but slow."}
{"text":"Great bagel sandwiches! The staff was very friendly and had great recomendations! And got our 6 free bagels through the app! Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"The softest , chewiest bagels  love walking over for a quick bagel sandwich . Wish they were open 24/7"}
{"text":"I work in the McCormick Plaza and my coworkers and I love coming to this local place! Really good bagels, although I have to say when I'm really hungry the breakfast burrito is my favorite! The eggs always taste like they're very freshly made. Service is always great and they always prepare your food quickly."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick breakfast on our way to Taliesin West.  My wife ordered an egg bagel with strawberry cream cheese and I opted for a breakfast burrito.  Her bagel was amazing, probably one of the best I've tried in years.  They had a great variety both of bagels and spreads.  The breakfast burrito was huge and quite tasty.  I wish though they had a half sized burrito as I ended up only needing about half of it.  It had a hefty price too at $7 but it was monster big.  We were disappointed in the coffee though.  My wife ordered an iced espresso mocha and it had a strong scorched taste.  I'm not sure if we caught them on a bad batch but it was enough of a disappointment to knock off a star for what is clearly a great local bagel joint.  Service was good and quick.  We were in and out in just minutes.  I definitely would recommend this place and would come back.  I'm certain the coffee is normally better."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick breakfast place before heading to the airport to fly back home and came across Lox, Stock & Bagel on Yelp. I am a big fan of bagels but have never heard of them so figured we'd check it out based on other positive reviews. I'm pleased we did!    I ordered the Hawaiian Bagel with honey almond cream cheese and a yogurt based raspberry fruit smoothie (because they don't offer chai tea lattes which are my hot morning drink of choice). The bagel had coconut and pineapple on the outside - top and bottom - and was super yummy!  The cream cheese spread was thick and obviously hand made because there were large pieces of sliced almonds in it. Yum!  And my smoothie was very good too. Better than I expected.   My bf ordered the egg, cheese, and bacon breakfast sandwich on a marble rye bagel. He thought it was outstanding because they were fresh made eggs and not frozen patties and the bacon was also nice and crisp. His only complaint was the extremely hot coffee that burned his mouth and took forever to cool down.   To sum it up; great bagels, lots of options, and freshly made food. Great quick breakfast!  Wish I had one near me in WI!"}
{"text":"Finally, a decent bagel! It may not be up to northeast standards, but pretty good for Scottsdale.This place has all varieties of bagels and toppings or sandwich makings you can think of. The 'everything' is terrific - well coated top and bottom with a flavorful mix. The place is neat and clean with very friendly service, and a good stop for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"These are the best bagels I have ever had in my life.  I have not been here personally, but a co-worker lives nearby and brings them in on Friday mornings. They are so fluffy and fat. I would like to go there myself to try other items on the meny. But as far as being a bagel shop, these guys got it right."}
{"text":"When I think of bagel places, I think of those deli like hole in the walls that are on every single corner in NY & NJ-where they fry the bacon and eggs right in front of you. Since arriving in AZ, my only options include Einstein bagels(not bad..but their egg sandwiches stink), Supermarket bagels (boo) and Dunkin Donuts, which are nowhere close to me to even be an option. This place is literally around the corner from my job. I had no idea it was in this strip mall (shocking). It feels like a real bagel place!! I had a wonderful poppy seed bagel with egg, bacon and provolone. It has some seating, is clean, and very friendly staff. Nothing out of the ordinary with the decor, but I'm so excited to find this place that I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Not impressed by this place. First of all, they were slow. How long does it take to pop a bagel in the toaster and schmear it?  But, my biggest quip with this place was ordering. The staff was simply rude to us. In addition to this, I wanted a bagel with cream cheese, lox, and tomato. They said that was going to be the item on their menu called \"the works\" which included that plus onion, black olive, pickle, and a side, none of which I wanted. Moreover, it was $11! Ludicrous. Food was average, and certainly not worth that much. We will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast.  Good bagels, decent bagel sandwiches although the fake eggs appeared to have a hint of green to them.  The egg salad sandwich was quite tasty with cucumber, tomato, onions and lettuce.  Cozy place with 8-12 seats available outside."}
{"text":"The bagels and pasteries here are delicious.  Maybe it's a good thing this place isn't closer to my house or I would eat here all the time.  Mmmm, carbs!  As Max said, it's not really a young, hip place to hang out but they make good eats.  Swing by and grab some bagels to go and be sure to pick up an amazing cranberry muffin.  I swear, they are like the size of your fist!"}
{"text":"I am surprised by all of these great reviews.  People comparing this place to bagels from New York.  No comparison whatsoever!  They lack any kind of flavor and the flavored cream cheeses barely contain anything to flavor them - very skimpy.  Great neighborhood atmosphere and I really wanted to love this place, but sadly will not return."}
{"text":"Bagel was great but found out at the register that I would have to pay a 50¢ surcharge for using a credit card. While I understand this policy it should be posted on the front door or someplace where you will see it before you order. Will make sure I have cash next time, don't want to pay 40% premium for a bagel."}
{"text":"Wow, you know it's bad service when staff complain \"it's a large order.\" Mediocre all around...horrible sour sauce on the pizza bagel, bland mayo land egg salad and chewy sad bagels and expensive too boot. Ugh. Pass."}
{"text":"Holy lord, this place has amazing breakfast burritos. Their bagels are good too. The crowd seems to be older - perhaps even senior. It's also not the coolest location ever. Still - if this is your neighborhood, this should be your bagel place. Beats the shit out of Einstein or Chompies. It's also worth a trip to check out their breakfast food. Actually - now that I mention it, I think I'm gonna hit it up this weekend.   I used to work at a bagel deli called Bagels De Lox - we had awesome bagels and sandwiches... I think if you have a clever name with \"Lox\" in it, you're probably good. This place rules."}
{"text":"I am originally from NJ via NY so I know what a bagel is supposed to taste like; or so I thought! This place now set the bar for what a perfect bagel should both look and taste like. First of all, these bagels are the biggest bagels in have ever had. They are always fresh and when eaten at the restaurant, there is never a need to have them toasted. They have all the standard flavors and then some. My personal favorite is the whole wheat mixed. I have them scoop the innerds so there are no calories . They make a great breakfast sandwich on a bagel with plenty of freshly scrambled egg and nice crisp bacon (if you ask for it) and your choice of cheese. The tuna and chicken salad are always fresh and tasty. They also make incredible potato salad! My mouth is watering just writing this review.  The staff is always friendly.  There are often Groupons and Restaurant.com savings.   For a great breakfast, give Lox, Stock a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the quality appears to have gone down over the last couple months.  The last two times I have been I've had a breakfast sandwich where the sausage was dry, eggs overcooked and the second time the bagel was moldy.  Hope they correct some of these things in the future."}
{"text":"Great food.  My favorite is the McCormick Club Sandwich.  Club sandwich on toasted sesame bagel--to die for!  And excellent prices."}
{"text":"These are the best bagels you can get in Phoenix. DJ's in Fountain Hills is a close second. It is the closest you can get to a true NYC bagel.  I typically get the bagels to go, though I know they have sandwich options for both Breakfast and Lunch. My favorite bagel is the Black Russian. Pumpernickel with Sesame Seeds."}
{"text":"Bagels were definitely as good as advertised.....and the breakfast bagel sandwich was delicious.....however, the coffee needs work....was lukewarm and weak. I'd recommend the bagels and breakfast to anyone but the coffee is mediocre."}
{"text":"This place was super cute! Got a whole grain bagel with farm fresh eggs, I thought it was pretty good. I also got a medium latte which I thoroughly enjoyed. My mom got a spinach and pesto bagel with farm fresh eggs and didn't like the flavor of it that much, but I thought it was okay. She also had no complaints about her small coffee. The staff was very professional and quick in getting our orders out."}
{"text":"No no no...all I have to say is no.  I may be picky but I won't be returning.  If bagel is in your name bagels are the thing you better do perfectly and although no one outside of NYC does it 100% right.  This is too far from it.  Sorry guys"}
{"text":"Not only are their bagels delicious, but they have THE BEST COFFEE in the valley, hands down.  Add a touch of cream and a little sweetener to their hazelnut vanilla brew or their breakfast blend for a slightly less sweeter version and it's practically HEAVEN in cup.  I'm not kidding.  I am a serious coffee drinker (couldn't tell ,could you?) and I am very picky.  So picky that before I discovered Lox, I would only drink the coffee that I made for myself at home because no one else's was good enough.  However, now that I have had the glorious coffee from Lox Stock & Bagel even my own coffee doesn't measure up.  I literally stop by and pick up a cup from there almost every day. YUMMMM!"}
{"text":"I had the b.e.l.t on a cheese asiago bagel very very good. Also used the six free bagel coupon. Very good tea as well. Top notch."}
{"text":"It was OK -  bagels nothing to write home about, place was dirty & I waited forever for a juice with our bagels.  I really like Big City Bagels MUCH better - best tasting bagels in AZ, simple clean place & quick, humble service."}
{"text":"Every few weeks a dear friend and I go to have bagels and lox. The bagels are good, the people are friendly. Lox: well, lox is lox as long as it's not smoked salmon from Alaska. I won't say much for the coffee, which doesn't really have much to recommend it or the cleanliness. But, if you're looking for a place to have that pleasant breakfast with an old friend, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"I've been the Duke here, off-and-on, for a few years now. It's in my neighborhood and is very convenient. I really really want this place to be good. Truth be told, under the new ownership, this place just isn't the same. My Friday group that used to meet here weekly rebelled on me because of bad onions and burned bagels.  (We've moved.) The vibe has changed too -- less cozy neighborhood deli, more grade school lunchroom.  The coffee continues to be fantastic, hence 2 stars. I keep going back in with hope that they'll straighten things out, but they can't get their act together.  When I was there on Tuesday, I almost ordered a fruit/yogurt parfait, but I noticed that the strawberries were clearly moldy on the first two parfaits I looked at -- I told the employee... As I left, it appeared the parfaits were still there. Not a good sign.  Sorry Lox Stock, you gotta step it up (and I'm not taking about the prices)."}
{"text":"This place used to have the best bagels hands down. I'm almost positive ownership has transferred because the quality of everything has gone way down. The customer service is poor and the bagels aren't even half as good as they used to be.  The bagels look like dinner rolls with heaping gobs of cream cheese on them. The store always seems dirty. I'm sorry to say we'll probably have to start going to Starbucks or Panera over our favorite bagel shop from now on. It's not worth the disappointment anymore."}
{"text":"Great gluten free bagels! I think they may Be from gluten free creations, but they are yummy nonetheless. And the tuna and egg salad are delicious! Wish they were open a little later."}
{"text":"I stop in when I want a quiet lunch and am craving lox. I've never ordered anything different beyond the lox special: bagel of your choice, cream cheese, lox, capers, onions, tomato, pickle, olives and your choice of side (potato salad, coleslaw, etc).   Today I stopped in for my usual. We also ordered a bagel with turkey and cheese. The woman who was working the front was nice, we ordered and then once she made our food she delivered it to our table. There was only one other person inside as we are, I like that it's usually mellow.   The lox hits the spot. You get to assemble it the way you want essentially, as they bring everything out on a platter. Potato salad is average. The turkey and cheese bagel was okay. This place is no frills though, basic tables and chairs, you come in to grab a quick bite to eat not to hang out. For me, it's more of a place to hide from the usual lunch spots my coworkers go to. If you just want a basic bagel and cream cheese I would think this would definitely deliver."}
{"text":"It's better than Noah's or Einstein brothers. A bit over priced if you ask me."}
{"text":"So I have to admit I love bagels for breakfast, lunch or dinner! I can honestly say I've never had a bad experience here! Great sun dried tomato with salsa cream cheese. Beats any other bagel joint in the city. (atleast the other ones I've been to) they have a lot to choose from even a delicious, gigantic breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Food was OK, just OK...coffee was ABYSMAL.  Price was borderline outrageous."}
{"text":"While searching for an ATM machine on Saturday night, we saw this place off in the distance.  Drove by it and it looked pretty cool so we decided we would come to it in the morning before we headed out of town.  I rarely see stand alone bagel shops anymore so we really wanted to try it.  Walked in around 10 and the place was happening!  Tons of people were eating their food there and a few were getting things to go.  They had a wide variety of bagels and they also had bialys.  I had heard the word \"bialy\" before but had no idea of what they were so I asked the super helpful lady at the counter.  She explained that they are like a bagel, less tasty, but more healthy.  She explained they are baked and made without sugar.  I decided to try a plain one of those and got 2 everything bagels too.  My wife got an onion bagel and a rye bagel both with cream cheese.  Total for everything was a little over $10.00.  Not bad for 5 bagels, 2 of them with cream cheese.  These things were HUGE!   Bonus points too.......the lady packed Ziploc freezer bags and twist ties in our bag to go just in case we weren't going to eat them right away.   That was some good looking out!  So how did they taste?......  Bialy-  Not bad but the lady was right.  It was kind of like eating a hard dinner roll almost.  It was decent but I don't know if I would get one again.  I would maybe get a flavored one instead of plain.  Next trip to Scottsdale I will let you guys know ;-)  Everything Bagel-  I had these when we got home for dinner.  They were awesome!  These things were massive yet they tasted great.  Sometimes you get a large bagel and its dried out and airy....not these things!  I had one with just butter and one with peanut butter and jelly.  They were really great and super filling.   I had a few bites of my wifes onion bagel too.  The onion bagel with cream cheese was really good.  Little tip here though that can save you a buck or two for you thrifty bastards ;-).  If you are buying 2 bagels and want cream cheese, only get one with cream cheese.  They slather these up with so much, you can scrape the excess off and use it on your other one.  You can then use that extra buck or two to tip the nice ladies that work here.  I would definitely come back here again when we go back to Scottsdale.  The girl taking care of us was super nice and helpful, the bagels were great and the price was decent.  Overall, a good shop to have around if you live in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I really don't know how to rate this place.  I went here this morning to pick up egg salad and bagels with a breakfast sandwich for my husband. ($28.00) I wanted to surprise my client who is a good customer of Lox Stock and Bagel.   The girl charged me $12.00 for 2 small containers of egg salad.  I questioned her on the price and she said that was correct.  I buy the best egg salad at AJ's for half that price.  We are not in NYC or Boston.  Get a grip on your prices  Lox Stock and Bagel.  All 3 employees were just having their own private conversation about delivering bagels somewhere.  This was my first and last experience there. I work to hard for my money!! I walked out of there feeling totally taken advantage of."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the great reviews or the $ rating for price as I got none of that.  The bagel I had was ok nothing to write home about, maybe I would have liked a bialy but there wasn't anything to explain to me what the difference between the two is.  The bagel was reasonably priced at $1.29 but the schmear of Cream Cheese set me back $3!  Just regular cream cheese, nothing fancy cost me $3.  Just butter is a $2 up charge.  So now I am in $4.29 for a bagel and cream cheese.  I also ordered a small Cesar salad which was another disappointment.  I don't know what their idea of Cesar dressing is but it just tasted like they poured oil and vinegar and some crunch cheese on my salad.  No other flavors besides oil and vinegar so it was not appetizing at all.  It was so oily looking that my breakfast companion noticed and asked about it. I ate two bites before I had to push it away.  My total for a small cesar, the bagel and cream cheese and a medium iced tea came to $13.  At first I thought maybe I had been double charged for something but in the end I realized that their prices were just that overpriced.  The odd part is their menu is on cupboard doors behind the cook line which doesn't sound like that big of a deal but the owner kept opening them to look for stuff and then would leave the door open and walk away.  I was trying to figure out what I wanted to order but at any given time half the menu was facing the opposite direction from me.  Maybe all the great reviews come from their regulars who can put up with this kind of crap."}
{"text":"I went here a couple weeks ago to use a Groupon I had bought. I used to go here as a kid, and the place lived up to my memories. The bagels were dense, but in a good way, and the cream cheese was delicious. I got an everything bagel egg and cheese sandwich and that was very tasty. The BF got a blueberry bagel and liked that too. There's just something special about deli bagels and cream cheese.... nothing like ones you can get from the store. Also, these bagels were even better than Chompie's bagels have been lately, so that's a good thing.  We also had their coffee, which I thought wasn't great, but wasn't terrible. Despite this, I will definitely be back the next time I feel like a bagel."}
{"text":"What a nice find in the midst of a shopping center.   I couldn't believe how clean the place looked and how fresh the food was! Bagels were on point with some bomb veggie cream cheese!   I had a breakfast burrito that would have been pictured but it was devoured so quickly! I have to say I was skeptical about ordering a breakfast burrito from a bagel joint but this burrito was great.  It was a giant burrito and put me into a food coma!   This place is a bagel shop on steroids."}
{"text":"I can't recall the last time I tasted a bagel this good. . .  PROS: service was prompt, and just ever so slightly abrupt, but in a manner that was in no way offensive--their message is efficiency and they are damn good at it. Two types of iced tea were much appreciated. The bagel? Slightly crunchy on the outside and fresh and chewy (in a good way) on the inside. Perfectly toasted. Wonderful flavor!  CONS: only one--they don't have a store near my home  Why can't we get bagels like this on the Central Coast of CA?   Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"Tasty food, but friendly tip to staff:  when somebody asks for \"turkey\", you should probably ask for clarification because apparently there are two completely different turkey bagels on your menu. ;-).  We got ended up with the wrong one. Also, staff were out of garlic bagels at 9:00am.  Plenty of other weird bagels though, but only a few actually go with turkey or lox."}
{"text":"Ive been going to Lox for years and have never been anything but satisfied! The bagels are always extremely fresh, even close to closing time!  The variety of cream cheeses just makes my mouth water thinking about it!! But if you want to get something more unique their many different kinds of breakfast sandwiches will always fill you up!!  Not to mention all kinds of drinks from Juice, Milk, Chocolate milk, soda, coffee and more! Why would you go anywhere else!  The service has always been top knotch! The family owned restaurant are the friendliest around; area for kids to play with legos, tables you can move for larger groups and FREE WI-FI!!!!"}
{"text":"I think the original owners have sold and what was once a well run, great place to go to get excellent bagels is no more...quality has gone out the window"}
{"text":".Great first experience, tried the breakfast bagel with egg, bacon and cheese, bear claw, raspberry muffin, the strawberry cheese spread and veggie cheese spread, and took advantage of the 6 free bagels thru Yelp check-in. Everything was great, staff was excellent. Surprised at the large menu of wraps, salads and sandwiches. Also impressed with the quick call back of voice message left. Check it out, a great place with great people."}
{"text":"The fresh-baked bagels here are spectacular.  At the time of our visit, there was a check-in deal that resulted in 10 free bagels of your choice with purchase of an entree, which led to many happy (although probably not too healthy) breakfasts ranging from chocolate bagels to garlic bagels.  I would happily return to have the bagels again.  Each one we tried had a unique, tasty flavor. When we came here, though, we tried to get fancy and ordered breakfast sandwiches consisting of egg, cheese and bagels.  They weren't spectacular, unfortunately.  I'm not sure whether it was the style of the egg (it tasted and looked like an egg-blend patty) or what, but I wasn't a fan.  A recognizable fried or poached egg on top of a bagel with a yolk of some form would have been much better.  I also tried a latte, which tasted almost sour.  Definitely recommend sticking to what this place does best - killer bagels."}
{"text":"The bagels are fresh and delicious and very well might be the best in town. The restrooms and dining area are clean, the service is friendly but a little slow. Since this place is a hit among the locals, the wait can get long and the dining area can get crowded. There is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Family business bagel shops are my favorite.  I found this place through Groupon and decided to check it out.  The name itself intrigued me as Lox means salmon fillet that is cured.  I didn't go with salmon, but I got a honey wheat bagel with veggie lite cream cheese.  The cream cheese was freshly made with carrots, garlic, and celery.  It had a light taste to go with a healthy and hearty sized bagel.  My friends got croissants with cheese which tasted delicious as well.  The prices are very reasonable here and you can order bagels by the dozen."}
{"text":"My boss picks these up for work from time to time. I've never been to the location, but these people make a mean ass bagel. It's good, best one I've had in the valley. They're super soft even after sitting on the counter all day. Blueberry is by far the best.  When you get them to go, they're even smart enough to put the 'everything' bagel's in their own bag so the sunflower and poppy seed bits don't get all over the others.  Good ish."}
{"text":"This was my favorite bagel joint. I was excited to come in since I haven't been in a while only to be disappointed w my green eggs and ham bagel. The eggs were just gross, green colored and the texture was that of some sponge type. I was very disappointed this morning."}
{"text":"Great bagels and sandwiches. Wonderful people there also. For the first check in we got six free bagels. They are great. Very fluffy compared to most other places where it feels like your jaw is giving out chewing up one. Their bagels are good both toasted and not.   Recommended for sure."}
{"text":"Really good bagels, friendly owners and workers, and clean too. I really enjoyed listening to the owner wandering around visiting with customers and their children. If you bring your children I think I saw a little lego'style play area. We had the deluxe lox and bagel breakfast and it was quite tasty. Loved the old-timey pics on the wall near the bathroom. This place smells warm and cozy and a little bit New York from the moment you walk in the door. Oh, and the cinnamon crunchy bagel chips were just this side of heaven."}
{"text":"If you're Gluten Free, you must try their GF bagels! They make a wonderful vessel for their cream cheese! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Never again will I go in this place, the prices are outrageous. I ordered one bagel and I asked for about a tablespoon of cream cheese, figured how much could that be, she says $3.29! Never again, I should of went to the grocery store this bagel is not even that good."}
{"text":"This is the place for bagels in Scottsdale. Great variety and excellent menu. Great prices."}
