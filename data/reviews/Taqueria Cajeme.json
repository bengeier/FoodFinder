{"text":"I love love love the tacos de camaron empanizando  great food great service and I also love the tostadas de ceviche mmm definitely  recommend"}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp cocktail. It was $14. I felt it was small, there were hardly any vegetables or shrimp. There was more tomato juice than anything else. I also ordered a steak burrito. It had a nice flavor, good. Last item was horchata. Bill total... $26. I'm only this disappointed because of the picture they have posted of their cocktail. It looks fantastic! It's just not :(   the staff was friendly and the restaurant looked clean. I might go back to try some other items one day"}
{"text":"Where do I start, the service is horrible! We ordered two simple plates. I chose the cheese enchiladas they brought me chicken enchiladas, no big deal. But when she brought back the correct order the sauce was HOT. I personally love spicy food but it was unbearable I had to get it boxed. I've had it multiple times was never like that. They purposely did something to the sauce on my plate. While we were eating we looked over and the servers were putting TAP WATER into the ketchup bottles. We were visited twice during the visit. The total was $47 for two entrees. Not worth it"}
{"text":"I've only had the Mexican style hotdogs here, but they were delicious! They come bacon-wrapped with grilled onions, tomatoes, sour cream, and some other tasty stuff I can't remember. Haven't tried the other offerings, but I'm sure they're good as well."}
{"text":"Good food 
Bad Service 
Dirty Place"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican tacos, you've hit the jackpot! Yeah they're on the pricier side, but definitely worth it! Waitresses are all nice and very attentive. My boyfriend had the coctel with shrimp and octopus and it had great flavor. Although be forewarned all ye who are afraid of spice because their salsas are equal parts flavor and heat. 

They also have freshly made drinks that are refreshing!"}
{"text":"Comida genérica Cajemense, la manta estaba sobre cocida (aguada), aguamole, micheladas de medio litro de Clamato (No se puede saborear la cerveza) el lugar está muy encerrado y al estar lleno causa eco y se vuelve muy ruidoso. Si regresas comida que está mala, te la cobran de cualquier forma, abusados al pagar.  

Decoración x dentro está acondicionada con pinturas de Cd. Obregón, baños con un charcote en el puro centro del piso, meseras carecen conocimiento de lo que venden. 

Los bichis están buenos y la cervezas bien frías, comimos Toritos, chile sobre cocido y extremadamente grasoso, llegamos con las expectativas muy en alto, fue una decepción."}
{"text":"This is the closest Taqueria to my new home, so on a Sunday bike ride, I wanted to give it a try.  They let me park my bike in the front area and seated me at the front area along a tall and long table, which I loved!  (I like to sometimes be able to stand up and eat or stretch.  Complimentary chips and a house salsa which was outstanding!  They also had a nice condiment bar with a real pico de gallo that included some chunks of jalapeno.  (Not just tomato and a little onion, in the \"gringo\" places!) 

Ordered the \"small\" tacos and selected the cabeza (beef cheek meat) and a version of birria tacos.  Each set was served on fresh (homemade) corn tortillas that were of good size.  The tacos had a great portion of meat on them!  (I was thinking I could have ordered 3 instead of 4.)  The cabeza meat was so flavorful, and not with the chunks of fat (or dripping grease) that some places carelessly leave in.  Absolutely outstanding and at $1.75 each, quite a bargain!  I don't understand the reviews for this place $$$$ unless there were issues previously, that have obviously since been corrected.  

The restaurant had plenty of tables, half of which were occupied by medium to larger families (enjoying Sunday lunch) and it was just awesome to see!  Hard working waitresses and staff working back in the kitchen.  This will be my go-to taco place for sure!!!"}
{"text":"So this place is kind of awkward.. We walked in and there was a guest at his table pretty faded playing his guitar. He wasn't a employee, just someone having lunch and hanging out. There is no host podium, or anyone to tell you what to do so for about 5 min we awkwardly stood near the door. They finally told us to just sit anywhere. We ordered our drinks and my soda came in a can. So gotta buy each one separately. The set up was very awkward, no ambience. The waitress is no where to be found after she takes your order. They finally brought our food which was decent for a dive (Most Mexican dive places have the best). I sat without a drink until I walked over to the waitress who was chit chatting with a couple other girls and asked for another. Mexican food places out here in mesa are a dime a dozen, so I would have thought they would try to up their game. Unfortunately it was a fail, aside from the food being decent, the waiting and awkward kind of dirty feel to the place was too much."}
{"text":"I ordered the cóctel de camarón it was very delicious- packed with jumbo shrimp. My husband the the gorditas he says they were good but a little on the small side."}
