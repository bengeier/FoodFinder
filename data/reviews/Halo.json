{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and food. By far our favourite restaurant when we come to Calgary. Steak was perfect, saganaki good and salads are excellent.  Great selection on menu and prices very reasonable.  A hidden gem as always room when we show up."}
{"text":"The service was really great but the food was not very good. I had the calamari and it wasn't the best, pretty bland. For an entree I had the rack of lamb and it was so salty and fatty that I couldn't even eat it. Too bad because the place is beautiful and the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"Right from the start the service was not satisfactory. We were sat in the lounge without the Option of the dining room. The starter soup was watery and bland and the bread was hard and stale. I ordered the prime rib medium rare, but was served an end piece dipped in Au jus that was very over cooked and unevenly cut and difficult to chew. My partner ordered a 16 oz ribeye that was over cooked, very thin, and awful in colour. We received nothing but excuses about the economy being bad and them having to cut back to thinner steaks. We received rude remarks from the owner who was very unprofessional and unwilling to hear what was wrong with the food and the service. Instead of an apology after what was an unnecessarily long and heated argument he stormed off leaving the less than average performing server to deal with the issue. We will not be returning and do not recommend dining in this overpriced and unprofessional establishment."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend out for a celebratory dinner and we had a great time.  service was great food was almost great,  way better than good but not quiiiiite excellent,  although the cheesecake was excellent.  I had the stuffed salmon, the stuffing wasn't my absolute favorite but the sauce was great and the salmon cooked nicely. veg and potatoes were a good side.  I had the hyper monkey cocktail which was delish and my boyfriend had the hang ten which was not my favorite but he liked it."}
{"text":"Service was very good but the good stopped there. My husband and I both had the filet mignon which was chewy, veiny and completely unseasoned. The baked potato tasted old - like it had been sitting all day and just microwaved. We expected much more than this for the price. We have been to Halo a few times over the years but this will definitely be our last."}
{"text":"Don't go for Sunday brunch it's horrible .. Got the steak and eggs for 18 bucks , I don't think I've ever been served eggs broken with the yolk running all over the plate already , I like to break my own yolks thank you .  Hash browns were cold ,and they only give you one piece of toast ( also a first ) had to order a second piece .Steak was ok but very small .  My wife ordered the Benny .. Rock hard eggs , cold hash browns and literally one tbsp of hollandaise dribbled over the two Benny's .they are taking cheap to a new level if they break your egg on the grill you getting it anyway and no one needs two pieces of toast that's just greedy .  I don't understand these guys in these tough times it's like they just don't care and don't figure they even gotta try but I won't be back and that's how you lose a business one customer at a time ."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst place to eat in Calgary. I had a horrible dinner in their last location but decided to give it another try. The service was not bad, a little slow but at least she was friendly. Only one other table of 4 were in the place for lunch. A red flag right there. I ordered the calamari and had to spit it out. There was something wrong with it and when i mentioned it to the server she did inform the kitchen. She came back saying they couldnt take it off the bill and that they thought it was just fine. My steak was extremely small and tough. At least the server took it upon herself to remove the calamari from the bill in the end. Quite frankly I cant believe the place is still open. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time at halo. If your looking for a really delicious steak I wouldn't recommend this place. My boyfriend had the New York strip and I had the halibut. The strip was bland, my halibut was dry and bland as well. It's a great place to go for drinks they were AMAZING (halo heaven) desert was ok. The service was awesome and it has a nice atmosphere. I would go back but only for a night out with drinks."}
{"text":"Just went to the new location. Sat in the lounge, newly renovated. Beautiful but no ambience. Our waiter Jordie was excellent, the food however wasn't. Had to return a $36 rib eye steak twice. Came to the table rare at first, they took it back then brought back the same steak over done. The second time it was a terrible unseasoned cut of meat. Very stringy and again not cooked right. When asking the manager on hand to take it back he replied by saying \"try the other side\". Our bill was discounted, the item was not removed which was disappointing. Needless to say we won't be going back. If you consider yourself a steak house the steak should be the best thing cooked to perfection on the menu."}
{"text":"I was disappointed.  Service and atmosphere were fine but food was bland and lacking inspiration.  We had a strip loin and basa.  We cold do better at home or a lot less than $80.  I knew we were in trouble when sat with a good view of the kitchen and the only appliance in view was a microwave."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the new location and finally went recently. What a major step down from the 'house' location. It's not as cozy without the fireplace, it's louder, has more booths instead of their awesome leather high back chairs, the staff are more casual than before and the maitre d' ! He bit off the head of the nice server, in front of us, telling him to switch up tables because we were early and had an argument about which tables to switch and how to do it. We just kind of shuffled out of the way as we began to feel uncomfortable.  Then the meal... My filet mignon was fabulous, but his prime rib was tough! Could barely eat half and he even had to spit out a chunk. The lobster tail which were on special were ... Moldly. You know that early mold that you can't smell but can just taste. Dessert - we had the ice cream cake which was frozen so hard we had to get a steak knife and a fork just to pierce it.   Not going back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch about 3 weeks ago.  Ordered a calamari app which the first couple of bites were just so-so.  Personally I like crispy batter and this was very soggy batter.  Seemed in bag frozen but can't say for sure.  well on the third bite, my girlfriend spit hers out and said there was something disgusting on it.  She said it seemed like soap or bleach.  A chemical taste.  When we informed the waitress, she was quite nice but then returned to tell us that the kitchen would make us another batch of  calamari but they wouldn't take it off the bill.  The steak sandwiches were okay but even if they'd been amazing it wouldn't have helped the sad experience.  When the bill came, the waitress explained that she had taken it upon herself to take the appy off the bill (good for her!) but sadly the damage was done by management.  I hope she gets a good job when this place closes."}
