{"text":"My new favourite place for beef noodles! Noodles taste very fresh, beef is tender and tendons aren't too tough or chewy. The broth as well was not too strong or too salty so that made me even happier as the broth everywhere else is excessively salted. As others have said, the smell of stinky tofu emanates from the front door and is overpowering inside but I have gotten used to it. Highly recommend to anyone that love beef noodles and can handle the smell."}
{"text":"I use to come here more often andI forgot why.  So i made a special  trip.


I order the  beef noodle and tendon along with a side order of sticky tofu.



I was expecting more from the beef.  But it was good but I was underwelmed.   The beef tendon was good though. 


Hand made noodles was a little under cooked.

Tofu    was great as usual. 



Over it was an ok experience but I use to love the place inside First market place that closed ten years ago.   Then opened up at leslie and 16 th for about a year.   That was the best beef noodles in town"}
{"text":"Two things that go together beautifully are beef tendon noodles and stinky tofu. This place isn't for the faint of heart, it literally smells like feet (sorry!) when you're outside or sitting in the restaurant but the crispy stinky tofu tastes so good in your mouth! The noodles are delicious too, it seems like they make the noodles from scratch  as they aren't all uniform in size or shape. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The smell will punch your nostrils right away, the moment you step inside. The smell of their washroom is literally better. Their noodles are on the mediocre side. The service was okay. Will not go again. Sorry."}
{"text":"great place for taiwanese beef noodles at a reasonable price.  the scent of smelly tofu permeates the air...whether or not you like it is another question.  the preserved egg with tofu is quite good.  dont bother ordering the veggie dishes as i found them bland."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant when it first opened as I am a huge fan of beef noodle soup.  For those that are not familiar with beef noodle soup, when done right it has one of the richest tasting broths bound to satisfy anyone who has an affinity for strong flavor.  

The beef noodle soup is decent with the strong flavor that I have come to expect.  There are different ways this soup noodle is made, some are oily and others are just spicy.  This place does it right, not too oily and not too spicy.  Nothing I haven't tasted before but well done nonetheless.  So why the 2 star review? Well it's pretty obvious if you've read some of the other reviews.  

For those not familiar with stinky tofu it is one of the foulest smelling foods out there.  I would describe it is as Chinatown sewer smell mixed with feces combined with a sneeze from someone who has bad breath.  When you enter the restaurant you are taken aback by the smell - woosh.  I like to consider myself an  open minded person so I thought I would get used to the smell over time, boy was I wrong.  This place could be a \"Fear Factor' episode.    

I'm sorry, I don't care how good the food tastes.   To me enjoyment of ones food requires satisfaction of all senses, anything else becomes a distraction. If Gordon Ramsay was making his signature dish and I had to eat it in a Chinatown bathroom next to a guy taking a dump in a stall I think I would be distracted and would likely not taste as good as if I were eating it in one of his restaurants.  Perhaps it is not the same thing but to me it came close.  

I'll end this review by saying if you are here for the beef noodle soup, it is decent but there are other places you can obtain the same flavor without the smell of Chinatown sewer, feces and bad breath.  If you have OCD you will definitely be distracted and the food will be an afterthought as the only thing that will be on your mind is how great it will feel to be able to breath again.  Now ask yourself which other place do you normally experience this.  Yep, not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Good fried tofu, noodles are average."}
{"text":"Soup is good, meat is good, tendon is good. Basically everything is great except the smell. I guess for people who love stinky tofu, the smell is welcoming. But we just can't stand the smell."}
{"text":"I was a little sceptical at first because of the exterior, but was pleasantly surprised when I went inside. The interior was very warming and welcoming. The service was also very fast and helpful. The menu at first looked disappointing, but to my surprise the food exceeded all of my expectations. The food was probably the best Chinese food I've had in a long time. If you're in the area I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The amount of food in takeout is pathetic. Good food, that is not in doubt, but dining in and taking out are so different that I really wouldn't visit them again. Come on, there are so many good places next to the restaurant."}
{"text":"my order is large size beef noodle, it's quite good Taiwanese beef noodle for lunch, and vegetables were good. I like it and will visit it again. Parking was easy, not the rush hour. The service is nice."}
{"text":"It's a restaurant either you love it or hate it. I don't like the stinky tofu, but the whole restaurant smells like it. The noodles here tastes really good."}
{"text":"Probably deserves a 3.5 star rating.

A wonderful beef soup smell greeted us when we entered the restaurant.  I ordered a beef and tendon noodle soup.  It did not disappoint - the beef and tendon were wonderfully tender and the noodles were done al dente.    We had two appetizers (pig ears and bamboo shoots) but noticed that most of the other tables were ordering the stinky tofu.  Maybe next time...  

Despite the yummy taste, I had to dock off points for the loads of MSG used in the broth.  Both my partner and I got that dry-mouthed sensation after eating at Mei Nung.  Not pleasant, and while I understand the uses of MSG, I personally don't prefer it in my food.  

Service was fast and curt, but not unpleasant.  Would go back again, but would arm myself with watermelon juice afterwards to quench the MSG-induced thirst."}
{"text":"Yummy beef noodles, and the stinky tofu is pretty awesome.  Nicely fried.  Price is very reasonable!"}
{"text":"It's ok. The rating on yelp is not real. U can get better noodles soup somewhere. The broth is not flavourful. The service is bad. It is not authentic. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"A hearty bowl of noodle that I crave once awhile. It simply hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"Came here on thursday evening after work. If you're looking for a place with good noodles, this is the place. The noodles are really delcious, it's small cozy restaurant. If you're ok with the smell of stinky tofu, give this place a try. As a tip, they are closed on tuesdays. Will be back again for beef noodles!"}
{"text":"Delicious stinky tofu and beef noodle at an (slightly higher now) affordable price. The restaurant is packed so be sure to go early or you'll end up waiting 15-20 min. Service is fast and accommodating however they only take cash so be prepared"}
{"text":"This place has great stinky tofu, unfortunately everything else is just ok.

Also they suck at communicating, instead of one type of noodle ordered, they brought us two. In addition to the other five dishes we ordered, annoying paying for stuff not ordered. 

And my friend found a bug in her noodle soup. That was gross.

I'd only return for the tofu."}
{"text":"Terrible (non existent) service and the beef noodle soup tasted too sour. The place smelled terrible too. Would not recommend. There are much better noodle places elsewhere. Eaters beware. Don't be fooled by the reviews. This was the first restaurant that I will never eat again and my SO agreed too that it tasted awful. It was that terrible that I had to write a review about. Oh and btw there was a small fly in my SO's noodle."}
{"text":"Beef noodle soup: The soup is just the right flavour. The taste is rich but not overly salted. The noodles are cooked al dente -- the bite is much firmer than the typical factory-made noodles. The noodle soup really fills the stomach even though the bowl may not look as impressive in size as a typical pho."}
{"text":"I like the beef noodle soup here, it has a strong beef flavour. 

However, I tried the noodles in the sauce/paste once and I was grossed out. It was good at first, but once I finished half my bowl, it started getting really gross. It felt like I am eating a dense paste and I just couldn't finish it. I actually felt like barfing.

So I don't get the noodles in the sauce/paste anymore. I just stick to the usual noodles in soup.

This is a cheap and fast restaurant if you are in the area"}
{"text":"I visited Mei Nung Beef Noodle House with a party of 6. We each ordered our own beef noodles and had the stinky tofu to share.

Beef noodles: The soup was flavourful, but I found the beef quite tough. Noodles were chewy - just the way I like it!

Stinky Tofu: The restaurant did smell because of the stinky tofu (so be prepared for that!). The texture was good and the hot sauce on the side accompanies the dish really well.

We were seated in the corner so it was difficult for the servers to see us. The perk of our visit was that we were able to get a small % off our bill for checking-in on yelp!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Their soup base tastes like watery soy sauce. The aroma of the beef is missing. However, for people who have not tasted good quality beef noodle soup in Taiwan -- they will probably think this place is good."}
{"text":"Gee Wally, the food is swell...but what is that strange odor.

My first minute entering the restaurant, there is a fairly strong odor from the stinky tofu.  Soon, the smell becomes the norm and the fragrant tofu is no longer evident.  Now without the distraction...to the food.  I ordered the large beef noodle and side order of dumplings.  Don't recall the prices but everything was affordable.

The beef noodles came out extremely hot, just the way I like it.  The soup is tasty but not overly salty.  For those who want a good bowl of beef noodles, this place should not be overlooked.  Portions are large and fulfilling.  Thought I needed a side of dumplings as I was very famished.  Bad idea, the large order of noodles was more than enough to satisfy my hunger.  The dumplings were average but a very good deal.   I will be back when I'm craving their beef noodles....maybe I will try their very popular stinky tofu on my next visit."}
{"text":"I've been to this place three times, and the beef noodle soup is some of the best that you can get in Toronto! The noodles are homemade, so they have a great chew and they are thick, which is excellent. The beef is tender and the soup has a tang to it that comes from the pickled mustard. I definitely recommend a large if you are a big eater, but the regular size is suitable for most.

They also have some side dishes; the ones I tried were the preserved egg with tofu and the stinky tofu. The preserved egg is good, but you may find it a bit salty with the sauce and bonito flakes. The stinky tofu has a great smell, and it tastes pretty good also. I would avoid the black bean sauce noodle though, as the sauce isn't special and the dish is pretty small compared to the noodle soup.

Overall, this is an excellent place to have lunch and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Cost: very reasonable - $
Quality: very good - 85%
Decor: average - 80%
Staff: average to almost no service - 70%
Value: 85%

Keeper? Yes we go there regularly. 
Be forewarned that if you can't stand the smell of stinky tofu, you either have to:
A. avoid this place completely, or
B. trust me or at least trust your body that after 5 mins you will have completely adapted and won't smell it anymore
If you do like stinky tofu, I think you will like theirs."}
{"text":"Hot diggity damn!  Taiwan-style beef noodle with fresh, house made noodles!  I serious hope this becomes the next food craze now that ramen's finally hit T.O's streets.

I come in with a buddy after longingly walking past this place the past few months.  Wife's a vegetarian so there was never an opportunity to chow down on my homeland's nuclear bomb of noodle soups.  Finally, I get the chance to have lunch sans wifey, I recruit a friend and I'm there as the resto opens.

I sit down, crack open the menu and I proceed to gross out my buddy with suggestions about getting some stinky tofu, pigs ears, etc.  The began to fill up so we get serious and order two beef noodle soups.  We noticed that the two tables around us get their food first even though we ordered before them and my buddy privately cracks a joke about getting screwed over for being half-laowai.

Food finally comes and I get transported back to TW or at least Vancouver, the last place I had this kind of beef noodle soup.  Broth was rich and a bit lacking on the star anise side.  Slapping on some hot sauce fixed that and I was in noodle heaven."}
{"text":"In our search for Taiwanese food that comes as close to being in Taiwan as possible, this place is definitely a front runner in the GTA. My S/O is from Taiwan and she gave it two thumbs up especially the beef noodle (either dry or in soup). And I have to agree, the noodles are homemade and has a chewy texture like how good homemade noodles should be. The beef portions are generous and extremely tender. Not a lot of options but they do have a lot of variations of beef noodle soup. We also tried some of their cold appetizers which were very refreshing and the infamous stinky tofu and found that to be very good as well, I'd say almost as good as Wei's. The spot is at First Markham Place, if there is a wait, be patient as turnover is usually pretty fast."}
{"text":"Took a client here twice now, and had an enjoyable time. The cocktails were great, and I highly recommend the Beef Noodle Soup, it's the signature dish.  Not an everyday splurge, but a great place to take someone special or for a fun business dinner."}
{"text":"Had their beef noodle soup three times. I wanted to give them a chance but their broth has no taste at all. Their beef noodle soup does not come close to tasting like one"}
{"text":"The food is good. But they only accept cash, which is very inconvenient. They should at least accept debit card. The bank charged me $5 for taking cash at the ATM for $20, the owner should put a sign said\" Cash Only\". It's very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years now to get my stinky tofu fix. The stinky tofu tastes just like the carts on the streets in Taiwan. Best in town. The beef noodles are just as good! Usually get the large beef tendon. The small appetizers are good and veggies come in a good portion for the price. Pretty much everything on the menu is good. Try the preserved duck egg with tofu too. 

I get excited just talking about this place!"}
{"text":"Beef noodles and stinky tofu are a must try. Broth is a bit salty but still fits with the handmade noodles and beef. Reasonably priced but not comfy enough with small kids."}
{"text":"This is the place to be for authentic Taiwanese noodles and stinky tofu. But I have to warn people that can not stand the smell of stinky tofu then this is not the place for you. This is my regular place for the Taiwanese minced pork noodle and braised beef noodle.  I still can't find a place better then this place in the GTA for taiwanese noodles. Prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"menu was kind of limited, though probably because they specialize in noodles, I'm more of a rice person but the food was good and serving sizes were generous

we went primarily for the stinky tofu that was recommended by a friend and it turned out incredibly delicious, served on a huge plate"}
{"text":"I actually think this place has a pretty decent broth for their beef noodles! Their noodles are good as well if you like them chewy. I went there twice with my mom and we both loved it so much that we decided to bring dad along the third time.
Rating-wise, their food is ok. I can't say it's the best I've ever had, but it was good enough that you'd come back for it.
I gave them a low score because I don't think they're very honest. My dad went up to the counter to pay and when he got his change, he was slipping the coins into his wallet and a $5 bill fell out from his hand. Dad thought he saw something fall behind him from the corner of his eye, but he was already walking back to the table. He turns around and sees one of the waitresses picking something up from the ground and tossing it behind the counter. He didn't realize it was his $5 bill until he got to the table and wanted to slip the bill in his wallet too.
The waitress then acted natural and started clearing our table so we would get out quickly. 
I guess maybe I should give them 2 stars since it's partially my dad's fault for not confronting her right away. If only he told us before we left the restaurant, I would have said something. 
I give them a tiny bit of doubt -- maybe they didn't know who dropped it or something... but I don't think so.
Honestly, it's just $5, but it reflects on how a business treats their customers. I would never want to come back to a restaurant that would even cheat $5 from their customers. (And we didn't leave them a lousy tip to begin with because we were originally very happy with their service!)"}
{"text":"The noodles are made just right. But the place smells like so much ass... I am personally not a stinky tofu person, but I will deal with it for good noodles."}
{"text":"I'm so glad a friend showed me this area. Eating here made me feel happy like I just went to Taiwan. I felt like food was as close to having local food in taiwan. The udon was just as I expected, soft. the beef broth was rich. The tofu with Aged Egg was so good. The stinky tofu with fermented vegetables were good. I felt like i ate a fairly balanced meal here. The green vegetable that looked like Chinese broccoli in the picture was not Chinese broccoli but I highly recommend it. There were 4 of us i felt like that was a perfect number because each of us spend $10 each. we shared 2 Large bowls of Beef broth soup, an order of stinky tofu, an order of the green sauteed vegetable that looked like Chinese Broccoli, and an order of aged egg and tofu. Between two guys and two ladies, we were full. I know that im going to come back to this place because i will crave the soup, stinky tofu, veggie and aged egg tofu. 
I just went yesterday for the first time and I can't stop thinking about it (especially the beef and tendon).
Be sure to check in and get your 10% off, thats what made the range $10/person.
I want to try the dumplings next time."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, the stinky tofu makes the restaurant smell but you get use to it after about 15 minutes. I normally just go for the beef noodles with their hand made thin noodles. The noodles and beef are amazing. The only thing bad is the service sometimes when it gets too busy."}
{"text":"We always come here to have their signature beef noodle. It never disappoints and is consistent with their quality. Will come again whenever I crave noodles and want to eat fast. 

Food:
Home made signature beef noodle is good in a yummy beefy soup broth. The noodle is always served piping hot and the noodles have a nice al dente chewy texture which is good. Good portion of noodles, beef, bok choy and preserved vegetable. Can tell it's homemade and not salty. 

Service:
Good and fast service."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best noodle places in Markham. There is however a very peculiar smell when you walk in of the stinky tofu - it seems to be very popular here. I order the house special and it's perfect every time. The service is what you'd expect at a Chinese restaurant and does not bother me. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Again. Delicous...and sooooo stinky
price is reasonable....is quite far from my home but it worth the drive"}
{"text":"Worse than most of the beef noodle I tried in Shanghai. Wondering why the rating is so high..."}
{"text":"I was pretty into this place! The noodles taste just like they came off the side of the street in China. Broth is amazing. The prices have since changed ($1-2 increase) from the pics on this Yelp page, but I felt the prices were fair. 

Would come back here."}
{"text":"I can boldly state that this place has the best Taiwanese Beef Noodles in the GTA (that I've tried). Don't let the odorous stinky tofu discourage you from entering their doors! 

They have many options to choose from: Dried noodles, noodles in soup or beef, beef tendon or just plain beef broth. Their noodles are very nice and chewy - great for people like me who likes texture. The beef is tender, and never rough or stuck between my teeth! Hooray for that. The noodles are usually topped with pieces of bok choy, and a smidgen of pickled diced veggies. 

Their stinky tofu is honestly just fried tofu with the stink. I find the sauce that accompanies it to be too salty, but I love the pickled cabbage it comes with. I would also skip the cold appetizers like: tofu w/ thousand year old egg or the pig ears. 

They don't do this anymore, but I used to add dumplings to my beef noodle soup. They are the best dumplings ever. Seriously. The skin is thick but just as chewy as the noodles, and the insides are filled with juice - Almost like a XLB (xiu long bao). You can purchase frozen dumplings to make at home too! 

There's usually a line during dinner time, even on weeknights. The wait will be worth it!"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best noodle texture in the world! Just hard enough to be chewy yet soft enough for soup noodle. The beef is also very tender and juicy. Amazing smelly tofu on top!!"}
{"text":"After recently having an amazing hand pulled noodle at Lan Zhou Noodles in Montreal I thought I would renew my search for great hand pulled noodles in Toronto.  

After looking at reviews in Yelp, I thought I would give this place a try.  Overall I think that the food was average.  The noodle had a strange consistency...too firm and chewy.   The broth was okay.  IMO Chinese Halal Restaurant still the best in class in GTA

I will continue my search in GTA..."}
{"text":"As soon as you enter, you're hit with the fragrance of dirty dish rag. No, not stinky tofu as people on Yelp think it is - this is definitely dirty dish rag and is the same smell from other Chinese restaurants that do not have stinky tofu. I saw the waitress wipe down the table with the same cloth she used to wipe the mouth of the soya sauce bottles.

This place used to be good, but it seems to have been sold to non-Taiwanese. How do I know? Well, they don't speak Cantonese in Taiwan. Second, the sign says knife-cut noodle, but their noodles are clearly squeezed through a spaghetti maker. The noodles aren't bad, but they just aren't authentically Taiwanese.

The beef and the broth is decent, though. Although, they put in waaay too much beef, waaay too much noodle and hardly any soup! We also ordered the shuijiao - the skin was so thick, like a rhinoceros hide. Even the crappy street stalls in Taiwan have better shuijiao. Also, they didn't have crushed garlic or sesame oil for the dipping sauce?!?! Not authentic at all. All I saw on the table were Canto-style condiments; nothing Taiwanese.

And the last straw? Cash only. Not even a debit machine. I had to walk to the plaza to withdraw money."}
{"text":"I came here for stinky tofu and I think it was alrite. The only thing that their sticky tofu is better than other places is the sauce, I guess....

I also ordered the beef noodles, and it was pretty good...

If you are not a fan of stinky tofu smell, don't come to this place cuz it will make your cloths stink for the rest of the day..."}
{"text":"A solid 4. The hardest part is the first five minutes. After that, you become one with the pungent scent of stinky tofu and don't notice it at all (except when someone opens the door, which allows the air to circulate). We (crew of three) arrived here for lunch shortly after 12:30 and were seated immediately. A quick browse through menu and we were presented with our food. For me, this was a small bowl of Homemade Beef & Beef Tendon Noodle Soup (which looked more or less exactly like it did in the picture), and a plate of deep fried stinky tofu to share (because... why else would we come here?).

I am a big fan of the noodles, which were chewy and had just the right amount of bite. The chewiness was also consistent throughout the entire bowl. The amount of brisket that I got was pretty good - probably three or four pieces, each about 1 cm thick. The brisket was tender and easy to separate, but the real winner for me was the beef tendon. The tendon was masterfully cooked, with the outside being soft and gooey, and just ever so slightly firmer towards the middle of the tendon. There was no \"bite\", or hardness in the middle of the tendon - which would have indicated underdoneness. The flavour of the broth was quite mellow, with sweet undertones, mixed with a savouriness (savouriness, not saltiness). I would guess that some of the flavours are imparted from star anise, but I really can not fathom what else went into it (initially, the first taste reminded me of cinnamon). Either way, definitely recommend this bowl of noodles.

The stinky tofu is something that you should try at least once. I mean, why not? You're probably going to smell like it all day anyway. We received a large plate of tofu, piping hot out of the fryer, with a generous amount of sauce drizzled on top. The tofu had a very faint grey / green shade to it (think Asian blue cheese) and tastes slightly like it smells. The taste is undoubtedly acquired, but I wouldn't describe it negatively. The first time that I had it here, I would have said that it had the flavour of sour wine, but this time, it is unquestionably clear that this could only be described as stinky tofu. That said, I couldn't stop myself from having more as the crispy tofu, with some chili sauce must have made something in my head say \"hey, this is pretty good\".

So, would I come back? Yes. Cheap, tasty food (especially the tendon). Pro tip: Not recommended for a first date (unless it's going poorly to begin with)."}
{"text":"Their noodles are handmade. The bounciness of the noodles was just right but the soup is on the salty side. Beware, the place smells like stinky tofu, which we ordered. Verdict? Mehhhh"}
{"text":"I was just wandering the neighborhood and had a craving for beef noodle soup and after consulting Yelp I ended up here. 

The beef noodle soup is so good the broth is delicious and handmade noodles are the perfect type of chewy. Kind of like the texture of udon but more al dente and thinner. The beef is easy to eat next time I will have it with the tendons. It was filling enough but you know I had to order the tofu too. I have had their stinky tofu before which I get cravings for once in a while, not the stinkiest out there but very flavorful, regardless when you bite in then it hits you (in a good way, if you're into that)."}
{"text":"[Location] 4/5 - Located on the south side of the FMP (First Markham Place). At lunch time, the parking lot in the south side gets filled quickly. So do come early if you want a good parking spot. Additionally, the place is packed with many regulars; thus, best to come early before the storm.

[Service] 5/5 - the staff hasn't changed for many years. They are very quick and attentive for your every needs. 

[Atmosphere] 4/5 - They got this \"Black and White\" look with the dark wood tables and chairs with the constrasting light white walls. 

[Food] 5/5 - Since I have visited this place for many many years, I have sampled everything on the menu including all the various dishes and side appetizier dishes. The stinky tofu dish is a must but be prepared to get your clothing \"stinky\". I got a few colleagues who decided not their best garments into the restaurant. The traditional beef noodle soup is one of my favourite dishes here with the homemade noodles and really soft beef pieces. The broth is very flavourful and aromatic. 

[Overall] 5/5 - As long as the food is good, it wins over everything else for me (including bad service)."}
{"text":"Be prepared to be hit with the stinky tofu smell even from out the door!  You do get used to the smell by the time you're sat down though.

I think the stinky tofu used to be a bigger dish but is now a smaller dish.  (it's still a good size)  Other than that, the noodles here are good but there are few veggie options (always like to have a veggie dish when I eat) and the portions are quite small.  

I find that a L size noodle and a regular size doesn't differ that much, would definitely recommend just a regular size.  Service is usually lacking because I only ever see one woman serve the entire place."}
{"text":"YUP. YUM. DAMN. NOOOOODLES! FTW.

OK, I have a question for you, what happens when a bowl of Pho has carnal relations with a bowl of Ramen on top of a bed of beef? I'll tell you what SON, Mei Nung Beef Noodle House is born. Ho-lee Chow!

MNBNH is tucked away in the back of FMP - First Markham Place - for you white people reading... pfft (for the record I used to be white, but during my tenure at Yelp my community has, because of my love for the foods and culture of Asia, dubbed me HA = Honorary Asian. So I CAN say, white people. Got it? Good! It's not a big place or a fancy place but the food more than fills your senses from your first taste to your last slurp.

Allow me to explain, in graphic design, they talk about the use of negative space to help put a spotlight on the focal point of the piece. At Mei Nung while the space aint fancy it's actually a perfect background to allow the food to shine - and it does.

Today was my first glorious visit and for the quality, the taste and the price, it's a no-brainer that I will be back soon. I went with the classic beef noodle soup which comes with a thicker almost soba style noodle (maybe it IS a soba noodle) in a wonderful brown beef broth with hefty portions of succulent, tender hunks of beef mixed throughout. Add to this already sexy Menage Trois of ingredients, some pickled veggies (almost like a relish) and some perfectly cooked Bok Choi join in the orgy that is about to go down in your mouth.

They have a variety of options including, beef, beef tendon, beef and beef tendon, and other variations which I plan to try - I mean... WINTER IS COMING? Amiright? (praise be to John Snow). You can get these dishes in either large or small, I went with a large and it was perfect. Total cost tax in was under $10 - plus all you can drink hot tea?

Taste, value for money, wow factor, mouth orgy - Yep. Mei Nung Noodles. What dreams are made of (wet dreams that is).

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"had the beef & beef tendon noodle soup, dried beef noodle, and stinky tofu here... they only accepted cash..and don't forget to check in to yelp because they offer 10% off if you check in

Let's talk about its food

Beef & beef tendon noodle soup- the beef and the tendon are really soft and flavorful..the noodles are good but not the type of noodle that i see from an authentic Taiwanese noodle place..the soup base is good..

Dried beef noodle- same type of noodle..just wish it could have more flavorful sauce for the dried noodle. it is just alright

stinky tofu..somewhat disappointed..it is stinky on the outside but when i took a bite on it..the tofu itself is really tasteless...and taste kinda artificial...didn't really taste like a real tofu...definitely far away from an authentic stinky tofu that i had in Taiwan...the cabbage pickles are good thou..


This is our second time here..first time was great..but the second is kinda disappointing."}
{"text":"By far one of the best noodle places I've gone too.

I haven't been to first Markham place for a while and as I was walking the strips of restaurant, I mention to my sister if she smelled something in the air. Turns out it was the smell of stinky tofu. I couldn't figure where exactly it was coming from. However, once we located the restaurant, my sister asked if I wanted it to go.  I was full from our steak meal and told her another day. 


Three weeks later, my friend told me there was a really good restaurant. I mention to her I could eat anything. Turns out, she picked the same restaurant I wanted to try out. 

Once we got in, I let my friend do all the ordering with only one stipulation; one order of stinky tofu.

She had ordered me and her a bowl of homemade beef tendon. The meat was cooked perfectly, leaving you drooling after each bite.

The stinky tofu was such a large portion and came with pickled cabbage. 

Best mix is to dip the pickled cabbage in the hot sauce and stuff it in the stinky tofu, so you get a bite of cabbage with tofu.

Honestly, just writing about it makes me crave for it. No exaggeration here. Highly recommend this place if your looking for a good bowl of noodles and don't mind the smell of stinky fermented tofu. 

This is so popular that when my coworker asked what I did on the weekend, I told him I went to a killer noodle place. Little did we realized we both went to the same place but on different days on the weekend! 

Give this place a shot, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I had the stinky tofu, beef noodle soup and a few small dishes. The service was prompt and friendly; portions were adequate. I wasn't too impressed with the beef noodle soup, however. The meat was pretty tender and I liked the noodle, but the soup wasn't particularly flavorful. I've had much better."}
{"text":"Are you craving beef noodles?? This is the place to go! *NOTE: if you don't like the smell of stinky tofu, be warned, it is the first thing you will smell upon entering the restaurant*

There might be a bit of a wait if you go during dinner time, but it is well worth it. There are only 10 tables in the restaurant, hence the wait. 

The beef noodles are amazing!  There are beef noodles, beef tendon noodles, or if you're craving both, beef and tendon noodles. They come in small and large, but a small is plenty as they give a lot of noodles and quite a bit of beef. The beef is not fatty at all which I really like. The tendon is also cooked to a tender and soft state. The soup is flavourful but not too heavy, which is hard to find. The noodles are also the thick and chewy ones. They're also house made which is a bonus!! There are also other dishes like seaweed strands, and of course, stinky tofu! It comes in a good portion and is fried upon ordering. It's definitely better than lining up at a night market for a little box of a few tofu. 

The service is quick and the tea is quite good as well. Even though there is a bit of a wait at times, this is my go to beef noodle place!"}
{"text":"Good portion even for a small bowl of beef noodle soup. Lots of beef! I do wish there was more veggies but you can always order a side dish of veggies. Quick service and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"You can smell their stinky tofu from 500m away... god so stinky...but so...deliciousss...

who doesn't like fried tofu? I mean its so crispy and juicy.. !!

The signature beef noodles was pretty good too..the beef was moist and the soup was not too salty not too plain !!"}
{"text":"This is another decent spot in First Markham Place. It's not very spacious and it doesn't smell great inside, but the food makes up for this.

I had the beef noodle with sesame sauce. The beef was well prepared except for the fact that it had a lot of fat on it. This may be the style of the cuisine, but it's not something I find appealing. The noodles in sesame sauce were amazing though! I really enjoyed them.

The portions here are huge! Also, the service was quite food."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place for some Taiwanese Beef Noodles and it's not disappointing. We went on Saturday night and it got really busy right after we came in. The beef was really tender and the noodles tastes amazing! We also ordered appetizers like pig ears and seaweed. The service was a bit slow and we had to asked the owner to refill our water and at times felt neglected."}
{"text":"The beef tendon noodle soup has declined unfortunately. I use to get it all the time because every single piece is tender and delicious. Last time I was there was two weeks ago and only one of the pieces of four were tender. Two other ones were not really chewable."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT TASTING PULLED NOODLES AND BROTH. Only complaint is the stinky tofu smell. If you are not a fan, it takes a few minutes to get used to. 

A good Tawainese, authentic noodle experience. Family run restaurant. They should hire more help though, service can be kind of slow."}
{"text":"You can really smell the stinky tofu as u want in, the smell does go away after a few minutes. The beef noodle soup is a must try, the broth is a strong beef taste but not in an artificial way. The side dishes are amazing my favourite would have to be the cucumber one!! Really friendly staff, nice clean restaurant smaller but does the trick!!"}
{"text":"There's no taste like home and holy whack-a-moley did we find that here! This place turned up on my search results as a sponsored ad and it's the best ad I've ever clicked on. After a non-stop day since arriving in Toronto at 9 AM, we finally got to Mei Nung at 7 PM after wine tasting near Niagara Falls. WE WERE RAVISHED. FEED US!!!

Upon entering Mei Nung, we smelled the smelly smell that smells like stinky tofu. It stinks so good. There was a 15-minute wait right by the door as the restaurant was justifiably packed at dinner time but service was prompt as soon as we were seated. The 3 of us got:
- the 3 appetizer sampler: very lackluster; bamboo shoots and seaweed were not very flavorful, and pig ears were just okay. 
- stinky tofu!!!!!! best I've had outside of my favorite spot in Taipei. The cripsy tofu, sauce, and spicy pickled cabbage were SO on point. I probably could've just gotten this on my own and be content.
- beef noodle soup- hits the spot for any cold, windy night. There was plenty of meat and veggies to make this a hearty meal.
- dry beef noodles- never had this anywhere else but also delicious. The sauce has a hint of sweetness that makes you forget to be ashamed of your carb binge.
Suffice to say, we were all waddling around with our food babies afterwards with no regret.

This place ties with Hoja Luwei as my favorite meals in Toronto. Parking was hard to find and made ever more challenging with fellow AZNs but come here ASAP and fulfill your Taiwanese cravings! The sign is not very well lit so good luck and furrow those brows until you find it!"}
{"text":"I had been by here so many times in the past couple years, but never actually went in. Finally went in, and man was the food ever good!

Ordered myself the Beef and Tendon Noodles in Soup and the Stinky Tofu. Noodles were really good, nice and tender with the soup base with a good amount of flavour. The beef and tendons were both really good. Hard to find a store that gives you quality in both those, as usually a store is lacking in one or the other. The Stinky Tofu was absolutely great. Now, you either like it or you don't, and I'm definitely a fan! Nice and crispy on the outside and warm on the inside, with a good amount of sauce and veggies on the side!

I don't mind the smell of stinky tofu, so it doesn't bother me much, but if you don't really like that smell, you may find yourself having a hard time getting yourself here. Service is great, as they were super busy for lunch, but still able to meet everyone's needs. They also give 10% off if you check in with the Yelp app, which is more of a reason to come here!"}
{"text":"Best beef noodle soup and taiwanese stinky tofu in Toronto!! Way better than Papa Chang. Went there many many times. Their hot sauce (the brownish one is the best to pair with the noodle soup). I love this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious beef noodle soup with a good amount of homemade noodles. This is authentic stuff just like you would get in Taiwan. They even serve stinky tofu so be warned that the restaurant does smell like it inside. Service is fast and friendly and prices are very reasonable. The noodle soup sure does hit the spot on a cold winters day.  This is located in the First Markham Place plaza so parking can sometimes be an issue.  The actual restaurant is pretty small with maybe 10 tables but the wait isn't usually very long."}
{"text":"this place is great!! Noodles taste really good!!! The only problem i had is that the stinky tofu other ppl ordered stinks too bad. Kind of affects my appetite but overall it's great"}
{"text":"Super yummy!  We came here upon recommendation by friends who raved about the beef noodle soup where the thick noodle is hand made.  The beef was so soft. the soup incredibly flavourful, the noodles cooked perfectly al dente and the bright green veggies were a welcome complement to the lunch.  At $5.99 plus tax for the small bowl, I was pleasantly satisfied.  Everything came very quickly after ordering and it looked like the chef took care with the quality of ingredients and presentation.  My companions also had the version of beef noodle without soup and that was tasty as well.  I was almost expecting a bit of a rundown experience from just looking at the exterior of the restaurant which as it turned out was completely not the case.  I've always passed by and dismissed this restaurant - not anymore!  

We had the stinky tofu (my first time!) and I think I'm getting into it.  It wasn't as pungent as the other times I had smelled it like at the annual night market at Warden and Steeles.  The fried tofu was dense and had good texture.  The experience wasn't as intense as I thought it would be - just yummy and it has peaked my interest enough that I want to keep trying it!

We were seated pretty much right away even though it was the late lunch time on Sunday.  Parking is a hassle at First Markham, but better than other Asian plazas.  There's a lot of parking spots, and more than enough visitors to justify every single one of them."}
{"text":"If you can put up with the smell, then it's worth trying out noodles at Mei's.   After about 5-10 minutes your nose quickly adjusts and the smell of stinky tofu dissipates.   

We tried out the beef tendon soup noodles.   A+!   I would say that their noodles is even better than Ding Tai Fung in the same plaza.   I got a small but the size was misleading!  The bowl was jam packed with noodles, good portion of beef tendons and bok choy. 

Of course, we had to try out the famous stinky tofu and their century year old egg and tofu plus a side order of veggies.   The stinky tofu tasted good, crunchy and luckily didn't taste the way it smells.   There was copious amounts of century year old egg on the tofu with a topping of bonito flakes.   

The only downside with the restaurant is the sound.   It can be extremely loud as the restaurant is fairly small and doesn't dampen the sound well.   Luckily once the louder group finished and left, we could hear each  other talk across the table.   

Give this smelly restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"Solid beef noodle soup! 

Because I am so deprived of Taiwanese beef noodle soup in Cleveland, I will give Mei Nung 5 stars. 

Mmmmm... 

We decided that there were 2-3 different kinds of beef noodle soup out there, and this was not the kind with a lighter broth. This broth was packed with flavor and just the right amount of meat. The noodles had a great consistency and it filled me up!

We got the thousand year old egg + tofu side dish with bonito flakes... such tastiness.  

My bf says this beef noodle soup is better than the ones in california (bay area) and is second to the beef noodle soup in Taiwan!"}
{"text":"Always been my favourite noodle place uptown.. Both the one with soup and the one without soup are great. Customer service can be improved but I'm not going to be picky on the customer service when it's not a big store."}
{"text":"First time coming here based on recommendation.

Upon opening the door, I'm hit with this strong familiar aroma. And then I see every other table has a plate of fried tofu, and everything makes sense. It took a few minutes to acclimate to this environment, but after awhile you get used to it. Or you might not, I don't know.

In contrast to the overall decor, the menu is pretty nice in design: lots of pictures that showcase what you're getting.

I ordered a large beef noodle soup.

Bowls are served within 10 minutes. It comes with a dozen pieces of meat, which is pretty generous. They are also very tender to chew on, which is a must have. The broth itself is also quite clean, with very little grease in sight, with a nice subtle beef flavor. The noodles are thick and chewy, though I find that they are lacking in flavor.

It's a pretty good bowl of beef noodle soup. I would be interested to see how other places are.

When the bill came, I noticed that they charged a dollar less than the menu price (8.49 instead of 9.49 for the large). Not sure if this was a mistake, or they just never updated the cash machine."}
{"text":"Delicious joint, with standard options.  Definitely go for the original beef in noodle soup.  The other options like sesame sauce with beef and noodle might work better in smaller portions since the sesame did dry up the mouth compared to the soup having a broth with noodle.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"As per everyone else's review, it's pretty pungent in here. But I consider myself of a beef noodle soup connoisseur and theirs is solid. I got the meat and tendon one and it was delicious. The noodles were great and both the meat and tendon were soft and tasty. Definitely sated my craving. 

I may have found a new haunt for lunch."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Taiwanese style beef noodle in Toronto!  In each bowl is a super delicious package of fresh home-made noodles, flavourful broth, and plentiful tender beef and/or tendon pieces.  The restaurant gets busy some times, but the quality of food hasn't suffered.  

Consider yourself warned that the place smells stinky tofu most of the time.  If that's not your whiff of choice or tolerance, please don't hold out on the nice beef noodles but do one of the following: (1) practice to hold your breath long enough to slurp down the entire bowl of noodles; (2) if you have Japanese friends who have face masks, borrow one; (3) if #2 fails, hold your breath just long enough to get a take-out.  I've had the stinky tofu here, it's okay, not the best or the stinkiest I've had."}
{"text":"Have always been a fan of their beef noodles however if you cannot stand stinky tofu do not come here. It does really reek. I myself don't like stinky tofu and hate the smell but will tank it for noodles. The broth is delicious and i generally get the tendon as a topping."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite beef noodle places in town! Their noodles are amazing, the broth was super tasty, and the beef was very soft. For some people, the downside of this restaurant might be the heavy stinky tofu smell that hits you as soon as you open the door. If you can get over that though, you will love this place. The servers are friendly, the place looks clean, and they have one of the best beef noodle soups I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"We walked into this restaurant due to the pungent smell - it is not a bad thing if you like it as much as we do. We pass on the beef noodle soup that day as it did not seem appetizing when other customers were eating it. Instead, we ordered one plate of stinky tofu. The cost was about $6.99 for 6-8 pcs of tofu. 

First off, the entire restaurant reeks as soon as you walk through the doors. You would expect that when you bite into stinky tofu, the scent will linger in your breath which adds a different tingle in your taste buds. But unfortunately, it did nothing for me. I am not a super-taster but I am a bit of a stinky tofu connoisseur. The hot sauce was not spicy enough nor was the hoisin sauce thick enough to stick onto the tofu. The cabbage was nothing spectacular. 

I would highly recommend stinky tofu at this location if you do not like the strong/pungent taste of it."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, their beef noodle is amazing! But it's the hard-to-find \"smelly tofu\" is what I come here for. Truth be told, its still not stinky enough. 

It's been awhile since I my last visit more than a year ago. I noticed that they removed the small size order for the smelly tofu from their menu, which doesn't make difference- since I always get the large."}
{"text":"Great food quality and service. Though because of the stinky tofu, the smell inside is not good. But anyway we love it!"}
{"text":"The food was good, my daughter and I each had a small bowl of noodle and we ordered the stinky tofu.  The noodle was a little under-cooked but the broth was excellent.  The place is rich with the aroma of the stinky tofu, I saw a girl came in with her parents without her coat at -15(guess she had a date later).  All said, it's a great place for lunch or a light snack between meals."}
{"text":"Stinkiest stinky tofu in Toronto!!  Since I don't eat beef, I couldn't really try out their famous beef noodel.  But my friends who had it, all said it was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing beef noodles. Horrible smell. This sums up the restaurant quite well. Stinky tofu is a very ethnic dish. One that I'm not accustomed to. The whole time I was there I felt pretty uncomfortable. But I would say it was worth it. That's how good I think the noodles are.

This kind of \"braised beef\" soup noodle can be found everywhere but I find this one to be the clear winner. If I have to pick one point, it would be the noodle texture. Something about it feels more \"bouncy\", implying it's more fresh. The soup is just rich enough, not overly salty to my taste. 

If I have to nitpick, I would say the beef was not tender enough. I've had much more succulent pieces of beef with this kind of noodle. But I'm not that picky with meat. The noodles and soup make it worth it. 

Fun adventure: Bring a \"foreigner\" here."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone who's craving noodles and is in the vicinity.

You can smell the stinky tofu before you even walk in to the restaurant. I've tried the stinky tofu and as smelly as it is, it is not amazinggggg. It lacks flavour and it's kind of dry

I usually get the house beef - tender beef with flavourful broth and thick noodles that's always cooked to perfection.
Portion (small) doesn't really fill me but it is ok. Opt for the Large if you have a big appetite"}
{"text":"I love their handmade noodles here, and the service was fast and efficient. We got our food very quickly and it was flavourful (maybe a tad bit too salty). The only thing is, the restaurant smells very strongly of stinky tofu, so if you're not a fan of the smell you might not be able to endure it."}
{"text":"My brother brought me to this place and warned me the smell inside from the stinky tofu would be stinky. So I prepared myself and it was quite stinky for the first few mins and then my nose got used to it. 

We had the beef noodle soup and it was so delicious. I would go back again!"}
{"text":"The smell of the stinky tofu is undeniable when you take the first few steps into the restaurant. For someone that is just here for the noodles, this took me a bit of while getting used to...My advice is to pick an area where there are less customers and pray that no one else around you orders stinky tofu!

We were seated at the back of the restaurant at a 6 person-table bc all of the other smaller tables were full. This was close to 9pm. 

Food: their noodles are legendary! We ordered a large beef noodle with soup and a small beef noodle with fried sauce only (???). The latter is similar to the Korean noddles with black bean sauce (jajangmyun) except the noodles tasted more handmade, more chewy, and more edged (prob from the handcut). Besides beef, it came with bean sprouts, meat bits, and cucumber. Both of the noodles were amazing and very authentic to the cooking style from the motherland. I would highly recommend either of the two! 

Portions are very filling. If you are super hungry, go with the large. Hungry, go for the small. They don't offer kids portion so if you're not hungry, share it and take the rest to go. 

Also, they are currently taking 10% off your bill if you check in! Ours for the two noodle orders came to around $16 after tax. We tipped them extra bc our noodles came super quick and mine was even carried by the chef from the kitchen!"}
{"text":"The best Taiwanese beef in Richmond Hill. The home-made noodle is a must-try!.  There's also stinky tofu here.  Not quite as good as the ones they sell at the night market, but still not bad.  Also worth trying are their small appetizer dishes."}
{"text":"Not very good, nor very authentic at all. I wouldn't go back again and I got a bellyache after it. What does a Taiwanese girl have to do to find good Taiwanese food in the city?!??"}
{"text":"This is the fiance and my go to place for taiwanese beef noodles, even better since it's so close to home. We would each get our own beef and beef tendon soup noodle bowl and a large stinky tofu dish (to share, of course). The noodles here are made al dente, the broth is flavorful, the beef and beef tendons are soft and tender, and the portions are pretty generous. As for the stinky tofu, you can smell it miles away. Its crispy and delicious especially with the pickled veggies. It may not be the best stinky tofu out there but not many places make them anymore. It definitely helps cure the cravings. So don't forget to check this place out except on Tuesdays (since they're closed) and check into yelp for your 10% discount!!"}
{"text":"My SO and I try to come here at least once a month - we pretty much tell our friends and family about this place. 

LOVE the beef brisket noodle soup here. The noodles are very \"bouncy\" and the broth is very tasty and flavourful. The beef brisket is also really yummy. There's limited fat. And the brisket kind of \"melts in your mouth\". By the time I'm done, there's hardly ever any soup left. I always eat until what feels like I'm 120% full here because it's just so delicious. Must try. 

We also tend to order stinky tofu from here. I'm generally not a huge fan of stinky tofu, but I tried it here and liked it. It comes with this cold and sweet choy that you eat with the stinky tofu. When it comes out of the kitchen and is still warm, it's a very yummy combination.

In terms of ambience, I'm not sure why people say it has poor ventilation. I've been here several times in the summer and it's very well AC'd. I usually wear a sweater. People need to get over the stinky tofu smell because that's just what it smells like. My only knock on this place is that it doesn't accept credit card. My SO and I usually don't carry cash. :("}
{"text":"Update: Is there even a point to check-in every time I come here cause I'm back again. My review just isn't right without a photo to back-up how delicious the beef noodles were. So I got the photo and I've got one word for the food. B-O-M-B :)"}
{"text":"Food worth hold your nose for. By far the best stinky tofu I've had thus far. The star attraction and main feature of the restaurant, you will definitely smell the glorious perfume before even setting foot in the front door. As unappealing as the name stinky tofu suggest, the delicate texture, crispy exterior, and strong smell is a delicacy that should not be overlooked. This place does it best. The tofu does not taste as strong as its namesake. The initial sensory overload is met with a silky creamy texture once you bite into it. The taste is neither off-putting nor strong; it carried the sweet soy based sauce quite well, accompanied by their sweet and vinegary pickled cabbage and extreme mouth scorching hot sauce.   

I definitively love this place for not only doing the tofu well, but also for the noodles and cold dishes. The handmade noodles have a very nice resistance and chewiness to them. The portion are made to be shared and the meat are braised to a good level of tenderness. The cold dishes were all so flavourful. It provides a good variety of food you can combine with noodles or feeling fancy and combine it with the order of tofu.

Although service is not always friendly, but at a certain point, I'm going to count my blessing for their food and move on. I really enjoy their offerings. The food will keep me coming back for those insatiable craving days."}
{"text":"Just love my stinky tofu.  The service is very good. Beef noodle soup taste very good.  No disappointment here.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"Overwhelmed by the smell of their famous stinky tofu the moment I walked in. I'm not a fan of this Taiwanese delicacies, but if you are or feeling adventurous this place should please you well.

I'm here for the Taiwanese beef noodle! Noodle have a nice chewy texture, which is what you should expect for this dish. It should never be too soft. Beef on the other hand was tender and the broth mixed with a spoonful of salty-sour-vegetable bits was on point! This dish comes in two serving sizes and the large was very filling.

Sadly they don't serve soup dumpling (xiaolongbao) here. However regular dumplings are available; worth a try."}
{"text":"Best Taiwanese beef noodle soup and stinky tofu in GTA. Also comes in Taiwanese beef noodle with sesame paste."}
{"text":"The noodles were house made and tender and enjoyable to eat and chew. The beef in the soup was delicious. Would come here again for sure! 

The tofu and dried squid app was pretty good as well I would have liked extra dry squid!"}
{"text":"My favourite Taiwanese style beef noodles fix in town!

I always order beef and beef tendon noodles when I visit this place. The meat was tender and soft. Noodles were thick and chewy, and was cooked al dente. The broth was strong with anise taste but not overpowering. Chopped fermented veggies added on top made the soup even more flavorful. Portion was pretty big - I felt really full to finish the whole bowl for lunch even when I ordered small size. There are few nice side dishes to order as well. I opted for beef tripe. 

Many people ordered stinky tofu as their side dishes. This is a bit different from the Hong Kong version where the stinky tofu are deep fried in big rectangular chunks and eat with sweet sauce and chili sauce. This one was served in smaller triangles with hoisin sauce on top and topped with sour pickled vegetables. I loved the Hong Kong version more, and somehow I'm just ok with the Taiwanese version. If you are new (or hate) to stinky tofu you might find the strong smell very unpleasant, as the store's ventilation system is pretty weak. You would definitely smell like stinky tofu after dining."}
{"text":"Finally gotten the chance to come here to try this place out. The restaurant itself is very simple with the decor. But hey, I ain't paying money to eat the \"decorations\". Rather I am here to try their noodles and other tasty food.

After I browsed through the menu, I decided to get the tofu with century old egg with shaving of dried squid. This did not disappoint at all. Rather it's very refreshing with the cold tofu. They put a savoury sauce that offsets the blandness of the tofu. Not bad. The main courses I ordered a beef and beef tendon noodles in a fry bean sauce. This was so yummy! I like how the tendons melt in my mouth and the beef was braised for so long that it was soft and not chewy at all. Onto the final dish we chose: dumplings and beef tendon. The dumplings were yummy yet not too meaty. Again, the tendons melt in my mouth. So overall food was excellent. 

Service wise, the staff are attentive and not intrusive. Will I come back? Yes I will."}
{"text":"Stinky tofu probably best available in Toronto. That said, they were bit too dry for my liking. Sauce wasn't as spicy as hoped."}
{"text":"I come here often. It always tastes the same, and it's always good. 

Fairly quick service. However, the stinky tofu takes about 15mins to be fried to perfection. The veggies are very pickled and sour. It all tastes lovely with the red hot sauce, if you can ignore the smell haha. 

On the other hand, I always get the beef stomach with noodles, because I don't like the beef itself (not just here, anywhere). My family does enjoy it a lot though. The noodles and soup are very good - very authentic. It also comes with a little bit of choy.  

I think their hot sauces are very notable for their kick and flavour. Taste a bit before you slather on your regular amount! The one for the noodle is brown, the one for the tofu is red. I haven't had the brown hot sauce anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I don't think words can express just how much I love this place. Their beef noodle soup and stinky tofu are absolutely amazing. My favourite menu item (aside from stinky tofu) is the tripe beef noodle soup. The tripe is huge and they give generous portions. The soup itself is very flavourful, the bok choy is fresh, the preserved vegetables are delicious and the noodles are a perfect degree of chewy. 

The star of the menu is, without a doubt, the deep fried stinky tofu. My mouth is watering just typing this sentence. The odour of the tofu (which, for those who don't know, is fermented in brine) can gross out passerbys who don't know what Mei Nung serves. I used to be one of those people until last year when I was converted with my first taste of a hot, sauce-covered triangle of stinky tofu. It does not taste like the smell, though your after-meal burps will let everyone know where you went for dinner - this isn't the place to go for a first date. 

The service is friendly and attentive for Chinese and non-Chinese speakers alike. Water and tea is quickly refilled, even when the restaurant is packed with diners. The take-out servings are just as generous as the eat-in servings. 

The restrooms are clean, especially by Asian restaurant standards.

It makes me very sad that they aren't open on Tuesdays because there have been so many times that I've had a spontaneous craving for stinky tofu on a Tuesday. I guess my stomach just wants what it can't have! Thankfully, they are open until 10:00 PM on the other days!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good, but when I went there recently, their service was terrible. The male server purposely ignored us!!! Never going back!!!"}
{"text":"After coming here now more than 20 times, it was time to increase the rating. 

Mei Nung is probably my favourite beef noodle soup place in the city. The broth has a nice slightly salty and sweet flavour, the beef is always consistently chewy and the noodles are hand made and nicely al dente. 

Yes, the place smells like stinky tofu, but after having beef noodle soup in different cities, I still come back here for a consistent and familiar bowl of delicious noodles."}
{"text":"My hubby and I just came back from a trip from Taipei and really craved the nice beef noodle soup with a good broth and really really soft brisket! We also had tons of Stinky tofu in the different night markets and just miss the flavors!

He usually doesn't yelp much, but since he was craving it so much, he wanted to find a place close to home for that same amazing flavor. 

Happy we stumbled to this place. It was quite busy on a Sunday afternoon ( lunch time) and I obviously was shocked that as soon as entering the first set of doors, that very recognizable pungent odor of Stinky tofu filled the air. We opened the second set of doors to the restaurant and just experienced the full blown effect. 

Seriously.... If you didn't know what this smell was, you would probably want to leave this place ( maybe fear of not keeping the place clean, smell of toilet or garbage odor, etc). 

But if you're a fan of stinky tofu... Here's to strong odors!!! We decided to stay in the restaurant to get \"assimilated\" to the scent... And by the time our tablr was called, we hardly noticed the smell! 

Minus half star for stinkiness! 

The actually order of stinky tofu priced at $7.50 was very good for two ppl!!! We had more than enough... Very good sauce as cabbage to go along with it!! Stinky if you breathe it in hard. Highly recommend

We also ordered large beef noodle soup and small half tendon and half beef noodle soup ( homemade noodles) 
Again, even the small order has tons of noodles left. By the time I'm done and couldn't stuff anymore....I had so much noodles left in that small bowl. 

Tendons were delicious. Next time I'll order tendon only. Highly recommend. 

I didn't enjoy my beef... Not soft enough ( his order of beef noodle soup has softer beef) but not as soft as the ones I've had before. 
Minus half star. 

Will go back. Next time I'll share tendon soup noodles and order stinky tofu again!!"}
{"text":"Mei Nung is still #1 in my books for TW-style Beef Noodle.  Many Many Many... A long time ago when this place opened, I was so EXCITED and at that time it did not disappoint as there are really limited restaurants that offer TW Beef Noodle so a resto focused on TW Beef Noodle was like I've gone to heaven.

What made me even more excited was that they did HAND-MADE noodles and it is part of their BUSINESS NAME(Chinese) and it tasted GREAT.  

Reminded me of my trip to Taiwan even though at that time I didn't have Beef Noodle in Taiwan yet, but they do close 1 day on a weekday just like Taiwan shops and restaurants.

The soup broth was GOOD too, but maybe I have higher expectations since I've made my own Beef Noodle awhile back.  The Beef could be better, and I have had better beef elsewhere but the Hand-Made Noodles rocked my world.

Even though I enjoyed the Noodles, the few times I've been there it really depends on the day as it can be inconsistent from one day to another which is why the FIRST time was most memorable for me.

They also have STINKY TOFU served with Pickled Cabbage(Kimchi).  Seriously I don't even smell the stink anymore, even from the ones in Taiwan but the Tofu here should be considered as it is Crispy outside and Moist inside."}
{"text":"It's a really good noodle house and great value, but the smell because of the stinky tofu is pretty intense. So the smell alone may put most people off."}
{"text":"My new fav. restaurant in FMP!

Pros:
-hand made noodles, cooked al dente; perfect size and texture
-generous portions of beef; the tendon is heavenly
-huge portion; will fill you up even if you're starving

Cons:
-smells like stinky tofu

This place is 1000x better than the beef noodle soup house at new kennedy square/peach tree plaza. Try it out and thank me later. You're welcome."}

{"text":"I actually smells bamboo shoots when I walked through the door instead of the stinky tofu scent that everyone was talking about in their yelp review. However, you DO get used to the smell, especially when the food comes in.

We got the homemade beef noodle soup (large), you can select between small and large, as well as the homemade dumplings. The homemade dumplings take a little longer and we were warned and given a time frame from one of the servers here before we ordered. The homemade beef noodle soup came with warm soup and tender beef pieces in a large bowl noodles. The noodles were standard in my opinion, but as a whole, it was a decent price for the value of their food. This bowl is their signature bowl in my opinion - everyone seems to order it!

The dumplings were actually my favourite part of this meal. There were 12 large dumplings that had delicious hot soup inside each and every single one of the them. The skin of the dumpling IS a little thicker, and usually I'm not a fan of thicker skinned dumplings, but this one definitely was an exception. I liked the dumplings so much that next time I come back, I think I'm going to order the dumplings plus another dish.

For 2 people, we had just enough of food. It was perfect for a cold day.

{"text":"The smell is the first thing you noticed. But after a while you get used to it.
The beef noodle soup is awesome. And instead of waiting in line at say night it up for stinky tofu, get it here! No line ups and it comes hot and crispy"}
{"text":"So good, and every time we come to visit, it is always consistent in flavor and quantity. We always get the Beef Noodle soup (Husband large size, Me small size) and it's always perfectly balanced in noodles and broth and the cuts of meat are tender and not fatty. :)

I just love being able to write an update of a place that I've been coming to for a while and the food is STILL fantastic. I only wish now that there was a place like this around where I live, but I'm more than willing to make the 2.5 hour trek to have my Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup fix from here!"}
{"text":"I love noodles, especially noodles done right! Mei Nung is still one of my favourites at FMP. I came with my bf shortly after 1PM this past Saturday and can say their beef noodle soup is still one of my favourites.

Their menu is short and sweet, and an average meal will cost you around $12 with tax and tip. I got the beef tendon w/ slices while the BF ordered the beef only noodle soup. We also got a stinky tofu to share as this stuff is a treat (we know - the smell is unpleasant, but the taste is pretty darn good!) If you aren't getting any appetizers, I'd advise on a large, as a small soup noodle only has about 1 cup portion of noodles. 

Love their soup!! It's flavourful, without being too oily or heavy on the MSG. Their noodles are also cooked al dente, so it's got just the right amount of bite when you chew after slurping (or not). I love that you have the option of soup noodles, or dumplings to change things up. They've got an assortment of combined beef, tendon, tripe, strips (flank?) as well as both the black bean sauce, and sesame sauce noodles. Looking forward to trying these next time!

Both bowls came relatively quickly (sub 10 mins) and the tofu arrived shortly after. The waitresses are prompt, attentive, and friendly. I watched one of them move some seats around to accommodate a booster seat for a toddler. They also refilled tea quickly and were prompt to give me more serviettes when I asked them. 


Cash only."}
{"text":"Great beef noodle soup.  House-made noodles.  Broth is rich and beefy.  Stinky Tofu is nicely fried and in good size chunks.  My wife and I are pretty full after sharing a large Beef and Tendon Noodle Soup with a side of Stinky Tofu.  Good value and consistently tasty.  Will always return."}
{"text":"Delicious Taiwanese Noodles , the beef and beef tendon are very tender and the large bowl is so filling. Good price ."}
{"text":"Yummmm!  5 stars for the beef tendon! I got the beef tendon and meat noodle soup, but I should have just gotten beef tendon.  I would have ordered a bowl of just tendon if that were on the menu.

Stinky tofu was okay.  Also tried the cold tofu with preserved egg.  Wouldn't order either again, but was glad I tried them.

Cash only. Check in and get 10% off!"}
{"text":"Beef noodle soup : 5/5
Stinky tofu : 4/5
Service : average
Environment : good
 
Their beef noodle soup is the best one I have had out of Taiwan. The broth isn't like the ones made with just soy sauce in other restaurant, I think they've put lot of ingredient and time in it. 
Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda disappointed at this place. I had pretty high expectations from the four star overall rating on yelp and wasn't impressed by anything. I really wanted to like this place but it falls short of what I'm used to. Everything we ordered was simply ok, and nothing was special including the beef noodle soup :(

We started with the 3 side dishes which I am a huge fan of, the beef tripe, pig ear, and the seaweed. I don't recommend them, they were all pretty bland and had nothing to them. I was dousing them in chili sauce. By far the pig ear was the best one of the three.

Next up was the fried stinky tofu, it was crispy and had a nice sweet sauce with it. It was okay, again I don't exactly like stinky tofu but it was decent. 

The dumplings were just okay. I am not used to thick doughy dumplings wrappers and the meat inside was rather tough. I do not recommend these.

The beef noodle soup was definitely the best thing we ordered though, the noodles were chewy in a good way and the broth was pretty good and flavourful. There's a distinct sourness though and I found the beef to be a tad tough/chewy which is disappointing. I've had better at other restaurants.

Lastly, the zhajiangmein/fried bean sauce noodles didn't have much going on. It was skimpy on the bean sauce/pork and tasted rather bland. 

Service was standard and I felt the value could have been a bit better.

All in all, just stick with the beef noodles here. Everyone  orders one!"}
{"text":"Really good Taiwainese style beef noodle soup, their stinky tofu is good too. Most the noodle item and the side dishes are all very good, I love their brown boiled egg. Very busy restaurant but service and line up is quick, everyone just eat and go. Price wise is also very good. I find their Taiwanese style beef noodle is the best around GTA."}
{"text":"Loved the stinky tofu and cold tofu. Worth a try. Decent price. But when you enter the place, the entire restaurant smells like stinky tofu a bit."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the beef noodle soup and stinky tofu. Both are pretty authentic compared to a lot of other places in town. The price for the portions are extremely good as well, so it will for sure fill you up. We had 2 bowls of noodle and a plate of stinky tofu which costed us just below 30$ before tips."}
{"text":"I made the rookie mistake of using up my cash to buy bubble tea at The Alley and leaving none for FMP. Luckily, I managed to find some change in my car, used the Yelp 10% discount, and managed to order a large beef and beef tendon noodles. The total came to $9.65.
This place has been around since I was in university (which is more than 5 years ago) and the taste has been consistent over the years. The broth is flavorful, the beef is tender, and the noodles are chewy. I like the diced preserved vegetables as garnish because it adds a bit of saltiness and crunchiness. I asked for chili oil on the side because nothing beats a cold winter night like a steaming bowl of spicy noodles. I do suspect that they use MSG in their soup because I felt very parched after dinner.
The noodles are pretty bland if you just throw it into the soup and eat it. My advice is to let it sit in the soup till it has a brownish tint to it before you start slurping.
If you do bring enough cash to the establishment, their beef tripe is a great complement to the noodles."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying stinky tofu! I was hesitant due to its strong smell (it really is stinky and the entire smells like stinky tofu), but I was so glad to try it out!! There was something special about the texture and a hint of pungency that made me keep eating the dish. The sauce and pickled veggies were much needed to cut off the greasiness of deep-fried tofu. 
We also got beef brisket and tendon noodles. Noodles were hand-pulled which were pleasantly chewy. The broth was nice and flavorful. The best part of the noodle was meat and tendon. They were well seasoned and tender. 

Service was friendly and quick. Reasonable price (stinky tofu was $7.99 which is good for sharing, and noodles ranged from $7-10 depending on the size and the type) Cash and debit only just for the heads up!! 

Overall, had a pleasant experience at Mei Nung Beef Noodle House. I will be craving for stinky tofu soon :D Although the noodle was good, for me, stinky tofu really was the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"I needed a nice bowl of noodles and this place had the reviews to support my choice. I walked in the door, and was hit with the aroma of the Stinky Tofu. Interesting dish: the aroma is so powerful it permeated the room. It is also aptly named, since it smells like a sewer backed up. 

I ordered a bowl of noodles with beef and vegetables. I thought it would be more of a traditional soup, but it had far less broth and more concentrated flavour. 

The noodles appear to be hand pulled, not the general packaged noodles you might be familiar with. Overall, a delicious dish, providing you can get past the stinky tofu..."}
{"text":"Small and 'stinky' place...No pun intended...Due to the stinky tofu which they offer.  By the way, you MUST order the stinky tofu because...JUST BECAUSE!  The noodle plates were alright.  I just wish the place was a tad bit bigger.  Felt kind of cramped there.  Would go back with just the wife next time, due to the fact that one of our friends in our party of six did not like the scent of the stinky tofu.  =P"}
{"text":"The food at this place is so good. I stopped by with my family on vacation, and I really enjoyed my lunch at this restaurant. We got two orders of stinky tofu, two different beef noodle soups, fish balls with meat, and three side dishes. The stinky tofu was amazing! It had the perfect deep fried texture, and the sauce they use with it is so good. I couldn't stop myself from eating more and more pieces until it was all gone. It does not at all taste like it smells (thank god), so hopefully that doesn't deter people from trying it. The beef noodle soup was also amazing. When I originally saw the menu and noticed they offer their beef soup by itself, I thought it was a bit odd... but I totally understood why after trying the soup. The soup is so flavorful, and it would be delicious even if consumed on its own. The noodles used in the soup were very soft.  The beef and the beef tripe were good too. The fish balls with meat could've tasted better. It wasn't bad, but I probably wouldn't order it again. All of the ingredients tasted pretty fresh, but I found myself underwhelmed with the flavors in general. The side dishes were decent. We ordered the cucumbers, pig ears, and seaweed strips. Of the 3, I liked the cucumbers the most.

The service at this restaurant was fine. The prices overall were very reasonable. The smell of the restaurant was a little off-putting when I first walked in, but my nose adjusted to it pretty quickly. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely come here regularly for the stinky tofu and beef noodle soup. I'll be back the next time I'm in the area for sure. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"We were really full since we already had dim sum and mango bubble tea for dessert before going to this place.  It really was a complete accident since we were on our way out of the mall and smelled some stinky tofu.  We followed our noses and found this place.  I was a little hesitant to try it since I heard it was really pungent.  The one at this restaurant were pretty mild I think.  I will have to try the beef noodle soup next time.  Everyone was ordering it.  The guy next to us was slurping really loudly so it must be good."}
{"text":"As you're walking along the chain of restaurants of First Markham Place, you come across a pungent aroma coming out from a particular restaurant, but don't let that \"stink\" divert your direction as Mei Nung houses one of the best Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup in Toronto. 

Mei Nung can definitely be overlooked as another one of those beef noodle houses, but it is definitely not the case. The beef is prepared, braised, and marinated to the point where it is very tender and flavourful with every bite. The broth is very rich and savoury, combined with hand-made noodles that is cooked to perfection.

There are also options that does not include soup, but instead, combines with sesame oil, which I found to be another refreshing choice.

For the smelly tofu, the outer shell was still crispy when they served the dish and the tofu inside was still very firm. The sauce is 'sticky soy sauce'. The stinky tofu/smelly tofu and the pickled vegetables are exactly as I remember them from Taiwan. This stuff is legit!

You hardly even notice the smell once you're eating it. 

I came here many, many times, and will continue to be one their of loyal customers."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to get beef brisket noodles in Toronto. The smell of stinky tofu is quite strong but you will get used to it after sitting there for a while. I do not eat stinky tofu myself but others seem to enjoy it. I like their thousand year egg with tofu appetizer. Love that there is 10% off for Yelp users."}
{"text":"Quite busy for lunch. We order the beef noodle soup, fried tofu, appetizers, dumplings. Other reviewed previous Taiwanese restaurants not really my cup of tea either. Fried tofu was good on the other hand crispy. Appetizers were sadly flavor list as I ordered the pig's ear and seaweed.

Beef noodle soup had preserved vegetables in it also and had a weird sweet flavor if you like that sort of thing. The beef noodle soup should be at least good since it is one of this restaurant as its called beef noodle house.

I would not come back again."}
{"text":"First time here today and had the beef noodle in soup and the beef tripe noodle in soup with a side dish of preserved eggs and tofu. I was pretty amazed at the soup base being not too salty and full of flavor! The beef was made just right and the noodles are al dente ! The place smells like the Chinese traditional \"stinky tofu\" but the food was amazing despite the smell. 

Would definitely come back again and recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some good beef noodle soup, I highly recommend giving this place a try. 

This restaurant is small and casual but don't let this fool you. Mei Nung is one of my top places to visit for beef noodle soup. The beef is consistently tender and flavorful. The noodles are al dente. 

The service is adequate. Prices are great. Food is great. The only downside is that this restaurant has a strong smell of stinky tofu. If you are able to eat with this smell, then you should be fine visiting."}
{"text":"We walked into this place because the pungent aroma emanating from here to the parking lot attracted us. This joint is all about the Taiwan-style beef noodle, hence its name, \"Mei Nung Beef Noodle House,\" and I'm guessing that that was beef noodle that we could smell from the outside too. We actually came here on our last day in Toronto and we were on a mission to try to eat as much of the good food as we can before we headed back. This was the first stop before we went to Ding Tai Fung, just a few storefronts down, so it was a quick stop.

First, we ordered the tofu with preserved eggs appetizer. It was chilled (supposed to be) but it was good. Then we split a bowl of homemade beef noodle soup and a bowl of homemade noodle with fried beef sauce among 4 people. After ordering, our waitress gave us a quizzical look, like the kind that says \"you guys are only ordering 2 bowls for 4 people??\" Yes, we are only ordering 2 bowls for 4 people. We are trying to save our stomach for our food binge later on.

Anyways, everything here was really good. I liked the appetizer a lot and the beef noodle soup over the one with the sauce. I would come back here again next time, hopefully for more than 15 minutes and I get my own bowl myself too."}
{"text":"Service is average as this is more of a quick pace, you eat then get out. Not very comfy to sit and have long talks. Their noodles are great in texture, a little chewy but soft still, thats what good noodles are. Their beef tendons and brisket are well cooked, it's soft since it has been slow cooked. The portion size of it are fairly big, one bowl is enough to make you really full. 

I also ordered the stinky tofu, it is not as authentic because I guess if they did serve it, it would be extremely stinky and not much people would be able to eat it. It is nicely fried with a sweet sauce on top.

I have been here more than once so I would recommend to my friends if they were looking to try something different. Only thing is they don't have a big menu to choose from so not a lot of variety."}
{"text":"We came in here on a Sunday for a table of 18, quickly set a table for us right away as it wasn't too busy. Broth was delicious, and so were beef brisket noodles with beef tendon. Tried their stinky tofu, and that was quite delicious as well. Definitely will be back, as prices were very reasonable as well. All in all, four swags out of five"}
{"text":"MMM This is a pretty great place to visit if you're craving the beef noodle soup with great textures of noodles and a flavourful base! They also offer up other small side dishes that are worth trying out if you're into tofu and what not. I personally don't like tofu, but I did try the stinky tofu, a Chinese favourite apparently. You can smell them in the parking lot.. It really is quite stinky, but tastes pretty nice actually. I still do not like tofu so I just come for some really delicious noodles.

The noodles themselves are chewy and thicker since they make them homemade. I really appreciate a place that makes their own noodles and broth, rather than some flavour pack and pre-packaged ramen noodles or something. :) 

I wouldn't say that it's the best noodles out there or that the flavours are all that special, but it hits the spot and at a great price too! Parking is hell though because it is FMP, so arrive early, and be patient. People are always leaving, so it's just a matter of hunting down a lane. =P"}
{"text":"This place stinks. Stinks of smelly toufu. If you can handle the stinky aroma then you can sit down and enjoy one of the best braised beef noodle soup Toronto has to offer. Not many people can as I've seen some customers turn away as soon as they open the door and face the aroma. 

This is my third visit to the location and everytime I either order the braised beef noodle soup or the the braised beef noodle soup with tendons large. The noodles are handmade and chewy, broth flavorful and the meat tender. $9.99 before tax and if you check in you get a 10% discount, pay by cash only."}
{"text":"Markham staple. Awesome experience eating their beef noodle soup every time I'm here. Never change!"}
{"text":"Decent noodles.  Large portions.  Flavor was alright.  The stinky tofu wasn't stinky but reasonable for the non-stinky kind."}
{"text":"Beef Noodle Soup - beef is fall-apart-in-your mouth tender! Noodles are good, soup is flavorful. 

Ordered green vegetables (A-Choi), cooked in a tasty sauce. 

Will be back to try their stinky tofu! (note: the restaurant smells like stinky tofu)

Closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Good to try one but won't come back. Service was ok. Not a fan of this dark beef soup. The noodles was chewy and beef/tendon was tender/juicy. Stinky Tofu is over rated and would never order it again. I would rather eat the normal tofu at a normal chinese restaurant like Congee Wong."}
{"text":"We're from U.S.. We came here twice specifically for the stinky tofu. We ordered 4 plates of fried sticky tofu, and I had to nibble slowly so that I can enjoy the smell and taste  of the fermented tofu. I had tried many places but this one by far the best."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for lunch. As soon as I walked in the strong aroma of stinky tofu was rushing towards me. 

This was my 2nd time here, I order the same thing beef, beef tendon noodle soup L (8.95). The soup was very rich in beef taste, the noodles are very al dente and the beef is very flavourful. I been to many beef noodle soup places and this is one of the better one. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Located within First Markham place, this restaurant is one that should be visited at least once. Parking is a little limited depending on what time you go - FMP is crowded most days.

They offer beef noodles and stinky tofu made in-house, consistent every time. The prices are reasonable and the food really fills your up. I've been here quite a few times and the service and food are very consistent (except that one time they gave me an XL instead of the S I ordered - but hey, no extra charge!). We love their stinky tofu and pickled cucumber side dish. Noodles are chewy and the soup is flavorful. Some come with marinated egg, which I also quite enjoy. 

Would return with friends anytime."}
{"text":"This simple beef noodle join is a go to for yummy soup. You have to bare with the strong scent of stinky tofu. The sticky tofu is an acquired taste... one that I can't stomach. I put up with the smell because I like the soup that much! Fast service and a cheap meal for under $10 bucks!"}
{"text":"I was craving beef noodle soup for a while. Being in SF and NYC, there hasn't been a place that has been THAT amazing for beef noodle soup. Luckily, I showed up at Mei Nung after hanging out with some friends in Markham. They have some amazing beef noodle soup and stinky tofu (if you enjoy such foods). 

Warning you now though - you will be extremely full after eating everything!"}
{"text":"Yummy authentic Taiwanese stinky tofu and beef brisket noodle place.  It's my go to place whenever I crave for the above items. Please beware:  this place smells-the stinky tofu smell will stay with you after you finish your meal.  Service is typical Asian fast food style-fast & efficient.  You can't miss the beef brisket noodle if you come here-noodle was chewy and beef brisket full of flavors.  A 3.5 star, half a star deducted for the smell-cos every time I come here I have to think about if I'm going anywhere else afterwards."}
{"text":"Following the advice of fellow yelpers, I decided to try this noodle place.

Seems like it's known for its noodle soups, so I decided to try the beef noodle with some tripe. First of all, I like that they separate the tendon from the meat on the menu - that means that when you buy the beef bowl, they don't give you any tendons and vice versa. I don't like it when you get the beef bowl and most of it is tendon. The meat itself was well marinated, and good star anise flavor. The broth was thick (i.e. not watered down) and dark brown - just the way I like it! It has a slightly sour tone, which might be from some pickled vegetables they add in. The tripe (cow stomach) was cooked very nicely - elastic without being too tough or chewy to bite through. The noodles are great too - bouncy doughy texture to it and absorbed some of the broth's taste.

Points for not charging extra for a to-go bowl! Service was quick.

BUT fyi - the prices have increased to about 7.50 for a small and 8.50 for a large."}
{"text":"If you can't stand the smell of stinky tofu then don't come here. Otherwise come enjoy some hot and tasty beef noodle soup while trying to cover your nostrils. Basically the whole restaurant smells like stinky tofu since they cook a lot in the kitchen but if you can get over the smell, the beef noodle soup is pretty dang good. I also ate the stinky tofu but there was nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Beef and tendon noodle was great! Portions of meat were generous and soup base was legit.  Noodles were also extraordinary! All in all, it was an impressive bowl of Taiwanese style noodle soup.

We came in at a busy time, so wait times were about 20minutes and they were really understaffed.  But for the price, it was expected."}
{"text":"We want to have a quick meal before badminton and decided to eat here.  The place is not renovated with the stingy tofu smell.  If you can't take the smell, you might not like to eat there.  We ordered the beef noodle.  The food came out at decent time.  The soup is good and the portion is generous.  The beef is tender and easy to chew.  We even got 10% off from our bill.  We definitely come here again."}
{"text":"If you have ever been to First Markham Place on a hot summer day, you might remember a distinctive rotting like smell. For those not familiar with that smell, it's stinky tofu. Pretty popular stuff in Taiwan I think, and maybe some other parts of Asia. I remember having it in Hong Kong. Each place's stinky tofu tasted and smell a little different.

With all that been said, I personally don't think Mei Nung is best known for stinky tofu. I like the beef noodles more. You can choose different beef toppings like beef tendon, tripe, or just chunky tendon beef. Sometime you can mix some of them, I believe there is beef/tendon mix. The beef broth is full of beefy flavour and bits of sour salty preserve vegetable is great to go along with the bowl of beefy goodness! Noodle is always the right texture too. This is a Taiwanese restaurant so there are other known taiwanese dishes too that's worth a try.

The inside of the restaurant smell bad, smells like stinky tofu, so be warn. Somedays it smell worst than others, but you'll most likely walk out of there with a stinky smell attached to your clothing. I don't mind it that much anymore, I've gotten use to it, it's an acquired taste.

Taste ****
Price ****
Portion *****"}
{"text":"Mei Nung never lets me down!

Every so often I get a craving for stinky tofu and this is the place I go to get it! No one goes here for the ambience, but you know from the smell that hits you as soon as you walk in, that this stinky tofu is authentic! The noodles are also amazing - chewy noodles in rich broth, with a healthy serving of brisket and tendon. I am definitely a repeat customer! It also helps that the middle aged lady (owner?) who is always there is super friendly.

PS. I would definitely give 5 stars if the prices were a little lower.. Kind of high seeing as the rest of Markham charges a little less."}
{"text":"Since Mama Bear closed down, this is the next best place for stinky tofu! Come in only if you can stand the smell lol

Noodles are heavy and gets you full quickly. I can never finish a small myself. Side dishes are also a big hit!

{"text":"If you like beef, then this is the place to go. The soup base is fantastic, the homemade noodles are perfectly done, and the beef / beef tendon are great. They have a wide variety of side dishes that go well with the beef noodles. 

If you prefer, trade out the noodles for dumplings, which are also pretty good (a bit doughy). 

Also, they play 90s canto-pop, which is worth a star."}
{"text":"It's good, not a lot of selections, but hey it's a beef noodle house for a reason.

The broth is excellent. Well obviously, you can smell it once you go in! The noodles are homemade and fresh as well. Their bok choy is juicy and succulent as well (this is coming from someone who is not a fan of vegetables!). Their beef is chewy, and that's beef and their beef cowheels (their other beef option) as well!

I wouldn't bother with drinks, just drink the tea they have.

Oh, expect about a 10+ minute wait for your food. They're low on servers at most times."}
{"text":"Slightly lumpy, non-conforming noodles. Bathed in less than salty, savoury beef broth. Topped with over boiled bok Choy.

Add spoonful of chilli sauce, and you've got yourself some good eats. 

Mei Nung delivers a consistent meal each and every time. 

Parking is hellish, and wait times are expected. 

4/5 would spoon chilli sauce again"}
{"text":"Big portions even for a small, affordable priced and you could smell the stench of stinky tofu right when you enter the restaurant....I couldn't order it because my gf wouldn't allow me too -____-

The quality of the food was mediocre, found the beef to be a bit too chewy and the broth was too salty...had to run to a boba place inside fmp to get myself hydrated 

Btw the 10% check in discount works here"}
{"text":"If you want Taiwanese Beef noodle, this is the place!  There is no other in GTA that can compete with this place, the noodle texture, the soup flavor, the quantity and tenderness of beef, it's all there.  Not crazy about the other flavor of noodles, but the beef noodle is what this place is famous for.
If you want Taiwanese stinky tofu, this is also the place!  Forget the other places that offers it like Papa Chang, Mama Bear, they don't have the stinkiness that this place offers.  Now I am not saying that this taste just like the ones you get from the streets of Taiwan, but it's the best you can get in the GTA.

I give this place a 8 out of 10."}
{"text":"So rare to find stinky tofu. It won't be as good as Taipei night market but good enough for toronto. I don't like their beef noodle soup. There's many good variations elsewhere. But this is a reliable restaurant if u like it."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this restaurant for the past few years. Unfortunately, I have also seen the prices go up almost every time I visit. The menu is very simple but this should not be a worry as most people order the signature beef noodles (my order every time!) I love the homemade noodles coupled with the flavourful soup, well braised beef and garnished with pickled veggies. They also offer stinky tofu here so beware of the strong aroma when you enter. Overall, if you want a fast meal and are a noodle-lover like myself, give this place a try! It is quite a small restaurant so try to avoid rush hour times if you can!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of the stinky tofu smell, so I order take out from this place, highly recommend their beef noodle soup!"}
{"text":"My fave beef noodle place. Place does smell horrible since they make stinky tofu. But their noodles, beef, soups,  dumplings,  veggies, stinky tofu and tofu with preserved eggs are all great.  One waitress gives superb service wine the other one loses sight of customer-oriented service. Be prepared to do laundry after a meal there."}

{"text":"Pros:
Very good bowl of beef noodle
Variety of beef noodle options

Cons:
Parking might be hard to find during peak hours

Being a lover of beef noodle, I can't believe I have not reviewed this place before.  Better late than never I guess.  If you love Taiwanese beef noodle. you definitely need to give Mei Nung a try.

Mei Nung is located inside First Markham place.  If you've ever been to this place during peak times, you know parking is a pain in the you know what.  Just keep that in mind when you come to this place.  OK, now on to the good parts!

Mei Nung offers a variety of different types of beef noodle.  Most places usually offer the one bowl name braised beef noodle.  Mei Nung gives you the option of having different types of beef in your noodle. They also have some dry noodle options for days where you're not feeling soup.  This is something I really like about this place.  Some people like fattier cuts of beef and some people the leaner cuts.  Mei Nung has something to satisfy every beef noodle lover.  The dry noodles are great when it's hot and I don't want a hot bowl of soup.

The first time I came here long ago, I found the broth a little on the saltier side.  Recently I've noticed that they've toned down the sodium levels while still maintaining great flavour to the broth!!  Yay!!

The staff working while I was there with my 2 little ones were extremely helpful and patient.  Even though the place is on the small side, they do have a good amount of seats and turnover at this place is usually very quick so long wait times are a rare occurrence.

I really like Mei Nung.  It's one of my go to spots for beef noodle cravings.  As long as you are OK with the occasional smelly tofu order, you've got nothing to worry about!"}
{"text":"Still a 5 star rating!!! Food consistently tastes great! Service is fast. Staffs are friendly and always alert. It was a busy friday night, my son drop one of his chopsticks, a few seconds later, without even asking, here comes a new pair. Wow! 

Our go to place for beef noodle soup and dumplings. Our comfort food.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I came here for stinky tofu. I got my stinky tofu. It was alright. I also god a clear noodle soup and a dry noodle dish. Everything here was just alright for me. I wouldn't travel all the way here any time soon but if I was around the area and I have no idea what I want to eat THEN I'll come back to this restaurant. I think the food here just isn't up my alley but the restaurant itself is fine."}
{"text":"This place has delicious taiwanese beef with noodles and broth! I have come here many times as it is a quiet little restaurant.

They serve stinky tofu here which I understand is not for everyone, and the smell can really seep into your hair and clothing..but if it is for you, it certainly beats lining up for an hour at Night It Up!

They offer regular and large bowls of noodles for reasonable prices (around $7-8)."}
{"text":"This is our third time here to this store. The first and second time were great (last year)..but our recent visit is kind of disappointing.
We ordered the beef tendon noodles and stinky tofu as usual. This time. the soup is close to tasteless. The sticky tofu is pretty much the same, definitely not an authentic one but better than nothing. I love their cabbage pickle out of the whole dish. Though, It went downhill for everything we ordered. We will still come back later and hope it will get improved sometime later."}
{"text":"Classic place. Consistent broth, meat texture and flavor, and add-ons. Nothing changes, but that's a good thing. I've always found their noodles a bit too doughy for my taste. The texture doesn't have enough bounce/gluten."}
{"text":"Smells like stinky tofu with poor ventilation (that's literally it)

The noodles and beef were salty and sour. Would not try again"}
{"text":"If you can get past the smell then you'll soon discover the glorious beef noodle. By far one of the best Taiwanese noodle restaurant in GTA. One of my go to spots when I'm in Markham. You can tell it's good because it's always packed on the weekends and on some weekday nights. The beef noodle is great because of the texture of the noodle and the flavor of the soup. The beef is tender and not chewy. Bean sauce noodle is a great alternative if you're not into soup noodle. Sauce can be a tad salty if you don't mix it thoroughly with the noodle before you endulge. You'd be a fool to walk out without ordering the stinky tofu. It's cleaner than the ones you purchase on street markets or Night It Up. If you can't handle the smell then you've clearly never tried the ones in Mongkok,  Hong Kong. The mother land of stinky tofu. The government had to tell the restaurants to tone it down because the scent was so strong. Be sure to bring a friend because I can be quite filling to eat it alone."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this rare instance of a Taiwanese restaurant for years (there was a Taiwanese restaurant nearer to Bayview on Highway 7, but they closed years ago) and despite their beef noodle broth options being a little less flavourful than previous years they still offer great 'wet' and 'dry' beef noodle dishes.

Also on the menu are thousand year old eggs (duck...) and smelly tofu. The latter comes with tofu and katsuoboshi. The former comes with some sweet sauce, which is the Taiwanese style of doing it. However, the tables have chili and hot sauce to add to the tofu and cabbage.

The service is prompt and fine.

One major note: there seems to be a perception that this restaurant offers stinky tofu. It does not. What they do have is a slightly pickled tofu they call smelly tofu, which is milder than stinky tofu. It is not possible to find Stinky Tofu in the area since Mama Bear closed. 
People like to review things (see: Millie's 'Japanese' crepes) and bestow authenticity or adjectives to it, but often the information is wrong. That is the case here.

Finally, this plaza is absolutely the worst for parking. Finding parking is nearly impossible - and that's after they closed down the cinema! Solution: cook at home? Public transit? Jet pack? Drive to Vaughan Mills and you will feel good about this plaza in comparison? Let me know..."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for a while, but finally had a chance after a Yelp Event in the area.

I ordered the Beef Brisket/Tendon with Homemade Noodle in soup and it was just alright.  Noodles did seem homemade and were chewy, just the way I like them.  Brisket/Tendon were cooked nicely, tender.  I found the soup to be a bit sour which put me off.

Not sure if what I've been eating has been authentic or not, but it definitely HASN'T been \"sour\" and I prefer something that's just savoury.

Service:  Your standard, efficient, no nonsense or pleasantries-type Canto.

Warning:  If you smell something like not-so-fresh lady parts, that's the stinky tofu...I think.  I couldn't really get over the smell enough to order it!"}
{"text":"broth is very tasty and beef is tender. The best beef noodle soup I've ever had in GT A. However the noodles are a bit undercooked."}
{"text":"Noodle texture was amazing but there was a very pungent smell upon arrival. It straight up stunk. Once we got use to the smell the noodles and soup was good. Just wish they had more flavours."}
{"text":"Niu-rou mian, soup is fat-less, tasty broth with some greens and seasoning.  Meat is lean and fat-less - no gristly pieces of anything to remove.  Noodles are well-prepared.  I added some very la hot seasoning and it gave the soup a massive zing.

Now for the stinky tofu.  Firstly, it didn't stink that bad and tasted delish.  They coat it with a good brown slightly sweet drizzle (kind of like Japanese katsu sauce) and there are vinegary pickles on the side.

Service is brisk, ambience is very plain, designed to eat, enjoy, pay and leave and to give your table to someone waiting in line.

As always, nice experience.  Quiet place."}
{"text":"I come here once a month with my family for the stinky tofu. We love it! Of course, we also love the beef noodle and the appetizers. Our favorite is the pig's ears, beef stomach,  and spiced boiled egg."}
{"text":"I want stinky tofu but don't want to lineup during night market, so this is where I go.  If u don't like the stinky smell, don't even think about dining in this restaurant.  The portion of the tofu is quite big, so u must have someone willing to share with u.  Although my hubby hate the smell, still he's willing to share w/me ^^.  The tofu is hot, crispy and not oily, love it!  I like the taste of sesame noodle with beef, but usually near to the end of the bowl, u will find the sauce stick in between your throat, so I prefer more watery in the sauce.  I think the portion is fair vs the price."}
{"text":"I found myself here because of a challenge of sorts. My mission was to eat stinky tofu , though I also had some beef noodle dish .

Stinky Tofu is a weird dish, it smells like sweaty wet socks and for moment - towards the end - tasty like it also. But somewhere in the middle of that \"experience\" you get this nice taste of the tofu and sauce they drizzle on it. Will I try it again? Maybe. 

But the beef noodle soup there was too notch, the noodles alone made it worth while. The beef used in it was tender, and most importantly full of flavor. 

This place has great noodles"}
{"text":"Menu is quite simple. I opted for tripe noodle soup while the others at my table had the had beef and the tendon noodle soup. 

The homemade noodles are thick and chewy. Its a very pleasant texture for me. The soup is tangy, has a little bit of spice and has subtle flavours of star anise and cloves. 

I forgot to take pictures because after my first bite of the noodles, I was so drawn in.

Great place for some beef noodle soup!"}
{"text":"I used to come here pretty often few years ago...
Recently visited again for the stinky tofu and their well known beef noodle.
I don't know why, maybe it's more recent, but as I walk into here, it smells funny, almost like a public washroom, and trust me, it's not the stinky tofu smell.  

The service is horrible the last time I went here, as if I was interrupting them to take my order, and the food just didn't taste as good as it used to anymore.  

Won't be coming back anymore... So disappointed..."}
{"text":"3.5* 
Came for lunch, attentive and fast service even with a full house. Didn't get any weird smells on today's visit. 

Broth: 4*for clarity, balance and flavour

Beef: 3* got 5 pieces in my small order, it all needed more time for the beef and tendon pieces to braise and break down to that soft goodness people come for. 

Veg: excited as it looked like 3 big pieces of Bok Choy but was just 3 leaves!

Noodles: 5*, big round fresh noodles with perfect chew

Decor: can't eat it as a fellow Yelper said, so not important! 

I was hoping for a similar experience to my favourite noodle joint(msg me for that place) but it missed the ball on spice and beef softness.

Would visit again, but not the first choice when craving this type of noodle.

***It's been a few hours after lunch and I am parched for water, MSG warning to those sensitive***"}
{"text":"Short and sweet review. So. STINKY. But once you get used to the smell, you'll love the noodles here.

First off, before you even go here, I'd suggest you to not wear your best clothes/jacket. Or even bringing your bag. Unless stinky tofu is your personal scent.

As soon as you are in the vicinity of this restaurant, you can smell what's coming out of it. Open the door and a wind of stinky tofu will blow all over your face. For stinky tofu lovers (not moi) this will be your heaven. For others, just bear with it for a few minutes.. you'll grow immune to the smell soon.

As a soup and noodle lover, it's expected that I'd order the braised beef noodle. It is SO. GOOD. The soup is nice and rich, but not salty. Noodles are so chewy, but not raw. And plenty of meat there. I could've probably eaten at least 3 bowls of these..."}
{"text":"Great flavour booth, great texture on noodles, tender beef! And that red spicy paste on the table, watch out, it's delicious and spicy (seriously, its spicy! Start off light, work your way up) 
Now if you don't like the smell of stinky tofu, you shouldn't dine in, get take out. You can smell the stinky tofu from outside the restaurant. Yes it smells, but it's amazingly good. At the end of the day, it's deep fried. How can you not love deep fried food! Oh don't forget to dip tofu into that red spicy paste (yes I love it that much!)"}
{"text":"We ordered 4 different kinds of noodle dishes and dumplings and stinky tofu. 

For the noodle dishes, broth was nice, meat was average and noodle was a bit under cooked. So if you like soft noodles, you probably won't appreciate their noodle. 

Dumplings was good and the dumpling size was bigger than average dumpling size. 

I had high expectation for the stinky tofu because almost every table ordered it. But it was very average. It's not stinky enough and the middle was too condense."}
{"text":"I got to say this restaurant is my ultimate preggers craving. I'm probably there at least once a week!!! Poor husband is probably sick of it lol

Once you step inside this restaurant, you immediately get hit with the smell of stinky tofu. No body seems to mind this smell. 

The place is small and has a great turn over rate so you don't have to wait too long when there is a line up at the door. It's very kid friendly and they offer FREE WIFI if you bring your iPad/ tablet for your kids. 

I usually order the minced meat noodle in soup and my husband orders the beef with tendon noodle soup. Amazing! We also enjoy ah Choy too sometimes. 

The noodles are chewy and the soup is perfectly hot! I love how complex the flavour of the soup is yet so simple and good. 

I am obsessed over the SPICY CHILLI SAUCE - it's spicy so don't got crazy with it lol

If you ever want to try something new, try this place. You definitely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is actually so conflicting.  The place smells SO BAD but it's SO GOOD LOL 
I think bc I've watched Chinese shows all my life that praises how smelly the stinky tofu is ... I've been conditioned to like it.

My boyfriend on the other hand ... he was about to faint from trying not to breathe.

The noodles were very average, I feel like there's a shit ton of soy sauce in there but the beef ingredients were not skimpy.  

The workers are very Chinese-oriented service aka cellphones.  But they do respond promptly.

I'll definitely come back with my brother and my mom.

PS. Cash Only."}
{"text":"My favourite place for authentic Taiwanese beef noodles and stinky tofu. I come here maybe once a month to satiate my beef noodle craving.

Don't let the initial blast of stinky tofu smell scare you off from this place! Their beef noodle soup is really yummy. The noodles are nice and chewy, broth is seasoned with delicious spices, and the beef is super tender.

I've tried almost everything on their menu and they're all tasty Taiwanese comfort food. 

My friends, who have never tried it before, all agreed that this place exceeded their expectations when we brought them over."}
{"text":"If you don't like the smell of stinky tofu, you need to stay away! lol otherwise, their food is pretty good. Though i'm not a big fan of stinky tofu, I will still come here for their beef + tendon noodle."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????
??????3?order???????????????????????????????????????????????\"????\"?

??????????????????????????????????! ???????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I love taiwanese beef noodles. I remember I came here with some colleagues of mine. We were all new hires and since I work close to first markham place, I offered to show them some good asian eats. They loved it and we were absolutely stuffed, we all wanted to take naps for the rest of our shift. I on the other hand, wasn't as impressed as them. I feel like it was good, but I've had better. I would come back though."}
{"text":"I like Stinky tofu the best from this place. When I have craving for Stinky tofu, this is the place I go to.  I'm not a big fan of their beef noodles soup though to be honest."}
{"text":"I loved their homemade noodles very al dente.  I came to this place about 30 mins before closing.  I would give it a 4 if they didn't start mopping the floor. The cleaning odor was overpowering so I didn't fully enjoy my meal. 

Stinky tofu - not authentic compared to the ones in HK. I guess you can't have it here if you want your customers to come back."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this place reeks of stinky tofu. As you can tell I'm not a fan. Over time you get accustomed to the smell, but it's always there. The beef noodle soup is just average in my opinion. The soup isn't particularly tasty and the noodles are nothing to write home about. If you have a particular need to eat Taiwanese beef noodle soup then I'd say this place will probably meet your needs. They do have much more than just that. In addition to the many varieties, they offer it in several different forms and have a selection of side dishes."}
{"text":"Mei Nung Beef Noodle House is located at the outer strip of First Markham Place which is famous for their home made beef noodle soup in Taiwanese Style.

When I entered the restaurant, I can smell the really strong beefy soup smell. This is a good sign as hopefully the soup will taste as good as it smell.

I ordered the Large Beef Noodle Soup ($6.99). There are no lunch specials. It took around 10 minutes for my order to arrive as the noodles does take time to be cook. The broth does taste rich with just a hint of spicy... too timid for me, however you can make it more spicy by putting the spicy soy bean sauce and the hot sauce in. The beef is chunky and plentiful. 

I have to comment on the noodle, Yes, it is different than the other restaurants since it is cooked more al dente and has more a chewy texture. It does give me a sense of more fullfilling than usual.

There is only 1 waitress during lunch hour, so service can be a little slow. 

Cash only."}
{"text":"We ordered Signature beef broth noodles and fried stinky toufu.You will love the stinky toufu so good~ Sauce is fantastic~~~~~"}
{"text":"Great value! Noodles are some of the best IMHO. Broth is not too salty and has lots of flavour. Beef is the tender and plentiful. Would recommend and have repeated plenty of times."}
{"text":"Like everyone said, the place reeks of smelly tofu! At first I thought I wouldn't be able to stand it throughout, but after awhile it sets in and you forget about it when you dig into your meal. The place is a little small and the tables are a little tight, but it's a eat your meal quick  and go place. 

Their selection consists of mainly noodle dishes. The soup base is a little sour but is very flavourful. Sesame paste noodle with tendon was super good. The noodles are thick and pretty chewy. The service for food is very fast and the portions are good for what you pay."}
{"text":"The stinky tofu. Oh man. Never have I ever, nor shall I ever doubt there is a glorious upside to every unattractive, unappealing, even gross offering. There is definitely more than meets the eye when it comes to \"stinky tofu\". 

Think: kimchi, nuc mum, shrimp paste, preserved bean curd, curd, cheese, aged anything, balut... the good ol'king of foul odor that has render nations to surrender \"Durian\". 

Stinky tofu is no more or less than any of the above mentioned. It's acquired. But my first introduction was rude and gross because maybe it was timing, maybe it was the actual product that was less than stellar. 

At Mei's, they do Stinky Tofu justice. Sweet, crunchy with the perfect accompaniment of oyster sauce, it exudes jus the perfect amount of sweet funk that is actually pleasant and not in the least offensive. We had this twice, when we should have had this five more times. 

Other stuff were decent but all I can and want to remember is their Stinky yummy tofu."}
{"text":"I was bridled by hunger after a hideous training/work-out that I just have to suck it in for some noodle soup.  And the `risk` was well rewarded.  Why the risk?  Because I had a huge hesitation to go to this place because of Stinky Tofu.  I just couldn`t take it and I can smell it right at the parking lot.  Too bad I couldn't agree with most of you who love Stinky Tofu and celebrate with the mere mention of it, my husband in the crowd with y'all. 

The noodles strike me as freshly made with its thick succulent sweet goodness; the beef slices were chunky and tender with sumptuous flavour; the veggies a good mix, and the base soup came from heaven!  A small order was enough to fill me up.  And my family loved their beef and fishballs soups.  Its also unusual for my kids to finish a bowl each.

Mei Nung Noodle House redefined my standards for a truly satisfying and delicious noodle soup.  Love, love, love it!  

And yes, a lot of stinky tofu dishes were served in other tables and this young couple next to us was enjoying a huge plate of it.  But their little girl was like me, and I felt her.  I managed to keep a straight face by enjoying those moments when all I can smell was the noodle soup under my nose. Cheers!"}
{"text":"As traditions \"evolve\", perhaps authentic beef noodle ceases to exist. In Toronto, there are certainly beef noodles that triumphs in each category: beef, noodle and broth. Yes..I have a beef guy, a noodle guy and a broth guy. However, I believe Mei Nung Noodle House has the best overall beef noodles. Bold broth, hand cut noodles, finely chopped pickled cabbage and tender succulent beef with delicious tendons. This owner employs enough slaves in the back kitchen to create a bowl of $5.99 goodness. I would eat it even if it is 42 degrees outside. 

The only issue may be the pungent aroma of stinky tofu for those who are not accustom to the smell. Mei Nung Beef Noodle House is worth the suffering. You will be redeemed!"}
{"text":"I got the most disgusting beef tendon soup!!! Grossssss! Not only does the food suck, their restaurant decoration was also stupid."}
{"text":"Stinky tofu was crispy, however it was too salty for my liking.
Beef noodle broth was flavourful. Price is very reasonable and they will give u 10% off with yelp coupon."}
{"text":"I may have pass by this place at First Markham place million of time but have never been due to the pungent smell of stinky tofu... don't get me wrong, I love stinky tofu but when it's in a restaurant/enclose area, the smell will just stick on you the rest of the day which I hate. I finally decided to try Mei Nung Beef Noodle () since I was desperate for a good bowl of Taiwanese Beef Noodle and heard that was the place to go.

Homemade Beef & Beef Tendon Noodle Soup ($7.99 Large)
~ This is probably the best Taiwanese Beef Noodle I had in Toronto; the soup was bold and flavorful, the noodle are homemade and hand cut, beef and tendons moist flavorful melt in your mouth good and the pickled cabbage is finely chopped which awakens your taste bud with it's acidity.

Homemade Beef & Beef Tendon Noodle w/ Fried Bean Sauce ($6.99 Small)
~Both of us usually prefer the soup version but for this post sake, we decided to order something different. This one is without sauce instead it's top with a very flavorful fried bean sauce and bean sprouts. This will definitely be better for the hotter summer days since it's not hot as the soup version.

Deep Fried Stinky Tofu ($6.99)
~ Since my clothes smell of it already, why not eat it as well =P
~ This is the Taiwanese style stinky tofu where they serve it with pickled cabbage on the side. (I tend to prefer the Hong Kong version which has a more golden color and top w/plenty of chili and hoisin sauce, see it here). This was quite a large portion compare to the ones we get at the Night Market and the 2 of us could barely finish it after the noodle.
~ Love to top the stinky tofu with extra chili sauce ;)

 Verdict :
Best Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup in Toronto 
Now that I tried it, I will be back in spite of the stink"}
{"text":"My mom and I both wanted to try Mei Nung Beef Noodle House for different reasons. I was desperately craving a good bowl of Taiwanese beef noodles, while she was looking forward to stinky tofu, which she harbours a deep love for. One step inside, we knew we were at the right place as the stench of the stinky tofu was quite unmistakable. Not that I had a problem with it, but stinky tofu is not for everyone. 

We started with two small dishes ($5.99 for two)- shredded seaweed strips and pig's ears. Both were rather mediocre and I would suggest skipping the side dishes altogether next time.

So of course we had the stinky tofu ($6.99), which came in a large heaping portion. Fortunately, this did not disappoint. The tofu here was substantial and firm on the inside, unlike the usual over-fried air pockets that we find at most night markets in Toronto. I loved that we could actually taste the tofu (and its stinky goodness), which we topped with extra chili sauce. Delish! 

We also ordered a small homemade beef and beef tendon noodle soup ($7.99 for large, $6.99 for small). I've read from several reviews that Mei Nung makes the best beef noodle soup in town. I haven't tried enough variations to concur with that statement, but this one was certainly delicious! First and foremost, the soup was excellent- bold and rich in flavours. I preferred the beef over the tendon as it was lean, yet moist. The hand cut noodles were pleasantly springy and didn't turn into mush after absorbing the broth. Overall, it was a bowl of comforting, soul-warming deliciousness that satisfied my cravings.  

If you can withstand that inevitable stinky stench, I highly recommend the Taiwanese beef noodles at Mei Nung. And if you're a fan of stinky tofu- well, more of a reason to come!"}
{"text":"While en route from our car to Ding Tai Fung, our group was stopped short by a waft carrying the distinctive aroma of stinky tofu.  Familiar to some and not to others, it was not part our itinerary but since we were in Markham to try things and good versions of this dish are hard to find in NYC, sure enough, we headed over here a few hours later.

Opening the door, we were almost physically hit by the stinky tofu aroma, which while funky, isn't really intolerable, and everyone got used to it.  The small, casual dining room was empty in the mid-afternoon we went, and we got settled into a table by the window.  Their specialty is actually Taiwainese-style beef noodle, but being already several meals into the day, we didn't order this.  We ordered what we came for, a plate of stinky tofu, and a few smaller accompaniments, marinated beef tripe and beef, both excellent small snacks.

I suppose stinky tofu is like durian (something I discovered I liked this Markham trip), foods with famously bad aromas that split everyone into fans or those who won't go near them.  Stinky tofu, which gets its odor from fermentation, has different regional styles, preparations, and condiments.  My first and best stinky tofu was had at a street stand in Beijing; whatever style that was featured rectangular cubes deep-fried for a light, crisp coating over a silky soft interior.  Tried again in Flushing, NY, which has a major Taiwanese population, but was sorely disappointed; can't describe it, I've apparently blocked the experience from my memory.  Mei Nung's version is probably Taiwanese style, deep fried triangular chunks that were golden and very nicely crispy, but the interior surprised me by being firm and somewhat spongy, with lots of air pockets giving it a mini-Swiss cheese look.  Tasted fine with the drizzled and extra sauces, well-made, but I prefer the soft texture tofu style.

I'd return here to try their beef noodle, and would recommend the stinky tofu as a good version."}
{"text":"Highly recommend: stinky tofu
Tip: check in using Yelp would get you 10% off
Summary: good portion, good service, really good food
Recommend: order try noodle rather than soup noodle, large portion

A group of us went to this place for dinner. When you entered the room, there is a strong smell of stinky tofu. We ordered a large bowl each, the portion is actually very large. We end up took half bowl to go.
The noodle soup is simply and done right. The noodles here are thick and very chewy. I really like this place. Probably would come back for stinky tofu or I want a classical beef noodle."}
{"text":"I remember when this place first opened up. My family was so excited to come here and have some good old, authentic, Taiwanese beef noodle soup. Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed. Fast forward many years... and surprise! We still come here. 

Why you may ask? 

Because the Taiwanese restaurants in Toronto are truly lacking. And as far as Toronto standards go, this place is decent. But it is nowhere close to the magnificent bowls of delicious beef noodle soup you can get in Taiwan. 

Mei Nung's beef doesn't melt in your mouth (but a true Taiwanese knows it should). Their soup is quite watered down, and the noodles are meh.

But whenever I crave my motherland's food, I come here. And then I always leave with the same disappointment, and the same \"it's not quite there\" feeling I always have. 

Until a better beef noodle soup place opens up in Toronto, this'll have to do."}
{"text":"Rating: 4/5
Aesthetics: 2/5
Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Recommendation: Stinky Tofu (try it!) and their Original Beef Noodle Soup

Definitely a fan of Taiwanese beef noodles ever since I came back from a trip a couple years back. This place does traditional very well and doesn't go over the top with making their dishes too traditional (to the point where Canadians would complain). I suggest this place if you're looking to try new things and a new cuisine that's rarer to find in Markham/ GTA. 

Taiwanese snacks are very popular, trying interesting foods such as pig ears or beef tripe will expand your palette. Items like Stinky Tofu are extremely popular but are more of an acquired taste - definitely worth a try though!

Not the prettiest place to go, but traditional food is generally like that anyways. If you're craving noodles - this is a place to go!"}
{"text":"In terms of food and the taste, this restaurant offers enough for your tastebuds to remain happy for the duration of the day. I used to frequent a lot more when the Cineplex existed here but not so much nowadays since FMP doesn't offer much in terms of entertainment. 

Last I got the homemade beef noodle which was decent, I guess. While it taste good I don't think it was very clean, and I know this because my stomach is prone to becoming upset upon eating unsanitary foods. It's alright for the price and it fills you up nonetheless so why not?

Servers can come off as rude sometimes but that might be because of the dinner rush. It gets pretty busy but it's not too bad considering I've experienced worser customer service in that plaza (i.e. Tracy's Dessert).

TLDR, I'd only come here if I was in the area but wouldn't visit just for the sake of having noodles you can get pretty much everywhere else."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here, just because the Tofu House was closed and I wanted to eat close by.  The welcome is a bit rude, as in the waitress just snubbed us.  I was feeling that if we don't get a table soon I may as well go to Ding Tai Fung as the fallback.

Eventually we did get a seat.

I got the Beef Noodle soup with no fixins small size for $5.99.  The amount of food was sufficient for my girth.  

The beef chunks were yummy, but a little tough if you have trouble chewing, though that didn't stop me since it does taste good.  Just had to use my hand to push up my jaw.  

The noodles were perfect for this type of dish.  A little chewy and al dente at the same time.  Feels hand made.

The soup was excellent, not too salty and I drank it all the way down like a ramen bowl.  I didn't care that I was in a Chinese restaurant it was that good.

The restaurant had three waiting staff, but they were very uncoordinated.  The tea refills didn't come right away.  So just because the service and welcome impression was bad, I deducted three stars.  However, the food was worth six stars because of the quality and price.

I will try to go three again when it is less busy maybe the service will be better and I can give this a better rating."}
{"text":"Solid taiwanese beef noodle soup
I come here for two items
Their beef noodles and stinky tofu

For their beef noodles
Great flavour in the broth
Noodles are tasty
Cuts of beef are tender
It just works so well together!!!
If you want to add some spice and more flavour, just put in one or two spoonful of the red chili sauce, it packs a punch and works beautifully

The stinky tofu is great
Always gotta match it with the pickled cabbage and chili sauce and brown sauce to compliment the flavours at fullest!

Only thing that does suck here
I dont know why but whatever they use to clean the tables and floors has a very strong smell
Like others mentioned, it smells like cleaning fluids, perhaps they did this to mask the terrible stinky tofu smell?
Personally dunno which is worse
I can ignore it once the food comes and you smell that beef broth
But i do know i feel bad for anyone i need to talk to face-to-face afterwards as the stinky breath is real! :p"}
{"text":"Yummmmm I finally made it here. Nobody wanted to come with me because of the smell. It smells awful the moment you open the door. It smells even worse when a table near you actually ORDERS the tofu.

You start to forget the smell in about 20 minutes. It takes a while...

The noodles are delicious!!!!! The soup especially is soooooo flavourful. Very salty towards the end, but when the noodles are soaked it's amazing. I had the Beef Tripe (the brown kind, ngao toh) and it was soft and NOT chewy, I loved it. 

The only companion willing to enter with me is my brother, an avid HK-er. He ordered the beef and tendon. The beef meat is super soft as well and flavourful. The tendons are large and generous!

The noodles are \"homemade\" but they're not the best I've had. They were decent. Still together with soup and meat, it's a delicious bowl of noodles for about $8-9.

None of the my clothes smell like the restaurant so I'll come back!

The restaurant seems echoey. Even with only a few tables of customers, it gets really loud."}
{"text":"The smell when you walk in through the doors smelt like you wash the floor with bleach. Was really strong. Didn't smell like stinky tofu. The food was alright. Nothing too spectacular. If you get rid of the smell. Than it would be better."}
{"text":"Soup was just right. The beef and tendon was excellent and tender. The noodle was great for what it is. The beef noodle soup is solid if you can stand the stinky tofu smell lingering."}
{"text":"This place offers homey Taiwanese beef noodles and stinky tofu. As the only place in GTA that I know of where you can get stinky tofu in itself deserves 4 stars, but they actually make it good and the garnishing they offer is tasty also. I wish they could even go further with their menu and provide different variants of stinky tofu like extra crispy or stinky tofu soup but I guess I can't complain"}
