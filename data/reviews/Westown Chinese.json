{"text":"Horrid... just horrid. Everything is all mushy and soggy. I could cook a better meal than this 30 bucks junks."}
{"text":"Tried this place again via just- eat. What a mistake! Every dish looks the same: breaded,soggy and covered with day glow sauce. Ordered crispy beef, which should be CRISPY! It should not be covered in a sauce to make it soggy. I truly wonder who is cooking there and if they have any concept of Chinese cuisine. Stars are for delivery and accuracy of my order. 0.5 stars for food,  at least didn't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"I ordered through Just-Eat, they had really good reviews (4/5 stars), apparently I should have Googled them. I ordered Shrimp Tom Yum Soup, it literally came with 3 tiny shrimp and the flavor was def not tom yum, it also had zucchini, carrots, celery, onion, I have never had Tom Yum soup with those veggies, usually comes with just mushrooms..  They included a single mushroom! Just 1! Weird... Ordered egg rolls which were totally bland, BBQ Pork Shanghai noodles that were bland and pork way over cooked and dry AF and the \"best\" out of the order was the General Tao Chicken which tasted alright but I asked for it to be SUPER EXTRA spicy and it hardly had any spice. Also, they sent chili oil which spilled all over everything.. I won't be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place, NEVER AGAIN.  Absolutely disgusting food, safe to say the worst Chinese food we've ever ordered, after thousands of deliveries, this one tops the list.

The rancid grease was very old and started hurting our throats halfway through our meal, and the burning pain didn't go away until late that night.  We tossed what was left on our plates and then dumped ALL of the leftovers, as well.

Almost ONE HUNDRED bucks down the drain.  A hundred bucks!!!! Are you kidding me?!!  It's so sad in this day and age of reviews and transparency that places like this get to stay open and continue to cheat people out of good money.  I wish I could give them a negative, but I *had* to give them one star.  Pfffftttt."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. The food was substandard at best. The pops didn't come so we had to call them back for it. For the price you're definatly not getting your money's worth. We will not be ordering here again."}
{"text":"I gave a scathing review on just-eat too. Alright first time ordering from the place. It was here in about 30 minutes, which is ok, considering i'm only 1 major street over). 
Food was cool, barely warm. Bill was $30 with tip. Pan fried dumplings were fine, but the sauce with it, just smelt BAD. General Tao's Chicken which is always more bread than chicken at any chinese joint I've ever had it from, was sweet, but no heat (its suppose to be a spicier dish), lastely, the Lo Mein with vegetables, had (and yes I counted), 2 broccoli flourrettes, 1 snow pea, 3 mushrooms, and 4 strings of carrots.  Again all dishes were cool by the time they got to me. 

SO All I can say is ....FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL!. OI. Never again. Period."}
{"text":"First time I ordered delivery and it took them 1 1/2 hrs. Ordered again tonight from their website and paid with a credit card, received a confirmation via email, called after waiting for 2 hours and they lost my order. They did nothing to remedy the situation - they do not deserve your business and have definitely lost mine."}
{"text":"Really bad. Really. Every dish tastes the same - salty and garlicky, and not in a good way. Spring rolls were so obviously the frozen kind. We ate a little, threw the rest out. What a waste of money"}
{"text":"Okay, so nothing about this place pretends to be something that it's not (except for the Japanese restaurant interior, I'm guessing that's what it may have been at some point). By looking at the menu/inside, one would never expect this to be anything more than what I call \"mall Chinese\" and by that I mean 90's food court Chinese food. The basics are there but nothing special. Truth be told I only came here because 1) the takeout pizza place next door doesn't have a washroom and 2) I was ravenous and needed to eat something before a concert and this was on the way. The place looks like it may be deserted (green pea pods spread out across a table in the dining area, well...at least they're not frozen?) but the server was friendly and quick and our meals came with a free bottle of water and free spring rolls. I had the chicken ball dinner for one and my friend had the lemon chicken dinner for one. We each got 2 spring rolls that came with it. The dinners were meh, but we didn't expect more than that. They bring you the food in a takeout container with plastic cutlery (easy if you want to take the rest with you). Unfortunately the spring rolls tasted like a chemical/cleaner of some sort. It was a bit horrifying, to be honest. Beware. We each took a bite and then left them on the plate. They were basically frozen ones that had been heated (the only ingredient in them seemed to be bean sprouts).  So I wouldn't come back here (especially when paying $10 for a meal that was less than mediocre) but if they put a bit of an effort into making the food fresh/interesting they could possibly get people in. As it stands it sort of feels like they're going out of business and just serving up what's left. But then again, what did you expect?"}
{"text":"The menu looked attractive. I wish the food tasted decent.  

Sorry to trash this place. However this is the worst Chinese food I ever tasted.  It was flavorless, greasy, and very bland.  Even with soy sauce, nothing could give it life. It was just bad."}
{"text":"Honestly, 

My bar to happiness with chinese takeout is fairly low. I'm not used to getting the highest quality food - and typically I'm fine with that. But this was hands down the worst chinese-takeout experience I've had in the city of Toronto.

First and foremost: AN ALLERGY WARNING WAS NOT ADHERED TO. I cook for a living. We distinctly specified an EGG allergy, and egg was included in dishes that could have easily omitted egg (Vegetable fried rice). Had I done such a thing as a young cook, I would have been fired. As a sous-chef, I would have fired or WRITTEN UP younger cooks for ignoring ALLERGIES.

Second: Delivery was almost 15 minutes late... Which would be fine on Friday, at 9pm, was the product good. But allow me to re-iterate, this was the lowest quality take-out I have ever received... And delivery time was specified as 50 minutes. I don't drive, but this place is local. Google maps indiciates it is 1.1km away from my house.

Clearly their fryer was too cold, or overcrowded. ALL of the food was so greasy, AND undercooked. I have included a picture of the inside of the fried chicken wings... RAW flour/breading is clearly visible. I have Included a picture of their egg-rolls. CLEARLY the fryer basket wasn't moved, or shaken... As there is VERY prominant spots on our eggrolls where they were touching, and therefore became underfried. The chicken wings were thrown out under fears of salmonella. Vegetables were so old (Yellow Brocoli anyone?) That I don't trust chicken wings to be fresh... And doubled with undercooked flour... I'm wary. 

ALL of the food was very low on flavor... And Salt? Seasoning is important in any food... And Chinese takeout is typically over-seasoned. Fried rice from Westtown tasted like... Nothing at all. I can fix that... But Alas, there's no point as the dish contained egg. 

I have ordered from here before. And I don't mind waiting for good food... But this... This will be the last time I ever order from westtown again. I've had better food at AYCE lunch buffets in the 7-9$ price range... 

I can't recommend you stay away more. If Westtown wishes to contact me, they may do so, for the Menulava order  Placed on 2017-04-07 20:40:10 for delivery to M5A2R3. I stand behind this review. I am appalled."}
{"text":"Their delivery driver ran through the front desk curtain and attempted to photograph our patrons (at an upscale sex club)- the manager on duty had to jump in and physically stop the driver.

The restaurant was completely unapologetic and refuse to handle the situation. We will never be giving business to this establishment again- jeopardizing the privacy of your clientele is absolutely unforgivable and quite frankly, repulsive."}
{"text":"Nothing but greasy, old-school Chinese at Westown Chinese Food. Their food reminds me of food-court Chinese... Chop suey, deep fried chicken balls, even fortune cookies for dessert! Everything is dirt cheap, too. You can taste the MSG, and it's not the best Chinese delivery I've ever had (cue Asian Legend and Lai Wah Heen) but it was OK.

Ordered delivery, and it arrived in about 45 minutes."}
