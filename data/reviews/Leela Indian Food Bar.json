{"text":"Great service! Very friendly! Eggplant fries soooo good! Okra curry a bit light on the okra but lotsa other veggies in it and delicious flavour, as were all the dishes we got! Simply scrumptious!  Chili garlic naan is another must-have! So much good garlicness! Lamb in roganjosh was a bit tough/chewy when we had it but the flavouring pretry much makes up for it.  

We got there before the dinner rush and they gave us each a freebie shot size of a refreshing drink,  can't remember exactly what was in it (cucumber, ginger, something that made it bright red but in a natural way).

Can't wait to go back and bring alll my friends!"}
{"text":"Always makes you wonder, writing a good review after the only other one was poor. Anyway, my Family and I were walking home and I could smell the curry on the street. Inspired, we later ordered food for pick up and it was delicious. Hands down, the best Vindaloo I have had since being in Canada for 7 years. Flavour, heat, spice were perfect. My wife had the Paneer Lasagne which she loved. We also had a curry dip. Really good. They are new so maybe give the reviews time, unlike me. However, what I had was great."}
{"text":"We had the dinner for 2, and it was plenty  for the 3 of us.    We also ordered the  samosas and they were the best we  ever have had.    Definately this will be our go-to place in the Junction.   The food was ready in 1/2 hour.   Great Service and Food!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with my girlfriends. Excellent service and delicious food! Every dish we ordered was flavourful and cooked perfectly. Beautiful space to dine in. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We're pretty picky about Indian food and went to Leela the other night with friends and loved it. The food was wonderful, especially the roasted cauliflower chaat the waiter recommended, the lamb curry and the fish dish.  We ordered a lot of things (maybe 8 dishes) and they were all amazing. The only dish I wouldn't order next time is the okra one, as it was some sort of veggie stew, with two pieces of okra in it. And the service was superb. In fact we asked about the okra dish after the meal (as we thought maybe we'd ordered the wrong thing) and the waiter took it off our bill, which was totally unnecessary, but nice. We live in the neighbourhood so will definitely be regulars."}
{"text":"The portions are very generous and the staff are super friendly. I would say the food is certainly above average, judging against Indian food I've had in the past."}
{"text":"Dropped in for an early dinner, we were the only ones here. Chilli garlic naan was 10/10, the butter chicken was served with 2 smoking coals which gave it an awesome smell when out on the table, it tasted so good as well. Vegetable biryani had very good flavours and and had good heat to it. The samosas were dope, the sauces were drizzled on top but I wish the sauces were on the side because they were so good. I would come here all the time to try everything on the menu. This place is a freakng gem"}
{"text":"Very impressed for this new option in the Junction. Went last night and the Service was very attentive and atmosphere was nice. Food: while ordering the waiter mentioned the cauliflower app the next time we come. Even though we had an app that made me want to try that too figuring a doggy bag would be fine for lunch the next day. 

The cauliflower app tasted like chicken wings but with no chicken, it was like healthy chicken wings. WOW!

The char grilled shrimp, is the best shrimp dish I have had in at least 5-10 years. 

Those were my two highlights. Everything else was amazing."}
{"text":"PROS:
Channa Masala was good
Delivery came faster than expected 
Friendly service 
Delivery was free over $40 before tax
Portions were generous 

CONS:

The Aloo Gobi tasted ok, however I did find that it was oily. I would suggest using less oil so that you can taste the masala flavour more. 

I ordered the Vegetable Biryani and didn't like it that much. It tasted and smelled too much like overbrowned butter. I liked the seasoning in it, but the overbrowned butter was overpowering the flavours in the biryani. I've had biryani at other Indian places and it's never tasted like this one. Usually there is supposed to be some butter taste, but not too much. I should of gone for plain rice instead or the pulao. 

Overall, it was ok. I am sure some items taste better than others, just like most restaurants. I wouldn't deter someone from ordering from here. For me, I like things with less oil and more flavour."}
{"text":"Upscale Indian restaurant in the Junction.  
Ordered the eggplant fries, lasooni cauliflower, and butter chicken.  Food, and service were great.  Why 4 stars?  $3.50 for naan.  I can justify the pricey-ness of everything else with quality, creativity, or taste, I cannot justify paying more for a smaller portion of naan."}
{"text":"Wow.  This food is really amazing!   The tandoori chicken tikka is very flavourful!  And the tandoori prawns are even better!!! Excellent, courteous, timely delivery service.  I can't think of an Indian restaurant that's better than this one.  Come to think of it, there aren't many restaurants of any kind that serve food as tasty as this one.  And the prices are quite reasonable.  Thanks for listening to my request and making my dishes super spicy!!!  I'll order again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Whoa! Authentic taste. Best date night ever. The foods are yummy. Interior is tasteful and music is just right. Best date night ever!"}
{"text":"The spinach & kale pakoras are simply fabulous! tasty, definitely healthy and beautifully presented. Not greasy or over-spiced. You could eat them as a main course, too. Yummmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Great service, really fun street food, and awesome and unique cocktails! They were awesome in accommodating our dietary restrictions too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Restaurant and absolutely great service by Hormas! Very tasty food and loved the decor."}
{"text":"Amazing just amazing food was so good and the service matched the quality of food as well 
The smoked butter chicken took us by surprise and their roasted cauliflower dish was phenomenal 
Would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Some dishes are ok others are a joke. Ordered for delivery got the grilled okra, oxtail and shrimp. The shrimp curry has beautiful quality shrimp but only came with 4 shrimp. The oxtail was ok and had a flavorful sauce, not great. The grilled okra was a joke. there was a thick soupy sauce with two small pieces of cauliflower in it and potatoes!!!! There was a tiny piece of okra twice the size of a pea in it which is the only reason I knew it was the okra dish. Lmao
The vegetable pakora was also awful just a pattie that tasted like chalk. Will definitely not be going back. Curry twist is way better if you are in the junction and Tich is the best if you are in the west end. I would definitely skip this place!"}
{"text":"Being used to indian food in Brampton, I've never found anything more than average in the west end of Toronto, but that's now changed. We had the 15 item tasting menu and it was all delicious. The servers were awesome and attentive. Thoroughly impressed. We'll be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Delivery just below $50 after fees and tip off JustEat
+ naan has no burned parts. No cancer there
+ ordered rice side come in medium box, more than average restaurants
+ chicken and spinach dish comes with lots of chicken and dish is not as oil or greasy as other similar Indian places
+ butter chicken has more chicken than other
- no utensils or napkins. If you order via an app, ask for those.
- naan bread order is nearly $4 but lesser portion than many places, including Touched, basement of Dinamic Tower across from Staples in the PATH, which dishes combo including same portion naan full size total around $10

See photos for what look like"}
{"text":"I usually don't write bad reviews but worst experience from this restaurant twice. 
First they delivered incomplete order and now on Valentine's day after waiting for 2.5 hours they say they never received any order and they don't even have records of any order.  
The taste is good so please go ahead and have it but bad delivery management.

*editing this review as the restaurant has assured they have fixed their systems to resolve the ordering issue. Keep up the good taste and good service."}
{"text":"Indian food in the Junction! So tasty.

Best app that seems everyone gets! Lasooni cauliflower and it's delicious! Very spicy so not for the faint of heart.

Eggplant fries, also very good. Looks just like a French fry.

For main, tried the lime fish. Fish itself was delicious, but I was expecting something slightly different.

The staff was very nice, took care of us. Only thing is (and I hope they've resolved this now) they did not have a high chair."}
{"text":"I recently went here as a group of 4 and we each had their 12 course tasting menu plus wine pairing and it was a very nice experience. The restaurant was clean, staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was flavourful and prepared well. I'd have preferred the dishes to be more spicy, but didn't ask so that's on me.  For anyone going I'd recommend getting their cauliflower appetizer, it is delicious. 

Overall Leela is a nice addition to the junction and I will be back."}
{"text":"Great place to to have a sit down meal or takeout. There are other Indian restaurants nearby but go and try this one . Friendly staff, nice setting, nice size portions. We were able to book a reservation tonight at 5:30/6:00pm for a 7:30pm (6 people). Thank you Leela 's. The six of us had a great shared meal with ( lucky me) leftovers. We started out with the Truffle Ghee Kulcha and Lasooni Cauliflower  and Vegetable Samosas. We loved them. The Lasooni Cauliflower was nice and spicy. Then we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, 2 Oxtails Vindaloo(spicy ),2 orders of Kashmiri Lamb Roganjosh, Kale & Spinach Curry, Dal Makhani and 2 orders of naan bread. We're done and happy. Thank you all at Leela's. So to all of you don't read this review and let me be able to continue making last minute reservations."}
{"text":"Would give it more stars if I could.
VERY unusually they have Pork on the menu (and Oxtail). Ordered the pork and it was out of this world. Large tender flavourful pieces with a nice buzz. The coastal Prawn curry was also good as was the naan. Delivery was prompt and food was warm. Only mild criticism is that they do not have any form of a Buriyani or Pulau with meat. Almost as good as the best but a lot more affordable."}
{"text":"Although the butter chicken is good it's way over priced. $14.95 + tax for 5 small pieces of chicken. Doesn't even come with rice."}
{"text":"If you are looking to get robbed under the guise of \"fusion\" or experimental indian food then by all means go here. They charge $16-17 for oxtail and give you one piece of oxtail in a ton of gravy. One would mistaken to think that oxtail is as pricey as wagyu judging by this place. Then the shrimp malai curry which has a lot of malai but sorely missing the shrimp. Whoever had shrimp curry with 4 pieces of small shrimp in it? Decrease your greed and increase your portion."}
{"text":"A very cozy, cute restaurant. Very clean and wonderful service. The food was also spectacular along with their drinks. All I have to give them are compliments!"}
{"text":"I ordered food at this place via Just eat. They called me shortly after I made my order and told me it was going to be able 1hr 45 - 2 hrs for my food to come. I misheard and thought he said 45 mins to 2 hours. After about an hour and a half I called again to get the status of the order. He said it was ready and he would personally uber it to me so I wouldn't have to wait any longer. I appreciated him accommodating as I'm sure he understand when you're ordering in you're already hungry hahaha. I was annoyed with the wait but the food was so worth it. Probably the best I've had in the city. Will definitely be eating here again but maybe in shop rather than ordering."}
{"text":"I'm a local business owner and decided to check out my neighbours. I was craving Indian food and decided to come here. Glad I did, food was really good, service was great and loved how cozy this little place was. I ordered the butter chicken, was very tasty and the butter naan ( wasn't burnt or dried out) so yum!
Having been to the other Indian places just down the road, this place was my favourite. I never judge a book by its cover. ... another awesome place for my cravings.
The only reason I rated it four stars is because I was alone and was wanting to try everything on their menu... I'll save that for my next visit"}
{"text":"I recognized the Amaya name from their food court locations but was curious to try to this sit down version in my 'hood since decent Indian in the West end is hard to come by.

We arrived around 6:30pm-ish on a Friday night and were seated immediately.  Restaurant was pretty empty but filled up quickly within a half hour.

We ordered the cauliflower chaat ($7.95), two chicken dishes - butter and one other ($12.95 each), side of rice ($3.75), garlic naan ($3.25), raita ($2.95) and two glasses of pinot grigio ($8.95).  

Our cauliflower came out first and it was simply delish...I could have eaten just that as my main!  Our chicken dishes came next and I was impressed that there was a smouldering piece of charcoal in my butter chicken which the waiter told us was for flavour and quickly removed it.  Even though the chicken dishes were not indicated as spicy on the menu, I still detected a bit of heat, which we cooled down with the cucumber raita.  Main portions were big enough to split between two people if you want to load up on appetizers.  The garlic nana was super fresh, very light and flavourful. 

Service was attentive and they answered all our questions.  Definitely a welcome addition to the Junction 'hood.  I'm dreaming of the cauliflower and will be back!  I hope Leela is here to stay."}
{"text":"Just wanna say this was a phenomenal birthday experience. Our server did an outstanding job and was really attentive. The food was also on point! Loved the display and flavours of the dishes we got. We will be back soon to celebrate more birthdays! 
Also must try would have to be their dessert. I would say it's their version of a soaked Tim bit dessert  that is honestly one of a kind and truly special! Loved everything about this place. If you're in the area don't hesitate!!!"}
{"text":"This place is rubbish. I was shocked when the chicken tikka arrived - it was three small cubes of chicken for $13.95. The portion was not even the equivalent of half a chicken breast and was completely tasteless, dry and bland. The samosas arrived with no dipping sauce/chutney and the naan bread was very average. Probably the worst Indian food I have ever had. The prices are ridiculous for what you get. Never again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time. Really enjoyed the tasting menu.  Butter chicken, saag paneer and tika masala were excellent. I'll will return b"}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING. I have been to many Indian restaurants, but this one is a top notch flavor. Also service was awoesome. Their special 12 meal course is worth every dollar. The ambiance is really cool and the mango laci is fantastic."}
{"text":"I am torn between wanting to rave about this restaurant and wanting to keep it all to myself. 
Eat here. It is excellent. The food is superlative. If you dine in, the place is just lovely. The service is excellent. The chances of getting a table are good. But the food. Oh the food. 
I have been eating Indian food in this city for a long time. And find that there is a big range between \"same old same old\" and the experimental kind that leaves you wishing for butter chicken. Leela hits a sweet spot. The dishes are familiar yet the execution is not what you are necessarily expecting. This is Indian food that tastes like it is made by someone who has studied the flavours of Indian food. 
Eat here. Eat everything here. But most of all eat the samosas, paneer tikka, shrimp malai curry, and Dahl makhani. The chef's tasting menu is $40 and gives you 12 dishes. I recommend doing this and letting the just surprise you. 
So there. I blame myself if I cannot get a table next time I make it out to Leela."}
{"text":"Unfortunately disappointing. We ordered the butter chicken. The sauce was great but I took one bite of the chicken and could tell right away that it wasn't real chicken. Or maybe it was chicken mixed with TVP (textured vegetable protein). Believe me I can tell the difference between 100% real chicken and something that's not even close. We got take out so I wasn't able to ask the server (but how would I even ask that?! Who is your \"chicken\" supplier??) Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Service terrific..food fresh and fun but taco's did not work for me...awkward.
Cauliflower chaat yum,prawn curry tasty,chicken tikka a winner,paneer tasty.
Overall great experience..would definitely return!"}
{"text":"A real gem on Dundas. We went for the tasting and every bite was delicious. The server was always with a smile and offering us complimentary rice and sauce. We will definitely go again for the food and the service!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing spectacular. It was clear we were vegetarians (asked about vegetarian tasting menu and only ordered vegetarian dishes) but the sauce with the Kashmiri naan had lamb, which we were not told about. When we questioned the server he went to check and confirmed it did indeed have meat. Although he apologized, he did not take the dish off the bill.

The \"truffle ghee naan\" tasted like regular plain naan.

Would not go back."}
