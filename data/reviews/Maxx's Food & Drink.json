{"text":"This place is a fun little bar. Went there after work with some girlfriends for a girls night out and it had a nice relaxed atmosphere. We felt safe drinking and hanging out and weren't bothered. The two bartenders were fun and accommodating. Will go back soon."}
{"text":"The best bar in Boulder City! Great pours, awesome bartenders and the juke box is always at the right volume for a good party!"}
{"text":"This is a little bar attached to a motel on the main drag.  We stopped in for a cold drink after walking the downtown area.  At first, some of the regulars seemed to be off-putting, but we came back a second time and the crowd was a younger group.  They have a food menu but we had already eaten both times we came by.  They have TV's with the weekend golf tournament playing.  They also have touch tunes for music choices.  The bartending staff was very friendly and helpful.  They recommended a new beer that we tried and enjoyed.  We did not come at night, but had a good time in the afternoon.  It was close enough to where we were staying to walk home if we had to much fun also."}
