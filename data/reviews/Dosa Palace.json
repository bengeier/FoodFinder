{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here so often! We love this place, definitely try their biryani chicken, mutton rolls and kuttu roti!"}
{"text":"\"Were there this past week and had a disappointing experience. The dosa we ordered included a cheese dosa and there was no cheese.... the daal was cold ..... I would not go here again after this experience.\""}
{"text":"This place was great! True indian food!
Food was terrific and so spicy, just like in India!
We had the Vada with chutney, which was delicious. The fish and rice combo was enormous! we then had the mango lassi to counter the spiciness. All was delish.
We didn't have dinner that day - we were so full!
great value for your money. I'm usually not in the area, but when I'll go there again, I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  We love the Dosa here.  The Dosa always comes out crispy and delicious.  The chutney of tomato and onion is soooo delicious.  The mutton (lamb) curry platter is also delicious - we especially loved the okra side dish and the extremely flavorful dal.  Everything was very flavorful and delicious.  Best part is that price is excellent. We go on Tuesdays for the $1 off of dosas and the huge dosa comes out to around $7.  Other platters are around the same price."}
{"text":"Uff...love the dosas here. The food quantity is great and meal is delicious. A must try for dosa lovers!"}
{"text":"It's a rainy, cold night here in Mississauga. We just moved from central Toronto,west, to Old Port Credit area. We wanted curry. I grabbed my iPad and Yelped for help and up came this place. We got into the car,hungry after having spent the day digging out overgrown shrubs and tearing apart our basement.

We drove past it. Did a circle around and came back to Dundas and there it was. We pulled in. It's a wee hole in the wall place. Take out and eat in; are 8 tables in total, 6 of which seat 8.

 I wanted a Dosa. Only once had I ever sampled one. My fianc√© decided to try one too. We made our choices and sat down to wait. Then out they came. And oh my were they good. I am still basking in their goodness. 

This restaurant has a good menu, is not over-priced and has friendly and helpful staff.

We are going back!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with this place :-(
The other reviews that gave more than 2.5 stars seems to be fabricated.
We visited around 7pm on Fri, Had mutton tray with 4 veggies - the food was very salty and .... cold. All food items were soggy, the meat was hard - we could hardly chew it.
There was a shady guy that looked like homeless asking staff to sample different food items - they were sampling him with the same spoon from all the food trays! - I wish I saw that before ordering my food!"}
{"text":"It's not the cleanest place, but it kinda adds to the character of the place. Looks like you are actually in India. I have tried the Beriyani many times and it sures worth what you pay for."}
{"text":"Love this place!  They make the best dosa's at a reasonable price.
Service is super friendly and timely.
Always get the Masala dosa, it's the size of my arm!  Comes with 3 tasty sauces and a spicy soup which is addictive all for under $7
The inside decor is dated but I'm here for the food!!"}
{"text":"The food was really old. I got a plate that content 1 meat and 3 vegetables. 
I took 2 different types of eggplant which has no taste at all. Also a mix vegetables which was the wired thing ever the potato was so dry and hard like a rock.  The Queen of the plate was chicken and the meat was dry and the color turn black.  I thought it is beef but it was not.  It was to go order. Not recommended"}
{"text":"Quick Review-I have been there few times, I had tried their Veggie Thali, and mutton Biriyani, The Thali was great, but I would not recommend the Biriyani.
I read somewhere in the reviews, that one person had ordered their Biriyani more than once. Wow! Quick description: Basmati rice drenched in turmeric, cloves and I think cinnamon ( it tasted bizarre ) with thinly sliced stir fry meat, sorry to say that is not any kind of Biriyani, and yes I had South Indian and Sri lankan Biriyani before, and it does not taste or look like what they have over there.

Overall 
The service was good
Stay away from the Biriyani.
I probably would go back and try their Dosas"}
{"text":"Delicious and filling. We were thrown off by the small place at first, but it is genuinely delicious and authentic and inexpensive. I had the paper dosa and filter coffee, both were excellent. Good experience and will return soon."}
{"text":"Dosa palace can be found in a strip mall, north-east corner of Hurontario and Dundas St. Its ~10 min from the 403 exit. Dosa Palace is a very unassuming place beside an assuming collection of local eateries. They do take out or eat in. 

The place itself is nothing to call home about. Its a typical indian dining style; old style cloth covered chairs, plastic tablecloths :). But it is clean and there is a bathroom.

I went with the masala dosa, my friend the chicken masala dosa, and an order of kothu rotti (mmm....carbalicious kothu rotti). I really enjoyed my dosa-it was served as a giant, thin, crispy roll, which you break off parts to eat with the potato filling. Our dosas were $7 each, very reasonable.

I like this place for the traditional south indian food it serves. Also on the menu was selection of biryani, and a few dishes I have never heard of. 

Their chai was also excellent. I'll be back for more dosa. I also appreciated that on both visits this place wasnt too busy, service was timely. You don't have to worry about making reservations"}
{"text":"The Dolsa was HUGE and good, but the best part was the Masala Chai! It's in such a small cup but its so flavorful."}
{"text":"Just want to update my review to let you know about their specials.

{"text":"I came to Dosa Palace on the advice of yelpers, but I wasn't blown away like others with the Masala Dosa offering. Though Dosa Palace is not bad, there are about 50 of these types of restaurants in Scarborough. Maybe Mississauga just needs more options where Sri Lankan food is concerned. 

The dosa itself was well made, crispy and just slightly greasy like I like 'em. The rasam was lukewarm, not hot and the chutney and masala was extremely, unbearably spicy. 

The restaurant itself is in a seedy part of Mississauga and service is a little off through staff is generally pleasant; you might have to repeat requests once or twice."}
{"text":"The food here is no joke. Like possibly the best biryani I have ever had. It sets your mouth on fire though, watch out. The dosa is, of course, supercalifragilistiliious. 

It's a tiny restaurant, with really amazing prices for the amount of food you are served. I think they do more take out than dine in, but their dine in service is good for a place with no dedicated servers. They're also open pretty late, which is nice in the suburbs.

The restaurant is sort of cafeteria styled, with the curries sitting out in front of you to look at (and drool over) before you decide which ones you want. It's very veg friendly too. It's situated in a sketchy little plaza but don't let that turn you off! Come eat the greatest, fluffiest, longest and best dosa of your life."}
{"text":"Delicious x 25, both meat and vegetarian friendly. HOT. Great value. 

This was an awesome find, a combination of South Indian and Srilankan food.. The exterior is completely overlookable, as the unassuming storefront in a rundown strip mall is dwarfed by its neighboring BURRITO BOYZ with its gaudy and \"hip\" awning. Once inside Dosa Corner, your nose is already telling you this is the mother-load.

Convinced my dad to join me here, and we ordered a plate of chicken curry and the vegetable biriyani. Both were stellar. The chicken curry is made in a fiery red gravy reinforced with fennel (a black licorice essence) and some kind of red-black-marbled peppercorn. Delectable! It's served up with a pile of basmati, and four small sides (ours included curried eggplant, spiced potato cubes, a yellow lentil dal, and a lemony sweet-sour vegetable that I couldn't identify, regrettably. All the sides were terrific.

The vegetable biriyani was a really strange call for me as I've disliked the dish at two other restaurants in the past, but, as though speaking in tongues, the order just belched out of my mouth, and it could only be fate that resulted in another mouth-watering success. This fried rice dish was impeccable. Packed with veggies, subtle spices, and a great amount of body-warming peppery heat... the mouth was stinging gently and the nasal cavities were losing all control. Loved it.

The only catch to this unconditionally super meal (and at a very reasonable price) was that they were exploding with business (80% of it take out orders) and there was only ONE person manning the register, the phone, serving the food in to-go bags, bringing food to the tables, and cleaning the tables. The impossible was being asked of this one person, yet she kept things going as best she could. The result was chaos in front of the register, the ability to maintain a single-file line had long since broken down, people were swarming the counter with requests, demands, complaints (about the speed of service), and unneeded jokes, and it took me almost 20 minutes of standing after the meal to pay. They need to fix this (ie. hire another front worker), still, I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I came here with a Sri Lankan friend who wanted to pick up some takeout.  Her family swears by this place - not sure if it's 'cause it's authentic &/or cheap.

Anyway, prices are very reasonable:  chicken biryani (Sri Lankan style, not the same as Hyderabadi/Pakistani) was $6.50 and vadas were $0.50/ea.

The reason for the minus * was the wait-time.  I was sorta in a rush to go somewhere and I thought that it would take 5mins for my takeout.  HOWEVER, I felt like it was at least a 15-20min wait which is fine, but I would've liked some notice, re:  \"Oh, we're preparing the biryani from scratch, so the wait will be at least _____________\".

Comparing this chicken biryani to other Pakistani places, this one is more saucy/wet, spicier, and the rice is larger grain than thinner basmati.  So I found this one more heavier.  It was good, but I prefer the slightly lighter tasting kind.

Vadas were alright, tasted like they were fried in fish oil.  I probably wouldn't get them again 'cause it tasted like a heavier, savoury doughnut with a hint of fish."}
{"text":"Menu was poor and when I tried to order they ran out of many of the dishes...it was prime dinner time too so found it odd that they ran out of food. Was not impressed."}
{"text":"We ordered masala dosas and took them almost 40 minutes to bring it to the table. Place wasn't even busy. Extremely slow service. Food tasted below average. Definitely one of the worst tasting masala dosas. Won't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a Sri Lankan restaurant, which offer a variety of unique dishes. However, I wasn't a huge fan of this place and don't think I would return. 
The ambiance of this restaurant is dull and lacks any effort. There lacked any service, whereby I had to go up and ask them for a menu, which actually was just a flyer with around 7-10 options. Also the staff didn't know english very well, which resulted in them misunderstanding my order the first time. Finally, the food was bland and resulted in me having to use the salt shaker several times on everything.
My brother and dad got the puttu (bland) and I got the dosa (extremely bland). 
I would not go here again."}
{"text":"Simple and straightforward, fun, but disappointing.   Watch out for small pieces of bone in the chicken kothu roti."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed at all
Good was cold. Should've been hot
Didn't like their dosa platter
Pricing was good
Ambience was just bleh"}
