{"text":"I just went through the drive they and got the steak platter with eggs rice and beans.   Within 10 minutes my stomach is upset and I got diarrhea. I called them and they tell me it's all fresh and it must be my system. I only ate some steak egg and beans!  He says he cannot help me to talk to his manager Victor tomorrow or the next day. BAD food. BAD service. They didn't offer me a receipt either so I can even prove it.  Give them less than 0 stars."}
{"text":"I was having taco cravings so I thought I'd give this local neighborhood business a try. Seems nice and clean inside and friendly service. I chose basic tacos...one beef and one chicken. I just had lettuce, no cheese or any salsa or anything. They were very unimpressive. The meat of both tacos was tender, but completely flavorless, like there was zero seasoning on it. Sad to say, I will keep looking for a place close to home to get my taco fix."}
{"text":"This place is garbage! Refried beans from a can? Microwaved rice? And those prices are a joke. I went for convenience because it was near. Never again."}
{"text":"Drove past the place a lot the past few weeks, always calling my name. Today I finally caved and tried it. The drive thru lady recommended the carne Asada burro - and I was glad she did. The pico de gallo was so fresh and amazing, and the guac was delicious. The meat was good too. Definitely not the best burrito I've ever had, but I'll def go there again next time I'm in the hood."}
{"text":"This place is always good and makes really good burritos the huevos rancheros burrito is super yummy we come here at like five times a week and it is always delicious"}
{"text":"I drove all the way from Laveen because I was craving the shrimp burritos from another Armando's restaurant on 44th and Thomas (which I found out is now closed).  Anyways, the food at this restaurant was nasty.  The shrimp burro had a nasty metallic taste and the red sauce in it had this weird pasty sauce and foul tasting vegetables; I think it was cabbage or something like that.  The bean burro was tasteless and seem dried up.  The red sauce tasted bitter; totally not edible.  Additionally, they took forever to give us the food.  Will never return."}
{"text":"After running six miles rather than the intended 4 miles this evening, I decided to end my run in front of Armando's. I felt as though I deserved a few street tacos. I had three small soft chicken tacos with lots of fresh pico de gallo. Yummmm! This hit the spot. Clean and friendly. Good thing I was only a few miles away from home.  I should have ordered more to go and ran with tacos in a bag. Ha! Give 'em a try. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Go to spot when in need of a quick fix!!! Nothing special but solid! A solid 3.5.  Ask for the bag of carrots and jalape√±o!!!! They know what they're doing."}
{"text":"This place recently opened, it didn't take long for them to open their doors after Poblano shut their doors. Have been here a few times, and really enjoyed this place. My favorite is their Mexican Steak Burger, it's your usual burger except has added chipotle sauce, pepper jack cheese. I have had their sonoran dog, first time I ever had one and really enjoyed it. Glad they open this place up,"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are such bad reviews for this place. It's a drive through Mexican fast food place after all. For what it is, it is way better than all the \"Omni-betos\" out there. The food has been fresh every time I've been there. I'm not one to write a terrible review of some place after only being there once but apparently other people are. I would recommend the Sonoran hot dogs. The buns are fresh and they even put real avocado slices on it."}
