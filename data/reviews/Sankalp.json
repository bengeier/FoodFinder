{"text":"Visited on a sunday evening. Restaurant wasn't busy. Food was decent. Ambiance does not match with a south indian restaurant. Servers should probably get a uniform. Causal wear for the servers looks very unprofessional. It is hard to know if the person coming towards you is your  server or another customer.  The service was good though. Servers were patient and courteous. Food came out on time and was good.   Will visit again. Would be happy if they work on the ambiance and the uniforms for the servers though."}
{"text":"We had curries, dosa and chicken wings .. Everything was delicious.. also had sizzling brownie at the end which was amazing too..."}
{"text":"We went to Sankalp this evening and would rate this as our worst experience ever. The taste of the food was decent, but the overall service was terrible.  We waited to get get seated for more than 40 minutes and then after getting seated, the food did not arrive for another 45 minutes. When we complained about the food not coming on time, it literaly came out in next 2,minutes. We had ordered ddosas, daal roti and birayni. Dosas and daal roti came but biryaani never came. Rest of the food was finished. Plates taken back and then there came the biryaani after. My dad found a piece of BIG PLASTIC in the sambar ( I am uploading a photo of that).  Then on complaining, the owner of the restaurant (a lady) came out and said \"these things happen and have also happened to them at tandoori flames\" and started justifying her.  She however did apologize, but was very arrogant and rude and just walked away from the conversation..we did get hyper at that time though.  Her husband came out after and was very polite about the situation and apologized. Also the one major thing the lady said was \" what else do you want me to do, give my life away\". Which as a business owner is not acceptable.  We were gonna call the CFI, but my dad asked us not to.  We have been to many many restaurants before, bit this one was a real pain.  Definitely never going in again, just because ofbservice and the attitude of the workers."}
{"text":"finally a sambhar that actually tastes good with all of the right amount of spices and salt. Umpa was also good and so were all the dosas."}
{"text":"Very pathetic service and food. Stopped serving North Indian and non veg. Don't even carry rice. Only dosas, idly and Vada.. Manager was drinking liquor and was not serving to guest.."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for a nice Indian restaurant. Had the onion dosa and it was nice and crispy but the Masala filling doesn't scream delicious Indian food.   Ambience is casual and looks a bit like the inside of a Canadian family style eatery."}
