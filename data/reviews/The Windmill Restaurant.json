{"text":"When it comes to middle eastern food in downtown Toronto, there is little to no choice other than the generic shawarma strategically placed on every busy corner. Lookout! There is a new Arab in town and I will never eat generic again!!   Windmill caters to all middle eastern masses that despise the trek to Warden street for anything resembling Arab. It boasts an extensive menu starting from zaatar and arrayes to authentic clay pots steaming with yummy stews with a 'hat' of rich soft pastry baked right on. A first time menu item in this city and fairly mindblowing I must say. In between, you will also find some Mediterranean pizzas and moussaka as well as pastry pies and burgers. All tables are served with a warm basket of fresh baked bread and olive oil done arab style. The odd menu item is scratched out with pen or written over with a sharpie. OK so they are trying to find their niche..arent we all?.   The location can be kind of strange on the corner of Bay and St. Joseph and I cant say I'm a big fan of the faux terracotta flooring and blinds-to-go window coverings however the summer patio has served me well. There is a regular turnover of servers ranging from the owner's daughter to the 2009 freshman at U of T but each has been pleasant and knowledgeable and far from an eye sore. That helps right?   Windmill is a 5 star in my books. Now if only Mr. Owner will let me redecorate..."}
{"text":"Alas, I just went by here the other day and it seems that they couldn't make their rent payments and had to shut down :( It's too bad that another good place couldn't make it, but the location wasn't great and the restaurant business is very tough at the best of times.   Here's hoping that they reopen, or that the owner takes his recipes somewhere with better foot traffic."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place like this for a while. I find there are very few Mediterranean options in the area.   I had the Chicken Raisin and Almond Pie (pretty sure that's what it was called), don't be fooled by the 'pie', it is more of a turnover. It was delicious!! They had a bucnh of other tasty options, and I was only there for lunch so they might have more on a dinner menu??  Service was awesome as well. As an added touch, when you order the stew(s) you and you're table gets a nice interactive experience (I won't ruin the surprise you'll have to see for yourself)."}
