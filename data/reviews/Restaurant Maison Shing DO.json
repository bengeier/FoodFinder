{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place i got general tso tofu, vegetable fried rice and vegetable shaungai noodles. The general tso tofu was good but just a little to oily and the container that it came in was big but there was not alot of tofu in it, the vegetable fried rice was ok and shaungai noodles was really good it was mixed with tofu and onions and soya sauce. Delivery took around 40 min not bad i live around 20 min from the restaurant they told me before it will take that long."}
{"text":"Had delivery  a couple weeks ago, good food warm and fresh, however terrible delivery service takes over an hour for a couple items located no more than 15 minutes away."}
{"text":"We ordered through the online service Just Eat. The order was for a combination dinner of won ton soup, orange beef, spicy peanut butter chicken, big shrimp with vegetables and spring rolls.  The order showed up exactly at the promised time.  Unfortunately, all of the food was luke warm and had to be reheated in the microwave.  The won ton soup had a plain broth - not very tasteful but the won tons themselves were good.  The spring rolls were excellent and were highlights of the meal.  The orange beef lacked any crispness even before being reheated and was in a dark brown sweet sauce that lacked any orange flavor.  The chicken fried rice was very dry and needed sauce from one or more of the other dishes to be edible.  the big shrimp and vegetables was very good. Decent sized shrimp and stir fried vegetables that were fresh and were flavorful.  The chicken in spicy peanut butter sauce was the mystery dish or the night. I think it was another dish altogether. The thinly sliced chicken was tender but the sauce was orange colored and greasy and there was nothing resembling peanut butter or spice (see photo).  There are many Asian restaurants on that particular drop of Decarie Boulevard. I would suggest trying any one of the others."}
{"text":"Sadly 1 star is the lowest i can give. I wish i could give in the negative. Anyway service is awful. They barely speak the language and take more than 1 and half hour to deliver. The food was cold and they still wanted us to pay full price for cold food. Psd: the deliver was 8 minutes from the restaurant."}
{"text":"We used to go there to order chinese food because it was the best and only option compared to the other chinese restaurants in the neighborhood. Although I am never going back, last time we only asked to the cashiere how long would it take for an order to be ready for a take out and she went to ask I'm guessing the manager... He came back literally yelling at us, telling us that it depends on the plates we order etc... He was so aggressive for no good reason, we ended up leaving really disappointed and promising ourselves not to go back."}
{"text":"after seeing the rating I was worried as we had already committed and we're sitting down. but I figured if your a local they have special menus.  the soup was soso  as the owners were Chinese and this was Vietnamese.  but everything else was very good. meat balls were a nice surprise. spice chicken was excellent but not what we ordered. shredded pork excellent and super spicey. dumpling were passable. and my fave was the home made chilly oil made just for me."}
