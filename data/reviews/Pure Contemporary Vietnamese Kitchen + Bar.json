{"text":"Found these guys at taste of calgary and had to go to the restaurant after tasting their char siu sesame doughnut it was so delicious. Aside from the doughnut i ordered a char siu viet sub it was light and airy it wasn't my favourite but it didn't taste bad at all! I might just order pho next time."}
{"text":"Ordered the donut, clay pot chicken mushroom and peas, tossed noodles, duck spring rolls and the wings. 

Dishes were on the saucier side and ambiance is an old night club but  everything was tasty! 

No pho during dinner service ):"}
{"text":"This is even better than Chef Lam Pham's previous venture. The food is absolutely delicious and is better represented than it was in the fast food format at Watercress. Char Siu donut amazing, wings with nuoc cham are killer crispy and delicious.  Green Papaya salad was fragrant, spicy, served with sweet charred shrimp and crunchy peanuts is really amazing. Soups are huge and made from real stock no bases here. Great for lunch and I'd imagine their after work business at half price appetizers would be hugely successful and well deserved. Apparently the room converts on weekend evenings to a cocktail lounge/dance bar which would probably serve some of the most delicious Vietnamese food I've ever eaten. A really talented chef. We will be back again and again for sure.....!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was terrific. Very fresh flavours and the pho was the best I have had as the broth was very flavourful. Also, try the \"donut\" as it is excellent - big flavours. Clean and modern with excellent service."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe how excited I was to FINALLY try Pure! 

We lucked out that they were open on the stat holiday and it was quiet so not only did our food come out quickly, we were able to enjoy our time dining on the patio.

Pure puts a modern twist on traditional Vietnamese dishes that makes their food unique and memorable. Case in point? Their char siu sesame donut which is a take on a viet sub but on a delish deep fried \"bun\". And ban xeo but in taco form? Genius!

Not only is their food fresh and flavorful, it's fun! 

I will absolutely be back, that crispy pork belly dish on their dinner menu is calling my name!"}
{"text":"still love the dishes this place offers and I have tried many of their dishes. They are a little bit pricing but great taste."}
{"text":"Wow.

I am a big fan of Pure. Calgary has been lacking big time for modern Vietnamese cuisine, and now it has arrived!

We almost ate the whole menu in one go. The items are all great to share and great portions where you leave feeling good. Their Char Sui Sesame Donut was superb. The Lemongrass Chicken Claypot had such intense flavors. We could not get enough.

Each dish has a very unique twist on traditional dishes, but still holds true to it's roots.

I cannot wait to return to devour the remaining items that we didn't have room for.

Thank you Pure!"}
{"text":"I called Pure to place an order for pick up. I ordered their sate pho and spring rolls. My order was taken at 12:10 p.m. and was told it'll be ready within 10-15 minutes. Since Pure is only a two minute walk from my office, I got to the restaurant at 12:25. I figured 15 minutes, was good enough. I get there and mentioned to the server, that I'm there to pick up my order. She checks and says that it'll probably be another 10 minutes until my order is ready. Since they were quite busy with their lunch time crowd. I figured another 10 minutes was fine and I'd just sit at the bar and wait.

Ten minutes had passed by and the server didn't even mention anything about my order. By 12:45 there was no mention of my order and I could see, that people who came after me (dine-in) customers got their orders and not mine. I decided to ask the server, if my order will be ready anytime soon. She said she'll check, but didn't inform me of anything. 

By 1:00 p.m. I decided to just leave. Since there was no sign of my order anywhere.

Pure, I understand that your kitchen was busy with your dine-in customers. But please note that people, who place take out orders are customers as well. I'm sure your food tastes good, considering the amount of people that were there. It's just highly disappointing that, the first time I place an order at your establishment was not what I had expected. Aside from that, please teach your servers to check up on customers, when they are waiting for take out."}
{"text":"Went today for take out lunch as a friend recommended the place. I had quite the disappointing and frustrating experience. This restaurant is understaffed with a disorganized waiter. I waited 10 minutes to be served. I thought the waiter had taken my order. When the waiter came back 20 min later, the waiter said \"I will ring in your order for you\". I asked if the food was ready and she said that she didn't even put it through yet. I was quite displeased and left the restaurant. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone after this experience."}
{"text":"Asian fusion. Usually the term sends me running the other direction. If it wasn't for a friend who had already tried this place asking me to meet her there for dinner, my husband and I probably would have passed it up. This is my new favourite contemporary Asian restaurant!  There is a contemporary flair to all of the dishes while maintaining the integrity and authenticity of the spices associated with the traditional Vietnamese dishes. I cannot get enough of this place. I have to give them props for their originality. Try out the Bao Down Caesar - especially at the beginning of the meal when you might be on the hungry side."}
{"text":"Was craving viet tonight and hubby wanted to bring me here for dinner since he has come here for lunch a couple of times since its right beside his work building. We started with the tenderloin tatak, it was a small portion but it was seasoned nicely and the beef was sliced thinly. I got the sate pho and i was pleasantly surprised. It was super flavorful and a bit spicier than I was use to. There was tons of noodles in there and the beef was tender. Hubby got the open faced banh mi sandwich with a side of coconut rice. I tasted a piece of the Kalbi beef and it was amazing and marinated perfectly. I would get that next time I am there. Overall for the of us it was only $41 which I thought was awesome deal and we were both full. Service was good and restaurant had a nice atmosphere. Would recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"This is my current favourite restaurant in the city. I discovered this restaurant from my Chef from culinary school at SAIT Simon Dunn who had posted some very good things to say about it. The chef nails textures and sauces in a way that is normally very overlooked by others here. I've been many times and every time I go it gets better and better. I love how affordable the food is for the quality of it. Everything is made in house to me knowledge. I read that Chef Pham had trained with Duncan Ly and I have to say that I prefer Pure to Foreign Concept. Sorry but I'm not sorry for saying that. 

Please bring back the Pomelo. My favourite dishes are the tamarind cod, wok tossed duck spring rolls, chilli tamarind wings, char soy donut, wok shaken beef, master stock chicken, peas and mushrooms, Sriracha ribs, kimchi fried rice, and the desserts. The menu is big and is constantly changing. There is still a bunch of things I haven't tried and that's a reason to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Had heard some good things about Pure and when I saw a Groupon for them come up, it was too good an opportunity to pass up. We would definitely have made it here without the Groupon, but that gave us the time crunch push we needed to try it out.

We for a very late lunch on Sunday at 3pm. we were the only people in the restaurant which wasn't surprising considering the time. There were a couple of tables that were still being cleared so guessing we just missed the last customers. While we were there a couple come in and ordered food to go. What a dangerous thing to know that I can get this tasty business to go!

We started off with a Char Siu Sesame Dounut each - order per amount you want. Pork was very tasty, with great sauce with just a little sriracha kick. Doughnut shell was crisp and very tasty. Could almost come back and have 3 of these as a slider trio. Really great way to start.

For mains we shared 2 dishes. Tried the Chicken Basil Rice, which was fresh and flavorful and a good size. Also tried the braised Pork Cheek rice which came with pineapple and fried egg on top. Pork was super tender and hardly fatty. Pineapple was a great addition, still slightly firm and added a subtle sweetness. Not sure what sauce they use in this dish but it is really really good.

Total for all items was $38, pretty good deal right there.

Really liked the food and presentation was great. Will absolutely come back to try more items. Also good to note that service was attentive and quick, but didn't feel watched even though we were the only people in there."}
{"text":"Stopped into Pure to try their happy hour - half priced appetizers from 2-5pm? Yes please!

Was a bit concerned when we walked in and there was only one table of two, but wanted to try it out. Started off with the Good Morning Vietnam (salted caramel Bailey's and Vietnamese coffee). $7.75 for a 1oz drink was pricy, but oh well. 

Ordered the surf n turf rolls, braised pork belly rolls, fried BBQ pork wontons, pork sesame donuts and the papaya & mango salad. Soooo much food that worked out to be about $23 and was decent sized portions.

My favorite was definitely the donuts - had them at Watercress back in the day and am happy Chef brought them here. A steal at $2.50 each during happy hour. 

Overall, I found the flavours to be good, the ingredients fresh and the presentation nice. Loved the value of happy hour, but wish the drink prices were better (or on special as well.) Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've become a bit of a regular at Pure; I find the wait staff to be helpful, the food is very good, especially for reasonable pricing. I strongly recommend it, especially for dinner, as the dinner menu is especially good."}
{"text":"I went there before doing my work, it is a decent bar restaurant in downtown with some creative Vietnamese dishes. I tried the chicken rice(forgot the name) for lunch. The rice is coconut rice, very tasty and flavoured. The chicken is tender and juicy. Very nice place. I will go there again."}
{"text":"I used a Groupon voucher for dinner at Pure Vietnamese. The place was dead but it was Sunday evening so understandable. I ordered a doughnut, lemongrass chicken and pork belly. The starter was the best thing. Pork belly was good enough but chicken wasn't the best. Overall, I was happy enough paying $30 with tip a without any drinks. Would I be happy paying the full price $50? Not really. It was nothing special. I will give in another go and will stick with starters."}
{"text":"This food is incredible! Definitely go for the coconut rice if you're a coconuts fan - best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Lunchtime was busy which is a good thing!  I had the seafood fried rice and it was a large portion and very good."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by our son, Matthew, who was a MasterChef Canada finalist.  Modern take on Vietnamese dishes. Love their fried rice and spring rolls.  Still have to try a lot more items.  Service is great but the night that we went, the order took longer than expected, hence the 4 stars. Otherwise, I would definitely return and recommend to others."}
{"text":"An easy rating, because we've thoroughly enjoyed all dishes (4.75 stars).

As I consider the stuffing of any Asian restaurant to be their noodle soups, and especially of Vietnamese or Chinese origins, I just had to try the pho.

Hence the sate pho: so worth it with great thin noodles, super broth is great untouched, but that which can be spiked with a combination tangy and hot sauce, plenty of tender beef slices and tasty pork sausage chunks, all in a very large bowl 3/5 full, and flavours that zinged me into almost draining every last drop. The best outside Asia so far...
Our accompanying claypot chicken was excellent: a complex blend of spices with tender pieces of marinated chicken in an oil-based sauce that was excellent. 

On our second visit, we ordered wok shaken beef and hoisin pork ribs. The tender beef sat on top of a raw watercress salad and a juicy sauce to live for. 
And the also tender ribs were smothered in their own rub and sauce near a small stack of shredded papaya with some tangy sauce alongside. With the meal came 4 steamed asian rolls that were gently flavoured with a hint of sweetness that also were great with the sauces.
Everything hit the spot. 

Ah, but the flavours and presentation of these dishes are just wonderful!
And the bowls of fluffy jasmine rice so well complemented the flavours. All was eaten to the last wee scoop.

Even the plain water tasted good: perhaps we were primed, or the flavour is from a special filter system.

Our servers were super helpful, and very much worked with Pham in the kitchen to make us sit up and yelp! As well, he/a sous chef came out to personally serve some tables, and graciously helped us enjoy. As is usual, we had asked for the full-flavoured meal lest they back off for yet another caucasian desire for less.

The quality cloth napkins with fine chopsticks and utensils suitably added to the whole affair. The interior decor is okay although somewhat dark gray and austere; not sure why, but some bright colors with darker wall motifs would be much more appealing...
But the true attraction at Pure is plainly the food!

Too bad the parking is terrible, but it's clear that the lunch trade during the week would turn a healthy profit during these stretched times, at the same time as attract a different market than on 17th Avenue. But this factor didn't seem to hurt the mostly full seats in the main dining room and outside. This alone says a lot...

We will be going back, as I think it is the best pho in the city, and try  other chicken mains, the vermicellis and other dishes.

Get over there, okay? See if it hits you the same way..."}
{"text":"The food here is so good that I'm surprised it's not busier, although my visits have only been at dinner time during the weekend, and we know how it is in downtown during those times... anyways, I love Vietnamese food, and I especially enjoy fusion/contemporary style when it's done right and not over the top.  That perfectly describes Pure.  The food has familiar flavors and ingredients yet there's also nice surprises here and there and it works so well.  I have tried about ten items off their menu and enjoyed everything.  I just want to come back for more and more.  Oh and another nice thing is the prices are so reasonable for the quality of food! If you haven't been here, you're missing out big time!!"}
{"text":"Check this place out! Located by the 8 ST C train, this is my new go to place for lunches and dinner. It's in the old Gohan space. FYI - Pure has an awesome happy hour from 2-5pm on weekdays, half off appetizers. Considering the prices are very good (for the quality and quantity), this is a steal!

I tried Chef Pham's famous kimchi fried rice, snow peas and mushrooms, papaya salad, surf and turf salad rolls and vegetarian spring rolls ( a tad too greasy). This was a lot of food for two people, bill came to about $60 with two glasses of wine. Everything was delicious, fresh and flavourful, perfectly cooked. We left stuffed and happy. 

There are a few chefs I would follow around in the city, where ever they go. Chef Pham (formerly of Watercress) is one of them."}
{"text":"Was in the building for training, figured it was close and convenient...
Had the Pork-Chicken and Spring Roll Vermicelli.  It was ok.  Compared to other Vietnamese restaurants downtown, portion was smaller price was higher and favour was just ok.  The price was a bit higher, but not overly so."}
{"text":"This is a great contemporary spin on Vietnamese. Char sui donut is a must. Personally like the lunch offerings a bit more than dinner but everything is still delicious. Kimchi fried rice is excellent. Restaurant has a very \"clubbing\" setting but the food is worth the visit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The way they blend each different flavor is truly divine.   Very reasonably priced and the portions were filling. Staff was friendly and attentive and a very nice atmosphere.  Best food in the city, that's for sure.  5*"}
{"text":"Very disappointing and greasy pho soup, I've had pho all over the city there is no reason to put out a product like this and charge a premium when you're just eating a bowl of oil with your noodles and beef."}
{"text":"This was the first time we tried Pure - we are a group of six people for my birthday. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food taste fresh, beautifully arranged and the dish combinations are imaginative. We would definitely go back and highly recommend Pure to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food... AWESOME service.... reasonable prices. Went there for a friend's birthday and they went above and beyond to provide a great evening for us. Try the Chicken Claypot the Coconut Rice and the tacos."}
{"text":"Will definitely be back.  I was there on a Saturday around 4pm and the place was empty.  I can't understand why because the facility is clean, aesthetic, staff are incredibly friendly, and the food is amazing.  Its setup around a bar/lounge layout so I expect they're busy in the late evenings. They won't steer you wrong with recommendations.  The Basil Chicken Fried Rice was some of the best I've had anywhere.  I don't have Vietnamese often, but this place is among my favorites.  Its right off a train stop too.  Its about a 5 minute walk from the train stop to Pure and its relatively easy to find.  Enjoy your meals!"}
{"text":"The grease was so bad in my soup that it left a lip gloss like feeling on our lips after every bite. There was a quarter inch of grease clearly visible floating on top of my bowl. One of the worst bowls of Pho I've over had."}
{"text":"Come for the food, not the ambience. After many consecutive days for Alberta beef, we were craving something other than grilled meat. The char siu sesame donut was, interestingly, a nice combination of flavors and textures: the sweetness and savoriness of the char siu combined with the mildly sweet and slightly gooey on the inside and the crispy on the outside sesame donut worked well together. The pork spring rolls came out piping hot - excellent crispy texture to bite into and the tangy and sweet Thai chili sauce complemented the savory pork filling nicely. The lemongrass chicken vermicelli was the biggest surprise - I wasn't expected much, but the chicken was so chock full of an amazing lemongrass, aromatic, sweet and savory flavor. This combined with the bean sprouts, carrots, peanuts, and scallions made for a very satisfying bowl of humbly delicious vermicelli. Docking one star for the ambience though - the blue lighting, fake flowers, slightly greasy tables and gaudy clubby decor make it seem more like a night club than a restaurant whose food is to be taken seriously."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese restaurant in downtown Calgary. I'm here on a business trip and was just looking for some food near the client office. We came in on a Tuesday evening fairly early (around 5PM) and the place was empty. 

We ordered the chili chicken wings, springs rolls and I had the sateh pho (beef, flank brisket, beef balls). The chicken wings were fanstastic, crispy skin and seasoned very nicely. The Pho was the highlight. Super flavourful soup, with thin noodles (my fav) and generous serving of meat.

Restaurant is physically modern, with nice seating and renos. Pricing is on the higher end but is justified with the restaurant atmosphere and service (in comparison to typical vietnamese restaurants in Toronto - where I am from)."}
{"text":"Okay.... so I'm updating my review from 4 stars to 5 stars because Pure consistently blows me away with quality and flavour. 

Everything I said in my last review remains to be true with respect to the amazing quality and flavour of the food offered here. In fact, I've been here at least 10 times since my last review and the Pho just keeps getting better and better. I would venture to say that this is the best Pho I've had in calgary. The meat is good quality and the flavours are so robust and deep in the broth. I can't exactly place it, but the pho stands out in uniqueness compared to a regular bowl of pho in the city, which I'll chalk up to the \"contemporary\" part of the Pure namesake. 

Upon my most recent visit, I learned that they are now also going to be doing wing night wednesdays, with 35c wings (or $10 AYCE wings), which I'm sure will have crazy awesome flavours so I can't wait for that. 

Excellent restaurant with reasonable prices given the quality. While the location is central, it's too bad this awesome place is beside a derelict apartment building and a sketchy convenience store with no parking lot!"}
{"text":"We tried the grilled chicken rolls, char siu sesame bun, kimchi fried rice, shrimp papaya mango salad and the pho.  All the food was very tasty.  We all enjoyed the food very much and we all agreed that we would come back.    Our party had some food customization which they were happy to oblige with."}
{"text":"Came here to try this place out during lunch with a friend using a Groupon.  Quite busy during lunch time, so I would recommend if you need to be in and out quick, know what you want to order by looking at the picture of the menu first online so you can order immediately when you are seated.  The menu on here is a still current, but there were more offerings available including a Banh Xeo taco.

Service wasn't great, food was out pretty quick but the table next to us who ordered after us didn't get their food until we were already finished eating which is why you will want to order quick if possible.

We shared the Chili Lime Nuoc Cham chicken wings which were tasty.  Could've used more of the sauce to really coat the chicken.  I also had the Lemongrass Chicken Banh Mi with a side of chicken soup.  The banh mi was good, bread was a bit over toasted which meant it was too crunchy.  The chicken soup was also nice and flavorful with some Asin napa cabbage, however I believe the MSG was strong and would rather have no MSG in it.  My friend had the Pho which was great.  However, the soup also had lots of MSG and we were both chugging waters in the afternoon.  

Food was good, would've given 4 stars if they did away with the MSG.  Flavor profile was great and I believe it would've been able to carry through without the MSG."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! the ingredients are fresh and all the dishes we ordered were amazing.  This is going to be our new go to Vietnamese restaurant - I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Chef Lam Pham left Watercress (which is still open and still delicious, incidentally) to spread his wings with something a bit more formal and a bit more adventurous and has given us Pure Vietnamese Kitchen in what was most recently Gohan Sushi at 815 8th Ave SW, across from Nexen and Century Gardens Park. Don't be put off by the bland exterior; the interior is classy and comfortable, with good music at a tolerable level, nice seating, and most importantly, absolutely delicious food at incredibly good prices given the quality (and this factor he did carry over from Watercress).

I want to recommend two things, but note that I still have a lot of the menu to sample: The char siu sesame \"donut\" and the lobster and shrimp fried rice. The former is a fried sweet-ish sesame donut like you'll sometimes see on dim sum carts, but it's split and stuffed with char siu barbecued pork and spicy mayo- it is DELICIOUS, addictive and a rich treat that's a good deal at $5. The fried rice is as perfect as it ever was when Lam was at Watercress and is full of shrimp, lobster claw and dried scallop, topped with salty fish roe so you get \"seafood\" on many levels and the whole experience is decadent and again completely delicious.

PCVKB is currently open 7 days and I hope it remains so- the west end of Stephen Ave (west of 5 St) is dead as a doornail on weekends but somebody has to take the risk to change that and I love the idea that I can visit this place anytime I care too, weekends included. Highly, hugely recommended."}
{"text":"I live nearby and order takeout from Pure regularly.  I've loved everything I've ever had. Always shows up hot, and fresh. I love how the veggies are always crisp and fresh not frozen! Definitely recommend to anyone.  My faves are the pho, chicken salad rolls, and gailan :9 great value!!"}
{"text":"It's a modern Vietnamese restaurant with good ambience, delicious food, and an environment conducive to cracking some serious major jokes tempered with intellectual Convo. 

It wasn't on the menu but we asked for a veggie version of the pho. She said yes but said that the broth would either be beef or chicken. Had we called 24 hours in advance they would have had veggie broth for us. Next time for sure. 

We were OK with the chicken broth. It was very tasty, lots of flavor. Veggies were excellent and noodles not bad. 

My lunch companion asked if there was tofu. She said yes, and the tofu was good as well.

The man next to us ordered chicken wings which smelled & looked delicious. Music was loud but appropriate instrumental Asian sounds. And when we started snap chatting and laughing loudly, no problem! Good clean Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!!!!!! We just landed in Calgary and found this place on Yelp. The Cha Siu sesame donut totally caught my eye, so I made my hubs pass up up on the outdoor happy hours on 8th to come here to eat. Lol!!
We had the Char siu  sesame donut, Crispy pork belly baos and the kimchee fried rice..... OMG, beyond words!!!!!
Everything was flavorful and perfect portions to be able to try different things. 
I also had the Yuzu lemon sake and ended up having two"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise and we are so glad we discovered it! The dishes here can be described as 'elevated vietnamese' dishes with elements of thai and korean. Do not worry - it is nothing like the horrible asian fusion places that exist out there. We tried most of the items on the menu and it was all super tasty! Our favorites include the chicken claypot with its yummy lemongrass flavour, the cod, garlic butter chicken wings, kimchi fried rice, the scallop and the cha sui sesame donut (i grew up eating these donuts and never thought to fill it with chasui). Even the simple fried egg noodle side dish was awesome.  I hear they also have a great happy hour deal where all their appetizers are 50% off! That means I can get a yummy scallop for $3 :) We will be back for more good food soon."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and feel good food. Service was quick for a lunch time stop during the work week. We ordered the pork rolls and the wonton soup. Both were so tasty and an amazing price for the portion. Definitely recommend this delicious viet restaurant on the west end."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The atmosphere, environment, exceptional service, presentation and tasty food are Fabulous. This is, hands down, my top pick for a restaurant for Vietnamese food in Calgary!"}
