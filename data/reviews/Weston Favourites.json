{"text":"It's a perfect quick slice. Nothing fancy nice fresh, good cheese. It's a neighbourhood joint. Approval from a local.  the pops are ice cold which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Weston favorites pizza, is an old home style type of pizzeria. The service that you will find there is far better than you will ever receive at any other pizzeria in town. The pizza itself is so perfectly done, the toppings that they use are the freshest that they can find. I'll be honest with you when they first opened there was a few hiccups that they had but they corrected those rather quickly. The owner had to have been exceedingly brave to open up a pizzeria practically right across the street from a well-known chain pizza store. But Weston favourites pizza are able to deliver a far superior product at the same price as a major chain pizza store. If you're ever looking for the best pizza outside of Italy head over to Weston's favorite pizza it surely will not disappoint."}
