{"text":"This is the best Chinese food around! Always great ! We've tried a lot different ones. By far #1 on  my list!!"}
{"text":"Definitely the freshest Asian cuisine I have ever had. Very high quality food. You can't beat the lunch prices"}
{"text":"The good news is they got here fast. The bad news is the quality was poor and the experience underwhelming. The hot and sour soup tasted like the color brown and nothing else. The bourbon chicken was sweet and sour chicken in a brown glaze, a first for bourbon chicken in my experience, being fried. And the curry chicken suffered from the same fear of seasoning that doomed the other two items. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Good food, great looking place overall. Staff could use some more social skills. They are very blunt and unfriendly. Whenever I call to make pickup orders they they ask what I want and then say \"ok bye\". At least a thank you would be nice. But a ways other issue is the pricing , other places nearby have cheaper prices and even provide bigger portions. The flavor isn't perfect here but it's good enough."}
{"text":"this place is legit. I got the sesame chicken and it came with tons of chicken and fried rice. the place was clean and very quite. No doubt that i will be going back."}
{"text":"Two words: food poisoning. If you're trying to lose a fast ten pounds from a terrible stomach bug, this is your restaurant. Otherwise, you may want to reconsider."}
{"text":"I live directly across the street from B7.  I finally stopped in for takeout on my way home last night from work.  The Yelp reviewts are outstanding.   I was not disappointed.  Since it was already after 8 and I was starving, I chose the chicken lo mein.  

I was immediately acknowledged when I came in and quickly handed a menu, and give time to choose my order.  While waiting for the lo mein I found the location quaint, smaller than expected yet cozy, too.  Small nice bar in the front and the main dining separated from it by a screen.  Low lighting and cushioned chairs for the tables.  Very relaxing atmosphere with, of course a fish tank.  

Then menu includes classic chinese, some vietnamese and japanese selections.  My chicken lo mein was piping hot, very savory and loaded with plenty of meat.  Glad I finally made it there.  I do wish they had a sushi menu and maybe a bit more japanese selections."}
{"text":"First time I ate there I loved it.
I ate in the restaurant.
Next time I carried out the same order and was un- satisfied ."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the BEST food. Everything was cooked perfectly, and their sauces are to die for. Portions are big and they don't skimp on any meat in their dishes. Their appetizers are amazing. And when we ordered a big takeout order they offered a free two-liter of soda. Definitely going back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Small place. Very rarely is there anyone in the dining room. But quick takeout. Very hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but this is not a Pad Thai, the food was awful... the service.. nobody checked on us, I have to look for somebody to bring me the bill. Never ever back here!!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese/Thai takeout in Ballantyne.  The owner, Anna, is always extremely friendly, will soon know you by name, and can tell you what your order is before you've even placed it!  We are lucky to have Bamboo 7 in walking distance because you can't beat the menu, the prices, and most importantly, the quality and flavor profiles.  Everything is super fresh!   It even offers a nice, intimate setting for dining-in and a more elegant menu of House Specialties that go well above and beyond typical Chinese takeout items.  We love this place."}
{"text":"The food is great ..we had curry chicken . sesame chicken and tempura shrimp .hot and sour soup .all of  the food was great ..."}
{"text":"This place had good reviews so we tried it , it got busy but u could hear the phone ring every five seconds so I cod see this being a take out only place . I love Chinese and this place was not good it was edible and that's all .. We will not be back"}
{"text":"Pleasant Chinese food to go. We ordered take out so I cannot evaluate the restaurant. I tried the sesame chicken and it had a pleasant flavor if slightly salty. The egg rolls were crisp and tasty. Note-They only take credit cards online for delivery orders."}
{"text":"Loved it. Crunchy batter fried chkn with pineapple. delicious lettuce wraps. Quaint and casual but nice, very clean. Went late lunch on a Sunday, just our table. Nice and quiet."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Good food, service and atmosphere.  After a few visits, they know your order before you place it, which is cool.  The owner is really nice, and the staff is very attentive.  Highly recommned this place.  Nice little hidden gem in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"We were a bit hesitant to stop in casually with the family because we were not sure of the pricing but were we ever surprised.  As long as you make conscious choices, the menu can fit any budget!  
The food was absolutely great and the presentation was amazing.

The only drawback I saw was the size. Small and intimate, any more than a handful of customers can make this restaurant fill up in a hurry.  If it is not busy, this little hide-a-way is a great night out to start a night on the town as well."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch on Saturday between 12 - 1 and was the only person in the place.  Of course, since I was the only dine-in patron at the time, my service was super-quick.  

I decided that I wanted something semi-healthy, so I ordered chicken with broccoli and steamed rice instead of fried rice.  The plate came with a small spring roll as well. 
 
The food was pretty good but not the very best I have had. For a small Asian place in a strip shopping center though, I thought the quality of the food was pretty good.

And,  I certainly have no complaints about the service -it was good. Pricing for lunch was cheap -  only $5.95 before tax! You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better Asian restaurants in the area (and I've been to quite a few).  They offer a nice variety of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Japanese dishes.  They also have a good lunch menu at very reasonable prices for their quality, which is above-average compared to others in the area.  The restaurant is nice and clean so it's a nice place to dine in.  They also offer takeout and delivery, and at those prices, there's no reason to ever order from those fast food takeouts."}
{"text":"I just discovered Bamboo 7 a couple weeks ago and I have literally been here like 5 times since. I'm an Asian food addict and this place is an amazing fix.

From the outside, you might not be too sure. To be honest, I wasn't sure if it was even open when I saw it the first time. I gave it a whirl and the inside was very clean and nice looking I knew it had potential. We've all been to that hole in the wall Chinese place that ended up being terrible but this isn't that place. Bamboo 7 is a gem.

My server is always so friendly and nice and at this point, she knows my order. I get the wonton soup and the pork potstickers. Sort of the same thing but they're my favorites. The wonton soup is so good. The broth has a great flavor and a lot of depth and the wontons are not falling apart in the soup either. The only thing I wish was different about the soup is that it had some veggies in there, but I know that' not the traditional way. The potstickers. DAMN, THEY ARE GOOD. These things are my favorite, I don't think I can come here without getting them. They even come in the authentic basket thing and even though they are steamed, hey are al dente and never slimy. 

Someone said this place is the best Chinese in Charlotte - I believe it."}
{"text":"So glad I was able to find a Chinese restaurant that is A) excellent and B) delivers.  My family ordered delivery for the first time recently and the staff was friendly, the delivery was fast and the food we received was hot and delicious.  Cannot wait to order again."}
{"text":"Nice for a special occasion with reasonable prices. Unique and creative  presentation. Food is very good."}
{"text":"(10/11/17) Well there was an accident when I arrived home so there wasn't any power, so my wife didn't want to cook. So after thinking about all the different restaurants in the area we decided on Bamboo 7. When we got here it was empty and it was about as hot as it is outside. Apparently the AC was off but its back to getting comfortable in here. I've ordered an egg roll and a bowl of white corn bisque. I also ordered orange beef. They are out of ginger ale so I'm having sweet tea. My wife ordered egg drop soup fried tofu and some dumplings.

When the orange beef arrived it was finally at a hot & spicy level that I could enjoy. All attempts before this fell flat. It was nice that the spiciness didn't overwhelm the flavor of the dish. Everything else, the egg rolls, the soup & the service were right on target."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! The service was exceptional. They made sure we had what we needed but did not hover. I had the chow fun noodle dish with pork and beef and my husband had the chicken lo mein. Both were fantastic! They also did not hesitate when I asked for both beef and pork. This will be our regular chinese place."}
{"text":"My orange chicken is always bland and extremely fatty. I'd recommend just saving your money and go else where."}
{"text":"I'm sure there are good entrees at this place, but when I look for Chinese food, I'm looking for a good deal on the lunch combos.  In this area, I feel like Bamboo 7 totally fails.  All you get is a small portion of whatever dish you have chosen and some rice with soy sauce.  To call it fried rice is an insult to fried rice.  Give me some veggies and egg in the rice at the very least!  No egg roll or spring roll included either, had to order these separate and pay extra."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices and yes they do deliver.  I just wish they would bring down the minimum order for delivery from $15 to $10.  Sometimes I just don't want that much food for lunch."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food delivery! We've never eaten int he restaurant, but we order take out weekly from Bamboo. Service is always quick and the food is fresh and hot. Our favorites are Sweet and Sour Chicken and General Sho's Chicken. Crab Rangoons are tasty. Hot and Sour Soup is a bit generic, but still good. Don't bother is the fried rice (at least not the option in place of your rice side) - it's just rice with soy sauce on it. The chicken lo mein is good, but I wish there were more veggies than onions and sprouts."}
{"text":"The pho noodle soup is decent but the service was pretty bad. We tried to be nice to the waitress and asked her name but she seemed insulted by our attempts to be nice. I asked her for extra hoisin and hot sauce and she said she will get me more after  first i finish the ones she gave me. Then she was on a prolonged phone argument with another customer. My tip will be 0. Don't know if I will return even after I recomended this place to workmates."}
{"text":"I stopped in after work for some Pork Chow Fun.  I love that I can cross the border from NC to SC and find Chinese  Restaurants that serve Chow Fun.  Bamboo 7 serves some of the best.  I have stopped  here several  times and ordered take out.  The hostess is friendly and efficient and the fellow who brought my food out from the kitchen was gracious and professional.  The Money Bags appetizer is very good and I like the way they do their chicken wings.  The only thing I have eaten from here that I did not like was the Lo Mein.  Other than that everything has been delicious."}
{"text":"If there were a 0 I'd give it.  Came in for lunch after a work appt and grabbed a menu.  Waited at the front counter for about 10 to 15 minutes , saw 2 roaches, in a completely empty restaurant before a man finally came out.  I began to place my order and he interrupted me and said  I was too late to order food.  I showed him on the menu that I was well within the listed time and over an hour before the cut off.  He said i don't know when we serve lunch but you leave now I no cook for you I'm busy.  Not sure how but I won't be back.  I feel awful for whoever has left a menu for this place on my door 4 days in a row but they're wasting their time ."}
{"text":"Worst meal, I've ever had!! I started feeling sick while I was eating. It's the next morning and I still feel terrible. The noodles tasted like they had been sitting in grease all day. The chicken was horrible. Overall it was just a bad meal that was not cheap. $35 dollars in the trash!!! I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in Charlotte!!  Sui Mui is great and the beef chow fun and chicken and beef brocolli all fantastic!!"}
{"text":"This our favorite delivery place, but they have a nice restaurant too. Very small but nice ambience. They are courteous, even when calling in an order near closing. They always get the order right and are fast. Large portion sizes with plenty of meat and veggies. We ordered for 4 the other night and got a free 2-liter, which was unexpected but nice. They pay attention to detail and add little touches like cucumber with shrimp sauce on the side when you order crab rangoon. Pad Thai is excellent. Fried rice has flavor. Fried veggie spring rolls are small but are perfectly crispy. Order plenty-you will want more! Crab rangoon is the best I've ever had. Prices may be a little higher than other delivery places, but the food definitely tastes better than most Chinese/Thai takeout. So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I eat here often when I'm looking to get some Asian takeout.  The staff is always friendly and eager to help!

The chicken fried rice and General Tso's chicken are favorites of mine.  Their lunch specials are cheap and tasty.  Two of my lunch favorites are the egg drop soup and the wonton soup.  Both are very cheap ($1.50 and $1.95, I think) and just down right good.

I've had the Pad Thai here as well.  It's good but a little sweet for me sometimes.  I like my Pad Thai a little spicer, but it's still pretty good.  

I give them a solid 4 stars for the entrees that I've had so far!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Bamboo 7 since they opened, and I was so considerably disappointed tonight that I must write this. I ordered take out: 1 egg roll, an appetizer order of the Salt and Pepper Calamari, and Shrimp with Garlic Sauce (sub-Chicken Fried Rice for white/brown rice). 

The egg roll was dismal. A tiny offering compared to a normal egg roll and browned almost until burnt; incredibly mushy on the inside. One bite and didn't finish it. I will never order this again. The Salt and Pepper Calamari - which I have enjoyed many times from this restaurant - was horrible. Cooked almost until the coating was rock solid, the calamari had shrunk completely inside the coating. This left me with rock hard coating and small pieces of severely overcooked calamari which I did not want to dig for. Additionally, the portion received was probably 2/3rds of what is usually provided. I tossed most of it, no reason to eat hard coating.

Finally, we get to the Shrimp with Garlic Sauce and Chicken Fried Rice on the side (sub for white or brown rice). What I expect from this restaurant, based on previous experience, is crisp vegetables with a somewhat spicy sauce, and a considerable amount of shrimp cooked just until they are done. What I got was 100% the opposite. A total of eight shrimp in a huge container of vegetables, all of the shrimp had a mushy consistency. The vegetables were soggy and sad, and the sauce had zero taste. I ate a couple of the shrimp, hoping they would get better, but no. Most of this went into the trash. 

Chicken Fried Rice....tiny scraps of chicken, no flavor, also ended in the trash.

So.....$24.00 for a meal of which the majority landed in the trash. I'm actually pissed off beyond belief that they would knowingly serve me this take out meal for that price. Never again. :("}
{"text":"Good take out option. We got the beef chow fun, chinese cabbage and tofu soup, and sesame chicken. Online order was really easy and food ready fast. It was very tasty."}
{"text":"Turn back, this is not the Asian food you're looking for. There are plenty of better options around; in fact, almost all of the other options are better options. Rarely have I ever felt genuinely depressed about spending a substantial amount of money on food, but this seriously just brought me down to a new low and left me full of nothing but regret. Were it not for intense military training that left me a hardened and emotionless being, I might have wept after my experience. The food is not of the quality that anyone would expect for the dinner prices. Truly, the only redeeming features were the friendly delivery driver and my dog loved it after my wife dumped her hibachi chicken in its bowl (the same dog also likes to eat dirty socks and used dryer sheets for comparison).

I had General Tso's chicken with fried rice and crab rangoons, my wife had the Hibachi chicken and shrimp. Her Hibachi chicken was just sad, poor quality and dry, no flavor whatsoever. The vegetables that came with it were not hot and seemed barely cooked. My crab rangoons were the worst of any I've had and I always get them at every Asian restaurant. Frankly, I'm just sad and disappointed, not how any meal should leave someone feeling."}
{"text":"Yum!  Bamboo 7 is awesome! How awesome?
Well...who else do you know that delivers delicious pho (Vietnamese rice noodle soup)? They deliver and its amazing. I've had pho is many authentic Vietnamese restaurants around town, and while their broth is far from the best, their meat is very tender and really makes the dish crave-worthy. I also love that they have a few dim sum selections on their menu. Whenever you're craving a little shumai, just call up Bamboo 7 and have it delivered, or venture to their restaurant where the owner is super nice, and the dining area is clean and well decorated."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We got takeout and the food was excellent. They did forget my spring rolls, but we're very apologetic and the food made up for it. I had to drive by multiple Chinese restaurants to get to this one. Absolutely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. I ordered take out house special fried rice 2 baby shrimp and the egg roll
Was half the size of a regular egg roll terrible terrible terrible"}
{"text":"My family owns the martial arts school in the shopping center so we are neighbors to Bamboo so we also come done often. And I have to say I have no problem with that. The food here is absolutely amazing I am still yet to find a Chinese restaurant that can beat the quality of these guys their food is very good and over the almost I believe 5~6 years that we've been eating here they have yet to fail on making us happy, and their food has yet to disappoint me as well. The owner, Anna, is very personal and very nice, she can look tired at times but she does not let that affect her. If you want good Chinese food for a fair price you've got to come to Bamboo. I've had numerous different dishes here and they are all very tasty and flavorful."}
{"text":"This Chinese place is so so so clean I love it. The food has a very very fresh taste. The attention is beyond awesome must try it out."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery tonight for the first time because this restaurant had 4 Stars on Yelp.  Delivery was timely, but the food was definitely not 4 star quality. We debated between 2 and 3 stars until we bit into stale fortune cookies.  That settled it. Two stars"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch or take-out spot. speedy, tasty and well priced. I've been going to this place for years. The soups, chicken and broccoli and noodles are all good choices. You can't beat a lunch special for under $6 bucks. They even deliver locally."}
