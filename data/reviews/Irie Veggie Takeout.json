{"text":"Another i-tal/vegan restaurant in Toronto.
Looking for vegan food that is wholesome, prepared from scratch, preservative and conservative-free? Once you eat the chickpea stew, you will realize that most vegetarian places are using tinned beans/peas. Not Irie. Here you find boiled from dry beans, fresh veggies, fresh juices etc. No salt. Irie is an I-tal shop. The only thing I would fix-I wish the spices were a bit more evident in the food..

Update your address books: The address on yelp is wrong. The shop is now closer to Dufferin, on the south side: 2593 Eglinton Ave W"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! When Veez Vegan Caribbean wasn't open and I was in the area, this place was my only vegan option. I timidly went in and asked the Jamaican man behind the counter to give me whatever he thought I might like as a vegan. I specified that I eat gluten/wheat free, and he understood what I meant (even though I was unsure if he would know). It was so good though. I had no clue what I was eating because honestly, I didn't ask, but it was VERY good. Amazing flavours !!! Definitely worth going out of my way to make a Yelp review for. The only thing is that there is not much parking in the area. Other than that, the prices are HALF of what Veez Vegan's prices are. It is a BARGAIN, and a very very tasty one too. I'd suggest going here if you like Carribbean/Ital flavours, and especially if you're vegan/vegetarian. Peaceeeee"}
{"text":"It is always difficult to find Ital Stew in the north end of the city and Irie Veggie has quickly become my favourtie spot.

I only ever get the Ital Stew which is amazing and if it was not more than 20 minutes from my house I would be a weekly regular. 

Check it out if you are going to be in the area.

{"text":"Found this place, thanks to Yelp, when I was in this area of the city that I don't know very well. It was just what I wanted -- a quick, simple, vegetable-heavy meal. There's some seating but it's more of a takeout spot. Just ask what they have that day. The food is kept in these metal containers with lids, so you can't really see anything on display. I just did an assortment of beans, tofu, a spinach-y stew, and some salad on top of rice. It was super filling and $8. I'm not that familiar with ital food, but the man working at the desk was very friendly and helpful in explaining things to me."}
