{"text":"Would give 3.5 if I could. 

Made reservations for dinner and decided we wanted to sit on the patio so saw very little of the interior of the restaurant. The patio itself is quite small but we were the only people out there and since this restaurant is set back from Lakeshore, it was quite pleasant. 

The food was very good and worthy of more stars. The bread served at the table was incredibly fresh. Since this is a wine bar, there's a decent selection of wines and we tried something we hadn't heard of before. I had the veal chop special which was served with two large and yummy prawns. I wish I had been asked how I liked my veal as it served well done and I prefer more medium rare. For dessert, I had tiramisu which was excellent. 

My problem with this restaurant was the service. Our server was friendly at the beginning but we had a couple of problems. My grandfather is a 93 year old man that can't hear well and can't speak all that clearly. The server misunderstood what he ordered and when utensils were brought out for the food, it was clear there had been a mistake. Instead of apologizing for it, the server got defensive and said that she had repeated the order and no one corrected it. She went back to the kitchen and corrected it, then came out and asked him if he was ok with that. He said of course, because it's what he ordered and she said yes, you better be ok with that. She started off quite friendly, and she ended quite friendly, but this caused some tension. 

My other complaint would be the amount of time it took. From sitting down to being served food it was 45 minutes. Similarly, from ordering desserts to getting them it was about another 15 minutes. I can't comment on how busy the restaurant was because we weren't inside but this still felt lengthy to me. 

Not sure if we'll be back. It was good food with a slow kitchen and weird blips of anger from the server."}
{"text":"I love this place always so nice we go quite often great pasta meat fish salads pizza. Wine list is great. Nice family owned. Never had a bad meal. Ever. And truffle fries are still amazing!!! And great special dinners. Valentine's. Mother's Day , New Years ,,, Ect...."}
{"text":"The food was really good.  We had vegetarian pastas, and risotto balls.

If I could give 4.5 stars I would.

The server and host were also friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that is definitely a local gem.  I stopped in one night after having seen the restaurant pop up as a Yelp event spot.....I also happened to be at the post office nearby and saw that it was seafood week!

I ended up ordering the calamari as a starter.  It was excellent.  I also ordered the surf and turf (I have included a picture). Both the lobster and the steak were done to perfection!

They also had an old school cocktail menu, so I enjoyed dinner with a couple of Negronis.  I hadn't planned on dessert, but I was talked into it, and was glad I was, even though I didn't finish and had to take the cannolis home. 

Solstice can also host larger groups as there is a semi-private room that can be used.

I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"The decor is modern and simple with a moderate amount of seating. They also have a private dining area. I had crab cakes that were delicious and the arugula salad. Both were light, yet filling proportions. One friend I was with had the seafood risotto that he finished off entirely (obviously it was to his standards) and my other friend had a hearty-sized pork shank that he said he would have enjoyed more without the port fig jus, though I think he just doesn't care for port or figs in the first place. I'd like to go back here to try other items. However, our server could have been more attentive. She visited the table plenty, but it took her 3 visits to realize my water needed refilled. Overall, the experience was good!"}
{"text":"Came back for the 2018 winter edition of Taste of Clarkson, and the experience was just as good as last time!

(You know I couldn't stay away after the dinner last year.)

I once again gathered up a group of friends and ventured out in the midst of a heavy snowstorm to get in for the final weekend of the promotion, which had an entirely different menu and cost us about $40 per person after taxes.

They had a large number of choices. Appetizers we ordered included:

Beef Carpaccio (my choice): Extremely-thin slices of rich, fatty, melt-in-your-mouth beef under a bed of arugula and balsamic vinaigrette.  I had to augment it with a metric ton of bread (I was starving because I hadn't eaten anything all day), but the beef was delicious and the balsamic dressing hit the spot.

Pasta e Fagioli soup: Macaroni pasta and vegetables in a huge bowl of rich vegetable(?) broth. Two of my companions had this and both reported that it hit the spot, considering how cold it was outside. 

For mains, both myself and one other ordered the Osso Bucco (veal shanks), which included a big, fatty piece of fall-apart-on-the-fork veal, a piece of marrow (which you could eat the meat out of) over a bed of rich risotto. You want something that will hit the spot on a cold night? This is it, full of flavour and rich goodness, and left me wanting a second order.

My other companions also opted for the salmon on a bed of vegetables (they had cod, but ran out due to how popular it was) and big plates of garganelli with a rich cream sauce, sausage and zucchini. Everyone reported that the meals were delicious, and the service was A-one as always - constant refills of drinks, bread and the classic layout of cutlery.

Although I was originally going to opt in for a pie jar like the Canada 150 cheesecake last time, it quickly became clear that the only sane option was to go for the Sicilian bread pudding with Panettone, which was served with a big dollop of whipped cream and was the perfect capper to the evening. Because one of my friends was too full, he offered me his dessert and I got two for the price of one!

Solstice is one of a select few restaurants (including Ruth's Chris and Canyon Creek) that I'd follow around the city if it meant having a culinary experience that's this consistently good. I'm looking forward to the next visit, and the experience was a particular highlight so early in 2018.

As always, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Solstice was difficult to find as it is set in a little bit from Lakeshore.  The menu offers quite a variety: pasta, pizza, meat and seafood.  My pasta meal was simple, yet well-prepared.  The restaurant décor is modern and simple.  Food and service were good, but nothing memorable.  The prices are reasonable for a restaurant downtown Clarkson.

I just discovered they offer customers the option to bring their own wine, and as an added bonus there is no corkage fee charged on Mondays or Tuesdays.  They also offer a Private Room for functions."}
{"text":"I was their at a yelp event and I parked the car, looked at the restaurant and said to myself isn't this small for Y.E.E but as I stepped in the place was nice, clean, big, gorgeous, classy restaurant (*perfect for dates*bookmark it!). 

The staff was friendly as I was greeted when walking in and out, plus the all the servers were very friendly and nice.

Their food didn't disappoint either... The starters were great but crab cakes and smoked salmon on a rye bread were to die for. The mini burgers felt like having a mini steak in a bun cooked to perfection. The Pizzas weren't far off in the list, it felt like having a pizza in Italy as they were properly done on thin crust dough. To top it all up, trays came flying with puff pastries hand crafted by the chef himself for the fellow yelpers. These pastries were done just right light and puffy and sweet to the right amount. 

Over all great experience!"}
{"text":"Last night a group of GTA yelpers decided to take part in their first dinner during the recent launched Savour Mississauga. The great thing about promotions like this is that they encourage you to get out into your local community and try restaurants again or for the first time.

I chose Solstice because of its great $35 prix fixe menu, and the fact that it was a virtual unknown to the Yelp community. Nestled in the heart of the Mississauga neighbourhood of Clarkson Village (Southdown Rd and Lakeshore W), Solstice is Italian fine dining where they believe in producing a quality product and experience from the moment you enter.

My Yelp amigo Bernie C has already regaled you with the details of the meal so I'll focus on the items I ate that were different and the extra details I found out on speaking with Vince (one of the owners). 

For my appetizer I decided to go with the Soup of the Day, as opposed to Bernies Charcuterie style platter, which today was a shrimp bisque . I could smell the creamy shrimp aromas from the moment it was walked into the dining room, and that same smell followed exactly as the velvety texture of the soup slid across my tongue. The best parts about this dish was that while it had a shrimp smell and taste, neither of them were overwhelming, a well balanced dish overall. ALSO, the soup of the day portion size was wonderful, no skimping as a full piping hot bowl was put out before me.

Similar to many others at our table we took the road more frequently traveled and ordered the surf and turf entree. The shrimp were succulent and perfectly cooked (so you got that \"pop\" when you pit into one). As for the steak and seasonal veggies, a perfect 7oz medium rare cut of beef sliced up real nice for me in advance!

To close off my meal I decided to avoid the sweets and have the cheese platter, which with my luck today had blue cheese, hunks of parmigianno, a smoked cheddar and a slice of brie. Paired with some fresh fruit, a double espresso (which kept me up until 4am this morning) and a light Amaro digestivo I was in Italo-heaven!!!

Without delving too much further into the culinary mastery of this place, I will say that for a restaurant week prix fixe menu, the Solstice brings some serious value to the table. If this is an indication into the type of work they do day to day, I'd highly recommend you pay them a visit anytime of year!

Some parting fun facts about Solstice:
- Owned by 3 brothers
- Their mother makes the in house biscotti (which we got to sample last night)
- The have the largest private dining room in Mississauga inside a restaurant which can host 90 guests (perfect for corporate functions or special occasions)

Looking forward to a return to Solstice in the near future when they release a highly-anticipated new item on their menu which will blow your socks off... stay tuned!!!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Great service with exceptional meals!
The Calamari was cooked to perfection.
The Veal Chop with Tiger Shrimp and Veggies was amazing.
The service was amazing. I don't think I ever poured  my own wine once.
Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a very pleasant gentleman.  Unfortunately he seated us in the upper right section of the restaurant that was very noisy with children.  We asked to be moved to the lower, much quieter section of the restaurant, and it was obvious our server took umbrage with that.
She presented menus and then went to the wine bar to fold napkins and ignore us for a good 20 minutes.  I had to wave to her to tell her we would like to have a pre dinner drink. It took another 20 minutes to get our drinks.  The place was not that busy!  It was early!  My husbands steak was just okay.  I ordered the Shrimp Strega.  It was a half dozen of semi thawed medium sized shrimp in a sickenly sweet aperitif sauce accompanied by a few carrot sticks, some green beans and dry white rice.  Our server had no interest in checking with us during the meal, and seemed to be wishing she was anywhere but there on that particular night.  Worst service I have encountered in many moons and very pedestrian food.  Won't return."}
{"text":"Overall this restaurant was quite mediocre. 

The fried mozzarella and calamari were delicious. For my entrée, I had the Spaghetti al Pescetore which I would not recommend. It lacked flavour and the tomato sauce was nothing special. I tried my boyfriend's  Pappardelle con Fungi which I also didn't like.

We were in a group of over 20 people and the service was very good. Our server was quick and accurate."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday. Everything we ordered was tasty. We ordered the Carne pizza as our starter, and it was very yummy. It was a tad spicy but still good. I had the Insalata Arugula salad, and the mango poppyseed dressing was good. I've never had a sweet dressing like that before (in a good way). My boyfriend had the 10oz New York Steak. He said his steak was made exactly how he asked for (cause you know, sometimes the kitchen doesn't always get it right). When I made the reservation, I told them it was my boyfriend's birthday and asked if they could do anything for him. After our meal, they brought out a cheesecake. And very soft and tasty cheesecake!"}
{"text":"3 courses. $55 Date night..really lovely.
Peaceful setting excellent service,very good food..and decaf coffee worthy of a second cup.
Tiramisu amazing!...just the evening we were looking for after a very long day."}
{"text":"First time hear on a visit to Toronto. Restaurant was nice. Our waitress was very good and the food was pretty good too. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I am not a promoter, but seriously guys, CHECK THIS PLACE OUT for Savour Mississauga.  Good value.  

---------------------
Thank you Savour Mississauga and Yelp for helping me discover new/hidden restaurants in my neighbourhood.  I went here as part of the Savour Mississauga event in a Yelp group.  When I walked into the restaurant, I was thinking \"umm..this place is so nice and so formal, do I even belong here with my lack of table manners, my penchant for eating anything and everything no matter how it tastes and my lack of fine dining cuisine knowledge?\"  Well, I still haven't figured that out, but the staff was so friendly so at least they made me feel like my business was wanted.  

Anywho, enough about me, ordered the $35 prix-fixe menu and had:

FOOD: 5/5
-ANTIPASTO AUTUNNO 
The salami was okay, but what really added some amazing flavours was the grilled Polenta and Scarmoza cheese.  The light saltiness of the plate really got my tastebuds going and helped me appreciate what was to come.  Beautiful presentation. 5/5

CAIFORNIA CUT STEAK & SHRIMP (SURF & TURF)
I love my steak and like it medium rare.  This was probably a perfect medium rare, but I did find it slightly salty.  Not a big deal.  What I really appreciated though was the mushroom cream sauce. It added some flavour, without overpowering the natural steak flavour.  I prefer my steaks to have very light flavouring so I can tell the freshness and quality of the meat.   The shrimp was not bad.  Believe it or not though, my fave part  was the potatoes.  I don't know what it was about it, but I could have eaten more of these.  4.5/5


STRAWBERRY CHESSECAKE TART
Sweets are my enemy!!!  Yucky aftertaste, make me fat, give me sugar highs and lows, etc, however this was a dessert that I wouldn't mind befriending.  It wasn't too sweet, but had great flavours.  The tart was nice and crisp, and the icing/whip cream wasn't too heavy either and you could taste each component of the tart.  

AMBIANCE: 5/5 - Amazing place to take a date or any special occasion. 

PRICE: 4/5 - honestly, all of us ordered off the Savour Mississauga prix fixe menu with the exception of one person . He had calamari and liver and they were $11 and $20 respectively for very healthy sized portion and I got the impression from him it was really good.  So really, pricing is probably equivalent to The Keg or slightly cheaper.  

So definitely a hidden gem here and for Savour Mississauga - 5/5.  However, as we were part of a Yelp group, I'm not sure if we were given any special treatment, so the next part is about freebies. 

---------------------
DISCLAIMER: Extra's we may have received because it was a Yelp event as well, while the above is just Savour Mississauga. 

SERVICE: 5/5 - I am sure there service is excellent for everyone else, but I wanted to put it in this section. We were given some freebies:

-Champagne
-Deconstructed panzella salad with mozarella.  Very fresh veggies and interesting mixes of flavours and texture
-Homemade biscotti - I loved this.  I think there was a lemon one and a Nutella one.  I thought the Nutella one was a bit too sweet, but the lemon one was so soft and even tasted good without coffee.  When I have biscotti, I usually have to dip it in coffee to soften the texture, but both of these were very soft and the lemon one had a nice tangy sweetness to it.

{"text":"This restaurant is conveniently located while also in a but of an odd location.

After living in Mississauga for about a year and driving by several times we decided to stop in and we're glad we did. 

We chose from the Taste of Clarkson menu which featured three apps three mains and three desserts to choose from for one price at approximately $37 each.

The grilled goat cheese and beet salad was fresh and expertly presented.  The flank steak was cooked as ordered and surrounded by fresh greens. 

I had the creme brulee which was rich and flavourful (and bigger than expected).

A very good meal at a very good price.  

Service was superb.   Can't wait to go back and try another dish."}
{"text":"Table too small. Bread served was soft and mushy. Not the hard outer crust and soft inside. Minestrone soup is way better at The Olive Garden. Funghi Risotto was loaded with mushrooms but lacked taste. Gelato was quite good and reasonable although my colleague did not care for the pistachio he ordered."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! I love the pizza and pasta, nice ambiance, good service. They are open for lunch during the week and have different sandwiches, salads, etc. One of my favorite restaurants!

Recommendations: Caesar salad, Arugula & Prosciutto pizza, Strozzaperti alla Vodka, Creme Brulee"}
{"text":"Went to Solstice on two occasions, once for a birthday and once for a corporate event within the past 6 months. 

Both times I was impressed with the quality and quantity of the food and the service. 

While it was packed one of the visits and somewhat busy the second, the wait staff was prompt and the food arrived quickly on both trips. 

It was a bit tricky to find as it isn't directly on the street but inside a plaza (Beside the bank)

The food was plentiful and having been to a few Italian restaurants, this rivaled any top location.  I'd recommend the pizzas and desserts and I've had a few bites of my co-worker's pasta which was excellent. The pizzas would be considered gourmet with elaborate toppings, not the typical pepperoni and cheese.

I did not try much of their drinks but they had a well stocked bar and good beer selection available. 

The prices were okay for Mississauga, and I would likely keep this as a special occasion or fancy night out spot when in the area."}
{"text":"I came to Solstice a long time ago for a Yelp event.  The desserts blew my socks off!  I had wanted to return since but I needed an excuse (I live in Markham; Solstice is located in Mississauga).  So happily, my boyfriend had his birthday, and I got to pick where to wine and dine him.  And I picked Solstice.

A step up from many places, the classy services greeted us before the pleasant venue.  The greeter was prompt, courteous and effective.  A waiter promptly asked if we wanted water or other beverages.  Then came the daily specials recommendation, the order taking and so on.  Throughout the meal, the services was smooth, polite and professional.  By the end of the meal, our waiter built rapport with us and laughed at jokes with us.  I would say our waiter was a gem.

We ordered an antipasto appetizer, a rib eye steak with crushed blue cheese and a seafood crepe, a sundae dessert and 2 alcoholic beverages.  The antipasto was good, leaving a clean, crispy feel in my mouth.  The steak was big and extremely tender yet a tad salty to my liking.  It went down easy.  The seafood crepe was creamy, and it was loaded with small shrimps and scallops bits.  True to experience, the sundae was a knockout.  It was big, sweet, loaded with fudge and whipped cream.  The glass was an ice cream cone lookalike.  So cute.  

I have mentioned that the venue is pleasant.  The interior decoration is romantic and upscale casual.  The section where we sat allows privacy.  The noise level is low.  There is another section that is larger and more open, so big groups will find themselves more comfortable there. The overall package makes this restaurant a good choice for special occasions."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and was pleasantly surprised to find a spot like this in Mississauga.  I had a steak sandwich and it was amazing, juicy steak greatly presented. 

The venue could use a bit of renovation but the service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"Great service and an awesome orecchiette make this one of my favourite Italian places around!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner tonight and tried the Kobe Burger and truffle fries. Food was amazing!  You can't go wrong eating here. Have tried other dishes on the menu and everything is delicious. The atmosphere is great. Food is utterly amazing and the staff is so friendly that they make you like you're at home. And it doesn't hurt either that the chef is good looking!"}
{"text":"Last reviewed 3 years ago and still disappointing. 
For those who like their pasta agilo e olio smothered in salt, so much so that that's all you can taste, you will be happy."}
{"text":"Had the most extrutating visit here on Thanksgiving Sunday. Barely anyone in the restaurant but the service was so slow. Food was fine but can't get over how slow the service was. Got there for 6 pm service and didn't leave until 8:50 pm. Honestly every time my wife and I hear that we are invited here, we dread due to the consistently slow and unattentive service."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a group of 10 last night.  Solstice comfortably hosted our group with lots of space for others.  The host and waitress were very welcoming and answered all questions including recommendations.  I had the veal parmigiano,  which was not the best I have had but was pretty good.  I probably will not return to Solstice as it was a fine restaurant but did not provide anything to draw me back."}
{"text":"Food was great, and service was fast. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and got them to surprise me with a cheesecake. We ordered the meat pizza, 10oz. steak, and arugula salad. Everything was great."}
{"text":"Had a great time dining here with my office colleagues after our sales enablement work day. 

Enjoyed the ensalata with fresh mozzarella cheese with sweet fig wrapped in Prosciutto. Sweet and salty just like heaven and earth! I just wished they had served this with virgin olive oil and freshly ground pepper it would have been a home run!

The Orata sea bass was perfectly seasoned and cooked  beautifully! So tender and lots of flavor. The house wine is also notable and quite enjoyable. I should have picked the white wine but just had to try the red. Our server was really polite, attentive and did a wonderful job throughout the evening.

Overall this was a fantastic dinning experience. Our new Boss is the total package -- she picked this place and man she is da bomb in my book!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with my family. It was alright, nothing special. Not busy at all when we went, kind of lackluster."}
