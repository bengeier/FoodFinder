{"text":"Service good Teriyaki chicken plentiful and unremarkable. Combo dish pretty standard fare- generous shrimp portion  I will never understand the extra charge for brown rice at these places...$1.00. Yes I can afford it but really?  White rice is processed so shouldn't that cost more I'll try down the road...this is just average."}
{"text":"We love this place!  It is BYOB (no corkage fee).  It is clean, the service is friendly and fast.  We like the Hunan shrimp, DuDu seafood, triple delight, hot & sour soup,  and egg rolls.  They will prepare your sauces without sugar if you ask them.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to get Chinese food! So delicious! Orange beef is soo good!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food in the area. Nice atmosphere, good food, and a value. If you're feeling adventurous try the hunan two style, the beef is to die for."}
{"text":"Better than I ever expected! Worth trying :D it is rare to find a relatively authentic Chinese cuisine nearby so not a bad choice at all"}
{"text":"I stopped in Hunan Kitchen with a friend last week for lunch.  Though this is local to me I have never been there before.  We got there shortly after noon, and there were maybe one or two other tables enjoying lunch at the same time.    Service was very quick and efficient.  Though a slight language barrier, we didn't wait long to be waited on, was served tea and water without asking and our food came out quickly.  We both ordered off the lunch menu which was very, very reasonably priced.  I went for the shrimp in chili sauce, this came with a cup of soup, or an egg roll, and fried or steamed rice.  I opted for hot and sour soup, and steamed rice.    A very short period later our soups came out.  They were piping hot, so they needed to chill some while we enjoyed those fried crispy delicious chips of some sort that they supply to every table.  The soup, once cooled some was tasty.  A solid 3.  Next came our main courses.  Now my lunch companion got sweet and sour chicken.  I tried it, and it was definitely not for me.  Way too sweet.  My meal was decent; I can't really complain.  I guess if anything I wish it was spicier.  The menu portrayed its spiciness with the inclusion of one animated chili pepper next to the dishes name, but I felt it lacked a great bit.  They do customize this for your liking but I assumed the way they made it would be spicy enough.  At least now I know.    For less than $7.00 a meal with all the add on's this is a worthy lunch stop."}
{"text":"Ordered food here one time. Will not order again. Had to wait double the time I was told on the phone for my pick up order."}
{"text":"Things I like about Hunan Kitchen:  -The food is pretty inexpensive, and almost everything on the menu is a safe bet. They do the same lunch special you'll see at every Chinese restaurant everrrrr (main dish, steamed or fried rice, egg roll or soup), but that doesn't make it a bad thing. -Julie, one of the hostesses, is awesome. At this point, I have probably been going to Hunan for about 10 years, and she knows 1) who I am, 2) where I am living, and 3) other odds and ends about my life. I really like little things like that. -Proximity to the center of Murrysville. Makes meeting other people relatively easy."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place, but things have definitely gone down hill. Had to call 4 times to get my takeout order in (they kept hanging up on me). Should have realized this red flag and called elsewhere...but I put in my order. Went to go pick up and there was not 1 customer in there on a Friday night (another red flag) and I stood there for 10 minutes and there was no one working there. Total ghost town. So I was never able to even pick up my food. A very strange experience. This place used to be good, but no longer."}
{"text":"Chinese restaurants are a dime a dozen around these parts, and often it's tough to really find any that sets itself apart from the others in a meaningful way.  I'd say Hunan Kitchen doesn't really set itself apart, but it's at least a little bit better than most of the alternatives.  Hunan Kitchen became part of my life back when listening to a series of odd noises was the necessary prerequisite to using the internet.  Loyalty to the place came because my family chose it out of the many options available.  They definitely weren't wrong.  I have never experienced poor service in this place, and I've probably been there nearly a hundred times in my life.  The food is a step above, without the price being a step above.  Sure, the food's not something that you'll write home about for years to come, but it's good, reliable Chinese food for a reasonable price.  If you crave Chinese, you could do worse than Hunan Kitchen.  If you're ordering in, I highly recommend the teriyaki dishes.  Yeah, yeah, teriyaki's not Chinese, etc., but they bring it to you on a sizzling platter, and they do a great job at preparing it.    Here or Jade Garden (NOT the \"super buffet,\" the sit-down one!) is where you should go if you're looking for Chinese in Murrysville."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for over 10 years. Food has been quite consistant over that time frame... eat-in or take out. Everyone is friendly and tries hard to please.   Hunan Kitchen is now a BYOB restaurant. That is another added service that makes this place even better.  Service, selection, friendly attitude, BYOB and VERY GOOD FOOD WITH FRESH INGREDIENTS... isn't that what we want in a nice restaurant? This is a family restaurant, not a corporate \"food factory.\"  Visit Hunan Kitchen. I think you will enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"FOOD: Dinner sized portion for lunch prices. I got the Triple Delight and the beef and chicken were nice and tender, as well as the shrimp, which were large. Choice of soup and rice are included with the meal, but egg rolls are a dollar extra. Still, even with the egg roll and leaving a $2 tip my entire meal still came out to under $10. So yes, I would recommend this place.   ATMOSPHERE: The Asian woman who seated and waited on me was very nice. The atmosphere is very average and modest."}
{"text":"Hunan is my favorite chinese restaurant! Always kind, fast, tasty and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered take out (Mixed Veggies) about 6 months ago and they were great! I took my family here last night (day after Christmas). Tsao's Chicken, BBQ Chicken on a stick and mixed veggies, again. All of the food was great, fresh, lots of flavor. Fried rice was not warm enough though. The food was served very slowly. I'll go here again because the food was great. Take out might be best though to keep the frustration factor lower."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the quality of food. Giving 3 star just for their good service. Wouldn't recommend..."}
