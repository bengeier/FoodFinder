{"text":"Sadly, Ricos Tacos is no more.

I was excited by the reviews, but when we arrived to eat Ricos Tacos is now \"Traditional Taco\". When Rico left, he apparently took all the flavor with him.

I had barbacoa and carnitas tacos and they were very bland. The barbacoa had at least the hint of chili powder but the carnitas tasted like I was eating cardboard with onions on top. I took one bite and left the rest.

Don't bother even going. At approximately $3 a taco, it wasn't worth it."}

{"text":"Take out taco lunch in the north-central part of the city today, and my experience pretty much matches up with what the other reviews noted. The Spartan in anterior has been spruced up with some orange paint, one small table with benches, and a tall counter along the window. The menu, written on a white board at the back, offered tacos, burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas, sopes, tostadas, and chips and guacamole.

I had the special number one, two tacos and the quesadilla. Quesadilla was fairly bland and tasted primarily of mayo, though it does say mayo in the description on the menu, so that shouldn't come as a surprise. The included small contatiner of thin green salsa pepped it up a bit. Barbacoa taco was okay, and served traditionally with lime, cilantro, diced onion and a little bit of tomato. The Al Pastor on the other hand was quite good. Tangy slow cooked pork and a few chunks of pineapple with the cilantro and onion, very nice.

Tortillas were, like one of the other reviews noted, not super fresh. They weren't bad, just a little tougher around the edges. Value was OK, but given the spartan set-up I'd like to see either more filling in each taco, or the price ($3.00) dropped down to $2.50 a piece before I'd consider myself a fan. 

That said, if I lived near here, I would probably end up eating here a lot. As it is halfway across town for me, I don't think I'll make any special trips, but would definitely stop in again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly, well priced, and best of all very tasty! Will be even better when they get their liquor license and you can get Mexican beers here."}
{"text":"Pretty Stellar Simple Tacos

Came in here for a quick take out lunch. Under the suggestion of the owner (Whom I assumed was Rico) went with the 3x Taco special of Carne Ssada. For just 3 tacos loaded,  it was surprisingly filling. (Two tortillas per taco). Nice fresh homemade hot sauce.  

Friendly simple service. Will definitely be back for a quick bite."}
