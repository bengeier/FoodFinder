{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had in Montreal! So crispy and cheesy and delicious!! I would definitely recommend this place all year around. Beautiful setting inside, I sat upstairs and it felt very cozy. The whole experience was amazing!"}
{"text":"Très bonne pizzeria. Le service est assez efficace et courtois. Les pizzas sont délicieuses et variés. Les autres plats ne sont pas mal non plus, avec des spéciaux qui changent régulièrement. L'un de mes restaurants préférés de Montréal. Petit bémol : ils ne prennent pas les reservations."}
{"text":"I don't go out for fancy pizza that often and don't eat in TMR that often either

Not this night,  took the opportunity to finally try out this place just for the atmosphere on the terrace by the centre of the \"city garden\".

The menu is limited,  we took an app with warm goat cheese in olive oil,  very tasty but it was one large spoonful for $7. And it's served with crusty generic bread.

A plate of pasta carbonara and Americano pizza was much better ($15 each). A small salad would have been appreciated but none comes with their dish.

The pasta portion is enough for 2, the pizza was very tasty (we saw the wood oven inside) with generous toppings.

The service was very good once it got going, since we were not even acknowledged for 10 minutes while waiting to be seated. Just a nod and a smile would have been nice. I understand they can be busy, but they almost lost paying customers."}
{"text":"Perfect for a nice lunch on a terasse! They have great pizza's and nice sangria. The service is also very good! We had the spicy sausage that was good and we shared an all dressed pizza with a four cheese pizza that had apples and we added prosciutto on top. It was really delicious. We had chocolate fondant and tiramisu for desert it was superb! I really love this place and we are definitely coming back!
P.S. We went on a Saturday around 4 and at about 5:30 it was packed people were waiting for tables."}
{"text":"As good as it gets pizza is hard to come by but i think I've found something close to it. I came here once with my best friend one time and i never forgot it. The thin crust pizza's and the verity of appetizers are great and the location is perfect. 
I remember when i was small, this location used to be a train station but closed because i guess it was too old. I don't know who thought about putting a pizza place in here but bless them!
I took upon myself to take my mom and show her this gem and she enjoyed it too! i took the bruschetta type appetizer with a sausage and onion pizza! The reason why it taste this good is because they have a wood burning oven which i think is the basic necessity for a pizza. Our waitress was very nice and offered us a bottle of wine (which was extra) and we glady said yes because why not! 
After that fest, we had the best part of a meal... DESSERT. 
I took the oven baked apple pie (do it!) and my mom order the cheesecake.
My dessert was better of course but it was the perfect conclusion to the great meal i had.

SO my recommendation is go. have a great time with friends of family and let loose.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Its a pretty straight forward restaurant wine &pizza. Pizza was good , nice crust not too thin not too heavy just right! but nothing from this place stood out besides their interesting location which makes you feel like in a secret spot or on a hide out! Good for a secluded date. Lol. Simple and good service. I know theres a second floor but havent seen it yet. I will be going there for their terrace on a sunny day however ."}
{"text":"Great little place, great SERVICE, good pizza!!! Thin style pizza, good and fresh menu!
Pizza is good and consistent every time I go. The service was stellar all the times and that's a big reason why I keep coming back.
The first 2 times with 2 different waitresses and last time with the manager when the place was almost empty, late at night. He even allowed us to stay longer without kicking us until he had to, which was way past official closing time.
The atmosphere is also much better during the summer when the terrace is open and people are enjoying their meal... great for a first date.
For lunch is always full and they don't accept reservation.
Price is very reasonable, but when you receive good service I'm always willing to pay a little more."}
{"text":"Cet endroit est cher à mon coeur pour plusieurs raisons sentimentales et, même si vous ne partagez pas mes souvenirs, j'espère teinter mon avis d'assez de points positifs pour que vous ayez envie d'aller y créer les vôtres.

La pizzeria ne servirait pas à manger que j'irais quand même. L'emplacement est super! Le rond-point de Ville Mont-Royal est beau à toutes les saisons, mais la floraison de la roseraie en face est particulièrement remarquable. L'intérieur est petit mais offre plusieurs ambiances pour toutes les occasions: des groupes ou des familles au deuxième ou sur la terrasse extérieure et des coins pour les jasettes en amoureux ou en duo avec un ami! Suite à leurs dernières rénovations, un espace de terrasse intérieure/solarium est venu rendre le paysage disponible en toutes saisons. Finalement, j'adore l'extrême proximité avec la gare du train de banlieue, ses passages sont amusants et ses usagers rendent l'intersection très intéressante à regarder. 

Côté bouffe, j'étais une fan de la première heure de leur excellente pizza aux sept légumes, qui n'est plus sur le menu. Heureusement, il y en a une autre que je vous recommande avec enthousiasme, au nom évocateur \"quatre fromages et pommes\". Il fût un temps où je vivais en face et même après l'avoir prise pour emporter des dizaines de fois, je ne m'en suis jamais lassée. Acceptez la petite huile épicée, elle est excellente sur les croutes! La pizza est mince mais grande et bien garnie, alors à moins de la partager, je ne vous conseille pas d'y ajouter une entrée. Cependant, si vous partagez, la salade de roquette est excellente mais un peu chère, et les fazzoletti au beurre avec de la sauge sont simples mais succulents. 

Côté service, les serveurs travaillent tous bien, seulement ils sont victimes du succès de l'endroit. Je n'ai jamais été négligée longtemps mais ça peut être un peu long avant de se faire asseoir et servir. Pas le choix de profiter du bon temps sans stresser!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area. I enjoy everything on their menue. They dont do delivery,  but if you dont mind picking up, it's an above average pizza."}
