{"text":"Agree with Jennifer ... Little bit disappointed!  Ramen was over cooked; Chasu was too fat, no BBQ taste, look like Chinese style fat pork; Soup too salty; Fried noodle too salty; $2 for a California roll seem over a day, very dry; Order come very slow! Only 1 waitress here, so when we add more order seem no one help!!"}
{"text":"I tried their spicy garlic ramen and i can say i literally got robbed 11 bucks.. it sucks. The soup is water with hot sauce and the pork well, \"pork\" is literally a month old, and they gave me a pound of beans sprout but 3 strands of ramen. I honestly think you should go to a supermarket and buy those instant noodles and itll not only taste better but save yourself the 11 bucks."}
{"text":"Theres no way this place is a two star kinda restaurant! Its a solid 4. Im giving it a 5 to average it out. The spicy salmon is great. The tempura is very flavourful. The service is  not spectacular, but certainly not dismal. Average service. But the food is actually quite good."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. It took us 10 minutes just to get someone to order then when we ordered the waiter forgot our plates and drinks. I'll say the sushi was good but there are definitely better places in the area."}
{"text":"2.5 I was hoping this place would be good but mediocre at best. Sorry.  My boyfriend thinks the ramen is ok. I think it's so so. Sushi is so so too.  If you do takeout, pay in cash, save the taxes.  I find that the take out sushi trays lack variety though.   Free wifi. Ask the serve for the password."}
{"text":"I've been here to eat a few times now for sushi and ramen noodle dishes. Everything has been very tasty and fresh. My favourite has been the spicy garlic ramen soup and bento boxes. The atmosphere is very nice and clean. The servers have also been very nice, offering me tea while waiting for a takeout order. I will defiantly eat here again."}
{"text":"Takoyaki balls were supposed to come in 4( small order) or 8 ( large order).  We ordered a small one and 5 half balls came. Not exactly the four full ones we had in mind.  My friends ramens were way too spicy and garlicky kind of tasted like bad Kim chi.  My vegetarian one was bland and over-cooked.   Our server was full of attitude and inattentive.    Me no come back"}
{"text":"* The place: great location, nice decorated and very clean  * Staff: very attentive and fast  * FOOD: well.. We ordered Sushi and Ramen (exactly what their sign say. So Sushi 7/10; fish very fresh, but so so so thin, i barely tasted the fish unless i take it out of the roll. Wonder how thick would have been the sashimi. RAMEN, disappointed, the broth wasn't that tasty as i was expected, the pork is different from a \"ramen\" world and the noodle didn't have a lot of taste. Certainly they need more improvement in this. Or go downtown and try some of the ramens there.  The location is excellent for a sushi treat hang out and have fun... Not ramen night."}
{"text":"Tough to justify when there are so many outstanding restaurants that are literally a \"stone's throw\" away.  I had my usual reference point, a sushi combination.  My first criteria is that the nori (seaweed wrap) must not be soggy and chewy, but crisp enough to snap when bitten.  The rolls didn't pass that test.  The sushi had fish in a decent proportion in contrast to the rice, but the fish didn't look or taste like the freshest I have had in the area for the same price. The miso soup was a touch bland.  My lunch guest had lived in Korea for an extended period.  She found the food acceptable, but not enough to knock your socks off.  Visually, this restaurant is a nice place-its funny how some of the best foods come from the diveiest looking surroundings.  I think they are trying to go for an upscale experience, and when the food catches up to the surrounding, I expect this will be a winner.  I'll wait a little longer and give it another go.  I have faith that they can crank it up."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this restaurant. Our entire order was a disaster. We ordered a number of different sushi and rolls. The sushi was not fresh, to the point my husband had to spit it out. Even our rolls (without any fish) tasted somehow fishy. The biggest disappointment was the chicken terriyaki; the chicken breast had the taste and texture of boiled chicken that was precooked and stored too long in the fridge. Oh wait - I just found some clear plastic in the spider roll I was eating. This is beyond unacceptable. I can't believe this restaurant is still in business. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"The first time I tried  this place, I was quite pleased with the ramen I ordered.  The chasu pork was tender and has that smoked taste to it,  the noodles were fresh and the broth has the right spice.  The second time I went for the same ramen,  the pork did not have the Smokey taste and wasn't as tender.  Broth was still good,  but the veggies in the soup included the hard parts of the cabbage,  the part I throw away when cooking because it's tough.  All the while I was eating,  I thought to myself,  maybe the chef made a mistake of dumping it into the soup instead of discarding it?  Places that do not have consistency of the quality of food is a big turn off for me.  I'd be very skeptical to try it again. The thing I noticed is that,  the first visit,  was around 3pm, when there are hardly any customers,  and the second time,  it was dinner time and the restaurant was a bit busy.  Oh well,  there are other places I can try to satisfy my ramen cravings."}
{"text":"Great location, except can't see the interior from Hwy 7 which can attract more crowd. Decent restaurant,  clean, modern looking; staff are attentive and quick to take and deliver order. Sushi  are great,  fresh enough. Prices average, acceptable.   Ramen fair, soup could have been hotter to soften the noodles.  Upgraded $2 extra, got a california roll with 6 pcs (other roll choices available).  Worth a go. Will come back."}
{"text":"I went late afternoon when the restaurant was all dark and staff were having lunch.  I asked I'd they had ramen and uni. They did.  Good ramen selection.  They expanded that they don't have live shelled uni, but they can provide the regular sashimi and sushi with uni. Server was very nice and sweet,  and even asked me where I found freshly shelled uni in the area.  Fresh uni sashimi with interesting onion sauce.  The ramen was a bit disappointing, tasted liked Chinese soup,  definitely not miso with butter. Chasu pieces were small.  The egg was not flowy/juicy.  The noodles were not cooked well,  so there were a few globs of sloth in my mouth.  Music was too loud for such a quiet place with only two customers.  They have an area where they can use curtains to section out for a group,  but there is no separate room, so expect your excitement to be heard.  I had left my miso butter corn chasu ramen sitting for a while, writing away on my yelp review, when the waitress came to ask whether there was anything wrong with the noodles.   I told her about what I thought,  and she offered to give me a new one in another flavour - a sea salt one. It was not as animal-greast as the first one,  but still tasted very much like Chinese soup.  I appreciate the service of the waitress though."}
{"text":"As a regular sushi fan and a vivid raman eater, its a good choice, but i haven't tried the other items on the menu. Service was ok, as there was not much people there. I am still wondering if this place would survive or makes any money at all during dinner time. It was once used to be a Thai place if i remember about 5 years ago."}
{"text":"The diablo roll here is pretty legit and I really enjoyed the okonomiyaki.  However I asked for my ramen without the pork and sent it back when it came with it.  They then scooped it out and sent the same bowl out.   I complained and they redid it but I was really disappointed that they would do this. They spoke to each other in Korean and I could understand them telling each other that the waitress was instructed to just scoop it out.   Will probably come back but will check my food over before i eat anything here again."}
{"text":"The food at Sushi Maru and Ramen was just disappointing.   This location used to be Sushi Tei and when Sushi M & R moved in, they kept all the decoration and furniture with no much changes aside from the menu. The menu is quite standard with the usual sushi/sashimi/rolls, teriyaki and some Korean/Japanese items. There are also quite a few Ramen to choose from. On this cold windy night I decide to have as recommended by the waitress.  Spicy Tantan Kimchi Maru ($11.50) - The broth is really one dimensional with not much of taste.. not spicy at all even after my special request - The noodle itself was soggy and over cooked without any bite, FAIL - Chasu was brutally fat.. with no bbq flavour. I just could not eat that after one bite  Dinner Bento ($16.99) with Chicken Teriyaki - We request for brown rice instead of regular rice for the sushi when ordering which the waitress said it cost extra $1 for the 5 piece of sushi.. Then she came back and say it will be 50 cents extra because it cost 50 cents per 2 piece, and since we have 5, that cost $1.50?! So she came back and argue with me for 50 cents? I should tell her it is only 25 cents extra... - Sashimi was so so, the lone piece of tuna has a funny looking colour, the rest were all salmon - Sushi is good bite size piece but my advice is don't get the brown rice, since no one is really ordering that, the rice was dry and hard... - The rolls was large but the fish inside the roll was mushy  Sushi Tei didn't last in this location with better food. I doubt Sushi Maru and Ramen would be around for too long if they don't improvement on their food quality.   With so many Sushi Restaurants in the area.. I would suggest a PASS!"}
