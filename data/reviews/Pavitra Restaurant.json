{"text":"*EDIT: I think they are now closed (as of summer 2013).  There seems to be a sushi restaurant there now.*  We have gone to Pavitra twice, and will be going back.  We've been looking for a good Indian place close to us ever since coming back from India earlier in the year, and have tried several but this is the top of the list right now.    The host/waiter has been exceptionally friendly both visits.  Maybe because we tend to eat early and mostly have the place to ourselves.  We've had the butter chicken, the chicken tikka, chicken korma, and chicken madras.  Apparently we like chicken.  All of them were tasty, with I think the tikka and the korma possibly standing out.  the samosas were good to start, as was the vegetable pakora.  Prices are reasonable, especially when using on online coupon, and we always have leftovers to bring home when we order 2 dishes.  Not sure you can really blame them for having cold takeout when you get it home, maybe get there early so you can pick it up when it comes out?  If you're in the area, Pavitra is definitely worth a visit, and we haven't found anything that we like better nearby."}
{"text":"I never really was into Indian food until recently. A sudden craving made my sister and I drive here (which is only five minutes away from my house) and ordered take out. Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, Vegetable Pakora, Aloo Gobi and 4 Naan breads. $50. Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I'm pretty sure there are better indian restaurants out there but for now, and with the fact that this place is literally five minutes away, i will definitely go back for more. Maybe some Tandoori Chicken next time? or Chicken Vindaloo!   PS. as soon as you walk in their restaurant, all you get is the great smells of food cooking from their kitchen. I can't wait to order again from here!"}
{"text":"Some of the food we got here was excellent but some was sub-par. The lentils,  chicken masala, and naan were all very delicious. However, the rice was not fluffy, and the lassi had a nasty sulphur smell and taste. I would not go out of my way to avoid this place, but I also will try other nearby places before I come here again.  Overall, the menu and website are pretty good, and the service was good too."}
{"text":"I came here Friday night for a private party.  The hosts had booked the whole restaurant and set up a buffett.  1. The First Course (Appz)  There was Veggie Pakoras, Hariyali Chicken, and Chaat from what I remember.  The Hariyali Chicken was amazing. Soo good.  And the chaat was awesome too!!  2. The Dinner.  They had the pretty standard fare of items  a) Baigan Bharta - this was my favourite item from the buffett. Go figure I love the veggie item.  b) The malai kofta - I've never really had it before, so I tried it out. I wasn't a fan.  c) The Rice was a little dry.  d) THe naan though it wasnt as fresh as it was cut up and put on the buffett, was still awesome.  e) There were a few other curries that I can't recall. They weren't anything special.   Note : They had put the sauces and chutneys at the beginning of the buffett, so a lot of people had little puddles of it on their plates. It would've been more effective to put it on the other end.   3. The Dessert   They had   1. Gulab Jamun  - i didn't try it as I'm not a fan.  2. Frozen Rasmalai - OMG THIS WAS AMAZING. Couldn't get a second round of this as it got over pretty fast.   3. Mango Kulfi - It was really good as well. Not as good as the Frozen Rasmalai. Wow.      All in all, it was okay. Not the best restaurant I've been too."}
{"text":"I haven't verified this yet but Pavitra may have gone out of business.  I just received a flyer to try out a new AYCE Japanese-Chinese-Thai restaurant at the same address.  Apparently the new restaurant is called OMI (647-748-4352).  If someone else gets a chance to check this out, be sure to let me know!"}
{"text":"I am so impressed with this new restaurant.  Our family visited last weekend.  The service have prompt and friendly, the garlic naan was warm crispy and delicious and the lamb masala was wonderful.  We shall be back."}
