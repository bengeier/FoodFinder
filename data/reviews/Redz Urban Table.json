{"text":"Cute little cafe located in the Concorde building with a nice patio option and plenty of seating. Hidden little gem with a relaxing fountain, pond, ducks and baby turtles to watch. Best home brewed coffee and a great menu variety from simple essentials to urban-curiosity. I ordered an everything bagel ham, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich and coffee. The sand which was nicely packed and made even better with the olive oil vinegar dressing. Customer service was very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I work in a office as the same building as Redz, when they opened I had very high hopes for the cafe. Before, the cafe use to be under a different management. Now that Redz moved in, the renovations were amazing, very chic look.   Very optimistic about the grand opening, my first meal I ordered was a grilled cheese. I mean nothing can go wrong with a grilled cheese. But upon receiving my order, I was very disappointed of the quantity & quality of the grilled cheese. There was burnt, black crust bits all over my sandwich, I didn't send it back simply because I had too much to do in my work load. It came with a chili soup which was very salty. I only ate about a quarter of my sandwich before throwing it away. Not only was the sandwich and soup were a disappointment, but the price of the whole meal. It wasn't worth more than $10.  I thought I was done with the cafe but I have to admit I ended up going back for different treats. The prices are outrageous!   I decided to try a Cobb salad one day and I fell in love with it. I ordered it about 3 different times. The fourth time they had made it fresh for me. High hopes turned right around. As I was only a quarter of the way of my salad, I noticed the bottom of my box was full of water. I once again threw the salad out.   This place is a hit or miss, prices are too high. I will not be ordering a grilled cheese or salad again."}
{"text":"Food is decent, nice courtyard. The employees are all very friendly, except Helen, Helen is a terrible human being."}
{"text":"The short: Good food in a work-through-lunch pinch, but call your order ahead; prices standard but daily specials are a good value, especially for breakfast (all day!); clean and easy to find a seat and move tables together; I always defy my diet if there are consistently yummy chocolate chip and walnut cookies in their in-house-baked treat trays.  The long: On the northeast block of 44th St. and Thomas, the second building north of the Wells Fargo on the north end, first floor of the domed office building. Standard sandwich stop downstairs, not the kind of place I'd drive to, though you can pick in the office building's few visitors parking spots or in the parking structure.   There can be a wait during lunch when ordering at the counter and a longer wait while waiting for food, so I recommend calling your order in unless you just want to snag a prepared salad from their grab-n-go case. The staff is nice and as efficient as possible. The daily breakfast and lunch specials written on the whiteboard beside the door are always worth a quick glance, and I ordered the chicken pita with side special along with a giant chocolate chip and walnut cookie, all for eight bucks and change. The pita was good--chicken well cooked and seasoned, veggies fresh, pita soft, potato salad standard, cookie still a favorite. Some lunch breaks, I just order a breakfast burrito, which they toast in their panini iron--they'll toast the bread for any sandwich your order, too. Bonus for having some grab n go items like fruit, hard-boiled eggs, candy, gum, ice cream bars, coffee, and a drink case/fountain drinks. Another bonus for outdoor seating when the weather is nice--I sit on one of the building's benches and tease the giant koi fish with some crumbs.  I come here at least once a month, and the food is consistently good, if no frills--good enough to convince me I don't need to walk across the street for a sandwich when this is right next door to my building. They messed an order up once and were very communicative and apologetic and made fixing it a priority--I'd feel comfortable talking to them about any issues. I'm glad to have the place here for a dependable work lunch."}
{"text":"So cute!  this place has everything and is super convenient to just grab and go. Priced very affordable too!"}
{"text":"For the price, you cannot beat the quality of the food and the speed of the service.  Not much for atmosphere, but who cares if I'm in a hurry.  Friendly staff too.  They've even started doing barbecue themed lunches.  Even if you don't work in the building, it would be worth it to stop by for lunch."}
