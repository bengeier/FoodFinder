{"text":"This place sucked. $20+ beers and rude service. Would have paid less for drinks at the strip club next door and left way more satisfied."}
{"text":"Ok, so I get that the food and beer are tasty and I love the idea of sharing plates. However, the price of these small plates is a bit outrageous for what you actually get. Between 5 of us we had to order 4 plates of wings, 3 souvlaki plates, 2 gnocchi, eggplant, 2 orders of rapini, mushroom salad, 2 orders of the salbitxada, 2 pasta Fagioli, scallop plate, and I think a couple more... and a few of us were still hungry. We are also small people. I just think that spending over $40 a person on food would result in feeling full. Not to mention that the beer is severely over priced. A bottle of craft beer for $16-$24 is beyond ridiculous. Looking up some of the beers on the LCBO website and seeing them go for $3.50 was disheartening. 

I ordered a couple glasses of red wine (which was actually really good) but when I ordered my 2nd glass the waiter brought the bottle to the table and free poured it...even though I hadn't finished drinking my first glass. At first I thought \"oh good, if he's free pouring on top of my unfinished wine, he might pour a little extra\". Nope. I'm pretty sure I was poured up to the amount that my first glass was at...with the added extra wine that I hadn't finished, so ultimately a pretty tiny pour. 

After being there for an hour and a half and having 3 glasses of wine, I was obviously quite thirsty and asked for a glass of water to which the waiter responded with \"Water?!\" as if to say \"Why aren't you ordering more wine?\". I wasn't very impressed with that. Dude, I need water. Don't try to make me feel stupid for being human.

I do have to say that all the food tasted very good. Good job to the kitchen. But overall I think this place is overpriced and left me wanting more, even after spending over $100 per person."}
{"text":"Very flavourful food. Chef knows what is he doing. Combination of the ingredients are very well executed. Love the vibe in this place."}
{"text":"Wow merci pour le service en fran√ßais the plate was amazing and the waiter so cute!!! Try the gnocchi"}
{"text":"Nicest staff in the city. The food is packed full of flavour, perfectly cooked and the menu is unique."}
{"text":"Youre probably going to miss the entrance due to its lack of signage, but after talking with the owner (one of the nicest and more approachable individuals I have ever met) you understand it is all a part of the appeal of the Four Seven. 

The food rotates, frequently, so there is no real point writing a review about what you eat specifically. That being said, everything I ate on the menu was delicious, the pork souvlaki was unreal. 

The cocktails were all custom and well explained by Dimitri, and really tailored the drinking experience to the individual. 

Finally the music, back to back amazingness. While eating and drinking there I think I listened to the entire MSTRKRFT anthology. Definitely a place I would return to, and keep returning just to see what is on the menu next."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The food is always delicious, the atmosphere is great, and the staff are friendly. Our favourite place to go for a beer and, mostly, for dinner/snacks."}
{"text":"On yelp it states they were open yesterday Sunday from 6pm - 2am.  Took an uber there to find out they are closed. Perhaps thay have new business hours. I would recommend updating them.  Thanks I have not had the opportunity yet to try this place but wanted to last night."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Wandered in with my friend and the server was super-welcoming and informative.  The food is beyond delicious and is easily adaptable to all tastes and allergies.  Brilliant move on the restaurant's part!  Also brilliant: we stuffed ourselves and each had a pint - the bill was $44 with tax!

Nice beer selection and THANK YOU for not pretending that Beau's is a lager.  For that reason alone, I will be back.  :)"}
{"text":"Most delicious gnocchi and panna cotta. Plus, the friendliest staff, thanks for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This place is so great. The food is perfect, the beer is always new and exciting, and the service is the best I've had in a bar in Toronto. Get the souvlaki, the socca, and try a cool bottle of something you've never heard of - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I bet I already reviewed this place, but man o man, this is the place to have your dinner tonight, or tomorrow, I don't care which. 

The absolute best Balkan-pan-mediterranean dive bar with chicken's wings. 

Thoughtful selection of beers.

I am so mad at you for not eating there tonight, but the truth is: when you eat there you will be even more mad at yourself for not having eaten there on many nights. Many nights you spent listening to some bored server drone on about the specials, or worse yet, never show up at your table at all, when you could have been chowing down on Socca and Kashkaval (fried cheese). You'll never get those nights back, but like Saul on the road to Damascus, you just gotta change your ways. Right?"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday evening. The bartender was AWESOME because he's such a beer nerd and it was so nice to chat with other beer nerds. I knock off a star because there are patrons who frequent there that may have some personalities that won't play well with others. There was a grumpy dude at the bar reading a novel who got all riled up because I stood directly behind him to discuss the menu with my drinking partner. He was all miffed and whipped off his glasses like \"wtf man, I'm reading\". First of all, why would you read at a dimly lit bar, and secondly, it's a bar, so there will be conversation and noise, so you don't get to be upset over that. Read somewhere else, buddy. Boo hoo. Poo poo."}
{"text":"Love it here as the food is fresh, delicious and they serve late into the night. Chill spot with unique beverages and awesome authentic food. Intimate and comfy with a great vibe. The best for meet ups, dates and fun nights out or late night eats"}
{"text":"Was walking around Bloordale, checking out some places and came here for some food. I dine out a lot and so am familiar with how expensive good food is in Toronto. This place was so refreshing because it was really good and not expensive at all. Ordered a bunch of food to share including
squid with a delicious almond sauce 
socca (this really fluffy chickpea pancake) with lamb and parsley on top (so good!) caponata (eggplant relish-like dish)
deep fried cheese (whaaaaaat)
Was stuffed and our bill with a drink was 60 bucks.
They have lot sof drinks options, including wine, though I am more of a beer drinker. They have interesting bottles and a good draft list, so coming just for a few drinks I assume would be fun too. The server was really nice and laid-back. Definitely recommend for dinner or a casual bar snack."}
{"text":"Amazing beer and food. This place is by far the best spot for late night food. 
Bartender was so friendly. They had run out of some of the menu items and he offered us a complimentary Greek salad that was so delicious I just can't wait to go back and try all the other stuff. 
Best beers in the hood!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great unpretentious neighbourhood bar with quality food and fine drinks."}
{"text":"Love this place, the menu absolutely blew me away. Everything on the menu is insanely tasty, I especially recommend the squid. You do have to be prepared to order a few dishes per person though since the portions are small but it's so worth it and you get to taste lots of things."}
{"text":"Super impressed with the quality of the food at this little late-night resto-bar...the ricotta gnocchi with beef ragu was outstanding. We also ordered wings, which that night were prepared with a spicy salsa verde. They were also top notch.

My only criticism is the hint of 'tude I received when I asked the waiter (possibly the owner?) about one of the beers on the menu. \"Is it good?\" I innocently inquired, to which he replied \"I wouldn't stock it if it wasn't good.\" Well okay then, soooorry :) (PS this particular beer, called Mr Pink, was indeed quite good....but still!)"}
{"text":"The place had an interesting vibe. The ambiance was excellent and quite romantic/intimate. It was dark with candles, a beautiful colourful art adorned the wall. Music was good, but at times a bit loud. 

I was very impressed by the quality of the food, I am not sure I expected the food to be as good as it was. 

We ordered the fried cheese, squid and wings. 

The fried cheese was the perfect start. It was light and gooey from the inside but a little crispy on the outside. The tomatoes were flavourful,  Italian flavours. The tomatoes added freshness. 

The wings were flavoured with a mix of buffalo sauce and asian flavours. It was a good balance between classic wings versus unique wings. They were a touch cold, and did not look as flavourful as they turned out. 

The squid was also excellent. It similarly had an asian twist, and also incorporated nuts perfectly. 

There was an excellent selection of beer."}
{"text":"I came here last night with a couple of friends and we absolutely LOVED this place. The West Avenue cider was the tastiest sparkly apple juice I have ever had; perfect balance of dry and sweet. Their Manhattans are also tasty as sin and the maraschino cherries ain't that No Name brand nonsense. And the souvlaki OMFG 

Plus, the bartenders are total babes."}
{"text":"This place was decent. Service was great, and super friendly. It was dead when we came in at 6:30 but slowly started to fill up as we were there. 

We picked beers which were cold and good. The eggplant Socca was nothing special, the Salbitxada (squid) was delicious. It was perfectly cooked...ORDER THIS! The souvlaki was also delicious. It came on a pita with tzaziki and it was delicious and well seasoned and cooked. 

Atmosphere is underwhelming. It's just a small dive bar. This place is definitely for the beer connoisseurs of the world :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! 

Initially, the menu doesn't look like much, and seems like a random assortment of international things.. but oh man, everything is insanely tasty.

The squid version of the peanut sauce dish (already forgot the name) was just excellent. The squid was char-grilled and then coated in the sauce. The gyro is super flavorful. The kashcaval cheese was super tasty. There was also this lamb sausage type thing with cheese inside it. Also stupid good.

They also have some pretty unique brews. Some beers I haven't seen around at many other places (can;t remember the names). A really nice hoppy cider called Revel (I loved it and I don't even like cider!)

Only thing I was bummed about was them not yet having desserts! But the server said they are working on it :)

I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Everything's so delicious I want one of everything on the menu....with the exception of the cevapi, have 2 of those!"}
{"text":"The food is constantly changing, popular food stays on the menu longer, and the food is absolutely delicious. Toss in a selection of rare craft brews and you have an awesome experience. The food is tapas style if that is a game changer for anyone."}
{"text":"Really friendly server, Nice atmosphere, decent drink selection, and food. I would suggest having a few drinks before ordering any snacks because everything my friends and I ordered was small (not sharable) and drenched in oil and salt."}
{"text":"An unassuming dive bar that happens to have a small but yummy selection of tapas and a decent selection of beer (I'm not a beer girl but i enjoyed the pale ale). We liked most of what we ordered! The gnocchi was creamy and yummy, white fish and leeks were good, chicken wings are good if you like very spicy food. Beware: the squid is absolutely delicious and tender but it's very brazenly covered in roasted (?) garlic that you'll be tasting for hours. It's a small joint that plays really good old hip hop."}
