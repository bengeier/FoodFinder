{"text":"Love this place food is great service is great and music is great. Brenda was a really nice person."}
{"text":"We've been coming here with my family for a few years now and I'm ashamed to say I've never written a review. Rudy, the owner/operator, and his amazing staff have never let us down. He's an ex-New Yorker like we are, and appreciates the east coast diner culture from back in the day, and it really shows in his attention to detail and customer service. They treat us like family and shower my kid with attention. The food is high quality, portioned well, and always cooked properly. I know Rudy takes great pride in sourcing good ingredients, and it shows. Running a diner is no small feat, keeping up with a large menu is a challenge these days for a small business owner. 

We come about once a month on average, usually for breakfast and the food is great. Big, fluffy, never over cooked omelettes are my thing.  They never have a problem with substitutions, and will work with you on making your meal right. They even let my wife substitute sausage links or bacon for toast and potatoes to fit her low carb style with NO UPCHARGE!!!  My daughter loves their French toast and I must admit, it's pretty good, plus the staff treats her like a princess. Seattle's best brand coffee is brewed fresh constantly, always piping hot, strong, and never stale. This is 'our' diner, a very special place in the NY/NJ ethos. 

Bottom line pros: Tasty standard east coast style diner fare, big portions, family friendly atmosphere. Best breakfasts: omelettes and chicken fried steak. 
Lunch menu is solid too. Great burgers and sandwiches and perfect steak fries. 

Bottom line cons: Not a fan of the pancake batter, it's got too much vanilla flavor and isn't dense enough.  That's really it!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is excellent. Yelp wants my review to be longer so I'll keep typing but really you should just go here it was great food and great service in a really cool atmosphere. We got there after their breakfast hours and they made us breakfast anyways. They have little potatoe cubes that were delightfully crispy on the outside."}
{"text":"This place is off the beaten path in Vegas but it is worth a visit if you want good priced food that tastes good. The staff is friendly and will make things to order this is my second time back in 3 days."}
{"text":"I have been in Vegas for 10 years, and was looking for a decent place for breakfast. This place  is the most fantastic spot of breakfast and diner food! I suggest the chicken fried steak. The food is soo good"}
{"text":"Amazing service at a neighborhood joint--it's clear that this establishment is regularly frequented by people who enjoy both the food and the ambiance. 

Growing up in NJ, I am pickier about diners than others, but this place had it all: strong bottomless coffee, a good toast selection, and ketchup to go with my softly scrambled eggs. 

Would definitely recommend stopping here--it's on your way to Death Valley from Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"When come here often.  The food is great and lunch is outstanding!  We stay at the MCR next door.  Current Management has completed 4 years of service.  Just a good place to relax enjoy the food and company."}
{"text":"I definitely won't be coming back here. I have never felt so uncomfortable my entire life. I was here with my kids, and she asked if it was seperate checks. It was a very unwelcoming situation and it made me and my kids feel so uncomfortable. There was a lady standing at the barstools staring at us the entire time we were there. It was the worst feeling."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Clean, reasonable prices, friendly family like service, and good portion sizes.  I will probably return later this week!  

I had the 2 eggs scrambled, 2 pancakes, and 2 sausages breakfast, my hubby had the same with 2 bacon, and we both had small OJs.  Everything came out perfect, the sausage tasted homemade, it had some spicy red pepper, which I liked.  The bill was less than $21 for two people.  It definitely is a hidden gem of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here when I'm too lazy to make breakfast because this is so close to my house. Like a minute drive or two. This cute and cozy diner got the friendliest servers. They make you feel at home. I love the chicken fried steak and the salads are huge! The decor reminds you of the 50's diner, just like in the movies! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  The food is very fresh and tasty.  The coffee is good as well.  The service is very good.  It gives me a good feeling coming here with the good old days of the diner."}
{"text":"The best bargain you will ever find in Vegas!  Absolutely Fresh Food no waiting line .  Great  multi-grain pancakes (big!) and you want the sausage which tastes slightly better than the patties. Absolutely HUGE ham steak. A real monster and likely you will take some home.
 ZERO discrepancies in last health inspection.  5th year of owner small business.
The restrooms sparkle due to Kelly's diligence and she's a great waitress too!!"}
{"text":"Cool little hideaway. Great food, clean and friendly. Prices were reasonable as well."}
{"text":"This diner is a great find. Wonderful food and the owner and cook Rudy is always working hard to make sure you are happy. The service is excellent and people are full of smiles"}
{"text":"This diner is off the beaten track.  The food is excellently prepared and perhaps the cleanest restaurant I have ever been in.  Breakfast menu is traditional American breakfast.  Eggs were cooked perfectly and the oatmeal was perfect.  Plan on sharing the oatmeal. It was enough for three people.  My new go to diner when in vegas."}
{"text":"Dont come here if youre not white. We came in and were asked to wait even though tables were wide open. No greeting, just a \"youre gonna have to wait.\". She started moving things around, wiping down clean tables, messing with the tv and remote for like 3 minutes, gave other people their check, etc... It was as if she wanted us to leave because we were Mexican. This was an old, white, heavy, seemingly southern woman so it wasnt surprising. We're from San Diego, so this was shocking and disturbing, but discrimination is probably more prevalent in Nevada than it is in California."}
{"text":"Great food diner. And they were nice enough to serve us breakfast after the cut off time."}
{"text":"In the midst of the Deep South (Las Vegas) when you cannot find breakfast at 10:40 am... You can count on The Diner at LVM Resort. 

While they may be a bit out of the way and discoverable only through word of mouth or fabulous sites like Yelp, you will come back every time you are on your way in... Or out of Vegas. 

The service is outstanding, they come to your table in a jif and... Treat you like you are a regular on your first visit. Can you beat that? 

As a \"hungry for breakfast\" patron, I highly recommend this quaint diner for anyone looking for a traditional breakfast in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great home style food. Great service and kind staff. We frequent this establishment often and would highly recommend if you are looking for a relaxed atmosphere with great food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Just finished breakfast here...2nd time this weekend. Great food, even better energy. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is exactly what I wanted. The food was delicious and the staff was very welcoming. As a fan of spice, I asked for Tobacco and was given a choice of six different varieties of hot sauce. I discovered a new hot sauce to add to my cabinet. I could not recommended this diner more enthusiastically."}
{"text":"No complaints! The food was delicious and the portions were huge! Two people could probably split one plate. I had the pancakes, sausage, and eggs. If your hungry and want something local this is the place to go.

In response to the other comment below about racism.....maybe coming late and from the strip will play into the equation. It's like going to IHOP at 3 am wasted. Anyways, my family of four came from Texas to Vegas and we had a great experience....mind you we are full blown Mexicans. Never felt like our family was treated differently"}
{"text":"YUP this place is awesome! good food, 3 egg omelette is just amazing, pancake to its perfection and you also have an option to pick your own coffee creamer. My wife loves the food so much that she already has a plan of coming back next week with our kids. The staff is super friendly too"}
{"text":"Great little diner. Super friendly staff, fast service and great food. Huge portions at a good value. Would definitely come again on our way through! Restaurant and restrooms spotless too!"}
{"text":"I'd call this a small version of the traditional 50's diner for breakfast and lunch. The portions are very large at the prices are low! The food is great and the staff is extremely friendly. 

Bring a friend to share the ham and eggs!"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast with great personal service!  Spotless dining room and restrooms.  Excellent value and great food. Best breakfast in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Generous portions, excellent customer service, spotless clean, with nice 50's decor diner. Our server Brenda, welcomed us with a smile and was very attentive throughout. We found this place on our last day in Vegas, but we are surely coming back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for ham steak food is always good and the service is always good will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Cool 50s diner! Great food and service. Prices were very affordable. A good menu selection!"}
{"text":"Killer club is killer; stacked so high with goodness, it's almost hard to take a bite. For breakfast try the chicken fried steak hash browns and eggs, home made gravy with sausage.Super clean, great service! We love this place."}
{"text":"We found this rare gem while looking at houses in south LV, and wow this was a great surprise! 

Delicious food, reasonable prices, friendly service, and a rare 50's style that makes you feel like you're in a different place.

I had pancakes which filled the whole plate, sausage and eggs. My wife had the chicken fried steak. Both awesome and tasted homemade.  

The resturant was rather slow when we got there, so it was like we had a private diner. Staff was friendly and helpful, and we left feeling like we visited a neighbors house. We'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT! You will not be disappointed better than cheesy buffet food is great service is a fantastic,our family of four had a great breakfast for $42 left $50 with tip"}
{"text":"This is cutest, cleanest little diner. My husband and I stopped here for breakfast on our way home from Vegas and I was very pleased. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was fresh and delicious. The restroom was spotless. I highly recommend this diner."}
{"text":"Excellent service & food.  Only NO WI-FI !!  When waiting for food, kids on WIFI means quiet kids!"}
{"text":"Nice little diner to have breakfast at. We were on our way home from Vegas and stopped in here. We were a few minutes past their normal breakfast hours and they still made us our tasty breakfast fare. 

I had the chicken fried steak and eggs and it was delicious. The batter was well seasoned and the gravy was perfect consistency. 

Would go here again"}
{"text":"What a great little place!  Awesome food, incredible atmosphere.  I had the Philly Steak sandwich, which rivaled any one I've ever had before, and THE BEST steak fries, crisp and seasoned perfectly.  Portion size was huge!  Looking forward to trying their breakfast."}
{"text":"The secret is out! This place is awesome. Although small and quaint Donna was our waitress and was super friendly, prompt and delightful. We will definitely makes this place a regular stop on our Vegas trips. Food and atmosphere were amazing."}
{"text":"Nice small eatery.Great friendly atmosphere and the food is good. If it gets busy the kitchen is really small and can only handle so many orders at once your patience will pay off this is a great mom-and-pop place"}
{"text":"Recommended by a good friend of mine. Walked in was greeted by Rudy was told to have a seat anywhere we liked. We sat down looked at the menu, it was straight forward and to the point. Rudy came and took our order by we had no clue what to do order. I was hungry so he's like ham steak and it sounded good but I chose country fried steak and my fiancé ordered eggs Benedict. The food came out and it was hot and big. I knew there's no way I could finish my food and neither my fiancé could finish. We were going to order a 3rd entree but decided not to. Rudy's wife is a waitress there and she's such a sweetheart.  We made small talk and next thing I know we have some mutual friends. It was overall good and it's a hidden gem.."}
{"text":"We originally started the day trying to go get breakfast at the new Cracker Barrel at the Silverton, but the wait was 1.5 hours to get in.  So we found this place right up the road from there on Yelp. I am glad we went here instead. The place was a little hidden spot catering toa RV Motorcoach Resort. It had an old 1950's theme to it and it was a nice little setting. It is a small diner with only 8-10 booths and about 5 stools at the counter. But the breakfast was great, the place was clean and the staff was friendly. I had the Chicken Fried steak and eggs, My wife had the biscuits and gravy, both were well done like a good  basic breakfast should be done."}
{"text":"Lived in the area for over 2 years & never knew this place existed. Looks like a cute 50's diner. The server was great & said we could still have breakfast although it was over at 11 & it was now noon. The servings are huge! I had chicken fried steak with eggs, potatoes & toast. Hubby had biscuits & gravy (thought gravy was a little runny) that was really tasty & some of the best sausage links I've ever had. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great little place!  I've only had breakfast, but it is quickly becoming a regular place to go to for breakfast. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great food, great service, very cool \"old school\" diner. Price is very reasonable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best diner in Las Vegas.  We had the omelets and they were superb!  Fresh ingredients,  super friendly staff and a wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"For a breakfast to please the big appetite, this is the place.  Sparkling clean retro style diner, friendly staff.  I forgot to take a picture of the ham steak breakfast before I cut in half only to take 3/4 home it was so large.  Tried the chicken fried steak breakfast as  well;  equal to the ham steak.  Will try sharing  \"Killer Club\" the next time."}
{"text":"Best breakfast dinner in Las Vegas. Though it is small and a but hidden place is worth the drive. Customer service is excellent and food is amazing. Defiantly recommend to try this place you'll never want to eat breakfast anywhere else."}
{"text":"we have lived here for almost 2 years..  just down the street and didn't know it was here. Great diner, good food and excellent friendly staff....will be back often. ...highly recommend the pancakes"}
{"text":"Where to begin on this review. Let me start by saying that most businesses stay in business in spite of them selves not buy anything they do. This is a great example of one of those businesses I just moved to the area and thought this would be a good place to try for breakfast boy was I wrong.  As soon as I walked in and sat  down the waitress gave me look like what am I doing here. I almost left then which would have been a great decision. She took my order of eggs over easy bacon crisp and pancakes.  The order arrived and at first glance look very good. The eggs and bacon were perfect and the two hot cakes looked good. Then I tasted the hot cakes. I have no idea what kind of batter they use but the taste was awful. Two bites was all I could handle. I set the plate on the opposite side from me in hopes that either the waitress or the owner might notice I was displeased with the hot cakes. No luck there. I went ahead and ate the eggs and bacon and waited.  And waited some more. Finally the owner came by and I asked for my check. Still no mention of the uneaten pancakes. Finally my waitress came by and volunteers to bring me a box and I told her that would not solve the \"problem\". She ignored that comment,took away the pan cakes and that was all from her. I then asked the owner for the check, paid $10.00 for two eggs and 3 pieces of bacon. Would not recommend this place to anyone. If I could do no stars I would"}
{"text":"This place is great! Amazing onion rings and chicken salad sandwich. Love the old school look and employee's are always so nice!"}
{"text":"50's style diner with red glittered booths, black and white tiled floor, Coca-Cola memorabilia, totally retro style; you've got \"Mel\" in the kitchen cooking and a friendly blond \"Flo\" waitress!  I feel like I'm back in the 80's at Mel's Diner!  Great array of salads, burgers, fountain drinks.  We came for breakfast last time and the pancakes were great, home potatoes tasty and great eggs.  Good variety of omelettes and pancakes, biscuits and gravy too, lox platter is yummy.   Their chicken Cobb salad is fresh and delish, Austin had the burger and side salad - thumbs up. Excellent friendly service in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you are looking for a clean \"greasy spoon\" type of place.  At first I thought we must be out of our mind to go to a RV park for breakfast but I soon discovered when I got there that this is not an RV park and the food is yummy.  I've been here 3-4 times and each time the food is consistently good and the employees are friendly.  The chicken friend steak breakfast is huge and delicious.  The same goes for the ham and eggs.  If the place is busy (which it has been every time I have gone) be prepared to wait a short while.  This place is not big but worth the short wait."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Last minute find for a quick bite to eat.  Excellent service and food.  Killer club was huge.  Great sausage links and hash browns."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Super friendly staff and tasty food. Will be coming back for sure :)"}
{"text":"The House Burger is among the top three burgers that I have ever eaten. Fabulous coffee. EXCELLENT SERVICE. Liz T had breakfast and Dot had a BLT, all top-notch!"}
{"text":"Staff were great.  Food was wonderful.  I ordered well done steak and it was perfect.  Soft and juicy. The French toast was yummy.  Everything about this place is 5 star"}
{"text":"Perhaps we visited on an \"off\" day or perhaps the staff was recovering from a busy breakfast shift?  Whatever the case may be, it was the most awkward dining experiences I've had. Neither one of the staff members (front of the house) cracked a smile while we were there.  They both came across very matter of fact with little personality.  Now, you don't have to be Crusty the Clown or anything, but having a background in food and beverage, I have always been trained to go above and beyond to shoot for a higher tip.

Let's move away from the lack of congeniality and talk about the food..It was good!  Typical diner food reminiscent of my past growing up on diner food in New Jersey.  The ambiance was adorable, it's just a shame that the staff left much to be desired.

If I'm having a diner fix in the future I will probably expand my horizons and explore other options."}
{"text":"I'm not claiming this is a gourmet spot but if you're looking for a Dyna, then this is the real deal. The food isn't overly greasy. The ingredients are fresh and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Upon walking in they met my first requirement - cleanliness.  Then my second - good coffee, which many diners don't have.  Food was above average and service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is located inside of a resort area but it is a gem! The service was awesome, people are nice and meals are generous portions! It is clean, has a nice 50ish feel and feels extremely homey!

I got the bagel and lox platter and my boyfriend got the French toast, oatmeal, sourdough toast and side of bacon. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get too!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today. After waiting several moments to be told to seat yourself we sat in a small but comfortable booth in the back. The service was a little slow at 1st but when we ordered our food was delivered timely. The bacon was cooked perfectly,  eggs a little runny for over medium the hash browns are on point  and the Bng was very good. Over all a good breakfast. Just a note a few old coke signs and a route 66 plaque does not make a 50 ' s diner. Just saying."}
{"text":"Drove off the strip for breakfast because of the reviews. We were not disappointed. The food was fresh, the staff and owners were super friendly and our coffee mugs were never empty.

If you are looking for a Las Vegas strip experience - this is not it. It's a clean classic dinner with service that reflects the friendly customer service values of the 1950's."}
{"text":"Think back to the old sitcom called Alice where a struggling single mom is raising her son with an overbearing cook named Mel...got that picture - good keep it since this place looks and feels like Mel's Diner. The burgers are frozen and quite bland...my expectation of a diner was good homemade food, not packaged and slapped on a grill.

Nice staff..."}
{"text":"Hubby and I shared the awesomely killer, Killer Club Sandwich and a salad.  Plenty of GOOD FOOD. We couldn't finish it all,  we took it out the door with us. It was too good to leave behind.  The staff is personable and very friendly five star service. We highly recommend that you try the diner at Las Vegas Motor Coach Resort."}
{"text":"The omelettes are very cheesy, tasty, and filling. If you like cheese, this is the omelette for you. Excellent friendly service and great prices for the area."}
{"text":"This little podunk diner at the resort is a sweet stop for breakfast or lunch. Their ultra thick french toast was the bomb dot com and then some. The service was awesome and very caring. The cooks were super cool and fast. The decorations around the joint gave a very old fashioned 60s feel that made the atmosphere more relaxed. It is definitely a great breakfast and lunch place."}
{"text":"This is a great little 50's diner, well hidden down Arville.  If you blink, you'll miss it.

Their breakfast is AMAZING!  I recommend the French toast or the pancakes and make sure you bring your appetite, because you're getting a lot.

We went back for lunch, but I wasn't as impressed as I am with their breakfast.  This is my spot if I want some comfort food in the morning and don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Visited on a Monday around 1130am, it was not very busy. Our waitress Kelly was friendly and ready to serve us. I ordered the pastrami reuben sandwich with sweet potato fries, when delivered, it was served with regular french fries. The pastrami was sliced thick and tough with a little too much grease still dripping from the sandwich. 
Overall
Prices are reasonable.
The restaurant looked clean and taken care of.
Food was not for me
Probably will not return"}
{"text":"Great, fresh food, immaculate diner, very friendly service. We were very pleased in every way."}
{"text":"Whoever gave this one star needs to get a life. The food was great. The service was exceptional. The restaurant was spotless. The servers were personable and bubbly. Regulars came in and were greeted with hugs. My coffee cup was never empty AND they give you your own creamer bottle! (Flavored no less)! I'm so glad we found this diner, it's our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way from Vegas home to San Diego.  Fun spot! Small, but friendly, with good menu.  Hidden gem that supports a high-end RV park.  Who knew?  Great surprise; solid, good food.  Lovely service from staff."}
{"text":"The food was great and the dinner had tons of ambiance but the employees acted like they didn't care if you were there or not.   They weren't rude just ambivalent, making the breakfast experience a little odd."}
{"text":"Great as advertised by yelpers. Good prices, very clean. I sat at the counter ordered 2 eggs with hash browns crisp(yes they make them crispier on request) and rye toast.  Bread was fresh, potatoes were well cooked and for $4.99 why cook it at home?  Saw the french toast being cooked. BIG slices it looks like"}
{"text":"Great little diner right outside of the Vegas strip we stopped on our way back home. Great service our waitress always came by to check on us and refill our waters! Food was great I would definitely recommend the breakfast sandwich Yum!"}
{"text":"One of the most positive experiences I have had while in Vegas!!  Excellent service,  excellent food,  very clean!!  5 stars all around.  Nice stop for travelers from Va, visiting sin city."}
{"text":"This place is a great 50's style diner.  Breakfast was excellent and the service was friendly and timely.  Chicken fried steak and eggs was fantastic."}
{"text":"You know how much I love the food at The Diner? I love it so much that I easily eat there once a week, minimum. There have been a couple weeks where I've eaten there 3 days in a row! Some days I call and pick up a Cobb Salad or BLT. Other days I can meet with my husband and grab a Frisco Burger or a Corned Beef on Rye. The french fries are especially delicious. 
The service is superb (I don't know what happened with the one bad review below). I've eaten there a couple hundred times with everything from 2 people to 8 people (we just take up 2 booths). My favorite is when we bring small children and the owners pull out full coloring books and crayons. The kids love it at there and so do we!"}
{"text":"Found this place in Yelp. Can't agree more, this place is a gem. The food was terrific. The ambiance and music were out of the 50's era. Love it! Love it!"}
{"text":"Best hidden gem ever- amazing service friendly people and even better food. Will return for sure when in Vegas again"}
{"text":"Food is incredible and the service is unmatched. Everyone is friendly beyond belief. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Incredibly clean diner with nice staff but this yelper left feeling that the 84 reviews and 4.5 star rating had seriously betrayed me. The pancake tasted like cake batter and fell apart. The sausage patty was flaccid and had more filler than meat. The small packet of jellies were old. The $3 cup of coffee was extremely bitter.  On a positive note, the scrambled eggs were fine."}
{"text":"Came here after finding out Cracker Barrel's wait time was 2 hours. I was starving and couldn't wait that long so I did a Yelp search and found this diner. This place is less than 5 minutes drive from Silverton.
The owner and his wife is so nice. They like to talk to their customers. She came over to our table to check on us more than five times when we were eating. 
Their menu is very simple. I had a cup of chili and Philly Cheese steak sandwich. It was delicious. Their potato salad was a little too sugary for me. I never had a sweet tasting potato salad so I was surprised. She said everything is homemade and they use Bore's Head meats. 
Comfortable booth seating. 
Only open till 2:30 pm. I asked her why and she said because they don't have liquor license. (?)
Great option when you are hungry and can't wait two hours for Cracker barrel's breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding.  However it seemed the staff was short handed and our wait was lengthy.  As a result, the cook was grumpy and the waitress was frazzled.  The restaurant was extremely clean.  The chicken fried steak was excellent and I don't normally order this type of food but I did based on the reviews.  Despite the grumpy chef - I would give him a second try!

We were there on Monday 2-15-2016."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, generous diner cuisine. Eat-off-the-floor cleanliness. Free jukebox. Owners are a kind, sweet couple. Worth going a few blocks off the interstate."}
{"text":"Good bowl of chilli for lunch, did not charge me extra for cheese. Played songs from the '70's I really like, excellent waitress."}
{"text":"I was excited to come and try this place out with the pictures of the food on Yelp. 

Huge disappointment. Party of 7 sat at 2 different tables. My wife, two daughters and her mother in one and myself and my parents in another. We ordered lunch it was 5 minutes till 11am and the black board said lunch was only till 11am.

The server/owner I believe said it was fine to order lunch. I ordered ruben sandwich with corned beef, mom ordered Chipotle chicken sandwich which was on the black board, dad order Philly cheese steak sandwich.

Half an hour went by and my wife's table got their food. Lox bagel platter. The cook which I'm assuming it's either the husband of our server/owner came to our table and said they needed to get the breakfast out first.

An hour after our order was taken we still hadn't received our food. I stood up and talked to our waitress and told her we wanted to cancel. She turned to the husband/cook and told him we were canceling. He didn't seem too care at all. So we left. Horrible experience that my family and I were looking forward to."}
{"text":"They run this place like it's their kitchen of family you don't really want. Workers' families constantly hanging out and running around, loud discussions, talking politics constantly (sometimes you just don't want to hear it, even if you agree). There's a time and place and all we wanted was a nice breakfast. Food is overpriced but good. Service depends on who you get. Doesn't run like a traditional diner- open at 7:30 and closes at 2:30. Served breakfast until 11 am only. Convenient but not worth it."}
{"text":"I found this Hidden Gem on the outskirts of Las Vegas strip and was a wonderful spot!  We had lunch and the food was delicious!  You defiantly get your money's worth:)"}
{"text":"I love this place!! It's such a cute little 50's diner. The staff is great and I'm in love with the Blt sandwich. The food is always piping hot and amazing"}
{"text":"The reviews are very inaccurate. $3/Cup of coffee that was so bitter and strong we both reacted to it when we took a sip. We ordered 2pancakes 2eggs 2sausage patties. The pancakes are huge but who cares? Bland, cakey, and dry. Sausage patties were not cooked through and were such a poor quality of meat we couldn't eat it. The eggs were done right. 

Cute diner, and the cook was charming. But we paid $18.35 for 2coffees and that plate. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"This is an RV park diner. Would have been nice if summer closure was listed on website! Still on my list, but they lose stars for not posting current hours. We drove out of our way, for nothing."}
{"text":"My son Matthew and I have been having breakfast there every weekend for over a year Great food and service! The eggs are incredibly tasty!"}
{"text":"Best diner I've ever been to.  I ordered eggs Benedict and coffee. When I asked for hot sauce, they gave me 5 sauces.  Best service, mom-pop-shop feel.  This will be my breakfast diner when I study."}
{"text":"I like the ambience of this place. It is cozy and has a \"real diner feel\". Food is great and service is awesome. It says that breakfast is until 11 am but we've been here twice after 11 and they catered to our breakfast needs."}
{"text":"We did not like this place. Dry flaky pancakes over cooked French toast. Eggs and bacon ok budgets and alright. I would not come here again. It's not hard to find.. Enter the resort before the gate make a left."}
{"text":"Small quite place but very good food! Everything is clean and the staff is very sweet. Rudy is very attentive and makes sure you're well taken care of. It seems as if everything is either made from scratch or what you would find in your own home in a positive way. For example you don't have to use 12 of those stupid creamer cups they have the whole Nestle creamer bottles. Would really recommend for a good personal breakfast. For me it was a great escape from the busy Vegas atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The 3-item omelet was HUGE and loaded with ingredients! The pancakes were large and fluffy, just perfect! Service is a tad slow, but super friendly... not bad for only one waitress in a full diner! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"There's nothing groundbreaking or innovative going on here. If you are looking for a decent breakfast at a good price then come here. The place is cute and clean done in a 50s style diner. It's not far off the strip and worth the short 5 min drive. Service was exceptional. My coffee never got below half full. Everything was made to order and came out fast! My eggs were great, bacon was crispy and English muffin better than most. My only complaint was that the price of the coffee was a bit steep. At $2.99 I felt like I should sit there for a couple hours and get my money's worth. But, I am in Vegas so I have other things to do.  I would come back here again when in town."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is a hidden gem at a local neighborhood off strip. The restaurants on the strip can suck it!!! The food and services here are excellent. Cute little diner has the 60s feel. The proton is big for me, I ate half and finish the other half later. The coffee is excellent, it gives me the good morning kick start. You should try their multi grains pancakes. It is fluffy and a little hint of crunch. I will definitely come back when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Cute little diner, the one waitress is very efficient. The food was really good. I had the club ended up taking a fair bit with me. My husband has the cheese burger and said it tasted delicious very homemade. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The people on Yelp come through again.  I saw a review for this diner many months ago, bookmarked it, but never went.  The other day before running some errands, I stopped here to have breakfast.

They have a 3 item (your choice) omelette option and I went with that.  I got mushrooms, spinach, and pepper jack cheese.  The omelette came with hash browns and toast.  I opted for rye toast and it was the swirl rye.  The omelette had a large amount of the three items.  Coffee was brought before I ordered an refilled several times.

A few things about the place.  It's small and quaint with Coca Cola memorabilia.  The menu says breakfast is served to 10:30.  I arrived close to 10:30 and the server, Brenda, told me they could stretch the time a bit and that they will make an omelette any time of the day.  The menu is limited.  Don't expect to get stuffed French toast or exotic flavored pancakes.  This is a basic diner with basic diner food well prepared.  The neon sign inside says 50s Diner and I think they go by just The Diner at LVM because of the other 50s diner in town.  Parking is ample in front and the grounds fo the LVM are really nice--at least what you can see from the entrance.

I had a pleasant time sitting at the counter and watching the cook do his thing and just taking in the behind the scenes activities.  Brenda was a fine server and very pleasant woman.

Had it not been for Yelp, I would never have known that there was an LVM Resort or a diner open to the public there."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because of the reviews, all those 5 stars. What a disappointment. While the staff was friendly and fast service the food was sub par. 

I ordered the hot pastrami on rye. It was so dry I needed two cokes to get it down. It was also tasteless. My wife ordered the House Burger. While she thought it tasted good the meat looked very dry. I did try some of the meat and it was dry and not seasoned at all. 

The Diner at LMV Resort is not a place I would return to."}
{"text":"So, truthfully, I was really looking forward to eating here.  Unfortunately, the old waitress staffing the small joint wasn't up for serving my party.  Full disclosure: we were a group of 4, two girls and two guys.  It was the late morning after a long night on the strip and we all had the remains of makeup still on our face.  The two guys in our group have long hair and we aren't white.  We aren't stuffy or old or upper middle class.  We were comfy and young and we were polite and hungry.  But no service.  Sorry we didn't pack polos.

The waitress tells us curtly that it'll be a couple of minutes when we walk in but we don't mind waiting.  She is the only waitress but there are only two tables with people eating and one waiting for their check.  There are at least 6 tables free (small place).  She hands the couple their check and suddenly isn't short for words.  She's talking and joking and laughing and smiling.  She chats for a bit with their table then turns back to where we are and tells us it'll be a bit longer, she has to get a table ready.  No smiling.  She starts wiping down one of the clean tables.  Then she rearranges the menus on the table.  Another wipe down.  After that she doesn't turn toward the door and goes straight for the television.  She starts channel surfing.  Slowly.  Then she starts playing with the volume.  Up.  No wait, too loud.  Maybe a little louder.  Changes the channel again.  She walks up to another table to talk while avoiding our eyes.  We see a sign that says they stop breakfast at 11.  We missed breakfast?  Forget it.  Waited, sorry, WASTED 15 minutes for an empty restaurant and a racist old waitress.

Save your money.  And please ma'am, save your judgements."}
{"text":"I asked nicely for their chicken fried steak (it was 11:45 so breakfast service was finished) and their cook was nice enough to make it for me anyways.  No pre-made chicken fried steak here.  True to the classic diner tradition, hand breaded, down home deliciousness.  And my wife's killer club was indeed killer...Friendly staff, good food and nearby.  Will be back fo sho!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast ...   No wait ..!!  Even on Father's Day !   Super friendly staff and good food .. Great omelettes.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"OK, so the other day (12/6/13) we returned to The Diner at LVM Resort, but this time for lunch.  We had a fine breakfast some time back, and really enjoyed meeting the owners Rudy and Donna (cook and waitress), so we figured we'd give lunch a try.

Once again, we were struck by the immaculate appearance of the place; all tables and counters spotless, all floors likewise, all vinyl booths crumb-less, all windows large and streak-less.  This place is kept in tip-top shape.  And we love the 50's diner décor.  Sort of, \"Route 66 meets Mel's Diner.\"

Upon seating ourselves we were immediately approached by Donna for our drink orders, and then we perused the menu.  My wife opted to start with the chicken noodle soup, and I was a bit skeptical of the chili.  Donna suggested a small sampler, which sealed the deal.  I ordered a bowl, and she suggested chopped onions and cheese on top, which proved wonderful.  For $4 it's almost a meal in itself.

My wife's soup was great tasting and filling.

I ordered the Reuben on rye with extra dressing on the side, with fries.  The spousal unit ordered the corned beef on rye with cole slaw.  Both tasted great.

In addition to enjoying another fine meal we also enjoyed a chance to visit with Rudy and Donna.  Rudy grew up under the thumb of Russian communism in Czechoslovakia, and highly prizes his freedoms in America, and the capitalistic system that allows him to run his own business and fail or succeed based on his own hard work.  He eschews all forms of communism and socialism, and makes a lively case for the free enterprise system that drives (used to drive?) America.

Hurry on out to The Diner at LVM Resort (breakfast and lunch, no dinner).  You'll love the food, the jovial service, and ,if you want it, the lively conversation.  

You'll have to work to find them, about a block and a half north of Blue Diamond, on Arville, at the entrance to the fancy-schmancy motorhome park called the LVM  Resort.

It's \"resort\" quality at 50's diner prices ... with a dash of joviality mixed in.

{"text":"My husband and I are not from Vegas, but we heard about this cute little diner and decided to give it a try! Sooooooo glad we did! The owners/managers were so sweet and polite! The food was DELICIOUS! It was just like  my \"mom\" used to make!"}
{"text":"Cute little dinner in a RV park.  Fast and friendly service.  We stopped in on a Thursday morning and were the only ones in there.  The waiter was also the cook.  Great prices!"}
{"text":"Well worth a 5 minute drive off the interstate.  This diner was exceptionally clean, the food was great with generous portions and fresh ingredients, and the staff was welcoming to both us and our 2 children."}
{"text":"What a great place! Very friendly staff and giant sized great tasting food... The owner is a very friendly man! Visit this place and you will leave happy."}
{"text":"Great food with great prices! Cute little diner, worth stopping by. I had the BTL with fries and it was really good."}
{"text":"On my way back home I decide to yelp for some breakfast and this place popped up and it was 4 and 1/2 stars so I say why not and tryed it. wow 5 ++++++++++ stars is what they deserve GREAT FOODS and AMAZING SERVICE!!!!! Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing little diner in Las Vegas. Great breakfast. Even GLUTEN FREE French Toast. My daughter was so happy. I had a great omelette. Terrific ham and bacon"}
{"text":"This was our second visit, both times have been excellent. Great food, and even better service. Very relaxed atmosphere, diner styling. Clean, well decorated. Just a great place to have breakfast or lunch and be treated like family even on a first visit."}
{"text":"Best keep secret, my patty melt was to die for! The
 hubby had steak and eggs cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Great people, awesome food, and the prices are fantastic. Walked this place for the first time the juke box was play great music and set the mood for breakfast."}
{"text":"The staff was kind and helpful and the food was AMAZING! I would definitely recommend anyone trying this place if you're looking for a yummy and fast breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"This was a great place to stop at on the way out of Vegas to Red Rock Canyon and it did not disappoint.  Two eggs, meat, potatoes and toast for under $10 in Las Vegas is impossible, but this diner came through completely.

It is built outside of a very upscale RV park.  VERY.  It has a very retro decor and is very clean with about 12 booths. 

Breakfast was served quickly, tasted great and the refills of coffee kept coming which is a plus in my eyes.  They had several different kinds of coffee creamer which is unsual to see.

The waitress was really nice, tables cleared, but not too quick - timing is everything in life.  This is a place to go to if you want a inexpensive breakfast off the strip."}
{"text":"Exactly as advertised.  Solid classic diner from food, decor, to the warm and friendly service.  None of the greasy spoon though as the place is spotlessly clean.

May be slightly out of the way and an unusual location, but it is truly a hidden gem.  Drive into the \"Motorcoach Resort\" and turn left immediately.

We had a craving for breakfast food at half past 11.  While the menu said breakfast is served until 11AM, they made an exception and allowed us order breakfast any way.

Most surprising thing of our visit, they have almond milk to go eith my coffee!  As someone who is lactose intolerant, this is HUGE!  

French Toast with bacon.  4 slices of toast with 3 slices of crunchy bacon, the kind that breaks apart when you cut down with the side of your fork.   Yummm!"}
{"text":"Fair - good prices for unremarkable food.  Waitress was competent but never checked back. Slipped the bill on the table without even asking if we needed anything else.  Not worth a trip back."}
{"text":"We saw the great reviews and wanted to try breakfast here. 

Upside-
Food came out quickly
Cute, cozy diner atmosphere 
Decent prices
Seated wishing 5 minutes even during Sunday breakfast

Downside-
Food was ok, not great
Ham steak was overly salty
Food wasn't served very hot even though it came out quickly 
Service was ok

Overall experience was fine, not fantastic. This cute little place has potential though. Service staff needs training on how to be efficient when stopping by a table. They seem to have that mentality where they just keep their head down and do a task instead of looking around and being alert to the needs of the other customers nearby (and a few more smiles wouldn't hurt). Not a bad idea to drop checks shortly after food is served like they do at other breakfast joints. We saw 2 tables that waited for their checks impatiently for 5+ minutes."}
{"text":"As good as their rating.  I would have given them 5 stars if there wasn't too much pepper in the biscuits and gravy.  What a great, giant pancake.  Wonderful Diet Coke."}
{"text":"Cute little 50s diner with home style cooked food at a great price. Flavored cream for our coffee and wonderdul service...Brenda was lovely!"}
{"text":"Best Diner in Town. Great food, exceptional and friendly service. You should try the \"FrankySpecial\" or the \"LuppeSpecial\" on the \"secret menu\".  F"}
{"text":"Absolutely an awesome breakfast place. Filled with cute coca cola memorabilia. We loved the bacon, extra crispy hash browns (ask for it) and a huge and tasty chicken fried steak with gravy."}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast and service here.  Must try, I guarantee you'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"This looks like a time warp into the 50's. An extremely clean and retro looking diner with friendly owners and service who will provide you with high quality food and great taste. The ham steak was outstanding, half inch thick and 12 inches in diameter. The coffee was hot and great and the owner's stories can't be beaten."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food which is way more affordable than anything around.   I've never finished my meal here,  but that's only because the portions are huge.    The owner also works here,  so it has this great little small town / family feel."}
{"text":"The breakfast was incredible and cheap! 
 
Chicken fried steak 
Potato cubes 
Eggs 
$10

The service was great, small little hidden spot."}
{"text":"BEST BURGER IN TOWN!
As other rave reviews have said, the service is wonderful and friendly the food is great, and the prices are reasonable.
It's a bit hard to find on Arville (just north of Blue Diamond), but definitely worth the effort!
Try it -- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What an unexpected great experience!!

The Yelp app update came in handy Sunday morning when I was too lazy to think of what I wanted for breakfast. On the Search button it listed The Diner under What's for Breakfast? At first, I was like - \"what the heck is the LVM resort?\" As a Jersey girl who LOVES her diners, I was excited to give this place a try. It was just down the street, and when I looked at the map - I thought it was in a residential subdivision. You could only imagine my surprise when we pulled into this Spanish Trails-esque  entrance and found this adorable diner right where Yelp said it was. I have never heard of a motorcoach resort and apparently I've been living a mile from one for years. The Diner is tucked away on your immediate left as you turn into the LVM.

The service was AWESOME. I mean I've said awesome before and meant it but the service here was truly and absolutely MOST awesome.  Our waitress and the owner took great care of us. There is a fine line between great service and obtrusive service and here was nowhere near that line. I felt like I was at a nice person's house and they were excited to have me over. It was perfect. BIG plus - we ordered coffee and they let us know they had almost every flavor of creamer we could imagine. And they give you the bottle for your table. This amazed my husband. He took a picture of it and everything.

The food was great diner food. If you love \"true\" diners, then this place is a must-eat. If you've never been to a true diner or you aren't sure - it's a must eat for you too. We both ordered the same thing at the waitress' suggestion : chicken fried steak. It was plenty of food for the price and everything was cooked perfectly. The CFS was crispy & crunchy, the gravy tasted lovely - my husband scarfed it down and I could barely finish my plate.  

The 50s diner & décor is just homey to me. The white walls, red vinyl booths, old school coca-cola napkin dispenser, the old posters on the walls - it brought back a lot of memories of diner-hopping when I was a kid.

This is our new favorite spot. We can't wait to go back and have breakfast again, but I think we'll head over for lunch sometime very soon (they aren't open for dinner). The waitress let us know that their burgers are fresh not frozen and they strive for fresh-quality as much as they can.

Go ahead, hit the bookmark button and plan a trip here for breakfast, brunch or lunch. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely The Best Breakfast I have ever had in Las Vegas. Food was hot,  delicious, and my coffee mug was never empty. Great customer service. Naturally friendly. .. And NOT CROWED at all. Simply THE BEST"}
{"text":"Great food and great portions. I teally love the decor. Also, the stafff is very friendly, you can't beat that."}
{"text":"I wanted to find a nice / affordable breakfast spot close to my hotel this year in Vegas.

The diner did not disappoint. Service was great, restaurant was spotless and the food was incredible. I would call this hidden gem in Vegas!!

Will be coming back on my next visit for sure."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday and almost barely missed breakfast. Hours are 8AM-1:30PM with breakfast ending at 11AM. Ordered eggs over easy & bacon with a coffee. Eggs came out perfect, bacon was crispy the way I like it. Coffee was a bit bitter and not really worth the three dollars. My partner ordered the pancakes and sausage. I wouldn't suggest the pancakes. They were a big portion, but don't be fooled. The consistency was dry and fell apart easily. Tried a bite for a taste anyway, which wasn't too bad. Our waitress was great and very nice. Overall everything was good minus the dry pancakes and overpriced coffee."}
{"text":"So if you like diner grub then this little joint is for you.  The waitresses are sassy and a bit gruff.   The owner is a grumpy guy who turned away some folks that arrived 10 minutes before closing.  

Now on to the food.......
Huge plate of breakfast staples are delivered to you.  I mean a serious gut busting plate of eggs, bacon, hash browns, chicken fried steak smothered in country sausage gravy and buttered toast.   There is nothing fancy about the food, just well prepared breakfast done right.    The coffee was good and they kept the cup warmed up regularly. 

The decor is kitschy diner.  Juke boxes, chrome, Formica and tile floors. Lots of white with black  and corvette red accents.  

This is a special little place at the front gates of a motor home park that is fairly high end with lots of landscaping and palm trees.  We will be back to this little hole in the wall diner!"}
{"text":"American diner from the decor, to the food and friendly staff. The owner thanked us personally and made sure to check with every table about their experiences. They don't have anything fancy, but they definitely have old school charm."}
{"text":"Good reviews brought us here. After being greeted by the super friendly staff we assumed that customer service was the main reason for the good reviews. We were wrong. Several people on their way out were raving and ranting about how good the food was and they were totally right.  The breakfast omelettes were amazing and even the toast that came with it was great. We will be coming back every time we pass through Vegas!"}
{"text":"Cute little dinner. Cheap prices and good food too. The kid ordered a steak. It came out quickly and was perfectly cooked. I ordered a mushroom omelette and it was huge.  The staff was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast while in Vegas. Very fun place. Great old time diner feel. Our waitress was very enjoyable. She loves her job and it shows. Very large portions. But you pay for it. A little hard to find as it is tucked behind a wall just inside the RV park entrance"}
{"text":"Great place for a good hearty breakfast. Liked their chicken fried steak and their Multigrain pancakes.  Yes it is in the lot of the motorcoach resort."}
{"text":"Off the strip and on the way to the Bonnie Springs/Red Rock Canyon area. We stopped by for a simple breakfast and really enjoyed it here. It's 50s themed with bar stools at the kitchen. Inside is small but just perfect for a group of 4 adults or less; family-friendly. 

Breakfast for us:
French toast with bacon and a side of biscuits with gravy 
Scrambled eggs with potatoes and maple rye bread

I ate my plate clean which is rare since I'm petite. From the bathroom to the floor and booths everything was clean and well kept. 

Service was great! Prices are just as good and quite frankly, I'd rather eat here than some of the places on the strip."}
{"text":"I love breakfast foods and definitely eat alot of it, so this place is definitely up to par. Huge portion compared to the price you pay so. Make sure you don't hungry! Also customer service was great and was very surprised about how fast it was considering there was only one waitress and a busgirl. Very friendly and would come back again."}
{"text":"This place really is a hidden gem the food was fantastic and a great atmosphere highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This little cafe was truly a delightful place to go have a delicious breakfast. Even with a full parking lot I was greeted and seated immediately. The service and the food were wonderful, as well, the classic 50s motif is done well. Their prices are very reasonable and I would definitely recommend this little diner, and I'd return again for more good food."}
{"text":"I drove by many times and then one day i decided to give it a try. Since then it has been a destination for myself and my friends for a very good and quiet place to meet and eat. The food is great and the service is outstanding and friendly. 
We have everything from breakfast and sandwiches to salads and a bowl of chili. Always very good and great portions."}
