{"text":"Just this moment got back from dinner at the Carriage Inn in Elizabeth, Pa. I stopped long enough to make myself a sandwich of one slice yellow cheese on two slices plain white bread and that alone was miles ahead of what I was served at Carriage Inn for a meal, before I wrote this review. Completely inedible.  Ordered fish on a dish with onion rings and cole slaw.  The fish was cold, greasy, and limp. Same for the rings. The slaw was dry and sour. My nephew's fish was the same.  My friends medium well steak arrived rare, was sent back and returned well done.  Exceedingly frustrating, and as the 'manager wasn't on duty' there was nothing anyone could do about adjusting the bill for all the uneaten, and I mean uneaten, food.  I won't be back.  They won't miss me. There's a sucker born every minute !"}
{"text":"First time at carriage inn, food overcooked coleslaw tasted like mayo. Had the rudest waitress slamming take out box on table. Won't be back there anytime soon, more like never."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and our kiddos this past weekend. I'm from the area but haven't been here in forever. what a gem. I ordered my true test of a restaurant-the rueben. It was fabulous and the thousand island sauce was delicious. I ordered chippers and they were so good, but they are an additional cost. I really wish it was a combo or you got a larger portion, but really everything was great. The waitress was attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend's go to every Wednesday night for the best wings in the burgh! Piping hot and crispy with great sauces they have a $7 pitcher of blue moon special that pairs nicely with the wings  And if you're not into wings everything on their menu is fabulous, hot and delicious   Oh and the hostess is such a sweetheart, and the servers are always great"}
{"text":"Popped in for dinner on our way back from Century III area.  Parking lot relatively full.  Place was busy - usually a good sign.  In this area, this mean's the food is either good or cheap - sometimes both.  We were seated right away - hostess was friendly.  Noticed that the day we were there it was $5 burger night, but we decided to use the Enjoy Coupon we had.  I ordered a ginger ale - thought the price was a little steep at $2.50 but then again it was unlimited refills.  My date had a Sam Adams seasonal draft - $4.00; price would be OK if we were in downtown Pittsburgh.  I ordered the Hot Roast Beef sandwich with a side of fries and a side salad (2 sides come with the meal).  Sandwich was OK - more than enough beef on two slices of Texas-sized bread.  Brown gravy at least tasted homemade - no lumps.  Fries were served on a separate plate - I had asked for gravy on the fries but our waitress forgot.  She had no problem running back to the kitchen and loading them up with some gravy.  Salad was OK - just be aware that they charge another $0.65 for the hot/cold homemade bacon dressing - something I think the waitress should have told me.  My date ordered the Carriage Inn Sirloin.  Cooked to her liking (medium rare), it was pretty tasty.  She also ordered the cole slaw (OK) and the zucchini fries (also not bad).  As for the service? Fantastic.  Our waitress stopped by several times to check on us.  Not only that, but other waitresses stopped by, took our plates when we were finished, and I think the manager also stopped by a couple times to check on us.  After the coupon tax and tip, total bill was around $33.  Food was OK - we both gave it a solid 3 stars.  Big question is - would we go back?  Sure, why not?  No reason not to, plus there were some other things on the menu we'd like to try."}
{"text":"We walked in on a busy Friday evening, and we're seated immediately. We had a very friendly waiter that took care of all of our needs very efficiently. She had soup and a wedge salad which she said was amazing, and I had the Linguini alfredo with shrimp and it was terrific. We most certainly would come back."}
{"text":"We had eaten here in the past, but not for a long time.  We always felt that the servers exhibited an attitude - as if they were doing us a huge service by waiting on us.  Well, the food is O.K. - we eat out a lot and this is a little above  average fare   - not great, but not bad.  Once again we had a rude server who was annoyed because we asked for more butter.  Then when another person with us (2 couples total - 4 people) asked for extra dinner rolls - only had one per person and the men wanted more - she brought just ONE extra roll and practically threw it one the table.  She never asked how everything was or if we wanted anything else so my husband got her attention when she was at the next table by saying \"Excuse me, could we please have coffe?\"  She gave us a very loud sigh and walked away.  The people at that other table said they were never coming back.  By the way - that dcoffee we were all waiting for never showed up.  Our server must have  gone on break because we didn't see her again.  Another poerson dropped off our bill. Last time for us.  Too many other restaurants with great food AND great staff!!!  You're probably asking why we didn't complain to the manager.  Because the owner has the same attitude!  By the way, friends of ours stopped on the \"All You Can Eat Crab Legs\" night.  Had their first plate and asked for seconds.  When finished with that, they asked for more and were told by the server that \"that was all they could eat.\"  They complained and were told by the person in charge (not sure if manager) that no one ever gets thirds and they couldn't have more.  Believe me, this is not the first person to complain about this.  i just didn't want to believe it!  We are so done with this place."}
{"text":"Last weekend I won a gift card to the carriage inn at a Chinese auction.  I decided to take my family there for lunch on Saturday afternoon.  I wasn't sure what to expect so when we pulled up I walked in first to check the place out.  To my surprise the bar area was very nice.  I went to the car to wave my wife and two small children into the restaurant.  We sat at a booth that was semiprivate. We had our own small TV.  This place had great atmosphere for college football.  Plenty of HD TVs.  Great children menus for the kids!!  I had a french dip that the waitress recommended.  It was high quality meat with no fat.  My wife had a chicken Philly that needed a bit more meat. Kids food was standard.  I ordered the french onion soup as recommended from other reviews.  It could have been a bit crispier on top.  I'm thinking maybe it was microwaved.  This place has a great menu that is better than your standard bar menu.  I will defiantly be returning to check out the dinner menu.  There is a reason this place has been around for a long time.  They are very friendly with quality food. It's worth the drive to Elizabeth!!"}
{"text":"Best wings. Really good service. I'd recommend wing night to anyone. They have decent food and tons of options."}
{"text":"Soups and foods are typically very good...French Onion soup and buffalo chicken soup are both very good, beef melt  is good, white pizza excellent, burgers good, fish good...been coming here for years, have never really been served a bad meal at the carriage  Update 12/17/16 Carriage now has a $.65 upcharge for ranch with your fries and the added $1.75 charge for fries or chips"}
{"text":"Portions are getting really small.  Got the steak hoagie.  8 inch sandwich bun! very little meat. I will stick to the wings for now on."}
{"text":"OMG! My prime rib was awesome! My wife really enjoyed her glazed salmon. The place was crowded. I reluctantly stopped in to dine and I'm glad I did. The staff made it look easy. Our waitress was working tables, but I never felt neglected. Drink refills were timely and the waitress made sure we were happy with our meal."}
{"text":"Always have had good service, can have a wait in wing nights but line moves fast.  Good price and value for portions you get..... Josh does a great job as Manager too !!"}
{"text":"So I just moved to the area and my boyfriend took me to this dump for dinner after a long day of moving. I was stressed and tired and starving from packing and moving all week and it really just wanted a whiskey and some pub food. I ordered a Jameson ginger and took two sips then I noticed a fly floating in my drink!! I almost puked! I sent it back and asked for another one. The waitress acted like it was nothing!! She brought me another... WITH ANOTHER FLY! Or maybe even the same one! Who knows. So I order a beer. The food comes.. (I'm a vegetarian by the way and there was absolutely no options for me.. So I just got fries) which were awful! Even my boyfriend complained about the calzone he got. As were waiting for the bill I felt a little tickle on my face and I just thought it was my hair so I didn't react. Then my boyfriend reached across the table and picked AN ANY CRAWLING ACROSS MY FACE!!! What?!? Yes! This place is disgusting. Filthy dishes and gross food. We will never be going back. Steer clear!"}
{"text":"Wednesday night is Wing Night.  We made the trek.  They were crazy busy, as expected.  Super staff - six of us seated quickly.    Appetizers:  Blooming onion, zucchini and pickle chips - all hot, all good - yummy \"secret sauce\"  I needed (yes, needed) the chicken dumpling soup.  So good and apparently a year round staple of the Carriage Inn - do try it!  Wings:  dry seasoned and hot buffalo - whole wings and really tasty.  Plenty for tomorrow - who doesn't love a white bag for the road??  Calzone was huge and Friends loved it.  Philly cheese steak, also thumbs up  Bottomless beverages.  With all that, no room for dessert - maybe next time!"}
{"text":"We've been going to the Carriage Inn regularly for probably 25 to 30 years. That, in itself, has to tell you something. Over that period of time we've grown to consider most of the management and staff there pretty much family. It's not a fancy gourmet experience, although they do whip up some pretty awesome daily specials. Rather, it's a convenient place where you can get a good meal at a fair price. They are not the only game in town but they are the game we prefer to play, two to three times per week. The staff and management are always attentive. They have an extensive menu where you can count on the quality of food and service to be consistent week in and week out. If you are in the area, give them a try. You won't be disappointed. BTW, in my opinion, they have the very best pizza in the area. Hands down!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Felt like left overs from a party. The staff was very nice. Manager stopped by to check on our table. As a chef i try not to nitpick, but the fish was not fully cooked, It was tilapia and need to be fully cooked, this was not salmon nor tuna which fare well under cooked."}
{"text":"My company hosted a large event where the Carriage Inn catered for us. Let me say the whole process from start to finish was amazing. Before the event, A co-worker and I came in to sample some of the food that we were considering having. I was expecting one little riblet for each of us, but they actually brought out a half slab of ribs on the house for us to try- what amazing customer service! They were able to work with our custom menu needs, and I am absolutely shocked with how much food we were able to get within our budget. When the day of the event finally arrived, everybody was so happy with the selections of food. The staff who were brought to serve the food were very pleasant to work with. No complaining here about anything- although I would have loved for them to bring their meat smoker on site, but it just wasn't an option this time. I will be sure to use them for any future events! Thanks Josh"}
