{"text":"This restaurant was the ABSOLUTE WORST! HENCE MY COMMENT FOR SOME CLOSURE ON THIS TERRIBLE RESAURANT. If zero stars were an option I would leave nothing.  I ordered the Capon for 2 and got this very well presented dish however the actual bird was horrible. So much salt I thought I was going to have a stroke. I brought it home for my dog, I couldn't believe MY DOG LICKED IT ONCE AND DID NOT TOUCH IT FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT!!!! LOL The service was so terrible I thought we should walk.  The least management could have done was taken the terrible food off of our bills, nope NOTHING  was done! Stay away from this place or assume the consequences of memories that will forever haunt you, every time I think of this place I am annoyed at the fact that I actually handed them my credit card to pay for this meal.  I would hope for an apology or a complimentary something...I will update you if management takes any decisions via YELP to save their reputation!"}
{"text":"The monstrosity was listed as the entrecôte for two, so I had an idea of what to look forward to, but they failed to mention that the entrecôte was from a fucking dinosaur. Beautiful sear and cooked to a perfect medium-rare, the steak sat atop roasted market vegetables - which included asparagus, arugula, snow peas, fresh green peas, Roma tomatoes, and radishes - and was accompanied by a parsnip purée and roasted rosemary potatoes (crusty on the outside and fluffy in), drizzled with a simple pan sauce."}
{"text":"Dans le cadre de Burger Week MTL, Baxo avait également capté notre attention avec son impressionnant Burger Hulk Smash qui se démarquait par sa galette d'onglet de buf haché de 13oz et son effiloché de cerf.   En plus du burger, l'assiette était composée de frites dorés a point et d'une savoureuse relish maison. La galette de viande juteuse, le cheddar fondant et l'effiloché de cerf se mariaient à la perfection.  Par contre, le bacon fait sur place laissait à désirer vu sa texture qui s'apparentait au beef jerky du dépanneur. On ose espérer qu'il ne s'agissait que d'une simple erreur de cuisson.  Comme le dit toujours Mr. Lew, la structure et le type de pain utilisé sont des éléments clés d'un burger. Dans le cas du Hulk Smash, le pain s'étirait sous la dent et la manière dont était disposé les ingrédients faisait en sorte qu'on se retrouvait à devoir prendre couteau fourchette pour le manger.  En gros, un burger délicieux et plein de potentiel qui mériterait ces quelques petites modifications."}
{"text":"We had a great first experience! It was during taste MTL, a week long festival showcasing montreal's great restaurants, and Baxo did not disappoint! Duck confit poutine, wild mushroom risotto, the tartar and rabbit were amazing! Great comfort food, fun staff who add to the cozy experience.   Definitely a restaurant to try! Nice drink selection, too :)"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I have ever been to. It took an hour and a half to get one round of drinks (4 people) and one appetizer. After 2 hours the food came. The pork was uncooked, the duck salad was without the duck and the halibut was excellent. We left the place hungry, disappointed and in disbelieve how expensive it was. I would highly recommend avoiding this restaurant at all cause."}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks ago. They ran out of burgers, ran out of 2 kinds of beer. Had to change my order completely. Service was slow.   Good music, decent food. cool waiters."}
