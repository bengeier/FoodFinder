{"text":"Horrible... fish is not fresh, every ingredient used is not well integrated and taste/flavor is mediocre at best... I am scared"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this place to open again after it closed for the season. Checked their website and it said they'd be back in August. Well, it's September so we drove by today and it's permanently closed! Too bad, the oysters were great."}
{"text":"We met up with some friends on a Thursday night and had a fantastic experience.  We are regulars to Pita Jungle in PHX and have been looking forward to trying this new place since it opened, but we don't get out that way very often.  I am glad we made out there. It is a nice place with ample outdoor seating. The food was quite good.  We tried several sushi rolls, some crab cakes, some chowder and some mussels.  We go out for sushi quite a bit and I thought that the rolls here were tasty and very fresh.  My girlfriend loved the chowder.  The bowl of mussels had great flavor and were served with some nice bread to sop up the sauce.   To top it all off, the service was fantastic.  Our server, Hayley, really took care of us and made sure we always had everything we needed.  We received a visit from the assistant manager Kevin a couple of times just to check on our meal, which I thought was a nice touch.  I believe that we will be making the drive out to Scottsdale many more times to enjoy this fine establishment.  Thanks for a great night."}
{"text":"Great Food:  Fresh,creative and friendly team .
We got Crab Cakes,Octopus,Salmon roll,Clam Chowder,Lobster roll,Ahi and yelowtail bowl with avocado,mango al green onion in a citrus vinagrete.
We have a bottle of white wine.
We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING seafood...as fresh as it gets. I chose Snapper (Colorado) and had the option of  selecting my own sides (broccolini and asparagus cassoulet). Apparently, they have a new menu with some fascinating looking options. Good wine list, pleasant atmosphere, very personable staff, chef, and owner. I will return!"}
{"text":"Came here early to celebrate my mother's birthday and started woth Happy Hour at the bar. Firstly, I can say tbe staff is very friendly and courteous. Ryan, at the bar was new to the restaurant  (3 days) but was very attentive. I tried one of the red wines but , even though it's early March, it was very warm...I can only imagine how hot it will become this summer since they don't have anywhere to keep it cool!

I started the evening with the tuna tartare and after reading the menu it looked like it would be filled with all sorts of textures and flavors. It came out in a nice large ball that was beautiful attractive but there were only 3 pieces of the toasted crostini. It would have been easier to finish have there been five. Presentation was beautiful with a quail egg centering the tunaon a long banana leaf in a shalliw bowl but the pieces of tuna were cut into a much larger dice than they should have been. It made it very difficult to actually put anything on the crostini because it wouldn't fit. Even the sun dried tomatoes and shallots should have been diced into smaller pieces so you could easily put them together on the crostini. It was slathered in evoo and was terribly bland. Definitely missing some sort of kick and/or flavor. Unfortunately, the anchovies provided the most pronounced flavor that overtook everything else on the plate. If it were up to me, I would definitely either dismiss the anchovies or make them into a much smaller size and much less of them.

Sourdough bread was served before the appetizers but  is was as  cold as the butter. A little heat would have made both more palatable. 

My brother ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer which took 40 minutes to show up to the table. Considering that three-quarters of the restaurant was empty, it made absolutely no sense.

I ordered whole Branzino with an asparagus /white bean cassoulet and basmati rice. While I'm accustomed to the bones in whole fish, my sister-in-law had a small bone caught in her throat and was in slight distress for a few moments. The fish was grilled with a white lemon butter sauce but the only flavor was from the char on the skin. None of the sauce could be found on the fish or plate. The rice was sticky and bland. A touch of salt would have done wonders. The cassoulet was also bland and watery.

The staff was great, especially Journey, who did her best serving mediocre food desperate for seasoning. 

At least the chocolate lava cake was rich and delicious. 

I'm hoping they work out their kitchen inadequacies, seasoning and timing. The concept is good but the execution is severely lacking."}
{"text":"I hate to give this restaurant only 3 stars because the food was excellent. However, dealing with slow service, wrong orders and incompetence was too much to overcome. A quick rundown: The hostess, bartender and staff were all very pleasant. We sat at the bar and ordered two drinks. Drinks never came. Bartender also handed us part of the menu and said she would be back with the other part, but forgot. When I finally got her attention and told her we didn't get our drinks, she apologized and rushed to get them, only to come back and say she was out of what we ordered. We then ordered appetizers which took entirely too long and the chowder was served luke warm. The food runner literally pushed my empty plate out of the way to put my calamari down, and walked away leaving the empty plate. My wife's dinner order was wrong and I was done with dinner by the time they fixed her order. The manager was very nice and offered to comp my wife's dinner; however, when we got the bill, my wife's dinner was still on there...and so was the drink that we never received. We paid the overcharged bill because I was frustrated and just wanted to leave. Too bad, because the food was great!"}
{"text":"Cant wait to give Grand Blue 5 Stars.  They are a great new addition to the neighborhood!  Food was A+ - they fell down a little on service, but management was all over it and did everything they could to make sure we walked out with a good experience.  We look forward to going back - this was just their 2nd night - great job!"}
{"text":"Love this place from fresh fish to decor! Really great atmosphere, healthy kids meals as well.
Fresh fish, steak, sandwiches, poke bowls ceviche and sushi!!! 
Bar is on point from cold sake, champagne, wine, beer and a mixologist to mix your drinks!!! This will be my new restaurant!!"}
{"text":"what a great new restaurant for 
the area.  some of the best crab cakes i have ever had and cerviche 
was very good going back to try the fresh fish 
we ate at the bar and the bar tender aiesha was very accomodating restaurant was a bit noisy but food made up for it"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! First I loved the decor and ambiance. Second the menu is so unique to this area, offering selections from around the world!  We had awesome tuna tartar for an appetizer which could have been my meal as well as octopus done to perfection. Wait staff was very attentive. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I cam here on Saturday night to celebrate my mom's birthday.  We were excited to try it and glad to see it so busy, which is usually a good sign for a new restaurant.  It still happened to be Happy Hour, so were were able to get some $1 oysters!  They were really good, very fresh and served with cocktail sauce, horseradish and a sweet mignotte, which was a nice option.  We also tried the clam chowder, and while not traditional, we all really liked it.  This is when things started to go downhill.  We had ordered the Tuna Tartare at the same time as our oysters, and 15 minutes after we finished the oysters it still had not arrived.  When it did arrive, it was great, and the restaurant did comp it....but it seemed odd that something that didn't need to be cooked took so long to come out.

When our main courses arrived, half of the side dishes came out cold, including two orders of fries, basmati rice, broccolini and we were missing a salad.  We sent the fries back but didn't bother mentioning the other items.  The shrimp, which we ordered grilled, were overdone and tough, and they didn't really have much flavor, even with the sauce.  My sister enjoyed the salmon on the plancha and the lobster roll was decent and a good portion, but we felt that all the choices of the sides made for a confused kitchen and worked against them in getting their timing down, hence the cold food.

There is some potential here, and maybe we just ordered wrong, but overall not that impressed.  When it came time for dessert, we ordered two (creme brulee and gelato) and we were done eating the creme brulee and the gelato hadn't even come out yet...which once again, seemed odd.

Maybe I will give them some time to work out the kinks and try it again...but as of right now, I am in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"The worst service....Tried it twice and both times had bad service and mixed up orders.  When we complained to the manager over the wait (30+ min after apps when the place was very empty), he argued with us that our order was just put in.  When they still mixed up our order he ignored us the rest of the night, walking by and not even looking our way.  Humorous but nothing ruins a meal like BAD SERVICE."}
{"text":"My girl friends and I each ordered a few dishes to share, the waitress didn't bother to bring us individual plates so we had to eat out of the soy sauce dish. The $22 lobster roll was super dry and taste less. We tried to order a few things on the menu and they are all out, for example, calamari, the uni , and the king crab. The mussel soup was not hot, just warm. Everything is just average and expensive for the price. The server is not very knowledgeable about Japanese food and seafood, she also isn't very attentive. Bad experience."}
{"text":"Update- Within an hr of my post, someone from grand blue responded....they obviously care and are trying hard. I will go give them a 2nd whirl in a few weeks for only this reason, great accountability!

I was really excited about this place, but it ended up mediocre, nothing memorable, nothing bad. 

Food- As it was the first time in, ordered a bunch of different stuff for a food tour.
 
Poke Bowl- huge portion, but it turns out the large portion was large pieces of chopped up fruits and vegetables, with minimal fish. If your looking for price per pound, then it's good, flavor and fish, then it's so so.
Ceviche- again, large portion and very pretty, nominal shrimp, lots of oversized fruits and veggies, ok flavor...price per pound good...but I came for flavor and seafoood.
Sashimi- blah tuna and salmon, skinny cut 
Grilled octopus- tasty, doused in garlic and butter, happy to see this on a menu that other seafood places don't serve
French fries- flavored and great.
Oysters- almost ordered them, I asked where the \"Paradise\" oysters were from...as the bay of origin and water temperature is telling about the flavor, waiter didn't know, they asked the oyster shucker/sushi maker, he didn't know, they asked a cook..he said \"Pacific\"...um, that's a big place...need to know product better. 

Ambience- interesting sound of middle eastern techno house and French brasserie. I was excited to go check out the large deli style glass cooler while anticipating some enticing seafood...there was 2 small red snapper in there.

I love seafood joints and the thought of a one-size-fits-all for seafood lovers...but left a bit bummed.

Service- 3 tables seated, probably 9 employees...struggled to keep water full. Server was really nice and sweet though. Looked like several employee only conversations were going on at bar, front door, and kitchen

Hopefully they work out the bugs! Their sister restaurants are great"}
{"text":"We weren't so impressed with our meals. I like that you can pick a fish, sauce and a preparation style and they make what you order. My fish filet and two sides were around $27. The portion was small.  I would say my fish didn't have much flavor although it was moist. The fries were ok, the side of okra and tomatoes just so so. My husband had a bowl that had a various mixture topped with a salmon filet. He said it was dry and flavorless. I really wanted to like this place because we are regular patrons to this shopping center and it was convenient to walk over for dinner. However, the food and slow service does not make this worth a return visit."}
{"text":"We happened upon Grand Blue on opening night!  The bartenders, staff, and owners are incredibly friendly, and the food is delicious!  The seafood is fresh and reasonably priced. We're thrilled to have Ocean Blue in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"This seafood restaurant lacks in knowledge quality product and most of all, execution.   Mgmt is questionablly operant.  Their price point deserves a better product.  Grand Blew should be avoided if you are expecting a good seafood meal"}
{"text":"Had such an amazing experience here! It seems like nothing in this location last, but I think this restaurant might!

The only criticism I have is that the menu is entirely too complicated, but we had the nicest waitress who took the time to explain everything to us. We came at an off hour, so I'm not sure that this would happen if it was busier. 

The food was GREAT! At the table, we ordered the wild shrimp with sides, a lobster roll, and a poke bowl. The shrimp were large and came 5 to a serving and you can order them cooked different ways and with different sauces. They were very good. One of the side dishes I tried was the lentils, they were SO good! I will definitely get these again. As for the lobster roll, it was nice too, not too much mayo and came on a brioche bun, yum! The poke bowl was definitely the star. You could order it with whatever you like in it, made to order. It was perfect! Nothing we tried was disappointing!

We all enjoyed our meal and will definitely be going back very soon to try some new dishes!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last night with Destiny as our server.  Really happy to have this restaurant in our neighborhood!  I get the Cioppino every time I go.  It is always good!"}
{"text":"Even though they were busy they still kept up with orders and plating. Our server and the (manager?) knew everything about the food so allergies weren't a problem. We had a great time and the high top seats on the side closest to Shea aren't too close together so it was nice being able to have a semi-intimate conversation."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered Mussels in Thai Curry sauce which was delicious and the sauce was addictive 
Also got ceviche and Salmon alla plancha all great food

Nice service Chef came out to check:)
Will be back for dinner"}
{"text":"The staff is great and welcoming! Iesha and Kevin stopped by and made sure everything was great and in order. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. Had the fish n chips w a side of chimichurri! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Grand Blue is an outstanding sea food restaurant!  The food, wait staff, indoor-outdoor seating area, long happy hour specials all combine to make it outstanding in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  You'll love it!

{"text":"My wife being a foodie is always on the lookout for new places so we have been eating here since they opened.   It has been fun to watch the menu evolve and the staff get settled in to a rhythm.   The menu flush with many great offerings most of which are of Mediterranean influence so some good stuff with yogurt and such.   These are the Pita Jungle people so if you have eaten there, you will love this as it has the same derivation.   Lots and lots of variety.

We have tired many of the dishes and have yet to be disappointed.   The Poke  Bowl I just saw going by yesterday looked amazing.  

The staff are awesome, friendly as it gets in N. Scottsdale  I can't recommend this place enough.   

Maybe Happy hour could be just a bit later, till 6 on Friday - Sun, but that is about it for critique."}
{"text":"The wild caught Scottish Salmon was amazing!  The side dishes and combinations were also top notch! The service and the concept is a welcome sight to the desert !"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Went with two of my friends and spent the better part of the evening there.  Fantastic selection of seafood dishes ranging from full meals to small plates. Our crew especially loved the \"build your own poke bowls.\" The decor was clean and sophisticated, the service spot on and the menu quite affordable. Equally fun for adults and kids. I especially appreciate that they have a fish counter where you can buy fresh fish and bring it home to cook. Very European in the middle of the Scottsdale.  I'll be back with more friends very soon. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING. A definite must try, and after that you'll be hooked. From the atmosphere and service, to the great food and wine selections, you honestly can't go wrong here. The Cioppino (seafood soup) was out of this world. The Poke Bowls are outstanding as well, customized to your liking. If you don't want seafood in your Poke Bowl... just ask! They will substitute beef or chicken :) We've sat at the bar more than half of the times we've been there and Iesha was our Bartender... She was on top of drinks and our food order... never has an empty glass. All in all... great place for friends, family, or just to stop by and have a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Great service and food!  Destiny took great care of us.  We were a little nervous about what to expect after reading a few of the reviews.  We had a GREAT experience.  Thank you Yelp for the calamari appetizer.  It was tender and seasoned just right.  My wife loved the ciopino.  The Caesar salad with fresh anchovy was a generous portion and very tasty.   It was loaded with seafood and shell fish.  My whole branzino was amazing.  Tender, flavorful and fell off the bone.  The broccolini with anchovy paste was great.  The only thing we did not care for was the saffron rice."}
{"text":"My new fav spot!! I've been in search of a Good Poke Bowl here and I've found it! Awesome menu! Great service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary this evening, our waitress destiny was very helpful and attentive. I had the wild caught shrimp with chimichuri and my husband had the branzino which was delicious! We also had a free yelp check in calamari which was tender and tasty, also had the grilled octopus which was ok. The seabeans that came with it were very good. Presentation was very good as well. My shrimp were tasty if just a tad overdone, not enough to send them back however. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying I really wanted to like it here... we came with our 2 girls ages 4 and 6 and the best part of the meal was the kids food. We got the tuna tartare which had so many onions that I can still taste them. In addition to that it was loaded with capers and I think sardines so my husband wouldn't eat it- there was very little tuna in it at all. Next we had the shrimp ceviche which had a very odd taste and what looked to he raw beets in it which made the texture displeasing. We had the mussels in white wine and there was no broth to dip the bread that accompanied it in and finally the only decent item was the crab cake. After 2 glasses of wine and 2 $5.99 kids meals our bill was $90.00 before tip and my husband wanted to pull through McDonalds on the way home because he was still hungry. My last comment is that the menu is confusing, are you a poke bar, sushi bar, raw bar among other items- maybe if you stuck to a few things you could do them well. I don't plan to return but if I did I would go with the fish and chips, other people seemed to be enjoying them. Good luck- hope this concept will make it!"}
{"text":"Exceptional venue... Another offering by Pita Jungle; so, of course it is delectable cuisine! I enjoyed the fish schwarma, with sea bass this evening! Enough to share as it comes with a choice of French fries, slaw or garden salad! As a singleton, I chose the bar and was not disappointed! Crystal was manning the bar and was simply delightful! I will be back SOON! Kudos to Pita Jungle for this \"fish house'!!!"}
{"text":"It was my girlfriend and puppies first time here. What a phenomenal experience! The whole staff was amazing, and the food was awesome. Originally we were going to stay for a sushi roll and a few drinks but ended up doubling down and staying an extra hour. If I could rate this any higher I would. We'll definitely be back again! Thank you for the great food and service!!"}
{"text":"Open kitchen, open seating area, lots of seafood selection at market price.  I had the sea bass which was not buttery melt in my mouth.  Had a unique taste that wasn't so great for me.  The okra, tomato and spices seemed to miss it for me.  The taste was lost, due to the spices and tomato.  The okra was a bit small as well, cut into halves.  The lentils weren't bad.

I also had some yellowtail sashimi which was pretty good, though I had to ask for chopsticks.   Guess I was supposed to eat it with my fork or hands."}
{"text":"Oysters were very good. I had the Snapper and it was prepared properly. Only issue is all the fish is 7 ounces, which means about 6 after cooking. Sides were good.  For a fish house I'd like to see a couple of soups available."}
{"text":"New place for me. Food was ok. I dined at the bar in this small place. The Barkeep ignored me for 15 minutes. Finally ordered, he took Someone else's roll to get me something fast. The Crab roll tasted like frozen meat.  The spicy tuna roll was so spicy that it could have been any kind of meat."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Tiffany was our waitress  very fun and friendly. 
The crab cakes were amazing. Haven't had them that good since we were in Friday Harbor Washington

The omg roll what a presentation. It was lit on fire and a great presentation! Tasted great too

The salmon roll was very good. The lemon on Top added a great fresh taste 

My favorite the turtle roll. The presentation was awesome. Perfect amount of spice and the avocado added a great flavor. 

Will definitely be back. Hope we get Tiffany again."}
{"text":"OMG.  Please come back.  It was a great place for fish oysters sushi and good French fries!"}
{"text":"When you walk in the decor is nice and bright. I was thinking this was a seafood place I didn't get why theirs was a deer on the wall. And I didn't like the paper they used as table clothes. This is not hot n juicy lol. 

I judge most restaurants based off the bread they serve. Before we got the food we ordered the waiter gave us a basket of bread and butter. Let me tell you, that thing was so stale. lol Texas Roadhouse is cheap but their dinner rolls and butter spread are amazing in comparison. 

Anyways we ordered the cipriano soup, oysters, tuna tar tar, crab cakes, salmon sashimi, and creams brûlée. The soup was good- you don't get very much of it though. Oysters were awesome, some were kinda tiny but that's fine. Crab cakes were good and salmon was the best ! It was so buttery and smooth. I just was confused at the menu if I wanted sushi I would've gone to a Japanese restaurant. I was expecting more of a Boston fish market type of seafood. 

Service was good, food came out Pretty speedy. Although our waiter forgot to put in two of our orders lol. 

I might come back to try the lobster rolls but other than that nothing caught my attention."}
{"text":"Our office decided to go here for our annual Thanksgiving lunch and boy did we make the right decision!

The Grand Blue has only been open for a few weeks, but it feels like they've been doing it forever and we certainly didn't experience any new restaurant issues. 

The atmosphere is nice and open with lots of light and marine colors. It's nothing like those old oak and dark wood seafood restaurants that still feel like the 1980's. There's a bar that opens to both the inside and the front patio. They have an open kitchen along with a raw bar. Lots of tables inside and on the patio. In fact, if it weren't located next to a parking lot, I might have thought we were overlook the ocean.

The menu has a lot of options, but in some ways it's similar to the owners other properties (Pita Jungle) in that you can really customize your meal.

Two of the interesting items are the Custom Blue Zone and the poke bowl. In both cases you select your proteins from the various fish and seafood, add-ins such as rice or vegetables, style of cooking and sauces. It's a great way to customize your meal for what you like.

Additionally, my coworkers tried the crab cakes, fish and chips, and grilled octopus and I had the cioppino, which is a fish stew. All of us were extremely happy with our meals.

I also noticed that they had protein plates which would be perfect for anyone on a paleo or low-carb diet and they have a full sushi selection. Also, if you don't like seafood they even have steak or burgers!

As for the service, it was excellent. Our server did a great job of explaining the menu and answering all out questions. She was also there when we needed her during the meal. We even had both the chef and the manager visit our table to see how we were doing.

The Grand Blue is a great new addition to the Valley and one that I hope will succeed and grow. I know that I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm torn by this place. I'm always down for more affordable seafood options that aren't Red Lobster - a lot of the good ones are a good drive away from North Scottsdale if you aren't willing to pay Ocean Club pricing.

In the Shea 14 area, this place had a lot of promise. At first the menu didn't seem to have any focus outside seafood: you got poke, sushi, grilled fish, fish and chips among other things. It's hard to get just one of those right let alone everything. 

So I was surprised when the meal went over pretty well. Table service with a great casual vibe to it. And pretty much everything was satisfying from the calamari to the sashimi. Everything tasted fresh when I dined over spring - which is my concern for this place. With such a great breadth in the menu, the cost of ordering everything without a steady flow of customers may be hitting the restaurant hard. When we went on a weekend dinner it was still relatively empty.

Website still says seasonal closing, but I hope what Lassie A. reports isn't true, and they're refining their menu. The flavors are definitely worth staying in the area, and I wish them the best."}
{"text":"Fabulous fresh seafood! Our Bartender Ramone was extremely knowledgeable with the menu and made excellent recommendations! We started with the shrimp and hummus, very good. The crab cakes, cioppino and clam chowder were excellent! Prices are amazing! Owner and chef present in dining room! One of the best new restaurants in this area in many years!"}
{"text":"Not Impressed with Grand Blue!!!  This will be another failure in this location, just like Squid Ink, Taco Huas and Blue Burrito.  I was hoping to finally have a great happy hour to go to and a great neighborhood gem.

No attention to detail.  They have several missed spelled words on the menu.  If they cant get this small detail right how much effort will they put into their recipes. Ever heard of Spell Check?

Service was absolutely terrible.  Waitress didn't know anything about the menu. Slow to get us drinks and with a disappointing pour of wine.  We ordered appetizers and they finally arrived when we were on our last bites of our main dish.

Wife ordered the cioppino, only find half the clams not to be cooked and not opened. We mentioned this to our waitress.  They did bring us another dish with more clams and still had the same problem. You think they would have paid more attention the second time around.

My fish and chips was soggy.  Although the fish is self was very good the batter was not and had zero crunch factor.

When we got our appetizer (LATE) the sushi roll could be compared to gas station sushi.  We also ordered Shrimp cocktail.  It took forever and when it arrived there was one shrimp.  I guess I didn't see the fine print that you had to order by number of shrimp you want.

The menu is confusing, the Fish Comptoir concept is confusing.  They have a lot of education to do to help customers understand their restaurant concept. Don't bother to look at the website or you will be even more confused. 

So disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is so fresh, the decorations and atmosphere are so relaxing. And the staff have genuine smiles, so friendly."}
{"text":"If you have been searching for a place to indulge in a seafood experience, Grand Blue knocks it out of the park!!!   Finally, a place (In AZ, no less) that delivers the freshest seafood(Mussels, Poke, Branzino!,) Amazing drinks(Wine Selection a White Hibiscus Tea and Coffee Sensational!

The dishes have such amazing flavors yet never overpower the fish-wish others could learn from these guys.

I'm a tough critic, and these guys put the food, service, and atmo together perfectly.  

My new Favorite Spot!"}
{"text":"First, the happy hour goes to 6.30! First again, the food was great!! Spicy tuna roll is super fresh, GB salad is light and full of peppers, radish etc. I had the snapper white wine lemon butter, plancha style. Best fish I have had in a long time. Drinks on happy hour so pricing was so reasonable. Service was also quick and got us out to movies at Shea 14 on time. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not a seafood person at all so I was hesitant to come try this place out; saw here was non seafood choices on the menu so I was willing to try it out. There was 7 in our group and we were seated right away, I'm sure that's going to change quickly because this place is Awesome! 

I got the burger and it was seriously the best burger I have had period. Great flavor no mayo, mustard, ketchup needed. How does a seafood place have the best burger? 

The rest of the party ordered seafood dishes. The fish and chips got a thumbs up from my group. Big pieces of fish that were devoured quickly. 

Husband had crab cake and chowder. The Chowder had salmon in it; he loved it. Crab cake was good sized and had big chunks of crab. 

Two others in the party order the custom blue. You select your choice of fish or seafood;  then how you want it prepared;  your sauce; and 2 side dishes. One had the rockfish and the other had the salmon. Both plates were nearly licked clean. 

Prices are very reasonable. Our total for 7 was just over $100; the most expensive entree out group ordered was $22. 

Staff was very friendly and explained the menu and how items were prepared. The owners were there tonight and stopped by to ask how our meal was. 

The restaurant itself is beautiful; indoor and outdoor seating additionally there's  a large indoor and outdoor bar. 

There are so many choices on the menu you could eat here several times and still have something different; from fish and chips to sushi everyone will find something they like on the menu. 

Overall a wonderful place to have some delicious food even if you don't do seafood. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Nice patio,  really friendly service.  Food is a little pricey to be a regular place for us.  Fish and chips were nice.  Seafood stew was a little oily heavy.   Will try again some day when the mood strikes."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to Scottsdale! The food is very good, lots of excellent fresh seafood. The shrimp appetizer was very good and flavorful. My sister loved the grilled  octopus. The poke bowl was very good, you get to choose the protein, base, veggies and sauce. I'll definitely be back often."}
{"text":"Good food, but questionable service. Poki bowls were good but ask for sauce on the side, comes with too much. Service and flow was awkward. Meals all came out at different times, took cocktail off the table with last few sips still in glass. Manager/chef came to ask how things were and when concerns were expressed he seemed to brush them off.  Too bad first experience was poor at what could be a trendy new place."}
{"text":"Great spot!!! Whether you bring kids or come on a date. The staff are all so very personal, professional and pleasant. The chef is also always visible and socially sweet to the guests. Foods great! Many options whether you want lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Grand Blue, but it won't be my last! Wonderful fresh fish- and the Happy hour deals are phenomenal... my $5 glass if Malbec was great. The Mediterranean tuna tartar was delicious! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to a great meal because we love Pita Jungle. We were sadly disappointed. Everything about this place is chaos. Our poor waitress was quite harried and you could feel the disorganization of the place.  She said a number of employees had called out, and the restaurant was short staffed. You could tell the place is poorly managed. We found the menu to be just too big. Half of the menu seemed to fit better as a casual, order at the counter type of place, and the other items just didn't fit. The Grand Blue needs to decide who they are, narrow down the menu, and get organized.
We waited quite a while for anyone to come to our table. We requested water, were brought a bottle of water, but no glasses. Finally our waitress came over, we ordered wine and cocktails and while we had her attention, we ordered dinner but made it clear we wanted to relax with our drinks first.  She said the bar was backed up, and asked for our patience. 
There were 4 of us having dinner. 3 of us decided to keep it simple and order the design yourself poke bowl. We all found the bowls to be lackluster. The pieces of fish were diced, not cubed and were too small and tasteless. The 4th person in our party ordered a cup of soup and a fish sandwich. Also not much flavor in either. 
Kind of stunning that the people behind Pita Jungle could be part of such a miss."}
{"text":"OMG, I am so glad we ended up at this place.  It was amazing.  Get got there about 5 minutes before the end of HH and we were able to order a few items from the HH menu.  We had the California roll, the tuna roll as well as 2 mini shrimp rolls and a humus with shrimp on toast (don't remember the name).  We also had a couple of cocktails, I had the Grand Mule and my husband had the sparkling Margarita. Till and Crystal were very attentive bartenders.  We were seated at the bar and saw that the lady next to us got a Lobster roll that look amazing.  I was in my chatty Cathy mode so we started talking, she was originally from NY and lives super close to us (way north Scottsdale).  She kept saying that the lobster roll was to die for and her husband's clam chowder was delicious.  I was salivating by now, so I ended up ordering a lobster roll also.  It was delicious!  I was so hungry and excited to eat this deliciousness that I forgot to take pictures. For lunch they have the same stuff and also poke bowls.   I will come back, definitely.  They explained to us that for the poke bowls, you select what you want in them by marking a little tally like at the sushi places and then relax at your table, maybe with a nice cocktail.  The seafood  all tastes so fresh, since it is flown in daily.  While we were there we texted out friends a platter of oysters that the patrons next to us were having.  They said that it was delicious and that they had been there two days earlier.  I am rambling, but I am so excited about this place, I only wish it was closer to me.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for happy hour and once for dinner. Happy hour experiences were good - ordered raw items and sat at the bar. Fresh and good - service out of the kitchen was slow but they acknowledged it. Seemed to be a bit of a cluster there. Dinner on the other hand was kind of a nightmare. Server less than engaged and disappeared for long spans. Three different menus that require explanation - which was done rather apathetically. Food, when finally delivered was meh - this plancha prep they encourage - that the server said was great and ensures the fish is moist and juicy, was not that at all. We got super dry and tough to eat. Maybe it was the cook on that particular day - but it wasn't at all good. The sides - bland and not as advertised. Saffron rice was only in name and color; dry, flavorless, yellow tinted nothing. A chopped salad that isn't - it's a pull-apart iceberg plate with chopped cucumbers and evo. Def not a chopped - but it was the best item in that it was fresh and edible.

The table next to us seemed to have had the same experience as they called us over when we left to see if they were alone in their disappointment and poor service.

So, go for happy hour if you are near and within their unusual time frame. Dinner - ehh, I'd pass. Just doesn't come together and pricey for what you get. Much better options out there. I hear this is affiliated with pita jungle, which was an encouraging thing, but it in no way holds up in terms of service quality, flavors/cooking craft or value. Has potential but needs work and a stronger management hand to pull things together I think."}
{"text":"Already knowing it's part of Pita Jungle, I didn't doubt my experience. This place and its menu makes me want to opt for being a mermaid. Spacious seating from the lovely patio to the bar chairs and quaint tables with fresh flowers. A bit loud due to echoing but love the decor and vibe just really inviting and energetic. I'm in love just looking at the walls. Definitely a HH spot! 

I really wanted the poke bowl or lobster roll but under the weather, I opted for the chowder. Generous with bacon and the cheesy bread. The shrimp and chips is ridiculously oversized packing the right crunch. Accidentally ordered a steak with chimichurri sauce. Let's just say it's Ruth's Chris on a plate but a fraction of the cost. 

Staff is so amazing and friendly. Management is hands down stellar. My order had a misstep but they apologized profusely and thoughtfully offered to fix the error. You have my affection and attention repeatedly. I can't wait to update this after I create my own poke bowl and partake in the oysters."}
{"text":"When reading this please understand that they are still getting the kinks out as they have not yet had their Grand Opening...

We arrived during happy hour. One of the few places where wine during happy hour was less expensive than beer!

We created our own shrimp cocktail by ordering large prawns and cocktail sauce. The cocktail sauce was a bit thin and as a result was a bit difficult to scoop. It was however tasty.

One page of the menu was dedicated to creating a single meal:
Multiple protein choices, vegi choices etc.
We were told the menu changes daily so too much detail on the menu may be of no value.

We each ordered different things to try and taste as much as possible.
Both fish portions were a bit small compared to Bluewater Grill.
We had two vegi choices. 
My first choice was asparagus  and something I would consider a casserole base. With asparagus as the first ingredient I expected more than a garnish.

Our waitress was VERY new and eager to help but did not know the menu. I give her an E for effort...

In summary, the beer prices were a bit high for happy hour. The wine prices were great.
The fish portions were a bit on the small side.
We did not partake of the sushi bar.

Total expense with tip for two: $100.00

All in all they have a few kinks to work out but the restaurant shows promise!"}
{"text":"It started when we walked in the door. Receptionist met us with a big smile and thanked us for coming to dine with them. Waitress was outstanding. Our first time here and she took her time to explain the menu. A lot of selections and she made our decisions easy for us. Any questions we had were answered and never felt rushed. 
Food was outstanding. My wife had a never ending bowl of muscles in an excellent sauce and the bread service complimented her meal. We split the smoked eggplant appetizer...excellent. I had the ahi tuna poke bowl which was superb. The ahi tuna was seared perfectly. 
Only disappointment was no Hendricks gin or I would have had a martini. 
Excellent service and food. Thanked the receptionist on the way out for a wonderful evening and she gave me a big hug. 
Great dining experience and looking forward to returning to try something new. Just a wonderful evening for my wife and myself."}
{"text":"I met three other ladies for lunch at the Grand Blue this week and had a good experience.  Our server was personable, the space was bright and airy and the food was pretty good.  My group enjoyed the hummus with shrimp, a poke bowl, the chicken sandwich and the crab cakes.  It was pretty pricey for lunch, so beware...hopefully they'll come up with a reasonable lunch menu in the future."}
{"text":"This establishment is one of the best in The Valley! From the hostess, the server and the food - it is all amazing. Our server Spencer was wonderful and made the experience for us very memorable! We will definitely be back to experience all the great food and service!"}
{"text":"We have been to Grand Blue twice. Each time the service was great and the food quality well above par. Fair wine prices will keep us coming back (Love the Muscadet)  We tried most of the happy hour apps and had Wahoo (2x it was that good) Scallops (5 large scallops)  and Orange Roughy. All were great but everyone agreed the Wahoo was best.
The mussels servings (had them on both visits) were generous, quality great (plump and fresh tasting) and the Thai sauce is delicious. I agree with another review that the bread was dried out rock hard though it softened when dipped in the sauce. The cassoulet of beans and chanterelles and the broccoli rabe are great sides.  We misunderstood the menu pricing on the Lentils and rice (marked $4 on the menu) which are included at NC with the entree ... we should have asked, but now we know. I should note that the entree includes 2 very generous sides.   One last addition the deserts are also generous and Great We had both the Lavender creme brulee and the Matcha tea Panna Cotta (our fav because it was not too sweet)  This place should be on your must try list."}
{"text":"Excellent menu great fish options. Good wine, reasonable! Oysters are fresh and good quality! Salmon is from New Zealand Try it u will like it!"}
{"text":"Try it .. you'll love it !!! Can not wait to go back !!! We had build your own poke, tuna roll, tuna hand roll, Barramundi (cooked perfectly) . Remone took amazing care of us.. love it...."}
{"text":"Amazing place. I came with my oh so beautiful wife for dinner on a random Wednesday in March. This is a new place that specializes in seafood. It is wonderful. 

We started with a few items from the happy hour. Everything from the happy hour menu is a small plate of 2 items. We had a white bean hummus with shrimp and the second was a crab cake. The crab cakes was just ok. To be honest we felt that they really aren't worth the money.

Our main courses were fish and chips and I had a fresh fish from their dinner menu. The latter is fresh fish at market price. I had the Monk fish plancha style which was quite nice. The real standout was the fish and chips. My lovely wife is a fish and chips expert and she said it was \"top 3\" she had ever tasted. I also thought is was wonderful when I tried it. 

The bread basket came with locally baked sour dough and butter. Really great! We also tried a sushi roll, the OMG. Very nice indeed. 

We had 2 sides. The tomato and okra and the jasmine rice. Both were underwhelming. 

Service was 5/5. Food was 4.5/5. Overall we give it 5/5. We will be returning for the fish and chips alone for sure."}
{"text":"Took my grandson for lunch today and we were both disappointed.  Cioppino came with two perfectly cooked shrimp, some unknown small pieces of fish, two mussels with the smallest insides ever and one clam which had not opened.  The calamari appetizer tasted excellent and would have been better served other than room temperature.  My grandson's swordfish was cooked well but again not hot.
The problem with the temperature of the food was that the wait staff seemed overworked and we were left waiting while our food was up on the counter."}
{"text":"Grand Blue is a casual mostly healthy focused globally inspired Seafood Restaurant. They offer wait service with a full bar and indoor or outdoor dining. The interior is open and airy that's modern and classic with an open kitchen. They serve sushi, seafood soups, seafood build your own bowls, fish reuben sandwiches, fish shawarma, fish build your own platters with interesting sides called CBZ or Custom Blue Zone and much more.

Unlike other reviewers I thought the menu was easy to navigate but it was easy to miss the build your own bowls ($12.) because I focused on the main menu page. 

Our server was very friendly and helpful. I had a few questions about the side dishes and she whipped out cheat sheets that contained all the ingredients of everything in the dishes and was able to answer my questions.

I decided to try a fish platter (Custom Blue Zone). On my visit I had maybe EIGHT choices of fish with different prices. On the day I went the prices ran between $15-$22. I picked how I wanted the fish prepared, the sauce and two sides. I got Plancha Grilled KING Salmon with Spicy Tahini Sauce and for my sides Broccolini with Anchovy Sauce and White Bean Cassoulet with Asparagus and Chanterelle Mushrooms. ($22)

The Fish was cooked to perfection and I had no idea that Tahini would pair so well with salmon. To me is wasn't very spicy but it was very tasty. The Broccolini was a perfect tender crisp and was good with the Anchovy Sauce. The Cassoulet was mild tasting. I guess that was just right because nothing over powered anything and I was able to taste the Chanterelles.

My husband tried a shrimp platter. The Shrimp were cooked perfect and the Chimichurri Sauce was Good Tasting but might be Non-Traditional. He also had the same Cassoulet I had and tried the Eggplant with Pepper Pico and it came with a Chunk of Roll. I figure the eggplant was meant to be a spread for the bread. The eggplant was cooked nicely. I kinda wanted to add tahini and lemon to it...it made me crave baba ghanoush.

The manager checked on us and asked us how everything was and latter the Chef also asked us how everything was. I did tell the Chef I thought that something needed a tweak and not only did he listen he actually wrote down what I said. How COOL is That!

I do really like this concept. Potions are large. Expensive Ingredients are used. Mostly healthy foods are served. Some things have a global twist to them. Prices are LOW for what they are serving. Most restaurants serve Bronzino for $30... here this fish ran $22.  King Salmon is also very expensive and usually runs $30. a LB at AJ's. Chanterelles are very $$$$ I hope that Grand Blue is successful and gets expand to other locations.

This restaurant is very unique and serves fresh healthy fish meals that's reasonably priced. 

Tons of potential here. At the time of this review (11-20-16) this restaurant is very new and they might be still finding their way.

If you like Fish you might want to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"First visit.  Checked out HH - which is 3-5 pm ONLY at the bar on Fri/Sat.  Great values ($20) on some HH wines by the bottle.  But SO many service/food prep hiccups...  As someone who worked in the industry - it was very frustrating to observe/experience so many poorly trained workers and basic service errors being tolerated.  Upon exit it felt like we had been to a place being run by kids who believed there was no supervising adult around.  (While the cat's away...)

Walked in at 4:30 pm on a Friday.  Seven female waitresses/workers standing around socializing in two groups:  one group near the bar area closest to the entrance where one worker was eating (most left when we sat down), and another group standing in a circle somewhere to our left.  (Meanwhile somebody else was being trained on the patio by I presume a manager).  Nobody could be bothered to notice CUSTOMERS had walked in the door.  We sat ourselves.  Barmaid walked behind the counter handed us several pages of menus and explained how to order - she never mentioned Happy Hour - which we eventually figured out on our own...  Friday.  4:30 pm.

Started with mussels ($8 at HH for a decent - sized pot - garlicky and good).  Food arrived.  Barmaid did not provide us plates, napkins, silverware.  We asked someone passing by for such.  She asked barmaid.  Barmaid said she did not yet have 'time' to stock her area with things like plates...  (Well - maybe your standing around gabbing outside your area when we first arrived instead of prepping your station had something to do with that?).  Eventually we got plates.  Then had to ask AGAIN to get napkin/flatware set-ups.  Meanwhile workers wandered in/out of the bar area while barmaid turned back on us to do her sidework.  Busboy spent couple of minutes deciding where to store his cigarettes back there.  Waitress shoved her purse first in one place and then another... (Eventually when we left 30 minutes later that waitress was seated alone on the patio with a drink while playing with her smartphone).

Ordered a dozen oysters - only eleven served to us - though we pointed out the kitchen error and they brought out a couple of more, which was nice.  Later ordered some sushi - which was first brought to the wrong table before being delivered to us.  And of course our barmaid did not provide, until after our sushi arrived and we asked for such, basic things like a soy sauce dish and chop sticks.  Look, sweetheart, when somebody in your station orders food - how about thinking IN ADVANCE what might be needed.  Plates?  Napkins?  Soy dish for sushi??  Your job (IMHO) is more than just putting in orders and then letting the chips fall where they may...  How about a little planning ahead and providing things you KNOW your clients will need BEFORE their food actually arrives and is sitting in front of them???

Note the bar counter space is a pretty tight space - making it all the more frustrating that our barmaid (and others passing by) ignored our dirty dishes.  At first we resorted to shoving them down the bar - where at one later point a newly arriving customer who wanted to sit had to pick them up and hand them to the clueless barmaid.  Eventually I figured out if I shoved our empties all the way to the edge of the bar so they crowded her space near the glass froster - she would clear them...

Hope management kicks some folks in the butt - as in the end it is up to MANAGEMENT to hire and train folks who do the job right.  So far (service-wise) - not so good..."}
{"text":"Came for HH, only had the oysters on 1/2 she'll and bucket of clams. Both were excellent.
Service from bartenders were great.
Will need to come back for a full meal"}
{"text":"So this one is a tough one for me as I think this place is really about a 3 overall but a 4 for happy hour it's one of those places where I'd love to be able to give a 3.5 score but fall just short of being able to round up since Happy Hour isn't all day. 

I came here the other night for a celebratory dinner for my girlfriend getting a promotion and was really excited about all the good things I had been hearing. We started off with some of the happy hour options which were really good deals, I mean blue point oysters for $1 whats not great about that? So I had some oysters which had a great little asian minionette, she had a couple shrimp and we did some sushi which we were told would take awhile from the start (at this point the patio is mostly full but we are one of 2 tables inside). The rolls were good with fresh fish and crab for the california roll. I also ordered a poke bowl wish tuna and salmon which was actually very good and a lot larger than expected for the price. Sam isn't a big fan of raw fish and she really liked both the tuna and the salmon which were melt in your mouth good. We did have an issue where the cali roll was ordered with soy paper and we had to send it back when it didn't come with it.

We also ordered some cocktails. The old fashioned I got was good but not great, one thing that stood out was the first time it didn't have an orange the second time it did, need to work on consistency on that.

Everything was going pretty well to this point but when the entrees came around is when things started to slip a bit (yes we ordered entrees to we over did it). We ordered the scallops plancha style with the white wine lemon butter. These were very well cooked and very tasty. We also got the lobster roll which while filled with lobster was unimpressive as they used some sort of aioli as opposed to regular mayo (not indicated on the menu) and it just didn't work. The sides were where the real disappointment was. The okra and tomato sauce was bland and underwhelming it was like some okra in an off the shelf tomato sauce. The asparagus and white bean was also very bland and didn't really have much asparagus.

The other issue I had was pacing of the meal which seemed a bit rushed once the food started coming probably due to the slow down on sushi/raw bar versus the kitchen. They are still pretty new so have time to figure that out. I also think the inside tables feel a bit cramped and since they had the patio doors open and it was cold night it was a bit chilly inside and I'm usually hot.

Like I said to open the review the happy hour is great especially if you have the time to wait if they get behind on the raw/sushi bar as the prices are more than fair. The poke bowl is also a solid value. The entree courses and sides fall short of expectations especially for the price point (scallops were 30ish).

If you are able to stop for happy hour or a poke bowl by all means go for it. If you are stopping for dinner I'd plan accordingly and try some different sides. I will say the fish was very fresh along with the oysters and scallops. That to me is big for a place like this. The rest of the stuff can be improved on the core components of a seafood restaurant is the fish quality and that is there."}
{"text":"I think I saw my waitress twice tonight. Disappeared and seemed very confused. She didn't seem to know what was on the menu, and had attitude. Wish this place went back to being Blue Burrito ):
The waitress seemed to be able to only manage one thing at a time. Gave it two stars originally but due to having to wait 10 minutes to get our servers attention it's going down to 1."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant located at Shea/Scottsdale.  We came in for HH.  Great drink specials ($5 wine and $2 off cocktails).  The Oysters were $1 each.  The crab cakes were small, but not bad for $3.  The sushi was very fresh and tasted great.  It helped each roll was only $3.  The clam chowder was good and full of flavor.  That was enough to fill me up.  We also got a poke bowl, which was also very good.  The atmosphere was cool and the bartenders were great."}
{"text":"I read about The Grand Blue on AZ Central and was really excited to try it. We went last night, everything looked promising and I hope to return once it is more established. To start we had two sushi rolls off the Happy Hour menu; Spicy Salmon and Spicy tuna. Pretty standard. We also ordered a 1/2 dozen oysters which were awesome. 

I was slightly surprised that when we ordered 1/2 dozen oysters that we were weren't asked which ones we would like, as if you wander into the restaurant and look at the rawbar there were 3 or 4 to choose from. Nonetheless still good. 

By the way a Happy Hour that lasts till 6:30pm is pretty fantastic in itself.

My husband had the fish and chips which we all tried, pretty bland. Our daughter choose grilled shrimp in lemon sauce which she loved. My sister and I each had a poke bowl, which were both great. The house sauce is pretty good. After we we were done eating, I asked two staff what the person next to us was eating, neither knew and one said she would come back and let us know. She never did. Whatever it was looked amazing, but at this point we will never know.  I wish someone would have taken the time to explain part of the menu to us or at least told us what fish was available. There is an option to choose, your fish, but it didn't read as if all the fish was available everyday. You select from available seasoning and how you would like prepared, we are not foodies, we don't know what plancha means. So we skipped that whole part of the menu.  So we may be back once, I will follow other reviews and see what others recommend."}
{"text":"I'm very excited about this place, being a seafood lover. Went for lunch and decided on the poke bowl. Really good, you pick a couple seafood, five veggies and sauce for $12. It was a big bowl, there was a lot of rice but also a good amount of veggies and the fish was very fresh. I love the menu, you should take a look, there are so many different things that I would get. The happy hour from 3 to 6:30 looked awesome, great prices. Hopefully this spot will make it, being a pita jungle restaurant will certainly help.
Needless to say, I will be back."}
{"text":"I know it is easy to be skeptical about seafood in the desert, but this place delivers. We stopped by for a late lunch and decided to just share a few small plates. We had the white bean hummus with wild shrimp provencal, the grand blue crab cake, the chanterelle asparagus white bean cassoulet, and a spicy tuna roll. The crab cakes were some of the best I ever had, full of beautiful lump crab and barely any filler. They came with a delicious sauce that I didn't even use because the crab cakes were already so delicious and flavorful. The shrimp was large, tender and well cooked and the hummus was a little spicy and a great accompaniment to the shrimp. The cassoulet was yummy but we were sort of wishing we'd skipped it and ordered another seafood dish. Spicy tuna roll was fresh and tasty. Our server was so nice and helpful! We sat on the patio and had a lovely, flawless lunch experience. We can't want to go back and try the lobster roll, the tuna tartar and a few items from the fresh fish selection. (I might suggest adding some descriptions of your specialty sushi rolls on the menu, because now that I see some pics of those rolls I wish I had tried some.)"}
{"text":"My father and I were looking for a few seafood options in Scottsdale, and there are many. After searching my trusting app Yelp, I found this one located in a strip mall around Shea and Scottsdale road.

The place has a cool feel to it when you walk in, and although it was raining, the outdoor area could definitely be cool on a early summer night for a beer or two. 

First thing when we got there was that the server took a while to get to our table, and considering the prices it probably in my opinion should have been faster. They ran out of several fish options at 6pm, and obviously they were the ones we were looking at. 

Nevertheless we tried a dozen oysters each and they had 3 different varieties. Pretty good selection and we enjoyed them. I asked for a beer pairing for them and the server had a tough time suggesting so I just went with an orange wit. 

For the main course my dad had a shrimp dish that was pretty simple and found on the lighter options part of the menu. I went with the mahi, not bad."}
{"text":"Great concept, very nice patio, awesome happy hour menu, very friendly service. We will definitely be back to try everything."}
{"text":"I loved eating there the one time I went but upon going back i found out they have changed their hours and not updated it to yelp  Which really suck sucks because I drove 30 minutes from chandler for shrimp and fries (which are great) to find them closed. So be warned they don't open till 3."}
{"text":"OK ....I'm big on Price/Value and this place has it.
Oysters for $1 during Happy Hour - Give me 4 - Dang they were super good and I should have gotten 12...Seabass sourced from Greece - Lemon Butter- lentils - rice - I finished Everything.  $5 per glass wine with healthy pours ?.....now I'm probably coming back tomorrow nite.  I'm sitting here and just finished a Great Meal and this Review."}
{"text":"Finally Fresh Seafood served in casual atmosphere with top notch service in Scottsdale. Being a transplant from California's central coast and having owned seafood  restaurants for  25 years I have been lost since moving to az.  It's only their opening night but this shows a lot of promise. Chowder  excellent, oysters fresh and octopus ala plancha on its way. And a very nice, crisp Cakebread chard. Life is good. Thank you.  Came back again. Had the sea scallops cooked on the plancha. Amazing really amazing."}
{"text":"Great experience.  HH oysters were fresh and briny.  Restaurant had the seafood briny scent and No \"fishy\" smell.  Service was attentive, all servers pleasant.  Had the lobster roll.  Really good and not drowning in mayo.  Unfortunately, the fries were excellent!  Salad was crisp with a light vinaigrette.  Only complaint is that tables are a little too close together.  We will be back!  A lot of other items to try."}
{"text":"I would really love to give praise.. But this review will not be a happy one. 

I love pita jungle!.. Seriously I'm a two times a month type girl. When heading to pita jungle i noticed the new restaurants that's by the same owners.. I thought to myself, self- this is heaven. 

I ordered the crab cakes which came on bread crackers.. 

Chard/black eye peas

Salmon sushi rolls. 

Ok, so the good.. If your a fish place and you mess up on basic rolls, i will send it back and never visit again! But it was good. So for that thank you.

The crabcakes are just wrong.  First.. They looked like flattened crab strips pushed togather in a cheap way to make it appear your getting a crab cake. ( even on happy hour..no) they were bland and not fluffy or juicy. Also not breaded etc. Just pushed togather crab,flattened .. Idk. Then topped on a cracked bread type thing, that was overly buttered and salty. No. Just no. 

The chard and black eyed peas.. Under seasoned! Seriously your making two very ethnic items and putting them togather.. Bring on the seasoning. It was just ok.

The menu was put togather very oddly and confusing. Also..price the items , alllll the items . Seriously. Your servicing an upscale crowd fish we expect a higher price than pita jungle, don't have us asking the waitress because often the prices doesn't suit the meal.

A fish place also should have more fish options.. Ijs. Its just a confusing menu and concept. 

The bartender that was talking about herself non stop that just got married and husband drives as a chauffeur.. Honey stop. We are here to enjoy the food, not your life. No, i dont want your husbands card..thats what Lyft is for. #stopit

So- i hope a few things changes as of now i must stick with pita jungle."}
{"text":"I know this place is new. So they really don't have their act together yet. But the menu does not seem well thought out. It's confusing!  Nice decor, willing but not well trained servers. They seem to be running around like chickens without heads.  Food is ok.Good Mussels,good Poke bowls.        The Tartares are fresh and very good quality, but they were very salty.      The Ceviches were  spicy due to all the jalapeños on them.The quality is there at this inviting restaurant. They will succeed.


Things are somewhat better. Serving toasted bread now with Mussels.       Oysters are tasty. But the Salmon Tartare is so salty and ruins the dish. We will be back, but will not order that. Please check with your Chef!                      Please don't re-open. You blew it. Stick to Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"We went out for date night and didn't know where to go and decided to drive around till something looked good. We ended up here and decided to try it! The customer service was great ! I think we talked to everyone from the busser to the manager to the bartender. Everyone was so nice and friendly. We had at least 2 servers that weren't our server ask us how everything was! That is UNHEARD of! We ordered a roll and a poke bowl. Unfortunately they were so backed up on the poke bowls and it would have taken close to a hour for us to get it. The manager Scott personally came up to tell us this and offered to comp whatever we were ordering! We will definitely will come back here!!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try The Grand Blue for a while now- and was finally able to make it a couple weeks ago. Being a Pita Jungle enthusiast (official title lol!) I knew it was going to be a treat. We arrived around 8pm and were seated quickly on the patio near a heater. Our server was quick and friendly when greeting us and seemed knowledgeable about the menu and had some good recommendations. We generally order a bunch of different items and share everything so we can try as many different things as possible. We opted for the octopus a la plancha salsa verde served with green beans and potatoes. It was cooked perfectly- not too chewy and the seasoning was on point! You can't go wrong with Blue Points so we also got half a dozen of those babies! The sardines were good, anything crunchy and salty can't be bad! I'm not sure I would get them again as they were a little dry, but it was also my first time eating them so I don't have a ton to compare to. We ordered the scallop ceviche which tasted great but was really lacking in the scallop department. I think we counted 4 small pieces. We brought this to the servers attention and her and the manager quickly took care of it and brought us out some more. I always feel weird bringing up issues with food but they were very receptive and we ended up with a great product! I'll definitely be back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for Saturday evening. There were 6 in our party- the table was ready, but we weren't happy with the seating arrangement. ( we would have been unable to talk to 1/2 of the group, because we were too spread out) Staff quickly made adjustments per our request, and it worked out perfectly. It was a wee bit tight when all the food was delivered; but the enjoyment of being able to converse and laugh with our friends was more important than the space.

Though open for only a few weeks, the restaurant was jam packed. Both the expansive patio and interior of the restaurant were really hopping.  I am so pleased when a business appears to be an instant success story.

Our entire table gave the restaurant high marks for the food. The servings were generous, presented adequately, BUT THE OVERALL SERVICE WAS LACKING.

My husband and I rarely visit a new restaurant. We like to wait until all the bugs and missteps are worked out.  So the failure of service on this night, was due to the newness of the restaurant and its staff.

May I make a few suggestions?  Please do away with the cloth napkins until you wash and rewash and please use a fabric softener. They were so hard, they wiped up nothing.
Use a good quality paper napkin until you get the texture of the new napkins where they can actually do the job.

I enjoyed the mussels- Large and delicious, but they were served with a hunk of day old bread or cut in advance and dried to a crisp. A small fish fork would have been a lovely touch to be served with the steamer of succulent mussels.

The prices seemed fair, and we intend to return again soon.

Not sure if you need to increase your staff for the weekend crowds or simply have a few more training sessions- and Management -keep your eye on the ball. You have a winner, if you work out the wrinkles.

Thank you for this new dining experience. We know how difficult it is to succeed in the restaurant business in the Valley. The competition is wild and the dining crowd is so fickle.

{"text":"Wow. I had high expectations - all totally blown away. Fantastic service. Fresh, bright, seaside decor. And the food was great. Feels like a high-end seafood spot in a far more relaxed setting. Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Cute new spot in the old Blue Burrito location, same out door seating but interior and bar are new and very inviting, I ordered the Ninja roll and it was okay, but my friend ordered the Poke bowl and that was delish!  I'll definitely go back to try some of their other items. Wait staff was friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"It's not my favorite sushi spot but it's very convenient down the street. I typically get a poke bowl. They are not like the ones I have got before but it fills me up for sure. Not a fan of the ceviche. Really big chunks of every ingredient and is only served with four tiny crostini's, which is clearly not enough. Very fresh tasting but not my cure for ceviche. Rolls are ok. Quantity of spicy salmon was great. Probably the best tasting thing I have had thus far. I have been here, 5 or 6 times. Hope better for next. I experiment each time."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for happy hour tonight 12/12/16. We ordered the spicy tuna, California roll, crab cakes and shrimp cocktail. We received our shrimp cocktail first. After taking one bite, we both started choking from the extreme amount of horseradish in the cocktail sauce. I'm mean to the point where we both had tears coming out of eyes and immediately spit out our bites! Sooooo spicy, like 10 x the normal amount in cocktail sauce.  We sent them back and explained.  The manager came out and said that is how they taste! Some people don't like spicy food, bullshit! There is no way that was accurate! We asked if he would try it and he did not! He brought us another order with a side of ketchup. He refused to admit that someone may have messed up on the recipe! They charged us for both orders and never offered an apology or to take them off the bill! The only reason we gave this places 2 stars was our server/ bartender was very sweet and apologetic. I hope that it was a mistake, or this place will be out of business  fast!"}
{"text":"OMG!  Finally a seafood restaurant in Scottsdale with reasonable prices and amazing service.
First week we found it - we went 3 times that week.  We keep trying the menu items.  The fish and chips and shrimp and chips are so lightly breaded and so good! My husband eats the oysters by the dozen.  QUALITY! AND TASTY!  
Iesha, the Bar manager, is so accommodating and friendly.  She can provide you with any drink you want and those you haven't even thought of.  
I hate writing this because I want them to do well but I still want to be able to get a reservation."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Pita Jungle, a Mediterranean-style restaurant with great hummus, salads and other delicious fare, so we had big expectations for their new spin-off, The Grand Blue. Perhaps it was the newness of the restaurant that was at fault, but the experience could have been much better. Here's a rundown of the place in outline form:

- Decor: It was bright and open, with a glass retractable wall that separates the interior from a pleasant terrace with awnings, pretty blue lights, colorful tables, and when the weather is hot, misters. Five stars for that.

- Service: I got the sense the waiting staff hadn't really done this before. Our server was very uninformed about the menu, had no recommendations on food or wine, and seemed to forget about us for long periods of time on several occasions. The result: The appetizers and main course came at the same time, the wine I ordered was forgotten until the very end of the meal (with no apology for forgetting it), and our water glasses, once emptied, were never refilled. Also, a busboy promised to bring another plate. That never happened. One-two stars.

- Menu: Be prepared to be confused. I guess some consider it to be a mark of restaurant excellence to have so many choices so as to be in utter confusion as to what to order (with no help from the serving staff - see above). Menu simplification would go a long way towards improving the experience. Two-three stars.

- Food: We ordered two sushi rolls from the Happy Hour menu. They were fine, but unimaginative and chilled (meaning that they had been prepared, not rolled to order). For main dishes, we ordered the shrimp on hummus (probably the best dish of the night), grilled wahoo (a very tiny piece of somewhat overcooked fish with absolutely no seasoning applied) that came with okay broccolini and nearly okay beans and asparagus (I was not a fan). 

The last dish we ordered was a poke bowl. You choose the protein, add-ins, and sauce. It was okay, but not particularly inspiring. The protein (yellowtail and octopus) seemed like it was pulled from a jar and that, along with the diced veggies and rice noodles, made for a very so-so meal. Three stars.

Will we be back? Maybe...in awhile...after they have had a chance to get their act together.

Final thoughts: We spend part of the year in a seaside town on the east coast. Generally speaking, the seafood there is great (one would expect nothing less), so I suppose we have high standards. Still, if you are going to open a restaurant in the very competitive Scottsdale market and go through the trouble of buying fresh fish for your establishment, as The Grand Blue clearly has, you should not waste the opportunity to wow the desert community by simply putting that seafood on a plate, sometimes overcooked and under seasoned and without any particular flair.

***UPDATE***: Thank you for your response Kevin. It is good to know that management is listening and I am hopeful for a better experience should I return at some point. I wanted to respond to a few of your comments for the sake of clarity:

- Service: I did see other servers who were much more engaged with their patrons, offering opinions, suggestions, and looking in frequently on their guests. I just happened upon one that was far less attentive. Consistency is key, though.

- Sushi roll: It is good to hear that rolls are made to order, but that leaves me a bit confused. I am a sushi fanatic, having been to sushi bars throughout this country and abroad, and usually when a roll is made, the chef will take rice from the cooker (not cold) and work with the fish and other elements of the roll. Because the rice is at least warm, the resulting roll will be slightly cool or room temperature. The rolls we had were as chilled as they would have been had they been left in refrigeration for at least 15 minutes. Thus, they did not seem made to order.

- Wahoo: I am also glad that the protein is weighed for a consistent serving. Perhaps because it was overcooked, the fish appeared smaller than its pre-cooked weight. As I am sure your chef is well aware, a white fish should be cooked just until opaque and when cut should glisten. That was not the case with my piece, which I shared with two other people for their concurrence (and they both agreed).

- Poke bowl: Perhaps I overstated my disappointment in the yellowtail and octopus by the jar reference, but I had thought the yellowtail would have been more tender (there was even a piece of bone or sinew in one small cube) and the octopus was sliced ribbon thin like one might have mixed in a salad. I had hoped to have more robust pieces of octopus to truly appreciate the rich flavor it has to offer.

I wish you the best as your restaurant settles in. I do not seek nor want any special treatment for my frank review, though. Should I return at some point and my experience then is better, my updated review will reflect it. Thanks again for your response."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious and well presented. The staff was friendly and the manager was helping everyone with a smile on his face when things got unexpectedly busy because of a nearby event. 
Prices are reasonable (although it looks like the have raised them slightly from some of the menu pictures on Yelp). Atmosphere is fun, modern, with a touch of beach theme on the patio. They were really busy, as I mentioned, but the layout was great and we could still have comfortable conversation. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Poke was AMAZING. It's a tad bit pricey, but for the quality and the amount of food you get it's so worth it. I really hope this place sticks around because a lot of places in that corner spot haven't, but this is the best restaurant to get in there by far!"}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour. Many experiences bode well. Cold crisp Pinot Grigio at only $5 for a generous glass, energetic server who mentioned a first-timer perk (delicious warm edamame in soy based sauce), delicious and crispy fried calamari appetizer (free with Yelp check-in) in lovely outdoor patio. Big plump Pacific oysters for $1 each--best sweet sour mignonette I've ever tasted--a tad sweet. 

Now the down side...all of which seem to reflect mostly inexperience and need for a bit more training and attention from the leadership. The server should be able to be clear and specific about the source of oysters. I usually give them the sniff test before I consume a raw oyster. There was a bit too much \"fishy smell\" -- not so much that I was worried they were not edible, but it overpowered the normally sweet smell and taste of the sea I like to have. Maybe ordering raw oysters on a Monday was a bad idea. I ordered clams in traditional broth but got mussels (which were tasty so I didn't send them back). The server, a wonderfully nice guy, had to be reminded to subtract the calamari and edamame charge, and pronounced the sauce marionette. :). Nothing heinous and all easily corrected with some better training and management engagement. 

Definitely worth a second visit!"}
{"text":"Nice, but not quite worth the price. 

The oysters were wonderful; I would go back for that part of the experience.   However, the rest of the meal was just okay at best.    

The fresh fish dishes are customizable with preparation, sauce, and side choices.   Both of our fish selections (Branzino and Grouper) improved when more sauce was provided.  The Branzino was served Plancha style; it was pretty but the sear made it tough and, yes, there are lots of little bones and not a lot of flesh.   Re sides: the broccolini with anchovy sauce was worth ordering again; the asparagus with white bean cassoulet was mostly just beans, although they tasted good; the chopped salad was just a basic cafeteria style, overdressed disappointment that we sent back.  

The outdoor atmosphere is very casual, although the prices are not.   With only 2 beers, a half dozen oysters, and 2 entrees we were almost $100.   Oh, and for that price, why no bread with the meal?

Not a terrible experience but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this restaurant won't make it. We stopped in Tuesday night and say at the bar for a cocktail and dinner. Place wasn't that busy..But we sat and sat after ten minutes (on our watch) we still was not greeted by the female bartender...No welcome. what would your care to drink? would you like to see a dinner menu? Nothing. She did not even look up to acknowledge us. So we walked out, went to another nearby restaurant. We won't be back here again. Sad."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the second day they were open. The original men behind pita jungle have done it again!   It was happy hour and we tried a bunch of different samplings. Got two bottles of wine +7 different samplings for $65. Great deal on happy hour menu.  The food was fresh and tasty.  Service was friendly and prompt.  One of the best meals we've had in a very long time in Phoenix.  Also can buy fresh fish to take home and cook yourself.  Can't wait to go back and try different things.  Great addition to the Arizona foodie scene."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come write this review (I haven't written one in over a year) because my experience last night was excellent! A friend and I stopped by to take advantage of the happy hour and it really exceeded our expectations, which were already high due to Pita Jungle's happy hour being the best value in town by far. I feel they have matched that value and then-some at The Grand Blue. 

We ordered all of the items on the Pintxo list. First was the smoked eggplant which came on sliced baguette. I didn't get much of a smoky flavor from it but it was so full of flavor I didn't mind. The white bean hummus with shrimp was also served on sliced baguette, with capers, and it was a tasty punch of flavor with a single perfect shrimp on each piece (2 per order). Next was the crab cake, also served on baguette (1/2 of a large crab cake on each piece). The bread seems unnecessary in this case but I'm not complaining since it was so delicious! The crab cake was hot throughout with lots of crab and a tangy remoulade on top. Lastly the mini shrimp roll was super flavorful. The shrimp were perfectly seasoned and served on a soft buttery roll. My friend ordered a second shrimp roll and I ordered a second crab cake. I would eat all of these items again!

We both ordered the blue crab California roll, and this was the only unremarkable item we tried. It was good, don't get me wrong, just nothing special. I'd probably try one of the spicier rolls next time. Each order was only 4 pieces. I feel they should clarify that on the happy hour menu, since I would assume for $5 I was getting a full size 8 piece roll like most sushi happy hours around town.

Service was excellent. Our waiter and two managers checked on us during the course of the meal. I love that they put a decanter of water on your table so you don't have to keep flagging down waitstaff for a refill.

I am very happy to have a new seafood restaurant to explore that is reasonably priced, with a bomb happy hour. I will definitely be back to try out the dinner offerings and the make your own poke bowl. Owners - if you are reading this, please consider a location in central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"A
MAZE
ING!!!!
Soooo good! We had sushi and Poke bowls! 
Food was amazing! 
Reasonably priced. 
Service was super nice - they are brand new open so still working out the quirks - give grace... it's so worth it! 
Thanks Derek!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with a friend for happy hour and this place was a MESS. The bartender with shoulder length, curly hair and tattoos was inexperienced and overwhelmed. She was constantly forgetting to put in our items, couldn't explain the wine and definitely didn't do a good job suggesting menu items- because she didn't know them. The boys that were serving on the floor were more helpful and attentive to us when we needed something...like plates. This place just isn't worth the money."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try The Grand Blue since it popped up on my radar a few weeks ago... So last night I decided it was the night! Best part was it was still HH when I arrived (until 6:30 nightly!)

So I plopped myself into a seat at the bar and perused the many menus (they were a little confusing and all over the place) but the friendly bartender Krystal walked me through them. I started off with a glass of the $5.00 HH Chardonnay and ordered 4 of their HH Blue Point Oysters for a $1.00 each. They were delicious, I just wish they served them with a mignonette. 
For my entrée I got the Poke bowl with Salmon, basmati rice, daikon radish, cucumber, micro greens, seaweed salad, sesame seed and avocado topped with the creamy poke sauce... It was really good, the salmon was super fresh and delicious my only complaint was the basmati rice, poke and basmati rice should never go together. I couldn't pick it up with my chop sticks. They should put the option for sushi rice on their menu and I totally recommend paying the extra $3.00 for more protein, the portion size of protein was really small, the fish to everything else ratio was not balanced at all! 

I love that they also sell their seafood fresh for you to cook at home! They had a pretty stellar collection.

All in all, my experience was super pleasant and I am really looking forward to going back and trying more of their delicious looking menu items (Mussels are a must next visit!). Things were so on point that it was hard to tell that they have only been open a few weeks! I think the owners of Pita Jungle/The Grand Blue should hold a \"How to open a new restaurant for dummies\" class!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! It occupies the old Squid Ink space.  Great food, decent service, and a cool atmosphere.

One of the best aspects is the fabulous assortment and super-sharp pricing on the happy hour menu, so you can try little bit of a bunch of different dishes if you are new to the place.  We were so impressed with HH that we stayed for dinner and continued the yummy fun!"}
{"text":"If you like your fish swimming in butter and oil then you'll love this place.  Sushi was good."}
{"text":"We decided to come in for just apps and stayed for dinner. Our server, Rubin was attentive, knowledgeable with the menu and respectful. Oysters, white bean hummus and the crab cakes (full of pure crab meat) were all outstanding. This is a little gem. We will be back."}
{"text":"LOVE... noticed this new restaurant and wanted to visit for happy hour. I'm very happy I did!
They have a extensive happy hour menu and their wine pours are not stingy ;) we had a dozen oysters which were so fresh and delicious, and some rolls with the crab cakes. I was so full but had to try their poke bowls which you customize to your liking. I must've done something right because my poke bowl was phenomenal! Wish I could remember what concoction I brewed up so I can order it again next time. 

The ambiance is nice. Quiet enough to have a lovely dinner conversation and enjoy the atmosphere. 

Service was friendly and prompt to boot!

Can't say enough good things about this dining experience. Check it out. I definitely will be!"}
{"text":"We are just finishing a lovely happy hour and early dinner on the patio here at The Grand Blue.  We enjoyed the shrimp, crab cakes, mussels and ceviche for a delicious casual meal.  The patio is comfortable for large groups as well as couples.  The happy hour wines offered are excellent.  Our evening was further enhanced by the charming and accommodating Spencer, our waiter.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I returned to The Grand Blue for a second time with a large party. I ordered sashimi and some oysters, and both were excellent!  
The bartenders did a great job providing drinks for this large group efficiently. 
Cannot really comment on other service, as our group did not use/have (?) wait staff, but rather ordered and picked up our own items at the bar. 
I will return and try other menu options."}
{"text":"I love fresh fish!! So happy it's now open. The casual, friendly and beautiful atmosphere makes me feel right at home.  Stylish menu with excellent variety of healthy fish and vegetable dishes with delicious mediterranean flavors.  My new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I had hoped that Grand Blue would address some of their \"rough edges\" but they haven't.  However, I would still have rated them 5* if there hadn't been such serious problems with the food this last trip.
1.  Barramundi a la plancha was undercooked.  About 1/3 of it was raw and inedible (this fish is very chewy when raw and cannot even be cut easily).
2.  The \"swiss chard and black-eyed peas\" dish was just swiss chard - no peas -- BUT they made up for it by adding another ingredient, namely small pieces of foreign matter which appeared to be parts of a broken dish or fixture.
3.  The flan dessert was frozen so solid that it could not even be cut.

These problems are so serious, in my mind, that a one-star review would be called for, but the servers continue to be exceptionally pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"This restaurant is incredible! From the barramundi to the fresh sushi, the incredible decor and the creative cocktails there is so much to love. The kids meal comes with a great portion and my 4 year old brother ate every piece of it because it was so yummy. The chowder was delicious to start with, followed by one of their \"custom blue zone\" items, which comes with protein, and two sides. I chose the scallops in lemon garlic sauce, garlic cilantro fries, and the asparagus casule everything was delicious. We also had the grilled shrimp, the planchared octopus and the fish Reuben. Everything was excellent. The two rolls we had were fresh and creative, they come displayed incredibly and taste incredible. Overall, my experience was nothing short of delectable and refreshing. Even some of my \"picky\" family members enjoyed everything they ordered as well."}
{"text":"The happy hour here has me saying \"wow\" everytime I visit! Oysters for $1, great deals on shrimp cocktail, ceviche, and mussels. If you order the mussels get a side of fries to dip in the broth, you can thank me later."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience! The custom poke bowls were out of this world! I would highly recommend this place to anyone and will be coming back for more! The staff was also great which made the experience even better!"}
{"text":"We tried the: 
Happy Hour Crab Cakes
Happy Hour Spicy Tuna Roll
Fish & Chips (Server said the fish today was Cod, not sure if it changes)
& The Build-your-own Poke Bowl

Crab cakes were good, nice large chunks of crab served on a little toasted round of bread, covered heavily with some kind of aioli and a few diced pieces of pepper.

Spicy tuna roll was mediocre at best, significantly more spicy than most sushi restaurants and a bit bland because of that, wouldn't order again. Served with pickled ginger and some fake wasabi paste.

Fish & Chips were very good, battered lightly and very crunchy. Fries were perfect, light and crunchy.

The Poke bowl was decent, they give you a huge list of ingredients and you choose two proteins, five veggies, one 'base', and one SAUCE***. Everything was fine other than the fact that the chefs apparently mixed up the 'house sauce' that I chose with the 'spicy house sauce' that is more or less just soy sauce and chili oil from what I can tell. It's EXTREMELY spicy, and I'm not particularly sensitive to heat. It tasted ok but overpowered everything and regardless of that, it's simply not what I ordered. The manager or owner came over and explained what had happened, and then kind of laughed it off after I said I didn't want a replacement.Did not feel well afterwords."}
{"text":"I have to start with the staff; they are exceptionally friendly and attentive. The setting is perfect for the product, which is good fish with modern twists. Clean and pleasant space. Now to the food. It's good and reasonably priced. At times the sides are an overreach but this is definitely a place to which I will return."}
{"text":"The food was very good. Staff needs training because the menu is quite convoluted. Very basic food presentation. A piece of fish slapped on a plate and side dishes served in bowls. Looks like prepared in home kitchen without any chef flare. With that said, prices are reasonable and food tastes good. I will definitely try again and would be more daring with my order. Get the Greek salad-delicious with anchovies!"}
{"text":"I give it a great try. Bartender fantastic and aware of customers. Mussels size great but minimal white wine broth for dipping and it was sour ?? First fish/sushi with Latin Music."}
{"text":"It was the second day this place has opened so we decided to check it out. We were a little turned off at first. The knowledge of the menu was not there and just felt unorganized. We told them I had to be gluten free, and they said that would be no problem. I got my first sushi roll and something tasted off, so I ordered another one \"salmon and avocado\" when it arrived, it was super spicy. They told me it was a spicy salmon roll which I know has gluten in it and I began to feel sick to my stomach. We brought it to the attention of a guy named Kenny \"the cool HR guy\" and he was totally understanding. He made sure he did everything he can to make sure I was okay and that we left at the end of the meal happy. We get it, it's only your second day open! And after the wonderful experience today, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there on Friday with some business partners and it was great.  Seafood is very fresh and well prepared (a very hard to find thing here in the desert).  My colleagues had sushi and I had the fish Rueben. Delish!  Waitstaff was awesome, friendly and knowledgeable.  They mentioned that the fish is a maximum of 36 hours from being caught to plate.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Clean and new. Went there on a Tuesday at 11am and had half sandwich with New England  clam chowder. Fish of the day was Ahi tuna and was used for sandwich. oh...tried to order otoro but they didn't have it.
Everything tasted good and was fresh. Service was good too.
Atmosphere was bright, open and clean. I enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere.
The Ahi Tuna sandwich had a fish scale in it that freaked me out at 1st because I didn't know what it was at first...not a huge deal to me. Soup good but was not hot...sat in bowl too long before serving??? Not sure."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I wasn't expecting such great food from a new resturant! I loved it!!  Fast great service."}
{"text":"My hubby and I enjoyed Happy Hour on the patio on a beautiful Saturday eve.  First of all, I love the space-especially the interior-great vibe!  Our server, Derek, was a complete delight and added to a wonderful evening.  We enjoyed cocktails and a great wine special.  We started off with the HH Sushi-all generously laden with fresh, succulent fish!  I was immediately sold on the Grand Blue.  My hubby loved the bowl of Seafood Chowder and Blue Point Oysters, while I dug in to my Poke Bowl-abundant with Ahi, Shrimp, Asparagus, Daikon Radish, Micro greens and Seaweed Salad paired with sushi rice.  Derek suggested the Creamy Poke sauce and it was heavenly-sweet, creamy and spicy!  Wowed my tastebuds!  I LOVE this place!  It is my new fave go to!"}
{"text":"Great new seafood spot in Scottsdale. Make sure u check out their killer Happy hour specials. I just hope the staff and management can get their act together. Maybe it was an off night for everyone, but had the slowest and most confused service all night."}
{"text":"Awesome Place! I've been here a couple times and the food is really delicious and fresh. Their crab cakes are really tasty - big chunks of crab and no filler. I've had their shrimp po'boy (it was a special - not on their menu) and it was absolutely amazing. Large 20 count shrimp lightly fried on a buttery split-top bun. Amazing! Their veg dishes were also spot on including their broccolini with anchovy sauce. Oh! And their fries are really good."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, custom poke bowls and a list of interesting apps & entrees highlight the offerings here. Huge outdoor patio for the when the weather is nice. Friendly service if not particularly knowledgeable service."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and are consistently impressed.  We like the variety and freshness of the food -all very well prepared.  Super friendly and accommodating staff.   The sushi is great and the place is very kid-friendly.   We're very happy to have high quality and reasonably priced seafood in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant due to high reviews on Yelp. But our high expectations were met with disappointment. The staff were friendly and attentive. Our waitress explained the menu to us and what popular items were, so we took her advice and ordered. 
My first disappointment was due to the temperature of the food. Most food were served lukewarm. I wish Cioppino especially was served hot; drinking Lukewarm soup in December is not very satisfying. The fish and chips probably would also have been 10x better if they were served hot. The calamari served with tentacles were delicious as well as the crab cakes. The sardines which were recommended came out soggy and very fishy. It took couple of hours to get that taste out of my mouth. We also ordered a poke bowl with sushi rice, but guess what? They were out of sushi rice, so replaced with basmati rice. However, if it were served with sushi rice, I could see the potential of this dish. 
Overall, left the restaurant disappointed and $120 less in the bank."}
{"text":"Nice new fish market style restaurant with an Eclectic feel and a daily happy hour from 3 to 6:30. Definitely needed up in this neighborhood. Friendly attentive staff that's here to help and explain things for your first time."}
{"text":"Long time residents. Decided to give The Grand Blue a try, very disappointed. Expensive. While the fish might have been \"fresh\" it was tasteless. No presentation, just slab of fish on a bare plate smothered in garlic. The side dishes unremarkable. Did I say expensive? I'm sorry this just isn't going to cut it. Maybe it's the location. Since the original Blue Burrito it has been one bust after another. We heard from a waiter at Pita Jungle that The Grand Blue was their restaurant. Maybe they should stick with what they know how to do or else visit a couple of really good seafood restaurants to learn how it's done."}
{"text":"It's the first excellent restaurant at the intersection of Scottsdale and Shea.  Unlike most of the new pokebowl chains popping up, they have a variety of innovative menu items for everyone.  And their tea made by some company called White Lion is out of this world!  Friendly staff and great atmosphere.  A winner all the way around."}
