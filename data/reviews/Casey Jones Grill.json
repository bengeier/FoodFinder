{"text":"Loved it.  We went on a Monday night to catch a football game.  The Hummus appetizer is an Arizonian take on hummus with chili powder instead of lemon and it was great.  We also ordered the pretzel with beer cheese dipping sauce which was delicious.  I ordered the buffalo chicken salad and my husband ordered the chicken Philly cheesesteak, Dad ordered the personal pizza that was made perfectly and Mom had a taco salad that was really good.  Service was friendly and helpful.  Will definitely return here next time we're visiting family in Phoenix.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The cheese curds are glorious!!! Reminds me of Midwest food and the service is good. Great place to watch football games and have a good time"}
{"text":"This place has been here for ever, and I like how it is not a big \"showey\" bar. It's a great neighborhood spot to go. Just had the buffalo chicken wrap with sweet fries like I always do and not once have I complained. Don't let the exterior let you fool you if you are a city folk."}
{"text":"Excellent food, burgers are quality fresh meat, soups are good. Phillis are huge and great drinks and beer selection."}
{"text":"The cook here certainly believes in baking stuff until it's truly good & dead, and the result was almost everything we ordered - pizza, wings, fries - was heated, heated and heated to the point of leathery tastelessness and indigestibility. The 'train-wreck' fries were overbaked to the point of requiring a bit of scraping to separate them from the plate; the wings were crispy but suffered from next-to-no saucing. At this moment, eleven hours later, I'm still in a state of digestive distress, sliding between crapulence and dyspepsia; it takes some real gut-bombing to produce THAT effect!  A great disappointment, given that I'd patronized this establishment before and found it's cuisine to be not stellar but acceptable.  A wall-mounted speaker right over our table blasted out hip-hop favorites, with the rawest of lyrics replete with 'n*gga' this and 'p*ssy' that and 'f*ck'' everything else, loud enough after ten pm  to make conversation at our table difficult. Y'know, musical tastes differ, but if you're taking Mom out, or have young kids in tow, you may want to find a place a bit more family-friendly. This ain't Peter Piper, for sure.   The server was on the ball, fast and attentive - about the only thing this place had going for it. Our pizza order was botched at the kitchen level; he did make best-effort to make it right, but by that time we were hungry enough to be willing to compromise our preferences in favor of just eating.   \"We draw a diverse crowd after 10PM\" was the server's excuse for the playlist (though I didn't take his point; the crowd seemed to be exclusively gen-Z and millennial-aged white working-class lads). It's now a bit less diverse, because this is one batch of over-50s who will be taking their custom elsewhere. Too bad, 'cause I've liked the place in the past; but this particular experience qualifies as a disaster."}
{"text":"Casey Jones is where I go to eat. Their sandwiches are great. Sean is the best. Marcie is a great waitress."}
{"text":"Went back for another try....... 20% off Cheesesteak Sandwiches on Thursdays.  I went with the regular one, onions and mushrooms. It was very good. Tender thin steak, great bread, just the right amount of cheese, onions, mushrooms.  The Fries, well, better than most places but probably could've used another 30sec in the fryer to be a bit crispier. I also tried the Fried Zucchini, it was good, but very basic.  Great local place with good company and cold beer! I will swing by once in awhile!  Always great service and friendly staff! I just wish they had my favorite video game Big Buck Hunter :-)"}
{"text":"Bad customer service, my bar tender is still washing dishes when my friends is ready to pay."}

{"text":"You can't getting a passing grade from me if the table you get seated at is dirty.  Dirty table -50.  Ordered a Queso appetizer - the chips were kind of stale. Ordered a french dip & got a philly instead.  One of the ladies at our table ordered a chicken salad with raspberry dressing.  The salad presentation was POOR.  The salad came on a plate? It was missing walnuts (which she later brought out).  The salad was DRENCHED  dressing.  The chicken in the salad was apparently good.  The two racks of ribs we ordered were good.  Don't get me wrong, I have been to this place before and the staff is friendly, their prices are good and the food quality is usually good. Plus  they have a really good happy hour. I made it a point with the FIVE other people I brought with me to go here because I really liked it in the past.  They had some gentleman playing guitar in the background, he was kind of difficult to listen to as well.  This visit was a disappointing miss for me, but I will give them another shot.  A generous two stars for this visit considering the filthy table."}

{"text":"CASEY JONES PUB AND GRILL-- WHERE THE BIG GIRLS-- ALL GET DOWN WITH THE JELLO! HELLO! What an influx of con queso that was! Recomends the three: Burger with Lentil, Pork Chop Egg Tofu, Seasoned Mahi. Definately An experience you could talk about your whole life so remember to visit."}
{"text":"I come weekly and am always served by Chris. I request to only sit with him when he is working and if he is not I ask if Billy is serving because he provides great service as well. Both of them always greet me with a smile and answer any questions I have regarding the menu and their suggestions are spot on as to what I am looking for to eat or drink that night. The food is always tasty while the mixed drinks are made just right. I always recommend Casey Jones to anyone I speak with about good places to have some food and drinks at while recommending them to sit with Chris."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere.. Try the philly cheese steak.. Yummy. Wait staff if very friendly and willing to fit your needs."}
{"text":"Quick story on how I ended here; I was talking with some co-workers about a burger called \"juicy Lucy\" from MN. I started looking around the area for a place that served this type of burger. I came across Casey Jones in yelp with a review stating about their juicy Lucy. So I called them up and they never carried the burger. The person on the call was so nice, she went and asked the cook if he could make it. And after a couple of minutes, I ended up at the restaurant. They went out of they way to make the burger for me. Not only was the juicy Lucy good, they even gave me extra melted cheese on the side! It was an excellent addition to the meal. It came with a choice of side. I had the mash potatoes and gravy.   The service was fast and the staff is friendly.   I'll be bringing more people her to try their juicy Lucy."}
{"text":"Came in today on a whim during my lunch break with a coworker. Place was your average bar an grill with basic food you would expect. They had pretty good lunch and drink specials. I ordered the green pork burrito from the lunch special menu and we got some wings since they were also on special. Wings were average and sauce was clearly store bought but they were juicy and cooked well. The burrito again was good but nothing special. What really held this place back was the service. Our waitress was stone faced and unfriendly. She overcharged us for the burrito and then acted like we were inconveniencing her and didnt even apologize. Im ok with mistakes as things happen but to act that way was ridiculous. I would probably not bother coming here again."}
{"text":"Good food. The onion strings are bomb. Service was great. Very friendly folks. Bartender was a nice guy."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the service was great. Drink prices were good. But for three people to go and spend $75 is not your $ that you give it.3 drinks for $10= good. The rest of my tab was for 36 wings, burger, rings and sweet potato fries. Now compared to other bars like Tailgaters the same order of food plus a bucket of beers and 4 Malibu n Cokes = $45 with food being just as good. So if you want bar food this is not the place to go. By the amount of empty seats the problem is your food pricing. Your a bar not a fine diner!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a local bar with good food, this is the place to go. Huge interior, friendly staff, and outstanding bar food as far as bar food goes. The cheesesteaks are the best I've had anywhere, and the burgers are close to as good. Huge menu and a decent tap list with good variety. Late hours are a big plus for after-event hangouts."}
{"text":"Great Cheese Curds but if they want to be a true Packer Bar they need to step up their Bloody Mary making skills. Ideas for a great bloody: Zing Zang or Major Peters mix, A1, Worcestershire, horseradish, lime, lemon, pepper, celery salt...... Garnish with pickle, mushroom, green bean,........ And a true Bloody comes with a beer chaser as well!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food good people always consistent great place to eat! Philly cheesesteak sandwiches, burgers, salads, Mexican food, full bar, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Casey Jones is a really good place to watch football if you're a big fan of the Green Bay Packers really hard to get a table at times but the service is really good really decent food at a good price they make homemade pizza really delicious and I love their chicken wings and their bloody marys are also really good I give it a thumbs up"}
{"text":"We had a great time. The food was great and the server was very nice. We have been going there for ovr 20 years and they are still on it. Customers matter. thank you"}
{"text":"Went in with boyfriend and 12 year old for dinner because it happened to be close. The waitress deigned to come by about 20 minutes later. Drinks came; my coffee had obviously been sitting on the burner since 6 am. Placed our (simple) orders. The place wasn't busy but after a half hour (soft drinks dry; no visit from the waitress) we asked where our food was. She said it would be right out. Ten minutes later we left. Told the lady at the door what happened and she shrugged. Couldn't have cared less."}
{"text":"Packers fan dream, service was good, had wings and chicken sandwich also good. Plenty of tv's."}
{"text":"My wife, son and I have been going to Casey Jones now for quite some time, however this most recent time we went the quality of everything kinda seemed to jump off a steep cliff.   We went in with some friends the other night and ordered some of their newest burger the \"Juicy Lucy\", after ordering them medium, we were rewarded with two burgers that not only seemed to be bleeding but the cheese the oozed out of them reminded me of a horror flick where the guy gets stabbed and his guts just pour out.   After taking the burgers back to the kitchen and being assured the would be taken care of, the burgers deffinately came back cooked... almost with a propane torch, talk about hockey pucks! and to top it off we didn't even get cheese in the new burgers making them not so.. Juicy ya know.   Where as before I would have preached this place to others, I can honestly say we won't be making a return trip until they get a better cook in the kitchen, didn't think it was possible to botch a burger, let alone four! this place has astounded me in the wrong direction =/"}
{"text":"You can't beat Casey's for pub food. Try the salmon dinner.....best in Phoenix. Great customer service and off track betting available. If they had the MLB package would be even better!"}
{"text":"I was there for a busy Monday night game and was extremely impressed with the service.  I give kudos to the owner who actually plans for big crowds.  The interior of this place is fun.  If you have kids they'll enjoy the model train that travels around the place.  (I secretly wished it would poor beer when it neared my table, but......).  If you're a Packer fan than go no further as this seems like it's Packer headquarters.  We had the wings and mushroom burger.  The food was good, but a little cold.    Overall though it was a fun night with good service!"}
{"text":"Fun bar went for karaoke toy train travels throughout bar great fish fry fun family place"}
{"text":"Got the casey's cheesesteak with added mushrooms, onions, and green peppers (for free). It was delicious. Also Comes with a side of your choice (their fries are pretty good). Also got the tasty pazookie for dessert and shared it with a friend (it's big enough for three people). Overall, great customer service and yummy, affordable food (13 bucks total). Will def come back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for amazing food and an awesome staff. Even the owners take time to say hi and check on their guests. I had the shrimp and grits and I will definitely order it again."}
{"text":"By far the best sports bar experience I've ever had! My boyfriend is a Packers fan and I am a Cowboys fan. This is not just a Packers bar, it's a Packers family. Even though I am not a fan, I had tons of fun here! Everyone was so nice to me, even though I was sporting my Cowboys gear. They sing songs and chants and even have a Packers train that runs on the celling. And a human train that marches around every time the Packers score. The food is super tasty and everything is reasonably priced. Moscow Mules for $5.50. Who could beat that?! The positive energy in this place during a Packers game is like nothing I've ever experienced before. I highly recommend stopping in for a game. Just get there early. It fills up!"}
{"text":"The food rocks, i got the spinach dip and cheese steak, highly recommend!!! The environment is awesome and I loved all the TV's to watch football, but our waiter Connor was super rude. He took forever to even greet us and get us our food, you could tell he didn't want to work. But I will be coming back regardless!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite dive bar back when I thought a dive bar had to be absolutely rank. I recently returned a few times after years of having been away and realized why i had stayed away so long.   The service varies depending who your server is. The beer is awful. Just a shitty selection. Really effing shitty. I seemed to remember their buffalo chicken strips being delicious but I must have been drunk out of my goddamned gourd. They were dry and had almost no sauce. Oh and don't listen to what anyone may tell you...LandShark is not tasty beer.  I also remembered why this is the only bar I have been kicked out of for getting into altercations. Almost all of the patrons were ass hats speaking total douchery and making me sick to my stomach as they used their smooth lines on the waitress such as \"Why don't you want to go home with my friend? He is hung like a horse. Har har har\"  Never have I been to a bar with so many children seated at the booths. \"You have a baby!...at a bar...\"  \"OK so why two stars Nathan?\" you may be asking yourself,  \"you seem to be really getting riled up about this place, why not give it one?\"  The jalepeno cheese steak sandwich is sooo effing good. Dirty real dive bar food...sooo good. Go during the day when no one is there and do not drink the Land Shark...it is not tasty beer."}
{"text":"My family's favorite place.  Great, not just good, food and a wide selection of beer.  The service is FANTASTIC and occasionally a local band shows up for entertainment.  We eat hear about 2 to 3 time a month and we will keep coming back.  Be sure to try the Pizza roll and their queso dip if you want more than excellent fried zuk for an appitizer"}
{"text":"If you want good service, don't go here on an \"event\" night. Completely packed and totally under-staffed. I wouldn't mind that, except the stress of that makes some of the waitresses bitchy.   My last experience involved a waitress visiting us 30 minutes after we put in our oder. She brought everything except for the sweet potato fries I ordered, so I reminded her about them. She came 15 minutes later with a $7 basket, of which I could see the oily bottom of. If I counted the fries, I would say there was no more than 20 pieces. Double-U-tee-eff. My over-confident friend stormed to the manager, shoved the basket in his face, and said \"Don't you think it's a little ridiculous to pay $7 for these fries when I can see the bottom of the basket?\" He agreed that it was ridiculous, and proceeded to over populate the basket with fries.   I've had good experiences here too, but just a warning that the service is not something you should have high hopes for. Also, the food. Generic bar food."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I say this because the management decided to make things better. What he forgot to do was fix the bathrooms. They're disgusting!   The wings, pizza, burgers and the beef nachos are great. I recommend that. They changed the menu, they should of kept it because it was affordable for families. Now somethings are priced way too much for the size and taste. The fish fry, its too watery. The tacos salad, the shell is stale and the lettuce seems old.   The wait staff used to be great, but I guess they wise up and left. Now they make you wait and sometimes the orders are not right and food is sometimes cold, but the people who do things right are the women that help clear the tables. THEY should be the servers! I bet they don't get tipped. But since my family are regulars we tip them. :)   This place is good for basketball and football. But you have to get here a half hour to an hour earlier to get your table or you'll be standing. Happy hour is great, but you should call to make sure when it is because it seems to change from time to time. The specials on the menu are great too. Saturday, if you're a fan of pizza and wings is great price!  I will be going back since the family loves the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great rotating beer selection. Great staff. Colorful characters nightly lol."}
{"text":"The grub is better than most other bar food I have encountered and Casey Jones is a regular place to visit for me.   The honey hot wings (order extra crispy) are OUTSTANDING! I will order them that way from now on. I mixed it up on a dozen. Half were honey hot, the other half medium. Honey Hot wins out. The burgers and salads are great (ranch dressing). Very expansive menu that offers a variety for the most discriminating pallet. (ha ha)  $2.25 bud light draft. $3.00 craft beers on Thursday I think. Anyway, it is a great place to chill and watch a football game, meet clients for lunch or just swing by for a beer and some wings."}
{"text":"True Packer Bar. THE place to be if you want to hang out with other cheeseheads. I got to the bar an hour early and the place was packed. There are lots of tv's. The bar also has off track betting so some tv's have the horses on. Our server was not friendly. I don't think she smiled once. She was also slow. I had to go to the bar for a beer later in the game. Our server was nowhere to be found. Other servers around us seemed to be nicer and quick with their orders. I had the grilled turkey sandwich and asked for rye, instead of the bread on the menu. Aweful!!!! First off, it was cold. I think they put the bread in a toaster, and then it sat for a while. The turkey was cold so I'm not sure what part of this sandwich was \"grilled\". The fries were good, thank goodness. I won't let the sandwich, or the server, keep me from returning. I like this bar. It's a great place to watch the Packers."}
{"text":"I took my son here for lunch (in order to avoid the sports fans and bar crowd) I was impressed with the variety on their menu and ordered a juicy big burger with a side of fries it was absolutely fantastic, my son had the chili cheese burger it looked mouthwatering and according to my son it was one of the best burgers he's had since we have been in Phoenix.  Service was very friendly and it was a very kick back relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"We just discovered Casey Jones Grill had a couple of lunches couple of gatherings and am very happy. It's become our neighborhood place to go."}
{"text":"Casey Jones is an Amazing Local Bar. I absolutely love the community presented and apparent here. The owners, servers, and especially the skilled chefs, draw me and my best friends here. Mike the bar tender and Armando the skilled culinary adventurer top this place off with a cherry on the Sundae...Chris the bar tender always offers a beautiful smile and friendly welcome. I enjoy the music freedom of selection. If you're here too late and don't agree with the patrons choice of music, I suggest you come back during lunch. Caseys's seems to promote the patrons experience and accommodate each genre. Including many fun options throughout the week to include each patrons interest. This place is FAMILY."}
{"text":"This has got to be the WORST customer service experience I've had eating a full dinner with a friend at the bar at Casey Jones AND I still tipped  even with a bad attitude and inattentive service AT BEST from the bartender M.  To begin with, he never acknowledges your presence the minute you sit down although he knows you are there.  No smile, no greeting.  You had to literally beg him to not only take our dinner order but the worst was to continually flag him down to get our bill so we could leave!!  I gave him my cc upon arrival and had to get his attention AGAIN to let him know he already had my card in which he argued with me that he did not. He then realized he did have it after all.  The tipping point came when he ROLLED HIS EYES at us as if we were putting him out to pay our bill because it was a work day and we needed to go home.  WOW !!  Never  had to beg to pay an 80.00 dinner tab before or just get his attention period.  Perhaps M needs to learn how important customer service is if they want patrons back.  There are other Packers bars around and our family and friends won't be back. Again the WORST attitude and customer service experience from a bartender ever.  One bad apple..."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars if they had sports audio instead of the earl 90s pop music. Sheryl Crow does not belong playing in a sports bar.  Food is excellent; service at the bar is awesome. I've never sat at a table, so no clue on general seating service. It does tend to collect a rough crowd, but generally well behaved and friendly. OTB can be fun way to lose $40"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i have been going here for years and although the food is still good the service from some bartenders and the rowdy customers who come in for off track betting are quickly making this place a less desireable destination. We enjoy coming here since we both are huge packers but lately its just been not fun to go."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars, I would.  This was the worst experience I have ever had from a server.  To begin with, the busboy brought our silverware and menus out right away (A+).  Then it went downhill from here...When our server, Aubrey, finally did show up, she asked us for our drink order and we told her were actually ready to order.  This did not matter to Aubrey...she took our drink order and said she'd be back for our food order when she could write it down.  Okay....she brought back our sodas and we order our burgers.  Mine was ordered medium and my wife ordered hers well done.  Some time later when the food arrived, we asked for some sliced pickles....they never showed up until we asked the busboy to bring them to us. I guess Aubrey was too busy helping everyone else to get our measly pickles.  Now, I think well done has a universal meaning of cooked all the way through.  Aubrey may have had the chance to fix this if she ever stopped back by to check on us, but she did not.    During this time, we observed Aubrey checking on other patrons but we somehow escaped her attention.  I was tempted to ask her what we did to upset her but she never came back to our table.  We finally flagged her down to get our check, it took way too long to prepare.  To give you an idea of how bad the service was, the bill was $24.82, I left $25.  I asked to speak to the manager and David came out and introduced himself as the owner and I explained to him what had happened.  He introduced his wife to me and asked her to get me a gift card for the amount of my check.  He was extremely apologetic about the service we received.  A few minutes later I was out the door with my gift card (which I did not want in the first place).  My wife was waiting outside (that's how upset she was) and when I told her what had happened, she took the gift card and was going to return it to him and let him know that's not what we wanted.  As we were walking back in, we spotted a homeless gentleman and offered the gift card to him as we had no intention of EVER returning.  My wife went in to explain to the owners what she had done with the gift card and the homeless gentleman followed us in and was going to order some food.  We left and as we were pulling out the parking lot, the homeless man informed us that David had taken the gift card away from him and told him it was not valid and that if he didn't leave he was going to call the police.  Wow....really?  Unbelievable...we will never return and I sincerely hope anyone reading this will think twice before patronizing an establishment that treats people this way."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good neighborhood bar. It's not fancy and the food is typical bar food , but decent. Kids are welcome as long as the kitchen is open.   Two notable things about Casey Jones. One is it's a Green Bay Packers bar. The other is that half the bar has OTB capab"}
{"text":"Best sports bar and grill in Phoenix, especially if you're a Packers fan. I counted around 40 TV screens all showing sports from ice hockey, basketball, soccer and various talk shows about sports. Background music is lively and upbeat with selections from the '70s to today's hits. We eat at Casey's on Friday nights because they have the best fish and chips west of London and east of Australia! Everything is served in a basket and it's always fresh and hot. The chips (French fries) are crispy and so is the batter-dipped cod. They offer a 3-piece or 5-piece meal served with a side of home-made cold slaw and tartar sauce. Both are equally delicious as the fish and fries. I've also had a burger at Casey's - they're big, juicy and tasty. They also have a very good selection of draft beer and a comfortable bar if you prefer to enjoy your meal there instead of in one of the many comfy booths or tables. The wait staff is young, energetic and very friendly.  Be sure to look up. Miniature train tracks hang from the ceiling and a train and a trolly car travel above your head. Every now and then the sound system is taken over by a train horn.  If you're into the ponies, off track betting is available in a side room with several billiards tables. And more TVs!"}
{"text":"I used to like coming here for UFC...  The service has always been a bit questionable, but the food was decent enough to make up for it and best of all, no cover charge.   I came for lunch a month or so ago with coworkers and discovered the new menu. No more sweet potato fries, no more jalapeno bottle caps, no more cheese curds? Say it ain't so! Also, all new servers, and the bathrooms somehow have gotten even more disgusting. Functioning locks on the doors would be nice.  Tonight was the last straw. A waitress or manager, and then a child (yes, really) kept coming on over the speaker to announce the drink special. We'd been there since 5pm, and so had just about everyone else. The final time was DURING the lightweight title fight, mid-round.   I don't care if I have to pay a cover to go somewhere else. I'd like a wait staff that will notice garbage on the table from the previous customers and CLEAN IT OFF WITHOUT ME ASKING! C'mon! I'm not sure if most of the changes are due to a new owner or manager, but the servers need to be trained, and the overhead pages to announce drink specials need to stop. It's loud and annoying. Also, screwdrivers as a special on Saturdays is maybe appropriate in the morning, but how about long islands or rum and coke later on? I'm not going to drink a screwdriver with hot wings and pizza on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and never had a bad, nor spectacular experience. I sure do enjoy the old school track train ricketing around the ceiling. Beyond that it's pretty nondescript. TVs (new, flat), diverse crowd, some bar games...  We have posted up at the bar each time. Friendly service. The menu is pretty big and diverse. The food is good enough to fill you up and prepared well. Wine was cold in a smaller glass than I prefer. Beer was cold and specials were going for happy hour, though seemed on par with general drink prices for HH in the area. Our tabs have all seemed in the 40 dollar range for a 3 hour stay or so.  The problem is, when I look back I really just can't think of any experience or situation that stands out. I looked at my check-in here and it honestly took me a few minutes to remember what this place even was. :/.  If you are looking for a neighborhood strip bar of good size and varied menu and drinks this is a fine place to go. It just really didn't have any real effect on me.  This boring/neutral review pretty much sums it up. Um...Cheers?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this bar is right by my house so I was hoping that this would be a good one. The first time I went there it was a decent experience, but it seems that things are going down hill. There have been several times when we ordered premium drinks (Jack or Captain) and it seems that they are serving us well drinks but still charged us the premium price! Trust me, I'm a very experienced drinker and know the difference from well whiskey and Jack. The last time my friend and I went there we went in and sat at a table and never got acknowledged. We were there for over 15 minutes and not one waiter or waitress stopped by and they weren't even busy! We finally ended up leaving went to another bar. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Dive bar and no other way around it.  Cheap beer, cheap wings...leave full and a bit of grimy dirt on you that you must wash off before you go to bed. The neighborhood makes sense how this places stays in business, it fits the niche of a hangout for \"salt of the earth\" persons.   Not my element but well worth trying ones vestige of 'hey I just want a drink and not pay 5 dollars for it.\"   How I came across this pub was not a mistake, but more a deliberate attempt to produce a dilettante achievement to find some local bars in the north valley. We achieved and now have found possible watering holes which will come in handy if I ever make my way to Desert ridge.  R\_  NOte: You ears will melt crack and die when you hear the karaoke.

{"text":"Best chicken tenders in my neighborhood! Can't wait to go back and try more food!! Seriously a diamond in the rough & you CANNOT get near this place when the packers play!! Line out the door on game day!! There's a reason !"}
{"text":"Pretty much the perfect Sunday football experience. If your a Packers fan, this is the place to be, but if a fan of any other team, you might want to stay away because your game may not be on and if it is, it will be on a very small and older TV. I went with a Packers fan and luckily I could see my Giants getting mauled on another TV. The bloody Mary's were excellent at $3.50 a pop (ask for a pickle), but no other drink specials. The philly cheese steak was the best I had in ages and is in my Top 5 list. White American, ribeye, onions, sweet and bell peppers and the cheese curds were authentic as possible. Friend from Wisconsin said the curds were the best she has had since home. Marcie was a great waitress, just too bad the packed bar had to leave sad after a wild loss."}

Their cheese steaks are awesome, cheese curds amazing, chimichangas are out of this world!!!!! Staff is always nice and attentive. Hint: try their soups. Really! They are made from scratch and just fantastic! My favs are the clam chowder and the cream of mushroom!!!!!"}

Seemed like she was taking care of her regulars just fine but was avoiding our table. Her loss since I'm a server and would have taken care of her.   Food was average for a sports bar. A little on the expensive side but alright portions.   Probably won't be going back."}

I should have turned around as soon as I started to drive into the area. This part of Phoenix is really bad. The police were everywhere rolling up and down Bell Rd. and I passed but the gang unit just across the street from Casey Jones. The parking lot was filled with a bunch of vehicles that had seen better days.   As I made my way to the door I passed a group of guys thought were smoking cigarettes but I was wrong. It was pot. I'm thinking leave now, but I'm starving so I pressed on.  Inside was horrible. Loud blasting TVs and even louder blasting heavy metal music. I found a seat at the bar and waited. And waited. And waited. 15 minutes to be exact. Meanwhile the bartender is yakking it up with the locals talking they were talking about Obama dropping F bombs and N bombs left and right. I'd had enough. Bye!  Can't tell you about the food; I didn't get none.  Can't tell you about the beer; I didn't get none.   The guys out front did ask if I wanted to buy some pot. That was the only customer service I got."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend for a burger and drink and was not disappointed.  I have driven by for years, their parking lot was always full, but never stopped.  Today  we stopped, warmly greeted and asked what type of seating we prefer, booth, high top other standard table.   The place is very large and has at least 50 TVS.  Cute trains above gliding by, not distracting but cute.  All ages of diners from 2 years to 80.  They have a nice bar.   Lots of different beers, I prefer spirits and they had them all.  Service was friendly, he checked in on us several times, but not bothersome.   They have quite a variety of apps including cheese curds.  We got Angus burgers cooked to,perfection.  I will be stopping in again.   If you are a Packers fan this is your place, but everyone is welcome."}
{"text":"Good mix of different meals to choose from. Pizza is the best in this neck of the woods. Wings are genuinely good. We bring out of town guests here all the time because of the selections."}
{"text":"While having dinner we witnessed our table next to us... Trailer trash customers eating what they brought in from elsewhere from another burger place with fries. What does that say? What does that convey to us and other patrons? We ordered beers and food, and the food was just mediocre, average would be the overstatement. They are sooo close to our home, but we will now have to drive farther for a meal."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place. My family and I went in on a Friday night, the place was not full and they were not that busy. We had a party of 5 and sat in a corner booth. We sat for roughly 20 minutes and was not acknowledged by any staff. One of the waitresses was pregnant and was waiting on a table right in front of us. She ignored our party several times and didn't say hello, I'll be right with you NOTHING!! I never had this bad of service here. This was a surprise to me. We ended up walking out, we didn't even get to order drinks, sad part is no one noticed us leaving. I'm so disappointed in this establishment."}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar. Me and my wife have started coming to this place all the time with some friend and let me tell you why.   1. Good beer selection. You wouldn't expect a cheese head bar (Green Bay Packers) to have as many craft beers on tap. No offense to the North Midwest, or whatever it's called, but those guys are known for producing cheap American pilsners.  2. Good bar food. I would stay away from Mexican food here, but things like cheese steak, fried cheese curds, wings, and burgers are delicious.  3. Good prices. The foods and beers prices are very reasonable.  4. Lots of TVs."}
{"text":"Fantastic bar! My gf and I chose this bar because it was the only place nearby that served pretzels and beer cheese that wasn't a brewery.  Walked in the door and almost immediately come face to face with a 6' tall statue with a packers bar with a packers jersey on and you immediately know you're in packers territory.  Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of football (a total plus in my eyes).  The food was fantastic for the price.  The topping on the cake was excellent music selection.  A whole lot of early 2000s rock (Korn, Rob Zombie, Prodigy, etc).  It's something different and a very nice change of pace.  I definitely will be frequenting this establishment, especially during football season."}
{"text":"My whole family has been going here for a few years now and the food is always good. My mom and my wife always enjoy the special of the day pasta. The servers always seem to be pretty nice and will let you know what they think about the foods on the menu if you can't decide because everything sounds good!"}
{"text":"Consistently over the years PERFECT ! Great friendly service and the food ALL OF THE MENU... never disappoints! Occasionally when I want a perfect burger or some sick friend is craving one I call here. The staff is always happy even to hand over a take out meal. Please don't ever change! Oh yeah friendly bar and sports tv."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Casey Jones Grill for years and years. I can't believe I've never reviewed this place! I love the service. The food is far from top notch but really...one comes here to chill with the guys and/or enjoy time with friends over sports, music and good food. I love the Happy Hour Menu. Well...I don't love it quite as much as I used to since I've lost 27 pounds but every now and then I do enjoy The Chicken Strips & Fries or Mini Con Queso. Yum Yummmm. Aside from the Green Bay Packer memorabilia, it's a cozy little joint and dive bar. Check it out. Cheers****"}
{"text":"Disappoint....they took our favourite item off the menu ....Mexican pizza. Bring it back please."}
{"text":"My creepy best friend is a huuuuuuuuuuge Green Bay Packers fan. He's a Mexican that grew up in LA. Go figure.   My birthday just passed and we decided to gather a bunch of people and party like it was 1999. We took a few tables, I drank like a sailor, and had their mouth watering wings. The burger I had here was very very...tasty. Yes, yes...tasty.   The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was a lady singing who should not quit her day job. Bless her soul, she had the heart of a champion, but a bar like this is probably not the best place to be discovered. Other than that, this place is pretty mighty morphin power awesome.   I still think Green Bay isn't that great, but that is coming from a Raiders fan. :("}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cheap drink, this is it. Casey Jones tries to pass off as the bourgeois of bars, but really Casey Jones a kitschy place for the younger crowd as \"the place to be\" on a Saturday night. Typically they have a  band in the corner of the pool room that's plastered and singing cover songs off-key; and by the time I'm leaving five people will have been kicked out for disorderly misconduct.   Then there is always the drunken bitch at the bar who declares it's time to make a scene because the bartender was doing her job and cut off  the \"Drunk Bitch.\"   It's a fun place to go when you want to people watch (obviously for the reasons mentioned above) or laugh with friends over the crazy Japanese TV shows broadcast by G4 on the bar TV's.  On weeknights the domestic longneck beers are 95 cents and they have 2.50 you-call-it's.  The food is sooo good (but bad for you like any other bar food) and they have half-price reverse happy hour special. It's slow during the week; it takes forever for the food to come out. The kitchen closes at midnight so order first thing when you get there."}
{"text":"As a Packer fan myself from Racine, WI, this is one of my favorite neighborhood establishments.  A wonderful menu of delicious entrees, karaoke, pool tables and of course the seasonal games.  This place can get unbelievably packed during the games so make sure you arrive early to get yourself a seat.  Go Packers!"}
{"text":"Good Food Good Service, too bad its a Packers bar! LOL"}
{"text":"Nothing to see here really.  Not much on tap beyond the white trash specialties.  The menu is huge, so much so that it's convoluted.  They're just trying to do too much.  The service usually blows, cause it's staffed by burned out looking skanks, and I'm being nice here.  On the weekend it packs full of douchebags who are engaged in mortal douchebaggery.  it's the kind of place you could get into a fight in when you're not looking for trouble.  Everyone seems to be posturing around here.  I remember when this place first opened up before it expanded 3 times.  It started as an old dudes sports joint now it's a drink special douche attractant.    I wouldn't go here unless forced to.  Ohe yeah the drinks aren't cheap here either, unless there's a special."}
{"text":"I've been in he north valley for about 2 months now. I've been an east valley resident for over 20 years. I met my buddy here for a few drinks today, he told me he use to love this place but stop coming due to his favorite bartender not working there anymore. Shawn was awesome and made my visit amazing. This guy knows what he is doing. This just became my favorite bar! Keep into Casey Jones you she something great here...."}
{"text":"food was just ok! Our server wasn't to attentive and we felt like we were getting kicked out he gave us our check before we could order another drink"}
{"text":"This place is as horrible as Green Bay's chance at another super bowl win. If you like overcooked crap and ridiculously bad bartenders this is your place. Must be a Midwest thing, because in the real world we don't tolerate that."}
{"text":"Favorite local dive bar in N. Phoenix. Food is amazing and good service. I recommend Casey's to everyone I know. This is my favorite place to catch a game and spend time with friends."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar and grill, televisions everywhere. Stopped in yesterday for a late lunch. The special of the day sign glared in my face as I walked through the door. Wisconsin fried fish sounded good. Sat down, very personable server arrived immediately, ordered, timely food arrival, fish was very bland and thickly battered. No seasoning what so ever! Yuk!! Fries, well nothing to write home about. The typical frozen fries. Cole slaw tasted good, however, you get a condiment dish size serving. Zucchini appetizer has an overpowering seasoning and very heavily battered. I ordered water to drink with either a lemon or lime wedge. I got both, :)). Thanks!!   I've eaten here several times. I recommend the excellent burgers or the fabulous prime rib.   Until next time..."}
{"text":"Went in today to have some dinner with my girlfriend as we had a coupon (never been here before). The waitstaff was very friendly, the food was decent and the atmosphere was pleasant!   The songo (bingo with songs played) was pretty cool, too. I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Ok ok so this place looks like a dump, yes. HOWEVER I have been here a few times for the burgers and wings and they are delish! Burgers are made to order, exactly how you ask for them. Normally I order a burger medium and it comes well well well done. Here you order it medium, there it is nicely light pink and juicy. And the wings....ah the wings. If you are a hot wing fan like I am, you will appreciate them. They are big, juicy, and crispy. I like them medium flavor and they are just spicy enough. Service is decent, decor is dated, but the food is worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is old from 2015, not sure if it qualifies but if not feel free to delete it : )  Boohoo... not very green and not very convenient. : ( I signed up for their e-club  \"Must Print Coupon and Present Coupon when ordering\"  Food and service are good."}
{"text":"Im not sure who this Mike person is. Owner, manager, bartender.  He is the most unprofessional person i have ever come in contact with. I certainly hope he isnt a mainstay at your establishment.  He certainly isnt good for business."}
{"text":"Disgustingly filthy. Breeding ground for food poisoning, drink poisoning, filthy ice in drinks. Avoid this place at all costs. Rudeness runs rampant in this safari park."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place being a Packers bar and me being a huge Packers fan since the age of 6. After waiting so long to eat we really were down to try anything. I ordered the food over the phone for pickup. I ordered the fried zucchini, the Fireman burger and fries. The guy told me over the phone that the food would be ready in 20 min. I arrived at the bar to pickup my food 15 min later and the food was already sitting there. It must have been waiting for a few minutes seeing I live two minutes away and it already began to drastically cool down. The burger was barely done. I like some pink in my burger but this was way too much. The fries were soggy and the zucchini was weird, mushy, and felt like it was frozen and then fried at too high of a temperature too quickly. Bad experience. Won't be back"}
{"text":"I've had several different dishes here including the cheesesteak, butter burger, ribs, wings, pizza, steak and the chicken burger. The food has always been well above average to great and the service friendly and prompt. I have taken friends there and it has become our go to local place. So even if you're not a Packers fan, do your tastebuds a favor go there. Go there NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Do NOT confuse this with the CJ on Thunderbird. Same name different owners.   I went here on a suggestion from the guys at Batteries Plus on Cave Creek and Bell Rd. He said they have a great burger/frys/drink combo.   Shoo Nuff! The darn parking lot lingered of fresh hickory smoke and I knew it wasn't from the mexican food place. Good Start.  I walked in and headed right for the bar. I judge a food establishment by the bar.... just kidding.   The bar was large, clean and in front of several tv's. I waited for about 2-3 min for the bartender to see me because she was talking to patrons. (this does not bother me, instead makes me enjoy the place more.)  I asked about the grub/brew special and she said. \" it is either a burger, frys and drink (draft or pop) OR ~~WTF there is an or??~~ a pulled pork with frys and a drink (draft or pop)   Well after smelling the smoke from the car I knew I had to get the pork. Plus I had a fresh from the dry cleaners WHITE shirt on.   I get my Mt Dew... yeah! and two seconds later a nice large size pulled pork on sesame seed bun, with a ton for frys and a pickle spear.   The pork was PERFECT. Great flavor, cooked slow, nice meat with no fat. The sauce was better then average but lacked a little. Maybe a spicey bbq was what I needed. The frys were bar frys, cooked perfectly and plenty to eat. The pickle was well a pickle.   The Mt Dew rocked!  The bill came to under $6 and I was happy. I didn't even spill on the shirt. (I do smell like a camp fire but I like that)  The place is large but with a small feel. The servers are attentive but not intrusive, the food is great from the one sandwhich I ate. I did signup for a \"discount card\" they offer. It is a point system and you get discounts off of the food and a special something on birthdays."}
{"text":"The service left something to be desired, but the drinks are cheap and the entertainment is typical bar."}
{"text":"Shocked at how good the hot wings are at this place.  Decent beer selection including micros and macros.  A great place to watch football this fall and winter.  Terrific service in a very comfortable setting."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit. It has a reverse happy hour--ON WEEKENDS, which is pretty nice. $1.50 small pitchers of Coors Light and 2.50 u-call-its can't be beat. Also, they keep the kitchen open pretty late, so you can indulge yourself with a cheap, greasy pizza before you head home.  To be fair, you do get what you pay for. My white russian, vodka cranberry, and gin and tonic were all poorly mixed and packing way too much liquor. That sucks in a good way, but I kinda wish they had more bartenders. They were always in a rush and seemed pretty pissed off, but I can't blame them entirely with that sort of workload.  Also, beware of security. They aren't jerks, but they have zero tolerance. I saw some douchebag kid with his Hollister collar popped defiantly throw a napkin on the floor like he was a rebel without a cause. The bouncer kindly grabbed said popped collar, commanded said douche to pick it up, and kindly set him back in his seat. Owned.  Beware, older Yelpers. This place is a stone's throw from ASU West, so if you have a bias against college kids stay away. I like the crowd, it was large, and by no means a sausage fest.   Between all the people, the cheap booze, the food, and the DJ, this place is pretty damned solid 3.5 stars rounded down to 3. Even though they do a lot of things right, I won't become a fan of any establishment that can't make a drink to my liking! I'll still come back for more if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great place for food! I really like their Philly cheesesteaks & honey hot wings."}
{"text":"Been coming here for casual drinking for years now. Went here on a un-eventful Saturday night. There was good amount of people here and I can imagine that on busy nights like when a game is on or something that it would be impossible to find a table for a few people let alone some bar stools. We sat at bar since it's easier to flag down a bartender for some booze than waiting on the waitresses.   There are pool tables.  There are dart boards. (might not be there anymore)  There is a train driving around.  There are two patios.  The good:  If you're an alcoholic like me, then you will like it here. They stack their mixers decently unlike mill where they don't put enough liquor. If you like your mixers with a lighter taste...be sure to state that.  The parking is easy and spacious in the plaza parking lot and the place is easy to find.   Saturday night special are $5 large pizza until midnight when the kitchen closes and $2.50 drink special of large pint domestic. Appetizers are half on during their happy hour I think. I would recommend going during happy hour if you're looking to save.  The bad:   Table service. When it's busy, it's hella busy. You literally have to do smoke signals to flag down your waitress. Typical wait is anywhere from 5-20 minutes depending on where you sit and how busy they are."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood bar/grill.  Great food, good beer selection, lots of tvs and fun service.  Fabulous for sports watching."}
{"text":"I miss being in Wisconsin for the games and Casey Jones makes me feel back at home! The atmosphere is so dynamic on game day, nothing better than being surrounded by a bunch of packers! Not only do I enjoy the environment, but their food is fantastic. The cheese curds, pizza, and honey golden wings are my idea of bar/gameday food. So happy this gem is in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place looks like a total dive from the outside and is in a difficult to access parking lot. However, the food was so good! I had the Carolina Gold pulled pork sandwich. My dad had the Chicago Dog. We are thinking about going back again the very next day! I didn't notice at first but there are model train tracks running all along the ceiling. How neat to watch the trains go around."}
{"text":"Love going to this bar, especially when a packer game is on. Expect it to be busy during football games but they have a ton of seating. Great bar food and beer specials."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting from Oshkosh, WI (planning our move to the Phoenix area).  We wanted to watch the Packer game with some fellow cheese heads and this place came up with a simple google search.  It was awesome - flat screens all over, a decent menu, and excellent service- Also, the GO PACK GO chants made us feel right at home.  We will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"This is a solid sports bar. Very local and charming. They have a model train that circulates just below the ceiling on a suspended track. They are known for the Philly cheesesteak and it didn't disappoint. It is thin sliced prime rib with onions, mushrooms, jardinara peppers,  (jalapeños are optional)and all a hot a gooey delicious mess. The bread is fantastic on this sandwich. They have a great. Homemade spicy mustard wings sauce. They have a nice assortment of beers on tap. They have very good service and personable waitresses. Lots of TVs to catch all the games."}
{"text":"OMG, awesome wings! Casey Jones on Bell is always a great place to meet a bunch of friends. Service is always on point and the staff is super friendly. The food is never disappointing and always hot and fresh. It was disappointing to see the one on 43rd Avenue and Thunderbird close but I know that was a different owner."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood spot.  I used to think it was just a sports bar and couldn't possibly be a good place to eat...but about 9 months ago I moved into a house right behind it so I checked it out.  I totally misjudged this place.  It is a sports bar... but it's also a family friendly restaurant with really good food!  The burgers are amazing as are all the appetizers I've tried.  Good wings and pizza, good ranch dressing.  I wish it had a few more low cal options but it's a damn good place to have some amazing, classic American comfort food.  Also, they always get the to-go orders right and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"So I recently moved to Arizona from Los Angeles, and this place is close to my home, and had some great specials during the Lakers vs Suns games. The only reason this place got 2 stars instead of 1 is because they had $5 large pizzas and $2.50 you call its (except for top shelf). The crowd this place attracts is sooo ghetto and beligerent. They were giving away shirts that said \"F*#K The Lakers\" on it. My boyfriend, 1 other table, and I were the only Lakers fans...which we expected. Everyone is wearing their stupid shirts thinking the Suns actually had a chance. It is here I realized how lame and dumb people can be. They were walking aorund making LA signs with their fingers saying \"Leave Arizona\" people were trying to start fights with the Lakers fans because they said  \"LA sucks\" then I asked why and they said \"well, I've never been there, but it just is lame\". So I deal with these rude obnoxious people til the end of the series, which of course the Lakers win! I just laughed at the Suns fans who bandwagoned onto Celtics fans because they were so butt-hurt about Phoenix losing. Cry me a freakin river! So there's stike 1.  Strike 2 is that it literally takes FOREVER to get a drink in this place! We even timed it and it took 10 minutes to get drinks when the place was not even half full! We figured you should order your next drink when you get your first so by the time you are done, you're second drink MIGHT be brought to you soon. The food is okay, nothing special at all, but not disgusting. There are also many children in here playing pool, air hockey, and the basketball game while people are getting wasted & partying. It's just weird. They also took part in cussing people out when their parents were getting into it with other people. Wow just wow.  Strike 3 came the other night when we showed up to eat because we had a coupon & ended up playing trivia. The trivia was fun, until the table behind us (full of people 45 years and older) were cussing, yelling, and harassing the girl who was hosting the trivia. She was getting pissed, and so were we. We lost 1 question because they kept bothing all of us. Casey Jones is a place you can go to and play trivia at 7pm and be harassed by geezers who get too drunk & act 21. I have also heard stories about my friends who have gone & people started fights with them for no reason. The people were friends with the owner or bartender, so my friends got kicked out & not the people who started the fight! I would not recommend this place at all. Go to Padre Murphy's down the street or somewhere else. Anywhere else."}
{"text":"GO PACK GO!!!!! I can't believe we have a Packers bar in Phoenix Arizona!!! We love it!!!!! Food is a wide mix of variety...from Hot Wings to Greek Gyros...its got it all! Love the memorabilia here!! Great food, fun times and it's actually quite large with 3 different sitting areas and a off betting area with pool tables and darts!! Fun place to visit if you are a Packers fan!!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you're a Packer fan! We love coming here on the weekends for the games. It's a great atmosphere and they often will do drawings for different Packer items. I won an official Rodgers Nike jersey! Being away from Wisconsin for game days was a tough pill to swallow but this place makes me feel like I'm back home! Get here early though, it gets extremely busy on game days!  They also have a HUGE menu and the food has always been great. They do have a smaller menu for game days but there are still plenty of options to choose from. The drink specials are also really great, $2.75 domestic bottles so you can't go wrong.  I've had the pizza here several times and it's always been delicious. This time I tried the French dip and the flavor was insane. I was very impressed."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE BARTENDER. We will not be back.  We stopped in on Tuesday, March 14 about 7pm. The young, thin bartender said hello. We sat at the far end of bar, then he proceeded to ignore us for the next ten minutes because he was sitting on the beer cooler, talking to 4 friends. I leaned over a couple times to see if I could catch his attention. Nope. So I walked down to where his friends were sitting and stood there (not in an a-hole way...just in a hey there, I'm here way)  He continued to talk to his friends. I finally turned to walk away and I heard him say oh I'll be right there. Another few minutes passed and still he's chatting up his buddies. We left and spent our money (and a lot of it) at another bar. We are not a-holes...we've both worked in the service industry, so we \"get\" when you are busy. This guy was not."}
{"text":"If you're a Packers fan then this is the bar for you on football Sundays! If you are not a Packers fan it's still a great bar any day. When I found this bar/restaurant for my cheesehead girlfriend a couple years ago, we were both surprised to discover what a fun atmosphere and delicious food it provided.   Pretty much every dish I've tried has been great. The prices are good and they offer many drink and food specials throughout the week. My top recommendation is the cheesesteak (and I'm from the Philly area). It is the best I've had in the Phoenix metro area and I've tried a number of places. Also surprising was the Mexican food here is good too and one of the nights they offer them at half off."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here as I have been born and raised in Wisconsin was happy to find a packer bar as I had just moved to Arizona. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar received poor service, never was asked for refill or another drink, took about 40 minutes to get our dinner order and about 15 minutes for our boxes for food since I wanted to just go home and watch the packer game streamed online. Yes, it's preseason and I understand that not every broadcast has it but if you are a PACKER bar shouldn't you have ALL the games?!?! Frustrating... I had a lot of hopes especially moving from Wisconsin but might need to find another pack bar."}
{"text":"Casey Jones is by far my favorite sports bar in the valley, if not over all! First and foremost the food and drinks are not only outstanding, they are extremely reasonably priced. The only thing better than the flavor and freshness of their food, is their prices. I've had a lot of my best meals at Casey Jones and my entire family agrees. We simply cannot stay away when we're looking for a delicious, inexpensive bite to eat. However, Casey Jones is not only good for the food, drinks, games and OTB. It is such a fun place! There is nowhere I prefer to do my football Sundays. There's a total sense of community at Casey Jones, kind of a modern day 'Cheers.' I HIGHLY recommend Casey Jones to any and everyone."}
{"text":"Seems like a cool joint. Very big place, cheesesteak was great, wide music genres playing, lots of tvs. Homey energy, feels like a nice neighborhood bar. Cool model train overhead in the main bar area. Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Waited just under 15 minutes adn walked out.  Not very busy.  No one said hello or greeted us in any way.  Go somewhere else- not worth it! Set up is weird. If it was busy, you could certainly never play pool.  You would be hitting everyone."}
{"text":"Oh Casey Jones, how you have failed me. I remember when I first came across you, free UFC, decent bar food, which included delicious fried cheese curds and jalapeno bottle caps. You even had decent beer prices! Terrible selection, but the price point was fine.   Recently though, things have changed. I'm guessing an ownership change.   New menu, which is ugly by the way. If you're not going to hold onto any of the train motifs in the menu, then why keep the thing on the ceiling?   Completely new and inept staff with glassy eyes, who don't seem to care at all. When I ask for tea, don't bring me Diet Pepsi with a lemon in it.  Annoying announcements 5 times in one night (yes, we know you're offering $4 Yager crap drinks, please stop reminding me, and no, having a child yell \"get some\" isn't cute. It's probably illegal.)  Understaffing the bar when there is a fight, so your servers are overworked and stressed, leading to problems & unhappy customers.  Serving cold food and pizza that tastes like dishwater.   I can't find one thing I like about you anymore.  I'm going elsewhere."}
{"text":"First off, like what Daren below me wrote, there are 2 Casey Jones's. One offers up free UFC, and this one offers up an incredible local beer selection , and some decent food to go along with it.   It's a sports bar, and it does it well. And they carry everything, including stuffed pizza sticks, nachos, and my personal favorite, fried cheese curds.  Yes, fried cheese curds. Balls of wonder.   Go for the beer, the tv's, and trivia on Thursdays.   Parking is horrific."}
{"text":"Every Friday I am here with the company. This place is always freaking good. By far best bar-food - always consistent."}
{"text":"Truly a Packers fans heaven! I love watching the games here and gladly make the 30+ minute drive from south Scottsdale. I've only ever eaten appetizers but have never been disappointed. This place is packed on game days and the service is still always great, which can't be said for most places!"}
{"text":"Total Packer Bar!  This place has become the default Phoenix bar for cheering on the Packers.  Every TV (and there are many) is tuned to the Pack on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Awesome Packer bar and restaurant!  There's tons of seating, very attentive staff, great drinks and cold beer. Bonus, the food is really, really good!!  I had the seasoned ground beef taco salad, and it was delicious, the best I've had since we left Chicago. Husband ordered the cheesesteak with grilled onions, he said it was like he had when he lived on the east coast. I stole a bite, it had plenty of sliced ribeye, which was juicy without being greasy. Plus the fries were crisp and actually seasoned!  I feel like since we've moved to Phoenix, restaurants are overly cautious about seasoning food (for the snow birds I'm sure), that it's been on the bland side at places. Not at Casey Jones Grill, very well balanced.  The prices were fair, $32 and change for dinner for 2 with a couple pints of beer. Great place, the only drawback might be the parking, as they share it with a pretty busy strip mall.  So you might need to walk from the next parking lot over, but that's a small price to pay. We found our new go to spot, and I couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"Casey Jones has pretty good food and a decent beer menu. While there are remnants of the old railroad theme it is now predominantly a football grill. The new spicy chicken sandwich is particularly good and, unlike many other 'spicy' offerings I've come across recently, is actually rather spicy."}
{"text":"Its a PACKER BACKER BAR!!  Packer themed drinks and cheese curds. Of course, game nights filled with green and yellow. Sipping on a sweet packer punch drink.  Had the turkey club in a spinach wrap, it was stuffed. Cheesesteak meat finely cut with melted cheese on white hoagie bun. Added grilled onions.  Loved the overhead trains! Love those things!!  Great service, easy parking and fun comaraderie!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for as long as I can remember. So naturally, when my boyfriend (from the Midwest) wants to try a midwestern bar & grill, I suggest Casey Jones. The staff was very attentive & we were greeted with our order taken quite quickly. My drink was made wrong & my server quickly had it fixed. My burger was also more rare than I had ordered, but it was still delicious & came out in a timely manner. Other than those two mix ups, this place is decent. 4 stars overall from the Cowboys fan :P"}
{"text":"This place isn't perfect, but it satisfied our needs. To celebrate my husband's birthday with friends, we wanted to end the night at out friend's hookah lounge. So I scoured Yelp for a nearby place for food & drinks to start the night off. We came on a Saturday evening, around 5, to take advantage of happy hour. We had quite a group and our waitress was very accommodating. Our bill was split so many different ways and it was a pleasant surprise that they didn't tack on a mandatory gratuity. Service was quite slow, though.  I was pleased with the food and drinks. And the happy hour prices were great. I even think we were charged HH prices for a few drinks past 7pm. The wings were good and the burgers were tasty, but what really impressed me was the sweet potato fries. They were incredibly awesome and I would return just for them!   They had live music, but it wasn't that great. The first act, a solo woman, did not entertain at all. She had quite a few spectators, friends I'm guessing, but had a very monotonous voice and all the songs sounded the same. I didn't mind that she was there, but if the music wasn't played so loud, it would have been better. The second act, a small group, was much better, much livelier.  Casey Jones has a couple pool tables, video games, darts, and an air hockey table. After eating, we migrated to that area and got to horse around a bit. For a Saturday night, it wasn't too busy. There isn't much parking in the front, but I think there is more around back. All-in-all, a good time and my husband was happy to celebrate with all his friends."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great deals and menu, cheese curds are incredible!! Love coming for football games!"}
{"text":"My father has been going there for years and I have met him there. I recently started going there on my own and found it to be an excellent place to hang out or eat. They are a sports club that actually shows hockey games, WOW what a concept. I've also enjoyed singing karaoke there and now they have free comedy shows to. The food is also great and priced fairly. I found a new place to hang !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place seemed like it would have some good bar fair considering there a midwestern themed bar. Couldn't be further from the truth. Food was frozen for probably months had that freezer burn taste to it very gross. The service is rude and could care less about your visit or what you think about the food. Left a 10% tip and I'm still pissed about that and wish I left a penny. Do yourself a favor and go to any other sports bar anywhere it will be a much better choice I promise you."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this places I am surprised.  I just expect it to be bad but the food is actually really good. I have had a salad, a sandwich, and a melt. All were good good. : ) The service is always friendly to boot."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend mentioned this place as being a pretty cool place to go.. \"back in the day.\"  I guess things change right?  We were looking for some place that we could sit and hang and eat some yummy fried food.  Ahhh Casey's was the place.   She was sold because drinks were only $5.  Cant beat that.  I nursed my Diet Pepsi while she drank a lemon drop martini.    We started off with some wings that tasted like they were a few days old and heated up.  not the greatest.  We also tried the cheese sticks.  I hear the old ones from back in the day were pretty damn good.  Unfortunately they did not have them.I also got a sandwich on a croissant, but yeah.. I think it was sweet bread.  So the food wasnt great at all really.. however our waitress was really cool, so I'll give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I set aside my lifelomg hatred for the Packers (being from MN, go Vikes!!!) to write this fair and honest review. Packer Nation aside this place has a pretty good vibe. The bartenders are all attentive, competent, and attentive. The food is pretty much standard bar fare but its good and even better after youve had a few. I will say the younger waitresses can be pretty rude and unprofessional but thats pretty standard i suppose. They have a happy hour and reverse happy hour m-f, reverse happy hour saturdays, and all day happy hour sundays, half priced apps, pizzas, and wells are usually fair game and reverse happy hour offers shots and premiums for reduced price as well as some of the menu items. I frequest this establishment both as a pregame go-to before my inevitable Charlies appearance, and sometimes have so much fun I end up staying till close. Definitely recommemd, theres a mixed crowd here in every way possible and thats what makes it so fun."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant/bar ever since I could walk and I am now feeling so grateful to write the best review I can of this wonderful place!! They make the BEST wings in the Valley! Since wings are a HUGE part of my life, I don't mess around when I say the BEST wings!! Their spinach con queso is another great appetizer, served with fresh tortilla chips, this is enough food to feed 2 good size people (you know who you are)!  To sum it all up: -Cheap Booze -Great Food -Huge TV's (about 20)  -GB Packers Bar -Every Sports Channel you can think of!!!  The epitome of a GREAT sports bar!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff. We will definitely be back. We shared a pasta dish and the fish and chips. Everything was cooked perfectly and have a very balanced flavor. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Received great service both times I've gone.  They have a killer happy hour, a billion TVs, and a cute little train cruising around the ceiling. Half order of nachos is huge (be forewarned), zucchini fries are crispy and delicious, and my bestie swears by their hot wings."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for sure!  This place is really cool, lots of booths and tables, a nice bar and killer food on the menu.   This is a Green Bay Packers bar so when they are playing the place is packed. They have TV screens everywhere with all different kinds of sports playing so when their isn't a packers game you can get a comfy spot.  The servers and staff are top notch. They have a train that runs along the ceiling of most of the place.  It's fun to watch.  We love to come here for the yummy drinks (they just added a new drink menu with awesome sounding fruity drinks - YAY!) and their Philly cheese steaks, which are big and cooked to perfection.  I believe on Thursdays they offer cheese steaks for a percentage off.  They have all kinds of things on the menu, not just bar food - pizza and wings, down home favorites, Mexican items.  There is a nice mix and I still haven't tried it all.  We love their potato skins and cheese curds.  Gotta have those since this is a Wisconsin bar - land of cheese!  My particular fave item to order is Chicken Fried Chicken.  You get two breaded breast pieces with white gravy, mashed potatoes with white gravy, a roll with butter and the best sauteed vegetable I have ever had at a restaurant.  I am not sure what they do to them but I thought about them for a week and had to go back again just to have them again.  This place is a mile from us and our favorite local hangout.  Be sure to get your picture with the Packers Bear inside by the entrance.  I love that bear.  Hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"Let me just comment on walking in. I was not greeted or even acknowledged and i stood at the front for 20min wondering if we seat ourselves or not. You would think there was a sign, nope. The bartender finally asked me what i needed and thats when i found out we seat ourselves. I grabbed a menu and silverwear and tried to pick out of all the empty tables the 2 that were clean.  You mean to tell me you have 3 customers and all your tables have not been clean off except for 2? Hmm. Its EXTREMELY dim inside, only light is from the window and a few in the ceiling, i can only imagine at night.  The onion rings were pretty decent, nothing special just a normal onion ring. Tender onions for sure, but the ratio between onion and bread sucks. Your mostly just eating bread, i couldnt even taste the onion or see it to be honest on some.  French fries. Terrible! I could not believe how gross and lifeless these were. French fries are not hard to do, really.. these were not even cripsy, just soggy and cold.. funny thing is the waitress set them down warning me they were \"hot\". These were not even luke warm. My onion rings were hotter than the fries and they came out before the fries? To be honest the fries tasted like they were microwaved, and that is such a big turn off.  CJ's cheesesteak, the big boy here. The cheesesteak i was surprised at how good it was. The bread was soft and fresh. Meat was seasoned great and it had a nice flavor. I would get it again if i ever came back.  I just wanna add in the ranch that they provide isnt the best and tasted REALLY watered down. I was upset because again, ranch is not a hard thing to do right.  SERVICE. This is a big miss. The waitress was friendly but never checked on me and also failed to provide refills.. again the place only had 3 customers in the whole bar including seating area..   All in all, i will not be back. I didnt even finish my food hardly expect for the sandwhich and left to finish eating something at home. I was not impressed with this place. $12 for a cheesesteak is way to high for the quality. Maybe they are great for beer, or game day, but on a regular day this is not a place i would come to eat at."}
{"text":"Love this bar. Mike is the best bartender here! Karaoke on Friday nights and awesome drink specials. I always have a blast here!"}
{"text":"Casey Jones has been a local favorite for many years! My family and I have come here many times and it's always been a good time.   Definitely one of the best places for wings in the area. They recently added hot dogs to the menu and the Chicago Hot Dog was awesome.   Menu consists of mainly bar food and beer but everything they serve is delicious. Great place to come to watch the game or hangout with family any time of the week. Plenty of TVs to watch and always fast and friendly service.  Don't pass up Casey Jones if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I've decided that this is going to be my new Sunday football hangout.    Nothing fancy, kind of a dimly lit place but they show all the football games, have a solid, good-quality menu, the burgers are decent, the prices are low, the service is top-notch and I can sit back, enjoy whatever game I'm watching and not be bothered.     I've been to their location on Thunderbird as well and this one by FAR is a lot better.     Not sure why it is, but the service seems better and the food sure as heck tastes better.   They make some pretty good BBQ here as well.     Not a gourmet dining experience but they live up to the expectations of a sports bar and then some."}
{"text":"One of the worst customer services I have experienced in awhile. The waitress didn't seem to care immediately after we got our food. Waters were empty and she even asked if I want another beer, I said yes and she said \"of course you do\". Guess what? I never got my beer and the only time after that she was interested in clearing off our table. Again still had empty waters and didn't ask if we needed anything else.  Although, I do have to say they had this song bingo game which was fun only to be ruined by the poor service.  Lastly the check. There was a comment card great i thought heres my chance to share feedback oh i couldn't because it was pre filled for us with \"excellent\" scores all the way down I have pics to prove it. Well I won't be visiting anytime soon. Thank you to the waitress Marci!"}
{"text":"This is my second Green Bay Packers bar I've been to since moving here.  It was nice to see the whole places decked out in Green and Yellow, and to sit among other Packer Backers. However it wasn't all that exciting. Which was strange because we'd finally won a game. So I expected much more celebrating.  But as the game went on, the place started to empty out. I mean people were nice, bartenders were okay, but I'll stick to hanging out at the other Packer bar I found. Even if it is 30 min away."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Their $2.00 taco Tuesday is worth the trip up there. great sandwiches and crispy fries and onion rings. Haven't tried the wings yet."}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. My son and I go down there to watch the football games during season. They are quick to make us happy."}
{"text":"Service was great! Wings were large, the sauce I got was a little on the sweet side but I'll get a different one next time. My son and husband fell in love with the boneless wings though! I also got a request to come back for breakfast! Hahaha"}
{"text":"The best Packers bar in town! Every touchdown they have the toy train go around the whole restaurant! Such a fun place and great food. I've been going here since I was little around 11 years old. Any day during the week is a good idea to go. All the staff is friendly never met a moody server. Almost tried everything on the menu and love it all. Only thing that is not fantastic is the parking which they can't do anything about so Oh well I've managed every time."}
{"text":"One of our regular and go to spots when we want a relaxed, good food, good beer experience.  They have finally started expanding their beer list from the regular domestic beers.  They have some local beer as well as Odells!!!  YUM.  Plenty of TVs to go around and a cute little train motif for the kids."}
{"text":"The worst place to eat.  The fish tasted like it was dunked in cold oil.  Greasy and soggy, yuck.  The waitress never showed up and ignored our complaints about the fish.  Had dinner and drinks-4 of us total.  Saddest hundred dollar bill I ever spent.  The exact opposite of the Casey Jones on East Bell Road.  We go there all the time and love it.  Don't confuse the two places!"}
{"text":"You cannot fault Casey's. Fabulous new healthy choices on the menu. Long pour from the bar, great specials too! Service is always predictably good and attentive. Place is clean, comfortable and well run. Give it a try. I have been coming for years and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service by Louie. Varied menu. Fun atmosphere and plenty of TV's to watch your favorite game. The staff was very welcoming and very friendly and efficient throughout the evening. I had the Thai skewers appetizer and the chicken wrap which were very good. On top of that, the prices are just right. It was my first time here and overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Friday Night Fish Fry and the Clam Chowder are Fantastic!  Good Service, neat place."}
{"text":"The great thing about Casey Jones is that you don't have to be a barfly or sports fanatic to have a great time.    While Casey Jones does offer the sports bar experience, it offers more than that too.   In fact, the majority people come for the great food and fun atmosphere.  Lots of appetizers are on the menu.  My favorite is the loaded potato skins.  My husband is a big chicken wing fan; he eats them until they're coming out his ears.  There are lots of burgers and hot sandwiches too.  I always order the Jalapeno Cheesesteak, thinly sliced beef, cooked with mushrooms, onions, peppers and jalapenos, and served with melted pepper jack cheese.  I'm not much of a drinker, but I know they have a full bar serving both the usual stuff and also specialty drinks.  They also have a huge variety of beer.  Prices are a great value and always several food, drink, or happy hour specials.   Casey Jones offers live music on special nights of the week.  This place is fun, not too rowdy, but a great place to hang out with friends and have a tasty meal.  (Because I want to be totally open, I need to say that I'm an acquaintance of one of the owners here, not close friends, but wanted to mention it in the spirit of transparency.)"}
{"text":"Great for Packer's games! However, I don't think I would go there for anything else. They actually have a pretty nice selection of tap beers and from what I saw, the food looked pretty standard. We had the nachos, which really didn't distinguish themselves from any other nacho platter I have had at a bar. The service was decent, given the fact that they were running a pretty full house during the Packer game."}
{"text":"Awesome little dive bar. Very relaxed atmosphere, fun crowd. Great service and while the food is not 5 star, it is definitely on the higher end of the \"bar food\" spectrum.   All in all, the chill atmosphere, great music and service keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"I love their cheesesteaks. And I love the beer on tap- it is the coldest beer I have ever had and I look forward to it. YUM! Wish they still had Sam Adams on tap though. ;-("}
{"text":"By far the best pulled pork sandwich ever!  It's called the Carolina.   The coleslaw was sweet and crisp with the right amount of sauce.  The pulled pork was so smokey and fall apart juicy.  The food was timed perfect and out within 15 mins of sitting down.   Service was fast and friendly.  And if your a packer fan this is the place for you.  Tons of tvs and the most Green Bay Packer Fans I've ever seen.   Looked like a sea of green!"}
{"text":"Nice drink and food prices. My gf and I order regularly from here, eating in and to go... everything is great. The bar is big and I've never had trouble finding a bar stool. Lots of tables/booths if you decide to eat there. Good job guys/gals!"}
{"text":"As a diehard Packer fan living in Phoenix, I have been going to Casey Jones' for 4 seasons almost every Sunday.  Each year has progressively gotten worse than the last.  Service is appalling, food quality is dirt poor (except for the wings), everything is filthy, and the hospitality, overall, is terrible.  A week ago I went in; it started the season off on a bad note... I even called the manager over to explain that I am a loyal customer and hadn't seen it this bad EVER.  He didn't have much to say as I gave him some gentle feedback on my experiences, he didn't even apologize or thank me for my loyal business.  I pledged to myself I will never drop another nickel in that place again after that.  Not even for a DIE HARD Packer fan..."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I had a Philly Cheese steak that was greasy and delicious. They have a pretty varied menu so you're sure to find at least a few things you like.  It's a bar so don't expect it to be quiet, especially on game days but there are lots of families who come here to eat."}
{"text":"Seems they decided to go back to their regular HH menu specials. Hurray! Funny how those poor management decisions always have a way of fixing themselves (one way or another).  All I know is I get to put Casey's back on my HH list. Yippee!  Still haven't been brave enough to order the potato skins again (see first review) but the wings (now 5 cents more) are always exceptional.  Friday night fish fry isn't all you can eat, but you won't leave hungry ordering either the 3 or 5 piece option."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for karaoke.  Brad is a great host and we will follow him to whatever place he has karaoke.  This place isn't horrible, but it's not that great either. It's your basic old dive bar.  It's a bit too bright in there for my liking, and it's set up more for lunch and dinner than singing and dancing.  I heard this place is a Packer bar and it gets pretty crazy for the Packer games.  If you're a Packer fan then check it out for sure."}
{"text":"I visit here regularly and get the cheesesteak. By far my number 1 favorite cheese steak in all the surrounding cities of Phoenix. all the food is great here, i try and bring friends when i can. love the atmosphere and toy trains moving about above everyone's head. lots of tv's and the staff has always been super awesome. everyone should try this place out if they are in the area, it's hard to be dissapointed. It's a true Gem.  The only complaint I have is that it's a Green Bay packers bar. We need more arizona cardinals bars!!! This is after all Arizona!"}
{"text":"Thank you! Warm and delightful. Even as a singular woman I was totally comfortable, good food and Jim was kind and attentive. Doesn't hurt that it's a green bay packers place."}
{"text":"Truly a local gem in the valley!  The only downfall is that it's a Packer bar, but that's a fact I'll overlook to have a small taste of the Midwest in the desert!"}
{"text":"Brayden and shaun Will def take care if you"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here because the Greek restaurant nearby closed early.  But, gawd, it was a Saturday night and the fact that I was in a giant megaplex urban sprawl of a city was very apparent when I noticed how desolate this strip mall location was.    We walked in and what looked like could easily be a very happening sports bar was dotted with a few customers here and there. We sat at the bar, but there were booths and tables to choose from.  There are pool tables, dart boards, and fooseball on the other half of the place and there are 2 sections of outdoor seating.  The beer selection was kind of weak, a bunch of your basic domestics, but Ithey did have Guinness and my Newcastle, but my heart sunk when the bartender told me that they were out of it.  The menu seemed like your average barfood fare, but I was drawn toward what turned out to be an amazing jalapeno cheesesteak sandwich with jalapeno cheese...mmm yeah! And my friend had the hot buffalo wings which, unfortunately, were not hot enough for my fire capacity.  I make it out to Phoenix a few times a year and I would come back to check out the \"All you can eat fish fry\" (my good diet gets completely thrown out the window when I come here).  And there were some other happy our specials painted on the windows that looked good.  I won't expect a song and dance from our bartender, although accommodating and efficient, possessed the antithesis of a sparkling personality.  I give this place the upper echelon of 2 stars cuz it seems like a place I would have torn up back in the day."}
{"text":"I've been going to Casey Jones for pretty much my entire life. I'm 29yrs old. It's been a family favorite for as long as I can remember.   The food is consistently great. They have the best wings hands down. I've never tried anything I didn't like on the menu. The employees are always friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming. Our 2 year old son loves going to see the trains. They will happily put whatever game you want on the tv near you. The patrons are friendly and it's easy to end up chatting with people sitting near you. Their specials are great and it seems there is always a special on something no matter what time of day you go.   This place is a true gem and we will continue to give them our business. We love you Casey Jones!!"}
{"text":"We only come here for two reasons. 1. To pregame  2. To play Buck Hunt."}
{"text":"Anthony was very nice man and the food was delicious I would come back again  is worth going to"}
{"text":"I had the philly cheese steak with mushrooms, onions, peppers, and fries. It was a lot of food and the sandwich was very good. The fries were pretty standard bar fries, still goo. Service was also good and attentive. I'll be back to try a burger."}
{"text":"The best bar and bar food around. I tried this years ago and was not impressed. But now that I move back in the area they have completely upped there quality in food! Amazing burger, spinach Queso dip I crave on a weekly bases. Pretzel with there house beer cheese is awesome, cheese curds are the real thing!  If there is anything I wish they would chant or update, is they need to do something about there Wifi. Also, they need to do like homemade French fries, not the standard ones in the big frozen brow bag.  But seriously this place is a much try and make it your home and local bar/restaurant to go too!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I'd rather just eat at the Cafeteria at work than at Casey Jone's Grill.  The food is average at best, the service is beyond slow.  The whole restaurant/bar needs to be pressure washed.  I won't be going back.  Nothing about it was worth the time or the money."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill the last few years,  not as clean as it used to be,  food is mediocre,  and the beer is not always as cold as I like... what happened Casey's???"}
