{"text":"My parents have been taking me to La Traviata sporadically for years, and this time around, I was more than pleasantly surprised.  I had the pescatore alla marinara, and it was delicious. The fish was perfectly cooked, and flavours in the sauce complimented it really well. You could taste the freshness through the ingredients and the portion size was just right. If you want a great dish of pasta like nonna used to make it, I would highly recommend La Traviata. Also, every good restaurant has a great vibe, and La Traviata didn't disappoint there either. The owner personally came to check on us, and the servers were friendly and attentive. I took my work colleagues there for lunch the following week, and had an equally phenomenal experience. I'll definitely be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"This is now my new favourite Italian place.  I just took a couple of friends to La Traviata to expose them to this incredible jewel in an assuming location.  The last time I was here was with family and wanted to expose my friends to this incredible find.

Started with Bruchetta, which was excellent as always and the tomatoes were fresh and juicy and the onions, excellent...a great starter.  My friends shared the portabello mushroom salad which was in their words...awesome.   I had the ceasar and that was great.  My friends had the salmon and the veal...in their words the best food they have had.

I am thrilled to expose them to such a fine establishment and I was even embarrassed by the low tip my buddy left so I had to top it up to 25%...the service, the atmosphere is just incredible.  The best part...they take reservations!!  There was a line up last night out the door.  People are standing up and noticing this fine establishment!

I recommend it highly and continue to patronize this truly enjoyable eating establishment.  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Recenlty had the pizza, and it was delicious. The pizza was so good, you could eat it cold! 
The new management is spectacular and very friendly. The waiting staff is especially wonderful."}
{"text":"Giving an excellent review with this restaurant. Great customer service and the food was deliciously cook. Really worth it."}
{"text":"Very good service, great food and nice atmosphere. It has that old Italian charm.

Not so good that it smelled like cigar smoke, but we got used to it or when the food got to the table it masked the smell.

Overall a great place that's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Came here after shopping at Yorkdale, looking for a small and quick bite to eat. At first glance, the place isn't much to look at from the outside. But we're glad we didn't let that prevent us from going inside. The restaurant was larger and cozier than its storefront let on. We were greeted by very friendly staff and excellent service. One of the waiters almost bent over backwards for us, accommodating our very particular pizza preferences (we wanted half the pizza with marinara and half with pesto), attentively refilling our waters and bread baskets, and just all around ensuring our dining experience was a good one.

And the best part? the food is AMAZING. The Mussels with White Wine was served with one of the best tasting broths I've ever had. Seriously - A MUST ORDER. Very garlicky and so flavourful, it goes great with all the table bread! Their pastas are a pretty classic take, nothing too crazy - just al dente pasta with hearty sauces. Perhaps most popular would be their pizzas, that come fresh out of the oven loaded with cheese and toppings. Hits those pizza cravings in all the right spots. 

Overall a great little spot - would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I went on a weekday evening, my friend and I were the only ones in there. 
The staff is extremely friendly. 
The food is amazing. I've lived in the neighbourhood my whole life and I can't believe I waited this long to try their food. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very generous portions,   the attention of the waiters is very kind and professional"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch after looking at reviews from Yelp and another site and we were glad that we did! We ordered the calamari fritti, minestrone soup, pescatore alla marinara, spaghetti with tomato sauce and veal parmigiana. Everything was homemade and delicious! We would definitely come back here and definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Both my partner and I are HUGE Italian food fans, and extremely serious about our carbs. The food here was pretty great. We ordered a pizza and pasta dish to share (the pasta was, as expected, perfectly al dente, and the pizza was good too, not the standard thin crust at Pizzeria Libretto type places. 

One thing was the wine -- it was completely warm. It's really starting to bother me the number of restaurants that don't properly serve wine at the right temperature. Red wine that has been slightly chilled for a bit tastes a world different from room temperature red wine and it's important, in my opinion. Other than that, nothing mind blowing here but everything mostly done well. I'll likely come back!"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough.

This place has some of the best lasagna I've ever had. Very fresh and tasty, like your Italian grandma would make. And a big portion too!

I've tried a couple other pasta dishes and been satisfied. Prices are reasonable. 
This place doesn't look like much on the outside, but it's definitely worth the wander inside. The servers are all very nice, older gentlemen."}
{"text":"First time dinning here with a larger group of people 10. We chose this establishment on the recommendation of Yelp diners. The food ordered was just as explained. Great Veal Parm the pizzas are to die for!  We will definitely be back!  Go and check this place out!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!. This is now my new favorite restaurant.  The food is truly amazing.  The  chicken parmesan is the best I have ever had. The Caesar Salad had a great dressing on it.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food, excellent service, and very reasonably priced. They have plenty of options and a good amount of customizability (every pasta dish can be gluten free or gnocchi, and I enjoyed mine with the latter). The tiramisu was also delicious."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a friend of mine last night. We went because he was in the area doing rock climbing so I figured why not give this place a try. First off, the restaurant is in a plaza and it can be easy to miss if you are driving along Wilson Avenue. The outside is a bit plain. However, when you enter, it has that old home character. The carpet is a bit worn, and the walls could use a fresh look. However, don't let the decor fool you. The food and service is good. I had the minestrone soup and lasagna. The soup had a lot of flavour. I guess this is how authentic minestrone soup is supposed to taste like. The lasagna was a large portion. I enjoyed it. It was simple, but again full of flavour. Our waiter was friendly and punctual. Our waters were always filled and the bread was always on the table. Overall, a good restaurant. On a Saturday night, it should have been full, but only about a third of the restaurant was filled. A place worth trying."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We ordered the bruschetta, chicken carbonara, and chicken parmigiana. Big portions. We came after the typical lunch hour and were met with friendly service!"}
{"text":"Excellent service each and every time we have been here, I have celebrated my birthday, my anniversary and have just come for dinner because it's a great local restaurant to have a nice meal and glass of wine  
The service is great the food comes out on time and the atmosphere is perfect for having a conversation over a meal.
I definitely recommend it to friends and family, we have been coming for the past few years"}
{"text":"I went to this location for lunch with my coworkers. The restaurant has nice amount of seating and the service was good. The person at the door and our server were extremely friendly. Our server was very quick in providing drinks... so the service was decent.

They started us off with some bread, it was quite good. For the main I ordered their Blackened Grilled Salmon with vegetables and Penne Pasta in rosé sauce. Lets start with the fish...Wow cooked well and not dry. The vegetables were good and the rosé sauce was very good. Portion size was good and to top it all I closed it off with a espresso shot. 

Overall an decent Italian restaurant with good Italian food!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for something near Yorkdale and we found this place. We were very impressed with this place! I ordered a pizza and she ordered the seafood pasta. The pasta came in huge portion and with lots of seafood. 

The pizza was cooked very well. It was perfect size for one person. They don't skimp out on how much toppings they put either."}
{"text":"I tried the place because of the good reviews but I ended up being disappointed. Soup was too salty, their carbonara is too bland (with nothing in it, just pasta and milk/cream) and the lasagna was okay but the presentation wasn't really nice. The person running it was really nice though."}
{"text":"The restaurant is under new management since the beginning of May. The new owner, Lanny is very nice, respectful and cares about his customers and the quality of the food and restaurant itself. 

I've eaten here multiple times having either the pizzas, appetizers, salads, lunch sandwiches or entrees and they are all absolutely delicious! The pizzas beat any pizza place in the city, the parms (eggplant, chicken or veal) are the best in the city and the sandwiches are hearty, filling and so good as well!

The waitstaff is very friendly and social, always greeting you with a smile.

5 stars, would recommended."}
{"text":"This is a family favourite of ours. The owner and his staff are very warm and welcoming. Food is always spectacular. The lasagna is wonderful.  Atmosphere is great and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem! People who know me I am very picky with my Italian food, but this place is really good! They keep it simple and flavourful. I don't like it when restaurants try to over impress you with their food especially with Italian food because it's all about simplicity here.

When we pulled up to the parking lot I was thinking..hmmm lets leave this place looks sketchy LOL but as soon as we entered the restaurant the ambience is really nice. It had a typical modern Italian restaurant feel you would usually take your family out for dinner on a special occasion. Stone walls, pretty light fixtures, dark wood furniture and white table cloth.

I ordered the Antipasto Misto for starters and it was all delicious. The right amount of sweet and salty to get our appetite going ;)
Then I ordered the Pescatore Alla Marinara which had Shrimp, calamari, clams, salmon & mussels with linguine pasta, all tossed in marinara sauce. OMG sooooo good :P
The sauce was perfect! and the seafood in this dish didn't taste or smell too fishy.
The Margarita Pizza was also ordered, but it was not all that great. I have had better. It tasted like a basic cheese. It was too cheesey. There was no presentation done on the pizza. I asked the server why there was no basil on the Margarita pizza and he said it was already in the sauce. I'd say excellent cheese pizza, but not so excellent margarita pizza :P
I don't want to give this place a 4/5 because of the pizza because it seems like a nice Italian restaurant. Maybe their other pizza's are better :D I'll give them another shot and return for another review."}
{"text":"We went to la Traviata tonight for the first time.  Food was delicious and a nice ambience. Wait staff were attentive but not too overbearing, which we prefer . 
Initially I was going to get the grilled calamari but we decided to share the small mushroom salad. It was amazing!  Simple but an amazing blend of warm sauté mushrooms on arugula and other greens. My partner had the special, grouper in a lemon sauce with capers and sundries tomatoes. The fish was perfect in a buttery lemon sauce. I ordered the simple linguine bolognese. It was perfect comfort food. I could see myself ordering again.  
We will return, and try other options on the menu. I am pleasantly surprised to have this restaurant close to home and will support this lovely family establishment"}
{"text":"Nice place. Good service.  I got the chicken carbonara, a little bland in my opinion. I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Was a bit skeptical seeing only one other review but then thought we'd give it a try since there weren't many other choices in the area. 

The place was really big and was pretty empty when we got there. But it soon become more busy by 8pm - still not full though. The decor looked a bit outdated but it was relaxing. The staff were very friendly. We ordered the veal capelloni and the lasagna. The veal dish was really delicious, saucy, moist, with great flavours. The lasagna was decent but certainly didn't shine compared to the veal. We'll be back if we're in the area again!"}
{"text":"Yet again, I have found another Italian hidden gem! 

If you have followed me for a while, you will know that I am on a mission to find the best veal parm! 

I probably passed by this place more than I can count and somehow finally ended up here!

There seemed to be a pretty decent crowd of people and we were able to get a table right away on a Saturday night. when we pulled up to the parking lot I was actually thinking, we would end up leaving because it seemed to be filled with regulars.

Plus I am not sure why, but this place kinda gave off the sketchy vibes, and that is one of the reasons why it took so long to actually give it a chance! LOL 

The wine was reasonably priced and the portions were very generous, needless to say, you will not be leaving hungry! Also the bread they serve was pretty good too, just make sure not to fill up before your meal arrives!

So obviously, we ordered veal parm and it was your average parm veal dinner. It was not bad,and I ended up taking half home because it was a decent size portion and made for an easy lunch the next day.

I would go back again, it seems to be a fairly decent place!"}
{"text":"Visiting the Toronto area on vacation and stayed near York and looking for something within driving range. Came across La Traviata and decided to give it a try based on it's decent reviews. Tried the Pescatore Alla Maranara with a little bit of spice added to it and was immediately blown away. Not to mention the service was excellent as well very friendly. Personally I don't think this place gets the praise it deserves would recommend to anyone in town."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Only thing that is sad to see is how they are an italian restaurant but have the front doors to the restaurant painted as the italian flag- but backwards. They painted it red, white and green when the flag is green white then red. Very small mistake that makes a big difference and is slightly distasteful for my (and perhaps their) culture."}
{"text":"This is the first time we are here and I am pleasantly surprised of the quality of food and the price are a perfect match and more. You definitely get your monies worth.

Service:
The wait service is excellent AND the owner if the restaurant comes and waits as well while greetings clients.

FOOD:
started off with a \"small\" Ceaser salad. This was not small at all ... lol two could easily share this.

We them had the grilled calimari.  Very good. Great taste and texture.

I had the chicken parmigiano.  A large portion with fresh steamed veggies. I had a choice of penne or potatoes, I chose penne. Now you may be wondering why only 4 stars instead of 5 ... well the tomato sauce for the pasta ... not as good as mine ... lol but a good comparible. The chicken was perfectly done and here the sauce brought out the taste of the chicken.

Overall:

We will 100% be coming back and I will be trying new foods from a great menu which has something for everyone.

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant always smells so good when I go by and has great reviews so when my wife and I were looking to get pizza, we thought \"let's try it\". We were quickly greeted and asked what we were looking at getting, my wife said \"A deluxe pizza\". I said what about size and my wife was looking at the menu and said \"it only comes in one size\". 10 minutes or so later I got the smallest pizza I've ever seen for about $16.  When I saw the box I told the person that I was expecting something larger and he just said it only comes in one size and that the menu say's it's 10 inches (I guess it's our fault then). I asked my wife and she doesn't remember seeing a size in the menu but either way you would think he would have thought it was strange that 2 people are ordering a personal sized pizza.
We ate and are now thinking of going elsewhere to eat. I'll post a picture to show the size of the pizza.  
FYI - pizza taste was great, but will never go back after that customer experience. If he had offered anything, he would have had a loyal customer.

{"text":"We went for a family reunion dinner and this place was such a surprise.Everything we ordered was so tasty,fresh and hot.From the mushroom salad to the lasagna to the pasta pescatore all were superb.I heartily recommend this place to any discerning lover of fine italian food.Please continue!"}
{"text":"What a spectacular find.

In a city full of truly outstanding Italian restaurants, this authentic gem is located in the most unlikely of places....  the scrambled mishmash of auto body shops and massage parlours that make up west Downsview.

By being out of the way, diners are able to circumvent the rushed atmosphere that spoils so many of the more well-known restaurants in town.   It's a place where you can sit back, relax and take in the multisensory environment that surrounds you.  

The high ceiling allows you to actually hear the conversations that you are a part of,  music is quiet and not overwhelming, there's little auditory bleedover.  

There's lots of interesting things to look at.   From the old Italian men dining alone, to the joy of family celebrations.    

The food is outstanding.   Fresh, hearty portions that are full of flavour. 

Our waiter was absolutely outstanding.    From telling us stories about his life growing up in Italy, to unexpectedly serenading us with song...  he truly made the experience above and beyond what we would have expected.

We're urban snobs.   Used to fancypants places with shining reviews.   

This is up there with the best.    

An unexpected gem."}
{"text":"Romantic find for a dinner date near Yorkdale area. Restaurant was a little empty but had great service and the food was pleasant.

Ordered the Olympia pasta and was able to easily switch to a rose sauce instead, thoroughly enjoyed this dish. We also ordered the Pescatore Alla Marinara which could have been a little more fresh but overall very good.

The decor was modern and classy with reasonable prices. Would come back here for another meal!"}
{"text":"This is now my new favourite Italian restaurant. Amazing service, great food, big portions, very affordable and a nice looking place. No wonder this place has great reviews. I find myself very fortunate to have found this gem right in my own neighbourhood which I never even knew it existed. My boyfriend felt like Italian and all the italian restaurants by me were the same. Limited pasta selection and same type of pizza. I really wanted to find a place that offered big seleclection on pasta because its something I don't eat often as well a selection of other choices. This place definately delivered on that. I had the Pescatore Alla Marinara which I changed the pasta to Angel Hair. It was so..... so..... good. My boyfriend had there Veal Parmigiana. Both mine and his portions were huge. For appetizer we their Bruschetta which was OMG so good. I can honestly go on and on because my experience was that good. On that note I will end this by saying you have to go here. Honestly if you want good Italian restaurant with big selection and great service ( which I'm anal on ) this is the place. Only question I have to myself is how did I not know of this place sooner?"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Clean fresh ingredients. The portobello mushroom salad was delicious! I highly recommend the espresso as well. All natural herbs and spices. Thoroughly enjoyed! Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Vivian D. 
My friends and I share the same birthdays, she had suggested that we try this place out because it was close to home. I was skeptical because it looks pretty run down barely surviving kind of place on the outside. Inside however; looks out dated, yet feels rustic and cozy. We were a party of 10 and each of us selected different items from the menu. I had the Bolognese and it was perfect. To my surprise; the food was delicious. Pasta was al dente, the portion was extremely big and a tiramisu for dessert--delish! The service was exceptional. Nothing like old world authentic Italian food. I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem with great Italian food and service. I came here early on a Friday night but it slowly started to get packed as the night went on. Make sure you make reservations early! For the seafood pasta they gave a good amount of seafood and you can tell they use fresh mussels. It was great. Along with the great service, we were given complimentary dessert as it was our first time there which was a great bonus. Will definitely come back and maybe try out their pizzas."}
{"text":"Great great restaurant...have been going here for years...under a different owner...never the less I continued to get the same amazing service...staff us very attentive...must try everyone is the portobello mushroom salad ...for our main entree we always ended  making our dish picking from different  entrees...wat I do miss is a grilled jumbo tiger shrimp the previous owner used to make me ....he said it was my special thing....and mayb an addition of a triple chocolate cake/cheese cake....it wud make a difference in the desert...it did enjoyed today's tirimisu. Cheers to the grappa!"}
{"text":"Have driven by this place a million times and finally tried it a couple weeks ago.  The food was really great, as was the service!  Really great for a night out or for families, great portions and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"This is old-school, quality, authentic real Italian home-style cooking.  I had the straciatella soup and spouse had the minestrone.  We also had the pasta which was perfectly al dente and the sugo perfectly seasoned.  This is the kind of place one goes to when you want real, wholesome, authentic Italian food.  You have to have time to savour and not rush through the meal.  The waiter who served us was nice, low-key and provided impeccable, professional service.  A place I would definitely go back to."}
{"text":"3.5

Had I reviewed this place a month ago, I would have felt confident giving it a 5-star rating - our server that first time was energetic/friendly, and the lasagna I ordered was quite possibly the best I have EVER had (see picture). 

My recent second trip here though was disappointing, which was a bit embarrassing people I had hyped up the restaurant (and lasagna) quite a bit to a group of my foodie friends who came with me. Perhaps it was the late hour, but my second try of the lasagna did not meet the initial expectation - it was drenched with sauce this time, which really diminished the taste all of the formerly beautifully constructed sheets of pasta and ricotta. Our server that night didn't seem too interested in making any changes after my friend and I mentioned the \"lasagna soup,\" so now I wonder which version of the lasagna was the fluke.

This place looks to have many other great pasta choices that are worth a look...and you may be lucky enough to have the 5-star version of the lasagna, rather than the 3. Hoping for a bit more consistency though the next time I swing by."}
{"text":"Got take out twice from here and both times were inconsistent. Both times I ordered the seafood pasta lunch portion for $13.00 and chicken pesto $12.00. The portions was ok, both times we got great slices of bread to go with our pasta. Downside to the meal: was first time the seafood pasta was amazing. Extra saucy for bread dipping just the way I like it. Second time ordering the sauce barely covered the pasta :(.

The seafood was just ok, everything was tiny from the squid, clam, mussels everything was tiny but fresh both occasions.

The chicken pesto was not as good.  Merely 10 minutes from picking it up, the pesto became very oily and the chicken was a bit dry.

I really liked the seafood pasta the first time I ordered it. Hopefully next time will be better."}
