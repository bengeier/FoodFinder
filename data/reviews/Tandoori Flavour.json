{"text":"This is really 2.5 stars. I was hunting around for a cheap lunch takeout spot near U of T, and this Tandoori Flavour is exactly that. Chicken biryani and samosas for $10.50 tax and tip included. The food comes in large portions with medium quality ingredients. The spices are slightly harsh and the chicken in the biryani had a bit of gristle. 

Given the previous reviews, I had my eye open for sanitation issues. I didn't encounter anything dramatic or worrisome. They have a clean inspection record since March 2010: http://app.toronto.ca/food2/index.jsp

The only seating is bar-style by the window and against the wall. The service was pleasant, and neither fast nor slow. 

In short, it was exactly what I would expect from a cheap, easy Indian takeout place."}
{"text":"This was truly the worst food I've ever eaten in Toronto.  I got veggie korma, ate about three bites, and threw it out.  It was inedible sludge.  

This restaurant actually has newspaper clippings of positive reviews in their window.  How is that possible?"}
{"text":"A-OK is accurate. It was my first time there, after living in Kensington for 3 years. Had always wanted to give it a try since the Indo-Pak place on Augusta had closed. I went in around 9pm on a Thursday night late September, and got the curry beef and rice.

The pricing is valuable. You get a fair portion for $6.50, tax included, and they take Credit and Debit.

The food was really nice and hot, temperature-wise. The beef seemed of fair quality, with no gristle. As mentioned in another review, the spices are not the best quality, but they're not bad. The food is decently spicy without being overbearing, but isn't exceptionally flavourful in terms of Indian food. Another thing I very much appreciated was the sauce-to-rice ratio, with enough sauce to coat all the rice. Seems like a small thing, but to me, it makes a huge difference.

If you're looking for a fair place to eat for a low price, and you don't want pad thai, Chinese, or Burger King, here is a good variance.

In terms of bugs, there were a few of those little flies with the feather antennae around the lights at the front service area, but even I had a swarm of those close to our basement apartment door with the florescent lights going last night, it's just that time of year/the area. If nature is the kind of thing that bugs you, you probably shouldn't leave the house, anyway."}
{"text":"The owners are really nice and the food is good and decently priced but I was REALLY disappointed the last time I was there. 

I walked in hoping to get my load of Indian food and it seemed they had some sort of an insect infestation! I swear on my life I am not making this up, there were HUNDREDS of flying bugs ALL over the place and it almost made me sick to my stomach that they didn't just close it down for one or two days to fix the problem.

The worst thing yet was that for some STRANGE reason, many people as well as myself continued to order and yet when I got home I could not even dare to eat the food. 

Regardless if they've cleaned the place up its a good takeout place for your daily dose of butter chicken and their naan is good but dear god I don't think I'm going back!"}
