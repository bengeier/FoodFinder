{"text":"I ordered a to go order for dinner right before they closed, thanks to late night working and indecisiveness. I put in an order for a Mediterranean grill selection with vegetables and a side salad. Along with their delicious garlic sauce.  The food was soooo good, and so much! I loved every bite! I will most definitely be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"One of my go-to restaurants.  Their gyro meat and chicken shish kebabs are delicious and their garlic sauce is addictive.  The schwarma and falafel are good too.  Delivery service is always prompt and the few times I've done pick up at the restaurant everyone is always very courteous.  Definitely my favorite Mediterranean type restaurant in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good mediterranean & Bosnian food you should definitely give this place a try. Saturday's they have a Buffett where you can sample almost all the main menu items if you're not sure what you like. Very reasonably priced and great service!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. The traditional food is authentic,  and they delivered a catering on a short notice and on time!"}
{"text":"Best cavapi, friendly service, fresh ingredients and owner is so nice. Came to our table and talked to us. First experience was successful. I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Love all their food! Amazingly good and fresh! Specially grilled vegetables-mmmmmNice people there, sweet and polite"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic, eastern ruro and Balkan cuisine.  Fast delivery, with hot tasty food.  We'll order from them often in the future."}
{"text":"Why aren't there actual Mediterranean olives?  Also there was no dressing on the salad. Gyro meat was good."}
{"text":"Wandered in there last night and was pleasantly surprised how good the food was.  The gentleman there helped me pick out a couple of things (cevapi and the trio appetizer) and quickly got my order ready.  Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Awesome Mediterranean / Balkan food! Got to check it out if in the neighborhood. Must try ?EVAPI There is also back room for private parties. Great selection of food, unique for Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Their falafel platter is my favorite. Rice and salad are really tasty too. Delivery is fast."}
{"text":"New owners new food. NOT as good. We ate here last November and loved the more Lebanese style Mediterranean.   The new owners are Croatian and Serbian and the food is definitely not as good. They changed the menu to make it more \"American\" including hoagies. Just confusing and a little disjointed   We tried the buffet it was a little bland.  The worst part was that they had on the menu at $12 but then charged $15 and pointed to a minuscule sign that was no where near the table. If the menu is wrong the server should just mention. Would have made a different choice.  They corrected but still not as good as the old Mezze"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. The workers there are the nicest people. Always polite, helpful, and accommodating. The food is delicious as well. I love their gyro and their buffalo chicken dip. If you aren't into Mediterranean food, they have great chicken tenders and fries!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food. My personal favorites are chicken shwarma plates and spicy hummus. I hosted an event in the back room and they were more than accommodating! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Again, another great hole-in-the-wall family run restaurant. I didn't come to the restaurant for the Mediterranean food, I came for the Bosnian food. I wasn't disappointed! I had the ?evapi platter that included sudzukic sausages. That's a lot of meat. The food took me back in time to my years in the Balkans. Remember to ask for the Ajvar as it sets off the ?evapi. This is a A BYOB, so find some Karlova?ka pivovara and your night will be set."}
{"text":"I had a gyro to go, it was good  except it was a little cold and the meat not like I expected but it was good. The owner is a very nice person who very personable. I had to wait a long time but I had time to kill. I will probably go back and eat in next time as I heard good reviews about it. I'm wondering if these are the same owners who changed the name?  Anyhow, I would def recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I always order so much food here, because it truly is that good. Everything from the falafel to the hummus to the shwarma was just so good and flavorful. Some of the folks working in there seemed kind of annoyed about customers, but there was a very sweet lady that served us and she genuinely seemed like she cared about our experience. I hope this place does well because I truly love the food here (and I can walk to get coffee afterwards!)"}
{"text":"I had the falafel salad and it was perfect. the falafel itself was some of the best I have ever had; I can say it even beats Aladdins across the street. it went well with the light and crispy veggies, and the dressing I had was a mixture of olive oil, spices, and vinegar. I was pleasantly surprised by how great that was as well! A wonderful vegan find in the mt. Lebanon area. the staff was very friendly as well.  My only complaint was that I was here during some of the coldest days of March, and I nearly froze sitting there as people came in and out of the door. Not much that can be done about that other than ordering hot food and making the most of it!"}
{"text":"The place claims to be under new ownership and it shows. The last time I was here, it was awesome. This time, It took over 30 minutes for a gyro and fish sandwich. The gyro was very bland - the sauce was below average and the tomatoes were not close to being ripe. The fish sandwich was ordered plain with no veggies, cheese or sauce. It come out with tarter sauce all over it.   Won't be coming back - that's for sure. Do Simple Greek or Alladins for a much better Mediterranean meal."}
{"text":"I did not taste the food because I left before I made the order, but first, this is not Lebanese. Second: they told me to have a seat, then they brought the menu, and I kept on waiting while they were chit chatting behind the counter, an older waiter and I think it was the owner. By the way, they are not welcoming at all... you go in and they don't even talk to you... they should not be in the restaurant business period."}
{"text":"Awesome Mediterranean food delivered fast!  This is one of my go to delivery places. The Falafels are delicious. My favorite meat is the Gyro. I usually get a Gyro platter and a side of Falafels. They have really tasty sauces to dip everything in.    This places delivers super fast. Try it - you'll love it!"}
{"text":"The falafel was moist!! The hummus was very smooth and tasty. The house dressing is also good! My only comment would be to tzaziki with the falafels! Everything was delicious! I also had the Buffalo chicken dip! Very good!!"}
{"text":"Everything was great and the staff were super friendly. They have several Bosnian dishes which were excellent. Highly recommended! We will definitely be coming back. They also deliver through grubhub."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in mt Lebanon. It is always super clean, and the staff are friendly and accommodating. On two occasions I have been there and the owner has been semi rude (ignoring customers and not interacting with them even when talked to). They have the best chicken kebabs I've ever had. The dip trio is amazing. They have a small outdoor table that I enjoy eating at when the weather cooperates. This restaurant is located right next to the uptown parking garage. This restaurant is byob. They have a hot food buffet on the weekend, which I have never tried, but would like to!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for take out lunch.  Ordered the goulash on rice.  I enjoyed the goulash, it was flavorful and filling but nothing special.  The staff are very friendly. Next time would like to try the cavapi."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, but Kind of a strange take on Mediterranean food. The shawarma was not quite shawarma and the gyro was not quite a gyro.  It was very hot inside, almost stiflingly so. The service was quick and good. Overall, Not bad. Maybe better as takeout."}
{"text":"Really tasty food!! Great service and a real family business. I really like the chicken shawarma and baklava."}
{"text":"I can't say enough nice things about this restaurant. Great food to start. I have enjoyed everything I've tried here. The service is always kind and friendly. The restaurant is very inviting and everything is prepared with care. It's becoming increasingly hard for me to not stop here every time I walk by."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal and the portions are fantastic. I get the dip trio and chicken kabobs -and they are the best in the area. The kabobs come with a garlic mayo that is to die for! Surprisingly, delivery is just as good. I look forward to coming here at least once a week - it's that good!"}
