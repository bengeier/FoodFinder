{"text":"Long time established icon of New Kensington. I grew up a block away and went to Eazers almost daily. Family owned and operated, a must \"see\" attraction of downtown New Kensington. Probably the only place I recommend you go in downtown New Ken.  Art was a friend of mine and is sadly missed as he was the owner of Eazers. His son Artie runs it now. If you have a crave for syrian food, this is the place for you.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Hometown landmark. Been going to this place for 35 years. Good food, try the Syrian food items. Art the owner was a great guy, his son runs the place now. Great family run place."}
{"text":"Not many people have probably heard of New Kensington but let me tell you, there is one big reason to find out how to get there....love those Eazer burgers!!!!   Wishing they delivered but I guess California would be considered a little out of area....."}
{"text":"Greek salad with Greek dressing is delicious  I'm addicted, could eat this salad everyday"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Friendly, family oriented and just like home away from home. Reasonable prices with large amounts of food. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"This is a family owned place for generations. When I'm in town I eat there as it's a part of my childhood. The service is friendly and the food in amazing for a small town restaurant. Since everyone in the town knows this restaurant, it makes for a great time catching up with childhood friends. When you are in town, make sure to stop in. I always fill my luggage with frozen\" feta spinach pies \" and enjoy them after I'm gone. You don't need a fancy, expensive restaurant to get this ambiance."}
{"text":"No doubt now one of my favorite places to eat in the New Ken area!  Walking in I felt warm/happy - like I was back in time ... visiting isaly's restaurant with my mom.  Cozy and inviting was the feeling!!    We chose a little booth along the wall and were greeted right away.  We were torn on breakfast or a cheeseburger.   There was so much on the menu..  took us some time to decide.   Gyro to breakfast to cheeseburgers etc.    I choose the double on Syrian bread!   It arrived.. just like the picture on the menu and was delicious.  I of course had bacon added to mine.   The sandwich was packed and surprising . .easy to eat and Hellmans mayo - oh yea baby.  The service was good and so the food was outta sight.   I cannot wait to return.  thank you Eazers!"}
{"text":"This place holds a place in my heart. Since i am new to working in New Kensington, my coworkers suggested that we get lunch here. After looking through the menu, i decided on the Eazerburger and curly fries. We called our order in and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. When you pull up to Eazer's it doesn't look like much, but those are my favorite kinds of places. We walked in the side door, and this place is basically a convenience store merged together with a little diner. It's definitely the kind of place that locals go to and love because the people eating their lunch we're having conversations with the cooks. Sadly i couldn't stay to eat because i had to get back to work.   Okay so the food: i got an Eazerburger, which is a double cheeseburger with your toppings of choice on Syrian bread. Syrian bread is basically a hearty bread cut into a triangle. I've never had it before, but it held up with the double cheeseburger very well. My curly fries were nothing special, but they weren't terrible either.  I totally forgot to take pictures, but I'll definitely be coming back here again. I will definitely post pictures next time!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent but the service is sooooo slow I quit going there their Greek salad is good and fish is crispy but once got breaded mushrooms that were cold"}
{"text":"This was my second time here, the first time was very good breakfast just not big serving and good service. The second was lunch took 45 min to get food not very big portions was alright taste. Will not go back."}
{"text":"The food is great but the table service is really lacking.  I've been in there a few times and the same lady is always working the tables.  She is really nice but she is very slow and it gets worse when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Breakfast is absolutely delicious here! The Syrian bread and ham were exceptional. Food takes awhile longer than chain breakfast places but that is because everything is homemade here. Will definitely be back to try their lunch and dinner menu!"}
{"text":"The food is good and cheap, but the service absolutely sucks and the whole \"roach running across the floor\" thing they've had going every time I've been there just doesn't do it for me. If they cleaned the place up and had some customer service training, I think they'd be great, but as they are they're trying to make cookies out of just eggs and flour."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant since I was a child. The staff is super friendly and helpful! It really is a diamond in the ruff. I love the hot roast beef sandwich and wedding soup! The restaurant is family owned and they make an effort to get to know each of their customers"}
