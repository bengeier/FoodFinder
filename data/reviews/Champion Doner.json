{"text":"Actually the best shawarma place in Vaughan!  Homemade sauces, HUGE portions, perfectly cooked chicken and amazing sauce!!  The prices are great. Give it a try for yourself and youll be hooked. Ive been there 5 times since theyve opened.   Be sure to get the Kunefe"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The moment till we walked in and out was such a nice experience.. everyone is so nice and the food you can taste it's made from scratch.. I tried so many Döner places but this one is so far the best one. So we ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken Döner plate. The chicken sandwich was very nice and the meet was very crispy so was the chicken Döner plate.  After we got done with the food they brought us tea on the house and it was so tasty.  This place is family friendly Definitely not the last time I'm visiting it. Will go soon again I would recommend it 100%"}
{"text":"Best Donair (it's not a shawarma - FYI :) I have ever had! I had the beef donair box with salad. The donair sauces are delicious. The beef shavings very nicely thin and moist. $6.95 plus tax - very filling. You can also get it with rice or salad. Definitely gonna return to try their other menu items. Service was friendly and fast. Salad ingredients look super fresh."}
{"text":"So I visit this place at least once a week if not two. The food is amazing and very good quality. The original staff is great. The only reason I'm giving it 1 star is because they hired two new girls who are rude and sloppy. I don't know if they are part of the family or not but it's unacceptable. So the girl with glasses who cashed me out was rude and unprofessional. Did not even acknowledge me. After sometime she just asked \"ready?\" As if she was annoyed. So I rolled my eyes and said \"yeah\" (I had been ready for 5 mins). The girl who made my wraps was a blonde girl with dark roots. She was so sloppy and acted annoyed every time I asked her to add something. If u don't like your job... quit. I will go back but I'm going to get one of the original ladies to make my wraps. I was so disappointed. Again The food and Quality is amazing!"}
{"text":"There is much improvement required. The Shawarma is not tasty and the toppings are not that great. If you're looking for Shawarma your best bet is to go across the street to Pita land.  The shwarma I ordered we're definitely not good and I discarded most of what I had left.  I give them a two out of five simply because they are new to the area. As for tasting quality I would have to give him a 1/5."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sandwich I've ever had! Had my first lunch here yesterday and came back again today! Doner Sammy is top notch. Extra garlic sauce and extra hot sauce is key. Meat was juicy, sauce was great. Homemade bun cooked same day was a nice touch also.  Service was both fast and Friendly. You really get the feeling they care about you and the food they're putting out. Will be back again.... tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Best Kebab in Town. Every bite was mouthwatering and absolutely delicious. I will definitely be back for a lamb shish plate."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch here. The doner felt authentic and the owner/staff were polite and helpful. I do have to sneer at the previous reviews however. This place has doner (Turkish) and does not have shawarma (Arabic). Presumably these people don't go to Spaghetti Factory and write reviews about its shanghai noodle or go to Sansotei and run back to inform Yelp readers about the spaghetti. The menu does not say anything about shawarma either! As I have said before, not everyone needs to 'write' on Yelp, but hey Internet...  Back to Champion Doner, whose logo looks like the owner wants to run a race track or mix horse meat into the food, where the meat was tasty, the bread (they offer sandwich, wrap or burger styles) was hefty and proudly home-made - and the quantity was large enough that I could not finish my combo. Speaking of the combo, it comes with a large salad and beverage like water or pop (yogurt drink is $1 extra unfortunately).  Many customers opt for hot sauce, which the owner offers, but that is not part of the original Turkish cuisine. Sadly, we are used to hot sauce with this, that and everything which dulls the taste buds and desensitizes the palette and of course is often inauthentic. I opted for the garlic sauce, which unfortunately was not thick or truly garlicky.  The atmosphere is pretty standard. The washroom is set up facing the restaurant and the door was left open for all to see. So choose your table accordingly. They also offer Turkish desserts and, aside from doner kebap, pide or the rough equivalent of a Turkish pizza.  This location turns over to a new business on a regular basis so let us hope this family can make a go of it, but looking at the long line of cars outside McDonalds and the murderous intent of parents towards their children one wonders."}
{"text":"Parking: This restaurant is located in a plaza so parking is plentiful.   Service: The staff all had smiles, were friendly and attentive.   Setting: The interior had about 8-10 tables, with comfortable chairs, a fireplace and television.   Food: My boyfriend and I tried the chicken shish plate and the beef shish plate. Both were delicious and not dry. The salad was fresh and colourful. There was complimentary warm bread.   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Good food in a clean environment. Great menu choices and excellent food. Fresh homemade breads along with plenty of toppings. Very busy at lunch but service is pretty fast. This establishment will do well here. I will definitely recommend it to my family and friends."}
{"text":"I stopped by to grab a bite and Champion Doner did not disappoint. I liked their Chicken Doner, but I felt kind of heavy and bloated afterward. I think it was too much bread. Next time, I'll go for the chicken + salad option with maybe a little bit of rice. The bread was too much in terms of carbs.  There's nothing to complain about. The service was great. The place seems clean. It's not the healthiest food, unless you go for falafels, but it does the job in getting you from \"hungry / possibly hangry\" to \"full\".  I wish their chicken was juicer though. I'm not saying it was dry. It wasn't, but it could be a bit juicier."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and in the mood for something different, Champion Doner was the perfect change from the usual Shawarma. After reading several reviews here on Yelp, off I went.   This is definitely not a Shawarma restaurant, although they do offer something similar called a \"Wrap\" to help those confused patrons who think its all the same. They clearly have Doner as their name nothing else. So a Donair was what I expected to see.   Walked in, they let me sample the chicken and meat, was told the Doner sandwich bread was made fresh on site (this seems to be a trend lately, and I do like it!). Decided on a Beef Sandwich and loaded it with all options.   The sandwich was fantastic tasting and huge, which I always appreciate since the price (12 dollars) fit what I received. I found myself unable to stop eating despite how full I was.  Overall, was very happy with the service, food and clean environment. I would definitely recommend giving CD a try.  I know I'll be back to try more!"}
