{"text":"Very disappointed! I normally don't write reviews but felt compelled.  After taking forever to take our order and to cook the meal, our food came.  I took a bite of my Berry Salad which was actually a salad with bacon and blue cheese.  I don't like blue cheese. So I started eating the salmon on top which was so hot it burned the roof of my mouth.  It still hurts! We were able to flag down the waiter, who apologized.  I asked for just the Berry Salad without the salmon and he brought it.  The salmon was good once it cooled down.  Other restaurants would take the meal off the bill or offer a free dessert but not the Burntwood Tavern.  An order of pretzel bread also came out terribly hot.  More like burnt mouth than Burntwood."}
{"text":"Been there a few times. I feel like I'm a bother at bar bc of barmaids. At least I did the couple times at bar. Good beer selection. Just not very exciting all around. Great music when chris hatton plays there though."}
{"text":"To a dish, everything tasted as if it was previously frozen. Service, marginal at best. Value, non existent."}
{"text":"One of the better places for Happy Hour in Solon. Great appetizers and drinks. Best was to be served by Sarina. She is so good and has a pleasant personality. The calamari appetizer was average. I have had better calamari. The blackened shrimp tacos were the best. We asked for lettuce wrap instead of taco shell. Super tasty."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I got the California chicken sandwich. My fries were cold which is a little annoying because I love fries. My husband got the Sicilian flatbread and it was a bit better than mine.   It is a pretty cool place to hang out because there is a nice restaurant area and also a bar area with TVs. We were able to get some decent food and also watch a football game. However, the food was just mediocre. For the price I would expect a little bit better.  Oh and the bathrooms were really dirty. Like I was tempted to give 2 stars dirty..."}
{"text":"Happy hour is a go. The clientele is slightly older... But for $5 cocktails and half price apps it's a good atmosphere. the dinners are overpriced for the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"I just had dinner at this establishment with my girlfriend before heading to a movie. I do not and will not recommend this place to anyone.   We sat at the bar and waited about 10 minutes for someone to come over. They were busy chatting with each other instead of customers which I could see if they were paying each other's bills. Once we did get menus they were for lunch and not dinner.   A male bartender approached us, took half of our order before deciding to clean his bar then came back to finish the rest of our order.  We had asked for Tuna nachos and a wedge to start and our entrees showed up first. When I questioned about the appetizers the male bartender proceeded to say \"yea guess you didn't get them huh.\" And he walked away!   I can easily say we will never ever be back. Just terrible terrible service. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, but over-priced, mediocre bar food. Chicken was dry, fries were over-cooked & too salty. Our waitress was pleasant, but service was slow (restaurant wasn't full).  Second time I've been here, same basic results.  I doubt we'll try again."}
{"text":"This place should be awesome. The other locations have amazing food. The first time we went to the Falls location it took forever for a server to come to our table, no water, no eye contact. But once the food arrived it was great and we were excited to come back. Second visit ruined it for me. The food was horrible. I actually ordered the same appetizer and a similar dish (flatbread) as the first visit and was shocked. Both came out cold. The staff were very nice and apologized but when they brought out our \"new\" flatbread it was our original one just microwaved! The 2 pieces we had on our plates were still missing and the whole thing was soggy!!! I recommend waiting 6 months before trying this place. They need to figure stuff out before its worth your money. Hopefully it improves. I want to love it."}
{"text":"I have tried this tavern twice now. First when it was new and then today. On my first visit I had the fish sandwich. I thought it was ok; but The Pub's (the previous restaurant) fish had been fantastic, and this was not nearly as good.   Well, a year later I decided to try Burntwood Tavern again; I ordered the \"Reuben sandwich\".  I suggest changing the name as I know my Reuben sandwiches and this definitely is not one. When it came to the table it was about 14 inches long and the corn beef resembled loosely ground, sweetened hamburger topped with  slaw (softened cabbage) instead of sour kraut. This avant garde interpretation just doesn't work for this Clevelander.  It is basically a squished loaf of bread with melted cheese and a sprinkling of corned beef on top with a thin layer of sweet cabbage pushed together to make a sandwich.    All said and done 1 1/2\" inches thick -- come on this is Cleveland -- the 3\" minimum applies.    WHERE'S THE BEEF? Not at Burntwood Tavern to be sure.  This place is simply overpriced for what it offers.   I do not plan on returning, however if you're in the area I would recommend trying one of the other restaurants around beachcliff -- Tartine, Sweet Melissa's, Stino da Napoli, Pearl of the Orient, Market or Beachcliff Tavern.  If you're going to eat out in Rocky River you should choose one of these restaurants as they offer a much better value for your dollar."}
{"text":"Et here quite often, it is always on point. The food is great, the service is amazing, and the drinks are delicious. This is also my grandmother's restaurant of choice. Our last visit we had the best experience of them all, our waitress was Olivia, and I hope she as appreciated as she deserves to be. By the way my grandmother and myself would love to have lunch with you one day as well."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Tastes like gross fast food in a nice setting.  If you like chain restaurant and rich, unhealthy food you might really like this place.  As a caveat, I am picky with what I eat and try to eat clean...  My experience:  Had the harvest salad (subbed the veg burger for chix) and after my first bite, I immediately did not want to eat anymore, but felt awkward because I was with a group.  Though some may like the house dressing, it was way to oily for me.  I cannot imagine what they put in it, as it tastes like it exceeds the calories and fat in any other dressing I have ever had.  Their dressing ruined a perfectly good salad. The veggie burger was ok; nothing to rave or complain about.  Ended up eating as little as possible and pitching the to-go  as soon as I got home.  The apps that were ordered were also super greasy and gross (tots and zucchini frites served with lots of mayo sauces).  Pamela the server was ok.  The food was just not what I want to put into my body."}
{"text":"We frequent the bar and patio for the atmosphere. The food is average. The best thing to eat here are the pretzel breadsticks, which are free!! However you have to ask for them."}
{"text":"Outstanding food- Robin (our server) and Bill( the manager) took great care of us. The tavern chips and gazpacho was the best we ever had.  The place was packed and our food came out hot and ready. Everything was prepared as we expected it. Service was great."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. I wasn't a fan of the tavern tots but the fries tasted homemade and delicious. I'm generally a picky person but their California grilled chicken sandwich was pretty good. They also have pretzel rolls (although it's not on the menu) that are good. They just need a cheesy-like dip but overall good food and great service. Our server, Jojo, was so attentive, helpful and awesome! We'll be back."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Cleveland we stopped to eat at the Burntwood Tavern in Solon and Chagrin Falls, Ohio.  Both places we're very nice looking and very busy.  Despite the crowds we were seated fairly quickly and had an enjoyable meal both times at both locations.  The food is good - not great but there are some really good options including the smashed potatoes and the salads.  The burgers are good and the flat breads are also nice.  The Solon location is much larger and has a great outdoor eating patio.  The Chagrin Falls location is smaller but very tote active and also has outdoor eating."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food was average. Manager ( male, short with dark hair) was rude. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Very poor rating if I could give them 0 stars I would. My girlfriend and I were in Burntwood Tavern on Saturday night. My girlfriend ordered a fish sandwich nothing special for the price that it has, I ordered a french dip sandwich, it was totally raw. I told the waiter about it, she took it back to heat it up, once she brought it back I told her that I am not in the mood for it anymore, and that she should take it off the bill. The manager ended up ordering another sandwich thinking that would make me forget about the first one, I did not trust them with my food anymore. You would think that a popular restaurant like burntwood tavern would have decent cooks that care enough to check if the meat is done before it is served. Don't waste your money on burntwood tavern."}
{"text":"I tried out this place with a few of my buddies. It has a great location looking out over a beautiful river which they capitalize on nicely by providing plenty of windows for spectacular views. The food is great, I recommend the pork wings, shrimp tacos, and they make a killer burger which all comes out of the kitchen at lightning speed! The staff is nice, friendly, and very helpful. I absolutely recommend Burntwood Tavern."}
{"text":"Went there New Year's Eve and had the Haddock special and it was just delicious. Loved the way the fish and potatoes were prepared. I wish this dish was included in the regular menu, as it's a winner.  The staff at this location is extremely warm and accomodating; from valet to the manager to the service staff, it  is top notch. Excellent management. I've been a long-time diner and have never been dissapointed. I can't say the same for the other Burntwood locations and I wil always return to the Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I have been  to 2 other locations during their opening phases and did not feel any growing pains like I did with this location. The staff is clueless and I'm not sure they really want to be enlightened. I had ordered 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad for lunch, to go $9.00. They had placed the hot sandwich in a box next to the cold salad. The salad was not cold anymore and the bread in the sandwich was soggy. I was so looking forward to this location being close to my work but after today I really don't think I will be back there...."}
{"text":"First, this place is gorgeous!  The patio- incredible!  The menu- awesome! The food- nothing special.  The service- bad.  Now, BECAUSE this place has a great atmosphere and a great menu; I want to LOVE it, so I've tried it THREE times.  Being in the service industry, I realize that maybe the first bad experience is due to the kitchen and/or the server having an \"off\" day, but three different times is a little harder to justify.   If you are going to have a host-stand, that usually means that you have to wait to be seated.  All three times I've gone into Burntwood, I've waited and waited and waited at that host stand, until finally a manager came over and sat us. If you are going to have burgers on your menu, please know how to properly cook one to the specified temperature.  If you are going to have salads on your menu, please provide an accompaniment of dressing.  If you are advertising menu items that are traditionally served hot, please make sure they are not cold.  If a guest sends back a menu item for any of these reasons, a server should not make you feel uncomfortable about doing so and a manager should at least make a table visit.   As a guest coming into this establishment, it seems as though the staff is just not happy about being there- and that's a shame, because this place has great potential, but shouldn't forget that they are in a location surrounded by other restaurants competing with them."}
{"text":"Consistently, very good food and beer selection. Great happy hour. Kid friendly space. I've only been to the Rocky River location one time and the service started out promising and nose-dived from there. That is the only reason I didn't give them 4 stars. Our server was so obsessed with the efficiency and accuracy of the food delivery to each person in our party (12 people) that silly demands were made of us, like we weren't allowed to change seats. Our party was comprised of family members who see each other very rarely and there was no way I wasn't going to chat with everyone. I changed seats and the server was not happy that I didn't follow directions. Seriously? Everyone enjoyed their food and drink, though. The host was delightful."}
{"text":"We just left, we have been there many times but this time we could not leave fast enough. Sitting by a table we're adults at one table kids at another. Kids were out of control loud and running around. I will never go back as management did not step in. We left way before we would have. Bad experience."}
{"text":"It's okay.  Still a work in progress. Overall I enjoyed both my visits to this Tavern/Restaurant.  Very nice environment but not stuffy. If I were the manager I would make two changes, first of all I would find a way to moderate the volume of the background music so it does not interfere with conversation. Secondly, and this is very important, I would take the asiago Parmesan encrusted chicken off the menu. If the kitchen can't get it right, and they surely did not, it's not worth risking your reputation on something so poorly prepared."}
{"text":"Went in for drinks.  Smelled terribly. It's like they mopped the whole place down with dirty mop water. Service was ok, but the smell was seriously unbearable."}
{"text":"As a lifetime resident of the Falls, I have been to all of the different incarnations of this facility and Burntwood is the best. I have had dozens of meals here both lunch and dinner. FANTASTIC! food sometimes is better than the service, but great happy hour prices for the good quality.   Yum."}
{"text":"This place is in a great location. The drinks were delicious and they have an excellent selection of liquor and beer. However, the food left a lot to be desired. I had an asiago crusted chicken sandwich and it was tasteless and bland. The fries were average however the tots were delicious. The service was not fabulous either and it was slow. My drink did not stay full.    There are so many exceptional restaurants around the area that I will not waste my time or money here."}
{"text":"Mostly on weekend my husband and I love dining at the Burntwoocd Tavern. We are usually greeted by their charming hostess, Kim, who will go out of her way to make our time at Burntwoocd pleasant, and the friendly waiter Tim from England who anticipates our every need.  I highly recommend the Burntwoocd Tavern restaurant to anyone who wants fine dining, impeccable service and delightful ambiance. Marie-Therese"}
{"text":"The worse service I've experienced in Cleveland. Full stop. Could barely get server to pay attention to us and then we had hosts/hostesses harassing us to leave (even though our server had told us we were fine where we were). Never again. If this is how they treat paying customers..."}
{"text":"I don't usually comment on this site, but I hope that management reads this and does something about it. This is a beautiful place with one of the best views in NEO. I went in there on a Saturday afternoon around 2 for lunch. We sat at the bar. The bartender tried to help me pick out a beer which was nice. The problem was she didn't know anything about them. Im ok with that. The food was good, I had fries with my sandwich that did not come with ketchup. I watch her for 10 minutes, to try to have her turn around to get her attention. The bar isnt that big.  I finished my sandwich before I could  get her to look at me. I watch as she looked at a cheat sheet everytime someone ordered a drink. It was painful to watch. You could of put anyone back there and did a better job. I don't need my hand held when I am out but this girl wouldn't smile wouldn't  check back wouldn't ask how things are? You can make up for your lack of skill by at least being nice. I sat next to a girl at the bar that was also a bartender. she couldn't believe this was happening as she was holding her empty glass try to get another drink. The one thing I could not help but notice was a bag of cabbage she wrapped up when I got there that she left on the bar. 2 hours later that cabbage was still there.  The manager finally came over and helped, thank god. He was now asking people for there credit cards to start tabs. This was a older crowd of 40 year old+.  I don't know of any other bar or restaurant in Akron that does this. Its very un professional and low class. We aren't at a campus bar ordering shots for gosh sakes. FYI people that are ordering $6.00 beers and $12.00 cocktails generally don't skip out on a tab. People are put off by that. Just letting you know. Your job is to keep track of things like that.   Im writing this to fix things not to be a jerk. I hope someone at corporate see's this and corrects the problem, otherwise you just spent alot of money on that place for nothing."}
{"text":"Overall, a bad experience. The staff and service can be described as amateur, at best. We had reservations for six individuals. While we arrived early (one hour before due to a schedule change with an event we attended), we did ask if it was possible to get a table. Rather than attempt to accommodate our request, the staff was rude and unwilling to see if any tables could be arranged to seat us. Accepting that we had reservations, we decided to wait. While waiting, we counted at least a handful of tables that sat, unoccupied for over an hour. When asking at our reservation time time about our table, we were told they were simply waiting for a table to clear. Again, there were empty tables for the one hour we waited. When our table was called, we were take to the empty table we looked at for the past hour. The host did not demonstrate the simple ability to problem solve a relatively easy situation. Moreover, many other parties were waiting for tables; and, the observable annoyance of the clientele was palpable, with several smaller parties leaving to dine elsewhere. This level of service is unacceptable for a restaurant that caters to a higher clientele.  After being seated, the service barely improved. We had to ask repeatedly for a set of silverware for one member in our party. Asked several times to receive a response, \"well, I need to find some.\" Wait, this is a restaurant, right, silverware should be available readily. After another request, we were told she would be right back. Giving credit, she did keep her word, but placed the silverware on the table saying, \"I washed these myself.\" Wait! What! We're did you wash them so quickly? Are there not codes to follow? Similar experiences were observed at other tables, with patrons having to ask repeatedly for items or not receiving their entrees.  Another surprise...when asking for lemonade, told they wet out. What! How can you be out of lemonade? Ordered appetizers and entrees. In a few minutes, waitress returned to say they no longer had tuna for the appetizers. I understand you can run out of items, but say that before. As for the quality of the food...overly salty! Not too impressive for the price paid.   Likely will not return, or will only have lunch on a slow weekday. For a weekend night out, there are many, much higher quality establishments in the Cuyahoga Falls/Akron area."}
{"text":"Aside from the bartenders and the guy that told us the specials, the servers and hostesses aren't very attentive or friendly.  We asked for outdoor seating to one hostess, the other hostess brought us to a table inside.  We asked to be moved outside and it appeared that we were a bother.  I should also add that this was our first time here for dinner.  Service was painfully slow.  I'm not sure exactly what the server did, other than take our order.  Several others delivered other items to our tables and delivered things that were missing.  Our appetizers were brought to the table and we had no silverware or napkins.  We also didn't have salt and pepper.  Two of the people at our table had fries, and no condiments were offered.  I wasn't offered anything for my hamburger.   It seemed we had to keep asking for things that should've been in place.  The server was never apologetic.  I'm not sure why everything took so long, because she seemed to have a lot of people helping her.  Everything took TOO long -- from the order taking, to the food delivery, to the clearing, and then to deliver and then collect the check.  Our entrees were brought out while we still had dirty plates/soup bowls on the table.   It seemed that our server waited to deliver all of her checks to all of her tables at once.  I saw her with a stack of checks, handing them out as she made our way to us.  I could be wrong -- but that's what it looked like -- and we waited for quite a while for OUR check.  However, the view over the river was beautiful and the food was very good.  I enjoyed the wedge salad.  My husband's steak was very tender.  Fish sandwich was enormous!  I don't recommend this place if you're in a hurry or expect to be well served.  It's not going to happen.  Oh -- And we've never just been handed our car keys when valet service has been utilized.  Given ... the car was close by -- it was just kind of weird to just be handed our car keys and directed to our car in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Family in from out of town and decided to try this out as it looks very nice and rustic. The food was awful...chicken madera was rubbery and sauce was thick glue-like. Lobster pirogies were more like ravioli except they were over cooked, one side was so crisp you needed a knife to cut thru.  Rainbow trout was so over salted it was hard to eat.  Waitress was very unprofessional, not able to  describe preparation of fish dishes. Asked how food was a few minutes after served and when one of us responded with \"chicken didn't taste right and fish too salty\" she literally shrugged her shoulders and walked away. Such a shame food so bad as buildout is nice. Floors are odd....finish makes it very slippery beware."}
{"text":"Tried this place 3 times. Wrong drink order twice. Went to pay with a gift card and it was not accepted. Credit card wasn't either. The POS was down. Fortunately I had cash. What happens if I didn 't? I suppose I'd have to find an ATM and leave my wife as collateral. No apology, just waited for the cash. The flatbead Sicilian pizza was a joke. No sausage as advertised, and the 'flat bread' was as this as a sheet of paper. Go to Merry Arts for good flatbread. The cook at this place should go there and take some lessons. Good thing it was 1/2 price night because it sure wasn't worth the 11 dollar menu price. Really not worth the 1/2 price either. The place was just about empty when I was there several times. Maybe just a few slow days and nights or maybe people are catching on to this place. There are some good menu items here and some were done well. Service is good but someone is cutting corners in the kitchen and bar service is lacking at times. Too bad, because the physical setting is good with varied seating options and a comfortable environment. It wouldn't take much for this to be a great place. But it won't take much more to for it to go away, either"}
{"text":"Ordered burntwood from uber about an hour ago. I cant say anything was great. Spin dip tasted old. The burger was supposed to have cheese and bacon but all that I got was a dried out overcooked burger with lettuce and pickles. Wouldnt recommend."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time last Saturday and clearly expectations were way too high.  Although the server was very nice and attentive - that was only after it took over 10 minutes before we were even greeted.  For a Saturday night at 7p, the restaurant was not full so we were surprised at how long it took to be noticed.   Then there was the food.. absolutely no taste and everything was charred to a crisp.  Is this related to the \"Burntwood\" name? The 2 specials, Mahi Mahi and Prime Rib were both so bland that either there was no seasoning or perhaps there was a reason they were specials.  My Prime Rib was a decent cut, but the mashed potatoes again had no taste (how do you screw up mashed potatoes?) and it was complemented by 2 skinny, charred asparagus.    Appetizer of Tavern Tots... were charred and burnt as well.   One and done for us and was so hoping this would become our new favorite restaurant, but alas, no."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Burntwood tavern and I had high expectations because others had spoke so highly of it. The food was good but the service was less than average. We were seated rather quickly. The server came to us took our drink order and was gone for about 15 minutes before she returned with them. Several people in our party ordered lemonade that needed to be sweetened but we didn't have any sugar on the table after about 10 minutes I got up and asked another server if we could have some sugar. Meanwhile a party seated next to us that had a different server who was much more interactive and helpful with dinner selections, specials etc. The server brought them bread and when the other employee we asked to bring us sugar returned we inquired about the bread for our table he informed us it wasn't on the menu but we had to ask the server for it. However being our first time at the restaurant how would we know to request this item. The food took a long time to come out so long my 7 year old fell asleep at the dinner table. I can't complain about the food though it was good! However they need to work on there servers and there interactions with customers. This visit made me definitely not want to frequent this location again. I will definitely try others though."}
{"text":"Great start that went downhill as the meal progresses. 2 out of 3 meals were tasteless. Add to it a disappearing server, very nice but not there when needed, and it's a poor showing for this place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for bad service and poor food, Burntwood Tavern is the place for you. We waited nearly an hour for our food. After the long wait, they messed up 2 of the 3 orders. The server never checked on us throughout. I would never go back."}
{"text":"To start, even after calling ahead they seated a group ahead of us that arrived after us with no reservation and when I asked about it he said they were joining another group when it was obvious it was not true.   My history with this place is what others have said, a nice view. Other than than you are lucky to get warm food."}
{"text":"Nice staff, great atmosphere. Very kind to children."}
{"text":"When I come into an establishment and I'm about to spend my hard earned money I deserve excellent service and great food. Server was friendly but spent lots of time mingling with her friends (even sat at their table and nibbled off someone's plate). She seemed more occupied of taking my order and running back over with her friends. My food was COLD, I mean like REAL COLD. WHY? I'm not impressed one bit with this place! Totally unimpressed!"}
{"text":"Service was good it's the food that seemed off here. Their soda was all flat no matter how many times the waiter brought a new glass. The food then was okay but for the price seemed to be lacking very much so. Additionally sandwiches come with fries which is nice but when the fries are coated in a thick layer of salt, it makes then unable to be eaten without ketchup. Don't think I'd be returning here anytime soon except to enjoy their patio and perhaps a few cocktails."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three more times since the \"grilled chicken salad\" incident and things seem to be back on track.  Although bad memories have kept me from ordering the chicken salad I have had the salmon salad, the California Chicken Sandwich,  and the beef sliders with the tatter tots.  All were at least 4-star good and service was good as well.     I can't wait until Spring so we can sit out on the deck overlooking the river."}
{"text":"I have been here about 10 times in the past few months. I love this location, I used to play in this when it was an abandoned mill as a kid.  Each seating area is well thought out and comfortable, the tables aren't jammed together and you don't have to listen to conversations from adjoining tables.  The best room is the bar. The patios overlooking the bar are great.  The only room I did not like is the old dining room to the south, it was hardly ever used when it was LaFevers, probably because nobody could afford LaFevers, anyhow, this room is pretty loud when it's crowded, just go for the bar if you can!  I never really cared for LaFevers, I can't recall the the name of the 2nd attempt. Nick did a great job with Samira's and I'm not sure why that went out?  Burntwood has a nice relaxed feel. You could go here for fine dinning or just to kick back at the bar with friends.  They have a Bloody Mary bar on Sunday which was very nice.  So far, everything I have tried has been incredible. The menu is not to complex and they do a great job with the presentation on everything they serve, including drinks.  Prices are incredibly reasonable and they do a happy hour from 3-6 and beyond drinks they have some appetizers on the happy hour menu.  I hope the 4th time is a charm and Burntwood sticks around for years to come because it is a class act and offers Cuyahoga Falls another great choice for any night of the week!"}
{"text":"I love the food here - never had a bad meal at any Burntwood location. The reason for this review has nothing to do with the food or service - both are outstanding. My cause for concern comes for my personal safety, if you go to this location be very careful when walking inside. The floors are so slippery that I almost wipes out 2-3 times just walking to the restroom. I felt like I was walking on ice, I'm not sure how there has never been a bad fall here before - BE CAREFUL, especially with elderly walking!"}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos are smaller, you used to get 4 now only three.  Put four back on the stone plate you sneaks.  It is hurting your reputation."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on the recommendation of someone local while working in the area. I'm glad I did. Half price appetizers during happy hour, drink specials, and great service.  The best appetizer on the menu is the pumpkin ravioli with butternut squash. It was to die for. The wings are awesome, and multiple sauces were excellent. Excellent service with a smile, quick food, and good atmosphere. I'll definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"4th time visited since they opened. I try something new each time. This visit was the Fish and chips. Great ! Large serving very tender. Previous visits, I have had the burgers and steaks. All good. Best of all they long poor on the drinks. You get your money's worth."}
{"text":"This is the fugliest restaurant in Ohio. I am leaving this review as I sit here waiting for the server to collect my payment. I legit feel embarrassed and sad that I suggested my family eat here after the wine festival. It was the first place that caught my eye. Ugh.   Food takes forever to arrive. It is cold. Water refills are not frequent. You get charged for food that is inedible. Also, the floors are very slippery, and there's a 10/  In conclusion: Do not sit with Burntwood."}
{"text":"Good service - sometimes a little too good (aka, please stop interuppting our  conversation every 2.5 minutes). And the food was good too. I give an A+ to the tavern chips with blue cheese. And an A+ for the ambiance and decor. It has a nice cozy feeling for being such a big bar. I enjoyed it. I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait. They have a crappy reservation service - they don't have a wait list (unless you are at the restaurant). Also, you can't make a reservation on Open Table either.  They need to improve upon this.  The food is not imaginative and not creative. Its pretty standard stuff."}
{"text":"My three friends and I dined at Burntwood tavern on Saturday night.  We arrived at 6.30 and were seated right away.  Restaurant was very crowded, I guess we just lucked out.  No sooner did we sit down and look at the menu, our server was over getting our drink orders.  A few minutes later, she was back explained the specials and answered our questions.  I had the tavern steak and substituted fries.  I ordered it rare, and that's how I got it!  Never know with some restaurants.  It was very good but it did come with \"salsa verde\".  I should have asked for that on the side, but that's my bad.  Friends had the peppersteak salad, tavern burger and finally a fish sandwich.  Sandwiches came with fries and were quickly devoured.    All in all everything was very good, as everyone cleaned their plates.  Service was excellent, not only did we get a check back from our server after we got our meals, the manager also stopped over and asked about our visit, which was a nice touch.  Should also point out that we got our meals in about 20 minutes, not bad for a busy Saturday night.  This was my first time at the burntwood tavern, and I'll stop back.  I'm giving 5 stars for my experience, frankly I can't remeber the last time I went out and didn't find one thing that turned me off.  This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Quick Take: Really nice bar, especially if you like beer. Lots of wonderful stuff on tap. Pseudo-rustic decor, which is okay, but I never knew how loud \"rustic\" can be. My god, sound bounces off everything in that place, so skip the intimate conversation--unless you can do it at \"11.\"   Food: I ordered a salmon BLT ($11) and a side of blistered asparagus ($4). Husband ordered Salmon Spinach Fettuccine ($16).  The food was good--not remarkable, but tasty enough. At the risk of sounding like an ugly American, the portions were skimpy--especially for the price.  No side dishes-- not even bread. Again, we're not looking for huge portions here, but rather ones that satisfy. The lack of value was reinforced when our food arrived on ginormous plates.  Overall, rather disappointing. These prices seemed more east coast than rust belt. We will go back to the bar and enjoy the great beer selection, but we will eat someplace else."}
{"text":"The wait for the average food was ridiculously long.  We waited one hour and 15 minutes at our table for two sandwiches.  Not sure I will be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent!  My business partner and I came here on a Monday night, and enjoyed an awesome meal with great service. We were served by Danielle who had a smile on her face the whole time and was a lot of fun. We would hire her to be our HR manager. You know we would! We also had a great drink from Animal, the bartender that was very inventive. And finally Kaitlyn the manager stopped by and was very helpful.  Love you all!"}
{"text":"We had a yummy dinner and great service!  We were seated immediately, drink orders taken within 5 minutes, very friendly waitstaff (thanks, Ashley), and dinner was hot and at the table 15 minutes after ordering.  Loved their soft shell crab dinner options (limited time!)."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on the weekend. Was not very busy but the restaurant is very big inside. The ambiance is very nice and warm. We started off with the zucchini frites, which were very good besides the breading falling off and it being messy. For an entree we got the soup and sandwich combo and burger which were both good. Our server Nisha was very nice but she did not know much about the menu. She did not tell us the soup of the day, fish of the day, or specials like the server told our table next to us that we over heard after we ordered. She also gave us our check mid meal when I wanted to look at the dessert menu and 99% probably would have ordered some. Overall it was a nice place, the lunch food was nothing too special, but we want to try to go there for dinner. Would be a good place to bring a group with the amount of seating there."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few time the past 6 months.  By mother-in-law moved to a new home less than .5 miles away.  I understand waiting your turn but last night a 5:35pm when we arrive it was not that busy.  Two young girls and a middle age man could not figure out the simple task of taking names as people arrive and seating them as table come up.  My wife asked 2x to add our name to the list but they were so flustered with the 12 people waiting it was a mess.    At one point I was standing in front of the desk, when someone walked in and she asked him his name and added it to the list.  I am 6 foot 3 and weigh 275 pound so I am hard to miss.  At that point I turned to my wife who was sitting on the bench to get up because we were leaving.  I said this loud enough for her to hear to see if it matter but it did not.   My internal struggle is I like to food......"}
{"text":"Go for people watching...some cocktails...an app...and beat feet ....bartenders are fantastic.....people watching is fantastic..like watching Face Off on Scyfy and a real housewives show with some heavy wallet geasers drenched in cologne.....I like the place..great looks and always something to laugh at ....it is a tavern...if you expect more join the people in Solon and pay too much for decent food...if you want eclectic food and weak drinks...try somewhere else..but an app and a quick drink or two...you got the right place"}
{"text":"Friday evening was the first and last visit for myself and my boyfriend. It started with the host attempting to seat us at a table right next to the speaker while a band was playing quite loudly. We requested another table, so we were then seated at a high table near the bar. It was so dark that we had to use the flashlight on our cell to read the menu, as well as it was still so loud that we could not hear one another trying to converse at the small table.  Our server made us feel as if she was annoyed by our presence and was not very attentive. In fact, she was blatantly rude. We would have said something to the manager, but he was also not attentive. He did not ask how everything was, nor did he offer to clear our plates as he passed our table several times, so we will call corporate to file a complaint instead.   I wish I could say that the food made up for the lack of service, but it did not. It was not bad, but it wasn't great. Certainly not worth returning."}
{"text":"3 to 5 pm happy hour half price appetizers and flatbreads! !!hreat deal...love the spinach artichoke dip...and flat breads esp the margarita flatbreads! !! Sirena our usual waitress is the best!!! Ask for her!!!"}
{"text":"Price - Somewhat on the high side Food Quality - Average. I had the Tavern Dip. Just so-so.  Service - Weak. I had to go to extremes to get some attention from our server.  Ambiance - New construction. Still popular since it's be. Loud. Tough to hear because of wooden floors and walls. Nice outdoor patio, but overlooks parking lot."}
{"text":"Great service and the crab cakes were excellent. I would recommend going and enjoy the views and the food."}
{"text":"I was skeptical because they only had 3.5 stars on Yelp, but you have steered me wrong on this one Yelp!  Delicious food, gorgeous ambiance, and reasonable prices. Whhaaat.  The restaurant has a very elegant and relaxed feel to it. There's outdoor seating also, as they're along the river.  I ordered the Mixed Berry salad, which, as one of the cheaper meals on menu at just $13 for dinner, came with not only the mixed berries of its name but also cedar plank salmon! You're kidding! And spinach and feta, of course. It was so good.  My co-diners got a couple of different burgers and also loved them. Their house fries are yum too; they sprinkle some sort of cajun-esque seasoning on them.  And of course, I got a side of sweet potato fries because I always do when a place offers them. Can't go wrong with sweet potato fries.  Dessert was amazing too. They have the single-serving portions of desserts in those cute little cups some places use. So happy about that. I got the creme brulee and I don't regret it. Another co-diner got some sort of double- or triple-chocolate thing. I think he was quite happy.  The service was also impeccable. Both the hostess and our server were pleasant and helpful. The only weird thing was the \"free valet.\" Maybe on nights when they're busier, the valet has to double-park people? We went on a Sunday evening, and there was plenty of room in the lot and it was maybe a 10 or 15 second walk from one end of the lot to the front door. The valet was very insistent, but he was no match for my mother-in-law.  But we forgot about him soon enough with all the delicious food :) Don't be shy! I am so looking forward to trying their brunch!"}
{"text":"We took my parents to this location on Father's Day (their first trip to burntwood) and the only reason I'm giving it 1 star is because they sat us right away. They only had a few tables full and half the restaurant was empty. The waitress took awhile to grab our drinks in the beginning, but was very nice. Then we ordered our food and it took an hour for it to come out. Our waitress apologized twice but couldn't give a reason why it was taking so long. When we got our food my moms grilled chicken was cold and my pork chop was mostly charred. And Nothing was done for the inconvenience of having to wait so long to get our food. I will never eat at this location again. They have been open over a year and none of the other locations are this slow. Our friends were sitting at another table and they said exactly the same thing."}
{"text":"Burntwood was a great addition to Cuyahoga Falls as we have nothing like it. It has an excellent brunch menu - I highly recommend trying the Bloody Mary cart. Their happy hour offers excellent prices on drinks and appetizers that are filling enough to make up meals. They have very unique and delicious seasonal menu items as well as awesome smoked prime rib options. Definitely my favorite restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"I was there kind of late. so it seemed like theybwanted to go home. id give it another try"}
{"text":"Appallingly bad service. A hummingbird would hang at a table longer than this crew. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Dec. 29 2010 Today we had a friend in from NYC, and chose Burntwood tavern for a leisurely lunch. Now this decision did not come without pressure,because our guest is a personal chef for more than a few celebrities. What a completely wonderful afternoon! The service was great..., The menu seemed to highlight \"favorites\" with a contemporary twist. The presentation was casual yet impressive. We each loved our choices and will certainly be back. Thank you Burntwood!!"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviews about the decor & bar.  Very nice.  The food and service are just average.  Nice beer selection and happy hour is good.  All in all, nothing special, but not that bad."}
{"text":"We live in solon and this place is very close by and easy to get to.  We've tried it 3 times and won't try it a fourth.  I am literally dumbfounded by the popularity of this place.  Don't try to get in there on a Friday or Saturday night, you'll wait a very long time.  It's mostly run of the mill stuff with fancy offerings thrown in and none of what I've tried is particularly interesting, or good for that matter.  I would personally recommend trying a different restaurant if you're looking for something with a few unique offerings.  One thing I will give them credit for - they have survived for a fairly long time in a location that has had a lot of turnover."}
{"text":"Like most of the reviewers I have the same issue with the level of service at the Solon location. On a recent visit I sat down at the bar after asking the server if the seat was available. I would think that she would then ask if I would like anything to drink. I sat there for 12 minutes with no less than 5 bartenders walking past and doing everything but serving customers---washing glasses, filling orders for the dining room, tapping on the computer screen, etc.  Once we got our drinks it did not get much better from there.  It took another 15 minutes or so for someone to come to take our order.  The food is OK, nothing fantastic.  And the prices are a bit steep, which I don't mind paying if the service was better.  I also wouldn't mind paying higher prices if there weren't little kids running around like maniacs and screaming, which I know is not under the control of the restaurant but takes away from the whole experience.  There are better choices in the Solon/Bainbridge area."}
{"text":"I had the worst restaurant experience of my entire life on Mother's Day.  My husband and I took my parents there for brunch and arrived at noon.  It took over an hour to get our food and when we did, only two out of the four people got theirs.  My mom ordered a chicken salad that made a Wendy's salad look amazing.  WIth only a few black beans, tons of iceberg lettuce and the wrong dressing.  My dad ordered an eggs benedict with salmon that was cold.  When my husband got his with prime rib,  he said the meat smelled bad and didn't seem cooked.  I got the belgian waffle with fruit and the fruit was still frozen!  The serve took no responsibility for any of it and blamed the kitchen.  We asked one of the servers a question and he shrugged his shoulders and said it was his first day.  He never once offered to find out the answer.  It was the worst service I have ever seen.  The manager did apologize and comp our bill but the damage was done.  Our Mother's Day brunch was ruined and we wasted two hours eating terrible food.  Save yourself the time and money and avoid this place at all costs.  It was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been to Burntwood several times over the years and it has continually gone down hill. The last time was last Saturday mid afternoon. It was quiet and slow. My friend and I ordered salads and it took 15 minutes to arrive and then without the gorgonzola. Another 10 minutes to get that. Dessert also took 20 minutes and came only after we flagged down the manager to ask where it was. He was nice enough to remove it from our bill, which was great because it was not good.  The servers used to be more caring and professional. The hostess looked like someone out of a cartoon with torn-look stockings, skintight clothes and a rhinestone headband. I think their standards have gone way down."}
{"text":"Favorite place in Solon. Beautiful outdoor patio. Sunday brunch menu is spectacular. Going tomorrow for 14 year olds birthday, his request and he is an especially picky eater. A must try."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with a total of 4 people. There was about a 40 minute wait so I would definitely recommend making a reservation on the weekends.   The tavern itself is very nice on the inside. No access to the patio it being winter. Tables are very very close to each other. I felt like I was basically at the table next to us.   Food was decently priced, maybe a tad on the high side. Burgers around $12 and main entrees are around $18 and up. Apps around $10 depending on what you get. The quality of the food was excellent! My burger was perfectly cooked and our spinach and artichoke dip was amazing. Our server was courteous, had all the food out quickly.  The only reason I gave 4 stars was the seating and it was pretty loud on the inside (I guess to be expected). I would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Went to the Solon location for lunch today.   I think Shakespeare said it best.  Much Ado About Nothing.  Food was average.   Service was slow.  They asked if we had reservations.   Really?   For lunch?   In Solon?   LMAO"}
{"text":"Waited way too long for my entree and it was very undercooked. Not impressed at all with this location.  The service was good, the server was polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Overpriced,average food,below average staff. Go to Cork and Bottle,Rockne's,Stevensons,Kristys,Trader Jacks,or the Colony instead.All are a much better experience both for food and cash value."}
{"text":"Another of our regulars disappoints.  On the first enjoyable patio day, we were pleased to get outside seating after a previous bad experience only moments before,  While waiting for someone to at least give us some water, my hubby shored up the rickety table, and we waited some more.  Then some more.  No water, no apps, no drink order taken.  And somehow, others seated after us got served with all these things.  Not patronizing a restaurant on the decline, especially with a new place popping up in this area all the time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch after shopping. The staff was incredibly nice and accommodating.  The food was fine. I had a burger and it was average I guess, a bit disappointing. The fries it came with were delicious, but there weren't that many. Probably wouldn't go back with the other options around. Also, the floor is oddly waxy and walking to the bathroom was quite a weird/uncomfortable experience."}
{"text":"My son had the Burntwood Tavern Burger,  he said it was fantastic and cooked the way he asked.  They even remembered no tomato.   I had the Tavern Dip with prime rib and sweet  potatoes fries,  also very good.  Nice atmosphere and our server Jayme was super nice.  We will definitely be back.  So much better than Cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"Not bad, but I feel it was a bit over-hyped and overpriced.   The French fries were very good. My \"Old River\" burger was sort of a kitchen-sink of burgers, topping a (decent-but-nothing-special) burger patty with cheese (which I omitted), pulled pork, bacon, cole slaw, barbecue sauce, onions, and pickles. All those toppings pretty much overwhelm the burger. It's nothing you couldn't get or assemble anywhere else, tasty in that artery-clogging tailgate food sort of way. At $7 -- and they added sales tax to that -- the Great Lakes draft beer (a 14-ounce \"pint\"?) was no bargain, either.   Our service was very good, but with tax and tip, burger, fries, and beer came to $25. I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Not a very good place to go if you are in a wheelchair, trying to get in the restaurant is a challenge, once inside we were shown to a table with four chairs and the waiter walked away leaving us to move the furniture around so we could get the wheelchair to the table. When the waiter arrived back to take our order we requested the Artichoke dip as an appetizer, about four minutes past when the waiter informed us the dip was not available as they did not have the ingredients. We then ordered the egg plant straws which was kind of a mistake as they where only half cooked oily and stodgy. For our main meal I ordered the Chicken Marsala, which the menu described as served with crispy potatoes, blistered asparagus and mushrooms in a Marsala sauce, the crispy potatoes were far from crispy and were well overcooked, the Asparagus was so hard it could not be consumed and there was no mushrooms. The Marsala sauce tasted like just a brown gravy poured over two pieces of what tasted like chicken. My companion ordered the pork chop with sweet potato fries. The pork was not cooked near the large bone and overcooked in other places which made it tough, and it was covered in some kind of brown liquid, could not tell what it was, the Sweet Potato fries served in a paper container should have been left in the kitchen. And now the good news the Desert, The maple bread pudding with ice creme was to die for. This was our first visit to this restaurant and i don't think we will return.  Visited December 2016"}
{"text":"Top notch! Great drinks, service, atmosphere,  and the food! Oh so good! Happy hour specials are great too.  I recommend the tuna nachos or the shrimp tacos..."}
{"text":"If I could give this 3.5 stars I would.  Our party of 12 went last weekend for a friend's birthday and had a reservation for 8 pm.  We arrived on time but they weren't able to seat us until 8:30, kind of annoying but no big deal.  To our delight and surprise upon our seating we were presented with three apps and a glass of champagne each to compensate for our wait.  A very nice gesture, and much appreciated!  They gave us the Hummus, Calamari, and Artichoke, Roasted Garlic and Tasso Fondue.  All were great, but the perfectly seasoned and very tender Calamari especially stood out to me.    I ordered the Asiago Crusted Chicken for dinner, and while it wasn't incredibly original it was delicious.  I wrapped up half and ate the leftovers as soon as I got home later that night.  The friend to my right ordered the house salad, which I tried and quite liked, although next time I would get the dressing on the side.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy their food and the service was fantastic.    We used to go to the Pub every Monday for trivia and were pretty bummed when it closed.  I love what Burntwood has done with the interior of the restaurant, and while I'll still miss trivia, the food is an upgrade as well.  Definitely worth a trip back."}
{"text":"Very good food tonight. The service was outstanding!! The pork tenderloin dish was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Well. I like to engage the help in conversation occasionally and I asked our driver Malcolm (God Bless him, he's Ukrainian or something) where Lovey and I might eat out on a blustery winter night. He suggested The Burntwood Tavern in Brecksville.  I read some reviews and although it was a good suggestion, rolled my eyes at Malcolm and bid him away.   Malcolm had the Flying Spur warmed for us and we headed out into the snowy traffic but I was a bit concerned when we got near Brecksville. I had been assured that this was an enclave of inherited wealth but such was not evident from my vantage point in the backseat. Here was tacky candy shop, there was a 'Chinese' restaurant and we even saw a \"car wash\" near a \"gas station.\" Lovey stared straight ahead. Ah Ha, I thought pointedly, we're slumming tonight.  After a bit of confusion and threat of cultural confrontation with the Ukrainian valet (God love Malcolm; he is rather possessive of the Bentley) we went inside. Clean. Decorative. Spacious. We were seated upstairs at a table near others. Our server was a delightful young man, well-dressed and attentive. I had been forewarned that he might not be attired in a suitably demeaning and uniform way but he was in fact wearing the same as the other people shuffling to and fro who were employees.  I ordered a vodka gimlet with a splash of Cointreau. A glass of Pinot Noir for Lovey. They arrived promptly and although served in \"glassware\" as opposed to fine crystal, the effect worked with the general motif of dining near and actually amongst people who worked for a living. We ordered the kind of food one might suspect is ordered in a tavern; a meat sandwich for myself and a \"grilled\" piece of fish for dearest. Both arrived promptly and tasted salty and earthy like the fare one might find at a themed fundraiser. It was fun to eat it and was both satisfying and warm to the touch.  As this is my first review, I might be inclined to give the restaurant as many stars as possible because it was safe and enjoyable but I must comment on the people both in the bar and at the tables around us. I wished I had thought to have Malcolm take a few photos so you could judge these people with me. Margaret Mitchell would have; were she still alive of course as dead people do not take photos. I digress.    These people looked like, I dare say it, commoners. They talked about things like their jobs and their children. One group at a nearby table was laughing and enjoying a woman's droll tale about college. A booth by the wall contained a bubbly woman paired with a fussy 'working' man replete with gritty fingernails and a permanent sneer. This man scowled the whole night as he craned his neck to see the other patrons. He would take a bite of his salmon and then lean in toward the woman and say something he clearly thought was clever. She feigned interest.  I needed to get out. Still, Lovey seemed a tad cheerful and feisty on the ride home. She had heard about \"Richfield\" and now she could say she had eaten just down the road. How exciting for her!  So, the food is good and the waiters dress correctly and the alcohol is a must but if you go, be prepared to be distracted by the distractions around you.  \"It is a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money.\" -Albert Camus"}
{"text":"The food was very good but the service wasn't. Our server was reasonably pleasant, but she just didn't come around very often. Our food arrived about two minutes after our salads (brought by a runner, not our server), which is a huge pet peeve of my wife and me. The runner told us she could put the food under the heat lamp if we wanted (we declined, because we weren't at McDonald's). She said she would inform the manager of our dissatisfaction with the timing. If she did, he didn't care, because he never came by.  I had the Buntwood Burger, which was very good--excellent if served right from the kitchen, and my wife had the salmon, which she liked very much. She decided to eat her entree when it came and revisited her salad later on. I probably should have done the same, because my burger was quite cold by the time I could eat it, and the egg yolk pooled under the bun and made it very soggy and messy. I guess I'm a traditionalist, though, and want to finish my salad first.  It is likely we will return to the Burntwood again in due time, as the atmosphere is pleasing and the food was good. There were plenty of other options on the menu to try next time. I just hope our service is better when we decide to try again."}
{"text":"went to the new one in brecksville for lunch. ambiance/decor was great but sandwich was not good.  the soup was awesome but I could get that at zoup. no one in my party liked thier food so if u go, just get drinks and people watch."}
{"text":"I think the food is too expensive for what it is. The atmosphere is nice and the patio is decked out. I'm upset with how much salt they use too."}
{"text":"We visited Burntwood Tavern as a party of 4 on a busy hot summer Friday evening.  The hostess was very rude to the party ahead of us and told them sharply to \"just wait a minute!\"    The inside was busy and smelled funny, sort of like a vinegar smell.  Maybe this is the wood along with the high humidity?  Anyway, we opted to sit outside.  The wait was about 30 min but we didn't mind the outside so we were seated on the patio.    The waiter was very nice and helpful.  He made some recommendations on drinks and dishes.  My husband, unfortunately did not agree with the recommendation of the pork chop with the peach sauce.  It was extremely overcooked, dry and tasted strongly of canned peaches.  I had the chicken dish and it was almost overcooked, the Parmesan cheese breading was extremely over baked but it was still tasty.   Our friends ordered the halibut and the cedar planked salmon over gazpacho.  The fish dishes were far better than mine and the gazpacho was delicious.    The drinks were good and the calamari appetizer was also enjoyable.  For the price it was not that great of a place and I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"We were in Solon for a wedding and came upon this great place! Happy hour EVERY DAY from 3:00-6:00! Appetizers half price, the calamari was outrageous! Draught beers-great selections, a locally made wheat from Chagrin Falls was a big hit. Our waiter was the sweetest ever, spent extra time chatting with us. After an 8 hr drive from New Jersey, this was an awesome place to wind down with a few drinks and appetizers. Don't pass this place up if you're on the area!"}
{"text":"Oh Oh Oh...this was a wonderful experience. The place is comfortable. The food was excellent. The service was pleasant as could be! My friend had steak and I had the pecan encrusted tilapia with root vegetables. Excellent! Also, shared a Margarita pizza that was to die for... and between the hours of 3 to 6 the appetizers were half price and specialty drinks were discounted. I had this most refreshing pear vodka infused cucumber drink that was perfect. Okay, maybe two of them!  Would go back in a heartbeat. In fact, when my friend visits from out of town soon, we are already planning a visit."}
{"text":"Just very average food. Been there at least 5 times with same opinion.The outside server got very defensive when I asked him if he had #10 Tangueray gin. He thought that I did not knew if he had not heard of it or not - too much drama! We changed tables. Hard to find good help-even in this Econ/environment. Should have left from the start."}
{"text":"Easter brunch was amazing. Nice atmosphere. Super selection of food. The pastries were fantastic and were obviously freshly baked. We thought it was reasonably priced for the selection, especially compared to some of the other brunches that day.  Only complaint was that we were charged for juice and coffee and the waitress did not make that clear before we ordered.  $5.00 for 2 glasses of juice is a bit much even on a holiday."}
{"text":"This was our first time going to burnt but had heard many good things. We made a reservation 2 days ago and we're seated right way. They have a very simple single page menu but with plenty of good food to pick from. I had the Old River burger and my girlfriend had the fish and chips we both very much enjoyed our meals.   On top of great tasting food the service was the best I have experienced in a very long time. Waitstaff was fast and attentive.   All said and done very fair prices and great atmosphere. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love Burntwood! Their food is absolutely amazing and they always have the nicest staff. We usually end up chatting with our server/bartender and they always turn out to be great people and make the whole experience that much better.   The calamari is unbelievable and I can easily polish off the flatbread pizza by myself - it's that good. I've never gotten anything from here that I haven't loved. It just makes ordering so difficult!"}
{"text":"Tater tots were amazing and I'll  defintly order the shrimp tacos again. Our server was friendly and efficient. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Beautiful location.  Terrible service.  Food is fine at best.  Watched my server complain about me after receiving a disgusting cold and soggy sandwich that was not described accurately in the menu at all.  Honestly such a waste.  I've been here multiple times and every time there is an issue and I'm not even that picky or confrontational.  I work at a restaurant like it's not that hard."}
{"text":"We've loved Burnt Wood from the time the only location was in Chagrin. Since expanding, the menu has changed and the service along with it. We just tried the Lyndhurst location and were sad to see that other reviews were spot on. While gorgeous in design, the food was less than stellar. Our salads were limp and warm-mine missing the bacon altogether. They were very accommodating, as always, making my sandwich a wrap, but the tots were burned and loaded with salt. Another review stated that it's gone from chef to cook and that sums it up. The bones are still there-a solid menu and gorgeous atmosphere, but I want the care and service we came to love when Burnt Wood first opened. We don't want to give up on you Burnt Wood, but please go back to what made you so great in the beginning."}
{"text":"We had out-of-state guests visiting and wanted to take them somewhere special. After spending some time in downtown Chagrin Falls, checking out the falls, the Sunday Farmer's Market and a stop to the historic hardware store, we headed to the Burntwood Tavern for brunch.   The ambiance gives you a very homey, welcoming feeling from the couches and arm chairs in the lobby to the wood that dominates the floors and walls, much of it repurposed barnwood beams and planking.   I've visited this location a number of times but had not been there for brunch yet. Although everyone else at the table ordered from the regular menu, I ordered the Smoked Shaved Prime Rib Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise Sauce and Hash Browns ($11) from the brunch menu. It was very good. The eggs were done just right - and I'm picky about the way I like mine (soft on the inside, but not too runny) and the hash browns were nice and golden brown.   Other items ordered by my friends were the Tavern Ruben (on thin rye, almost like a flat bread $10), Veggie Burger (black bean $9), and a couple got the Certified Angus Burger ($10). All of the sandwiches come with fries served in a cut-off brown paper bag. There weren't any leftovers, so it's safe to say everyone enjoyed their meals too.  The service was OK - I've had better service on my other visits. It wasn't poor enough to not return. I surely will return as this is one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Went there around 6pm on a Monday. The place seemed busy but not packed. Took us a bit of time to get waited on. Waiter took our drink order. They were out of Blue Moon on draft. My brother in law asked for a specific drink (even gave directions) and it came back wrong twice. My husband ordered Captain Morgan's which was loaded with ice. They were out of the special (meatloaf, seriously?). The waiter disappeared after we got our drinks, and returned about 20 minutes later to take our food order. The guys got filets, which they said were very good, and I got a chicken dish which was fair. Dessert was good. The manager cut us a break on the drinks; the bill for 3 was $130, pretty pricey. It's an attractive restaurant in a good location, but they need to get their act together to be considered a contender."}
{"text":"staff wasn't too friendly or attentive but the food is amazing (Asiago chicken is delicious!)and the walk along the river after was even more nice!!"}
{"text":"I USED to love this place until I just had my birthday here. I was so disappointed with management and our server was so rude and unhappy the whole time. She looked at me and said \"what\" in a rude tone when I needed something. She didn't bag up the rest of our platters - she didn't even ask if we wanted them bagged. Just threw them away and at 25$ a pop we would have liked to take them home. Our waitress made my guests wait forever for their drinks and to order food which, as a server myself, infuriates me. I am upset with management because he was impossible to get ahold of and didn't even try to call us back to book this party. When we got ahold of him FINALLY days later and he said that we would be charged $30 a person for a 3 course meal which we didn't want. We worked it out and got platters instead. Then we wanted to be on the patio which he agreed to. The weather wasn't great so it was closed but he didn't even let us know that we would be in a different part of the restaurant. Overall, the experience sucked. DO NOT BOOK YOUR PARTY HERE."}
{"text":"Never have had a bad meal here! Plus they carry a bunch of great beers on tap. Always great customer service. Love it!"}
{"text":"We showed up during happy hour and te place was packed but they bent over backwards to seat us. The service was excellent-out waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and fast. The appetizers were excellent, especially the lobster pierogi and seared tuna nachos. Our entrees were also great  loved the prime beef dip. Overall great place!"}
{"text":"I went for happy hour on a Saturday afternoon. They have a nice sitting area outside that's covered. I also saw some heat lamps so maybe it's open during the winter too. We got some beers and a chicken quesadilla. It was a nice place to relax during the afternoon. Also free valet."}
{"text":"Your restaurant is half full, plenty of staff walking around doing nothing but make your customers wait 5 minutes for a table? Then servers walk past you and ignore you? The only thing this place has going for them is the view."}
{"text":"Swing and a miss! I recently got food to go, and my experience was awful! First off I had to fight my way to the bar to wait for someone to help me. Then when they asked after me, my burger was prepared wrong, and they told me that's how it was ordered! Instead of apologizing they accused me of ordering it wrong. I was standing next to my wife when she ordered our food and know exactly what she said! The bartender offered to have a new burger cooked for me but the place was so busy I didn't really want to stand there another 20 minutes. So I paid full price and the head bartender offered me a \"quick shot of whiskey\"! To which I replied \"no\"! Needless to say Burntwood Tavern has to do something about their carryout service. This wasn't the first time I had a bad experience. The wings were over cooked, the French fries were cold, the salad was warm, and obviously the Burger was overdone and room temperature! To sum up they need to improve their carryout service!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is good however, the Moscow Mule recipe has changed. We started to go with the Martini's..."}
{"text":"I had a great time! Food was good. Service was good. Drinks were great. Loved the smell of the real wood burning on the fire.   We made it in right before happy hour ended and got two quick rounds of drinks. I had a Moscow mule that was great (and in a copper mug! What a hipster I must be?) and a mojito. Both were very good. The second drink the ladies got was a bit strong but a highball of cranberry juice solved that.    We had their tater tots for a started and they were amazing. Loved the dipping sauce.   I had the burntwood burger as my main. Very good. Subbed the roasted veggies for the fries as I already had potatoes. They were probably the best roasted veggies I've had at a restaurant before.   The only complaint I could possibly level would be that our desserts took a bit long to arrive, but whatever. Not a big deal."}
{"text":"Place is beautiful and great atmosphere.   Can't say the same for the food. Went there for brunch and was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. We loved the rustic but classy atmosphere and the view of the river.  We both had salmon salads and I asked for my salmon to be cooked well done and it was PERFECT.  Pretzel bread is wonderful and addicting. Friendly staff.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great place, an instant neighborhood cornerstone."}
{"text":"The food was excellent as well as the service! Parking could be an issue but they have valet! I was a little hesitant to bring the kids but when I walked in the staff made us feel so welcome! Great place!"}
{"text":"Frozen pretzel sticks served frozen. Dry calamari. Hour wait. Go here if you don't know where to find good food because at least you might not get food poisoning. Please rename Burntfood tavern. Fish and chips was frozen. Inedible slaw. There was hair in my burnt steak. I could probably play basketball with the potatoes. The servers are nice. Fix your management problem. On a scale of one to ten it's a :("}
{"text":"Would have given zero stars if possible! Was there last night with friends. There was no valet parking and had to drive around trying to find a spot. The server, Asian looking gal was super rude. It took a while for the entree to arrive and the explanation was ridiculous- \"there is a big party who need to be served first\"- really?? How does that pertain to us? Wanted to tip ZERO- but did not! Now regret for tipping for rude service! Pricey place with below average food and poor service!!"}
{"text":"There on a Sunday evening.  Not busy, but service was terrible.  Took forever to get food, and then 2 of our party didn't get served until everyone else was essentially finished.  Inexcusable.  Food was so so.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"My family had a wonderful time celebrating a birthday. Our waitress even brought us complementary champagne for a toast. The half price appetizer deal is awesome, especially for a large group."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! I highly recommend the Ahi Tuna Nachos. I also liked the Asiago Crusted Chicken Sandwich. Everything on the menu is a pretty good value. The service can be pretty slow when they're busy."}
{"text":"Chelsea was amazing. We had tator tots and they were great. Our server was very attentive and we had a great experience. Ask for Chelsea. Seriously. Do it."}
{"text":"The service is fantastic.  The food is fantastic.  The environment is fantastic.  The drinks are fantastic.    I wasn't sure what to expect and am pleasantly surprised by the all encompassing quality of this restaurant.  The cost is worth it.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Great food.. Wish you got more for your money but none the less good. Our server was awesome super friendly and seemed well educated on the draft list! Order the house IPA smelled as it tasted .. Great!"}
{"text":"The happy hour is stellar.  Specifically, the Red Cabernet, Tater Tots, and Beef Sliders.  The cabernet delivers a nice taste and buzz, and the tater tots are home made and Humongous.  The tots also come with 3 different sauces: Spicy, Ranch,and BBQ.  Needless to say, it's redonkulous.  Great spot for a date, party, or happy hour after work.  It ends at 6:00 p.m. - but this also applies to ANY TABLE or the Bar!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the happy hour specials. The drinks did the job. The wait staff was pretty good. We ordered some happy hour food specials. The fish tacos tasted good, but the tuna nachos gave us food poisoning. Not pleased about that. I have other family that used to attend on a regular (weekly) basis, but they became tired of the same old menu, beer selection and coming to a trendy local place that isn't really all that great compared to some other bar/restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Great looking place. Bad service. Our waiter horrible. Took 15 minutes to get drinks and about 15 additional minutes to get my husbands dinner salad. Food tasted great but a little pricier than it should be"}
{"text":"I think this is a really attractive restaurant, with comfortable seating and a pleasant atmosphere.  We have eaten here twice and enjoyed it as a place to socialize with friends.  No complaints about the staff either. Our waitress was friendly and capable.  I can't remember what we ordered on our first visit, but I believe we did several appetizers as our meal and thought they were good.  Today, though, two of us had the Angus burger and we both agreed that it tasted more like a somewhat soggy burger king whopper than a burger worthy of a nice restaurant.  The meat was thick and juicy, though not very well seasoned. The bigger problem was the sesame seed bun which was thin and grocery store generic.  The tomato was mushy and with the meat juices, by the time we added a little mustard, the whole thing was a bit of a wet mess. This burger definitely needs a better bun with good texture, like a pretzel bun to keep it all together. We will not be ordering these again.  My husband was also somewhat unimpressed with the flavor of his steak and eggs brunch (a bit too salty and charred for his taste), though he thought it was really well presented. He said he will try something else next time as well.  The potato sides were OK. My husband had hash browns, I had the \"tater tots\" and our friend had the sweet potato fries, the last two being a small upcharge on the standard fries.  We thought the sweet potato fries were the best of the three.  The fries and tots came in a cut down paper bag which was cute.  The burger and fries were $10 each, before upcharge which seemed reasonable, pricewise - that is, if the burger had been better. One other small downside was the berry iced tea,  which does not come with refills.  We were only told that after we drank the first glass.  This is the first restaurant I have been in that did not give refills on flavored iced tea. Strange, considering how much profit is usually built into drinks. They did, however, offer us free refills of plain iced tea instead, which kept us from going thirsty.  Our three meals and three drinks came to around $45 - $54 with tip.  I think we will eat here again for the atmosphere and view, just not for the burgers. Oh, one more thing, on busy nights it is impossible to get a parking space anywhere near the place unless you valet.  Otherwise, the closest deck can be pretty scarey-desolate at night."}
{"text":"The expanded menu has elevated this establishment to a 4--star level that now equals the 4-star decor and coziness. Delicious food in a warm and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I took family, visiting from NY, to Burntwood Tavern, knowing they had several gluten-free items on the menu.  My sister-in-law, who has Celiac disease, asked our server, Alexa, about an appetizer. Alexa offered to get a gluten free menu for her, but also offered several options. She knew every item on the menu and which were, or could be, made gluten free.  She was friendly, knowledgeable, and a very attentive server.  We had a wonderful evening, thanks to Alexa."}
{"text":"The last couple times we've been to the Burntwood it has been less then impressive. Thought we'd give it another try tonight.  Brought 3 clients in for dinner.  A Monday night without a full house.  Three entrees were no longer available - didn't mention it until we tried to order.  Terrible service!  Rude food delivery.  Flies all over the restaurant - I was swatting throughout my meal. Never offered dessert so I asked about dessert when he brought the bill.  Ordered all the desserts which took forever!!  Never offered additional drinks or a coffee.  Spent $350+ for some of the shittiest service I've ever had.  I was embarrassed and will never take clients again."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch recently and the food was pretty bad... I ordered Smoked Salmon Benedict and it was awful.  First of all, the english muffins at the base of the dish were not even toasted.  The were maybe microwaved at some point which made them soggy and chewy.  The salmon was not smoked salmon as described but rather some bland poached salmon. When the dish arrived it was ice cold and the hollandaise sauce was congealed. The potatoes that accompanied the dish were greasy and the fruit consisted of a few berries that I suspect were not fresh but rather frozen and then thawed.  My husband ordered a breakfast burrito and it was also not very good. It was dried out and also arrived cold.  It was not served with any kind of condiments (i.e salsa, guac, sour cream) and when he inquired about getting some salsa or pico, they said they didn't have any (which I found hard to believe.)  Another person at our table was brought his dish without the accompanying potatoes because they said they had run out of them and explained they would bring them out to him shortly.  They finally brought them out to him as we were getting our bill and they were cold and greasy.    I rarely write YELP reviews but I want to save others from making the mistake of thinking they are going to get a delicious brunch...because they are NOT."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a bite to eat after shopping and loved this place! The food and drinks were excellent. I ordered two cocktails and had the margarita flatbread. The presentation was great and the service was fast. My bartender was Nina and she was very helpful with my selection. She also kept good conversation and awareness to my needs. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"If it doesn't taste great at least try and make it look appealing. Ordered a \"Two For\" - half sandwich plus Caesar salad - what came was a bare half sandwich next to a small clump of wilted lettuce! A nice place to go if you have exhausted all other options."}
{"text":"I love Burntwood Tavern! The atmosphere is great in every season. The log cabin feel is great in the winter and the outdoor area next to the river is great during the warmer months. I typically only come during happy hour, because the appetizers and drinks are so good for a great price. The tater tots are amazing and come with three different dipping sauces. These are not your average tater tots! They are more like a ball of delicious fried mashed potatoes. So good. The shrimp tacos, flatbreads and calamari are all awesome too. I went for brunch once and the breakfast burritos were average tasting and pretty small. The salmon eggs Benedict dish was pretty good!"}
{"text":"We will not go back there. Although we specifically asked, the meat and fish cooked only slightly. Everything was very well done and very dry. Even though I wanted to reduce calories. There was a ball of butter on the meat. We received new dishes as we pleased. And this time loaded with black pepper ... The dessert was also very low. The coffee was of course mediocre. It took time and the children were already very hungry and crying . When we received the bill we received no compensation for the aggravation. No dessert No coffee ... Too bad ..."}
{"text":"Been here three times. Always unimpressed with the staff and service, though it's only been especially horrible on two of my visits. Food is ok at best, but generally regrettable.  I had a decent burger once. Last time I had a steak that I couldn't taste because of the garlic butter slopped on top of it. I've enjoyed similar presentations at other restaurants, but this one left me feeling like I had eaten a clove of raw garlic for most of the evening. I would also opt for fries over the \"tater-tots\", which I was excited to try but tasted like badly-seasoned, room temperature balls of starch with a tough outer coating.  Service wise, I've had a server who smelled of alcohol, was too casual (to the point of disrespect) with conversation, and generally obnoxious.  Another time I ordered an old fashioned, only to have my server return ten minutes later to tell me the bartender is \"an idiot\", doesn't know how to make it, and was currently on medication. Five minutes after that he returned again to tell me they didn't have bitters and couldn't make the drink. I ordered something else and when the server finally brought it to the table there was a fruit fly floating in the glass.  I would absolutely never return to the Burntwood Tavern my own volition - especially with several better options in the center of town. The place is usually busy and I still can't figure out why. Maybe Brecksville residents just don't want to see yet another restaurant in this building fail, as it's been home to many short-lived ventures in recent years."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour - especially when you can sit outside and enjoy the patio.  The food is consistently good every time I've been there."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say!! The decor is great and food even better. Angus Sliders for an appetizer were great. My cedar salmon was the best piece of fish I have had in a long time! Wife had Salmon Spinach Fettuccini and really enjoyed! This is easily our new favorite spot in Chagrin hands down!! Great Beer & wine selection also!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this location! Went for brunch and evertthing was spectacular! Amazing bloody mary bar Also love to head up for a happening happy hour! Service is always responsive and I love the menu. Especially love their salads!"}
{"text":"Good location overlooking the river. I really like the ambiance, the food I think was OK not very special. Service was good. We really enjoyed their Calamari ! We took California Grilled chicken and Asiago crusted chicken, both were a bit bland, I liked  Asiago crusted chicken it was a bit sweet. Desserts looked delicious. I would go back but probably not take the same dish again."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now, have eaten twice.  I had a burger which was pretty good.  Nothing extraordinary but seemed like it was made fresh, not a frozen patty.  Had a grilled chicken salad with apple, goat cheese, and walnuts last time.  That was really good.  Chicken had just the right amount of black on it.  Drinks are good, but sometimes inconsistent.  The Tennessee tea has been everything from strong and delicious to a syrupy mess.  Also, please learn how to spell Tennessee for your menu, and Manhattan for your online menu.  The tavern Manhattan was really good, as was the Daily Barry.  Service at the bar is usually awesome.  At the table, it was a bit delayed.  They were busy, but the server forgot my drink once, and everything seemed to take a while.  I would recommend sitting at the bar, and coming when it's not so busy.  I feel like with some consistency in recipes and a few changes, this place could be awesome."}
{"text":"Why do people love mediocre food so much? The restaurant itself was nice but the food was very \"meh.\""}
{"text":"We are never disappointed by the Burntwood.  Great food, great drinks, great service, great scene.  I applaud your consistency."}
{"text":"I've never been blown away by the Burntwood's food, and last night's visit confirmed my feeling.  Odd sandwich, runny/undercooked creme brulee, so-so everything else.  If it wasn't for the cool atmosphere and decor, this place wouldn't be any better than Applebee's.  Wait - it isn't!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Definitely swap out fresh cut fries on the tavern chips. Drinks were standard. Service was fine until... (Says in a whisper) People don't forget, Stuart!"}
{"text":"I am not the type of person to write reviews however I have been to Burntwood tavern a dozen times and have never been disappointed. The food is great and the staff is always personable. I try to make it for the happy hour, the specials are great! I made it in again last night and my server Josh was the best server I have ever had anywhere. I will make sure to ask for him again next time."}
{"text":"When here for anniversary dinner. The steak was cold I had a piece of fish that look like it was on a football field tasted like french fries nothing was warm thankfully we did not pay a red cent but we will never go back it was horrible. The fish was so cook it was dry and horrible. Look at the picture."}
{"text":"Love the Burntwood. Drinks are fantastic, food is always tasty, and the service is good. Our go to place for dinner and happy hour! Try the Tavern Saint martini and the scallops entree - YUM!"}
{"text":"Go to this place pretty often. The service has gone noticeably down hill. The hostess Liz is fantastic, covering for the waitresses when they don't do their job. Bartenders are also pretty inattentive even when they are not busy. Food is decent, at least several options on the menu: burger, chicken sandwich, salmon wrap, fish sandwich. Sweet potato fries are good."}
{"text":"Love Burntwood Tavern in Rocky River and was exited to try the new one in Fairlawn.  Must have been an off day for them.  Went in for lunch on Saturday at 1:00. There were several tables occupied but definitely not packed. The three of us were seated and waited on promptly but it took 35 to 40 minutes just to get our salads.  After finishing our salads we waited at least 10 more minutes to received our sandwiches.  The sandwiches weren't up to Burntwood standards - edible but very mediocre at best.  Sweet potato fries were the star.  We'll give them another try in a few months hoping by that time they've got it running smoother."}
{"text":"$5 for a house salad that was 1/4 cup of lettuce and dressing!!! That's it. The berry salad was basically a piece of salmon on a few greens for $13 at lunchtime. Not a value. Skimpy!"}
{"text":"Great black bean burger. The tarot tots are amazing too, not just frozen fried nuggets...real custom tots. I've been here several times throughout the years....always had good service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love burntwood's happy hour specials, but not from this location. After going to the chagrin falls and Solon locations multiple times, I decided to stop by the Lyndhurst location while I was in the area.   First thing- as we were walking in, two old people give my friends and I dirty looks and tell us to put pants on (we were wearing shorts because it was a nice spring day). Then when we got in we receive many looks from people who obviously thought we were peasants or something. Apparently you have to dress and look a certain way to be accepted by the regulars here  Second- happy hour is from 3-5. We got there at 440 but there was a 15 minute wait. I asked the host of we would be able to get the happy hour deal since we arrived in time and should have been seated in time. He looked at me and my friends and said \"unfortunately not, by the time you get seated it will be over.\" This was total bs and any place that wasn't so uppity would have been fair about it. Again we were seen as peasants and unwelcome in the restaurant  Third- we told him we were leaving and to take us off the list because we really only wanted the half price apps (the normal prices are very expensive and not worth it), and he got so frustrated for no reason. As I was walking away I heard him say \"at least we don't have to deal with them anymore.\" We again were judged based on how we looked and our age. Complete bs  Overall, this place has good food and the apps are a great deal during happy hour, but don't go unless you are dressed to the nine if you want to be treated with respect. The other locations aren't like that, but the people at this one definitely have big sticks up their butts and think they are better than everyone else. I highly recommend going to the chagrin falls or Solon ones instead if you can"}
{"text":"The food great !!!! The service on the other hand,,,,,   Wow!!  We waited 45 min after being told  it would be 20 min. The server never brought utensils !!! Came by to check on us, I think once !!   Wow sub par dose not even begin to describe the service here !!!  And this was on a tuesday night, i would expect bad service on a busy friday or saturday , but tuesday ??? Great atmosphere at the bar ! Next time I will eat at the bar !!!"}
{"text":"5 of us for early dinner. No one was overly impressed or disappointed. I had the salmon blt. Very little salmon or flavor other than the bacon. Chip appetizer was good. Beer and wine was well priced since it was early bird time."}
{"text":"Moscow mules all day! Especially during happy hour. $5  bar service is great although 2 out of 3 times in the dinning room seating I've had horrible service.  Food is always good though."}
{"text":"We went there for a Saturday brunch. We ordered 4 different items from the brunch menu. Overall the food was good - but the potatoes for example have clearly experienced one too many reheats and were borderline inedible. The waiting staff was more concentrated on conversing in the kitchen than attending to customers. It took 10 min. and numerous attempts to attract someone's attention to ask for some condiments. This is the first time we have experienced such bad service there. I hope it would turn out to be an exception, but it was quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Love this place!! We stumbled across Burntwood earlier this year and had a wonderful lunch with our children there so my husband and I chose to eat dinner at Burntwood Tavern on our first night out after our son was born and we couldn't be more pleased with the service or the food! It was a busy Friday night and we had to bring our son with us. The hostess was extremely accommodating, the servers were friendly and our food was brought our quickly. It was all very good! Toward the end of our meal, a gentleman (not sure if it was a manager or an owner) came up and gave both my husband and I a glass of champagne and congratulated us on the birth of our son. How awesome is that?! Such a nice gesture that added to the enjoyment of our evening out. Thank you Burntwood!"}
{"text":"The first time I visited BWT back in early September  I was with a group of 8 for Saturday brunch and was hungover so I only ordered toast and eggs. My friends got eggs Benedict with prime rib, salmon and breakfast burritos and said it was all very delicious. But the real reason we came to nurse our hangovers here was because of the Bloody Mary bar. But when we found out that mimosas (orange, pineapple or grapefruit) were only $5, we forgot all about the Bloody Mary bar. Service was ok but then again anyone giving you food and mimosas when hungover can't be terrible.   So I went back to BWT this afternoon sober and hungry. I went around 2pm, before happy hour and the place was just about dead, although there were a few people like myself scattered about the bar and at a few tables. The first thing j noticed when I sat down was the swarm of fruit flies around the beer taps. Since I've worked in many bars and restaurants, it didn't keep me from my food. But a few well placed cups of vinegar with holes poked into the covering Saran Wrap can help without the need for chemicals.   I ordered two Strongbow and the signature burger. The Strongbow was $7 and I felt that was a bit over priced even for draft. The burger was great; juicy and not over cooked and the fries were ok. I actually don't mind the fries in the paper bag because that lets me know that my oration will be the same size every time.   I was very content with my quiet lunch. I would suggest give this place a try, even if it's only for the $5 mimosas at Saturday and Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Great service!  Food is good, drinks are very good.  The tater tots were surprisingly great.  All in all a good night."}
{"text":"Had an unexpected night out with friends last week and The Solon area was the easiest place for us to meet. We chose Burntwood and had such an amazing evening! Ambiance- loved the rustic interior! Food- salads, flatbreads and sliders were all simply delicious! Service- David our server, made our night out memorable! He was very helpful, always smiling and very attentive to our needs! We shall definitely return, and request him!!! He is AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for Burntwood Tavern's one year anniversary at this location. Beautiful setting along the Cuyahoga River. The food is well prepared and the service is exceptional. If you come for lunch Monday through Friday ask for Tricia. She is so pleasant and outstanding as a server."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times since it's been open and last night will be the reason I will never come back. A man who has introduced himself as the general manager to me on my first visit was sitting at the bar with a drink in his hand near the end of the night. Completely unprofessional in my eyes."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good.  We always get the Zucchini Frites, and my daughter is a fan of any burger with an egg on it.  It's a little on the pricey side, so we don't go that often, but when we do, service and food are always quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here tonight. I ordered the pork chop which they were out of. We both ended up getting the prime rib special but our server Tyler didn't know what came with it. We got a few grilled vegetables thrown on the plate. We ordered an appetizer that we never got. Tyler never came back so I couldn't get salt and pepper or a water refill. I also heard another sever tell his table that the prime rib came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was a horrible experience and I wish I would've saved my 75.00."}
{"text":"Nothing was great. The meat was over cooked. The cadence of service was way off. The soup and salad came out before the appetizers. The smoked pork was not smoked but drenched in BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Tonight I found a foreign object in my food. A plastic marker for indicating doneness of meat somehow became wrapped in my chicken quesadilla. The management was apologetic and did not charge me for it, but this was Burnt wood's last strike. On previous visits we have had them attempt to seat us in the bar (with our 12 year old daughter) despite our making a reservation, lackluster service, and valets with attitude. I really wanted to like Burntwood but they have made that impossible."}
{"text":"4 for great views; right on the river - best during summer when you can sit outside.  The food is more bar than restaurant; so do not expect a higher end restaurant type of choices.  Limited choice of entrees, most of which are not expensive.  Decent bar food appetizers.  Always good service.  Valet parking.  Busy bar with younger crowd.  Good choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Loved the Rocky River location but this is definitely not the same. Food is okay if you like a cockroach in your salad. The manager was not too concerned and hardly apologized. Waitress was more helpful and apologetic than the manager. Won't be going back since I don't eat bugs and don't appreciate the managers unconcerned attitude."}
{"text":"Food was OK, drinks were strong. Our waitress was TERRIBLE! She didn't seem like she cared and the whole time it seemed like she was trying to rush us out. Offered us dessert then didn't give us time to decide before bringing the check. Rude."}
{"text":"Service was real slow. A+ for the fish and chips- burger was ordered medium came out well done. Chopped salad was weak.  Server was friendly- overall timing was off, drinks and food slow to arrive. Just an ok experience.  Will probably give it another try, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had the Burntwood Tavern burger w candied bacon for lunch the other day. Not a fan of this candied bacon, nor were my molars. Supposedly had lettuce and tomatoes on it too but I didn't notice them. The patty was kinda skinny, also. The fries were tasty. Thats the most positive part of the meal. Still like the Burntwood especially for happy hour half price apps but next time  Ill go for the prime rib/french dip."}
{"text":"::THE GOOD:: The building and atmosphere are awesome. Walked in and and they had a live band playing. It smells like a cozy fireplace. Decor was unique and rustic  The fries are very, very good.  My wife and I shared the chop salad. I recommend it.  ::THE BAD::  My wife and I both ordered coffee and they both came out cold, were never refilled.  I ordered the burntwood burger medium well, and it came out barely rare. Obviously I sent it back and that took about 15 minutes. (To their credit they didn't charge us for it.)  After the burger came out the 2nd time it was cooked correctly, but was very bland. Bread was dry, burger had no flavor. I do not recommend this meal.  My wife ordered the chicken avocado flatbread. It came out kinda warm, but was completely too crumbly to pick up. Had to pick at it with a fork the whole time. Very average.  At one point our server left a beer glass from another party on our table as she was taking away  some plates. Kinda gross.   If this place can ever get their food on the same level as their atmosphere they will be in business."}
{"text":"Our experience was awful. We waited 45 minutes for our appetizers (2) to come out.  The manager came to the table and apologized and told us she would comp the appetizers.  Upon eating the appetizers.. Pumpkin ravioli and calamari we found hair in the toppings on the pumpkin ravioli. The calamari was just fair. We then waited another HOUR for our food to arrive!  And the best part is that one of the entrees was cold. The pork loin which had been cut into boneless chops was tough as shoe leather. We couldn't wait to leave and won't be back. The positive is that our waitress couldn't have been nicer. She just kept apologizing and it clearly wasn't her fault. The table behind us had sent their food back as well...  Must have been a really bad night for her as well. Too bad..."}
{"text":"I was there today for a Geek Girl Brunch Cleveland event. This place - OMG! The decor, food, service! It was all excellent!  I went there a few days beforehand to get the lay of the land, so to speak. Talked with the manager, Jim, who answered any questions I had and made suggestions of how to setup the room for our event and so forth. Everything ran so smoothly. Of course, when there are 5 officers at a brunch, things can be confusing, but the venue had it under control.  Ashton and Jeff handled our party of 30+ easily. They made sure we had everything we needed.  We were given the loft, and were assured that we wouldn't disturb people if we did a scavenger hunt and made announcements, because the noise was self-contained.  There was no hiccup with orders, and everyone appeared to be having a good time.  We definitely want to come back there for another event."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Burntwood!  Their happy hour is the best!!!  7 days a week until 6pm-  you can't beat that!  The half price appetizers and flatbreads that I've ordered during happy hour are amazing!  I love the tater tots, chicken quesadilla, tuna nachos, zucchini frites, hummus tray, and shrimp tacos.  My mom loves the firecracker shrimp and chicken chili.  And the $5 cocktails are incredible!  I love that I am satisfied and I spend less than $20 on two cocktails and two apps.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat lunch!  We have been going here once a week for the past 4 months and I have nothing but good things to say about it. The service is fast and friendly. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. Three of us eat better and cheaper than Applebee's!  If you go, get a table outside and enjoy the river while enjoying your meal."}
{"text":"The best thing going at Burntwood Tavern? Without a doubt, it's Happy Hour - EVERY day from 3 to 6 pm offering half price apps and pizzas and drink specials. Five of us each ordered an appetizer and a drink and the total was $45 (before tip). We had chicken sliders, burger sliders, a Sicilian flatbread (came out just barely warm...the sliders and sides were hot though) and two orders of tots. It was a meal! Our server was friendly and efficient. It's a super busy place so I've found sometimes the servers are there when you want them, other times not so much, but any staffer is happy to help out (asking for water, for instance). It's a loud place so that's a bit of a drawback (though some spots throughout the restaurant offer quieter settings). Another nice feature - they take reservations!"}
{"text":"So many positives at dinner tonight! 1. The restaurant accepts reservations. 2. Our server was efficient, knowledgable and friendly. 3. Everything tasted great - California chicken, Asiago crusted chicken, steak, French dip, pretzel app, etc.  4. Pricing seems appropriate for portion size. 5. Lots of side options instead of fries. 6. Moscow mules were on special for $3 each!"}
{"text":"This place had a big obstacle to overcome when they opened . They had to overcome the terrible reputation of the last two places that occupied this space . I am excited to say they did overcome the negativity and did a smashing job !!!!!!!!!!! Experienced   bar staff and a good selection of beer and wines . Good lunch and dinner menus . Priced at the higher end but a good place for a business lunch or a quick stop on the way home . Plenty of parking and walking distance for many ."}
{"text":"The food, when good, is really good. They can be uneven. Totally recommend the smoked pig wings!  They have a decent array of craft beers, but the beer prices are ridiculous. I got a 10 oz snifter of a double IPA and it was $8! Absurd."}
{"text":"This place has really good food in a great atmosphere served by people who are well trained. The zucchini fries are the best."}
{"text":"the price is reasonable, the service was fine, the atmosphere was nice, but the food, the food very sub par, i ordered the wood plank salmon, it was good but what a small portion, I dont think it was even 4 oz. for twenty dollars. it was served on a plate with 5 small pieces of burned asparagus, and a small amount of burned up shriveled vegies that i could not tell what they were they were so black. there was no bread or choice of sides with the meal. no bread before meal either....my girlfriend ordered the prime rib french dip sandwich at a cost of $11dollars. now her sandwich was huge for the price and came with fries. the fries were good but the sandwich itself had way too much bread, the meat was cold, so we sent back for warm up. the prime rib was smoked to death , tasted like eating a piece of firewood, the au jus was likewise horrible, it tasted like they poued whatever the rib was cooked in in a ramakin, just tasted like pure liquid smoke. i tried it and felt it was uneatable. my girlfriend ate probably 1/4 of it and could not eat anymore. we ended up getting a box for what was left (why we did that i have no idea cause went straight in garbage at home).... anyway 10 minutes after leaving my girlfriend started throwing up and that continued when we got home...dont think it was food poisoning cause it usually takes a while for thazt to set in, it is possible though. i think they just put too much liquid smoke, or left too much smoke during cooking. (when you smoke meat you only supposed to smoke for a little while, not the whole time it cooks. tasted way too smokey and burned tasting...horrible...was there one other time and i thought the food was ok but after this we will not be back. also my girlfriend called to explain the situation and was hung up on.....buyer take care, buyer beware"}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best!  Yummy shrimp tacos! The jack n Jill drink is delicious! Try the artichoke and roasted garlic dip!!"}
{"text":"Started my meal with a perfectly made Bloody Mary (I requested spicy).  Dinner was salmon and flat bread pizza.  Both were really good.  Dessert (creme brûlée) was delicious as well.  Service was great and food was delicious.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've always had such great service here! They have a great happy hour as well. Food has always been amazing! Love the river view! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was great for lunch today. I had the smokey grilled pork chop, it was excellent. Good charred crust, moist, thick cut. I wanted to naw on the bone!! The mixed veggies were perfect, they were charred as well, so tasty!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with a group of friends at the Lyndhurst location last night. I have been to the location in Chagrin Falls on many occasions and it has always been top notch.  This location is a very different story. The service was simply awful. We ordered drinks and they never came. Someone in our party had actually go tell the host find someone to bring us our drinks. It took them forever to come and take our order and they never even bothered to clear the dishes or empty glasses from the table.  We actually pile them all at the end of the table so we had room for our meal. This is the second time I've had service like this at this location.   Earlier this year I attended a work party here. We were \"not allowed\" to order drinks at the bar. We had to wait for our server and literally pay with our credit card every single time we ordered a drink. I wouldn't have minded that so much if the server heard actually shown up to take drink orders or brought them in a timely manner. Perfectly awful. I will not return here."}
{"text":"Awesome food & bartenders. Luv the chambly unibrouge beer. Decent prices. Nice place. Good decor. Good atmosphere. To be sure Friday's nights are not a night to have couple date night. It's mostly singles or geared that way it seems. So if you have a party of four or more save it for another night."}
{"text":"Calamari was great as always, we also went during crab season.. The crab cakes were spot on, and the soft shell crab po boy was delicious! Very satisfied!!"}
{"text":"This review isn't worth my time so I will get to the point. If I could give negative stars I would. If you have food allergies pay close attention here, additional ingredients were added to all of our dishes. Ingredients that were not on the menu, not told to us and certainly not welcome.   Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else unless you like a rude staff, even worse management team and a non transparent menu."}
{"text":"Burntwood has weathered the recent competition from the now closed (\"Tavern on 91\"). It's always interesting to see how new or stiff competition affects a restaurant. In this case, I would say it was all for the better. The seasonal menu is out and is definitely worth trying out a few items (e.g. Lobster Pierogi's!).  The observations from my previous review have seemed to effect positive changes, which is great as we all have room to grow. Consequently, business meetings and other group outings that were diverted elsewhere will not be brought back to this BWT!  All in all, this is one of the gems of Solon and is uniquely located to attract crowds from neighboring towns and cities.  Lastly, as this is patio season you'll be hard pressed to find a better local establishment than here. I personally recommend arriving early and making reservations as space is limited."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. I got salmon salad and I will get it again. Kyle got pork chop- he loved it - I didn't. My other friend got the special beef and it was HUGE. Like the food. Decorations awesome. Only downfall was we ordered old forester on the rocks, $25 bottle of booze, and they charged us as if they were Martini's at 9$ a pop. Not a deal and kind of left me disgruntled. I would go back just ask cost of drinks before ordering."}
{"text":"Very nice place tucked away next to the river. Get a seat outside on the patio. Had dinner last night and was very good. The only complaint I would have is the service, we waited a long time to get drinks and food. It seemed that we were forgotten at times and had to remind the waitress."}
{"text":"7p reservation. now standing here looking at AT LEAST 10 EMPTY TABLES at 7:25p not seated. told that chef, manager and servers have all walked off the job this evening. I came for my favorite flatbread... not sure we'll get that far. would be surprised if this place is still in business in a week."}
{"text":"Fantastic place.... Tammy,Matt and Dawn the manager were awesome... The atmosphere was incredible and super clean. Beer was cold and service was second to none.  Two thumbs up.  Will def be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"First visit to Burntwood and I will be back.   Stopped in for a meal with my father and it was hoppin even on a Wednesday night.   We were seated promptly and had some lovely cocktails soon thereafter.   Sat in the bar which has a great vibe and amazing views.  And I love all the glasswork lighting fixtures.     As for food...  I had the asiago chicken,  crispy breaded chicken on a bed of spinach and crispy potatoes... So good there wasn't a crumb left on my plate.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place on our way to a concert at Blossom and we were very glad we did. Happy hour deals were great. We ended up ordering a flatbread (1/2 off), an appetizer (all 1/2 off), and a burger to share between 3 of us. It was so hard to pick because everything sounded and looked so good but we left full and happy! Drinks were yummy too.  Aside from the great food, service, drinks...the atmosphere and views are worth the stop alone!"}
{"text":"I went to Burntwood in Cuyahoga Falls with my girlfriend, and we had a decent time. The food was good; we got a pizza to start and chicken salad and asiago chicken sandwich for entrees along with a few cocktails. The meal was slightly expensive, $80 with tip but we were expecting it to be around that. Waiter was nice and helpful but he had no familiarity with the drink menu or what was on tap (the reason for only 4 stars), we attributed it to the restaurant being fairly new & it didn't ruin our experience. We really enjoyed the mellow, relaxed environment conveyed. Overall, decent food, good environment and average service. We will go back, maybe not as soon as some other restaurants as we weren't \"wowed\" with the total experience."}
{"text":"The burntwood tarven solon is much better. This one is just ridiculous. Waiting time was bad. Food was okay. Worst salad I ever had. It was so dry. The calamari was not the best. ***The waiter does not know what splitting a check means***** would not recommend and would not come back. This place is overall horrible. don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"This past Saturday, I visited Burntwood Tavern, Cuyahoga Falls in a party of five to celebrate my mom's birthday.  It was not a very good experience.  We had a reservation and were seated on time but after we were seated, no server came to take our drink order for a good 10 minutes.  Since it took so long, we were ready to order once the server came to the table.  Three of the five ordered salads.  Our entrees consisted of two filet dinners, a filet medallions dinner, a fish tacos dinner and a pizza. We never received our salads and when the entrees arrived, the contents of all three steak meals and the pizza were all cold.  To top it off we were seated in a long room with booths along one side and two long tables down the middle, each with large and very loud party's.  It's one thing for a restaurant to be loud, this was so bad we couldn't even have a conversation without yelling.  A manager came to the table to apologize for the problems and they offered us free dessert, but we had birthday cake at home so we declined.  With these issues and for the sake of a return visit, I was expecting some form of discount on the bill.  But no, nothing.  We thought the food, cold as it was, had good flavor - they get one star for that and one star for our server who was nice and had no control over these problems.  We may go to another Burntwood Tavern location in the future but definitely not the Cuyahoga Falls.  I hope to find a better approach to customer service in a different location."}
{"text":"I really liked the stake salad!!! Food and service were good."}
{"text":"I went here most recently while visiting Ohio and catching up with some old friends.  Even though we had reservations, our group of 7 was seated in the bar.  Fine, until about 10 minutes later when the band shows up.  Right next to our table.  Amplified.  So much for catching up.  To quote the Grinch (and let my inner cranky old lady out): \"The noise, the NOISE, THE NOISE.\"  Not sure why they needed amplification in this small space, but I have no idea how my friends have been doing for the past year and no idea when I'll see them again. We all ordered drinks and they were good, but overpriced.  My husband and I split the hummus appetizer and the veggie burger (we chose Burntwood for the location--central to all of us--and because there were several vegetarians in our group and they had a few options for us).  One of my friends also got the veggie burger but asked for asparagus instead of fries.  She got a very stingy 5 or so stalks of asparagus.  The food was good and our server, Josh, was great; unfortunately, because of the noise level, we couldn't wait to leave."}
{"text":"Let's start out on a high note. Setting and atmosphere was absolutely beautiful. High note ended. The wait staff was inattentive, minus when it was time to pick up the check. Ordered the dip sand which and the cheese crusted chicken sandwich along with a spinach artichoke dip (as a app). 15 minutes goes by and our food comes out (which is great don't get me wrong but where is our app?) the food was average at best. Under seasoned soggy bread and in my personal opinion inedible. 25 minuets later our waiter finally checks on us and then runs to go see what is going on with our app. I told him not to worry about it due to our food already being served. The manager comes out shortly after and offers us a \"free\" app seeing it did not come out on time. I appreciate what the manager did to try and make the situation better but in my personal thoughts it was not worth the bad service or food. My husband and I came in hungry and left hungry and now have to find another place to eat because we couldn't eat that slop. My husband eats anything and he would rather had a pb&j sandwich then eat here again. Needless to say we will more than likely not be returning. I do appreciate the managers generosity with trying to fix the situation. But I will not be wasting my money here."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am not sure what the rave is about the Burntwood. Yes, it has good food. But it has never blown my socks off. Last time I went here, I got the Asiago crusted chicken sandwich, and I had to add salt and pepper to it because it was so bland. The iced tea also had a distinct coffee aftertaste (and I hate coffee, so even though it might not bother some people, it bothers me because I am very sensitive to it). I remember really liking the Burntwood when it first opened, but I feel like it has gone downhill throughout the past year or so ... not sure what happened. I mean sure, I will eat here again occasionally, but it's not my first choice."}
{"text":"Great service (Thanks, Robby!), great food and how 'bout that Southern Tier Mokah?  Many of the previous reviewers were not pleased with the crowds but we didn't experience any wait or a packed dining room because we stopped by at about 9pm on a Sunday.  For starters, we ordered the tater tots and my son (the pescatarian) ordered the tuna nachos for his entree. Those tater tots are something else... Not at all like the kind of tots mom baked from frozen. The potato inside was seasoned with herbs and the tots came with a cream cheese and artichoke dip garnished with a few pickled onion slices and green onions on top.   My husband always asks about the darkest beer on tap because we have an affinity for dark, malty beers and have had MANY great ones (and some bad ones) over the years. By Robby's suggestion he went for Breckinridge Brewery's Vanilla Porter--which was excellent. Really smooth and not overly sweet. Robby also suggested the Mokah and brought over a sample to taste. Yep. That sealed the deal. I think I could write a whole review on that one delicious beer. It reminded me of my favorite Old Rasputin from back home. Sweet, creamy, bitter, smooth, caramel, and coffee flavors... I could drink it with breakfast it that kind of thing was socially acceptable. But I digress.  My daughter got a plain cheeseburger, cooked to perfection and I may have eaten a quarter of it when she wasn't looking. Shh!  The tuna nachos were tasty, from the bite I traded in exchange for a tater tot.  I ordered the salmon and berry salad and the portion of salmon was hearty. The salad itself was well-composed. I usually order my dressing on the side and needed very little to add to the salad's flavor. Raspberries pair very well with salmon.  My husband got the fish sandwich and he ate it all so I am assuming he liked it.  For dessert there are these genius little mugs with chocolate cake or apple pie with a scoop of ice cream on top. We ordered two to share between the four of us felt absolutely satisfied.  Never having been to Cleveland..or Ohio, in general, we're thankful for this welcoming meal and the great service we received here. If we ever have an opportunity to come back, we will."}
{"text":"I'm downgrading my review based on the food.  The food alone would only get 2 stars, but the ambiance and happy hour earn it a third.  I've been here 3 times now, and every time the food has been disappointing.  My second visit was the worst.  I had the gazpacho and chicken quesadilla.  The gazpacho was awful.  I could taste nothing but worcestershire sauce.  i prefer it blended, not chunky, but that's just my taste.  the chicken quesadilla was also bad, and i didn't think you could mess those up.  The salsa it came with tasted odd, like there was wine or vinegar in it, and the portion was small.  My in-laws love it though, so there must be something good on the menu.  And the happy hour deals are pretty good, so I'll go back for drinks.  We've always had good service as well."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre,  fruit flies enjoyed my drink as much as me.  Good thing the waitress found it amusing.  Food was good.  Could have been larger portions considering the price.    We had tavern chips, very good..  but small quantity,  steak salad was good, had shrimp tacos. .... would have loved them as a main course on the menu with a few more."}
{"text":"Honestly every time I go here, I always have such high expectations, and I get let down. I wish I could give it 2.5 stars. I made reservations for 730, and our waitress got sat all at once, which I realize isn't her fault and she was doing the best she could, but it was 15 min before she even came over for the first time to get our drinks. She kept apologizing, but it still took forever. Then once we ordered around 8, we didn't get our food until after 9. I got a special, the Shrimp Po'Boy. There was way too much bread and not enough fillings. I ended up just picking the shrimp out of the sandwich and eating them solo. It was also cold, which I didn't think it wasn't supposed to be, considering it was fried fish. My boyfriend got the salmon and said his was cold too. I've been to several of these around Northeast Ohio, and I am always underwhelmed by the food. It's not the worst, but it's not worth the price.  Sidenote: there was absolutely no regular parking available, only valet. Which we would have been fine with if the 18 year old valet guy didn't come whipping an SUV into the parking lot and almost take off the side of our car while we were in line.  I think it will be awhile before I go back to any location of the Burntwood."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but every time I go (and I've tried various locations), it really lets me down. The service is amazing, but I feel like the food is always such a letdown. At this location in particular, I felt super bad because our waiter was double sat with tables of 6+ - not a good situation for even the most experienced server. He was trying so hard, but kept making mistakes (wrong orders were put in 2x) - but he kept profusely apologizing for it, and the manager came over as well. They made it right in the end, and they took the items off of our bill. So no fault there. But the food - I am not sure if they changed suppliers in the past year or what, but the food has been so bland. I've been to the one by Independence, the one in Rocky River and the one in CFalls in the past year, and it's all the same. I used to love the Burntwood. But I feel like the food quality has gone downhill. It is just bland - and it's more than one item as well. I got the chicken and avocado flatbread this past weekend (more like a pizza, btw) and there was just no flavor. I try to keep an open mind and say that it just might be the order that I put in or it's an off-night for the restaurant - 4th time this year might the charm, right?"}
{"text":"food is subpar. Server served with a full long uncovered beard. Slider had plastic cooked into it. Tater tots are not really tater tots so don't expect them. Didn't like the environment or the peeps. Won't be returning to this one."}
{"text":"On 9/27/2014, we had an engagement party for my daughter and future son-in-law, with about 36 people in attendance.  From the time we started planning this event with Mike Krebs (General Manager) of Burntwood Tavern about 1 month ago until the event took place yesterday, we were completely satisfied.  We had the back room, which was perfect for our group.  Our waitresses, Jamie and Taylor, were phenomenal in taking care of everyone.  We had delicious appetizers and drinks first, followed by an amazing buffet meal.  We had brought our own cake, which the staff took care of cutting, plating and serving, followed by a champagne toast (compliments of Burntwood Tavern).  Everyone in our party was pleased with the food and service.  If you are looking for a place for a party, I highly recommend this place.  My family has had other much smaller get-togethers here and have always been pleased.  Well done, Burntwood Tavern and staff.!!!"}
{"text":"I am at a loss for words.  The only positives to my trip here were: A: I was with my family who I don't see that often B:  the manager and chef both admitted to how terribly they dropped the ball and how sorry they were.  We arrived at 8 on the 4th of July, and it was pretty crowded, which is a good sign, but given that tons of restaurants are closed, not surprising.  Our server came out and took drink orders, then forgot one of the three beers ordered when she came back.  On her return, one more drink was ordered as well, but it took her ten minutes to come back with my beer and the drink my sister ordered.  We decided it was a good time to order appetizers, and asked between a few options, on her recommendation we got the tuna nachos, which they ended up being out of.  We instead opted for calamari and the southwest flatbread.  The calamari was bland and not crispy.  Tastes like there was no seasoning, and of course at a pretentious place like this, god forbid they put salt and pepper on the table.  Our server was no where to be found, so instead of eating cold properly seasoned calamari, we had hot, unseasoned, and still soggy calamari with a bland tiny ramekin of sauce that was reminiscent of ragu.  Our flatbread came out 10-15 minutes after the calamari, and was the shining star of the evening.  It was crispy, cheesy, and the chorizo had great flavor (I would have liked more as it was a little scarce, but overall good).   We then waited.  And waited.  And waited.  For the first time in my life, we actually got up and asked the server where our food was.  She was completely oblivious to the fact at that point we had already been there over an hour and twenty minutes, only got appetizers, and a water refill.  She went and checked, and never came to the table til almost ten minutes later when the food was actually ready.  When our food arrived, the French dip I ordered was barely warm.  It wasn't that I was angry and trying to complain, it seemed that our food ( or at least my sandwich) was ready at least 30 minutes prior, because the bread was nice and soggy too.   The manager came out and got us some drinks (and eventually dessert) for our inconvenience, but I was so appalled at the service, and my food when it came out, buying the entire check couldn't have stopped me from expressing my anger thru this review....  I even waited a full day to see if I would still be as disappointed (I am) before writing a scathing review.  Back to the food....  The manager took my French dip back to the kitchen, and they warmed it slightly.  My dad's sandwich had the same problem, but he didn't want to bother at that point.  The reason I like a dip is the a jus.  Should be dark, rich, and have a clean salty flavor.  This was light, cloudy, and covered in a THICK layer of fat which made the already mediocre sandwich just pathetic.  As I sit in the airport across from Arby's, I can't help but think how much better their French dip is- so sad.  My mom and sister both enjoyed their food, neither of which I tried, and my brother in law and dad were complacent at best.    Dessert was a mixed bag.  Of the 5 of us, we ordered 4 different desserts.  We ordered two apple crostata which of course is what I got, and was the one dessert that no one enjoyed.  The apple itself was good, but the salted Carmel ice cream was over salted and didn't work with the pie.  The other desserts were good, but it was to little to late to make up for the evening."}
{"text":"Not the best, though not the worst.  I came here with a group and got really exceptional service from the waiter. He was an older gentlemen who was very classy. He did a great job of explaining all the dishes.  The dishes themselves were good, but a little overdone. Not that they were cooked too long, but rather, that there was too much going on in each dish. The flavors kind of clashed instead of complementing each other. There was a roasted tomato concoction that seemed to make its way into more than one dish. While it was delicious alongside the hummus appetizer, it was kind of overwhelming on my chicken entree.  The caesar salad was wonderful.  The atmosphere was kind of odd. I am remembering The Pub, and I guess the layout hasn't changed, but it's sort of swanky now, which turns me off a little bit. The lighting was dim and it was really loud in there. Also, the hostesses were extremely robotic in the way that they stared at everyone coming and going with a vacant smize and an emotionless \"Have a good night.\" You know what I'm talking about.  However, despite the few minor flaws, I would give this place another try."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of their Happy Hour that I went two days in a row! During summertime I get off work at 3pm and surprisingly enough it is hard to find restaurants that are open that early let alone a happy hour that starts at 3! The deal is 1/2 off all appetizers and flat breads, $5 cocktails, $4 house wines and $3 bottles.  If you think you need a salad with your flat bread you are wrong. The flat bread is big enough to eat and take home some leftovers all for a happy hour price of $6! The first night I went I opted for the Blackened Shrimp Tacos- Great decision! They packed so much punch in flavor! They are on the smaller side but you get 3 and I was full. The second night I ordered the Tuna Nachos! Get the Tuna Nachos!! I was so impressed since I was not at a seafood or sushi restaurant. I've wanted those nachos everyday since!  Make sure you check it out!"}
{"text":"I come here quite often for happy hour and love sitting at the bar or on the patio. Happy Hour is from 3-6 Everyday! To me Burntwood has one of the best HH's because all their appetizers and flatbreads are half off (no restrictions)! Also, they have been getting a little more craftier with their mixed drinks by making their own in house infused vodkas."}
{"text":"I usually frequent the location in Rocky River because I live the closest to that one but I recently came to this location to meet a friend for happy hour and I have to say the staff and bartenders here are super friendly! As soon as I sat down the manager came over and started chatting with me. Every person I came in contact with here introduced themselves right away. What a fantastic customer service touch! I will be recommending this location to my friends on that alone!  Happy Hour is fantastic so make sure to check it out! It's from 3-6pm and it's 1/2 off ALL appetizers and Flatbreads, $3 bottles, $4 house wines and $5 signature cocktails."}
{"text":"I love burntwood. Great happy hour food and drink specials. Patio is awesome during warm weather. Owner checks with our table every time we visit. This place would make john taffer smile."}
{"text":"Spent a very pleasant evening there a few days ago on our anniversary. Pleasant venue, attentive, friendly employees AND a complimentary glass of champagne to celebrate the anniversary.  Really liked the steak salad and we will surely return."}
{"text":"Had their veggie burger. Would have to say, for being a vegetarian, it had absolutely no flavor. Felt like I was just eating black beans and mashed black beans. I did see what appeared to be cilantro but can't say I tasted any of it. I don't even think it was seasoned with salt and pepper. I had to ask for more ketchup because I used my whole first cup they gave me to try to flavor the burger. If I were a meat eater and tried it for the first time, I'd never have a veggie burger again. I would also recommend a vegetarian to find something else unless eating plain black beans basically from a can is up their alley. The \"tomato aioli\" sauce also didn't add anything to it which I had hoped it would."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time because of work holiday party.  The restaurant is pretty expansive and looks and feels like you are walking into a ski lodge or somebody's log home.  The fireplaces and leather chairs and couches, make you want to have a couple drinks and just hang out for awhile.  The food was very average; I went in expecting so much more and came away disappointed.  Would I go back again on my own? Not sure, but that fireplace is sure inviting."}
{"text":"Great lunch/brunch stop. We enjoyed the lunch combo. Soup of the day (potato) was soul-warming, wedge salad was a hit, and the 1/2-sandwiches were gobbled up. The table pleasers were the dainty mug desserts: lemon bar topped with whipped cream and bread pudding with a wee scoop of ice cream.  Decor is modern rustic. Love the chandeliers in the bar area."}
{"text":"I'm between 3 and 4 stars on this one. Considering the price point is moderate, I'll go with the 3 stars. So, first impression was really good. The place was packed on a Wednesday night at 7:30. We had a party of nine, so while we waited for our table, we hung at the bar and everyone was ordering it up. I spent zero dollars for this dinner so I can't even comment on drink prices as I only had one glass of wine anyway. After about a 20 minute wait, we were seated in the back, behind the fireplace. It was pretty intimate back here, we were a little too close to the kitchen, but still not complaining.  For apps we ordered the lobster ravioli (really tasty and plentiful, yet too salty at the same time). The pumpkin pierogie was a special, and it was good, but the order seemed a little stingy. The chicken wings were ordered extra crispy, but weren't served that way. Also note, the were very smokey. I don't like smoky, and even if I did, they took it too far. The sauces that came on the side didn't compliment that well, this was my least favorite app. We also did the calamari, these were ok, I'd order again, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Finally, (I know, we're greedy) the fondue, I really did enjoy this with the pita versus the chips.   For my entree I did the filet mignon, asked for it medium, but it was served medium rare. I don't like medium rare. It was so charred on the outside, it tasted a little burnt. It had some butter on top, the insides of the meat had no flavor. My entree wasn't hot (I like my food smoking, it was as if they let it sit). So I do not recommend the filet, I have had way better at this price point else where, like the chop for example.   The sweet potato fries we're good, as expected, especially with some old fashioned ketchup. The asparagus was bland, needed some salt, garlic, butter, one or all would have been great. Go with the roasted veggies instead. The brussel sprouts we're yummy. So my filet with a potato and veggie was $26, I believe. Another reminder to leave the steak to the steak houses (in most cases). I should have went with my gut and ordered a sandwich or burger. I think if I would been here before and been in the know, I could have been a happy camper for around $25??? Instead, I was treated to a $40 mediocre dinner, and I didn't like my entree. If it wasn't for the apps, they would really have been dinged. Our service was cool, and we were with a tough croud!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the 2nd time during happy hour.  The food had a creative flair and was consistently good.  The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  We had just appetizers this trip, but were equally happy with the entrees and deserts on the last trip. It is nice to feel so well attended to in a casual dining setting such as this."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of Burntwood- open floor plan, nice decor, covered patio seating.  The food was pretty good and decently priced.  The service was decent- a bit on the slower side.  All in all a pretty cool place."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is chill, relaxing and soothing with the music background.  If you choose to sit outside, there is a lot to see with people and traffic passing by.   In the evening, the breeze is perfect. They were very busy but we were seated quickly.  Our waitress was very informative and accommodating.  Their margarita especial hits the spot. On a final note, their decor gets two thumbs up"}
{"text":"What a beautiful building! Very smoky aroma from the fire place but not annoying. I ordered the crab stuffed trout and let me tell you I did not regret it. It was delicious. And the caper lemon sauce made it. I am not a fan of capers but it was very good. The drinks were made well, and the server was very very kind. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but am going to throw up a review anyway.   We went to Burntwood recently and had some excellent cocktails and ordered apps to share. The 3 items we had were excellent. I LOVED the tuna nachos and blackened shrimp tacos. We also had the zucchini frites, which were great but the quantity served could have been larger.    there wasn't anything else on the menu that I was interested to try, and it looked kind of $$$ for the entrees. I'd go back for apps and drinks, and maybe to try a burger or something.   If you ride your bicycle there on a Tuesday, I think they offer a discount."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with fabulous drinks and eats had the fish tacos and they managed a table of 17 with great attention - beautiful location as well."}
{"text":"As far as pretentious Crocker park restaurants go, this one was bad. I understand it's in an upscale area, but that's no excuse for chargeing obscene amounts of money for pig slop. I ordered the tavern dip sandwich and my girlfriend ordered the margarita pizza. Lets start with mine. I ordered it without horseradish sauce...but it still came with the sauce. The prime rib that comes on the sandwich was basically still screaming moo, as in not cooked at all, and was soaked in some kind of sauce that was not disclosed in the menu but was aweful. My waiter (who was excellent) took it back and had them make it again. But when I came out for the second time it was more of the same. I had to stop myself from vomiting. My girlfriends pizza looked like someone squeezed ketchup on some matza bread and baked tomatoes and feta cheese on top. I didn't taste it...her reaction was all the testing I needed. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one was because our waiter DJ was very good. He was on point with everything."}
{"text":"This place is great! Super reasonable and good entrees only thing I don't care for is the calamari- too much breading not enough fish. The service is always good and the atmosphere has a very warm feeling. Highly recommend Burntwood!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to Burntwood Tavern after hearing many good reviews from friends. When we came it was decently busy and were seated right away. When we went to sit down there was a piece of green (salad?) food on one of the chairs stuck to it. We didn't use that chair and pushed it aside. The host noticed our table was very wobbly when he sat us down, so he proceeded to fix it for us. It took a little while for our waitress to come over so someone else got our drinks, which was nice.  My boyfriend got the steak salad and wasn't very pleased. The steak was cooked how he wanted, but cold. Also, the cheese was so big and clumpy that towards the end of the salad it over powered the taste. I got the California Chicken sandwich. It was absolutely delicious.   The pricing wasn't bad and my food was very good. I would come back."}
{"text":"Had a family dinner here on a recent weekend, to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday.  The interior of this longtime space has been updated / renovated and is very cozy and welcoming inside (including a roaring fireplace).  We ordered appetizers to share and then main dishes.  To share, we had both the tavern tater tots and the calamari.  Both dishes were tasty, the calamari was not overly breaded or chewy served with a pomodoro sauce and the tots were quite large and came with three separate dipping sauces.  My a main dish, I had the asiago crusted chicken which was pounded flat, fried and served over crispy potatoes and a small salad.  The chicken did not have much in the way of flavor and the flat nature of the cutlet tended to dry out the meat.  Our server was pleasant and the atmosphere nice, but there was certainly no \"wow\" factor in this meal."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly knowledgeable staff, comfortable contemporary environment - a nice addition to Montrose. My wife and I tried taco appetizer and French Dip to split at happy hour. We plan on making this place part of our rotation and tasting more of the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful meal tonight. We shared the Tavern Tater Tots appetizer. I enjoyed the Salmon Salad and he had the Asiago Crusted Chicken. All were very yummy and very well prepared. Add a couple glasses of Merlot on the patio with great service and the night was perfect. We would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Great first experience here. Steve was our server. He was attentive, courteous and brought our \"extras\" timely.  We had the tuna nachos, calamari and salmon BLT. All were good, especially the nachos. Well done, guys.  A nice touch was the bar manager bringing over two flutes of champagne because Steve relayed to him that we were here to celebrate a special occasion.  The red zin and Simi chardonnay were great. Their Moscow mule is nice a strong, though they could improve with non-lined copper mugs and adding mint - just my preference."}
{"text":"I've sat at the bar a few times for a glass (or two) of wine with friends. There's an undeniable \"burnt-wood\" quality to the interior and it is actually very warm and romantic. In fact, there's an undeniable \"burnt wood\" smell inside. I probably would give the place more stars without such smell, but I can't get over it. It is nauseating and I kept asking friends (each time I've been) \"Seriously? You don't smell that? That burning, chemically, turpentine-y smell doesn't bother you?\" To make matters worse, on top of the burnt smell, there's the sewer smell that sometimes tiptoes up to the dining area. I'm not sure what's going on with that, but I've smelled the same thing in Erie Island (next door). Luckily, the location of the smell in Erie Island is coming from the basement staircase, a long ways from wherever people eat/drink. You might be thinking, \"why did you even give it 3 stars if you get a headache every time you are there?\" My answer is that every time I'm there, the service is great, the food (fries!) have been wonderful, and none of my friends notice the smell. I can't guarantee other patrons will. If I go again and don't smell the burnt smell, I'll update my review. My guess is that the scent will dissipate with time.   So, in review of my review (ha!), service is lovely, food tastes lovely, smell of burning wood, not so lovely. If you are reading this and wondering if you should go, I'd recommend going. More than likely, the burning smell won't bother you."}
{"text":"Found this place on accident when going to a concert at the blossom music center. Food was fantastic, little pricey but worth it. 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"whites only? seriously this place is VERY white. no diversity here at all except for a couple servers. all of the customers when i was there were white. they take reservations for a place that isnt fine dining and doesnt have an interesting menu. hostess didnt listen when i asked for a booth, she tried to sit us at a table in the middle of the dining room.   fish and chips (the fish) was really overcooked to a dark brown. the tater tots are the exact same tots from the burger place called the rail which is like 200ft away from burtwood tavern. i was told that the tots are handmade and burntwoods recipe so they cant be the same but trust me, they are 100% exactly the same tots. chili is too spicy and the small cubes of prime rib in the chili were tough and chewy. the menu is quite boring. nothing on there that you cant get at other places.   the overall mood of this place seems to be quite serious which most likely comes from the managers. i got the vibe that there was some micromanaging going on and nobody was having any fun in there. it isnt a fine dining place/experience so im not sure why the mood is so serious and uptight. 2 managers were busing the tables, why dont they have dedicated staff for that job? the whole thing is odd to me. definitely not going back and wont be recommending it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Burntwood Tavern is a staple for me. Its a great go to for brunch, happy hour or dinner.  I have come here more times than I can count and every times they have been polite, accommodating and all around wonderful.  I will say I most often frequent for happy hour and their deals are pretty good.From 3-6 you get Half off appetizers and flatbreads and for drinks you have your choice of $3 beer, $4 wines and $5 cocktails. I would highly recommend the tuna nacho or fish tacos if you are a seafood fan.  If you are a fan of Moscow Mules stop by on a Thursday for $5 mules all day!  I was here last weekend for my Boyfriends birthday brunch and they accommodated our every growing group of 12 (Reservation was for 10). The food was delicious and our server made sure that our bottomless mimosa never ran empty. They had breakfast sliders and all of the people who had ordered them agreed they were pretty deliciously awesome.  I would say if you are looking for a place with a nice atmosphere, good food and tasty drinks Burntwood is defiantly a place to check out."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff. It has a casual cozy atmosphere - lots of woodwork, booths and a bar."}
{"text":"We have been several times and this is a family favorite!  We've all tried something different on the menu and have never had a miss. Excellent service.  You can call for reservations. FYI"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and service was good. My low rating is due to food quality and options. Everything was adequate, but not worth it for the price. It seemed as though everything was overly salted instead of properly seasoned. Also, more vegetarian/vegan options would be appreciated."}
{"text":"Great new venue for Chagrin Falls!  We had excellent service and food in this brand new restaurant.  Owner assured us of prompt seating even though it was opening weekend.  He was observed serving diners, solving issues and smiling all the while.  Welcome to the Chagrin Valley!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints always has something awesome to drink and eat. The view is awesome. I love bringing out of towners here it is a little gem with a perfect view of the river. Great food for all kinds and PLENTY to drink!!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was very nice and I loved the wood smell of the place. The decor and layout of the restaurant is quite pleasing and rustic without looking \"worn\". The five of us came for brunch on a Sunday, arriving early we were quickly seated, the place did fill up soon after we had arrived, partially because they were hosting a special event in one area but still not overly crowded. The noise level did get a bit loud, making it difficult to chat much across the table but I didn't mind. My family all ordered from the brunch menu and everything looked and tasted very good. I opted to order the Margherita flatbread which had a good flavor but I didn't care much for the crackerlike thin crust of the flatbread. I wouldnt have called it a flatbread given the baked tortilla like base. Overall I enjoyed my experience here, even though our waitress was somewhat forgetful, I would love to come back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Very good overall. Wasn't a fan if the pot stickers but that's not surprising. Enjoyed my burger a lot. Fries were good but nothing special. Have cool mini mug desserts that were tasty and a nice portion. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The first time we had to wait an hour for a table just for them to set up a tiny table in the lobby of the restaurant right in front of a speaker for live music and hungry drunk people waiting for a table on the other side of us. The smoked prime rib sandwich was awesome though. The second time we went we didn't have to wait to get seated but the food wasn't as good as the first time. My wife was disappointed."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow. We ordered at least a half hour ago and no one has even checked on us. All the tables around us seem to be the same way."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really nice with open patio and large bar area.  Fireplaces and stone work are cozy.  We sat at the bar and burger and sandwich with fries were good but took awhile.  I think our bartender forgot us.  Otherwise a fairly nice experience."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a friend on Saturday  The service was outstanding.  The food was yummy.  The servings were a little bigger then they needed to be but I had enough for two meals so that's not bad.  The wine list could be a little bigger but I get it.   That's not there thing.     What impressed me what how the place looks.    Very cool.    Yes I will be back !"}
{"text":"This place is just so average... Really.  I guess in this area it must be considered good. The food is better quality than bar food. I give them credit for that. The drinks are not as good.  I honestly have not been able to find a drink I like there. The drink selection is not good. I wish I could say it's different.   Last week we carried out lunch... Yuck!  My salad was wilted an I could not eat most of it because the lettuce was bad.  For real... You have to try to mess up a salad. Fresh lettuce is the first and most important ingredient."}
{"text":"The patio spaces (yes, spaces) at this location are amazing!!! The bar patio, in particular, has spectacular views of the river. The food is awesome and never disappoints, and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Everytime I am in town, I like to stop in for their tuna nachos. Love the pretzel bread too. A fun place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Rustic chic decor, nice patio area, and prompt service.  The food is yummy too! My parents and I came here for lunch on a Thursday, we are in town from SoCal. I ordered the combo half grilled chicken sandwich and half salad little gem salad. It was excellent. Fresh, healthy, and filling ! Can't complain and it was a beautiful day outside to eat on the patio !  Come check them out"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to sit at the bar and boy did we quickly regret it. After 10 minutes of staring like a deer in headlights I had to ask for a menu. Someone was kind enough to pour us water, but we had to get up and find some straws, coasters, and silverware. The bartender was working like the entire US Congress was eating at Burntwood. The restaurant wasn't even busy....there were 7 customers at the bar. We watched as he poured his drinks and what a waste of booze. I don't think bartenders make drinks that fast on New Years....slow down cowboy. It was so comforting to watch him never wash his hands. He also placed the clean rack of dished right in front of us. Very rude and inconsiderate \"bar tender\".   Our food came quick and it was good. No one ever came to ask us how the food was which was disappointing because I needed more ketchup. The bar had 4 people working and not one of them showed any interest in receiving a good tip. The restaurant manager was behind the bar at one point and didn't bother to ask how our meal was. I didn't even know who our server was because there were so many servers behind the bar. Cheers to the happy hours specials, but I'll never go back. You can get the same mediocre food at Applebees."}
{"text":"Was disappointed. Went for the wings, my husband raved about the wings and they were taken off the menu. Sub par food for the price. I gave it 2 stars for the rustic atmosphere and decent happy hour."}
{"text":"God awful. I was seated at a table that was not cleaned well. I ordered the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer and a Margarita flat bread for dinner.  The spinach artichoke dip arrived first and was cold. The chips and pita tasted old and it was kind of soupy. Within a few minutes my Flatbread arrived. It was also cold and flavorless. The waitress did not even inquire about my meal when I asked for my check having taken only one bite of the Flatbread.  Definitely one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had."}
{"text":"We went for the first time tonight. We weren't sure what expect but we really wanted to try it. The decor is very rustic in a glam sort of wast. Our server was great. The menu isn't huge but I liked a lot of the choices given. The food was wonderful and we are looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"We had the best night. Table out on the river, great food and a wonderful server.  We are looking forward to returning soon!  Loved my shrimp cob salad."}
{"text":"I've waited two weeks to write this review because I really wanted to make sure I was being fair and accurate.  Not much has changed in my thinking over it for two weeks!    We arrived for an early lunch.  Not many people there yet.  It took awhile for a waitress to take our order but she was very pleasant and efficient once she arrived.  We placed our order and then waited....and waited...and waited.    Twenty five minutes later the waitress stopped by to say the manager would be at our table shortly.  After a few minutes our sandwiches arrived with the Manager.  He apologized for the long wait time and stated our sandwiches were made incorrectly and needed to be remade and that this meal would be on him.  \"Great\", we thought and decided to enjoy our meal regardless of the delay.   Uhmmm....the bad news?  The sandwiches were not only made incorrectly still but they were cold and tasted as if they had been sitting out for the entire time.  We both ordered a grilled chicken sandwich...the bread was so soggy and the chicken was tough and tasteless.  I felt sorry for our waitress and we did leave her a nice tip....kitchen issues were not her fault.  I don't think we are up to a return visit."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, friendly service. Check out the calamari and Prime Sirloin Chili appetizers. Wood roasted half chicken and asiago crusted chicken are great entrees. We come here often and plan to keep it up."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere.  Fantastic pretzel bread.  We have now been to five of the Burntwood restaurants.   All are top of the line."}
{"text":"We really enjoy going here once in awhile. Limited menu but we have had a few different items from the menu and they have all been really good!"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere great but service terrible.   Saw the server 3 times in 1 hour.  No second drink and no dirty plated taken. Hope it was just him."}
{"text":"Took my son and his three buddies here for happy hour as it was one buddy 21st birthday.  The service was great and the manager gave us special attention.  We all had a round of Champaign on the house to celebrate!  The food was outstanding.  The groups two favorites were the shrimp taco's and the calamari with the flat breads a close third.  I believe we order at least every app on the menu twice, as that became dinner.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Friendly bar backs....a big bonus. Good food and beer selection. ....what's not to like."}
{"text":"If you are a bacon fan, you must try their club sandwich.  It has a ton of it!  The first time we visited I tried their philly and it was pretty good, no complaints.  I had it with the tater tots since that's what the hype was, and actually was not that impressed.  I think there wasn't enough texture for me.  My guess is they are something like fried mashed potatoes.  Either way, they just didn't do it for me and I love a potato.  The second time I had fries which I enjoyed much more.  Not too bad of a place for lunch if you get water to drink, but it could get pricy.  Enjoy the patio when it's nice or the fire inside on a snowy day."}
{"text":"I went to Burntwood while visiting from out of town. Located along a corridor of outstanding restaurants in the Chagrin Falls area, I expected a great meal and experience. For the most part, my expectations were met.  Upon entering, the restaurant is clearly cozy and unique, with the look of lodge and reclaimed wood furniture. Very warm feeling, albeit a bit too cozy. When you enter you walk immediately into the bar area with little room for the hostess stand and space to wait for your table. We had reservations, so the wait wasn't long and the staff were nice.  We were seated in the middle of the restaurant at a table that gave us plenty of room for our party of 4. The tables were a bit close together, but not uncomfortable. Our waitress was very nice and sociable and was quite honest about what drinks and meals were good and what she'd recommend. In passing I had mentioned it was my son's birthday, and while we waited for our meals, the manager brought us glasses of champagne to celebrate (ginger ale for my son).  I had a mojito cocktail which was quite good. The waitress was honest with us in that she said one of the bartenders knew how to make them right, the other, not so much.   I had the roast pork tenderloins with roasted vegetables. The roast was quite tender and cooked right and had a delicious glaze on it. The vegetables were very good. I had only wished that the food was hotter when it arrived, as it was merely warm. My son had the fish of the day special and he said it was good.   Dessert options are limited. Like many restaurants, they offer the small cups of desserts. I don't mind this as an option - but not thrilled it was the only option. I had the mixed berry cobbler cup and it was delicious. But, I'm old fashioned; I like some choices for desert...cake, pie, sorbet. And a candle in a shot glass filled with fudge cake wasn't what I had in mind for my sons birthday.  Would I go back? Sure. Maybe more for lunch or drinks and snacks. They have a nice bar area and a pretty outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the Burntwood Tavern today. Stopped on a whim as we were passing by and decided to give it a try as at first look it had a nice vibe. The atmosphere is cool and we were welcomed right away by what I think was the owner or at least manager. I like the decor and the layout. It wasn't very crowded at 11:45, although the crowd was getting better as we left. I had the California Chicken sandwich and my wife had the Fish N Chips. The sandwich was good and my wife's wish was good as well. As far as the food is concerned the only complaint we both had was the seasoning on the fries was way overdone. They were too salty and overloaded with other seasonings as well. Luckily I didn't like them, because the portion of fries was puny. The service was decent; didn't wait too long but wasn't exactly quick. Friendly wait staff. Our drinks were topped off more than once by more than just our waitress. I would probably give it another try, but won't make a special trip at this point.   Cheers"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, just needs to get their act together in terms of service (serving large tables with multiple servers and order-takers) and food. It's fine. I would go back but it still feels like the kinks need to be worked out."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a friend's birthday, they had rented out the patio area. The heaters were on overhead and it was comfy. There were lots of tasty appetizers and the margarita pizza was delicious! The bar service was hit or miss, 3.5 stars overall."}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time.  Décor is nice...comfortable.  Ordered the daily special omelette which was tomato, basil and fresh mozzarella.  The menu said it came with potatoes and fresh fruit.  My friend ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg and bacon also accompanied by potatoes and fresh fruit.  When our orders arrived and the waitress set my plate in front of me I almost laughed out load.  This was the smallest omelette I have ever seen in my life.  Maybe a 1 egg omelete???  There were 4 very small potatoes and a cup of fruit.  I wish I had taken a picture....it looked like something off of a kid's menu.  I will say the flavor was very good...just wish there was more as I left the restaurant hungry.  My friend's sandwich, on the other hand, was huge.  Her plate had about 6 of the small potatoes with a cup of fruit.  Fruit was good and fresh.  Gave a 2 star rating because my dish was a joke for the price.  Very disappointing.  Will definitely go elsewhere for brunch in the future.  Truly the most disappointing brunch I have ever had :-("}
{"text":"We've gone there for drinks with friends a lot.  Dinner menu is reasonably priced.  But mine had a TON of salt in it!  Are they in business with my cardiologist???   Other than that, when you are at the bar, there frequently is a cold draft of air from the doors.  Would be great if they could address that..."}
{"text":"At this place, I always get a good service and food. I ordered an Asiago Crusted Chicken Sandwich which was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"First time to the restaurant and the Brecksville location. The upgrades & renovations are very impressive.  I had dined at the previous restaurant shortly before they closed.  I was pleasantly shocked at the appearance and vibe of the place (great score with the new covered patio).  A coworker and I decided to grab lunch there on a whim.  Despite a very full parking lot at 12:20, we were seated immediately in the bar.  The menu is interesting and took some time to nail down a decision.  I opted for the lunch combine of a wedge salad and half a chicken Philly.  My buddy got the same combo with a Cuban sandwich.    Flavor, temp and presentation were spot on.  Honestly, I can't wait to go back for the chicken Philly.  REALLY good!  Portions were pretty disappointing.  10 bucks for 1/8th of a head of iceberg and a half sandwich that was maybe 4 bites was a downer.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our meal but left hungry....joking about the \"girl\" portions offered.  Service was odd but acceptable (clearly lacking in experienced servers).  Lunch for 2, before tip, with 2 sodas was 26 bucks.  Lockkeepers or Delmonico's I'd expect those prices for lunch.  I'll give it another shot as the food was so good and chalk this up to a poor menu choice on my part."}
{"text":"50/50 split for our first visit to the Falls location of Burntwood.  We had a great server, great drinks (happy hour), and appetizers.  The tater tots were, frankly, amazing.  I plan to get them & a salad for my meal on a return trip!  Our entrees were really not good.  I had the pot roast pappardelle.  I found it drastically under seasoned & underwhelming.  My partner got the smoked prime rib special.  He ordered his portion medium.  The first shot it was crazy rare.  Sent it back to return....rare.  He ate it more out of embarrassment & not wanting to create a fuss.  The portion ended up with more fat & waste vs. prime rib.  Neither entree was a winner - in our opinion.  The place was packed.  Tables were turned quickly & efficiently.    We'll be back for a 2nd try - probably on a weeknight to avoid the masses."}
{"text":"I've been to other Burntwood Taverns in the area, and this was the best customer service experience, by far. My mom and I sat at the bar and Chelsea and Animal took care of us. They were both so friendly and charismatic, I'd come back here in a heartbeat just to sit at the bar with them. Chris was the manager and he was so gracious and welcoming to us as well. Great environment here and I can't wait to come back to this location. If you don't have a rewards card, definitely ask your server for one!"}
{"text":"I was overly optimistic about this restaurant because it just opened and thought it was a reopening of a previous restaurant that was located in that location.   I ordered the ribs, it came with fries and coleslaw. I expected more for the price; the ribs were way too dry and needed much more sauce, the fries were just mediocre. Overall, just a very disappointing experience; even TGIF has better ribs!   my companion had the wedge salad, it was edible but nothing to get excited about.  I do like the look and decorations of the restaurant but most likely won't be returning for the food."}
{"text":"I am sad to update my previous review by saying: no more endless mimosas!   The brunch is still delicious. Today I had salmon eggs benedict which was delicious. I only wish there were more options without pork, as I don't eat it. I believe there were only 2-3 pork free brunch entrees and maybe only one meatless entree for my vegetarian friends.   I loved the Bloody Mary bar; however, without endless mimosas, it just isn't the same!  I'd stick to their happy hour which is 7 days a week from 3-6. Those are still great deals with all apps and flatbreads being half off!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group for brunch. Place is pretty nice inside, with a big outdoor patio. We went for patio, but unfortunately it was reserved today for an event. I can't dock it stars for that though. Where I'm giving it 2 stars was in the food.   First, the accuracy of the orders was pretty off. All 3 of yhe girls with me had either something missing, or an ingredient added in that they asked to have pulled. As for my order, I got the bloody Marie bar. The bar had your standard meats, bacon, cheeses, celery, etc... So that was looking good. However, the mixes were either extremely watered down, or one had chunks (maybe ice?) In it. When we tried to stir it, it started bubbling over, which was really odd. I went with the watered down mix and just added in more as I drank.   Then comes the food for me (which took a really long time). I got their prime rib Benedict and it came out very cold. Cold eggs, hollandaise sauce, and cold/soggy English muffins are not a good combo!   Finally, I will end with one redeeming point for the place. Their potatoes that came with our brunch orders are really in point. Definitely get these if you do come here."}
{"text":"I have given this place two times hoping it would get better. The first time we had a reservation for 8pm and didn't get seated until 9:15. We then waited for 45 minutes for our food. The fish  and chips we ok but the fries were the best part. The second time we got seated about 10 minutes after our reservation as it was dead. I order the pit roast sandwich and it was the toughest/dry meat I've ever had. Won't be returning for a mediocre 3rd meal. The previous restaurant was much better"}
{"text":"First time eating at a Burntwood Tavern and the experience was very pleasant. Came in on a Tuesday evening and the place wasn't too crowded, but they definitely had good business.   Started the meal with a field greens salad. Very basic salad, but had good flavor and was portioned well. For my entree I ordered the salmon, which was delicious! The smokiness from the cedar plank was present and all the seasonings were spot on.  In terms of the service, I'd say it was pretty average. Our waitress was very nice and answered our questions. However for the restaurant being relatively slow, I think the servers could have done a better job at checking in on guest's drink levels.   Overall, a good experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a low ranking for the awful food which didn't line up with the great description and prices.  Almost willing to give it a three as the structure and patio warrant a four."}
{"text":"The place is awesome!!  Great menu, great food and craft beer!  We have always been fans of the Burntwood Tavern's and this new one is just as good as the others!!  Well done Burntwood!"}
{"text":"Wondering what all the complaints are about. My husband and I just moved to this side of town and have been once for dinner and once for brunch.. brought our 8-month old baby and were more than welcomed with a little one which is always tough to find! Food wasn't spectacular but it wasn't crap either, I'd give it a 4 out of 5; service was good, fast and friendly and the atmosphere is great. Cozy.  We haven't gotten to sit at the bar yet, ahem, we have a baby. But I'm assuming we will get there shortly... once we find a babysitter!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times and I really enjoy their brunch menu and the breakfast sliders. I have always had a good experience, with fresh food, but sometimes the wait can be long. I also wish that there were more options on their menu, but what they do offer is great and the menu does change."}
{"text":"It wasn't impressive at all. Prices were very high considering that the dishes were not anything special. I told the person taking reservations it was my husband's birthday and she offered nothing to add that would make it more special. Not a huge deal, but would have been nice touch. We were seated in the first floor dining room. My sandwich order was wrong but it took so long to get that I decided not to say anything. There were a couple of big celebrations going on so it was VERY loud. Kids were running up & down the stairs and on the upstairs floor. Staff did nothing to stop them. Also table and chairs were rickety and badly in need of replacing. Another issue we had was fruit flies. I don't know if it was just our table or what, but it was really annoying. So for 2 drinks, one appetizer, and 2 sandwiches we paid $45+ and it really wasn't worth it. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed at all.  Had a bad experience at the Cuyahoga Falls location and this one I've eaten at twice and I'm not sure how or why they opened this new location.  Had the Shrimp app which is a copy of Bang Bang Shrimp but it was awful by comparison.  I've also had the smoked pork chop - They soak it in liquid smoke type brine.  It's not smoked so don't advertise as such.  Wife and I were both disappointed in our meals and have not been back since.  Applebees much better and more consistent (although that's not where we'd choose to go for a nice dinner).  However the ambiance of the place is nice.  That's about it."}
{"text":"Hello everyone- Good to see you've made it! Well. Hello. So. Hey. Anyway, there's areas of the bar that go up to your chin so if you like really strange eating/drinking situations this is your kinda place. Also, there was flowers on the bar and I felt that was slightly inappropriate. And they were red roses, which I feel is slightly out of season. Really, I'm perturbed because no one offered me a flower. Also (2nd also), the menu lacked emojis. I don't read good so it would be easier to read emojis. This was discriminating. You may be thinking well this review lacks emojis. You would be right UNTILL RIGHT NOW   I got a pretty tasty chicken sandwich and the bartender was coo, Yelp"}
{"text":"Disappointed with where this chain has gone, apparently quality has disappeared with quantity. Since first opened, service has deteriorated greatly and as well as pure taste of the food. I guess the owners just got too caught up with decorations and not on making the food. Could definitely benefit from expansion of the menu. Every time I've been I have gotten the, \"that's it!?\" Feeling and felt like there is not much to choose from."}
{"text":"I've been to Burntwood many, many times and have always had the most amazing dining experience. Their servers are amazing, and the staff is very very friendly. If you are celebrating something, sometimes they compliment you with champagne. Many restaurants should follow the business model Burntwood Tavern portrays. Plus- they have the best happy hour ever! Check our their website!!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal with this place- the new owners did an excellent job on renovating the space.  It's got a great rustic look that is certainly very inviting.  The bar space has been redone and has some couches and a huge fireplace that will be great in the winter for a beer and some apps.  From what I understand, they took a lot of the interior wood from some old barns in the area.  Reclamation of building materials is commendable.  The problem is that I go to a restaurant for more than the look.  I go for the food.  Read on.  So my family and I stopped in here for lunch.  We were there just as it opened for the day.  Immediately something didn't seem right to me as I was sitting at the table.  Then I figured it out- the tables are super low.  Either that, or the chairs are too high.  Makes the dining experience uncomfortable.  The tables also have this cool place mat that covers the whole table.  I picked ours up to look under and found that they apparently don't change the linens between services.  There was a ton of crumbs and old food all over the black tablecloth.  Kind of a turnoff.  Linens are the easy part of a restaurant.  Not a great start.  Then I ordered a beer because the Southern Tier Pumpking is incredible.  I ordered a short.  They brought me a lowball glass with some beer.  Where are the pint glasses?  The real shocker was when the bill came and this piddly 8 ounce pour was SIX DOLLARS.  What a joke, but I'm a guy with a sense of humor.  Read on.  The menu is what I would call uninspired at best.  Everything on there has been done at other restaurants.  Where's the creativity in the kitchen to match that of the remodel of the building?  I had to laugh when the server told us that it was going to take another month or two to come out with a SOUP because this was a \"chef's driven menu.\"  You've gotta be kidding me with that one.   A month for a soup?  Laughable, but I've got a good sense of humor.  I ordered the Angus Burger for ten bucks that came with house made pickles and choice of cheese.  I got the asparagus as my side.  My wife got the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with the fries.  Our son picked up the chicken fingers.  Ok, so lets get into it here.    I ordered the burger medium rare.  It came so well done you could have played street hockey for an hour with this thing.  The bun was a full INCH larger in diameter than the burger itself.  Where's the beef?!?!  Particularly for ten bucks?  I actually laughed with the expediter put the plate down in front of me.  He just walked away though- not asking me anything.  Maybe he had more important things to do.  The asparagus was the best thing I ate at Burntwood.  Order it if you go.    My wife described the chicken sandwich as boring.  So it's got bacon, cheese and honey mustard.  Who doesn't put that on a chicken sandwich these days.  It also has the same floppy, weird bun as the burger.  I tried it, I had to agree that it indeed was boring.  It reminded me of the Special K I eat every morning... I know I am eating something, but it's more for nourishment than an eating experience.  Boring is the perfect adjective.    The fries are pretty darn good though.  This chef has sides down cold- just has to work on the little details like the main part of the dish.  The chicken tenders were okay.  They were dry but at least weren't from a box.  The dipping sauce was just that, dipping sauce.  Nothing to write home about.    All told, our bill came to over $40 with the tip.  Let's recap: a shot glass of beer; an overdone, tiny burger; a boring chicken sandwich and just okay chicken tenders.  My sense of humor only extends so far.  I guess that I am just confused about this place.  They obviously dumped a ton of money into the joint and then forgot to find an ambitious chef.  How aggravating to go in with high expectations to find a blah menu and even worse: blah food.  Oh well, guess they wouldn't know how their customers respond either.  On the way out we were talking to the bartender and then he asked us how everything was.  We replied that it was just so-so.  He turned around and ignored us, like we didn't even say anything.    Meh, I've experienced a LOT better."}
{"text":"A good restaurant good ambiance I love the decorations. It is very pretty inside. I thought the food was good. Sweet potato fries were really yummy. We had the calamari and then I had a chicken Caesar salad it was goood. My husband wasn't too thrilled with the place he just thought it was ok. He has one of the specials he didn't really care for it. He does not want to go back. I would but I will probably end up going back with friends haha"}
{"text":"This is the best location it's also the original.  The ambiance is fantastic, it feels like a cozy ski lodge when you 1st roll in."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday night - service was wonderful.  Food very tasty.  BUT, there was a very average singer with her guitar \"entertaining\" and several times during her performance, it sounded like a wounded animal screaming for help.  I don't mean to sound catty, just was very difficult to hear each other speak - and we were at a table for four!  Outside of that, the food was VERY yummy and very affordable.  PLUS the Cleveland Indians were on the telly, and it was the LONG LONG game with a zillion innings - and we won.  It was fun to have everyone in the restaurant cheering.  Again - the service was outstanding.  Ask for \"WILL\" as your server!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing can't say enough about the Tater Tots - amazing delicious.  My sister and I both had the burger with pulled pork it was delicious everything in one bite salty, sweet, sour, Meaty.  This was my first visit but I will definitely go back.  The service was good our waitress made suggestions and she was very attentive.    The ambiance was comfortable and rustic love the wood floors and fireplaces."}
{"text":"First time here and it didn't disappoint!  I loved the vibe and look of the restaurant! We sat on the patio until the torrential downpour chased us inside!  My husband and I both had the fish and chips with jalapeno tartar sauce! DELICIOUS!!!!!  My son had a burger and it was very good as well.  I enjoyed the Moscow mule immensely. My husband enjoyed a bottle of Budweiser. (exciting I know) . Our server was awesome, attentive and quick.  When she heard we were celebrating my birthday she brought a champagne toast!  My son and i tried the desert menu as well.  The salted caramel ice cream was delicious!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Inflated prices for food equivalent to a fast food restaurant. Waitress was terrible."}
{"text":"Not the best food. Great atmosphere.  Service wasn't pleasant. We probably would go back for the bar and patio but not dinner."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the Burntwood Tavern. I read great reviews of the Chagrin location and read promising plans of the new spot in River. Big fans of The Pub, we checked it out for my friend's birthday. We got a table promptly. The beer and wine list was good and I ordered a milk stout. :) I was impressed with what  they had done to the interior with new lights, sleeker booths and exposed brick.   When we ordered our meals, I discovered they were out of salmon which incredibly limited my options as a pescetarian. There weren't many vegetarian options, but I'm sure they could veg something up. I subbed shrimp for salmon in my salad. It was a pile of spinach with six shrimp. It was good but not great. Everyone else enjoyed their food which included a burger, the blackened chicken wrap, and the excellent fish and chips.We were hoping to stay for drinks but our server and the restaurant seemed in a hurry to close. After waiting way too long for another drink, we decided to try somewhere else.  We decided to check it out again for Mother's Day. They were out of salmon...again. Our server didn't tell us this until we ordered which surprised me considering salmon is in at least 5 items on the menu.   Then they forgot our Cesar salad, the turkey wrap was lukewarm, and I think my sandwich was supposed to be on ciabatta bread. The service was friendly but slow and the food was just okay, so we Ieft disappointed again.  We could be going on off nights and I don't like writing not so great reviews. However, I really wanted to like Burntwood and left feeling less than impressed."}
{"text":"Waste of time, money & appetite. Probably worst dining experience I've ever had. Food is a joke & service was worse. My husband & I went for happy hour on Monday, more like comedy hour. We ordered the tuna nachos & tavern chips. Probably could've gotten better chips at the gas station & canned tuna would have complimented the wonton chips better than the under seasoned tuna they served us. To top it off, we waited well over a half an hour to get our meals. Mainly because we watched our server go to three other tables to take food orders directly after taking our food order. Been to two different Burntwoods and Won't be coming back and would urge all not to waste your time."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour apps.. all we ever go for great food great price... although we miss the angry chicken flatbread!!! Bring back the angry chicken hummus flat bread and it will be 5 stars again!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was is one of the better Burntwoods in my opinion.  View of the river is nice, especially in Ohio.  Service was great, food is always good. Drink options are much greater then speciality \"beer joint\".  We left once place we were having drinks at to eat here, great call!"}
{"text":"See these places popping up everywhere. Finally decided to try.  Apps are half price everyday from 3-5 or 6.  We tried the Tator tot bites come with three dips absolutely delicious. I order the angus burger well done with American cheese partner orders the club sandwich. Both entrees delicious.  Service was good but seemed slow getting main entrees.  Waitress was on top of water refills. Both entrees came with fries   Issues. No condiments offered or on table for burger so it came as advertised. Cheese tomato and lettuce.  Burger still good but would have preferred leaf lettuce instead of shredded.  Partners club was suppose to have a honey mustard on it.  It did not.    Those issues warrant a non five star."}
{"text":"Meh...horrible service with poor food. Pros: cute atmosphere, good bloody Mary bar, complimentary valet. Other than that, not a great experience. Recently went here for a birthday dinner with a party of 7. I had been before for a bridal shower, which was nice. Round 2 was not! We arrive around 5 pm on a Sunday. We realized it was happy hour (on a Sunday? Kind of weird, but whatever) so we decided to out in some orders for the half off appetizers and drinks. We initially ordered drinks and about 3 appetizers. Drinks arrive. We wait. Waited returns and since we were waiting for more people, decide to be nice and order 2-3 ,ore apps for them. Fast forward 45 minutes. No appetizers have arrived yet! (Keep in mind one it these was hummus - how long does it possible take to scoop hummus into a bowl?!). The weird part is that the server didn't once acknowledge the delay until we had to flag her down to ask. We probably saw her once in the span of 45 min. The place was not busy so not sure why there was a delay. Other guests arrive and a few decide to order entrees. 2 people order the flatbread, such was half ofg during happy hour. It's about 3 mins past 6pm (happy he ended at 6) and server had nerve to say \"sorry, happy hour Is over.\" Really?! You should probably  let the 3 minutes slide, since you've been MIA amd we've been waiting an hour for appetizers. So then our apoetizers all arrive at once. Ok fine. Flatbreads arrive...only they are more like nachos situated in a circle. Very weird. Flatbread should be similar to pizza, no? The cheese was so badly kept under heat lamps that it was almost non existent. One diner got a panini - yet it should have been called a wrap. It was wrapped in tortilla. Isn't that a wrap? 1 guest ordered no blue cheese on \"panini\" and got a side salad instead of the fries. Well what arrived at table? Yep, you guessed it...fries. Random server who dropped it off and after alerting him that she should have received the salad instead, he made a comment along the lines of \"hey, I just bring out what they give me.\" Server then comes by, we give her heads up that salad was not there. She comes back with a salad with blue cheese on it. The salad was not the one that was ordered AND Keep in mind that diner specifically asked for no blue cheese on the wrap, so why would she want blue cheese on the Salad?! Another diner sent back food (one Of The \"flatbreads\" by it looked so unappetizing).    She did start to refill water regularly, if that can be seen as a plus.  Just all around bad service. Server was so awkward and could have not cared less about the service. Sad because the horrible service and weird food took away from what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner with family. Not sure why this place sucked so bad. Management? Kitchen staff? Just don't go here. Not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Another visit that consisted of subpar food and mediocre service. The price point is too high for what you get. We won't be back.  The flatbread pizza and omelette were just simply not good. The server never even stopped to ask how the food was. The men's bathroom had a bad sewer gas odor. Trust the reviews you see for this chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! The food and drinks are amazing. My whole family loves the back patio."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this location, my first for lunch.  For a Tuesday it was packed! We were seated quickly, however...but then we waited quite a long time before we saw our server.  Eventually she came over and we placed our orders.  For lunch as well as dinner I've had the asiago crusted chicken.  It's delicious and this time was no different.  Service never really improved during our visit and our drinks were empty on more than one occasion.  I'll return...but hopefully we get a different server."}
{"text":"I feel like this place is trying to rely on the name to get established at this location. I've received better service at a TGIFridays. I understand this is a new location but I don't think anyone in this place that I dealt with tonight was trained on service.  The three different servers that came to my table were just as rude as each other. I felt like I was at Dicks Last Resort. The server made the assumption we were done with our food and took it off the table before we were finished.  Failed to even ask if we were finished or if she could take the plates. The last time I checked, if I still have food on my plate the chances are pretty good I'm not done with it.  The food was not comparable to anything else in Crocker Park and I don't mean that in a good way. The calamari was barely cooked and to top it off they serve it in a brown paper bag? The humus platter looked like it was put together by a line cook at McDonalds. Completely dissatisfied with the entire experience. I hate to bash the place but step your game up, especially at a higher end location.   To top it off they crammed a three piece band into a corner which eliminated at least a dozen chairs from the bar because of how loud they were. The music was good but not practical to say the least. I feel like management fumbled with this place and I would not return. Especially with the other options within walking distance. Only thing I could think of would be to send your staff (kitchen and servers) over to your Brecksville location for training. I've always had a pleasant experience over there.  Again, I hate to bash this hard but if you don't know then you can't fix it."}
{"text":"This place is great! Good service, great view, and great food!!! Awesome!! Bailey was an awesome server! The shrimp, tater tots, chicken sliders, and chips were yummy!"}
{"text":"Two colleagues and I tried Burntwood while we were in town for work. They do have free valet, but the parking lot is directly beside and behind the restaurant, so ... alright? Nice, I guess. They have a fantastic covered outdoor dining area, if a bit small. It was pouring rain and none of the tables got wet - so that's a plus.   Service was excellent, attentive and quick. It was a Tuesday; can't speak to the weekends. I have to say, the hummus was really delicious. Simple dish, but not every place can do it right. They do. And, oh boy, the cucumber pear cocktail? Order it. Fantastic. Not too sweet, and very fresh tasting.   Our server recommended the French Dip with prime rib, but, eh, it was okay. Just okay. I had order envy. I've had better, but it was my fault for not going with my gut and getting one of the yummy burgers. Fries are good, too :) I don't live in the area, but I'd go back if traveling for work there again!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back to the friendly tavern over the creek!!  Food and service were outstanding...."}
{"text":"Upscale décor, and except for the bean soup, our meal was delicious. The sweet potato fries were well cooked and fresh.  Salad was crispy and interesting.    We will return again, and there is a lot of competition for food in the Montrose area, but this restaurant is very good.  The manager came to our table to ask if everything was good and asked if we needed anything that our server didn't get for us.  I like the large amount of booths also."}
{"text":"We made reservations for 6 on a Saturday night to meet up there with some friends.  I show up 10 minutes before our reservation time.  I go to check in and they tell me that they are very busy, and we will have to be seated in the bar or patio.  When I remind them that we have a reservation, the hostess said \"Unfortunately whoever maid the reservation did not specify where you wanted to sit, and all we have available is the bar or patio\".  We sat on the patio, even though It was high-top tables with tall chairs.  There was a couple also waiting for a table that had a reservation for 45 minutes prior, and they decided to wait for a table.  As far as I am concerned, this pretty much defeats the purpose of a reservation.  Unless I were to request the patio / bar, I would definitely expect a table in the main dining area.  As for the food, it was OK.  The tavern tots came out burned. And my steak (ordered medium) was somewhere between rare and medium rare.  I used to enjoy this place, but after this experience I doubt I will ever go back"}
{"text":"Love going here for lunch, usually no wait at that time, much less crowded, and it's considerably more affordable. Also a great place to go for happy hour. During dinner time it can get a bit hectic and is usually pretty crowded. Nonetheless the food is always good with a couple standouts. The salmon salad is a personal favorite and they always do a spectacular job cooking the salmon perfectly. The burger is also a crowd favorite. And of course, you can't mention Burntwood without noting their very extensive Bloody Mary bar during brunch which I highly recommend for the fun alone."}
{"text":"While I appreciate the Burntwood restaurant locations, I was disappointed to discover that they don't have changing tables for kids in the bathrooms. I learned this when I took my two month old for a very badly needed diaper change. Worse yet, there were no flat surfaces to use, either. Thankfully, I had my mom with me to assist, and we utilized a short, rectangular wicker basket that was as long as my daughter, and stood about 1 foot high from the floor.   I soon located the manager, who informed me that I was one of at least one hundred who has raised this concern, she's told corporate, and none of their locations have them. She didn't share a corporate reason for any of this, and I was just baffled. This is a restaurant that carries a kid menu, provides crayons to kids, and offers kiddie cups! So it's not like they are trying to discourage young children- indeed, one of the reasons why my mom chose the Burntwood for her birthday celebration was because of the children's menu- we had three kids under 3 in our party.  When my two year old needed a diaper change, our wonderful server- and she was, in every way- showed me to a closet that some of the servers had turned into a makeshift changing area. Another server shared that she had seen a woman change a baby on the bathroom floor earlier that day, so there were others not as lucky as I.   Anyway, I'm stunned. For a cozy, casual, family oriented place not to consider parents of young children is really inconvenient. Once you are committed to a place, you are committed. And, as I told the manager, I probably won't be back- at least, not until my youngest is out of diapers.   As for the place- the service was excellent, and the food was good- not extraordinary, but solid.  My grilled walleye was a generous portion, and it had a decent amount of flavor. The asparagus was sparse and a little charred, but the red skinned potatoes- partially smashed- were very good.  Ultimately, we had a great time, but I just had to get a bit creative when caring for my children.  UPDATE: I wrote Burntwood this morning, and received an email from the GM tonight- on Christmas Eve- apologizing and letting me know that they will install a changing table. Wow- I am impressed. I raised them a star. They have a varied childrens' menu and my daughter loved the mac and cheese with fries. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love burnt wood tavern, especially the one on the river has such a cool atmosphere. My favorite thing in the menu is the had browns, they are different than you would expect but oh so good! The sandwiches are really good too!"}
{"text":"If there was a 3.5 star option that's what this place would be. They have happy hour 7 days a week from 3-6 that features half priced apps and flatbreads, $3 beers, $4 wines and $5 cocktails. I absolutely love the chicken sliders, they are out of this world! The tater tots aren't tradition and are larger (more hush puppy looking) but they are great as well! The place looks great and they have a nice patio. My issue is with the cleanliness... On any given day you'll be swarmed by fruit flies, to the point that it's annoying. Service isn't the best, but not the worst either. The prices are just right for happy hour but a bit pricey other times. Definitely check it out once!"}
{"text":"I've lived less than a mile from Burntwood Tavern for over 2 years and hadn't tried it until about a week ago. Needless to say I'm absolutely kicking myself that I didn't try it sooner!  The restaurant is located near the Lakewood-Rocky River border and features a large bar and patio. What really separates this place from all the other eateries in the area is the ridiculously awesome happy hour. The deals are from 3-6pm everyday (including weekends) and features half off apps, flatbreads and cheap drinks ($3 beers, $4 wines, $5 cocktails). I've tried the tater tots and the chicken sliders and both are out of this world good. The tots are more like hush puppies and come with a dipping sauce. The sliders feature crispy chicken, a hot sauce and a pickle. The heat of the hot sauce coupled with the sweetness of the pickle really take this to another level.   Great place for a date, family night out, or happy hour spot!"}
{"text":"Great decor and very swanky but agree with someone else about the noise. I've been there twice and sat in the back and in the covered patio and both had the same deafening noise level.   the beer selection is great and the service was also very good. This however did not make up for the lackluster food. on the first trip we had the porkchops and walleye. The chops were very dry and tasteless and while the walleye was ok, it was very small and the potatoes it came with were so overcooked they were inedible.  on the second trip, we went with a group of 7 and 4 of the 7 had issues with their meals. my chicken philly sandwich was a safe play and while very tasty, the sandwich was tiny and left me wanting more. someone else in the group ordered the walleye this time and it was riddled with bones. the pumpkin ravioli was undercooked, the salmon blt wrap was bland. I want to like this place because it seems like a great addition to the neighborhood. The waitress was quick to try and remedy the issues we had with those that spoke up.  also, the covered patio was using outdoor heaters and it literally felt like a sauna. most of us were very uncomfortable until they turned off only to come back on about 20 min later. brutal.   I hope they figure out the food. I will give them another chance but probably not for at least a few more weeks when hopefully they figure out these issues."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such bad reviews. I live and work near Burntwood and we go there all the time. My favorite is the Asiago Crusted Chicken I get that almost every time. The apps are also great. They infuse their own vodka and the jack and jill is my favorite drink."}
{"text":"Nice place with good food and service but my experience was not exactly what I expected.... I met a girl for a casual first date after work in the bar area of this location not too long ago; my first time there. The bar is VERY photogenic, by the way. Exposed brick/stone with a great open view of the river due to all the windows. Very warm feeling, I loved it. My date and I didn't go into the restaurant area itself but it too looked lovely and I would like to return sometime to get that side of the experience as well. That said, what I didn't expect was how crowded and loud it was for sporting such a cozy appearance. For the first 10 minutes we were there, it was standing room only. I was also put off by the random live musician that appeared later on... The bar is simply too small for it. To his credit, he wasn't half bad as a singer and we liked his song list but it was far too loud. My date and I were yelling trying to speak to one another. It was really just bizarre. The atmosphere of this place didn't strike me as \"we have live bands dropping in to drown out the ambiance of the evening\" at all, especially with how quiet and intimate the actual restaurant area appeared to be. I was displeased with that aspect of the evening to state the obvious, but other than that the bartenders were very nice and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"This is the worst location of all of the other burntwoods. The food is uninspired. The staff is very friendly hence the two star rating. That's the best they offer. I've given them three tries and they screwed up each time. The attempts to right things by Nick the \"manager\" were laughable at best. Save some money and go to McDonald's"}
{"text":"Good service, great drinks. Well priced. Highly recommended! The staff here is very knowledgeable and friendly. Caitlin really made sure we got taken care of."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service. I will definitely be back. The catch of the day (red snapper) was better than could've been expected and the prime rib chili was delectable."}
{"text":"AMAZZINGGG BEER SELECTIONS and good Dessert :D   The atmosphere was warm and cozy-reminiscent of a hunting/skiing lodge.  Plenty of wood work and wrought iron design integration with relatively neutral colors.  They have a large bar that accommodate at least 15-20 people?  The restaurant is slightly divided by the bar, one side- they have an enclosed seasonal area with fireplace with couches, tables, and tvs for dining.  The other side of the restaurants has more booths.  I absolutely loved the cozy atmosphere of the enclosed area: watched the football game and was kept nice and warm by the fire.  The coffee table was a bit low for the couch we were eating at.    I tried a seasonal brew Southern Tier- Pum-King and that was absolutely delicious.  It had nice heaviness to the ale with hint of Pumpkin Pie spices.    For appetizers, I got their Tuna Nachos.  The Wonton Chips were nice, crispy, and warm.  I liked the flavors of the onions, cilantro cream drizzle, tomatoes, and scallions.  However, the tuna should speak for itself and it was not the star of the appetizer.  I couldn't taste the tuna in the plethora of flavors.  Additionally, it seems as if they skimped a bit on the tuna- as the toppings to chips were slightly off.    For dinner: I shared the smoked pork chops and rack of lamb.    The smoked pork chops were delicious with the sweet potato fries and the peach-jalapeno preserves.  The smoked pork chops had a heavy mesquite flavoring and the sweet preserves were perfect to balance out the heavy smokiness.  The preserves had a slight hint of spiciness, but it was more sweet and peachy than spicy.  The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy, but similar to any other sweet potato fry.     I was a bit disappointed with the rack of lamb.  The lamb was undercooked when it first came to me, so I had to send it back to finish cooking.  The lamb was cooked well when it came back, but it was somewhat gamey in flavor.  The gameness was disappointing, although it is hard to eliminate the gameness in lamb.  The root vegetables served with the lamb were delicious- well seasoned and savory- it hit the carb spot wonderfully.      Dessert: Burntwood Tavern Ice Cream Sandwich.  I loved their chocoalte waffle that sandwiched the ice cream.  The chocolate waffle was soo soo good.  It heavy on the chocolate flavor without excess sweetness.  I loved their ice cream with small pieces of raspberries randomly mixed into the chocolate ice cream.  It is sweet, but not overwhelmingly sweet.  My only complaint is that the waffle was soggy from the ice cream melting, I'll just ask them to put the waffle pieces on the side next time.    The service was accommodating and the managers came by to check on dinner, without being too attentive.  As stated above, they have an AMAZING BEER SELECTION and a relatively good wine selection as well.  I want to go back and try their mixed drinks soon and more appetizers and desserts!!"}
{"text":"I ordered salmon kids meal for my daughter, I got the adult and they were the same size.  Mine was 21 hers was 6.  The manager says so are you upset that hers was too big or yours was too small.  REALLY! Then he says they take a loss on the kids meal, I'm not interested in that because you clearly make up for it by charging 21 for the same size meal.  Very poor service had to go to bar and get more water.  Will never be back."}
{"text":"So, I heard that the Burntwood in Rocky River was a chain place, and that struck me as odd, because the place has some unique style. My wife and I stopped by on the recommendation of a co-worker, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.   The ambiance of the place is woody, dark and comfy, a place that you can take someone to for a first date or you spouse out to have a drink and a snack and both will feel relaxed and enjoyable. They have a very generous and creative drink menu, and the food we had was good.  We came just at their \"happy hour\" which was from about 4 to 6, during which certain beers and small plates were half-off, so we indulged. They make some killer wings and sauces, some interesting shrimp tacos and other tasty treats. (BTW, I heartily recommend the happy hour, just to get a good and well-priced overview of what they have:)   Now, they are a bit pricey in the normal time frame, but if you want to impress, it's a place to take people to talk, nosh and relax. We also had great service and the manager even stopped by to make some recommendations.   I was very pleased by the experience, and I didn't feel like I got burnt in the Burntwood:)"}
{"text":"This is our first time here and I'm  not impressed. The host was rude and acted like we were a hassle to seat. I had the dip sandwich with fries, the bread was burnt. The \"prime rib\" was tough, and barely any dip. They were very stingy with condiments and a lot of things were burnt. The server was very nice. The prices are a little high for the quality. Also they sat us by a door and the servers kept going out of it to smoke  and leaving it cracked in freezing weather making us and our food cold. I just expected so much more from a nice looking place like this."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. Here from out of town and it exceeded my expectations. They have a Bloody Mary bar didn't get to try it but looks amazing. If you are in the area you definitely need to stop by."}
{"text":"We have eaten ther 4 times and it is consistently good. Going tomorrow with out of town guests and excited to share our experience with them."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Burntwood Tavern three times. All were private parties. The atmosphere is beautiful. The food and service are fair. They were accommodating for people with dietary needs/restrictions. However not easily handicapped accessible. I wouldn't go out of my way to dine there."}
{"text":"Our waiter was very accommodating as one ordered hamburg and fries and the other ordered the salmon salad. We share and he was so nice to split the salmon salad, hamburg & fries for us in the kitchen. It was a very good angus burger, grilled just the way we ordered. Salmon salad was very good too. Those unhealthy fries were delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious food, lovely atmosphere, the HH drink I ordered was quite strong. The free pretzel bread sticks were delicious and the Tater Tots with the cheese sauce were excellent. My steak salad was perfectly cooked to my MR request and the small deserts were just the right size!"}
{"text":"The best part of this place is the atmosphere! Drinks are delicious! Food is good not great but it makes for a fun night out !"}
{"text":"the food isn't bad, but if you're hungry, then I suggest you avoid this place because the portions are so small, which is surprising because the prices are not reasonable at all for the quantity of food you get. I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries and was still hungry afterwards and I've never seen such small salads in my life, which is what three others at our table got and they were not inexpensive. Overall, a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Corporate corporate corporate terrible the shrimp are not as advertised they are buffalo shrimp not firecracker shrimp pizza taste like it came out of a cardboard box with pickled jalapeños it has no flavor terrible"}
{"text":"Burntwood has very good food and a great happy hour, if you can make it early enough. I never went to the previous restaurant in this location, but love how they have it set up. The history and location right on the river are nice. This restaurant and Rosewood in Hudson are my go to places when we can't decide what we want."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere as always, but stay away from the jambalaya special. I told the waitress (and asked her to share with the chef) that \"this was the most unimpressive jambalaya I've ever had.\" The shrimp were the smallest I've ever seen, the pieces of meat (chicken and andouille) were few and far between, and the flavor was bland. For $20 I expected a large portion, and got what I would consider to be a lunch-sized serving.   When I asked the waitress to share my feedback, she even mentioned having relatives in Louisiana, and the fact that she'd eaten a fair amount of jambalaya in her life.  And she was not impressed by this version, any more than I was.   In the end, it was a Mardi Gras special, and hopefully it won't make the permanent menu. As usual, Burntwood is a good place to have a drink and an app, but the food was overpriced, as always. Service was better than in the past, however."}
{"text":"Great experience for lunch today! We shared the Tavern Tater Tots for $9 (tomato aioli, chipotle BBQ, & peppercorn ranch dips), along with a glass of their house Cabernet. I decided on the Chicken Parmesan sandwich for $11 (breaded chicken with mozzarella, arugula, & pomodora) served with fries. The portions were very large, so I ended up bringing home half of my sandwich."}
{"text":"My man and I needed to re-fuel from our crazy day of shopping at the West Side Market and Trader Joe's.  Why not the Burntwood Tavern?  I've wanted to try this place for ages.    We were boisterously welcomed by who I eventually deduced was the Service Manager.  Our Bartender Mark was nice and not overly chatty; a welcomed change from the usual chit-chatty bartender.  I was excited to see some CO brews on tap and chose the Flying Dog Old Scratch.  Das Mann liked it so he had one too.  For lunch I chose the \"Pick Two\" and had a nice house salad and their California Chix Sandwich.  The chicken was perfectly prepared...nice and flavorful and not dry!  I loved the sprouts on the sandwich; not too many places in CLE have sprouts.  Only thing I would have added was a nice brown mustard, but hey...that's a personal thing.  Das Mann got a Reuben w/ the house fries.  While it wasn't true to the Reuben recipe...it was DELISH.  The fries weren't bad.  Burntwood offered a nice variety of side options.  I chose to try their sweet potato fries...I mean, how can I not try every place's sweet potato fries?  Eh....these weren't the best I've ever had, but overall everything else was pretty tasty.  While we were driving to our destination the man was checkin' out the reviews on his fancy new iPhone from Yelp.  The overall consensus was that this place was great w/ good food, and reasonable prices.  I've got to say, I was impressed w/ the food, the prices....not so much?  They're not uber-reasonable; while not terribly overpriced, I didn't feel the price-point was fabulous.  (My selections was $10 about $2 higher than I think it was worth.)  When I asked our super bartender about whether or not I'd get a warm brownie if I ordered a mimosa he gave me a confused look.  Apparently the man read a review on Yelp that said some chick got a warm brownie w/ her mimosa.  Looking back at the reviews now, I don't see this.  I have no idea what the man was reading or if he was just makin' crap up, but regardless the bartender calls the \"Host / Manager\" over.  I tell him my question and he says I can have a warm brownie if I want, but no, they don't come w/ a mimosa.  As we're getting ready to walk out the door, low and behold...the dude walks over w/ a warm brownie and two spoons!  You're kidding, right!? :)   The brownie was HOT and gooey, and so so yummy!!!!  And, yeah, I'm sold.  (Read: Give a girl chocolate and you've got her business for life)  So here's the verdict: Atmosphere: Good, could be super cozy w/ the fire going Service: Rocking....thank you for having good service Food:  Good, fast, and while slightly more expensive for certain items, the taste was worth it  I'd recommend it.  Check the Burntwood out...I don't think you'll be sorry."}
{"text":"Location and decor are the two big pluses here - reserve a river view table a few days before you go. Valet parking is easy to use and they are friendly. Great atmosphere diminished by mediocre staff and declining food quality. When it opened food was top notch - it's still OK, but not great. Drinks are often overly boozy and I'd avoid special days like Mothers Day as they haven't figured out buffet style serving.   But the views are great and the outdoor space at night features some fire pit groupings that would be great for beers and appetizers."}
{"text":"Nice place, good music, the bar is my favourite spot. Good selections of wines and food. Nice cosy laid back atmosphere.  Everyone was very nice. Special thanks to Chelsea and Jim. Would highly recommend this place.  Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"Amazing place .Enjoyed the bar scene. Atmosphere was very nice and luved the bar. The live music added to the ambience. Enjoyed dancing while having the best selections of wine and desserts . Renee was simply amazing and made sure we were all having a great time.Special thanks to Dan for taking great care of me and my guests  Would definately come back. Highly recommend this place.  Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"Took my mom out here for her birthday the service food and the enviorment was excellent. I paid 18 l bucks for a fish dinner at the time it felt like I ate a 50 dollar meal. I was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Very friendly people great variety on menu food was fresh an really good can't wait to come back. Thanks for the great service"}
{"text":"Went on Tuesday, met some friends and had a really excellent meal, crowded but we enjoyed our meal and the company."}
{"text":"My husband and I caught an early dinner tonight at Burntwood. Service was excellent, Katie, our waitress was great. Happy Hour specials included half price apps, so we started with pot stickers and blackened shrimp tacos. Pot stickers wrap was very thick, and the filling had a weird, unpleasant flavor. Shrimp tacos were excellent, and our waitress offered to put the aioli on the side when we inquired about spice level. She also removed the pot stickers from our bill just because she noticed we hadn't eaten them, even though we didn't mention anything. I had the chicken Madeira, the sauce was great, but the \"crispy potatoes\" (baked potatoes squashed flat and then deep fried) had no seasoning, and we're very boring. I had to request salt and pepper to salvage them. Husband had the catch of the day, artic char, with \"lemon\" buerre blanc, which was very bland. Paired with the crispy potatoes, and underseasoned veg, his dish was pretty disappointing. Oh, and FYI, the house salad is mostly arugula, with goat cheese, tomatoes, and red onions, not exactly what I was expecting, and not everyone's (ie my husband's) cup of tea. Don't think we'll be back, the 3rd star in this review is for Katie, she was awesome."}
{"text":"Burntwood Tavern in Chagrin Falls might be one of the coziest restaurants I've ever experienced. When you enter the restaurant, you're greeted by a well-stocked bar in an environment that strikes me as upscale après-ski. They have an extensive and creative drink menu that I couldn't help but order from.  For my meal, I ended up being a bit traditional and had a chopped salad and steak and fries. The salad was very generous for $5 and the dressing was fantastic. The Tavern Steak and Fries was also had very generous portions and really hit the spot. I like my steak medium-well and I think they maybe tried to cook it too quickly, as it was a bit dry. However, the flavor definitely made up for it.   And speaking of generous portions, I had to pass on dessert. They all looked amazing and the rest of my group had lots of positive feedback.   Our server was great- very attentive and really upbeat. Most of the other patrons were regulars who invited us to come back again - and I just might!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent spot. I don't drink but they had a huge selection of wine and beer. We went for lunch and a lot of the items were half off for happy hour which was cool. The waitress was super nice and helpful and gave us a vip card at the end to get points for free food. The burgers were pretty damn good, super tender and fresh. The fries were ok, super salty. Service was fast. Recommended."}
{"text":"Great brunch menu with a fantastic Bloody Mary bar that features several infused vodka selections. The decor and ambiance of the bar is amazing and the bartenders are super nice.   We came back twice in one weekend for drinks just for the friendly atmosphere. It's an affordable place where you feel at home and the bartenders ask your name when you sit gown to get to know you better. We will be back when we come into town."}
{"text":"Attended this place 3 times and every time the service has been awesome! Food taste great and creative drinks! They have a great happy hour 7 days a week 3-6pm which includes 1/2priced apps, $5 house cocktails, $4 wines & $3 bottled beers!  Best thing about this place is definitely the ambiance! Outside seating is amazing because it looks over the Cuyahoga River! A must go in CF!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  They did an amazing job with this building!  The staff seems well trained and the food is good.  Not great.  The margarita pizza seems like it came out of a box...frozen.   Make a fresh crust, brush it with some olive oil, throw some tomatoes and fresh mozz on it and serve it hot and crispy.   The salmon is good, the zucchini strips and addictive.    I would avoid going on Thursday nights... the live music made me want to kill myself.  Toooooo loud and not good!  Couldn't talk over the music... which I believe was singing over a sound track.   I think the patio will be fab this summer."}
{"text":"We are sitting here an hour and 15 after we got sat and still haven't received our food. At the hour mark we made a complaint and they told us that the kitchen is \"slow.\" It's Father's Day and they didn't anticipate a busy day? The manager promised to comp us and refill our drinks then disappeared. This is literally the worst service I've ever seen. I can't believe the good reviews that this place gets. Probably a bad day but we've seen the server and manager exactly two times in over an hour.  Update...food finally arrived 90 minutes after we ordered. In fairness, the food was good enough to give them another try. But good grief what lousy service.  Fair is fair. The day following my review post the GM of this restaurant contacted me and asked for my email, then personally apologized. Apparently the restaurant had some impactful personnel issues and this was an unusual occurrence. I did mention the lack of service and he apologized for that as well and said he would address that at a staff meeting he planned for that day.  He asked for my address then, two days later, I received a handwritten letter and a gift card with a request that we give them another try.  To me that shows a real concern and a lot of professionalism on their part. And class. Food is food but when a business goes the distance like this to show that they value you as a customer, they deserve a second chance. In my book. Today we tried again and it couldn't have gone better. It was like it was a totally different restaurant. Hopefully the Father's Day incident was just a blip, and I'm sure we will return again."}
{"text":"This was the first time ever eating at Burntwood Tavern. It was delightful. We were quickly seated and had a very friendly and attentive waitress, Rhonda. We ordered drinks, Citrus and Cucumber. They were delicious. We ordered the tater tots and those were really good as well. The chicken flatbread with avocado is a must try! So good! The atmosphere was cozy, warm, and elegant. I really enjoyed my dining experience here and would recommend this place to anyone. We will definitely be back! Ask for Rhonda's section; she was amazing!"}
{"text":"I dined at the Solon location last year and this year we tried Chagrin. I will not be back...nope, not ever to any Burntwood Tavern. Food was gross at both locations. I wish I would have taken a picture of my \"veggie burger.\"  It was not a patty but instead, smashed up, lukewarm mush. I really don't know how this restaurant isn't embarrassed to serve something like that. My family had beef burgers and the fish and chips and said they were average at best. 2 super small margaritas for $18.00. Service was friendly but SLOW. Price: outrageous. 2 burgers, 1 veggie mush and 1 fish and chips with 2 small margaritas......$85.00. Save your money or dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"The host was terrible - had such a bad attitude. However, Colin - our server, totally made up for the initial bad taste in my mouth. He was excellent. We enjoyed our time sitting outside on the amazing patio. The salad and sandwich were good. The flatbread was not great but not terrible. We'll definitely come back for happy hour but hope to be greeted by someone with a warm smile and not a shitty attitude."}
{"text":"Best appetizers in Cleveland . Shrimp tacos are best I've had anywhere. Keep trying other places and they don't compare. Phenomenal wait staff , great atmosphere. 3 season patio with heaters is really nice"}
{"text":"Went yesterday for lunch. Served kids spoiled milk- when we told the waiter, he wasn't really surprised. Food was average, nothing special."}
{"text":"Very nice trendy place, Most of our party enjoyed the food, I did not because what I order seem like it was smoked too much which I don't care for. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"The Wednesday half price drinks and appetizers are the best deal in town. I have sampled all of the appetizers and they have not disappointed. The calamari was some of the best I have had. Lightly breaded and very tender. I have not ordered an entrée. The wait staff has always been courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place driving into Chagrin Falls looking for a tasty dinner on a Sunday night. We ended up getting to The Falls and found hardly anything open for dinner so we headed back to the interesting looking Burntwood Tavern. The exterior is somewhat unassuming yet cute and quaint looking from the street. Upon walking in, we were very surprised to see how unique and interesting the interior is, think rustic house in some swanky mountain town with wood beams, wood floors and of course the requisite stone fire place. The host was very gracious and showed us to a table in the back dining room. He explained to us how they renovated the building using much of the wood that was reclaimed from barns in the area. The ambiance was nice and rustic without feeling overly cabin-esque.   My friend and I ordered drinks, I chose the Tavern Mojito with a flavored rum which I actually ended up exchanging for a classic mojito as the fruit flavor was super over-powering. For appetizers, we settled on the gazpacho and the fish sticks, both were delicious. The gazpacho was chunky, fresh and flavorful with the perfect amount of seasoning, it was topped with creme fraiche and crab meat. The fish sticks were crispy, light and perfectly friend and served with a jalapeno tarter sauce. My entree fell a little short in terms of expectations, I ordered the french dip and had envisions of a crusty, toasted roll stuffed with prime rib and melty cheese but sadly the dish was what what I had envisioned. The roll wasn't toasted and the prime was was just ok but the sweet potato fries that came with it were delish!   As mentioned above, the host was very warm and welcoming and our server was about average.   Next time you are in Chagrin Falls, give this unique tavern a try!"}
{"text":"The food and service are good. I had the Angus Burger and it was really good. The Kettle Chips appetizer with the Gorgonzola sauce was tasty!  Love the look and feel of the bar. Burntwood Tavern has a rustic and welcoming ambiance to hang out. My first impression was that it has a laid back and easy going feel to it.  Great place to be sitting with the doors and windows open on a warm summer night in Rocky River."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance, and the smell of wood burning fireplace. I love how close to the office this is located. I love love love the steak salad with rare steak, that they cook perfectly. I love most of the servers, as they have been mostly wonderful.  I detest that it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to have a lunch in an HOUR. For cripes sake people, you put a restaurant in the middle of a bunch of office buildings...Ya gotta assume people need to get in and out in a reasonable time frame.  They come to the table, and explain the specials, and take beverage orders. They return a while later with beverages. If you are lucky, your order is taken. Then, I believe they go to another location in another city to obtain the food.   When you are done eating, perhaps your server will come to get plates. The checks are apparently printed in yet another location that requires them to hike long distance to get to.  Turn over your method of payment if you dare.  The checks are calculated using near sighted monks in a remote mountain town.   I've never had a lunch take less than 1.5 hours, up to 2 hours.   However. I have started ordering my steak salad to be picked up, and it is heavenly. Good food, nice servers, but slow as hell service.   Be aware."}
{"text":"Tried to go here with my family on 12/26/15 before seeing a movie down the street. We called ahead to see if they were busy and if we could reserve a table. We were told the next opening was at 6:30 and that, yes, that would give us time to get to our 7:40 movie. The hostess requested our name and we were on our way.  We arrived at 6:20 to be told that they do not take reservations, but we could wait an hour for their next table. Assuming that we had spoken to someone else on the phone we explained our confusion. However, the hostess asserted, now with an air of hostility, that she had taken our call and that we were mistaken: we had not, she informed us, made a reservation. Then, rather than apologizing for the miscommunication, she brought over someone else, also young (maybe they were afraid of getting in trouble?) who told us quite rudely that we could wait an hour for a table or leave.  Well, even if we had an hour to kill who would wait around for service like that? Not us. We went two doors down to Hunan by the Falls and had delicious Pad Thai."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Burntwood a bunch of times and tonight was very disappointing.  Our waitress forgot our appetizer,  then brought it out after our entrees arrived.  I ordered short ribs, the first round of which were inedible. Oh, and NOT short ribs.  The second round was better, but again, NOT short ribs.  Not a good son when a restaurant tries to pass pot roast off for something different.  Very disappointed, will not be back."}
{"text":"I went to this place opening weekend during Oktoberfest in the Falls. You were supposed to have reservations for this special weekend, but they let us in and we were able to get a table on their deck, over looking the river! It was really pretty.   All the food was half priced for the opening. I went back once again a few weeks ago with some co workers and the service was great each time.  They have a good beer selection and I kind of like that they have valet.  Both times I ordered the veggie burger. It's probably the largest veggie burger I've ever had, but it's definitely hand made and very flavorful. I would say it's runner up to my fav veg burger out there right now.  With drinks, apps, and entree between 3 people, we spent $100+"}
{"text":"Bartender too busy doing prep work than serving drinks and taking orders. Management scared to death to engage a customer or make an attempt at solving a problem. Everything is overpriced and parking is horrible. Food is average. I won't be going back. Ever."}
{"text":"So while I was visiting on work my boss and co workers came here and it was an ok experience. I had the filet and it was good but I am not 100% sure that it deserved such a high price. The appetizers were calamari and another dish that I forget but remember being quite good. Overall I would suggest this place again but the service was really slow even though we caught them right before the kitchen closed we should have had better service. Servers you could tell were not happy to serve us even though we were a huge table and was just goi to be more money for them. If the service was better would have got better review. But again would go back for food that is a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"We've been to this Burntwood location a couple of times and the good is good as well as the service. We love the happy hour!  Lots of drink specials and half off the appetizers from 4 pm until 6 pm. Last time we had the shrimp tacos, beef sliders and tavern chips -- plenty of food for two!  My husband had a beer and I had a \"pour mule,\" a Moscow mule with berry flavored vodka and muddled berries. Very good!"}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant as a meeting place for our family, traveling from different parts of the state, for a Sunday afternoon lunch.  The food was fresh and delicious and the staff very friendly.  We will definitely keep this place in mind for future meet-ups!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday with a group of friends.  We like to frequent local \"Happy Hours\".  They provide a less crowded, cheaper option to our \"girls night\" outtings.  What's especially nice is that Burntwood has a daily happy hour from 3-6.  Which means weekends!  That's awesome!    The Rocky River BT was easy to find, ample parking and friendly staff.  Our waiter was attentive and inviting.  He was knowledgeable about the menu and drinks offered.    I was quite impressed by the happy hour offerings.  All appetizers were 1/2 off.  ($3-$6 each)  as were the flatbreads ($5-6)  The drink menu was really different.  Not you usual beer and wine offerings.  ($5-6)  We each ordered several food options and drinks.  None of us went away hungry and we spent less than $25 each and that included two drinks.    I highly recommend the Luxardo Manhatten made with Old Forester, sweet vermouth  and luxardo cherry juice and also the Razzberry-Orange Crush made with Infused orange vodka, muddled razzberries, triple sec, simple syrup and orange juice.  We pretty much shared all the plates we ordered.  They give nice large portions for appetizers.  Enough to serve 2-4 people easily.     What I loved:  Artichoke, Roasted Garlic & Tasso Fondue bubbling hot with pita chips & tortilla chips.  They also have a really big and tasty House Salad fro ($5)   What I didn't like:  The Pumpkin Ravioli were tasty but more for desert.  They tasted like pumpkin pie.  Very sweet.  It was a large plate big enough to share because 1 or 2 ravioli was enough.  Honestly I probably wouldn't order them again, although my friend absolutely loved them.  I also did not like the BBQ Flatbread.  It just didn't work for me.  It was dry and the bbq sauce did not mix well with the pickled onion.    Overall this is a GREAT Happy Hour.  We will definitely make this one of our \"go to\" places.    I'd also like to try the main menu but it is rather pricey.  So I'll save that for a \"Date Nite\" :)  or special occassion."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and a great outdoor area when it's nice out! Their Moscow mules are to die for but their salads are a little small! Try their potato balls---I can't remember what they are called but OH MY GOD. They're amazing."}
{"text":"Service was above average. Atmosphere was lively and fun. Food was good but a bit pricey for what it was. If there were half stars I would probably gone with 3.5.   Bar seemed to be busy during happy hour with a good band playing. A lot of fun being had."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Service is awful, food is over priced and not good quality. Orders a conways and got an IPA but they told us it was conways. Will never go back. I don't understand how people like this place"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, attentive and friendly service. Beautiful decor. The food is amazing. The tuna nachos made with sashimi were out of this world. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Patio was really nice.  I was surprised by the lack of beer selection they had.  I guess I expected more.  Lots of beers, just not good ones."}
{"text":"Food and scenery was beautiful. Service was terrible waitress disappeared twice required help from another server after me and my date had already waited 17 minutes to get our order taken. The second time the waitress came back she smelled of pot and perfume.... Food was great though even had V.I.P stools at the bar!!"}
{"text":"I came here with co-workers for lunch on a Monday. Service was standard, menu is standard for tavern food, but the ambiance is super cool! They really hit all the details going for the Deadwood look, and it was pretty bustling, so I enjoyed the experience.   The bar area features some cool, rustic decor, but the vaulted ceiling is what really makes the space. If I lived nearby, I would come to the bar regularly. I can't speak to the bar service, but it certainly looks like a cool spot to hang out.  The menu is not amazing, but my burger was cooked remarkably true to the medium rare I ordered. It is a rare (no pun intended) thing to actually get your burger cooked just so; you will appreciate it.  I'd like to bring my wife back here, or some friends from out of town looking for a cool space. 4 or 5 stars would require outstanding service, slightly lower prices, and a little more polished table presentation (Heinz bottles take away from the saloon ambiance). I won't come out of my way to return, but if we're here again, it's not a bad choice.  Check it out; I think you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Just got back from a lovely dinner at this place, which was recommended by our customer here in town. We really enjoyed everything about the experience (though prior to going, I was very surprised by the LACK of reviews focused on the food, and slightly worried we had made a bad choice.)  We arrived right around 6 pm. Parking lot was very full, but we found a spot and walked around the front, which faces Market street. We walked in, were immediately greeted by a hostess and were also seated immediately - no wait at all, despite the fact that the place was packed. It was very loud inside and full of an eclectic mix of diners: groups of ladies, groups of business people, couples of all ages, families with small kids, family groups celebrating what appeared to be birthdays, etc. People were dressed from very casual (jeans and tshirts) to business suits to night-out dresses and heels.   We were seated in a booth in the dining room farthest from the bar and served by a bubbly waitress named Marissa. She was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and engaging. She told us how this place is one of 11 locations in OH, how it was started in 2010, and how she was a regular customer for years before becoming a server, which she did because she loved the place. You could see why - despite the noise level, the decor, ambiance and food are all great.  I ordered a glass of Malbec and two appetizers for dinner: blackened shrimp tacos and zucchini frites. The tacos came three to a plate, and each was about 3-inches in diameter (flour tortillas), filled with tasty, small blackened shrimp. There was some kind of lettuce or slaw in them, along with some tangy sauce. On the side was a small wedge of lime, a small container of pickled red onion, and 4 tortilla chips with a scoop of guacamole. Yummy. The zucchini frites were tasty but a tiny bit disappointing: the zukes were almost shoe-string cut, and seemed either under cooked or too thin/small to stand up to the batter because they were limp and kind of soggy when you picked them up. Better eaten with a fork than by hand (which was the experience I was hoping for). They tasted great though and were seasoned well, and served with two dipping sauces - a ranch and a yummy tomato-y dip. Not sure I would get this again, buy maybe to share.  My co-worker had the Burntwood burger, which was kind of like a burger and breakfast sandwich melded together - it had an egg, hashbrown patty and bacon, plus lettuce, tomato and sweet (not dill) pickles. It was huge, and cooked to order (which my co-worker ordered as medium rare and that's how it was served). It came with a side of fresh-cut fries which were perfect (delicious, crisp, decadent) and served in a paper bag. The presentation was very nice.  For dessert, we each had a different 'mini dessert' - they had 5 offerings, each served in a mini beer-mug shaped glass. I had the warm chocolate brownie served with local raspberry chocolate chunk ice cream; my co-worker had the red velvet cake with whipped topping. They were the perfect size and at $2.95 each, I would highly recommend saving room and getting one to top off your meal.  Overall, a very solid, tasty meal and an enjoyable place. We will return and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and weird- bartender slapped down the drink menus and didn't greet us. When he came back minutes later he slapped down two coasters and just looked at us at which point I said \"hi\" are you taking our order? Service was slow after that... food was tasty but after the meal I went to the bathroom and slipped right near steps. I happened to see a manager so told him and he said ok we will look into it- and he proceeded to talk to guests at the bar. Just overall seemed like no one working at this restaurant cared about anyone and I have no desire or reason to go back with so many other great choices close by."}
{"text":"Great service, poor food quality.  I had the Fried Chicken Special ... green beans were under cooked and tough, while the mashed potatoes were lumpy.  My wife had the Ceaser Salad that used powdered Parmesan cheese (normally used with spaghetti), not shaved ... it ruined the texture and taste.  Delivery of food to table was sporadic... last person got their meal almost 10 minutes after the first entree arrived.  We liked this restaurant in the beginning, but this is the second disappointing experience in the last month.  We will not return."}
{"text":"The food is great, staff are great, and the atmosphere is awesome. The food is very filling and is all made with natural ingredients. This is one of the only omelette S I have had not from an egg mix. There is a little bit of a wait, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"We brought my brother from California here on a Saturday night for Happy Hour! Great ambience, half priced apps, $4 house wine and $3 bottled beer   And $5 specialty drinks! We ordered about 6 appetizers and flatbread pizzas between the five of us plus house and wedge salads! Plenty of left overs. Pizza was great! Shrimp tacos, delicious! Seasoned fries are yummy! Katie gave us great service with a sunny disposition. I recommend it for Happy Hour for sure - we will be back!"}
{"text":"Thirst off I'm glad this meal was free(as an employee appreciation). I ordered a chicken salad , the salad had hardly any beans and tortilla strips. Chicken was literally 4 tiny pieces of chicken. For a $13 salad I expect a decent salad."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for my birthday. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Our server was polite, accommodating, and prompt. I enjoyed my sandwich, which was the Chicken Parm. I had a Jack n Jill to drink. I had a lovely experience!"}
{"text":"What a dissapointment.  Had a steak there that was cooked well done (i asked for medium)  any place that charges what this place does, should know how to not destroy a steak. Rest of the meal was meh. Service was pretentious."}
{"text":"They're like little spiny crunchy marine crustaceans made from potatoes"}
{"text":"I am from Virginia and wish we had a place like this!  I can judge very easily how good a restaurant is just by tasting their ranch dressing (which made \"in-house\").  Their fries were amazing and the burgers...well, both shoes slipped right off.  I will be back when in town again...look forward to it!"}
{"text":"I have gone here several times and I have to say, not only is the food amazing, but of all the other Burntwood locations, this one's management is beyond excellent!  Their manager, Bill, gets to know his customers. He is completely hands on always. Every time I go there, he is out with the patrons and his staff, either serving, seating or just checking in.  The food is always excellent and service consistent and reliable. I highly recommend this location more than any of the others by far."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and the food was excellent!  We came in at happy hour ( 7 days aweek!) And had prime rib aujus, dip the bomb! With tavern tater-tots homemade,with salty camel apple pie ice cream! The best at a great price and atmosphere.  Our waitress Nicole  and Manger  Katelyn took good care of us."}
{"text":"To start off the food is expensive but I felt like you got what you paid for. Our waitress was amazing and attentive without being overbearing as the girlfriend and I were having a date night. I got the chicken quesadilla for an app and it was large with flavorful dipping sauces. The entree I ordered was a filet mignon medium rare that was a little more rare than I would prefer. I did send it back which I've done maybe 3 times in my life but they were very pleasant about it and made sure I was satisfied when it came out the second time.  The food was really good, the drinks were great, and to top it off the inside of the restaurant really has a relaxed and sophisticated vibe. I plan to visit again for future date nights!"}
{"text":"The stone and brick and lighting in here is really great. We sat out on the patio. Their beer selection is good and the menu sounds really amazing. But the food didn't deliver on taste. Just alright. I do want to go again though, maybe we just didn't pick very good menu items. The service was great."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good place around town that has a create your own bloody mary bar,  let alone a place that has bloody mary's, so I was pumped when I found out Burntwood had them! They are fantastic! You get to choose what flavor vodka to go in your bloody mary and then you can choose your on toppings including celery, blue cheese stuffed olives, pepperoni, salami, bacon, cheese, pickles...the list goes on and on.   Along with their delicious bloody mary's, I think their food is excellent. The tuna nachos are to die for! The salads are delicious with just the right amount of dressing, the steak is delicious, the pasta is delicious, I could go on for a while...but I digress."}
{"text":"Great ambiance but the food was ok at best. We came here with our family celebrating a joyous occasion. So, we had a large selection of dishes. Overall, no one was very happy w their food. Great looking restaurant with fabulous help. This restaurant is just missing it by a little, great food would make this place a perfect place."}
{"text":"I was super excited not to make the long haul to Cuyahoga Falls to experience the good food  and atmosphere of Burntwood. The Montrose location did not disappoint on either. However, the drinks were not good at all. I had to resort to drinking wine.  I sat at the bar and noticed that no attention was given to making the drinks.  The area was not clean, the male bartender was doing entirely too much and never washed his hands.   I hope that the drinks and service improves."}
{"text":"I really like the place itself, the fireplaces, but... We're sitting here for 40 minutes trying to be patient. The food is not even nearly our table, we had to repeat twice that we need our juice with NO ice, dry martini with olives, tea with sugar and teaspoon. Had no idea what a terrible service they have... :("}
{"text":"If only the food was as good as everything else about this place. I really like the atmosphere, the location, valet parking, a guitar playing singer there one night who was fantastic, the service, beer selection, fireplace. The pumpkin ravioli appetizer was fantastic.  The chicken wing appetizer was pretty small and unremarkable. The main meals the few times I've been were lacking something. For instance the bottom of the burger and another sandwich was very soggy and the other sandwiches I've tried were just ok."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for business meetings or just to relax and have some cocktails!   Friendly staff, management and great food/drinks."}
{"text":"Burntwood Tavern (BWT) is a nice place for lunch, dinner or drinks with appetizer in Rocky River. I would place the BTW somewhere above the typical national cookie cutter chains like Applebees and Yard House but not quite at the level of white table cloth pricey restaurants where you would expect to drop a few Ben Franklin's for dinner. The Rocky River location has a cool rustic look taking advantage of the old Beachcliff movie theater bones. Great looking bar and covered patio set the stage for a fun casual dinning experience.  A well rounded selection of beers in tap from local, regional, national and a few imports should satisfy most hop fans. There is a full service bar with a tempting looking Sunday Bloody Mary station for the mixed drink fans.   My wife and I decided to have a few apps and salad for our Sunday lunch. The Tuna Nachos have become one of our favorites with crispy nachos and nice serving of tuna. The garnish and sauce on the nachos compliment the tuna without stealing the spotlight. Our second app of firecracker Shrimp were also very good, nice heat and side dipping sauce, but the plating was a bit dull. We also ordered a Field Green Salad that we told our waitress we would be splitting between the two of us. The kitchen split our salad onto two plates when served up to us, appreciated touch."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on a Sunday.  The Bloody Mary bar looked interesting.  I was not impressed with the Tavern Steak Salad.  It was quite small and the steak had parts on it that I couldn't chew."}
{"text":"This has a good atmosphere but can get loud when they have live music. The food is really good. I enjoyed the chicken cheese steak sandwich. I will get it again. The tuna nachos looked wonderful.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice lunch or dinner. Bring a date, go solo. It doesn't matter.   Also the outdoor patio is great allowing for fresh air while you eat."}
{"text":"After posting my original review, Burntwood's business manager contacted me with an update that they had moved all live bands to the outdoor patio, an excellent choice. The personal message was greatly appreciated, and immediately put Burntwood back on the list of considerations.  I returned recently with two friends for a lunch outing, and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of wait on what I was afraid would be the Friday afternoon lunch rush. The restaurant was moderately full, but still felt spacious and airy in the heat of the summer day.  We placed our orders with our kind server quickly, burgers for my friends and salmon for me, and enjoyed catching up while we waited. I left the table for a moment, and when I returned, their burgers had arrived, along with an enormous apology for me as my plate of salmon had been dropped. I smiled and told the terribly apologetic and worried server that it was quite alright, and my friends and I continued to enjoy our time together. He then returned with a bowl of complimentary lobster bisque for me, and upon my informing him of my unfortunate dairy allergy, he left the bisque for my friends and returned again with the most lovely salad to enjoy while I waited. I would have been perfectly content to wait without, but was touched by the generosity and insistence to make up for the delay.  My salmon came just about as my friends were finishing up their (delicious and throughly enjoyed) burgers, and was enjoyed just as much then as it would have been sooner. When the checks came, mine was absent, and replaced with another apology about the incident. I left with a full and happy stomach, and much gratitude and admiration for the way Burntwood interacts with their patrons. I will be returning and recommending."}
{"text":"Went for lunch w/a friend today, 12-9-15,  Ordered the burger and fries.  Fries came out not hot enough, but, at my request, they were replaced quickly.  The fries are very good.  The burger, unfortunately, tasted slightly fishy to me, as if it were cooked on a grill that had just been used to cook some seafood or fish.  Also, the burger did not taste fresh to me.  Again, they replaced it with another burger, which took a little longer than I'd hoped, and which although was much, much better than the first one, lacked that steaky, beefy, juicy taste a great burger has.  I told the wait staff the burger was much better, because it was much better than the first one.  I ate the entire second burger, but I cannot say it was a great burger.  The manager removed the cost of the burger from my bill, without my asking him to do so, which was a good will gesture; however, with all the wonderful places to get burgers in the area, in my opinion, this place misses the mark.  The dining area is very nice and inviting, but very loud with the high beamed, vaulted ceiling and stone floors.  It looks swell, with a working fireplace and all, but if a $10 burger can't be succulent, steaky and wonderfully rich tasting, I see no point in going there again for a burger. I rate the service as quite good."}
{"text":"Came here for their happy hour and was underwhelmed.  The restaurant itself is a great building - nice outside seating, large and warm inside with booths, tables, and expansive bar.  But when it came to the drinks - cocktails were on the weak side.   Food was just not good.  The calamari was overly breaded and rubbery.  The flatbread tasted okay, but nothing to write home about or something I would order again."}
{"text":"I honestly had one of the top 3 best burgers I've ever eaten here today! I ordered the burntwood burger, which is piled high with toppings; it has a fried egg, bacon, cheese, and a delicious hashbrown patty along with the moist burger. When I cut into it, the egg broke, coating the rest of the burger with added flavor and more moisture. Even though the burger was enormous, I ate the whole thing since it was amazing.  I got a side of the homemade tater tots which were much different than I expected, but in a good way.  They were the size of hush puppies, cooked thoroughly and seasoned to perfection.  I washed this delicious lunch down with a sparkling pink lemonade spritzer that had actual muddled strawberries mixed in... Yum!   The staff was very friendly and attentive, and I will most definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"So I tried this place out on a whim and oh my did I love it. More importantly my server was so well informed. She made my night. If you go here ask for Ana!"}
{"text":"A great atmosphere and wonderful staff. Jen was the best waitress I ever had. She was friendly and so damn funny. Had great drinks; jack and Jill and Moscow mules. The tavern tots were great!!! The steak and frites were cooked perfectly and the Mac and cheese was amazing :)"}
{"text":"Something was off.  We have gone here several other times, and usually have a great meal.  Tonight, there were several problems.  Our server was very distracted and inattentive throughout the night.  Drink refills took forever.  The kitchen did not send out our meals at the same time.  One of the meals was not prepared as requested.  Food quality was only average.    After dinner, it took forever for dessert orders to arrive.  Then, the waitress said she could not bring us our checks because \"the computers crashed.\"  We were offered complimentary coffee, but it never came.  When the computers were up and running, it took the waitress three times to bring us the right check.    Ultimately, they comp'd appetizers, soft drinks, and desserts because of the problems.  But I would've preferred better food and service."}
{"text":"Couldn't even get a refill on my water glass.... I have been to Bunrtwood in Brecksville many times.  it is not my favorite place, but at least they keep my water glass full.  My wife and I were in Aurora running errands and decided to give Burntwood a try.  Big mistake.  Out serving would periodically stop by with an assumptive, \"Everything okay here\" and walk away.  Each time, we would ask for something that was not right or missing.  We would later see him and it looked like he was wandering around the restaurant not sure about what he should be doing.  At the end of the night, it was over $100.00 for a few drinks made with ok-at best liquor, swordfish WITH the skin still on it and a single glass of water between two people. Going there again?  No Thank you!"}
{"text":"Burntwood Tavern in Cuyahoga Falls has one of my favorite patios in the greater Akron area. There are balconies wrapping around the building that overlook the water, and a larger patio with Edison-style string lights and lounge seating. The interior is also gorgeous - very rustic/modern with really unique lighting. It's the kind of place you would go to even if the food was subpar because the ambiance is so amazing. But the food is great, too.   The menu rotates seasonally, and my absolute favorite is the pumpkin ravioli. I've tried a lot of items on the menu and there really isn't anything I haven't liked. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a shot - for happy hour and apps on the patio or dinner and drinks inside around the bar or near the fireplace."}
{"text":"This place was okay.  The food is very good with great presentation and portion sizes are good depending on what you get.  The service is less than perfect.  They hurry you along by bringing everything at once. I got about 5 bites of my salad before my main entree come in for a landing. They also were sure to spend time selling me their VIP program which really does nothing but encourage you to come back more and spend more. The desserts are tasty but portions leave you wanting more.  They also come in these puny beer mugs which makes them hard to eat and spilling a good share on the saucer napkin. All and all a good experience, but I would not go out of my way to gone here. Great food marginal service."}
{"text":"Plain and simple...unless you are among those in Brecksville looking to score something in the bar you will no doubt agree that this place needs an enema. I'm done with the 2nd chances. Poor service and cold food are apparently the norm. NO STARS if I could."}
{"text":"I finally decided to review the Burntwood, and I was feeling bad because I was only going to give it three stars despite the food being pretty good. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one that doesn't think it deserves four or five stars! When I go here, I get the feeling that our business really doesn't matter. It wasn't always like that. I remember my first trip there, they welcomed me with a glass of champagne because it was my first time! Since then, it seems they don't have to go out of their way any more. Service is slow, it seems they are always running out of things, and they just don't care. The food is definitely above average though. I hear the tuna appetizer is wonderful. The thought of homemade tater tots sounded amazing, but I found them flavorless and greasy.  My advice is to go across the street to Panini's."}
{"text":"Turrible. Everything was under whelming. I've had better tasting and better prepared food at applebees. Their other locations are so much better, this was a giant disappointment."}
{"text":"A table of three had to wait 15 minutes for drinks (just water and iced tea) and another 20 before we could order. After we ordered, we waited an hour for our food, while tables that had sat down after us were able to receive their food before us. I would understand the wait if we had ordered something complicated; however, our order was two wedge salads and a plain burger. Our waitress was nice enough, but the wait was incredibly frustrating and ruined the dining experience."}
{"text":"Yay for \"new\" American! The food at Burntwood was hit and miss, but mostly hit. We got the Tavern Chips that were so good we ate them all before I remembered to take a picture. For our dinner we got the pork chop (which was a huge portion of 2 chops) and it had that great smoky wood smell.  We wanted to try the fish sticks, but didn't want to commit to the whole meal, so we go the app, which was a huge serving, but the fish was very bland and the coating not crisp. The heaping portion of fries were great though. I also got the sliders. The meat was cooked perfectly, but they lacked condiments with just a tiny squirt of ketchup and tiny slice of homemade pickle. Great house cabernet too!   The atmosphere was really cool. We were on the closed in patio and it was raining hard, and the sound it made was nice, it kind of muffled everything around you. And for an indoor/outdoor patio, I was perfectly warm, which for this freeze baby is seldom the case. I can't wait to try it out in the summer!   Also the wait staff was very sweet making suggestions and being attentive. There was also a small band playing songs that if you went to HS in the 90's you were loving.    Almost forgot, and this is a biggie, do NOT get the coleslaw if you have any desire to not smell like onions for the next day and a half. Seriously, it was hard to sleep."}
{"text":"Going for lunch is a better option. Lunch prices are more reasonable. Dinner is over priced and not worth it. I got a french dip and sweet potato fries. It was ok. I wish they toasted the sandwich bun. Because as soon as you bit into it it falls apart and when you toast it it holds up a little better. The fries were cooked perfectly and the bartender Ian was friendly and very helpful. Made me a delicious cocktail. \"Jack and Jill\" was perfect hint of blueberry I loved it. The Resturant is open and right on the river and is very open and has a warm atmosphere. Overall a good experience. $-$$$"}
{"text":"We weren't sure where to go for brunch as we are from out of town.  We stopped in and were very pleasantly surprised. We sat outside over the river.  The decor and service were great. My wife had the Salmon Benedict and I had a BELT.  Both were perfect. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the crispy potatoes were amazing.  We will definitely stop back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"This place has been plagued by execution errors from it inception.  The Chagrin location consistently outperforms it.  The best thing the Burntwood group does is interior design and their bars.  The food is solidly average.  The new Kitchen 56 blows this place away.  Too bad Solon needs better restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food,  love the atmosphere. Warm and inviting.. Fireplace going....staff was friendly.. Great place.. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Service sucks still waiting for server to pay bill for 15 minutes. Food good but very slow"}
{"text":"Average. Went for brunch with the family. Got there early, no wait, seated immediately. Decent service, although server never did bring cream for my coffee (asked twice).  Kitchen was very slow, and when food came out it was over-cooked. 2 of us had eggs benedict and the eggs were completely hard. Kind of defeats the purpose of poached eggs.  Hash was decent, but again, eggs were done hard (asked for over-easy). Chicken and Waffles. Chicken was so overdone it was almost inedible. Waffle was very small.  I'm sure everything just sat back in the kitchen for way too long.  Now for the good. Cocktails were great.  'Make your own' bloody marys were cool.  And the decor... was like a Disney theme restaurant.  A little over the top, but for a date night it would probably work well.  Upstairs loft looks like a great place for a big group. Prices were reasonable.  Decor will impress, food will not."}
{"text":"Standard American pub/bar fare.  For the vegetarian, not a lot of choices as would be expected.  I ordered a tomato and mozzarella salad, which was actually quite good, as well as a side of sweet potato fries, which were also crisp, appropriately salted and sure did hit the spot.  The food was good, the service was solid and the atmosphere is actually quite nice.  I would consider coming back here just to sit at the bar, which to me seemed like one of the coolest, most nicely decorated bars, with great ratio of seats to flat-screen TVs I have seen in the area.    I'm giving this 3 stars because while the food and service is good, it's nothing really special.  It's a good place, with a good atmosphere, which why it deserves a good (3 star) rating."}
{"text":"Extremely long wait.  Do not go without a reservation.  We were told 30 min, then 45 min m, then waited 1 hour & 30 min for a table.  Will not go back"}
{"text":"We had a large group that wanted to get together. Other places in the area didn't want us... Too bad for them. Mike said come over and we'll fit you in.  Wonderful service, food and team. Thank you for your short notice - hospitality. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. We decided to try something different so we chose this place over our favorite restaurant which happens to be right next door. Ordered the tater tots which was supposed to come with cheese fondue, but turned out to be nothing more than microwaved Velveta. I had the chicken avocado flatbread, which was blah. Probably won't eat the leftovers and I hate wasting food. He had the tavern burger which was huge, and tasty to him. Probably won't be in a rush to get back to this place. Wish we would have gone with our usual choice."}
{"text":"Burntwood Tavern is one of my favorite places, so I was really excited when I received word that they were building one in Fairlawn! I have tried many things on their menu, all have been delicious. I am vegetarian so I might be a little biased here, but the veggie wrap is my favorite menu item. I know it's good because even my non-vegetarian friends love it as well! I also always get the hummus for an appetizer"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and a decor with lots of - you guessed it - wood.  The menu has a little of everything, from a great variety of appetizers to salads, sandwiches, and meat/seafood entrees.  Burntwood is a cozy spot with many seating options, including at the bar, near the bar, in the dining rooms, and on the patios.  The service was good although I would call this a place for a leisurely meal, which would not be good if you're in a hurry.  The crowd is on the older side, with an average age somewhere between 40 and 60.  (Shall we say 50?)    The happy hour is a great deal, with $5 appetizers and $3-5 drinks.  The best part is the healthy-ish appetizers, including hummus (which comes with sliced cucumbers along with pita and plantain chips), pumpkin ravioli, and smoked chicken quesadilla.  Share a few of these plus a side salad and you're set."}
{"text":"Good old standby with amazing, different menu options. Living nearby, we frequent Burntwood as often as possible. Sometimes we make a Gabe day decision to go which often leaves us unable to be seated. If you are going for dinner, make plans in advance (reservation!) because they get crazy busy.  We have only had one time when service was bad. Seems somebody wasn't sure if we were their table and just kept cruising by us. We finally had to approach the host to get someone. Other than that, their service is terrific.  We always get the tavern chips for an appetizer. Their  salads are very tasty. I usually get the Tavern Dip or the sliders as my meal. Always spot on delicious and fresh. I went for brunch a few times too and that was a nice experience."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good staff, low quality food.  The Schweibel's bread factory is nearby, now you know who supplies their sandwich bread and buns.  I would give 2 stars if not for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"There are several of these throughout the area. We Met up with friends for a 40th birthday party at the Chagrin Falls location.   For me, I really enjoyed the cozy quaint atmosphere this place provides. Nice log cabin feel with a nice fireplace. There is lots of space here but it does not feel overcrowded.   The staff there was top notch. Friendly, knowledgeable and prompt. We were a party of 16 and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate us.  They even brought out some sparkling wine for a birthday toast, all on the house.   The food was just fine. I would say a step above your 'typical' bar food. Everyone enjoyed the appetizers and entrees.  I have no issues whatsoever and would come back for sure."}
{"text":"We have been to Burntwood many times and keep coming back for very good food, good service and a rustic casual environment. It's consistent. For a starter,  three of us shared the calamari and a Sicilian flat bread. The calamari was light and tender. The Sicilian flat bread had sausage, pepperoni and some jalapeño (it gave it a nice little kick but you might stay away if you don't like spicy). The flat bread was crisp and flavorful.  For entrees my wife had the blackened shrimp tacos which is an appetizer but she chose it as her main course. Her comment was they were excellent. The size, quantity and taste and the siracha sauce made the fish excellent. I had a turkey Rueben.  It was large with fresh turkey, cole slaw and Russian dressing an delicious marbled rye bread. Very nice. My daughter had the chopped salad, it was fresh, onions were held as requested as well as the salad dressing on the side.  The only thing I didn't like was while it was happy hour , but draft beer was not included among the happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"The tater toots we're great and the service was good. Looked like a clean we'll run location."}
{"text":"Tried the one in Solon this week and the Fairlawn location. All the Burntwood are amazing!"}
{"text":"We love Burntwood Tavern. I go a couple nights a week, you cannot beat the Happy Hour Special!! Great staff, great bartenders, love the managers."}
{"text":"I had to update my review due to my recent experience this early evening. Its still happy hour and I'm looking for a place to sit around the bar. There were plenty of tables by the bar area but apparently they were all reserved for people who call ahead of time. That's bogus to me because normally in a bar area, its first come first serve. However, we got a table but it was all the way upstairs away from the crowd.   I asked about their drink with jack Daniels honey and I know it was from their summer menu. Our server replied \"I've been here six years and I don't know what you're talking about\". I looked up their menu on their website and there it is, their blackberry julep ice tea. But before I looked it up, I had already ordered another drink. Throughout service, we felt rushed and then our server had the nerve to tell us that the table has been reserved at 6:30 which means we had to leave by then. I am appalled by thus treatment. Of all the times I've been here this has been the worst. I felt embarrassed that I brought my out of town sister here to this place. After all of this,  I just realized that she never brought out any water for us.   I don't think I'll come back after this. Food has gone sub par as well."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place two stars was because of the pretty building and atmosphere and patio by the river. The service was horrible and for the price and nice kind of place the food was sub par. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks, and it wasn't that busy. The food took about 30 or 45 minutes more and was sub par. I got the BBQ chicken salad and felt like I got ripped off. It had barely any toppings, like ten black beans and a dash of green onions. It was supposed to come with avocado and although our server swore there was some kind of avocado salsa on there I sensed nothing of the kind. I could have tossed some chicken in BBQ and thrown it on iceberg at home and avoided paying $13 for crap. My friend got the tilapia and it was cold. My other friend got a steak and she did say she liked that. We were going to get dessert but the whole dinner affair with the wait on the food and drinks took almost 3 hours. So we went to the hibachi place across the street since we all left hungry and got sushi and dessert there. The service was excellent there, pretty sad since burntwood is supposed to be a nice place. At no time did the waitress apologize for any wait or ask how the food was. Even when I go to the Fox and Hound pub the manager always comes and asks how things are, every time. I didn't see anyone who seemed like a manager at any time I was there. Wouldn't dream of going back. It's a shame."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years during business travel and I can not find a flaw.  All food is fantastic, and the infused vodkas are very well done.  Hint, the hummus is excellent.   Renee in the bar is the cherry on top.  She is warm, friendly and a genuinely enjoyable personality.    My little home away from home.  Kudos"}
{"text":"Everything here was delicious! I ordered the pork chop with jalapeño peach sauce.. this piece of meat was beautifully cut and cooked perfectly! The sweet potato fries were sweet and salty.. my girlfriend had the chicken Madeira, super tender chicken, and the sauce was delicious! The ambiance makes me want to go the a cabin in the woods, great lighting, super warm. There was even live music! Not over powering, just a guy in a corner singing.. we also had the tavern fries! Tasty! And for dessert a chocolate cake served with raspberry ice cream. Our server Scott was personable and fun! He didn't rush us out the door and gave us time to finish our drinks and pack up our food. I will be back!!      10-14-16 Came back after the wonderful service and food we had last time, unfortunately it wasn't as awesome.. after a 35 min wait (with 6 open tables on the floor not bussed) we waited another 25 mins for our app!! (Which we had to ask someone to check on) we were told someone \"walked\" out and the kitchen got backed up.. we order tavern chips., literally cheese and chips.. was it the chip guy who quit?! Once they came, they were cold and the cheese sauce was runny and not at all creamy like it was last time. We ate them because the only other option was to gnaw on our arms.. HOWEVER. The wait staff as usual was great.. our server was extremely apologetic, he took our cold appetizer off our bill, refilled our drinks 3 times and I could tell by the look on his face he took responsibility for the issues.. our chops were great as usual and I will still be back.. so hats off to ALEX!! For keeping this review at 5 stars.. he's a nice guy who cares.. that's what makes a dining experience!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and cleanliness issues, yesterday my wife and I went there, we were seated on the patio, we were there for 30 minutes, NO ONE attended to us, waiters were attending two different tables next to us, other waiters cleaned one more table next to us but to no avail. This place does not even deserve 1 star, very dirty as well, sticky tabletops, bugs especially in the dining room, etc. In conclusion: we left, went to the oak barrel where we were treated like royalty."}
{"text":"First walking in, I had to wait a few minutes for someone to notice me. It was an hour before closing so I can give them the benefit of the doubt.  I decided to grab something to go and ordered the Salmon entree. It came with seasonal veggies and blistered asparagus. I added Sweet potato fries because I was starving. The bartender took my order quickly and quoted 10 minutes. To be honest, I'm not sure it was even that long. I was grateful though. I'd just come in from a delayed flight and was VERY ready to eat.  When I got back to my hotel, the food was still warm. Luckily, there wasn't too long of a drive. I hate hot food that gets cold. Unless it's pizza.  The salmon was a perfect medium/medium well. Very well prepared. The veggies and asparagus were seasoned well. There was a few broccoli florets mixed in with the veggies and they were almost raw. Would have preferred a bit longer of a cook time on those. My sweet potato fries were very good. Not too salty.  Would love to stop by here on another occasion when I'm not in a hurry. I bet the beer selection pairs well with some of the entrees."}
{"text":"Best service, fantastic food. Accommodating. Beautiful decor. 5 star all the way! Waiter Jim went over and above. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Oh man Burntwood I really wanted to give a 5 star review.  Love the ambiance.  Server was a bit off.  Ordered the River Burger which I would rate as 5 stars.  Reason for the 3 star review was service related.  We had ordered a few cocktails.  I've never been to a restaurant where they didn't ask if you wanted another...we were prepared to order more but our waiter never returned.  20 minutes after we started eating our meals we had to flag down our waiter for more waters.  Which then came 25 minutes later...at which point the rest of my food was cold.  I had stopped eating it as I was waiting for my refill and kept eating my cocktail ice to make do.  Luckily we did have one glass of water that we could split among us for the wait.  Would go back for the food with a low expectation of service."}
{"text":"On route to another restaurant I decided to consult Yelp for a good brunch alternative. They were not wrong about this place! From the hostess that took my reservation,  our server Michael (only his 3rd day there), to present conversation with Bill, one of the managers, this was a pleasant experience. The only reason for less than five stars was due to returning two table items that were below standard. The food was amazing! The atmosphere festive, reminding us of being in Big Sur California. Great value for a wonderful Sunday brunch. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Was at the Burntwood for Happy Hour and a first time customer.  Will probably go back.  Great pour and price at happy hour.  Appetizers were well prepared and served.  Very filling."}
{"text":"We had a great server.  The food was brought to the table quickly and everyone loved their entrée.  We will return.  It is an easy spot to grab a bite and or drink before or after a movie at the Regal in Crocker Park."}
{"text":"Burntwood never disappoints. The atmosphere at this location is wonderful, it's elegant enough for a nice night out but also laid back enough for a casual lunch.  The service is consistently friendly, and the food is also consistently delicious. You can't go wrong with the Tuna Nachos, or any of their sandwiches.  The sweet potato fries are also a must have!  I feel that the pricing matches what you're getting very well. The happy hour is great as well, half off appetizers!"}
{"text":"I have gone to their happy hours several times. Be prepared...the bartenders are extremely slow... Can't beat their $5.00 specialty drinks and 1/2 price appetizers though!. The tuna nachos are awesome, as are their flatbreads. The dinner entrees lack imagination and service is often confused, food inconsistent, cold etc.  Ordered the prime rib med-rare, came back med-well. Our entire party waited incredibly long for our food. Several of the dishes ended up going back. The side dishes were luke warm at best. The manager came over and compt us a couple of appetizers during our long wait. The food is a bit pricey for the portion and quality. Do not order the French Dip unless you like chewy meat. The burgers are what you would expect,nothing special. Fish and chips are pretty tasty. Their salads are probably the best value for taste and price. The Burntwood in Chag Town beats the service of the Solon restaurant pittifully. Their bar staff are very quick to service you and are all extremely friendly!!! My suggestion: Have your experience @ Chagrin Falls!!!!"}
{"text":"I had dined here previously, for dinner, last summer.  I was in the area, a few days ago and thought that I would check out Happy Hour....am I glad that I did!  Happy Hour is from 3-6 p.m (7 days a week!!!).  The bartender, Brandon, was super-nice and very attentive.  I ordered a Dragonberry Mojito, Blackened Shrimp Tacos and the Tavern Tater Tots....still dreaming about my choices (yum!!).  The Mojito was very good and included fresh muddled mint, just like a real Mojito should.  The tacos (3) were heavenly.  The shrimp was cooked just right, still plump and juicy topped, with crunchy cabbage, sriracha aioli in a grilled tortilla.  There was also a small stack of fresh tortilla chips, topped with fresh avocado salsa.  The Tavern Made Tater Tots  served with 3 dipping sauces were heavenly, unlike any tater tot that I've had before.  8-9 golfball sized, mounds of shredded, seasoned potatoes that were deep fried to crispy perfection.  These were SO GOOD!.   The drink and appetizers were 1/2 price during Happy Hour, which made the selection even better.  $16 dollars total.  I'll definitely go back!."}
{"text":"The signature Manhattan is a good drink.  Signature drinks and appetizers 1/2 price during happy hour.   The Tavern Dip sandwich is thin slice prime rib on crusty bread, melts in you mouth and not expensive Ask for complimentary pretzel bread and try the chicken sliders."}
{"text":"I am simply going to state the facts and you can draw your own conclusions.  I would never eat here again and I sincerely hope that this review costs them some business.  I had dinner at this restaurant with a friend on 11/10/16. When paying the bill with my debit Visa card I didn't notice that I had left my card there. The following morning before work I stopped to get breakfast and realized that my card was missing.  I have never \"forgotten\" a credit or debit card before.  I figured I must have somehow left my card in the wallet they put the receipts in.  I called the restaurant/bar when they opened and was told they had my card. I went in and picked it up that evening  On Saturday, 11/19/16 I had breakfast at another restaurant and used my debit Visa again. In this case I paid at the register ( which I will insist on doing in the future). Soon after ( less than one hour) I got a notice from my bank that my checking account was low on funds?  I looked up my account and found a $200 ATM withdrawal from a ATM in Manhattan (NYC) on the previous day 11/18 and then 4 more withdrawals from an ATM in Astoria (Queens), NY, totaling $600 on that morning, Saturday 11/19/16.  Those are the facts. Now for my beliefs which I also conveyed to the Visa Fraud Representative.  I do not think I forgot my card at Burntwood Tavern. I believe the sever kept my card.  Had I realized I didn't have it he would have given it back. He or someone in Burntwood during the next approximately 24 hours copied the information on my card to a counterfeit card they created ( they can also copy the strip making another card appear to be the original). The reason for the delay in stealing the money from my account is because It accessed my checking account. I normally don't keep much money there but my paycheck is deposited into it. My next paycheck after I ate at Burntwood was 11/18/16. You might wonder if it was really someone at Burntwood why would they have admitted having my card and given it back to me?  If they hadn't, I would have cancelled the card and that would have made it impossible to use the counterfeit one that they had created.  Why didn't I report the theft to the restaurant? Well this will serve that purpose and I didn't remember the name of the server  I will encourage everyone I come in contact with not to eat at this place and if management reads this and they haven't already heard from Visa Fraud, look into who was the server for me on that night. You should be able to find out.  As for the food my friend said it was okay. I just had a so-so dessert.  I can't give it negative stars, hence the one star.  Believe me, I wish I knew the server's name."}
{"text":"Happy Easter!  We came in for their Easter Brunch today and weren't very pleased at $31 pp, their Prime rib was literally raw.. out of bbq pork every time we went up, no desserts always waiting, potatoes were cold and our waitress well wasn't very efficient idk how many tables she had but... she only came around ever 10-15 to collect plates and refill drinks.   I guess for the price I was expecting to be a little well staffed, seemed people were waiting on a lot of things.  Way too many people who were waiting to be seated were waiting in the aisles so to get to the buffet you had to literally walk through a crowd of people waiting for tables. As for the food i did have it was ok..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. But the food portions and quality have great room for improvement. I wish they'd get a new chef!!!"}
{"text":"I see what they're going for here, and I back it. The nachos with the tuna is just smart. I especially appreciate the stylish presentation on the slate dish. My steak was medium rare, which is a nice surprise for someone who typically orders his steak medium rare. They need to improve their music."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful and great for a daytime date to relax and enjoy a drink . The food is bland and flies are dive bombing us everywhere.  The bartender was nice but agreed the appetizer we got ( shasimi nachos ) needs a sauce or something.  Most likely won't be back unless I get a coffee drink and sit in front of the fire and have a date."}
{"text":"The decor and ambience is really nice. We had a party of 12.  I was not impressed by service or quality of food. The pastrami sandwich presentation was thin sandwich and mixed vegetables were greasy. Food temp was barely above room temp. My ice tea was empty for last portion of meal. It was disappointing. One good touch was the champagne they provided for the 3 birthdays were celebrating. Nice touch."}
{"text":"great service from TJ  and Josh.  quick, competent and knowledgeable.   Food tasty and plentiful.   drinks excellent.  definitely a come back to  place   saturday night busy but service still excellent and not too noisy"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant over looking the river!! It's tucked in behind 2nd street but well worth the wait!! They have valet parking if needed. Was there on a Friday night the band outside was pretty good!!"}
{"text":"First off, there are several Burntwoods in the Cleveland area, so this only pertains to the Brecksville location.  Second, we used to be fans, but this past week caused us to lose our affinity for this place.  My wife and I ate there with another couple.  We arrived in one car, thankfully; parking was a bloodsport.  The lot that adjoins the restaurant is mostly for valet parking; all the normal parking was full by 530pm on a Friday night.  We were in my wife's Prius, so we generally don't let valets drive that...a car that has to boot up seems to freak them out.  I tried to park in the office building lot next door, but some guy came out, obviously employed by that office building, and told me I couldn't, despite all the offices being closed by then.  I was forced to park across the street in a bank parking lot and walk back across to the restaurant.  In 20F weather.  Nice.  When I got in, my party had already been seated...on the patio.  It's enclosed with a tent-like fabric, but there's no insulation and plenty of drafts.  There's a radiant heater on the ceiling, but it was doing very little.  My friend's wife is a freeze-baby and I could see she was already shivering when I arrived at the table.  I took my coat off and immediately put it right the hell back on.  I looked around and most everyone else on the patio was also wearing their winter coat.  Fucking ridiculous.  If I wanted to dress like I was skiing while eating, I would've grabbed a pizza and gone down to the Metroparks and sat at a picnic table.  I complained to the manager and he seated us in the main restaurant, right by the patio entrance, which was still chilly but at least we could take our coats off.  During the next 30 mins I noticed people out there complained and were reseated as well until the patio was completely empty.  It took a while for a server to come for our order so when he got there we ordered appetizers and our entrees at the same time.  Time went by and then a herd of wait staff arrived...with our appetizers AND our entrees at the same time.  Nice.  I like eating a cold entree.  I also ordered a glass of wine...it was a normal glass but it arrived less than half full.  I mean, c'mon...if you're only going to give me 4 ounces, at least put it in a smaller glass to make me feel good, for christ's sake.  I'm a huge fan of the smoked pork chop entree at Burntwood...you get two nice-sized chops, smoked to perfection.  Erm...well, you used to.  Apparently times are tough...one chop now.  I used to bring one chop home with a little of my sides and eat it for lunch the next day, but not anymore, I guess.  Also, the pork had very little smoke flavor this time.  Just to be a dick, I rationed my 4 ounces of wine till the end of my entree, but when it looked like we were going to hang out for awhile, I ordered another glass.  We were going to a show later and had some time to kill, so a relaxing after-dinner conversation would be the perfect close, right?  Sure...right up until the band that was apparently getting ready to play set up speakers RIGHT NEXT TO OUR TABLE and cranked up some pre-show dance music to start warming up the crowd.  Great...I guess we WON'T be enjoying a nice post-dinner conversation, since we couldn't hear ourselves think now, much less talk.  So now I'm staring at a full (well, not FULL, obviously) glass of wine and everyone's reaching for their coats.  Chug wine, grab coat, leave.  So in a nutshell, my take-away feelings were:  1.  We don't want you here, so we'll give you no place to park. 2.  You ignored that warning, so we'll freeze your ass off. 3.  Geez, you're stupid.  How about we give you less food and alcohol, will that get the message across? 4.  You're still not getting the idea, so we'll crank up shitty dance music right next to your table so you'll GTFO."}
{"text":"The food and service are very inconsistent.  They would be four or five stars if they were as good as they obviously can be.  The failed execution on a set expectation adds to the disappointment.  My biggest complaint is how poorly the kitchen executes things that should be very, very basic.  On one visit a colleague of mine found a barcode sticker in his caprese salad (see picture I have uploaded).  How do they miss a sticker on a tomato when they 1) wash it, 2) slice it 3) plate it 4) send it out for service?  On another visit, the kitchen forgot to add sliced apples and spicy pecans to my salad.  This wasn't a special request that they be added, this was a standard menu item of theirs and they just didn't finish it before sending it out.  Another colleague found in her tuna wonton appetizer a piece of string that was used to package the tuna.  Drinks can take forever to arrive, even when the house is not particularly busy.  And not just the complicated mixed drinks, things as easy as pouring wine and draft beer will wait on the slow bar.  The setting is very pleasant, and I look forward to Burntwood increasing their quality controls."}
{"text":"You can't beat the views at this Burntwood location! Awesome drinks and desserts! However, I was at this establishment last evening and my food was incorrect. Normally this is no big deal but it really bothered me that the server did not write anything down and the food came out wrong...   Will continue to stop in here from time to time!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is friendly and ambiance Is inviting. Service was  Fast and servers very friendly. The half chicken dinner was Not flavorful and the blistered asparagus Was over cooked. I was disappointed in my dinner. But will give it a second chance and try something else My husband had the Pot Roast dinner and was very satisfied."}
{"text":"We went to the Burntwood for appetizers and wine on a Monday evening.  The restaurant is beautiful and the historic elements of the \"old powerhouse\" are evident.    We sat in the bar/lounge area and watched the river... there's not a bad seat in the lounge!  Renee, the barmaid was personable and funny!  She suggested a bottle of wine since it was retail wine night - which saved us money.  We had the Pumpkin Ravioli (to DIE for!), the smokey Chicken Quesadilla, and the Blistered Asparagus.    Everything was perfect - a very romantic atmosphere!  A couple who appeared to be in their 70s was sitting near us holding hands, leaning together in quiet conversation, and sipping cocktails.  It doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"First off been here multiple times with just my wife without problems. However on December 28th came in after a round of Glassblowing with family plus 4 to try to eat and have since changed my mind.  We arrived at 7PM and were greeted promptly but with reservation from the hostess who asked if we had reservations immediately. We politely said no and were given a sigh and told we would have to wait 30-40 minutes. Which seemed appropriate due to the lack of chairs to seat more than 4 people at a time.  However as time went on and the 40 minutes passed with two large groups exiting and one being sat, we were told that they were clearing a section of tables for us by the other host. While doing so a manager came by and immediately told the employees that nope make that for a seating of 20 and basically booted our table to another group who had not arrived and were not due to arrive for another 20+ minutes.  The manager didn't even have the guts to come over and explain the situation and just sent over the poor host who said we were getting our tables ready to let us know it would be 30-40 more minutes. Prompting me to reach out to that manager who seemed to care less about us than the obvious group that bumped us.  I more than likely will tell my staff at my office about this lack of customer service and will be taking my clients to other business in the area than here.  What a shame!"}
{"text":"Burntwood tavern is a new addition to the crocker park restaurants. The bar area has the tv and the seating area has impressive chandeliers to appreciate. The service is fast and friendly. They have a kids menu. The margaritas were standard fare but strong. The smoked chicken quesadilla was good and the madera chicken was tender and perfectly cooked. The menu is extensive. The prices are reasonable. Overall we were happy when we left. Will i come back....sure. Is this because i would like to order the same food again....not so sure."}
{"text":"They have a very diverse menu. The quality food is good. The drink menu is extensive. My personal favorite is there a Manhattan. This is a great establishment to visit with friends. They have a one-man band that is phenomenal  and worth the trip alone."}
{"text":"Revisited Burntwood tonight after many years, and they did not disappoint! We went there for a special occasion and they took great care of the whole (not easy) group! I spoke with a gentleman (manager probably) when I made the reservation a few days ago and not only did he help us celebrate in a special way but he checked in on us all night long to make sure we were well taken care of! Our waitress combined with the manager we're both AMAZING, and I would definitely return! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night and this place was PACKED! They offer FREE valet ( how nice)  but it wasn't hard for us to find our own spot. We made a reservation and were a little early but we figured maybe we would be able to be seated ahead of time-- no chance because of how busy they were. No biggie, we went to the bar and got a drink. Luckily, we were able to catch a group getting up from the comfy leather couches next to the fireplace and were able to sink into  their coziness and just enjoy the atmosphere a little with our drinks, which I highly suggest, if you can :) There is ample seating in the bar and if you're not into waiting for a table, eating there would be a great alternative.  Food was amazing--we started with the tater tots (out of this world) and both my fiance and I ordered the burger medium rare. It definitely wasn't medium rare but it was delicious, nonetheless. I highly enjoyed every aspect of dining here and will 100% be going back.The woodwork and rustic decor throughout the whole restaurant is beautiful and it is the perfect place for any occasion. I loved the feel of it! Be sure to make a reservation!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: Amazing potatoes and shrimp tacos.  Wonderful decor inside!  Cons: Completely unwelcoming environment. Came in with a group of four, not welcomed at all. Servers seemed uninterested in working. Did not make for a good start.   Some food is very salty--way too much oil and salt, can hardly taste the food."}
{"text":"We love Burntwood and have been there so often, but today at 4:45pm on a Sat. the wait was 40 minutes and from where we were standing only we counted 8 tables open. People were walking in and turning around and walking out. I worked in restaurants for many years and understand there may be a reason for a table or 2 to be open, but not 8+. Sooner you seat them the sooner they can be turned. Wondering if they were understaffed?? So we are driving to Chagrin Falls to M which I realize is in the same family with Burntwood, but that's kind of ridiculous."}
{"text":"We decided on Burntwood Tavern for my mother in laws birthday and mine. We had our table ready for us when we came r cause we were able to make reservations for 11 prior to coming. Upon sitting down we were greeted by the manager who asked what we were celebrating and he brought us over a champagne toast. Totally started out celebratory dinner off right.  We started by ordering the hummus dish and it was delicious but also hard to screw up hummus.  We ordered the salmon dish, the Filet, the ribs , and a salad ! No complaints on the entrees at all. I loved the salmon which is what I ordered. Wouldn't change a thing about it. My husband had the filet and said it was cooked perfectly. He is a very picky eater when it comes to his steaks. We didn't get to try the ribs but my father in law and brother in law had them. One said they were just ok, the other states they were delicious. The service was pretty good. It took a few minutes to get some of the drinks, but overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service! I had their brunch menu for the first time and the brunch sliders were great.  We had a big party and we were celebrating  a big family event. They gave us a complimentary champagne toast.  Very accommodating and made us feel very welcomed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The complainers that have reviewed this restaurant need to eat at McDonalds or better yet stay home!! Brecksville is a nice area and it should deliver to a higher standard. If a person is intimidated by this again.... Stay home! The associates here do not discriminate against what your wearing or what you drive  My husband and I come here once a week and we love it!! Prices and menu items are awesome.  Occasionally a restaurant can make a mistake or have hair in your fries. Remember they're human just like you and me! I've cooked at home and accidentally dropped a hair in our food. From what I have read if this is all you have in your life to complain about and be ungrateful I truly feel sorry for you. The only thing people need to remember when being unkind or judgmental.... Is Karma!!! When you think about our lives and the horrible endurance that three young Cleveland girls went through.... Think about it and be grateful to God for what you have."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but the service is lacking. Party of 8 a bit after lunchtime took about 15 mins to seat despite available tables and over 45 (!!!) minutes to get the order to the table after we complained. Naturally, the main courses arrived before our appetizers. Waitress was bubbly but nowhere to be found when we needed her and couldnt answer questions about ingredients and allergens (but still didnt get a manager involved, go figure). In case you are willing to overlook all that, get the shrimp tacos from the starters section: not too sophisticated but fantastic, greasy deliciousness. Side note: Chagrin falls location is the bomb."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try dinner at Burntwood, being a huge fan of the owner's other restaurant, M. I appreciated the modern, yet log-cabin atmosphere of this place, which I feel gives it a unique position among others in the area. The food is a great value for the quality of the dishes - particularly the sandwiches. the California Chicken was a good choice - a rich BLT with chicken cooked right. I was a bit disappointed with the tuna nachos, which was apparently a house favorite...I wasn't sure the greasy wonton chips and tuna were a fit. I also had a taste of the Pork Chop, which was one of the best Pork Shops I have tasted in recent memory."}
{"text":"I work nearby and Burntwood is the place to be for Happy Hour. The starters are amazing, a good variety of dishes, and the selection of alcoholic drinks is great too. There's a bang for your buck too if you're a wine or mixed drink kind-of-person. Jim (silver-haired gentleman) is the best bartender I've ever had. Attentive, great mixes, knowledgeable, funnier than all get out. He's the top of the top! Alex and the others are gem too. Sit at the bar and you'll always have a good time with great service."}
{"text":"I like this location the most. More character. Food is the same as the other locations.  I like the guys tacos, though the corn salsa isn't my favorite. Service is good. Or didn't get too loud. Nice fireplace in the bar area."}
{"text":"Bland food, amateur service.    Ordered apps during happy hour, so at least didn't spend too much on the experience.  Ordered Artichoke dip (good, but barely hotter than warm), pumpkin ravioli (bland) quesadillas (cold, overcooked), hummus (boring), zucchini fries (no flavor), and sliders (nothing special) to be shared by all of us.  Then ordered 4 of their desserts served in mini-mugs.  Choc cake one was pretty good, but apple pie was odd tasting.  Orange cream ok, pumpkin cheesecake not good.  And BTW, what's with the valet service taking up all the good parking spots?  This is not an upscale restaurant where most of the women diners would be in heels.  So why block off all of the parking lot to reserve for valet?  Valet is appreciated when there's little or no parking, parking is far away, or the diners are dressed up--not when a parking lot with tons of spaces is right in front of entrance and patrons are wearing jeans.  Stupid!!"}
{"text":"REVIEW FOR HAPPY HOUR ONLY!  Burntwood Tavern offers happy hour 7 days a week, yes on the weekends too, from 3-6pm! Score! We came here before a wedding without knowing that and we were definitely happy campers when we found out. They offer 1/2 off appetizers, $5 signature drinks, $4-$5 house wine and $3 drafts.  We ordered the zucchini fries (too much breading on them, just tasted like grease), spinach and artichoke dip (very good- can't go wrong), a Moscow mule, a raspberry mojito, the raspberry orange crush and the berry mule. All of the drinks were delicious and strong. You can never go wrong with a $5 drink! The appetizer list looked awesome and they also offered flatbreads at half off. Overall, great HH experience.   They also have a big bar area (probably 30 chairs between both sides) and a huge outdoor area, but TIP you don't have to sit by the bar in order to enjoy the HH specials..."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice atmosphere. The appetizers are great, specially during happy hour. I Also ordered the turkey club, fries and coffee for lunch. Unfortunately,  the turkey club was below average no flavor and coffee was very weak. The fries were good though, I'll give them that! I would try this place again, but will strike those items off my menu."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. We say at the bar. We had to ask again and again to order drinks, food, plates for the appetizers. Surly attitude. It's a beautiful location, great patio. The food was good. We had chicken avocado flat bread (good) and spinach dip (not so good)."}
{"text":"Beautiful location. The calamari was very good, flat bread - so thin it barely held up the ingredients,  but tasty. So, why ding the place?  No parking. You should carpool.  And I was sitting at the bar, watching one waiter come pick up drinks for his table....they have the waiters add the garnish (olive, cherry, etc)...he used his fingers. Picked the fruit out, slid it on the swizzle stick. Not good hygiene."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, great food! Obsessed with the Asiago crusted chicken ! I've had it more times than I can count ! Favorite appetizers being the calamari and shrimp !"}
{"text":"The location here is great right on the river and the inside is decorated well so it has a nice ambiance but the quality of food sucks and does not reflect the higher price tag that comes with it. My food more closely resembled something you would get from applebees or TGI Fridays's except you pay double that here. What's most odd is the Burntwood Tavern in fairlawn is much better and has different menus; doesn't make much sense but I will never come back here"}
{"text":"We came in on Saturday afternoon for lunch. (Side-note: They have a nice brunch menu, though neither of us were in the mood for breakfast). The restaurant itself was gorgeous!!! It is right on the river, and they did a great job inside.   We ordered the Wonton nachos which we really enjoyed. Pro-tip, ask for lime to squeeze on top! I ordered the Asiago-crusted chicken which was good, but the tomato stuff on top and the potatoes and arugula salad were the stars in my opinion! My boyfriend however got the half-soup half-sandwich meal and it was not very good. The lobster bisque was okay, and his prime rib dip was so bad. It was almost entirely just the fat pieces.  Everything else went so well that we would definitely go back-- just avoid the prime rib lol"}
{"text":"Was home on leave and decided to check this place out. It was surprisingly very good. Being a beer snob they have a lot of selection of beers. I went with a Southern Tier stout. For appetizers we got fried calamari which were good. Wish they gave us more cocktail sauce to use. Dinner my dad had pork chops has some sweet potato fries that were amazing. My mom has short ribs. Okay. Came with a little bit of vegetables and that's it. It needed more. I got steak and tots. Steak was really good. Tots were homemade. Kind of weird to get used to but good. Dessert we all went with red velvet. But the cake was cold and I'm not a fan of cold cake. It also just kind of tasted like red food coloring. I wish they did a little better on the dessert. But all in all. A good place to go."}
{"text":"Loved it here! We sat outside in the patio area on a Friday night, were seated almost immediately. Happy hour was great- half price apps, $3 beers, $4 wines, $5 cocktails. We both got mules which were strong in a good way. The tater tots were phenomenal as was the calamari. Loved the atmosphere with a view of the river, plus any outdoor area with bulb string lights always gets me going. Great date night spot. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Only good thing this place has going for it is the happy hour. That way at least you can be buzzed for the awful dining experience you're about to have. Service took forever and food was tasteless. I used a gift card because I had complained about the Crocker location which was also awful. Too many good restaurants in Cleveland to waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant three times now and I would rate it a flat OK.  Not the best place I have eaten at but for Brecksville I'll be back.  They are not kid oriented so leave the kids at home (was a little uncomfortable with my very restaurant oriented 6 year old).  Keep practicing!"}
{"text":"It's essentially the next chain in training. There is nothing special, new, or unique going on here.  The beer list is good.  Beyond the beer, the food looks and tastes like chain joint food.  Mid-level ingredients prepared to exacting standards meant to keep costs low.  It's not worth the time unless you want pedestrian \"modern American\" chain food.  That's not to say the cooks do a bad job--nothing is cooked wrong, it's just not anything special.  For the same price, I can go get chef-driven from-scratch food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the French Dip. Heard its great and not up to par. French Fries were limp, and tasteless. Should have done the burger. Wife said her flatbread was good. Live and learn."}
{"text":"Some of my friends told me about this place. They always rave about it, so I decided to take my parents here for our weekly lunch date. NOT IMPRESSED!   Things I liked: 1. The atmosphere.  2. The patio.    Things I disliked: 1. Service sucked. When the lady brought our food out, she was staring at the food and then our faces like she was trying to figure out who got what. I told her which one was mine then started to tell her which one was my dad and moms, she snapped at me and said \"I know\". Not cool. Once we got our food, we only saw the waiter once. I actually had to get up and go to the bar to get a refill of my water. The waiter saw that and tried to explain he had a lot of tables in the back. I took a peak at the back, not a lot. Honestly I don't care, you should be able to handle \"a lot\" of tables. If you can't least have a personality and not act like a robot.  2. The French fries were so salty. You had to drink water after every fry to wash the salt down.  3. The center pieces of the table were tacky. I posted a pic of them.   Food wasn't bad. It was alright. I just got a basic cheeseburger, and my folks got the egg burger. We came during the lunch menu. Maybe I'll try and come again for dinner and see if I get better service and food I wanna rave about."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience working with Adam and our server who took such great care of our big party. It was pretty last minute but they took us in and we were so grateful! Everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"First of all I absolutely adore the aesthetics of this place. So much to look at, it's beautiful, rustic, and wonderful.  What compelled me to write this review however was my absolutely wonderful experience with Rachel, our server. She was pleasant, attentive, informative and patient in the most sincere way. We stayed for about two hours and drank like 100 cups of coffee but she was just so great the whole way through.  Our food was fresh and good, a little pricey but I think the quality is worth it. I recommend this place whenever I can."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time at the new location the other night.  I hate to say that they have some work to do to match their other locations.    The place feels like Hoggys/Champs reunion with a new bar top.  They took out some tvs and scuffed up the walls to make it look rustic, and hung about 100 pendulum lights around the bar, but thats about it.    They were not busy, but the staff has a lot of \"meetings.\"  Their attention is clearly not on the patrons.    The floors are like an ice rink.  I literally skated across them.  (Try using separate buckets for washing floors and dumping fryer grease.)"}
{"text":"I can't believe this location is still in business. They can't get very basic orders right (see pic). Don't waste your time or money at this place. Instead try J Alexander's next door. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"terrible food, terrible service! Way overpriced, this place won't last a year! save your time and money!"}
{"text":"Their house sodas are addicting. I enjoy their entire menu. The scenery is beautiful - but the restaurant is also very appealing! You must go- every local will recommend it. I have been for baby showers, rehearsal dinners, dates, and lunches with friends and it is suited for each occasion perfectly."}
{"text":"The drinks were good, service was a little slow, especially for a Wednesday, it was fairly crowded for mid week.  They recently opened, so we expected there to be a few kinks.  Our meals were good, but the fries with my husbands meal were cold, and my shrimp was cold (but still tasty).  We'll go back in a month to see if it's a bit smoother."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant and one of my family's go-tos when we can't decide where to go out of eat. Normally, we don't make reservations but if you'd prefer to not sit in the noisy bar area on a weekend, they are necessary. We don't mind since the service is still great in the bar, but it is noisier. The food is always excellent, especially the shrimp tacos and the flatbreads!"}
{"text":"Great place. The tater tots were unique and very good. I also got the pulled pork sandwich, which was delicious. Everything was reasonably price and it was a very nice atmosphere too. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Decent food but the service was bad.  I had the steak and tots. The steak was overdone and the asparagus was laying in a pool of oil. We saw our waitress once. My husbands food came out five minutes before the rest of the family. I never got a refill. And it took 15 minutes to deal with the check because they got confused by one of their gift cards. Our gift card payed for our entire meal but my husband wanted to leave a few extra dollars for the tip. The waitress ended up charging the whole meal to his debit card and the tip to our gift card.  It was just a bunch on nonsense. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  Made reservations for Saturday night, 5 people.  We were promptly seated in the very loud bar.  We asked for a different table and were told there or the patio.  We ate at the bar.  Our waitress eventually came for our drink order.  Drinks arrived about 15 minutes later then she left and apparently forgot about us.  Finally, she came for our dinner orders.  Dinner took forever and arrived about a half hour to 45 minutes later.  We had to track her down for more drinks.  Interestingly the check came very promptly.  As for the food, our son was still hungry after having the street tacos so I gave him some of mine.  Nothing to write home about.  The burger was so-so.  The salad was good and the kids dinner was ok.  Never again.  Next time we will go to a restaurant who appreciates the customers and actually has good service.  2nd time there, first time was just as bad."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and tried Burntwood for the first time last night and will make it a regular spot. They had me at pumpkin ravioli! It is an appetizer but the portion is large enough to be an entree. From there we just had sanwiches, which were good too, but look forward to trying entrees in the future.  The ambiance is among the coolest we've been with cozy tables for 2 or large groups. We moved to the large bar area for a nightcap too, as the area is just as inviting.   I don't understand the negative reviews because everything (except a crabby hostess) was excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious food and prompt, friendly and accurate service! There really isn't much more to say. Had the classic brunch and my boyfriend had the salmon salad - both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Burntwood is a fun, hip new restaurant with craft and good food. The atmosphere is that of your neighbor's sweet finished basement = comfy but chic. It is a great place to meet up for a drink or to go for date night. Meatloaf special on Monday is great!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times now. A couple times for the Mother's Day brunch (Rocky river's is better than westlake)   Good variety in selections, good service Solid restaurant to go to for slightly above average meals (good but not memorable...you know what I mean?)  Would go back there, maybe once or twice a year."}
{"text":"Return visit, five of us, Sunday night.  Seated right on time, waiter comes to the table and that is nearly the last thing that went right, the whole night.  Honestly, if you can't handle several tables, either get help or get out of the business.  It can be tough, I'll admit, but this guy forgot something on each of his dozen visits to the table.  \"Is everything still EXCELLENT?\" he asked.  Well... Four of us left food on our plates.  \"Can I get boxes for you?\"  Uh, no.  That's why it's still on the plate.  They've been open for two-thirds of a year, now.  Place is packed, so there's no reason, really, for them to improve the service or the food.  Except.  There are many, many better places, some not that far away.  I'm still kinda pulling for them; maybe they'll work on bettering the experience out of professional pride.  Or something.  (They could, and really SHOULD, be a great restaurant.  Good location, some buzz... I wonder if they will.)  I won't repeat my diatribe against the silly and thoroughly unnecessary valet parking, but will offer this valuable lesson.  After we got the car and handed over the tip, I spied someone cutting into the south driveway.  I'm not sure we'll ever return, but if we do, I'll park on the south side and just hand the guy my tip on the way in.  It will save ten minutes, easy, and everyone's happy."}
{"text":"Had dinner there this evening. 6:30 reservations, seated within 5 min. We sat next to a group of 14-16 people. Very noisy, couldn't hear ourselves talk. Asked for another table. Told one wasn't available but would be soon. We said we'd wait in the bar. Had a drink and returned to the hostess station, not once, not twice, not three times but four times before they seated us. This took 65 min.!!! The rest of the evening was fine. Food was good. It's a shame that some teenagers couldn't do their jobs better and ruined a good evening. Even though the food was good, I won't be recommending this restaurant to anyone I know b/c of other issues!"}
{"text":"To say that this place caters to the wealthy, white suburbanites of Northeast Ohio is a bit of an understatement. Just take a look at where the other three locations are - Rocky River, Solon, and Chagrin Falls. It's a stereotype and, judging from the abundance of high-priced foreign cars packed into the parking lot (our little green Kia stuck out a bit), they're doing quite well. Speaking of parking lots, I've got to get this off of my chest before I can continue.  I don't mind valet parking. It has a time and a place. It's great when a restaurant is located in a busy downtown area where parking is at a premium. It's great for impressing your date and it's great if there are private, monitored lots in less than reputable neighborhoods. What I do have a problem with is so-called \"complimentary\" valet. You know the kind. You pull in, see the sign and about a dozen red-vested 19 year-olds scurry to open your doors. What the hell. This is a private lot located around the restaurant. Why the hell do they have valet? I've been parking my own car for 23 years. I think I can handle it. Not so fast. At this Burntwood Tavern you have no choice. This also means you basically have no choice but to fork over $3-$5 for the obligatory tip before you head home. I was irked before I even walked in the doors. Enough said.  The Burntwood Taverns all appear to follow the same Restoration Hardware theme and this location was right on point. It's got pieces of old barn beams traversing the ceilings, copper-topped bars, warm colors, dark woods, rusty artwork on the walls, a big stone hearth for gathering. It really does have a nice vibe to it. Comfortable and perfect for lingering if that's your thing. We showed up around 6pm on a Saturday and the place was jammed. Thirty or so minutes for a table. No thanks, we snagged two seats around the corner at the bar.  There was a great energy in the bar area. Plenty of people chatting, drinking eating. It wasn't too loud, either. I think the architecture helped to dampen the din. Our bartender, Scott, was fantastic. He was friendly, attentive in just the right amount and seemed to be having a good time. The beer selection is decent with about a dozen taps and a matching set of bottles. A nice craft beer offering, no doubt. They've also got plenty of mixed drinks if you like less water with your alcohol. The menu here is pretty extensive. Think American pub fare with plenty of your favorite comfort dishes mixed in - fish and chips, pot roast, BLT, burgers, salads. There's something for everyone. Here's how our meal went:  Tavern Chips - I'm a sucker for homemade chips. Cover them in bacon, cheese and garlic and you've got my attention. The chips were perfect, warm, crispy and well seasoned. The Gorgonzola melting with the bacon and the crispy chives...need I say more?  The Wedge Salad - One good thing about a wedge, you know what you're in for. A crispy quarter-head of iceberg topped with tomato, eggs, bacon and carrots. The surprise here was the Parmesan peppercorn dressing.  Well done. The wedge. The only healthy thing about it is the word \"salad\" in its name.  Lobster Bisque - My wife digs the bisques and what's not to like? Heavy cream, sweet lobster, tomato, a drizzle of herbed olive oil. This one didn't disappoint.  Tavern Steak & Potatoes Quinlan - I needed some red meat and I needed it bad. Normally served with fries I opted for the potatoes Quinlan (roasted red-skins mashed slightly and then pan-fried in butter until crispy). I suggest you do the same. The 10oz steak, ordered medium, was cooked, well, sort of medium. The meat's temperature was a tad uneven with one end leaning toward rare and the other toward well-done. It was still tasty and the asparagus, slightly charred, were a great companion.  Overall, our experience here was a good one. We really liked the atmosphere, at least in the bar, and the food was tasty and filling. The few hiccups there were were easily overlooked in favor of the bigger picture and I have a feeling that we'll find ourselves paying them a visit again."}
{"text":"I always forget about this place as a potential option for brunch. But I'm glad I finally stopped in to check it out!   The general aesthetic is not only rustic, but also charming and a little sophisticated. Nice full bar, a great view, and open spaces.   Sunday's are particularly busy. I came in on a Sunday at 1, and we had a 45 minute wait. I think this place gets a lot of squatters though, because there were only three people ahead of my party (4) and the restaurant is quite large.   Now, onto the good bits. The only reason I am giving this place a four, is because they have a PHENOMENAL Bloody Mary bar with a variety of vodka infusions (get the jalapeño garlic!). The actual bar itself had a great array of topping, seasoning, and tomato juice options.   Also, we ordered a batch of the homemade tator tots and not only were they surprisingly delicious, but they were seasoned to perfection and had great flavor.   Onto brunch: I ordered the breakfast burrito which was equally dry, soggy, and lacked flavor. It needed a salsa and some spices. My boyfriend ordered the chicken biscuit, and the biscuit was extremely dry and hard, but almost inedible. My friend got the classic brunch plate and she commented that the breakfast potatoes were bland.   If I come here again, it'll be for the BM bar. That in itself is worth being a regular. Only $5 per drink, too!"}
{"text":"Burntwood Tavern had great half price appetizers and flatbreads during Happy Hour from 3-6 pm. Loved the atmosphere and it was packed when I went! Fast service and the food was delicious! Def a recommended place!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a concert and stopped here for a late lunch...was very pleasantly impressed! Very cool building and nice outdoor seating on the patio over looking the river. If you are in Cuyahoga Falls and looking for a place to get a drink or bite to eat I would highly recommend the Burntwood Tavern. Reasonably priced and delicious!"}
{"text":"The entrees are good though a bit small in portion size for the price.  Unfortunately the appetizers fall a bit flat for me.  It's a decent place for an impromptu happy hour, as they have HH daily from 4-6 and not just on weekdays.  In addition to drink specials (try the moscow mule), they have half price appetizers and flatbreads during happy hour.  It's kid friendly -- they even offer crayons for little ones and on mondays, I believe kids eat free with the purchase of an adult entree."}
{"text":"This is one of my top five favorite places in Cleveland. With house infused cocktails that rotate seasonally and a warm atmosphere I tell everyone on the west side to stop in. My favorite cocktail would be the pear of cucs. The food is amazing great entrees. Live music sometimes, awesome happy hour and great staff. I have not loved something server was happy to make it right and manager always stops by to check in."}
{"text":"First time here with friends did not wait long especially in a Saturday night good food service was good waitresses and waiters did not seem happy no one had a smile on their faces cheer up"}
{"text":"1st time here ... To start we had an appetizer the blackened shrimp tacos, outstanding !! Then my friend had the tavern steak ordered medium well came out medium rare + .. The blistered asparagus looked completely dry and they were hard. I had the fish sandwich and house salad. Sounds great.. the fish was a huge portion which was fine but again not seasoned it had no flavor whatsoever. The salad was subpar the house dressing again no flavor .. Since the appetizer was awesome we thought we were in for a totally great dining experience. Maybe next time ?? With great tasting food a little seasoning goes along way."}
{"text":"We love coming to this Burntwood location! The tavern steak is amazing and I loveeeee the tavern tater tots! We have always had amazing service and food every time we come here. The manager bill is always there and is very hands on. Parking isn't always easy on the weekends but they have valet."}
{"text":"I had dinner last night here with friends. The restaurant is much larger than it seems and the decor is very inviting. I had the pecan crusted Tilapia which was excellent. The other members of the party had steak and chicken and both said they were delicious. The service was friendly and attentive. The house salad was a very nice size and the greens were fresh. Sweet potato fries hit the spot as well. I detracted one star for noise level. While we were able to carry on a conversation, I had to raise my voice louder than I like to and by the end of the night my vocal cords where a little sore from the strain. Other than that, I will definitely come back for the food and maybe asked to be seated in a quieter part of the restaurant if there is such a place."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but food was not that good. Salmon wrap was more like a tuna fish salad wrap. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Yesterday was Veteran's Day and Burntwood Tavern offered free entrees to Vets. Not a \"select menu\" but ANY entree. This was one of the most generous specials I have ever seen because this place is pretty upscale. They were pretty busy because of this, so I made a reservation in advance. I was seated with my family at my reservation time and immediately taken care of. I noticed the servers we very busy and the manager was also actively engaged with the customers. They had complete control of the traffic at their restaurant.  Our food came out in less than 15 minutes, these guys were on top of the crowd. I had the Salmon BLT and my husband had the Asiago Chicken. My 2 year-old son had the Grilled Cheese. The kids menu very fairly priced, $5 for everything. Which is great when you wonder if you're kid will even eat his dinner that day. We were all pleased with our dinners, my Salmon BLT had an awesome taste to it.  We also had the dessert cups, which I recommend. They are $2.50 and a nice little cap to your dinner experience. Our bill was $10 because of the generosity to this restaurant to Veterans. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Over-reaching effort to be high end bistro. Extremely well trained wait staff. Nice facilities. Menu is basically high end bar food, poorly executed.   Came here for lunch. Were given 'brunch' menu. Lots of sandwiches with fried egg on it, including a burger. I had the burger. Meat seems like frozen patty. Very greasy. Not bad, but not great. Pickles had weird flavor. Daughter had Caesar with chicken. Tasted like frozen chicken heated and store bought dressing. Rest of food was just fair. Huge beer selection. Large bar.   More like a nice bar with above average bar food."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a different place. Bruntwood Tavern in Brecksville was the perfect choice! Had a Great evening with wonderful friends. Best to pair with Great Friends. .of course Great Food! Food, Beverages and Service! Can't  say anything negative, other than parking was a little tight. Will definitely be returning sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork chop. Was a little dry but the presentation was really good and overall flavor was very enjoyable.   Very nice atmosphere, had a very nice business lunch. It's definitely a place I would come back to, I'd probably just try something different."}
{"text":"It was just okay. One bad thing was we waited 10 mins at the host stand while there was multiple servers around serving other tables. Then we decided to grab some menus and seat ourselves which did luckily result in a server seeing us a couple mins later and they brought water but they made a comment about how we sat ourselves. The calamari was okay, the shrimp and tator tots appetizer were really good and the fried pickles I did not try but my friends enjoyed them. Our entrees were just okay. The steak and frites I had wasn't special. The steak was kind of tough to chew and the fries weren't anything to rave about. Someone else had ordered the Caesar salad which they said wasn't the best and then another had got the filet, prepared medium well but looked more medium rare but was good. One red door in downtown Hudson is similar but better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Service average at best, food was good. Kids menu ok.........NO DIAPER CHANGING STATION!? Seriously? Shame on the owners."}
{"text":"I came here for my first time with my husband and daughter. The employees/host were so friendly, gave us history on the restaurant, and even gave us complimentary champagne (fake champagne for me because I'm pregnant) to welcome us. We came for the happy hour. The food was delicious. We ordered a few appetizers such as the margarita flatbread, sliders, and chicken quesadillas. The service was great, server was so nice and attentive. The atmosphere is comfy, warm, and perfect for the cold winter. They had the fireplace going so it was a bit toasty but very relaxing. This was probably the best customer service I've ever experienced at an restaurant. We will happily come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! They have the best outdoor patio perfect for lunching! My fiancé and I went at a time where we could still take advantage of the brunch and lunch menu. We started with the buffalo chicken sliders. Omg! MUST HAVE! It's not a hot buffalo sauce, rather a mixture of buffalo and a Thai chili sauce! They were perfect!!  I also ordered a lunch pick 2 where I ordered a salad with balsamic dressing and a cod fish sandwich. The sandwich was pretty good and instead of regular tartar sauce, they add chopped jalapeños. Pretty tasty! The salad was phenomenal and a very decent size. I ate the salad and couldn't even eat half of my \"half\" sandwich.   My fiancé tried their speciality tavern burger with a fried egg, bacon, hashbrown party, etc... He said it was pretty good but I think it's fair to say that next time we will both get the chicken sliders (appetizer) and order fries!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this a fare review but I went for brunch today. I ordered the french toast and it had way to much Nutella on it. I am not a fan of chocolate so I did not enjoy what I ordered. I did not finish my meal as I felt sick from it being so sweet. I think the syrup was to sticky and sweet too. I'm glade there was the bacon to eat. The service was great. Atmosphere was nice and the place was clean. I need to go back again and try a lunch or dinner entree."}
{"text":"We eat at the Lyndhurst location quite often but this time we were very disappointed with the service received from the women who seated us. My wife and I visited at 4:00pm to a deserted restaurant except for a busy bar. She didn't ask where we preferred to be seated and took off to seat us at a high table in the bar area. I said we preferred to be seated at a booth in the restaurant section but she said they were short on servers and was trying to help them out and  proceeded to seat us on the otherside of the bar in a booth. I said this was not acceptable because it was too noisy and we wanted to sit in the restaurant side at a booth and asked why there was another couple already seated in a booth where we wanted to sit and was told they were leaving and then she proceeded to just walk away. A male server then came to our table and I said I didn't want to sit there and he asked where we wanted to sit and I said we wanted a booth on the restaurant side and he said no problem and so we changed seating and from there on everything went well and our male server took good care of us. The female  treated us like she could give a crap and totally ignored our requests. She  should be better trained or managment needs to get rid of her. Good service brings customers back to restaurants and bad service is costly."}
{"text":"We went for brunch as my wife wanted the Bloody Mary bar.  While prices were generally reasonable ($10 for three eggs, crispy potatoes, bacon, and toast), I've had better food quality at Denny's or Perkins.  I never send food back anywhere, but the toast and the bacon were cold--not that they weren't hot, they were cold.  The toast came out unbuttered and I had to ask for butter.  Of course, the toast and butter were both cold enough that attempting to butter resulted in...hole-y toast.  There were no salt and pepper shakers on any tables in our dining room, and the tabasco sauce brought out was less-than-a-half-inch from the bottom of the bottle--you wouldn't get this presentation in a cheap local joint.  The crispy potatoes were very, very good, but everything else was a letdown."}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is wonderful, with a great view of the river. The service was top notch & every employee that we had contact with was extremely friendly. The drinks are unique and very tasty. The food is delicious and the presentation is amazing. If you haven't been there yet, make a point of checking it out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for dinner and drinks.  I had the Tavern Steak and fries.  The steak was average but the Yucca fries and spicy dipping sauce were outstanding.  Luckily we arrived during happy hour (which they have every day!), and cocktails are only $5.  We had the cucumber margaritas and they gave us a nice strong drink for the price.  They also have a nice selection of beer and wine.    The service was decent but had that hipster aloofness which I can see being an issue when the place is crowded.    Nice bar and patio atmosphere.  Not my first choice for dinner, but I will definitely be back for drinks."}
{"text":"Very nice decor. Service was good.. alcoholic bevs took a little long. They were very busy though. Went during happy hour. Ordered a moscow mule ($5 hh special) & it was tasty. Appetizers on special so we ordered tuna nachos, zucchini fries, & a quesadilla. Try any of these, you can't go wrong. We split an entree; Asiago crusted chicken ($18) Overpriced in my opinion. You get 1 breaded chicken breast, small portion of potatoes, & a sprinkle of spinach & arugula. The dish tasted great though.. could have been more sauce on chicken though."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to BWT in Cuyahoga Falls this past Friday for lunch to celebrate my birthday. He ordered the fish special which was swordfish and I ordered the wedge salad and half California chicken sandwich combo. While the sauce on the fish was tasty, the swordfish was overcooked and my chicken sandwich was approximately a 1 inch paper-thin  piece of overcooked chicken. When my husband asked the server \"shouldn't you ask how I would like that cooked?\", she gave us a befuddled look as if the cook would not know how to do that. As for my chicken sandwich, the bread was at least 20 times the size of the chicken. I sent it back and apparently the cook gave the waitress a hard time and told her to tell us that they pound their chicken and there was nothing wrong with it. In any event, the cook tried to half-ass correct the problem and when it came out again, it was just as bad. The cook merely kept the same piece of overcooked chicken and threw on another overcooked paper-thin piece approximately the same size. It was evident that I wasn't going to eat the disgusting sandwich, so the waitress offered to see if she could take it off the bill. She had to ask her manager Matt if she could take the sandwich off our bill and she asked him to come over and speak to us. Our waitress continued to ask him several additional times to come over to our table, but he refused. Overall, while our server was tremendous, the chef's indifference to quality and the manager's inability to provide minimal customer service truly indicates that the wrong people are in key positions within the organization."}
{"text":"Yeah yeah, there's a river. Don't be lulled into complacency by the views. There are other riverfront restaurants in Akron.   Perhaps sitting at the bar for drinks is a different experience. We sat outside and had a lovely time talking and enjoying ourselves. It's a good thing we like each other because there is a LOT of waiting. When we did get food, it was incredibly salty - way over salted. My partner got the philly, which was on special, and it was incredibly dry. The waitress brought him some horseradish sauce to combat the dry, which was thoughtful. I got the avocado chicken flatbread and it was disgusting. Dry, salty, and way over seasoned with dry oregano. The \"avocado salsa\" was a thick paste with a distinct playdough flavor. I normally would have sent it back, but everything took so long...  Once we got the check, we placed the card down and watched the server talk to another server at least five minutes before grabbing it! When we left, we both felt like crap from the load of salt. Not impressed, probably not going back."}
{"text":"Disappointed in my most recent to Burntwood Tavern. I have been here many times and I hope this was just an off night. My mom was in town from Florida so we took her to dinner on Monday 5/15. I ordered the Nashville chicken sandwich, which I love and have gotten many times before. This time it came out served with coleslaw on it. I asked the waiter why it had coleslaw and he said it always did. It's not mentioned in the menu description and I have ordered it at least five times before. I sent it back and the waiter seemed very annoyed. Well it came back out and they clearly just scraped the coleslaw off and reserved it. To make it worse, they cut the serving of chicken in half. For $11 I got a half a piece of breaded chicken and a bun.   Like I said I was very disappointed. We have never had an issue here. I'll go back but I won't give them a second strike."}
{"text":"I live in Lakewood and have been searching for a good brunch place and I have now found my new spot! Went there with a group of 6 and the experience was fantastic!  They have bottomless mimosas for $12 that were great! (I recommend the standard orange juice, but if not definitely don't get the pineapple) Our waitress was awesome about refilling even before we were completely out. She was a doll as well.  The food, oh my god, on point! I got the breakfast BLT with a fried egg and it was incredible!   This place is HUGE so we had no wait at all which is rare for brunch in Cleveland.  Great staff, great food and great environment. Go check it out! I can't wait to go back for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"My first experience was great!  Great food and service.  The second time I was there we waited for 30 min. and didn't get waited on-we left.  Decided to try it a third time and had ok service, but when my meal came (the same one I ordered the first time), the pumpkin ravioli (5 ravioli) had no sauce on it!  When I spoke to the waiter about it he went to the kitchen and they sent out heated butter to pour on it!   The meal cost $18 and I was hungry after!  I would rather go to McDonalds, which I really deplore!"}
{"text":"We just left the restaurant and I have never had such an awful experience.  Let me preface that we have been here at least 3 other times and we have had good experiences in the past - Asked hostess if fireplace was on and if we could be sit there, we were sat 3 tables away from a non-operating fireplace - 3 servers walked by and never looked at or acknowledged us- no \" I will be right over\" (At this point we say- maybe we should leave??) - Hostess returns to our table to ask if we want to order a drink and we reply\" we are debating if we are going to stay\" and informed her that the others servers have walked right but and she says- I will fix this' -we ask for h2o's w/ lemon, hostess returns with 2 glasses of h20 no lemon no straw - Hostess walks over to our table to drop off an order of comped chips- greasy and flavorless - We ordered the French dip & fish sandwich- food served with no tarter, malt vinegar, or ketchup _ we ask for condiments x2. The prime rib meat was OVERLY hickory flavored and watery The fish sandwich was mushy and soggy  After sitting for 7 mins talking how awful our food tasted after 1 bite, shaking our heads in disbelief, and waiting for the hostess to return, I walked up to the bar and asked for the manager, the gentleman replied that he was the manager.  We explained how disappointed we were and he offered to replace our foods and we declined.  We just want to forget that this happened.  This is now off my \"in the neighborhood place\"."}
{"text":"Went there again and the food and service was just alright. They pack all the tables in so its loud and cramped."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. Had a very good live band and staff was great. Food was great and drink were just as good. Patio adds another star. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place has gone way downhill, my wife and I used to love having dinner here. Painfully slow service from start to finish. Waitress was nice enough but that's where the positive experience ended. Drinks took forever and entrees took about 40 minutes. My \"pork loin\" was way over-cooked and tasteless. My wife was served the wrong order. To add insult to injury, not a single person from the front of the house came to our table after our waitress said \"I'll send a manager to your table\". We're generally pretty easy going restaurant patrons, but when the experience is THIS bad, you get a Yelp post like this. At the end of the day, we will never go back."}
{"text":"It's like an Applebee's but with higher prices and not even at that level of food.  (shudder)  We were looking for a place to host an event and this would do - if only the food and service weren't so less than mediocre.   Won't go back - there are other places that offer value and class."}
{"text":"Great service, horrible food. Want to know how to ruin a soft shell crab? Go to this place. Imagine the thickest possible breading, deep fried, creating a shell casing that this poor animal tried to escape in the wild. Avoid this dish at all cost. Fresh soft shell crab, should be sauteed. I don't know if this stuff came from Chesapeake Bay in the last week, or if it's been frozen for 2 years. Does it sound like I'm fixated on this, yes? It's one of my favorite dishes, and they really mangled it."}
{"text":"My family and I went there for lunch last week, nice place, great views of the river, however it didn't cover up the poor food. I ordered tavern chips, those were good. I ordered the tavern dip- au jus , both cold., wife order seasonal  ravioli, no bread ,no salad offered cost $18 was supposed to lunch price of $13.,for like 7-10 ravioli's that's crazy! Daughter ordered fish of the day, which they were out of , and changed it to another, it was black- dry, it came with un edible brussel sprouts and a few other veggies. They chg $22 for that, they adj bill on hers after I complained. I didn't notice they screwed me on the ravioli . They said the computer changed the entered food to the dinner price they said, oops! Wonder how many ppl they screwed doing that , w/o getting caught. Gave 3 deserts for the complaints, oh boy! I don't know if ppl just except this at a restaurant or these ppl just think they can get away with this crap! Needless to say I will tell 10 plus ppl about the poor experience and food and I would hope they wouldn't count on the decor to sell crappy food and not use trickery at the register to increase tips and profits. I will never come back to your restaurant.  I had to enter 1 star but they earned 0 stars!"}
{"text":"Sometimes too noisy but decent food and fam friendlyish. Best tater tots ever! Great outdoor dining except when bands are too loud (and I'm not too old-just like to keep my concerts and dining separate)."}
{"text":"I've been to the Burntwood Tavern a couple times now. I love the exposed stone and the large fireplaces they have. It gives the ambiance of a very \"cozy\" feel. I had the veggie burger and thought it was excellent. It was cooked to perfection and with the arugula and tomato aioli on top, it made for a great burger.   The second time I went, I had the lobster bisque and sweet potato fries. Sweet potatoes are one of my favorite foods and I thought they were excellent here.  I would've liked a sauce on the side other than ketchup, but that's just getting picky. The soup was excellent and perfectly creamy.   Our server was great and very attentive. We didn't have to wait at all when we went on a late Sunday afternoon. They have a huge bar with ample seating. While we were there, there was a private party going on in the side room which opens up in the summer making for a great patio space."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised at all of the low reviews.  I live and work nearby Crocker Park, so Burntwood is a go-to for me.  The decor and atmosphere of Burntwood is excellent, from the cozy fireplace in the winter, to the elaborate glass chandeliers, and the wooden \"lodge\" feel.    The food itself has never been disappointing-- particularly during happy hour, which occurs even on weekends.  Their happy hour specials include 1/2 price apps, flatbreads, and various drink specials.  This is my favorite time to go to fill up on their signature tater tots (think big full tater tots-- not the dinky traditional ones).  The sauces that come with the tater tots are a delicious addition.  Their flatbreads are huge and will leave you with plenty to take home.  Mine was of a comparable size to a medium take-out pizza!  I've been here with my coworkers, boyfriend, parents, sister, and countless others.  The diverse menu has something for everyone.  The service has always been quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying that I intend to go back because I'm sure they can do better.   The space is warm and inviting, a perfect big bar for a cold winter night. There's a fireplace in the back half of the restaurant though the table closest to it is a communal meant for at least eight to 10 so your smaller party will not get too close.   We sat at an oversized table for two (which I love) next to a larger group (which I didn't love, they were loud). Our server was friendly, the beer selection pretty good and the food  menu enticing. I asked her opinion, roasted half chicken or cedar plank salmon? Salmon, she replied, she said it was delicious. She asked how I'd like it cooked, I said medium rare. I do not love overcooked fishes and found it interesting they'd ask a temperature preference. Anchor Steam Christmas Ales ordered, Caesar salad to start, off we go.  The salad was good, nothing fancy, just the right amount of dressing. Huge croutons. The fish arrived shortly after our plates were cleared and unfortunately, was nowhere near cooked to order. While tasty and I'm sure fresh, it was well done as were the sides of veg which included some asparagus spears and snow peas. Two veg, no starch? Hmm. The fish was tasty if overcooked but the veggies were just...sad.  We finished, ordered two more beers for dessert and were presented with the check without asking for it - boo. For two salads, two mains and four beers our check was just over $75 which seemed steep considering the quality.   With that said, I will go back and try a few other things because it seems like the food SHOULD be better and I really did like the space. Next time though, I'll request my veg be blanched or just sort of waved in front of a heat source, not order the fish and sit near the front where it's probably much less loud."}
{"text":"Bottom line, I wasn't impressed although I was really eager to see what the rave Yelp reviews were all about. Came here for lunch and ordered the club sandwich.  Seemed like a whole lot of boring on toast and the burnt fries didn't help the situation which cost $11.  Maybe dinners are better, but lunch was a fizzle."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible, stay away.   Complete waste of your money not even sure how this place can stay in business."}
{"text":"Visited this FINE place on the evening of New Years Day with my husband and a couple friends....I can only write this review in regards to the ambiance, staff and drink quality....We only stopped in for evening cocktails and not nourishment. From the second our friends took us into Burntwood and I walked into the building I was extremely impressed with the decor, lighting and overall feeling and ambiance. We were instantly greeted and offered a table or bar sitting...We chose to sit at the bar initially while we were ordering and getting our first round of drinks..I ordered the Jack and Jill which was a vodka based drink infused with blueberries and other fruit....It was tasty and definitely had me ready to order another one from the first sip...Our group moved over to a sofa and chair set that was placed alongside the bar in front of this great woven wooden wall! We stayed for a bit over an hour while enjoying another round of drinks and great conversation. If you are looking for a chill and relaxing no attitude place to go and enjoy conversation and either a beer from their plentiful beer selection or a hand crafted cocktail this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The brunch is delicious however there seems to be a disconnect with the service. All the workers are not pleasant and seem to be put out for doing their job... Took 7 minutes to have someone walk over initially and that was after saying something to the host. And then finished a drink and it sat empty on the table for 6 minutes before anyone decides to ask if I wanted another. Mind you, it was an early Sunday morning brunch and the restaurant was a quarter filled."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, good service, nice, good food.  Be prepared to empty your wallet if you want to leave full. I got two beers that were appearing to be 6 oz., I was thinking ok half the beer , half the price.... No. The pint I got was 7 while the 6 oz beers were 8 each! I asked about this and was told it was because it was a special pumpkin beer, which it wasn't it was an imperial stout... And it was bearly  an imperial ( over 8% abv) it comes In at 8.4 I think. Walked out at $94 getting a dinner two beers two salads and a bowl of soup plus tip"}
{"text":"Meh... other Yelpers said it best. It's not the worst, but it's not really all that great.   I ordered hummus and a Greek salad with chicken. While I know those things generally aren't exciting, I've had them done so well at other places. And for the price, I figured they would be fantastic! Nope.   The hummus was so bland, it was hard to taste it anything stand-out about it. Then it was served with bread-y, bland, wheat \"pita\". The presentation was just about the only thing nice about the entire dish. The salad was the simplest Greek salad I've ever had. I've seen them done really well (thank you, Souper Market) but this was not a shining moment.   The last thing I'll say is that we ordered champagne to drink, first they didn't have what we wanted on the menu. Then it took a good 15 minutes for her to bring out a different champagne. Not a glass, mind you, literally two mini bottles and two glasses. That does not take 15 minutes in real life.   I'm sure there are some delicious menu items, but this trip and my other experience at a different location did not show me those items. Womp Womp."}
{"text":"You know--I've been putting off this review for a while now just because I don't really have any feelings about this place, which might be a negative to some. But when it comes to Burntwood Tavern, I can't lie--I could take it or leave it.   My Mom and I ended up here about a month or so ago for lunch after some shopping. We were actually going to try Hunan on the Falls, but it was empty and that freaked me out. So, we hopped next door to Burntwood. I had heard OK things about this place in the past, although I hadn't realized how many locations there were...   The Yelp reviews sort of say it for you--some people love this place, others aren't impressed. Almost to the point that it's about half and half. The decor is OK, but something about it and the quality of the food makes you feel like you're in a large chain restaurant.   We started with the flash fried zucchini, which was about the best thing we tried. They were seasoned perfectly, fried to a crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside. We then had the soup of the day, which was a spicy chickpea soup. I'm a big fan of salt and this soup was definitely salty. So much so that I could see how some folks might not like it because of that fact. The flavors were good--but it tasted like a crockpot soup my grandma would make from a recipe on the back of a can. It was homey, but unimpressive. Then came the biggest flop, which was their Philly cheesesteak special. I loved the cheese whiz (the ONLY way to eat a real Philly), but the bread and \"Steak-Umms\" tasted straight out of the freezer. The steak was thin cut, and prepared like an O'Charley's Steak Sandwich out of the mall food court. It wasn't horrible, but not something I expected from this place. Maybe from the drunk menu late night at a hole-in-the-wall bar.   The service was just OK--It was basically the bartender stepping out to serve us, splitting her time between them and the dining room. In my opinion, you should have a dedicated server and bartender, separately.   Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but I wouldn't cry if a bunch of my friends wanted to go here."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Worst server ever!!!Maddie was here name. She never read specials and had no clue what they even were. She completely forgot our appetizers. And kept making excuses manager came over with a lame excuse as to why.  It was all just bad. I work in the service industry and they should be ashamed. We frequent this location and honestly .....I don't think we will ever go back."}
{"text":"It started with the Hostess' attitude.  We had reservations but we're early.  We were told to wait at the bar.  When I pointed out there were no seats, she said\"well it IS first come first served\".  We ended up sitting in a booth in the bar anyway once the table was \"ready\". Steaks were not great.  We both ordered medium rare.  One was well one was very rare. The drinks were the saving grace.  Service was very slow .  Not worth a trip back."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, tasty drinks, food is better than the norm, and good service.  Overall, a good experience. I got the asiago crusted chicken and it was ok. The Pear of Cucs specialty drink is pretty tasty, though!  A great mix of refreshing cucumber but just the right amount of sweetness.  Definitely recommend it. We also tried the Neapolitan Stout - yum!   A great place to try a few times a year, but would get stale after too many visits."}
{"text":"My husband, myself and another couple went here today on the recommendation of a coworker. There was a 50-60 minute wait, but we were seated in about 30.  I was inpressed by the interior decorating which consisted of a rustic look of old wood from barns with barn sliding doors.  Our waiter Tim, I think was British, was friendly and was very knowledgable about the menu.  He was an excellent waiter and the reason why I gave them 3 stars.  Pretty much our appetizers and entrees came out we either cold or tepid warm & we were constantly sending our food back to the kitchen. For appetizers my husband ordered  chicken quesadillas.  The presentation was nice, it reminded me off those steak towers from applebee's, but it was warm not hot.  Myself & my friend ordered the calamari & it came in a half brown paper bag.  Unfortunately, the calamari was ice cold. We sent it back and all they did was throw them back in the grease. When it came back out they were greasy, overcooked, & chewy.  Our other friend ordered kettle chips w/ gorgonzola cheese and bacon. They were cold. The entrees didn't fair so well either.  My husband ordered an asiago crusted chicken sandwich with fries.  His sandwich just warm, but his fries piping hot.  The other gentlmen of the group ordered Philly cheesteak w/ fries.  Both just warm.  Finally, my friend and myself both ordered the cedar plank salmon w/ sugar snap peas & asparagus. The salmon was hot but the sides once again cold.  We sent our entrees back.  When they arrived my peas were now piping hot, but my salmon was warm and asparagus was cold. My husband spoke with the manager Marco who listened to our complaints and was apologetic and willing to rectify the situation. We weren't looking to have the bill reduced we just wanted to let management to know our concerns. I will assume because it was extremely busy the kitchen probably couldn't keep up.  I'll give them the benefit of a doubt cause everyone has an off night. I'm willing to give them one more try just not on a Saturday dinner night, LOL!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour has some good deals. The bartender was busy and running around and forgot my silverware and napkin, even after waiting 25 minutes for my appetizers. Which is a fine amount of time for food to come out. It is just annoying to ask for a napkin. Good beer and food though and the service was overall pretty good. Let's see about next time."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed Easter Brunch at the Burntwood Tavern C-Falls. Service was amazing and the food was next level. My favorite thing was the oven roasted tomato coulis on the meat table. Packed with freshness and flavor. They were very busy but kept service moving and Lydia our waitress was uber professional. Will definitely be returning!! A must dine place for foodies."}
{"text":"Both my co-worker and I ordered the prime rib sandwich. Yeesh...big mistake. It made me physically ill to try to eat it. The manager happened to come by and ask how our meal was. I could not say it. I could not say it was fine. He even urged me to be truthful. I don't think I explained it properly when I said the meat was gross because later he came by and told us he spoke with the kitchen about trimming the meat better and that prime rib is typically a fatty cut of meat. It wasn't the fat, you want a little buttery fat to go with a prime rib sandwich, it makes it more delicious. It was the gristle, the huge amount of unchewable, nasty ass gristle. I tried to pick my way through it, but it was not possible. The horseradish sauce on the other hand was delicious as were the fries. And, they do have a great burger. The manager made my day by writing off the lunches. I would have been very sad to pay 12 bucks for food I did not eat. He also offered to have something else made for us but we were having to get back to work.  We've been to this place a couple of times with various results. I'm trying to give them a fair shake as they are newer and so damn close to work. The servers always seem to start out great, then go AWOL.Today they were  introducing a new menu (meaning the prices have gone up, yay...not)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have become fans of the happy hour specials and we enjoy the comfortable atmosphere. Service has been great and the food has been excellent. Love it!"}
{"text":"Burntwood has been a wonderful experience. Until now. We stopped in to the one in Crocker Park tonight. Ordered chicken marsala, and to say it was bad is an understatement. The staff is wonderful. Jen our waitress was great, and the manager seemed concerned. But the food was wrong, bad to even terrible. If you want poached chicken with cold potatoes and improperly prepared asparagus, than this is your place! Otherwise, stay away until management gets a cook that knows what he's doing!"}
{"text":"Recently visited this establishment with family and friends for a birthday dinner, food was just ok, not seasoned(burgers, fish) I ordered the fish and chips dinner, received a large portion of fish that was over cooked in the fryer.  I requested tartar sauce a total of 6 times before the waiter bought me some, but it was horseradish by mistake.  Save your money and your taste buds"}
{"text":"We arrived around 8pm on a Thursday night and were able to sit at a comfy booth right away.  I was impressed by the renovated design inside, especially the stacked wood wall.  Our waiter, Matt, was super knowledgable of the drinks and food options and was able to steer me to a delicious IPA.  We ordered the artichoke dip for an app--amazing.  We also ordered the filet and the porkchop for our entrees and both were outstanding.  We were super impressed with the atmosphere of a live guitar/singer, ambiance, food, helpful staff.  We will definitely be back.  Sidenote:  I lost my earring in the booth, and when I went back, a waitress was easily able to get down underneath the table and found it.  I couldn't have been happier!"}
{"text":"SO far I like this place. The interior is really nice. Lots of light wood, dark colors, kind of rustic interesting decor while not screaming for attention, felt calm and relaxing but doesn't feel manufactured like a chain restaurant. Some booths and tables, private areas that would be nice for a larger party, and a bar inside and out. Oddly I really like the lighting fixtures.  On our first visit we sat on the outdoor patio. Its covered and you can see the TVs, there are nice lights, and although it  overlooks the parking lot, it definitely doesn't feel like you're still in Solon.  I found the service to be friendly and attentive. Its still new to this town and the bartender is trying to learn everyone's names. He recognized us from our 1st visit which was nice.  The drinks were good, but pricey. I'm not a big drinker but they had several beer and wine selections that I recognized. The seasonal selection was something with peanut butter in the name, not sure what it was, but it was worth a try. I like the mixed drinks but they go down almost too easy! Still packed a punch though, just pretty smooth on the intake.  Food was good, so far we have tried the calimari which was average, battered and fried with a ho-hum sauce. Good but not exciting. The fish and chips were very good. Nice crispy breading on the fried fish. I had tilapia on another occassion and it was delicious but the sides were lacking. Very small portion of a squash dish and they really need help on the presentation. It just looked thrown together. The food does seem high quality, no complaints there, but may need a few months to really get it together. Plus, it is not pricey! But they do have happy hour daily with food specials.  Now, the wait times can be ridiculous. On our first visit, it was a Saturday evening and they quoted us a 90 minute wait!! So we sat at the bar, which was fine, you can order food there too. Later we came during the week after 9pm and it was not at all busy.  I'd highly recommend the outdoor patio, really enjoyed it and spotted a few Solon celebrities (we have a few). I will say this place seems to attract an older more gentrified crowd than families or college kids, probably due to the pricing.  Really liked it and look forward to going back. Truly think it will improve in a few months and get a 4-5 star rating."}
{"text":"Excited to have a culinary forward local chain here in ne Ohio. The prices are a little steep for what you get. My ahi tuna nachos had 9 chips. Portions are small, but overall good food."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location, normally go to the Crocker Park location for happy hour.  I found the drinks were a little weaker and the peach in the sangria wasn't the same.  We always get the firecracker shrimp they're my favorite.  We feel like we didn't as many as we normally get at the Crocker park location.  Also the breeding was falling all of them.  We also got the green beans and the shrimp tacos.  They were good.  Overall I would of given and 3.5 for the food and drinks only because the food at other location is awesome.  The outside seating however I would give a 5!! Love all the seating!!"}
{"text":"Tend to only go during happy hour which is awesome! Half price apps (fire cracker shrimp are to die for) and $5 cocktails.  We tend to sit at the bar and the ladies are nice and will let you try all the beers to find one you like.  Tends get a little loud on a Friday night.  We will got back for sure.  We have also been to other locations and this one is our favorite as far as drinks and food"}
{"text":"Love the location and the building . Ordered the veggie wrap that was listed as having lettuce, tomatoes, pickled red peppers, black beans, and mushrooms w a side of sriracha aioli .  What I received was a cold burrito with lettuce , tomato , and a few red peppers- the weird part was that the black beans were mashed together with rice - cold refried beans and rice mixed together. I  didn't see any mushrooms , but it was dark , and I was hungry - didn't want to cause a stink with the group I was with so I ate part of it . This would have been better server hot with cheese or something . Our server was great , and so were the drinks . I'd come back again ... JUST DON'T GET THE VEGGIE WRAP !!!"}
{"text":"Went in, not knowing they are only serving their Mardi Gras menu at lunch M-F. Today is the last day for it and, being Sunday, I was pretty disappointed. The waitress said she would talk to the cooks and, when she came back, she said they would make what I wanted anyway, off menu. Daughter had the crawfish cakes and I had the gumbo for our apps. Loved em. She had the Crawfish Caesar Salad and I had the Jambalaya for our mains. Loved em. Never waited for a drink, food came out relatively fast and the waitress was very nice. Maybe my 4th time at this restaurant but this time they went above and beyond. Go, now."}
{"text":"Freaken burgers with eggs? GENIUS!!!!!  Burntwood burger was sloppy meat coma inducing goodness!!! My peoples were in awe of me as I slayed that burger like it was my job!!! Came with handcut ff and I simply plowed through... So why not 5 stars?  Kinda screwed the pooch on our marketing directors salad...But still 4 stars means... GO NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was just ok. Service was great but the food was not memorable. Nothing really stood out or would cause me to go back. If in the area we might go back for a second chance."}
{"text":"Just ok. Nothing really jumping out to come back for. Shrimp tacos were good as were the chicken sliders. Mac-n-cheese was cold, so I sent it back. They did bring me a hot dish. It tasted like Stouffer's Mac n cheese. The side of tater tots were doughy. They would be better off serving plain old tater tots. Service was just ok to slow, beer was cold! Reason to come back? Maybe to give it one more try?"}
{"text":"This is one of my wife and eyes favorite watering holes. It's a cozy environment and the staff is always friendly and very informative. Great place!"}
{"text":"Clean that disgusting patio floor with raw sewage leading to the side patio entrance by the disgusting dumpster next to the building please-so gross its totally ridiculous-also wash the patio and floor if you are going to leave the side  door open by the patio gross-pure black disgusting to think you are cooking food in there-you must know people who work for the city not to be cited ==sickening dirty"}
{"text":"On Labor Day night, not many places are open so this was an excellent Yelp find.  There are apparently several Burntwood Taverns in the area, but this location hadn't been listed on yelp yet.  A great place, spacious, yet inviting.  While the lot was filled with many cars, we were seated immediately, with no reservation. My wife chose a steak salad, and I chose a Ceasar with a Margarita flatbread.  All was great. Angelina, our waitress, offered a great dessert presentation...we'll have to go back on a future trip. We like it."}
{"text":"service is always exception, food is excellent and the restaurant is gorgeous! great for lunch and dinner, have special Bloody Mary bar on Sundays that's wonderful! I always recommend."}
{"text":"Upon my first visit I was quite impressed with Burntwood, as it was a beautiful autumn day and we quickly got a table out on the patio (not to mention, it had opened just days earlier).  It also didn't hurt that Happy Hour was still going on (runs til 6:30pm) - which translates to $5 martinis and $3 draft beers. The most memorable food item ordered on this occasion was actually the appetizer, as I remember being drawn to the zucchini frites - which ended up being light and delicious.   There have been several visits after - many of which have been with my parents b/c Burntwood quickly became a favorite dining spot of theirs.  Although, during these visits, I began to notice a few setbacks - mostly coming down to the fact that their menu is limited and slightly boring.  I do enjoy the decor, which is warm and cozy (lots of wood, hence the name) and appreciate the prompt and knowledgeable service.  Just an observation, but it's no surprise that my parents love this place - they fit in with the rest of the clientele which is primarily in the 50-65 year old range.    Also of note - parking was initially an issue, but many customers complained and valet is now offered."}
{"text":"Not sure why I haven't checked this place out before, but I was mostly satisfied with what I got and will be back to try more! Here is the lowdown:  Tavern Tater Tots ($10) - homemade round tots with an artichoke fondue. Not bad, but I was unimpressed as this dish seemed plain to me and I would probably not get it again.   Blackened Shrimp Tacos ($12) - You get three in an order and they aren't very big, but they tasted good.   Avocado Chicken Flatbread ($12) - They did a bad job of evenly putting the toppings on, but this was pretty tasty and I would definitely get it again.   I got the food to-go so I can't really speak too much on this, but the place seemed clean and the bartender was friendly. There are some other tasty sounding items on the menu that I want to try, and the appetizers are all half off during happy hour so definitely a great deal if you are looking to try a couple things. I will be back!   ***Update I really like the french dip $13 with blistered asparagus instead of fries. The spinach and artichoke dip $10 with pita bread is great too."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent.  The pretzel bread is a tasty appetizer.  I had the Mahi Tacos and a side of ranch.  The tacos were delicious and the ranch is incredible.  Come see Allie and Doreen at lunch and get ready to be spoiled.  Excellent place to eat at after a long day on the road."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio for a two hour dinner on a Wednesday night. Half way through the night we were told that there was a computer error and our order was lost. Not from our server but a bartender. We remained positive until our served asked if we wanted dessert and coffee........prior to our food being delivered. There was a never an apology or acknowledgement of the terrible service. We will never return. There are way too many better options in the area, let alone across the street.   The manager did rounds on the patio but somehow missed us. I guess that is a normal night at Burntwood. Please avoid this location."}
{"text":"While I thoroughly enjoy the food at Burntwood, this is the 3rd time in the last couple of months that we have been to this particular location and had horrendous service.  Previous visits have had been rife with slow service and inattentive waiters, however, our recent visit took it to an entirely new level.  We sat, unattended for close to 30 minutes before finally flagging down the first person that would make eye contact (after several other attempts to flag down servers) and let them know we had not even had a drink order taken.  We ended up giving our entire order at once which consisted of nothing more than a couple of appetizers, 2 house salads, and a children's pizza.  Drinks were forgotten about, the appetizers took over 40 minutes, and when they finally brought the food, there was no children's meal (every parent of a 3 year old's worst nightmare).  They apologized for forgetting the pizza, blaming it on poor handwriting and promising to have it out as quickly as possible.  After we had finished our meal, the kids pizza had still not appeared, again more apologies that it had been burned and they were making another one, meanwhile my child asking repeatedly why everyone else at surrounding tables had their food and he didn't have his.  Finally a pizza was delivered long after his interest in eating had passed (about 90 minutes into our \"leisurely meal\").  I don't know if this location just needs more staff or better trained staff, but we probably will not be back again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night, and it was pretty busy for a weekday night.  I used to frequent this location back when it was \"Chag Town,\" and it's pretty trippy to see the new interior.  I like the bar/lounge area.  Anyway, back to the meal...  Service - our server was nice, but the big glitch of the night had to do with one of the salads served to our table.  When it came out, the plate was hot.  It was sent back, and she returned with a new salad fairly quickly.  However, this one had brown lettuce in it, and should never have been served.  It was also returned and taken off the bill.  Drink - beer selection is decent.  Love the Left Hand Milk Stout on draft.  Food - other than the salad debacle, the rest of the meal was solid.  I had the Au Jus dip, and I substituted tater tots for french fries.  Everyone else in my party seemed happy with their meals, too.  Overall - not the worst option for a nice meal, but not my first choice for a night out."}
{"text":"I've been to two other locations and had up-and-down experiences.  My recent visit at this location was better.  The biggest issue was at our arrival, as the hostess disappeared and did not check in with us for a few minutes.  I'm certain she saw us, but was preoccupied with something else (not sure).  Once we were seated, however, things improved.  Friendly server, decent beer selection, and my meal (prime rib au jus sandwich) was pretty good.  The tots, of course, are money.  Not a bad dining option if you're in Crocker Park, and the location (across the street from the movie theater) is very accessible."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening...place got busy while we were having our meal.  Menu has decent variety of American fare, and some fun apps.  The tots, as mentioned by others, are very different, and quite good.  Calamari was average, homemade chips pretty solid.  I ordered the Burntwood Burger, which I enjoyed.  However, I could do without the hash brown patty.  Beer selection was nice, too.  Enjoyed a couple Left Hand Milk Stouts.  Don't know that we'll be back, but it's a solid dining option in Solon."}
{"text":"The food needs to catch up to the great atmosphere.    I ate at Burntwood Tavern during happy hour on a Saturday.  I picked this location for its rustic design, vaulted sealing, cabin in the woods like ambiance, and warm fireplace.  I really felt like I spent the afternoon on a getaway in a cabin in the woods or at a ski-resort lodge.  It was relaxing and calming, truly a healing experience.    When we arrived shortly after four in the evening the parking lot was pretty full. \"Ugh!\"  We entered the front door and I saw that everyone was packed into the bar area :)  I breathed a sigh of relief :)  A few parties sat in the dinning area.  The hostess sat us far enough away from the beautiful fireplace that I thought I wasn't going to be able to enjoy it's warmth, but it's heat reached us even three tables away from it.  (I wondered how hot the fire felt sitting near it).  The waiter must have been new because he didn't tell us about any specials, the menu wasn't very familiar to him, and something just didn't seem right.  I watched and listened to the waitress serving the table next to us and sure enough she rocked it.  Yep, this guy must be new.    I ordered the Burntwood Burger and my company ordered a burger as well.  The bun was horrible.  Sorry, it was.  I don't like to say it, but I need to.  The bun could have been the cheap buns you buy in bulk for picnics--they fall apart easily on the burger and are dry.  The chef cooked the burger according to my order.  The meat, however, was lacking in flavor. (The next day I ate a leftover burger from a well known restaurant that blew this burger out of the water with its flavor and perfect bun). The fries were delicious!  And the presentation was picture perfect.  We followed up the main course with desert.  I loved it there desert.  I love it because the serving size is a small glass--just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. Their 5 selections of deserts are varied enough to ensure that someone in your party will find something they'd like to try--and you won't feel bad for eating too much!  That's a plus.  One con, other than the burger.  The tables wobbled.  I witnessed one family move to another table because the slant of their table was too great.  Our table wobbled, but just enough so that we only had to be careful when we leaned on the table.  I think my company spilt my coffee a few times.  I hope you enjoy the ambiance and other food items."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, especially in the summer. Good variety of menu selections. I had the swordfish steak with grilled vegetables which was very good. The service was excellent as we were waited in and assisted by multiple servers. Would definitely recommend this bar/restaurant to anyone looking for a great casual night out!"}
{"text":"Convenient and very friendly staff with delicious meals & wonderful cocktails. The atmosphere is definitely lovely. All in all a great place to enjoy dinner after work or on the weekends."}
{"text":"UPDATED FROM LAST REVIEW:   MY RATING SYSTEM:  1- I will never ever return! 2- Okay, Meh. 3- Good, but my mom's is better. (lol) 4- Amazing Experience, will be back! 5- I am blown away, Bravo!   Service: 2/5 Food: 1/5 Price: 4/5 Menu: 3/5 Location: 5/5 Wifi: 0/5 Atmosphere: 5/5    Overall: 3  Breakdown: We were seated fast. We had a nice server and  I ordered Tuna Tacos that were bland. I also ordered the asiago crusted chicken which was BURNT! Unhappy! The waiter didn't even take the Tuna off my bill even though I sent it back after taking two bites.... UNPLEASED!  Final thoughts: I liked this place on my first visit, the food was good.. but because the menu is so/so and I didn't have a good experience this time, I won't be back. See updated photos:"}
{"text":"Once again fantastic they made my son feel special for his birthday.  Chef Brent made us the up and coming crawfish cakes that will premier January 19 !!! Mind you im not one for crawfish but holy cow they were so delicious blew me out of the water.  I recommend them !!!!!. Our server Sean was so funny and social he took his time with us and get to know us we got to know him. I havent met a server i didnt like so far . Guys Go to Burntwood Tavern  tour gonna love it !!!!! Once again thank you Chef Brent and our server Sean"}
{"text":"They either need to do something better or something cheaper. There isn't one thing on the menu that I'm like yes this is the best in the area, something I've never tried,  something Ill come here specifically for. There are too many places to get okay food at a decent price so why would I want to get okay food at an expensive price. Love the decor and great drink specials. Service was great but extremely slow for getting food, and we were brought the wrong food, twice. Food seemed like they were trying to max profits. The asiago crusted chicken sandwich had chicken that was 1/8th of an inch thick with about 6 polka dots of cheese, smaller than dimes and 4 pieces of arugula."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for pretty average. Love the decor and the atmosphere. Would prefer a 10 dollar app to come out to be more than 6 tator tots. A 20 dollar entree should be a little more than something I can make at home. Dessert menu is limited to 4 shooters to choose from."}
{"text":"My first experience was amazing. The female bartender asked my name and then from there everyone called me by my first name. Amazing. Went back the next night. I had a male bartender he asked me for my drink order and never came back to take my food order. I waited  25 minutes. I guess he was more interested in the 4 women at the other end of the bar.  Never going back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely unimpressed. Ordered an item off the daily menu: chips and queso blanco. The plate was nearly empty with barely any chips on it. And the chips we had were stale. So embarrassed wth my guests here.   Waited for 30 minutes for a water. That about sums up my experience. 30. Minutes. For. A. Water."}
{"text":"I went to the Burntwood Tavern in Solon to meet an old friend.  It looked like a chain (possibly because of the sleek menus and robust architecture, more likely because this location lives in an old Max and Erma's.)  There are five locations in Northeast Ohio, but it is hardly an Applebee's-type institution.     It was just before Christmas, so it was crowded, and we had a 20-minute wait.  Fortunately, there is an inviting bar as well as comfy chairs around a roaring fire, so our wait was comfortable and flew by. The hostess came and got us when it was our turn.    We had a great waitress, Amy, who was very patient with my friend and I as we caught up, having not seen each other in years.  We each got a glass of wine from the slightly-above-average wine-and-beer list.    I started with the field greens salad, which was far better than I expected -- good dressing, toasted candied pecans, and feta.  Per the Yelp rave reviews, I opted for the tuna nachos for my entree, and they were great!  Lots of fresh ahi tuna, and avocados, atop crispy wontons. I was glad I'd gotten the salad as an accompaniment, because the appetizer portion wasn't quite enough to stand alone as my dinner.    All in all, I was pleasantly surprised.  Burntwood Tavern doesn't have a ton of character or originality, but the food tasted good, the waitress was great, and it was a comfortable setting for catching up with my friend."}
{"text":"What a great space! Unfortunately, the only thing missing is a great restaurant. I struggled between 2 & 3 stars, but if I'm being honest, 3 stars means good, and Burntwood Tavern just wasn't all that good.   I was in on a Saturday during their brunch hours (11:00-3:00 Saturday & Sunday). I decided to order from the brunch menu and selected the Nashville chicken biscuit with crispy potatoes. Three chicken was ok, but not what I would consider \"Nashville Chicken,\" the biscuit was a tad burnt on the bottom (there's a pun there somewhere), the gravy was pretty standard, and the potatoes were well beyond \"crispy.\" The service was decent, although a little slow, but no real complaint there.   All-in-all it was just a mediocre at-best experience. I don't think I would return, which is a shame given the grand stature of the dining room itself. I know I may seem to be a bit hard on the chains, but I call it how I see it, and Burntwood Tavern was a swing and a miss."}
{"text":"The bowl comes out and it's neon orange, I'm thinking what did they bring me, but after one taste I realized oh that's the lobster bisque, a bit spicy but pretty darn good. Good California chicken sandwich too, strangely one side was well toasted and the other side a bit soggy. Service was ok, little slow, our waiter was boring but the hostess was nice. $10 for soup and half sand which is a little much, but prices are going up everywhere. My friend got the Brentwood burger which looked awesome. I've had the burgers at their Solon location and always enjoyed. It's strange to see the old champs remade but was nice inside -- I always hated seeing the kitchen and now it's walled off. The place could use a couple more tvs with such a large bar area, but I get they want a more intimate feel -- hard for such a tall open space. Overall would recommend, would rate 8/10."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour.  The wait staff was really focused on friend and regulars... which is great if you are a regular... But I watched half the bar wait too long and be ignored several times."}
{"text":"I have given Burntwood 3 chances to win me over.   In a nutshell, if you're looking for mediocre food and service with a nice cocktail and an incredible view, make your reservation now.   The ambiance, the views, and the overall design are wonderful. The cocktails, wines, and beer selection are also nice. And appropriately priced.   Where they have lost me every time is both service and quality of food. The service has been ok. Never horrible, but always just mediocre. But, the server knowledge on the food and products is absolutely terrible. (Perhaps I've just had bad luck all 3 visits?) I know that this is partly a management/training issue so I won't fully fault the servers. It's incredibly frustrating when I ask simple menu questions and they can't be answered. Or I ask you flavor profiles of wine and you're clueless. This is the perfect opportunity to find someone that does have the knowledge to send over or to find the answers for me.   The quality of food has always matched the service as well. Mediocre. Ahi tuna nachos that are 95% chips, a crab cake eggs benny that was on an UNtoasted English muffin with a broken hollandaise, lukewarm Belgium waffles, and the list goes on.   If you simply want to have a drink, Burntwood would be fine. But the second you think you may want something to eat, I'd check out one of the other 5 places in walking distance.   I would give them 2.5 stars if it would let me."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  I live in the area and was really hoping for a great dining experience.  Not so much.  Like other reviewers I found service to be very poor.  From standing in the lobby waiting to be acknowledged by the 2 staff at the lectern to not knowing where the hell our server was.  Food was OK.  A coworker went there and when I asked her how she liked it she told me when they were seated they were  told their table was reserved at 6.  Well it took so long to get their food they were actually told by the manager at 6 to leave when they hadn't even finished eating!  I have NEVER heard of such a thing in my life.  Wanted to take my sister here but from recent reviews I see service  has not improved.  Too bad cause it is a nice building in a great location for me.  I live right down the road from Tinkers Creek Tavern.  I'll stick with them."}
{"text":"I wanted to sample everything that was ordered at my table, it looked so good! We shared the tavern chips and they were tasty.  I had the chicken cheese steak, and I would definitely get it again! The others entrees at my table my friends raved about were the prime rib sandwich, flatbread pizza, and the cuban sandwich. They give you a lot of fries. The service was good in that, without asking or being told she split the appetizer among the bill and the checks so we didn't need to explain. I thought this was observant and thoughtful. I left full with no complaints!  Also, take advantage of the complimentary valet parking."}
{"text":"I have been to the Burntwood tavern on several occasion. The wait staff is pretty good and the location is very nice.  Other than that the food is not very remember-able and the bartenders are not very friendly or helpful. The only thing they have going for them is the view and nice happy hour prices."}
{"text":"What an awesome place to stumble upon.   My boyfriend and I wound up here when all of the town square restaurants were packed during Blossom Time. Beautiful, rustic decor. Inexpensive (for lunch at least) high quality food. I really enjoyed my gazpacho. I didn't order the tater tots, but was envious of all of the tables around us that had. The calamari was light and crispy as calamari should be. The service was attentive without being overbearing."}
{"text":"The food has been good the last few times we dined here. Based on that alone it would get 4 stars, but the service is atrocious!!! We won't be back and I recommend you dining at another establishment. Being a bartender at a high end restaurant I tip very very well but when the girl takes 8 minutes to bring two waters (yes, 8 minutes for 2 waters... No lemon, no napkins, no side plates) then another 12 to bring just the vodka for the Bloody Mary bar which was almost completely empty just like the previous attempts at this bar... The upscale attempt this place is going for becomes pretty lackluster. We asked the waitress if they were going to fill the empty mason jars containing the add ons which bring people here (seeing as our vodka and ice was almost completely melted together by this point and we didn't order vodka and water) she said \"yeah... They will\", then continued to talk to the two two guys at the table next to us for another 10 minutes. So an older gentleman (we suspected was the owner) filled the empty mason jars. Drinks were great after that ( a bit watered down seeing as we had to wait so long) However, we didn't see our waitress for another 15-20 minutes and by this time, we didn't even care to eat here. So as we were looking for our makeup caked waitress, a waiter comes up and says, \"I'll be your server\" ummm... This place pretends  to cater to a more upscale crowd, but if you expect service, bring a tight affliction shirt and a basket full of wet and wild make up. Maybe you will get a drink within 30 minutes that way. If you have an hour for two drinks and horrible service, check out the burnt wood. However, if you expect a pleasurable dining experience, look else where. Blue jean clad jersey shore waitresses and watered down vodka with an empty \"Bloody Mary station\" does not add up to a pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"Love the decor, the patio is perfect and our wait without reservations has never been too long. Love the pumpkin ravioli and sweet potato fries. Valet guys are so kind and all of the staff were kind Service is usually consistent, friendly and attentive. Only drawback is there isn't anyplace to wait during a busy evening, except near the bar which is very loud and not very easy to get a drink but the bartenders are friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to Burntwood and thought it was fine.  But Rocky River?  Seriously. Ew. There were gnats flying around our table and my beer glass had lip prints on it.  My friend's wine glass was spotless but the bowl her salad came in had grease smudges on rim.  Waitress was really responsive but our appetite was ruined.  I'm going to chalk it up to a fluke and not give 1 star because I've been to another Burntwood and had a pleasant enough experience. Really cozy decor and the waitress was fantastic but PLEASE clean the place."}
{"text":"You take the good you take the bad..the facts of life..that was my experience last night at this establishment. We had a 7pm reservation for my friend's birthday. When we walked in we all liked the looks of the place. The decor is very nice.(good) We walked up to the hostess stand where there was a smiling young man to greet us. He was friendly enough but unbelievably clueless. He forgot our name writhing 2 seconds and then scurried around like he had no idea what he was doing. ( bad)When we finally got seated we thought the craziness was over. But no..our server came right out and admitted to us that she had no idea what she was doing..with confidence waning, we ordered drinks and dinner. A member of management had heard it was our friends birthday and we were brought complimentary champagne..( good) when the food came, it was a split decision..I had the asiago chicken, it was great. 2 of my friend's ordered the French Dip. Neither one of them got the gravy to dip and it took awhile to get it. They both said the sandwich was disappointing. Undercooked and tasteless is what they said.  When we wanted a second round of drinks it took forever( bad). I know with places that are new there are kinks to be worked out. I am giving this place the benefit of the doubt and would try it again. One last thing to note..the tables are made from wood planks. Be prepared for your drink glass to drip in between the planks when the glass starts to \" sweat\". One of our friends legs got very wet from her glass dripping on her all night. Overall I would recommend this location. Just be prepared for a bit of chaos while they polish their act."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but the food wasn't. Went for Sunday brunch as soon as they opened and they were out of the house smoked salmon. Disappointed we ordered the prime rib egg Benedict. If you're going to offer egg Benedict you should know how to cook it right. One of the eggs was hard boiled, the entire dish was barely lukewarm and the prime rib was a piece of deli roast beef. After an hour wait I wasn't about to send it back, but I also won't be going back.  The best part of the meal was the hot, crispy seasoned fries that come with some of the kids meals."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch after a Saturday of errands from the east side of Cleveland to Youngstown and back.  Great stop!!  Walked in - no waiting.  Service was immediate and superb.  Had the house Chardonnay with appetizers (Tavern Chips, Hummus) and our tired bodies immediately began to relax and enjoy the deliciousness on the table. Food (sandwiches) was served not-rushed but timely and warm.  A couple hours later, we were more than satisfied and on our cellies raving to friends and family."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The service was great. Our server Jill was so friendly and attentive. The food was good. One of us didn't care for the fish dinner and the manager came over and asked what was wrong with it, apologized and took it off the bill. I think his name was John. He was also very friendly and truly cared about our experience at his restaurant. We will be back."}
{"text":"I enjoy almost everything I've had here. My wife and I live nearby and get togo from here. I'll order our food and have a glass of wine or a draft beer while I wait. There are always great selections from both. Bartender Marcus always takes care of me."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Great solon location amazing live music with a tremendous open air patio bar. The service has dropped the past few years. The food is consistent but so is the below average service. We actually enjoy the chagrin location much better service same good food."}
{"text":"Boy was I pleasantly surprised by this place.  Whenever there is a new, trendy, busy restaurant with long lines I am wary.  So I wait for the hype to die down.  This is a really nice place to stop and eat with friends.  Decor is eclectic and trendy.  So is the sound track.  Menu is diverse.  They have brunch on Sunday AND Saturday.  Nice.  We stopped for lunch.  Menu prices are good for the quality and portions.  The tuna nachos are very different and good.  Think ahi tuna on fried wontons with guacamole.  Service was just a bit slow, even though it was not crowded.  Worth a return trip to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Interesting place.  For as long as I can recall, the building was home to the Spanish Tavern.  Never went there.  Went here for a late Saturday lunch.  Trendy decor, with the signature light fixtures and chandeliers seen at their other locations.  Nice menu.  Found out they do change it seasonally, based upon what produce is in season.  Good drink menu.  Cucumber margarita is amazing, but unfortunately will be gone for the winter.  Nice appetizers.  Calimari was fresh, lightly breaded and flavorful.  Tomato and mozzarella basil salad was large and tasty.  The smoked pork chop was juicy and flavorful.  The desserts are interesting and small - you could not handle a large dessert after most meals.  Server was friendly and attentive beyond words.  Would definitely recommend and will make a return visit."}
{"text":"Great looking building, helpful wait staff, The fish Sandwich was huge and great tasting my buddy said and the Mr's had the Salomon which she said was very tastey and filling. I had the PASTA. DO NOT ORDER THE PASTA UNLESS YOUR STOMACH IS THE SIZE OF AN ANT, They barely give you a handful for $15. dollars , the sauce was good BUT they don't even give you a crummy slice of bread \"EXTRA EXTRA\" I found out You just get a small bowl of pasta..    For the money got for the fish or Hamburgers they are good size portion. The place fools you into thinking its a classy restaurant but in fact it's a classy Hamburger joint"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to dinner there last week and it was amazing. I wish we had found this place sooner. We decided to get a couple appetizers to start. First was the Tavern kettle chips topped with gorgonzola, garlic, bacon & green onions. These were really good, but the star of the show was the \"Tavern Tater Tots\". They were less like tots and more like little pieces of cheesy Nirvana deep fried and served with tomato aioli, chipotle bbq & peppercorn ranch dipping sauce. All the sauces were good, but I loved them plain. For the main dish my wife choose the prime rib, which was a featured dish that day. It was cooked almost to perfection....she ordered it medium, but it came out a little rare, which was fine. They said it was 16 oz., but I bet it was pushing 18 oz.+. It was a massive steak.  I ordered the Filet, which is a goto for me when ordering steak. It was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor and was so tender. You need to check it out and you should see if you can sit in Lydia's section. She was knowledgeable, helpful and funny. She will do you right."}
{"text":"The service here is great, and the food is always top notch quality. The only complaint I have is the high prices for their dinner menu... The happy hour with half price appetizers 7 days a week can definitely help you avoid that though. They have sliders, lobster ravioli, and shrimp tacos on their app menu, all large enough to consider a meal.   Overall I think Burntwood is perfect for groups of friends getting together to share some appetizers and drinks. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Burntwood has become my favorite place to visit when I'm home visiting my parents in Chagrin Falls. The happy hour is the best in the city, with $5 cocktails and a bounty of half-price appetizers, each one more delicious than the next. My personal favorite appetizers are the shrimp tacos, the calamari, and OF COURSE you can't go to Burntwood without having tater tots. Those things are life-changing. The beer, wine, and cocktail selection is also pretty top-notch, and with their happy hour deals M-F from 4-6:30 (I think?) you really can't go wrong!  As for entrees, my favorites are the soup and sandwich combo or any of the salads. They all have very unique flavors, and you can tell that the chefs put a lot of time into coming up with the combinations of ingredients. The brunch selections are also very good, and fairly priced (about $10-$12). Also the bloody Mary bar where you can choose all of your own toppings is so much fun! They even have fancy toppings like shrimp cocktail! Overall, Burntwood is definitely a hot spot in Chagrin these days, and rightfully so. I think it will be around for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Burntwood Tavern  always a solid. The music was pretty loud so we had to move into the other room, unable to converse. Place was pretty busy. We took our drinks into the other room and our new server was completely cool, brought us waters. I had another adult beverage because I felt bad for our server ; )"}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time, after I had a doctors appointment at Metro, in the same complex.  Really cool interior, friendly staff. Our server Mary Ann was great, she was training a new server at the time. She informed us of the happy hour food and drink specials, perfect timing.  We enjoyed the prime rib chili, tator tots, and a flat bread pizza, plus a dessert. Got to meet the Chef, as we saw him on tv a previous night. will come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Do not go here for breakfast! Wait in line at First Watch. The Brunch we had last Saturday let us know not to ever go back for breakfast. Wife sent back her food twice. The coffee is only fair. When they brought the food they dropped it off without checking if anything was missing. We thought the server would come by and check. No, after several minutes of trying to get attention of anybody, one server said they would get our server. I like there lunch but DO NOT go for Brunch."}
{"text":"What happened to Burntwood Tavern?  My husband and I have eaten at several of the Burntwood locations throughout the past few years.    To explain my rating let me first start off by saying that although the restaurant had many patrons, it was by no means \"packed\".  We waited maybe 8 min for a table for four and when we were walked back to our section, there were several empty tables around us.  It took our server 15 min to even acknowledge us. No \"hello\", no \"I'm sorry, I'll be right with you\".  He never once told us his name, instead acted distracted and disinterested in being there.  Our friends ordered two waters and two sodas.  He had to be reminded twice to bring the water.    When our food came out he dropped our plates off and immediately disappeared never asking if there was anything else he could get us (which at this point my water glass was bone dry).    Our nameless server never returned to our table to ask how everything was.  As far as the quality of the food, we were underwhelmed.  My flatbread (which I have ordered before) was unusually salty and it appeared that the kitchen staff dumped a heaping piled of powdered Parmesan cheese on top.   Yes one big mountain in the middle.  This was NOTHING like it was before!    Lastly, as a former server, I have a very good understanding of a servers responsibilities and what is and isn't their fault.  Often times I pitty servers who are receiving the brunt of complaints for the kitchen.  However our experience tonight was largely related to our service, secondly the food.   I sincerely hope this was a fluke as I was most embarrassed to have our friends there for the first time."}
{"text":"Party of three, our bill was $100+.  What a disappointment.  A surprisingly beautiful 65 degree night in rocky river drove us to look for a great patio casual dining experience nearby.  Unfortunately the patio was closed off to the open air but fortunately it was compensated by a fantastic bluegrass band performing live near the bar.  We ordered an appetizer of firecracker shrimp which was just ok.  It was buffalo wings style.  For entrees we were satisfied with the filet with white cheddar Mac n cheese and steak salad but the chicken Milanese was not good.  The big disappointment was the drinks.  We ordered wine and two different cocktails.  The wine was watered down and we politely questioned our server about it.  She took the glass of wine to the bartender who apparently said \"I opened a new bottle and poured\" so our server simply came back to the table WITH THE SAME GLASS OF WINE I SENT BACK!! unreal.  No apology.  We didn't touch our drinks.  The Moscow mule was awful so he ordered a margarita.. it was undrinkable not to mention that our drinks took at least 10 minutes and it wasn't even busy.  I took a picture of our full drinks that we paid for.  Our server was \"sorry\" although we were not visited by a manager and nothing was comped off our bill. I think she was very nice and well intended but very poorly trained.  Taking into account the considerable competition of great places to dine in the area, I sincerely hope that BT will take a look at their bar service and wait staff and implement some changes."}
{"text":"Took my mom back to Burntwood Tavern this afternoon and this experience was totally different.. I came away really impressed with the manager and the waitress and help that waited  on my mom and me as well as the food this time  We had some difficulties the prior time that we were there.. This time we met the manager, he greeted us.. gave us a real nice table. real competent waitress waited on us.. very efficient.    I made sure we ordered the salmon well done for my mom, nice thick piece of salmon came out on a wood plank.. really nice cut of salmon and cooked perfectly.    I know in my business I am not always perfect even though I do strive for that.  If I am less than perfect I try and make it up to my clients.. Every business can have hiccups, it is how the business deals with those hiccups that can stand out... The management really went over and above the call of duty to make it up to my mom and myself and the food today was excellent.  I have a different view of this restaurant now and the management, a very good view, and hope to take my mom back there again."}
{"text":"Just walked out of the place. The guy singing was was shrieking so loud it was excruciating. No way you could eat and talk. Bad idea."}
{"text":"Yuk - husband and I both ordered  angus burgers well done.  Whatever seasoning was added gave it a nasty taste and food was undercooked.  Fries were loaded in salt! Went there on Labor Day, not busy yet service was poor. We will not return."}
{"text":"Sorry, not for us.  Too pricey, too little. I work too hard for this place. The view is wonderful, the staff is ok."}
{"text":"Our family recently had a birthday party here Saturday night and wow we were impressed! The staff truly went above and beyond- it was well worth it and will be our go to spot when we are in town. Thank you for making the night so great!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, cool architecture and good food. The lobster bisque was amazing. Fish & chips was good but didn't care much for the jalapeño tarter. They have hand cut fries that are great too. Overall, nice place and would come again!"}
{"text":"This is still a \"go to\" destination for lunch.  Food is delicious and service is friendly. Menu offers choices for all.  It is easy to understand the popularity and reason why it is able to open other locations."}
{"text":"I have been sitting here at the bar for 14 minutes and counting and have yet to be acknowledged by either bartender. Yet, those customers with a vagina are getting a great deal of attention... and we are at 15 minutes..."}
{"text":"This was our third time here. We kept going back so that we could understand why this place gets so crowded. Is it the atmosphere? The valet parking?? The lovely view of route 21 from the patio dining? It definitely can't be because of the service. The service here is ridiculously horrible and the food is different but not excellent. My husband and I came here for appetizers and drinks. After 40 minutes of waiting we still did not receive our appetizers and only had one drink. We finally decided to call it a night.  We went up to the bar to pay for our drinks and explain our situation to the manager (21 yrs at best) she took our money and and gave us a minimal amount of cash back (which I did not realize until we were long gone) so I'm assuming we ended up paying for the appetizer. But the strange thing is is that we never got a bill she just gave us whatever change she decided to give us.  It doesn't look like three times is a charm for Burntwood."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at the Burntwood Tavern. Visiting my Grandpa who's recovering from an illness at the Weils, we wanted to take him out for dinner and Burntwood seemed like a good place. I'll start with the hostess who took our reservation - absolutely wonderful. My Grandpa is wheel-chair bound and when explaining the situation, the hostess said that not only was the restaurant wheelchair accessible, she could make sure we had a table with easy wheelchair access for him. Awesome! Next, arrival - it was super easy to drop him off at the door, park the car, and head in to our assigned table. Then the service: our server, Sarah, was great. Not only did she patiently repeat the specials and offers available, she helped make a custom meal for Grandpa at no additional cost. The atmosphere was great and family-friendly, not too loud on a Saturday night at 5:30-6pm! Cost was reasonable, too. Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I only went for drinks, but it was a great experience. Sitting on the patio overlooking the river was amazing! They have a wide mix of different drinks and beers. Thanks to our awesome server, Josh, I found my new favorite beer: Kentucky Peach Barrel Wheat Ale. Josh took the time to chat with us and make sure we were comfortable with our selections. The only semi bad thing was that they close kind of early. We never felt rushed out. I'd like to go again and try their food and use my rewards card that I picked up. The decor was amazing as well inside."}
{"text":"Excellent service and atmosphere. Had the chicken asiago for dinner ... Tater tot appetizer Yum."}
{"text":"The interior is so nice.  Looks like something from a renovated Kitchen impossible episode.   The food was so tasty.  We ordered the margherita flatbread...fresh and delicious!  We also ordered the burnt wood burger...amazing.  hubby had the Asiago crusted chicken meal...also amazing.  Ordered the apple strudel type dessert....perfect size...delicious and only 2.49!  Our server was attentive and always bringing us refills (not big on alcohol so iced tea/soda refills)  and checking on us.  We loved it.  My only complaint was that we are a childfree couple and we were surrounded by kids...for the most part well behaved kids but I sometimes wish we could sit somewhere away from the families with noise makers...you ask not to sit by kids and they look at you like you have an extra head.  All in all...great.  can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Over priced, okay food! The decorations are nice though but would not waste money or time going back"}
{"text":"Nice drink selection, and a good deal at happy hour. The flatbreads are tasty and the pork wings are good too!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Do yourself and make a reservation. We didn't and we waited 30 minutes for a table on a Saturday night at 5:30. There wasn't even a place to sit and wait at the bar which would tell anyone that this place is THAT GOOD! The food was outstanding. The calamari was lightly breaded and not soaked with grease so it was really delightful.  The Cedar Salmon was perfect. My date enjoyed his pork chop: thick, juicy and super moist...he just wished there was a larger serving of the sweet potato fries-yummy! Another table had the wedge salad that looked phenomenal and the prime rib looked like it would melt in your mouth. The only constructive feed back...the noise level was loud so it made it difficult to have an engaging conversation...maybe an acoustical fix. Regardless if that we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had such a wonderful experience and I love the atmosphere. The food was to die for! The little desserts were so cute and a fantastic idea after eating such a large meal you need a little something sweet after. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Worst night ever at Burntwood!! So we have probably dined here at least 50 times and are, obviously, fans. Under most normal circumstances, this place is a solid 4 stars. Last night, however, was one gigantic clusterf***! Everything was just awful: service, food, vibe, etc. It was the kind of night that could seriously cost them long standing customers. Had this been our first visit there would never be a second one. Very long wait to be seated for our \"reserved\" table. Probably 15 minutes before our server came by to ask about drinks. Since it took so long to get started we also ordered apps along with our drinks. When the calamari came (which has been quite good in the past) it looked as though someone had dumped a box of calamari-like crumbs into a basket. It was also not the least bit hot. The blackened shrimp tacos, which I have had sooo many times there, because they are really good, tasted totally different than ever before. there was no apparent blackening and the only discernable flavor was a VERY sweet sauce that I don't recall ever having. Our server, I forget her name, seemed VERY frazzled and impatient. Our dinners arrived all separately with the 4th one finally showing up as the first diner was finishing. The same thing seemed to be happening all around us as many other tables were loudly complaining to their servers and the managers. we will certainly be back, as we have had very good experiences there in the past, but this was as bad a night as any decent restaurant could likely have."}
{"text":"I have been to Burntwood plenty of times and they have yet to disappoint.  I LOVE the atmosphere.  They have a fireplace with comfy couches, an enclosed patio so you can use it for ALL seasons, and delicious drink specials.  The food!!!!!  It is so delicious.  I have had the salmon sandwich, salad, and deep friend zucchini.  I really want to try EVERYTHING on their menu.  This place is not only a great place to eat and drink- but their staff is one of the nicest I have encounter.  I highly suggest checking them out for happy hour and for dinner."}
{"text":"Really nice place nice happy hour easily accessible from the freeway my only concern is the waitress kept saying the word axe instead of ask which is a little irritating"}
{"text":"Amazing service!!!!! Our waitress was honest and open about the menu items when we asked for her recommendations. The Jack & Jill drinks were delicious! I highly recommend the Sicilian Flatbread, prime rib Chillin, chicken avocado flatbread, and chicken sliders! The manager was accommodating and generous when he sent over complimentary champagne to our table."}
{"text":"Went here last night to try it out. There was a 30 minute wait but we found seats at the bar. This place has a really cool atmosphere, nice cooper bar.   They have a good beer selection, a few seasonals and local favorites. No Oktoberfest though which was a little disappointing.  We started with zucchini frittes which was served with a two sauces, one sweet/spicy and one smoky.   Then moved on to the smoked pork chops and the scallops, both were excellent.   This is a great addition to the restaurant scene on the west side."}
{"text":"I stopped in for happy hour with a few friends. We started with an appetizer of tavern chips and they were delicious! I would definitely order that again. I tried the avocado chicken flatbread (which was half off for happy hour) and loved it! Huge portion, enough for a meal the next day. Service was a bit slow to refill drinks but the food came out quickly. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Yeah, just placed an order via uber. They held our order for 20 minutes. Then cancelled it and are now saying they're closed and no longer delivering.   Not cool!! We won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"My family ate here constantly when it first open - our overall favorite - the Smashed Potatoes! We LOVE them! I've had everything from the flatbread pizzas, sandwiches, to steak - all are very good! The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the Moscow mule - which I normally love!   Nice atmosphere and good food! Finally a restaurant that will stay for the long haul in this location! (FYI - this location has had many diff names in the past 15 years - none lasted - Burntwood will!!)"}
{"text":"Came here with a few girlfriends for brunch on a Saturday.  We forgot to make reservations so they said about 15 minutes, well we were seated immediately.  It was a nice day so we sat outside.  The patio area is really nice and I like how if it rains you can still sit outside under the tent that goes over.  I ordered the \"Welcome to the Combine\" half caesar salad and half asiago crusted chicken sandwich.  The meal was delicious and came out quickly.  Our waiter was nice and checked on us frequently.  I definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to place!  My boyfriend and I had reservations for 3:00pm on Saturday.  We were running late and they were ok with it and were extremely friendly.  It was happy hour so we ordered sliders and chicken wings (wow, both were fantastic).  I had the asiago crusted chicken sandwich (my favorite) and my boyfriend had the steak, asparagus, and potatoes.  He said the steak was delicious, but the asparagus was a tad salty.  Our waiter had asked if we were there for a special occasion and we were there to celebrate our 4 year (we didn't even tell them when making the reservation).  The owner came back with two glasses of champagne for both of us!  We were so excited and couldn't have had better service and food.  Ask for Josh when you go...he's a great waiter, he gets to know you, and is extremely friendly.  For drinks, apps, meals, and dessert it was only  60 dollars!  Best restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"Good food with great happy hour prices.  Half off appertizers and $5 drinks (plus othes discounts) was a great value.  Decor is very rustic or lodgey and it was very hot today so didn't check out the back outside area but looked nice from my quick peek in.  I ordered Tuna nachos and chicken quesadillas that were good.  Quesadillas was the stand out.  I've had better tuna but also have had worst.  Last thing that I ordered was their house special tater tots, which I didn't finish and regretted ordering.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Great bar and restaurant that occupies where champps was at crocker park.  Sat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon. Fantastic and friendly bartenders waited on us almost immediately. Their happy hour specials were outstanding. Half off all appetizers, five dollar signature cocktails and specials on bottles of beer.  The campfire martini was awesome, especially with toasted marshmallows that accompanied the drink.  We ordered two appetizers. My wife had the prime rib chili. It had huge chunks of prime rib in it. Great dish.   The tavern chips were equally as good topped with gorgonzola, bacon and scallions.  Would definitely recommend this tavern to anyone."}
{"text":"Once upon a time there was a magical pseudo-English place here - \"Pub\". It had a very nice atmosphere, good beer but most importantly - boys in kilts. What do we have now? Good beer is gone. So are the kilts. Instead I and my Russian girlfriends have 50+ fully dressed  (thank God) men checking us out and  some sour wine with generic calamari.  And yes, I might not remember the food at the \"Pub\" because my focus was elsewhere, but nevertheless I want it back.  No we want it back. Kilts, mass-produced portraits of royal family and did I say kilts? Until then - we are boycotting the place. Amen."}
{"text":"For the quality of food and the way it's prepared, the cost is not worth it to me.    As with all the other burntwood taverns in the area, it was beautiful inside, and this one overlooks the river.  The service was less then par.  Calamari app is good.  Zucchini Frite appetizer was very good.  The house salad is very good. Iced tea is good.   The cedar planked salmon w/tomato vinaigrette was ok and I wouldn't get it again. If u had a bite w/the tomato vinaigrette it was good, if u had a bite of just salmon, it was bland!  No seasoning or anything... A little dry on those bites as well... Couldn't even finish.  Another person in our group got the chicken philly sandwich and they enjoyed it. Another person got the flat iron steak which he said was good.  The tavern tater  tots that accompanied the steak were like wads of dough over tots or something... I did not care for them, the 2 guys at the table said they were fine to eat like 1or 2.  Other food I've had here in the past: The asiago crusted chix sandwiche was ok. It had fresh mozzarella on it and a nice juicy piece of chix but it lacked in flavor, was ok but I like punches of flavor. The Ruben was very good but huge! We got the half sandwich with salad and we still had to bring 1/2 of the 1/2 home!  went again and I got the salmon spinach fetachini and it was sooooo delish I would Definetly get it again!!!! Hubby got the prime rib and he was not a fan, it had a huge smoky flavor to it. I thought it was ok... But he said he would never get it again. The Long Island ice tea was good and I really liked the tko martini, it was an cinnamon apple vodka w/vanilla, and graham cracker crust.... Mmmmm  If I do go back to any of the burntwood taverns, it would b for drinks and apps. Not dinner entrees."}
{"text":"Great food and cocktails.  Awesome view of the river. Friendly staff. Can't wait for there second location to open in Fairlawn."}
{"text":"Ive' had a few meals there because of convenience. If you like to people watch, this place is OK. The bar service was way sub par, the prices are a bit high and the food generally sux. Our table was near an area where we could see (and hear) just about everything. Some Manager was generally rude to servers on this, and about every other visit we've had. Heavy set, dark skinned guy acts for like a bouncer at spelling bee. Just pretty full of himself and has no f'ing clue what's going on.  I had a steak there that was OK, they've screwed up simple burgers, sides, dinners,  twenty minutes to wait with an empty beer glass before ASKED if I wanted anything else! Screwed up checks. Chilly night, heaters by tables outside (nice) but freezing at outside bar! I got there a few times early (like 5 ish) and there were tons of parking spaces... NOPE... Can't self park. Gotta use their valet. I don't care that it's free... Still gotta tip and the space is a few spots from the front door.  BIG turnoff! Snobby, annoying and loud hostesses just like a cold wet towel.   I gave the place plenty of tries and am convinced that they are successful in spite of themselves. Got to know a few servers there, they complain about poor treatment by management. Anyone who gives this even a 3-star is just enchanted with the area and decor.    Better food in same area at Raintree and Gamekeepers... For the money that Burntfood charges, we always get much better service and food at other area places. Burntood is WAY overrated. Oh... the fries were good. Calamari was tough and greasy. Of the three burgers I've had there, they got one right. House Cabernet is fair.  We're done and can't figure out how the place is still in business."}
{"text":"I went to the Burntwood in Cuyahoga Falls last night. I was meeting a friend, at the bar, for happy hour. I arrived first and got a seat. The bartender asked if I knew what I wanted or needed a minute to decide. I opted for a minute to decide, well that minute turned in probably 5 to 7 minutes before he could make his way back to me for my drink order. He then proceeded to make at least 8 other drinks, change out his sink water, and still hadn't started my drink. I sat as patiently as I could but then as he started making other drinks again and my visit was approaching 20 minutes without a drink I figured they really didn't want me there, so I left. Oh I forgot to mention there were two bartenders and neither could be bothered to make my drink. So I'll be crossing the Burntwood off of my list and The Office will be getting more of my money."}
{"text":"Set upon the raging Cuyahoga River in an old mill (or something), the Burntwood Tavern has a balanced vibe of unpretentious but upscale atmosphere, a wide array of customers from all walks of life, and a diverse menu that can please a all tastes - whether we are talking food or alcohol selections. The service is friendly and welcoming (as first-timers, we were even offered glasses of champagne). This is the type of place where you could have an amazing reception for a baptism or rehearsal dinner, or just have a memorable time hanging out and eating appetizers while watching the game on a Sunday afternoon. P.S. Do yourself a favor and get the tots!"}
{"text":"Burntwood just opened at the site of a mexican restaurant that went out of business.  The service and the food was very good.  Fan favorite of our group was the Flash Fried Zucchini, Cedar Plank Salmon and the Apple Crostada for desert.  We will be going back again soon"}
{"text":"Come for a drink, a great atmosphere, and a fun menu, but keep your food order basic. Though the flavor profiles they aspire to with some of the Features are commendable, the cooks (I will not call them chefs) botch simple things like undercooked veggies and overcooked meats. But a sandwich? You're fine.  Still the best patio restaurant in Solon!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour selections! Our server Jennifer was friendly and very informative. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A favorite for happy hour. Yummy drinks, good service, bangin' Shrimp and homemade tater tots appetizers.  Spicy Siracha shrimp tacos good too!"}
{"text":"Happy hour daily is great,food is very good and the staff is better then most .Complimentary valet parking is a joke,Witness kids speeding in parking lot on several occasions and running out in front of cars. Also hsrd the kid complaining about insufficient tips.If someone wants to park there own car they should let them.Belden village Burntwood has better food and better parking arrangements . However the river view on front street is very pleasant."}
{"text":"Great menu. Great food. Very reasonable prices. Our favorite.  We live in Chicago but are in Cleveland regularly to visit family. Most restaurants we've been to have served mediocre bar or deli food or are chains we have near home. Burntwood offers a unique menu, fresh tastes, terrific food, good service, and prices at least 1/3 less than similar places in Chicago. We've tried both Chagrin Falls and Solon and loved them both - wish there were one near our home."}
{"text":"Great food,  great service and nice cozy atmosphere. We have been to several of their locations and each time we were seated promptly, with server coming over with first couple minutes.  Menu is on point. Everything is delicious from the starters all the way to the beer selections."}
{"text":"Excellent service excellent food ambiance  very friendly and warm.  Tuna nachos are really very good as was the asiago chicken with the spinach salad ."}
{"text":"Looking at Burntwood, you'd think \"this must be a really interesting place\" with the old theater signage on the outside. The decor inside is woodsy and unfinished in an appealing way. I've had some great cocktails here, and the beer list is respectable. They've hopped on the Bloody Mary Bar train for weekend brunch (Bloody Marys must be the official drink of Rocky River, I swear) and also offer an entire gluten-free menu. The food holds promise too; if the dishes were well-executed with quality ingredients, I could look past the somewhat uninspired menu. But the problem here is consistency. I've enjoyed the zucchini frites in the past, but have also had completely flavorless calamari. We came about a month ago for brunch and the eggs on my benedict arrived to the table cold, and then this past weekend the eggs on my breakfast pizza were perfectly cooked and seemed to have come right out of the pan. Service is another mystery; every waiter/waitress I've ever had here appears completely exasperated. Not to say that they aren't friendly, because once they get around to the table they've always been pleasant but that's usually 5 to 10 minutes after being seated. Not sure if they need to hire more people or the staff just need to be managed better, but something is definitely lacking. I can recommend stopping here for a drink, but I would be anxious sending someone here for a meal because I can't guarantee they'd be satisfied."}
{"text":"It's not looking good for Burntwoocd Tavern. Though the decor and atmosphere is gorgeous, the food and performance were not. The waitress and manager were really unprofessional when we walked in. They kept on telling us our table number. The manager didn't know who was waiting our table, and made that very clear by saying \"I don't know who's waiting on you. I guess you'll find out.\" We waited about 30 minutes for our food. Just when we thought it had arrived, we were wrong. We were brought the wrong food twice. We saw 4 meals being sent back to the kitchen. Our waitress was hiding in the kitchen. She wouldn't come out onto the floor. I had to find her to ask for more water. When our food actually arrived (about 50 minutes later) the burger had an uncooked egg on it. Couldn't find our waitress, so we brushed it off and ate. The manager dropped by and we told her about the egg. She was professional and took it off the check. Had to poke my head into the kitchen to get our bill.    I'd like it if they would call me when they go under, because I'd buy some of that wood and those chandeliers."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Food was delicious!!  Great service!! We had a Spicy shrimp for appetizer.   Great flavor!!!  My husband had fish and chips which he said was the best he's ever had.  The fish was light and the batter was perfect and flavorful. They add a special homemade jalapeño tarter sauce which he said was amazing and complimented the fish perfectly.  I had their special gumbo and a chicken sandwich,  both were very good.  Everything came to the table very fresh and hot.  Also our server Marisa? was extremely attentive and helpful.  I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Visited the Chagrin Falls location first for drinks and then the Solon location.  The bartender was vey friendly and helpful; she kept the conversation going throughout lunch.    The portions were perfect and I thought my appetizers were spot on.  My favorite is the tuna nachos."}
{"text":"I have tried 3 different locations and want to like this place so badly but just can't. The atmosphere is fantastic. I love the rustic decor and hand blown glass centerpieces. The food is just average at best and I wish wish wish it was better! This time I got the beer battered fish. The fish was ginormous. They sure didn't skimp on the portions! But the fish was so soaked in oil it was just disgusting. I couldn't even eat it. The jalapeño tartar sauce was delicious. And the sweet potato fries were just okay.   The service left a lot to be desired. We waited 20 minutes for our cocktails. We had to ask for refills on our pops and waters. The server delivered our food and never came back. I needed a refill on my water but she was no where to be found. Just really disappointing. I've tried this restaurant three times and I'm just done."}
{"text":"From the outset, our waitress spent way too much time making small talk.  We had to \"hail\" her to our table several times because she disappeared for long stretches.  When we asked to hear about dessert options and it took so long for her to bring them (over 20 minutes) that we decided not to order dessert.  She added an extra entree to my bill.  The food was just \"OK\", except my husband's burger was dry and over cooked.  Also, his utensils were filthy when he took them out of the napkin.  The Burntwood in Solon is nothing like this and has been a very enjoyable dining experience every time.  I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the Burntwood Burger and it was delicious! I went during lunch time and we got great service. We sat outside in their nice, open patio area. Great place!"}
{"text":"I called for reservations for 8 people. They were very busy but accommodated us. When we arrived 3 other colleagues joined us for a total of 11. Burntwood was totally flexible. They smiled and said that they would work it out and they did. The swordfish and salmon were excellent. They have a great selection of wine and excellent draft IPAs. There appetizer potato tots were outstanding. I have been to four of their locations. They all have been great but this location is one of the best!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a group of six. We made reservations for six-thirty and we had drinks at the bar until we were seated about seven.   For appetizers we had calamari, tater tots and blue cheese and bacon chips. We really didn't wait very long for the apps to come out.   Luara was our main server but occasionally she was helped out by other staff. Luara was very pleasant and efficient. I had Swordfish with mixed vegetables and a salad. Everything was prepared perfectly. Others in our party had fish n chips, cedar plank salmon, Swordfish and something on a bun. I wasn't paying attention : )    There was live music and he was very good. It wasn't too loud so we could all carry on a conversation.   This is a perfect location especially if you have a large party. I have been to almost a the Burntwood locations and this one is the top 1 or 2."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner Friday night with several friends (6).  The valet guys were very helpful as there was limited parking because Burntwood was very busy.  The food was very good and everyone enjoyed their meal. For dessert I had the Toffee Brownie. Great end to the meal. The service from Jaclyn wasn't very good. I don't know if our table was out of her main area because we were treated as an afterthought. When I sat down I ordered a Jack n Coke. I never received it. I asked again later on and Jaclyn said that she would remake it.  That confused me. Service was slow and cumbersome. She would refill some water glasses and not others. Random. Great restaurant but not so great service."}
{"text":"Not the best service, and NOT GOOD food. For the price, it is not worth coming here. It is on the river though, which is nice."}
{"text":"Stayed with friends nearby, and we happened to show up at this Burntwood location at 4:45 PM...and that was the best move of my day.  Happy hour goes from 4-6 PM every day at Burntwood, so that means that all apps and flatbreads are half off, plus there are a ton of drinks available for $5 or less.  So, for $40, we got five appetizers and a kids' meal plus two cocktails.  Yes, sir!  The tater tots, calamari and shrimp tacos were all great; the chili was only OK, and the zucchini frites had promise but are a bit too shoestring to effectively put into one's hands to eat.  A strange problem, but a problem, for sure.  My daughter's fish and chips meal was great and I \"helped\" her finish the plate.  The signature cocktails were fine, but not special.  I'd show up again the next time I blow through town!  Service was generally good and very accommodating for my two-year-old's food needs.  However, the tables (which are massive in size) are a bit too low--or maybe the chairs are too high--to figure out using a booster seat in these conditions.  Also--there is no changing table in the women's restroom (I didn't look inside of the stall in the men's room) so that forced us to get a little creative in this space, not ideal but we made it work!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a glass of wine and late night snack. The snack (prime rib chili) was ok but the service was great. Annetta was great, her smile is warm and her service is above par. She is the reason I'll be back!    Colin, the manager, has something going on too; he seems to have a sincere interest in his customers and it shows."}
{"text":"The experience was not pleasant. The tavern was nice inside- interesting mix of casual and modern decor, plenty of space, and fireplace gave warm ambience.  However, Chad and lady who were welcoming guests were not doing well their job. We waited for our table for 45 minutes. Every time they promised that table will be ready in 10, 5, 15 minutes. The most what upset me that two guys were seated faster even we came first- they didn't have reservation too. Also, there often were 3-5 open tables that just needed to be cleaned. Instead of cleaning tables and faster accommodate their guests, the welcoming staff made us wait...  Finally, we got our table in the bar area. I understood that place was busy, but waiting for the waiter, food, dessert was forever...  the food was plain- I couldn't say that something was extraordinary. However, I will complement selection and taste of desserts.  I don't want to return and I think there are plenty of other nice restaurants!  Ps. I feel bad for the owners of the place. Welcoming staff can ruin someone's business in the same manner as incompetent waiter or cooker could."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends there a few weeks ago, it was a bright but cool Sunday we walked right in and were greeted pretty quickly seated right away ( place was empty)  I selected an appetizer of calamari.....they salt it !!??   The server was gracious enough to offer another  order but I said I would pay I just didn't expect them to salt it, that's a first.  I passed my heart attack  platter to rest of the table and my healthier calamari arrived quickly.   The fun ended there :(    I guess I'm the chronic complainer because I ordered the $24 steak  cooked med. and WTF they cut it up !! This wasn't a slice to inspect the level of doneness (is that a word?)   but darn near the entire steak was sliced up so now my whole meal is cold !   I stopped have mommy cut my  my steaks once I turned 18, so why is the cook cutting up my $24 steak ?   I had to inhale the steak because it wasn't that hot when it arrived  and I knew it'd get cold fast,   and for 24 bucks, it was kind of  small ?     I may give them another shot but won't get the steak!!"}
{"text":"Table for 5 on a Friday night ~ unimpressed with the quality of salmon on a plank (small portion and tasteless); salmon fettucinni (unappetizing appearance); calamari (greasy) and Caesar's salad (salad was warm!); the crab cakes appetizer was delicious & the chicken looked the best  The band is too loud and cheapens what little atmosphere the place has - reminiscent of a local hullabaloo.   Kudos to the waiter who brought out glasses of champagne for each of us and toasted the gal who was celebrating her birthday that evening!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and turn around time. Definitely a go to, for a wonderful dine-out night."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, loved sitting outside and watching the river.  Service could have been better-- our waitress was nice, but not very attentive."}
{"text":"(Boyfriend speaking) We were unimpressed overall with our experience. It was a fairly nice day out so were looking to walk a little bit and then check out Burntwood Tavern in Crocker park. I decided to get the pork tenderloin and my girlfriend got the Asiago crusted chicken. The pork tenderloin was so chewy I could barely swallow it. I always finish my meal no matter where we go but I just could just not finish the pork tenderloin. My girlfriend's Asiago crusted chicken was just okay. For the price we paid it was a little too tough (over cooked) for her or my liking. I made my server aware of it, her response was a laugh. And an older gentleman brought out our desert (maybe manager?) and we let him know too and he told us \"he would let the cook know\" but nothing was comped on our bill. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely AWFUL experience. We waited half an hour for our drink order to be taken, and an hour to have our dinner order taken. Once our order was taken we waited almost another hour until we received our food (all I ordered was a salad and white chicken chili!!). The chili arrived cold and when I told the waitress it was cold, she stated \"oh, it's cold?\" and took it and walked away, without offering to get me anything else. Staff was unfriendly in general and not accommodating whatsoever. If the food would have been good, or the service would have been decent, it would have been one thing, but we waited extremely too long for mediocre service and cold food. I am now going to a local grocery store so I can finally eat dinner at 9:00 in the evening. I will NEVER be going back."}
{"text":"Great food, music and bartenders .. when I can walk in and the bartender already has my drink started it says everything! Tyler is awesome - the one that's getting ready to serve and protect!"}
{"text":"Not from the area. My Dr office is up the street, so I asked my Dr, & his staff is there a restaurant they recommend? More than 2 people recommended Burntwood Tavern. They delivered! Me, & my cousin enjoyed! Friendly atmosphere. Nice ambiance. Great food! I will dine there again, after my appointment next month!"}
{"text":"Great food! Good wine selection, too. Outdoor atmosphere was awesome! Great for a laid back date night or a family get together."}
{"text":"This place was great. First time eating here. I would definitely return to try out some of the menu items.     Went for a girls day to the outlets and what do you do when your all done shopping? Eat drink and be merry.     We decided to give the appetizers a try since they were half off during happy hour. Everything we ordered was delicious ( except the item with blue cheese) blah so I ate the chips without it. The chicken sliders were my favorite next came the quesadilla. They have Happy hour every day from 3 to 6 which is unusual for restaurants on the weekends.      The service was spot on. I don't remember his name because I took to long to write this review. Our waiter was great so over all I say thumbs up. If I am out in this area again I will definitely stop back."}
{"text":"Sharp-looking place that's pretty decent. I feel like it's a place that everyone says they love so you feel like, oh, maybe I love it too. Calamari is tasty, ceaser is good, asiago chicken is likeable. Nothing to rave about but a solid chill place for lunch and dinner. Good staff!"}
{"text":"Just like the other locations, it's a nice cozy place to sit with people and eat. The daily special Nashville Chicken was really good. The stroganoff was very earthy - too earthy for my liking. Service was great."}
{"text":"Came for a special event with some people from work. Surprisingly, the place was packed at 12:30 on a weekday. We almost weren't seated! I'm not sure if the number of people can be blamed for it, but I found the service to be excruciatingly slow. Took forever for someone to come and bring us water and throughout the meal we would only get a server AFTER we were out of something. Definitely killed my mood to have to feel like I needed to be vigilant for a server.   I ordered their special of the day, which was a Cuban sandwich. Decent, especially on a pretzel bun, but not as flavorful as most Cubans I've had. It's like the flavors were pressed right out of it when they put it in a panini press. I substituted blistered asparagus for my fries and was extremely disappointed. 7 tiny stalks? Really?   The people I was with seemed to enjoy their meals. The tater tots were a hit, as was the seemingly endless bag of fries. Maybe I just needed to stick with more steak 'n' potatoes options. The only thing that saved the meal for me was the dessert--a very tasty apple crumble with caramel and caramel ice cream. Came out warm, so the ice cream melted everywhere!   If I hadn't been with others and hadn't had dessert, the star count would definitely be lower. But everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals and I did have a tasty dessert, so maybe it was just my meal...."}
{"text":"Great pretzel rolls Side salads were overdressed and full of raw onion Asiago chicken was dry, burnt, inedible. Potatoes were hard Hubby's salmon pasta was no big deal   Desserts were nothing special Will not returns Our server was excellent. but it couldn't override poor food preparation"}
{"text":"I've eaten many times here!  Usually delicious! Tonight.. not so much.  The red snapper special was undercooked and the vegetable side was greasy.  My daughter ordered the tuna sandwich.  It was so covered in the \"sauce\" she had to scrape it off.  Anyway, we would have retuned both, but our server was too busy with a big party! Something is going on here.  This is not their usual.  I am very disappointed.  With Rose just opening, this is bad news."}
{"text":"A decent choice if you have some time at Crocker Park. The ambiance is quite nice as they had live music in the bar when my friend and I arrived. We were seated promptly in the bar area with a large window open to the beautiful outdoors.   Service afterwards was a bit slow. Our server passed or table several times while we needed drink refills and had our finished plates at our table for probably around 15 minutes before they were cleared.  The food was decent, but nothing to write home about. However, they were priced quite well. I must say that I was surprised to pay $7 for a Bell's Oberon. For a domestic beer, it's not outrageous, but definitely on the higher end, especially for a restaurant in Cleveland.   Bottom line, decent place with good food if you just need a place to stop. Lots of restaurants in the area though."}
{"text":"To start on a positive note, the valet parking makes one feel invited.  We used to frequent this place, but the food quality has declined over the past 6 to 8 months to where we will not return. They used to have wonderful salads, but now it's chopped head lettuce on a plate topped bagged chicken squares. Many better options in the area like grove hill restaurant.  We tried it again last week since it was patio weather and they do have a good patio. Had what used to be my favorite.... Shrimp tacos...they changed by using popcorn size shrimp, not blackened as used to be, and the sauce is somehow different as well.. Not my fave anymore... The patio was empty except for us and 2 other couples. Would love to see them turn this place around, but with the food coming out of the kitchen... I'm afraid they are doomed.... Get a good chef (like the one at M's) update the menu, hire staff that smiles and pays attention to your guests, clean up the patio bar.  Well... we tried again today and sat at the outside bar. Attacked by yellow jackets at the bar ,,, told the bar tenders (one who had been stung) who didn't seem to care. Ordered a Makers Manhattan and got an old fashion. Close but no cigar. My wife, who loves Bloody Marys went for the Bloody Mary bar......not good and more of an inconvenience than fun. Note the fried pickles were good. Overall we were disappointed and decided to go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Our server, Taylor, was awesome. She was attentive, very polite, and always around if we needed her. She definitely is one of the best servers I've encountered anywhere!  The food was good. I had the tavern burger. It was cooked to perfection, tasted amazing, and was gone in probably 10 minutes. It was that good. Their fries are also amazing. I should have ordered a side to go! Yum!  The specialty drinks weren't my style. They were good, just I wasn't overly impressed. Would that stop me from returning? Heck no.   In short, I'll be back. And I'll be hungry!"}
{"text":"We went there with a big group on a Monday and sat outside. Although the food was a bit slow, the server was great and so was the food. Always a nice setting"}
{"text":"chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries- yum tuna nachos were delish atmosphere was very cool"}
{"text":"Great patio except the dumpster is right next to it and it smells. I see a large turnover in the servers as well as the managers. It is hit or miss when you go there with the experience. The place certanly has the potential to be one of the best, if they can get it consistent."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Burntwood Tavern. First the positives: I was blown away by the ambiance and the River views and the casual seating with fire pits on the patio.  I sat right next to the two-piece band who play great, light and fun music, which I was totally digging. What a great hang out spot. I'm attracted to the feel of this place for sure.  As a lounge or social venue, I give it high marks. However, the food left a LOT to be desires. I ordered the fresh-squeezed lemonade which tastes like lemon-flavored water. I replaced it with the berry tea, which was just sweet enough and refreshing. The quesadillas appetizer was up to par. The asiago crusted chicken entree was crusted but well cooked. The potatoes Quinan were ok. Sparce, but ok.  My friend ordered the tater tots which were recommended as \"amazing.\" Nope. Burnt, flavor-short hash brown balls. And the black bean burger is really composed of a compacted patty of refried beans and rice. Be ready to eat with a spoon.   Overall, as a restaurant, the food needs help. As a beautiful place to gather with friends and maybe drink and buy appetizers....DEFINITELY the place to be. Two stars for the food. I give the ambiance and layout 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious food, reasonable prices, and OUTSTANDING service. Saw a waitress make an accommodation for a special needs teen when he was unhappy with the presentation of his food. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, service a little slow.  We had a large group and the waitress kept having to come back to do 1 thing at a time, take drink orders then came back without drinks to take app orders, then the same with the food.  Otherwise, dealing with that was worth it because the food here is simply amazing.  We all tried different appetizers, the spinach and artichoke dip, calamari (a little too garlic-y), and the potato tots with cheese.  All very good.  I got the lunch combo of a 1/2 sandwich (club) and salad(house), very good and generous portions.  I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just about the worst service ever in Rocky River. I mean REALLY BAD. After 2 hours of suffering through this they offered us a comped dessert...which NEVER CAME! I get it - things happen, just own up to it and make it better - why not apologize at least? A new low."}
{"text":"I have such a good time every time I come here. We went here to celebrate my cousin's bachelorette party and I'm so glad we did. They gave us a semi-private table and when the meal was over they gave us all a glass of champagne. My other cousin, the maid of honor, was underage by a year or so and they totally didn't give her any trouble and understood that she was just celebrating. I'm not condoning anything, it was just pleasant that they didn't give her a hard time on her sister's night.   The food was fantastic and the staff was super friendly and even played along with some of our bachelorette games!"}
{"text":"Love the interior of Burntwood. However what the restaurant looks like doesn't mean a thing. Food is awful, reminds me of an Applebee's. Yuck! Cocktails are good, if you have the right bartender. I recommend going for pre dinner or post dinner drinks."}
{"text":"We live nearby, had dinner here upon a recommendation from a friend. Called the day before for a reservation for two, was told nothing was available. We went anyway, ended up eating at the bar. I'm fine with that. Ordered the wedge and Caesar salads, which were acceptable. Entrees included the steak and lamb rack. Both meats arrived timely and cooked as requested. Nothing on the menu I haven't seen anywhere before. Should mention that this restaurant is LOUD. I mean seriously LOUD, couldn't understand my waitress and she was standing right next to me. A walk through the dining room to the back patio revealed it wasn't just the bar area, the whole place is LOUD. For dessert, we tried the bread pudding which was terribly dry. Ambiance is lovely here, just be prepared to shout at your dining companion."}
{"text":"Great food with beautiful presentation. We came on Saturday night and place was packed, even so our waitress was attentive."}
{"text":"Sabrina is my favorite bartender.   Always knows my drinks and what I order.  Best bartender ever.  She is very attentive and always smiling. I am a consistant regular to Burntwood for her."}
{"text":"Had a chance to check out brunch at the latest restaurant iteration in this spot, and I was pretty pleased. Service was very good (thanks, Robby!), the new interior is quite nice, and the food was pretty solid. We all shared the Calamari starter, the Eggs Benedict with Prime Rib, the Breakfast Burrito and the Asiago Crusted Chicken. I liked the Breakfast Burrito the best and my sister and nephew both liked the Asiago Chicken, but the Eggs Benedict was a bit of a let-down for all of us. Also, I will say, the bar area looks beautiful after this rehab, and I'm looking forward to returning at some point for drinks and appetizers. Here's hoping this place manages to succeed, unlike some of its predecessors that have been at this spot post-Spanish Tavern!"}
{"text":"Whoa, Burntwood. You're blowing LeFevre's & Samira, this building's past inhabitants, out of the water. After a few failed restaurants in this spot, it's great to see someplace that's likely to stick - & if the hustle & bustle at Burntwood is any indication, this one is likely here for the long haul.   I confess that I think the service, ambiance, & novelty (great view of the river!) are sometimes better than the food, which tends to be on the heavy/greasy side, but I don't have any real complaints to air about Burntwood. Prices are generally reasonable, with great, low-priced happy hour specials, & the menu is varied enough that just about anyone can find something to eat here.   I'm a fan of the Smoked Prime Rib Chili, the Tavern Chips (kettle chips topped with gorgonzola, bacon, garlic, & scallions), & the Angry Chicken Pizza (gorgonzola, pickled onion, scallions, parmesan peppercorn ranch & \"angry sauce\"). The  Zucchini Frites have promise & are occasionally delicious, but more often than not, they've arrived to my table absolutely soaking wet with grease & bordering on inedible; I steer clear of them these days.  This place gets incredibly crowded come happy hour & at dinnertime on the weekends, though there rarely seems to be a wait. It can get loud, so plan accordingly or ask not to be seated in the bar area. It's also good for groups, & they've got a party room for rent, making it ideal for business lunches or events. I've always found the service to be friendly & fast, & the servers tend to remember frequent diners & regularly express their appreciation.  Most of all, in good weather, you can't beat Burntwood's outdoor seating, with gorgeous views of the Cuyahoga River - and, in the fall, the foliage that lines it."}
{"text":"My parents are here from overseas & since j Alexanders had a 40 minute wait on a Saturday night, we decided we'd check out this place.   We were seated immediately so things started off promising. However after 15 minutes of sitting there without being asked for water, appetizers/drinks or even acknowledged, we just decided to leave.   It wasn't busy. Just a birthday group to which the lone waiter was dedicating all his attentions to.   Not sure why the service was so bad. As mentioned they weren't busy. They just lost out on 7 peoples business. We walked over to J Alexander's and spent $400 Id rather wait & pay more but get good service."}
{"text":"Gave this place another chance after the first time which was arguably the worst meal we have had in a long time.  This time, service was extremely slow, drinks were bad and wrong, messed up order, and when food finally arrived 2 of the 4 were sent back.  The location is great, but not worth the horrible service and so-so food."}
{"text":"Ugggg I hate to do this as I have many friends who enjoy this place, but my experience was not good. First off - I don't complain during dinner and this time was no different. However, I could tell the minute my waiter came to the table - it was not good. I could barely understand what he was saying and he was very unwelcoming when he approached the table. I ordered two glasses of Chardonnay thru the dinner, and each took a minimum of 15 minutes to receive. Same with others at the table.  My food left a lot to be desired. We ordered the tuna nachos which were good... But the white sauce was like a sour cream. Very little taste which ruined the whole appetizer in my opinion. We've ordered these at the Chagrin location and were much better. I then ordered the asiago chicken. Our waiter told me it was one fried piece of chicken and he was right - it was so dry and tasteless. By the time I asked the waiter for salt and pepper - I was halfway done.   Service was horrible - waiter was hustling, but maybe had too many tables. Had to ask twice for bread which came out 2 minutes before dinner.  Never came back to check how the meal was and our drinks took an average of 15 to 20 minutes.  I won't return to this location. Period."}
{"text":"Better than some of it's predecessors (Seared and Zeke's anyone?) but a little pricey for what basically amounts to bar food.   Went recently on a Friday (2 couples). Place was crowded with a line around 7. We made reservations and were seated upstairs.  I have to say that for some of the people on Yelp as well as others who told us that the inside was 'transformed', I beg to differ. It's the same chopped up, multi-level, no-flow place it was before with nicer floors and lighting.  Bonus is the musty smell is gone. But it's just a weird place that probably needs to be knocked down with a real building put up in its place. Nothing special.  And how this place gets away with all the stairs in this day and age of accessibility for disabled is beyond me.   As far as the food, I had the Asiago Chicken which was pretty good (a little on the warm side vs. hot but okay), my wife had a cuban (only ate half of it as it was not very flavorful, friends had some sort of club sandwich (again nothing worthy of writing about) and a burger (hard to screw up a burger). Also had the homemade chips (very good) and the homemade hummus which was a weirdly thin consistency. As if hummus doesn't  look enough like baby poop, the thin consistency took that visual to the next level.  Service was good, efficient and friendly.   Bill for 2 people (1 sandwich, 1 chicken, 1 appetizer, 3 drinks) was over $60 (without tip). That said, it's overpriced for the food we had.  Side note: I think some of the management might be a little too full of themselves with this place as we were walking out and I looked down the stairs to the bar where a woman standing at a microphone with cheesy colored lights behind her and looked like she was getting ready to sing. I mentioned to my friend 'oh, they have karaoke here too'. This snooty short guy who worked there and overheard me was clearly miffed with this notion and said rather bluntly 'it's not karaoke, we have live music here'.  Well Ahoy Polloi (for you Caddyshack afficianados). Pardon me!   In any case we'll probably give it another try but it was nothing special the first time around, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. The tavern tots were delicious and one of a kind. Burger was made perfect and the environment was relaxing. River was beautiful."}
{"text":"Overall: 4 stars.  The food and interior are excellent.  Service is very good, and prices are on the high side.  Service: 4 stars.  The server was attentive and knowledgeable, but a bit hard to find sometimes.  Free valet is nice, although the parking lot was a mess to drive through.  They had a singer with a guitar, who was good but very loud and made it hard to have a conversation.  Food: 5 stars.  The appetizer tuna nachos were excellent.  For the entree, I got the chicken madeira, which was very good too, I also like how they have their own beers.  For the Manhattan drink, they put in way too much ice; it shouldn't be served that cold.  Prices: 3 stars.  The prices were on the high side, but expected for a nicer restaurant.  Interior Appearance: 5 stars.  I like the classic feel of a lodge.  The wood burning fireplace in a restaurant is something I haven't seen in a long time."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. We ordered chili and split the fish and chips, which they were kind enough to serve on 2 plates. Big problem was drink service and prices. I ordered a strong IPA, which was served in a 12 oz. tulip glass. That's not a big deal, but for $7 I don't expect 2\" of head space. I saw the bartender pour numerous drafts this way- fast and carelessly. My wife ordered a Margarita, which turned into \"premium\" by default and cost $9. Ended up spending over $60 for 3 drinks, 2 small cups of chili, and a split entree. Way too pricey for what is, in my opinion, a casual bar."}
{"text":"Positives:     1.  The atmosphere is absolutely wonderful.  After going outside and viewing the building and the river I found myself researching more info about the history of the site.  2.  Appetizers.  We got the tavern chips and they were awesome.  I would come back just for this dish and the drinks 3.   Drinks. The bar drinks were generous on the alcohol pours and tasted good.   Negatives:   1.  Dinner meals:  I guess to be fair we were a hit and a miss for our table. My husband liked his filet medallions and the potatoes that came with his meal were very flavorful. My steak and frites meal was just bland as well as the side asparagus that we ordered.  The steak, fries, and asparagus were all VERY under seasoned.  Almost no flavor at all.   My fries were cold as well as my steak. For example the steak came with a pat of \"flavored\" butter on top.  The meat was cold enough on the outside that the butter never melted.  It was cooked to the proper medium rare so it should have been hot on the outside.   2.   Service:  the hostess staff was very friendly and up near.  Our waitress started off with effort but once we got our meal my husband had finished his entire meal before anyone came back to check on us. Meanwhile I was desperately craving a salt and pepper shaker that were lacking on every table. I needed those shakers to add some sort of flavor to my food.  3.   And probably the biggest negative.  When we arrived I used the women's restroom.  There was no soap dispenser handing anywhere in the bathroom.  I'm not sure if there has been one and it recently came off the wall or something but I didn't see anything that looked like there may have been one.  There was a large bottle of soap that was the type intended to go into a dispenser just sitting on the counter.  Because it is meant to hang upside down rather than being sat upright like it was the soap does not dispense out but maybe 2 tiny drops of foam soap.  So there is literally no way that anyone using the women's restroom is properly washing their hands after.  There are a lot of females workers who cannot possibly be washing hand to proper health codes."}
{"text":"I have been to lunch a few times this month at this location and the one in C-Falls so I am a fan of the food and bar.   My only holdback are the prices. If you are on a budget then this might not be the spot for you. A $13 flat bread is pretty steep. It will keep the working stiffs away but that might be the idea.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I am a big fan of Burntwood and have been for years. I frequented their Solon and Chagrin Falls location when I lived on that side of town and had a 5 star experience every time. So, when I was told there was a location in Lyndhurst closer to my home, I immediately made plans to have a Saturday lunch with a friend.  We were greeted with a smile and seated. We sat and waited. And waited. And waited, until finally someone approached our table asking if we had been helped yet. The waitress was kind and apologized profusely and took our drink orders. Fast forward another few minutes, a different young lady who I think was our server came to our table. I can't even tell you her name because she never told us. She seemed very disheveled and out of it, made no suggestions, didn't ask if we had any questions, nothing.   My friend ordered a burger and he said it was fantastic. I ordered the field greens salad and a margherita flatbread. While waiting for our food, the girl who I think was our server never checked in, never asked if we needed more drinks, nothing! Then a third server dropped off our food so fast and took off without asking if we needed anything. The salad was good but the flatbread was awful. I took a few bites and when our server finally came to check on us (I was halfway done with the salad of this gives you an indication of time lapse) I asked for the Tater tots instead. She didn't apologize or ask why I didn't like the flatbread. She didn't even offer what else I would like, I was waiting for common sense customer service and it never came.  Tots were terribly salty. I ate a few anyway because I didn't want to be \"that guest\".   I am appalled at the lack of attention and service we received today. We sat there for a very long time, I'm talking 10+ minutes with empty dishes and glasses in front of us before they were cleared. As someone who not only loves BWT and was also in the business for a decade, it was completely unacceptable. The restaurant was not busy and they seemed to be adequately staffed; however we barely saw who I thought was our server. Atrocious experience today and we won't return to this location. Major letdown considering how excited I was."}
{"text":"This place is nice but the food is so-so. We came here on a Sunday for brunch and sat on the patio. It wasn't very crowded but for some reason our food took forever to come out. Our waitress didn't check on us much either.  The tater tots were really good and were basically like mashed potato balls. That was a plus. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and was disappointed that it was just served on regular toast. A bun would have been better. The cost is average. Decent spot, probably won't come back though."}
{"text":"We went for Brunch and I thought the food was excellent. There is a Bloody Mary Bar that you can fix and load up your own Bloody Mary. I had the Nashville chicken sandwich and it was very good. Waitress was great and catered to our every need. Would definitely like to go back and try the dinner entrees."}
{"text":"We went here with 4 adults and my 7 month old daughter. I was scoping out the place for a possible party. It used to be The Pub; which had the BEST fish and chips this side of England. The manager was too busy so the waitress took my info and said she would call me. She never did. Anyway, the food was good. I liked it. But it was pricey. And it wasn't great enough for it to be that pricey. The fish and chips were good. They weren't $17 good, though. And the only real complaint is the amount of tables near the restroom area. They have so many tables crammed back there, all night people kept squeezing by to get to the restrooms.  We probably won't be going back anytime soon. There are so many great restaurants in Lakewood. We don't need a sub-par one in RIver. But the place is gorgeous. Go and have a drink at the bar for sure :)"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food at this restaurant and I have been multiple times.  It has a great location, next to the falls, but the service was lacking and the food did not live up to the price tag.  If you want a nice bar atmosphere this is a great place but I would not recommend it for the food."}
{"text":"You can't beat a restaurant with an amazing view. This location is one of my favorites. There is plenty of seating options outside and inside.The meals are reasonably priced and the ambiance is cool. We have never been disappointed by the food either. The salmon salad is so, so delicious. Everything must try the Tavern Chips, too! Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been to Burntwood Tavern in Rocky River several times, but this was my first visit to this location in Crocker Park. Our lunch was even better than I expected and I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area.  The menu offers some nice options on the lunch menu. The Combo options included some great salads and sandwiches. I went with the House Salad and California Chicken Sandwich. The House Salad was far from a basic house salad. I loved all of the toppings and the dressing was delicious. The sandwich was also very good. Our table also shared a side of Tavern Tots. They were huge and tasted like a loaded mashed potato in tater tot form. A tasty side for sure.  Service was good on the day of our visit and food came out quickly. The prices were great. I couldn't believe how cheap it was to have lunch here."}
{"text":"This place has an ingenious business philosophy.  If we open an establishment that  a)  Looks good b)  Serves alcohol c)  Has food that doesn't make people sick d)  Doesn't have competition   then people will keep coming back.  Throw something else in there about serving $9.00 margaritas that taste like cough syrup, too.  Bad service and $15 salads made with iceberg lettuce.  You haven't fooled me, Burntwood Tavern.  See you again when it's 90 degrees in January."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and accommodating. Food was excellent.  Pretzel rolls were warm and delicious. Our family had an enjoyable evening here, would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food is good and menu has interesting choices, but service is spotty.  My server had been poorly trained and my lunch took over 1 and 1/2 hours."}
{"text":"We visited again today.  Our food was delicious, the noise level had improved and our server, Zack, was outstanding.  It is the type of place we can go to regularly. The prices are fair and the menu varied.  We were told that a new menu had been created and will be available next month. I hope it will be as good as the present one."}
{"text":"Burntwood Tavern is a go-to place for us. Set in a renovated old movie theater, it's industrial meets cozy and their patio is great to sit on during the warmer months (although there is a fireplace out there for added warmth during chillier months). Live music on most weekend nights. Service has always been good, if not a little overbearing, which isn't always a bad thing. They have a good beer/cocktail selection with a full bar. Food has always been delicious, I just wish their menu had a few more entree selections that are budget friendly. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"We had a group of friends meetup there for Xmas this past weekend.  We ordered 4 of the Tuna Nacho appetizers or whatever they are called.  6 of us ate them, 6 of us got violently ill for the next 48 hours.  I have eaten at all the burntwoods and haven't ever had an issue, so it was probably just some spoiled tuna or rotten guacamole."}
{"text":"I'm from Dallas where we have a ton of good restaurants. This place was spot on. The food was great, the drinks were awesome...the best martini I've ever had. Our server was super friendly and accommodating. Shout out to David for being an awesome server! We even got a visit from the manager m, which made us feel extra special. Thanks for the superb service and the awesome food. The atmosphere was great as well."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Not like Chagrin Falls or Solon locations.  Can see why it was not busy. A turkey Ruben should have sauerkraut not cole slaw on it-or the menu should say it has cole slaw slaw. And the waiter did not seem to care. Just told me I was the 35th person to complain about it."}
{"text":"I really want to like the food here because I work in the area, but I just can't. Do the owners read these reviews? They should because it can be fixed, they just need better cooks (I'd like to use the word chef, but they are clearly just cooks) Change up the menu, get better bar tenders, and pay attention to food coming out of the kitchen. I sat at the bar for 7 minutes and watched the bar tender walk past me three times until i said can i get a beer? For example, I ordered a bowl of soup that came half empty. there is no salt and pepper on the table, and then your food is cold by the time they bring it. I was there on a Monday night, and service was so bad, the waiter actually said, well were slow on Mondays. Does that mean don't go there Monday because expect it to suck?"}
{"text":"Great place for Brunch!!! Very friendly staff and great food and atmosphere . Chris, our bartender, was very knowledgeable and friendly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I keep giving the Burntwood \"another chance\" and it really doesn't change.  The first server that stopped by out table after we sat for 12 minutes took our drink order and was making faces the entire time ....like we were wasting her time or something.  The second server was better but seemed disappointed that we only ordered appetizers....one of these times I hope to write a good review.  I really want to like it there."}
{"text":"I was always impressed by this location over the others.  So whenever I'm in Cuyahoga Falls around lunch time I stop in.  This time I had the Nashville chicken sandwich.  Wow... that's a good sandwich!  I hope they keep it on the menu for a while."}
{"text":"3/23/18 Best happy hour around. Had deviled eggs (not bad), calamari (good, but not crispy and has tomato sauce...prefer glaze), smoked chicken quesadilla (thick and cylindrical, not flat. Liked the taste), gator tots (stellar...not at all like frozen bag), chicken sliders (crispy and very tasty), Pear of cucs (awesome drink), Moscow mule (had much better), pour mule (unique, interesting, but I wouldn't get it again). Love the vibe...great atmosphere. Service incredibly slow.   - Rob's rating on Zomato: 3.5."}
{"text":"First let me say, that our server Colin was terrific.  Now for the bad news.  My husband ordered the fish special Rainbow Trout with a beurre blanc lemon butter sauce.  The fish arrived and there was no sauce, it was simply beurre blah!  The fish was completely overcooked, no sauce and the side of potatoes was so meager and overdone, you couldn't even really make out what the side was.  I ordered a burger medium rare, lettuce, pickle no tomatoes, no onions with a side of sweet potato fries.  What I got was a burger, medium well, tomato, onion, and regular fries that obviously had been in the fryer too long.  Credit to Colin, I brought it to his attention and he immediately fixed it and took it off the bill, the right thing to do.  It seems the front of the house has it all going on, but the kitchen needs some serious oversight.  It was Friday night, when the \"A\" team should have been in the kitchen, obviously they weren't.  The food is just not that special to return for mediocre.  Had a great experience at the Burntwood Tavern in Brecksville last fall and that is what led me here.  No comparison."}
{"text":"Worth going to! The food is excellent and there are never any complaints on service. Keep in mind, the place is far from cheap, but most of the time, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Had the best lunch here!  Always order lunch combo california chicken sandwich and field greens salad - today was best yet!  Was concerned- came here in November had the same thing - terrible - very small salad- size of English muffin and mostly tomatoes - half sandwich - dry bread and very little dry chicken! Needless to say concerned to try again especially recommending to family members who said they tried previously and did not like it!  But today was a hit all the way around! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Dined here on a sat nite with a group of 4. Had reservations but arrived 1/2 hour early and seated right away. We had several apps, 2 had the fish sandwich and 1 the fish & chips meal. I've never seen a bigger piece of fish as the meal. Giant!  We were all satisfied with the food. You have to try the homemade tater tots!!  We were seated upstairs kinda secluded and I was worried we were going to be forgotten. Not the case, our server was always around. I liked the very medieval feel of this location. Surprisingly, the place never filled up despite being prime dinner time on a Saturday. The forced valet parking is a little odd. Lot was completely full but restaurant wasn't? Not a huge deal to pay a few bucks to the valets, just unnecessary to be forced to."}
{"text":"Good food and a great gluten free menu! Our server was fantastic and even allowed me to sample the gazpacho (which I highly recommend). She was also very attentive to my restrictions. Live music was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Love it. The decor is great. The food was wonderful, just the right size portions. The staff are nice. Will be coming back. We came in winter and the river looked cool partly frozen."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? When I cannot think of a thing to suggest to improve, that is what I rate a place.  In this case, lunch on a weekday, everything was good.  The server was attentive and easy about altering my companion's salmon. He enjoyed it.  Even though I ordered a simple Wedge Salad, it was impressively delicious and I ate every bite.  I have eaten here before and was favorably impressed. Good food and good serve. What more can I ask?"}
{"text":"Just had the stuffed trout special.  It was excellent!  Stuffed with crab meat with a wonderful caper butter wine sauce."}
{"text":"Worst burger ever. I can pay same money and get a delicious burger at a small diner. Asked for no-pink in middle burger and got a pink in the middle all most raw burger. Disappointed is it word. Go throw away your money in this place."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, food and fire. Great selection of appetizers for a happy hour experience. Try the wonton fish tacos."}
{"text":"This was our first trip since this restaurant reopened as Burntwood Tavern. Saturday reservation at 7pm, the place was packed. We went over to the bar to wait, but that too was packed - no seats, no tables. So we stood around for about 10 minutes waiting to be seated (but not too bad, given the crowd.)  Once we were seated, a server promptly came to our table and took drink orders. Our table had 2 appetizers, the tavern chips and the artichoke, roasted garlic & Tasso Fondue. Both were excellent - surprisingly big portions for appetizers and quite tasty. Definite winners; we'd order either one again in a heartbeat.  A few of us had salads - nothing spectacular but everything was fresh. Overpriced for what you get, so I'd probably pass next time. They should just include the house salad with entrees -- not worth an extra charge IMO.  For entrees, we had the Asiago Crusted Chicken (very good, and a decent sized portion,) prime rib (can't remember if this was a standard menu item or special, but it was very good, and the smoked flavor was very interesting,) and the salmon spinach fettucini (disappointingly small portion for the $16 price tag, but still very good -- a very heavy cream sauce with something in it that I couldn't quite put my finger on -- wasn't the garlic, which was tastefully done and didn't overpower things -- but whatever it was, it made it very good. This was my favorite of everything sampled.)  Some of us had a dessert. Nothing spectacular there -- very small, served in a tiny glass mug - don't save any room for these, you can eat one on a full stomach if you just want to finish off with something sweet. It was a nice ending, and the bread pudding (white chocolate cherry with anglaise & raspberry coulis) was my favorite.  With a glass of wine (reasonably priced, as were mixed drinks), appetizer, salad, entree and dessert, we were around $50-$55 each including tip. The food was good (in some cases very good) but it just seemed a little pricey for what you got. We like to dine at places like Chez Francois (our favorite,) Johnny's, Giovanni's, etc., and to be honest, I'd rather pay the extra money and eat there (those are better values IMO.) Having said that, if we're in the area and looking for something good, wouldn't hesitate to stop back at Burntwood Tavern. There's a reason this restaurant is routinely packed...  Oh yes, parking was a mess. The small lot they have was full, with almost no place to self-park. I'd strongly recommend using their complimentary valet service if you're going there for a Friday or Saturday dinner. We did, and the car was promptly delivered after our meal. You'll definitely need reservations (and may have to make them more than a week in advance) for popular days/times."}
{"text":"Went to Burntwood Tavern last night (8 days after their soft opening) and will defiitely return.  Hoping to increase my stars after another visit.  The exterior and interior space are simply gorgeous.  Rustic, elegant, and welcoming.  Bravo!!!  The bar area is cozy and will definitely return to enjoy it.  They offer complimentary valet parking.  Nice detail.    We were greeted by two hostesss who were fun and nice.  They wisked us away to our table immediately and even provided crayons and paper to color on for our toddler.  Booster seat was provided immediately.  So far so good. And then....  We sat at our table and no one came to greet us or take drink orders for over 15 mins.  The restaurant was only half filled, but the servers looked very busy and were stretched thin a bit.  Not sure if it was due to lack of experience of lack or staff.    Service: we experienced ALOT of service issues while dining here.  From our main dishes arriving before our apps, had to ask for the complimentary bread (30 mins into us being seated and still having no food), having a 6:15 reservation but not seeing a morsel of food until 7pm (and with a toddler you know that is a challenge!), no water being provided, no beverage order was taken for my child, my silverware was really dirty, and my husbands dessert dripping from its containers down the table, down to his napkin and on his shoes (the method in which they present the dessert is in a small beer mug. he had the apple pie with vanilla ice cream on top.  when they brought it out, the ice cream was already completely melted).  Despite the things mentioned above, our server was so kind and really tried the best she could. I could sense she was new to serving but one thing she earned 5 stars for was her attitude.     The food was really good and I look forward to trying more from the menu.  Ordered the Tuna Nacho app (beautiful presentation and was delish) and the calamari app (was fresh and simple).  We ordered the pot roast pasta and salmon spinach pasta and both were tasty and flavorful.  The kids menu was excellent because it was not only affordable but offered salmon with snap peas which is a great departure from chicken strips and fries (they offered that too..no worries).  Food was fresh and came out nice and hot (except tuna of course!)  Dessert was a flop.  4 choices all presented in these little beer mugs. We ordered the apple pie with vanilla ice cream, red velvet cake with cream on top, and carrot cake with cream on top.  All dessert items came out really cold (including apple pie so not sure how the ice cream melted all over the place before its arrival to our table) which hinders the true taste of the dessert. At least closer to room temp would have been better.  I would skip dessert next time.  It was fun watching other tables orders arrive because they were presented so beautifully.  In case management reads this review....please reconsider the mat you place on top of the tablecloth.  It kept snagging both of our clothes.  The mat is a very modern and contemporary mat that you would see at C&B as a place mat.  Love the look...but it appears they were cut to size for the table but the border where it was cut was the part that caused the snags.  It is sweater season, so beware!  We are excited that Burntwood came to Brecksville and will DEFINITELY return.  We are hopeful and confident that service items will be tweaked as you get settled in."}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland over Christmas, my brother and I went to Bruntwood Tavern for brunch last Sunday.  They have an awesome Bloody Mary bar with tons of garnishes and your choice of infused vodka.  I ordered mine with pickle juice. It was really tasty.  I ordered broken yolk egg sandwich without bacon and hashbrowns on the side. The sandwich was a decent size and was super filling.  I really liked the addition of mayo to a breakfast sandwich.  Yum!  Their potatoes are outstanding--they're the same ones they come with dinner entrees.  I could eat a whole plate of them!  The server was very attentive and friendly throughout the course of our meal.  I would definitely recommend going to brunch at Burntwood Tavern."}
{"text":"I'm pretty impressed with this restaurant. I went a few years ago (before I yelped) for dinner, and recall it being pricey but very tasty! Most memorable was the salmon being cooked on a cedar wood plank. The actual size of salmon was small, but the presentation was great. Wonder if they still do that...  My most recent visit only included late night drinks, however. I only had two but wow, those really packed a punch. Maybe it was the lighting, or because I skipped dinner, but those drinks really went to my head fast and made everything so beautiful. Good thing I only live a mile from this place!"}
{"text":"I have actually been to this location already a handful of times. Burntwood is one of those restaurants they are definitely decent and reliable. Are they a place that makes me wishful to return what I'm not there? No. But if I need a generally pleasing place to go for happy hour, or brunch, this would be my choice. Actually, I say ONLY GO FOR HAPPY HOUR. I don't find it worth it otherwise. In fact, our appetizers were actually salty. That probably helps with getting people thinking it is soOoOo goOoOoOod, when in fact they are just getting a load of sodium  I also appreciate that they switch up their menu very discreetly. So make sure you are checking out their offerings online to keep updated. My server was very friendly.   Hmmmm...I started off writing this as a three star review, but it was coming out all positive so I don't know what my deal was. But I will say I am going to definitely keep it four because their floor is oddly slippery. Like, I'm not sure how they haven't been sued for patrons falling. So yeah, I hate the floor."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, small menu mostly bar food! Not good for vegetarians! Wait staff looked confused. Just go to Hudson for a better selection of restaurants. Either be a bar or a high end restaurant!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at this restaurant on Friday evening, April 20.  It was the first time there for two of us. There was a party of four and three had the salmon and the other the steak. All entrees came as ordered, food was hot and very good. Our waiter, Thomas, was terrific, his service excellence started with wine and continued thru the appetizers.  He was very attentive, my wife's coffee cup was refilled several times and the coffee hit the spot. Thomas made our dinner an enjoyable experience. We will be back and request him as our waiter. A very satisfied customer, Ed and June"}
{"text":"Burntwood in Brecksville. Awesome!  I recently had a VR virtual realty event in the main dining area for about 70+ real estate agents. Food was awesome. Happy hour menus is really good. Drink prices are not to bad as well!!!  Thank you everyone at Burntwood on making my event a success. I recommend if you are looking for a venue to have a party or event stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"We've had mostly good experiences here. The vibe is awesome, and the bar and patio area are breathtaking. A perfect view of the river.   One visit, the service was particularly bad. We ordered appetizers and they came out after our food was brought out. That's pretty bad. She did take one off the bill, but we had to ask. We didn't even really want it after that. The waitress at the table next to us probably checked on her table 5 times to our 1. My water glass stayed empty for long periods of time. We finally had to waive the waitress for the table next to us down to find ours.  But our last visit, the service was excellent. We had a large group, and nobody sat by the people they were together on the checks with. And the servers were absolute champs. No waiting for refills and they got all of the orders correct.   The Nashville Hot chicken left a little to be desired, however, the fish sandwich was amazing. Large amounts of quantity, and quality. It was the biggest piece of fish I've ever seen, and was super tasty. The jalapeño tartar sauce is deeeeliciois."}
{"text":"I had dinner here recently on a work trip in the area.  My local co-workers had picked this place for a group dinner and the restaurant was very accommodating to our group of 10.  They have happy hour that goes until 6pm nightly that offers beer and liquor specials.  Our waitress was accompanied by a trainee and both were friendly and attentive to our needy group.    For my entrée I had the Steak Frites without the Frites as I'm currently on a Keto diet.  The steak was cooked to my liking and had a bit of chimichurri on it to give it some extra flavor.  Overall, the menu had a wide variety of food options to please everyone's picky tastes.  This is a place I'd go back to when in the area to try out more of the menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because my girlfriends who took me loved the food. The salads were good. The service and 1/2 sandwiches were terrible. The sandwiches did not have the sauces on them, and our server tyler said \"oh man they must have jipped you.\" Instead of apologizing or offering to bring the sauces? So sad, a classy place with unprofessional staff."}
{"text":"Dirty forks, flat Coke, syrupy margarita...what else can I say.  They used the same exact shell to make my margarita pizza as my husbands chicken quesadilla.  And if using a quesadilla shell to make a pizza is not insulting enough, they did not even use Roma tomatoes for the pizza, nothing hits the spot like a tasteless tomato on a quesadilla shell.    The real shame is that the decor is great but the menu and food is terrible. They are trying to be upscale, but the food is at Applebee's quality.  Completely disappointing."}
{"text":"Due to its plethora of imported draft options, I was disappointed to see the Pub go, but Burntwood seems to be a step up for two reasons. First, it matches all those taps the Pub boasted, but emphasizes delicious and widely varied domestic micros. If you're not a boozehound like me, the second reason is more compelling: The food appears to be considerably better than the Pub's. I don't mean that as damning with faint praise; the Pub had some lousy dishes, but it did many things competently. Nonetheless, I'm happy that Burntwood seems to have more ambition and a more coherent menu. My husband and I were impressed by the food: artichoke and Tasso fondue, fish (cod) and chips, and perfectly blackened scallops swimming in a refreshing gazpacho. It was imaginative and a cut above your standard pub fare. The fondue was accompanied by a delightful pickled red onion that did a nice job of cutting the delicious fattiness of the dip. My fish and chips arrived with a jalapeño tartar sauce and a slaw that featured Napa cabbage and red onion.     Servers were on their toes from the second we stepped in - efficient and friendly. They seem determined to avoid any early missteps. It's easy to see why, since the owners have clearly sunk a lot of time, money and effort into the space. Speaking of which, the space is well done, but could be a bit cold on a less-than-crowded night. Gone is virtually every trace of the faux British pub. In its place is a warm mixture of modern and rustic with a heavy emphasis on natural wood and simple accents. Think of it as a space that Danish architects designed in Kentucky to age bourbon."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere! Our waitress Michelle was excellent, very attentive. I got the asiago crusted chicken and my husband got the prime rib papperdelle pasta and both were not only good portions but we excellent tasting! Decently priced. Will come again!!"}
{"text":"It's like driving a Ferrari with a Honda Civic engine. This place gets 5 stars for the look and design, but a half star for the food. I wanted to love this place so bad because it looks so good but they definitely need to hire a new chef. I've been here at least 6 times trying different things but every time I leave disappointed. Their food is very bland, dry, and tasteless. I can't figure out who's tasting this crap before it winds up on the menu. Don't they read the reviews??? It's a cool place to have drink after work but that's it."}
{"text":"So I'm a Clevelander who though now living in DC often journeys home to visit the Solon (and Shaker Hts.) area as this is where my family lives.  I was thrilled to see some new dining options during my last visit.   Burntwood caught my eye mostly on account of its cool (and crowded) patio so my hubs and I dropped in for an early dinner.  Loved. Loved. Loved the 'rustic chic' decor and design of the space and felt like I was back home in DC somewhere!  We decided to eat at the bar which has an ok selection of local beers and craft spirits. Our bartender/server was personable and helpful--letting us know immediately that Burntwood has a happy hour every day of the week with some really good deals.  On to the food...!!!  Started with calamari and was really impressed with the flavoring and prep of it! It had a nice kick, wasn't overcooked and was tossed with peppers. Only miss here is I would have loved an aioli to accompany as opposed to standard marinara.  Followed with a wedge salad which was delicious and very well done.  For my main I did: smoke prime rib.  Say it with me: S-M-O-K-E-D P-R-I-M-E R-I-B.  The meat was incredible. Served with asparagus and some type of roasted potatoes with bacon I was more than pleased... and the portion was huge.  My husband had the steak frites (I think) that were served with 'tater tots.' Well let me say--those things were huge and rich and reminded me a lot of 'mini' cheddar bay biscuits. That's the best way I can describe their 'tater tots.' Very different and tasty!  Will definitely return when back in the CLE and hoping standards are the same!"}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp while in town for business. I had the Burntwood burger, but I subbed the beef for a blackbean burger. The burger was huge and nicely plated. It came with a generous side of natural cut French fries. My fellow employee had the same but with the beef burger. His was cooked to his liking as asked. Neither of us left hungry, the amount of food was worthy of the reasonable prices.  Only complaints:   The place was a bit cold, even with a sweater on. Most likely because of the lit fireplace messing with the thermostat. It is also 6*F outside, so I would assume this isn't normal.   Food could have been a touch warmer, but neither of us complained."}
{"text":"This place is a must go! Whether you are visiting or live near this place .. Everything was amazing! I had the lobster bisque and my bf got the tuna nachos! My brother had gotten the burnt wood burger which he said was cooked to perfection! I will keep this place in mind every time I go to visit him!"}
{"text":"I was salty at first for Burntwood taking the spot of The Pub, since I used to play trivia there on a weekly basis. Living within a mile of the restaurant and hearing people sing its praise made it hard to resist.  Quesadillas happen to be one of my favorite things- melty, cheesy, spiciness, rolled up in a crisp tortilla? Hells yea. I'll never forget my first time at dining here, when the waiter brought me the Burntwood quesadilla for the first time.... 4 egg roll shaped towers standing straight up on my plate like a city skyline. One bite of their playful quesadilla roll-ups made my tummy smile.  Since then, I've gone back for many a meal, including my company Christmas dinner and (possibly hung over) Sunday brunches. I would pass on their flatbreads. They are simple underwhelming. Their sandwiches, sweet potato fries, and brunch options are the bees knees. I don't typically like tomato juice or Bloody Mary's, but my boyfriend and I love creating our own spicy elixirs at their Bloody Mary bar! They have a few house-infused vodkas to choose from. They also have a variety of mimosas (grapefruit being my fave)."}
{"text":"We went this weekend. Serving was great, food was meh. I like the chicken quesadilla but the chicken sandwich on the pretzel bun wasn't all that great. I will come back and try some other things before I completely write it off my list."}
{"text":"The food is good but you have to be served to enjoy the food.  We sat 10 minutes and no server, we had to ask the host for our server.  The host was nice compted our drinks but still there is no excuse for this, (after sitting 10 minutes a white group comes in next to us and instantly gets service while my family sits 10 minutes) i do not know if i will return."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is great! Excellent, professional and friendly service. (Marissa) Blackened grouper special for me and mahi mahi tacos for my wife. Very tasty. Potatoes Quinlan on the side are really good. Large and varied draft beer selection and some interesting cocktails. Not the least expensive restaurant around but worth the price. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really love the happy hour here.  Top notch group of barkeepers led by Ryan, who came from the original location in Chagrin Falls.  Becca is great too.  You can get Moscow Mules served in copper mugs as they should be...  But what seals the deal is the menu of starters for half price.  Order a few and you have a complete meal!  And still get to the early movie or whatever."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Burntwood after receiving rave reviews from some friends in the area. We went for their happy hour for some appetizers and drinks. I loved decor on the inside. It's very cozy and feels like you're almost in a cabin or lodge.  I ordered the Campfire martini: marshmallow infused sobieski, simple syrup, half & half with chocolate & graham cracker rim. It tastes EXACTLY like a smore! I would highly recommend this cocktail.  I was not overly impressed with the appetizers. We tried the tavern chips, zucchini frites, and the smoked chicken quesadilla. Of the three, I would recommend the zucchini frites. They are super thin and look almost like onion straws. They were lightly breaded so it didn't taste like you were eating something that was deep fried and oozing with oil.   I would go back due to the great happy hour prices however I don't think I would go back and pay full price."}
{"text":"i'll keep it short and to the point...........good for happy hour i'm told, but i wouldn't return for dinner or happy hour!! food is average at best, appetizer sliders tasted like they were pan fried, unimpressive and would make a white castle slider look like a big mac!! had to get out my magnifying glass to see them!!! fish & chips was average with a tasteless cole slaw and 2 little planks of fish that looked like they came fresh out of the freezer, pre battered.  the service is rough and VERY VERY SLOW and untrained!!! server NEVER offered us the specials for the night because she thought they were too unimpressive. i don't think she really knew what they were......after we asked about them she tried to remember what they were, one of them being a \"mac & cheese dish with weird cheeses like gouda\" were her exact words.  the only positive is the atmosphere and decor with large booths, a fire place and a rustic feel...... this place would need a lot of changes if i were to go back. i wouldn't recommend it, i wouldn't go back...........unimpressive,  unprofessional, blah..........food is ehh....."}
{"text":"We came here about a month after it opened. There was about an hour wait for a table on a Thursday evening. We opted to sit at the bar. Received great service and excellent food. Cool decor. Would repeat"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour.  Cold beer and half price apps.  Tuna nachos...awesome.  flat breads good as well.  Would really like to see a cheddar beer and or a honey mustard dip for the fresh pretzel sticks.  Will be going back again"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that this place has such poor quality food and service, because the location is beautiful. The fact that it sits right on the river makes you want to go there. However each time I return to this place I feel like I'm wasting my money and I think, i should know better, I should have gone somewhere else. At the end of the experience I just feel taken advantage of to be lured in by the pretty looks of this place. We are locals so I've given it a few different tries thinking maybe it was an off night for them, but it's time to face the reality - this restaurant is horrible.  Last Friday July 14th at 8:00 pm my spouse and I decide to come back to burntwood becAuse we live down the street and didn't feel like cooking. I was happy that they sat us on the patio on the side of the bar overlooking the river. Service was slow from the get go. The server offered the prime rib special which my spouse wanted but by the time the server came back to take our order, they had run out of the special... really management? You ran out of a special at prime dinner hour on a Friday?! Shouldn't you be a little more prepared? So my spouse was accommodating and said ok, the steak then, medium rare. We waited and waited for our food. It took a very long time for us to get it and funny, the people who were seated 15 minutes after us got their food before us.  Finally, our food came out and my spouse's steak was overcooked.. not the medium rare he asked for ..but definitely a well done steak. Now seriously, your place can't even cook a steak to order? Shameful. I'd be embarrassed to have this kind of kitchen running.  Unbelievable. We should have sent it back but it took us so long to get our food in the first place we couldn't wait anymore. Both of us were tired and hungry and were over this place!  We just had a conversation about this poor experience last night with friends who agreed burntwood is only good for the atmosphere and the drinks. I'll be spreading my review to anyone who considers this place for dinner. I don't want them to waste their money and walk away disappointed. If you want to eat food, maybe get an app like hummus that they can't screw up or better yet, go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality of food...my recommendation would be to order appetizers and drinks at the bar. Appearance is cool but that's all..."}
{"text":"Abosolutley f'ing terrible! They need to throw away the whole restaurant. We ordered steak and frites, the bacon burger, and the chicken Milanese with the mac n cheese and a coffee. The coffee came out cold, the chicken was super dry, the mac n cheese a child wouldn't eat, the burger was sweet and instead of the medium well steak we ordered it came medium rare. The french fries that were served had a half of a full potato in the bag (see photo) and it was under cooked. Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"Second visit here for me. The service and staff are outstanding. The menu is meh. Quality of food was average. This place will do in a pinch if you are pressed for time."}
{"text":"Ahhh Burntwood Tavern. You had me at first. This restaurant suckers you in with its inviting \"ski lodge-esque\" ambiance. However it took me a few trips to realize it's in fact just a jumped up Applebees. They poor a decent beer from a nice selection of drafts, and have an appetizer/entree here and there that is ok. But it seems to me these restaurants (whether this one, the one in Solon, the one in Rocky River, and even the sister restaurant \"M\" in Chagrin Falls) are actually \"tricking\" the clientele into thinking they are having some version of haute, or even quality, cuisine. Not so. Again, it's Applebees with better decor."}
{"text":"Order the white cheddar Mac and cheese!!! Great atmosphere! Yummy! Not sure why it has so few stars. Sit outside but make sure you get the good high top chairs! I just am saying that bc this review had to be longer"}
{"text":"We went to Burntwood tonight for Happy Hour Dinner. We were glad we made reservations for 5:30 because the Tavern was hopping!   When we arrived, there were Solon cops at the door speaking two girls. We asked the hostess what the commotion was about to find out that one of the girls had her purse stolen while at the restaurant!! We did not see a manager talking to the girls when they were inside or outside, which was alarming to me.  We ordered waters and the BWT Fruit Punch to drink. The BWT Fruit Punch is sparkling wine with blood orange and passion fruit juices. It was light and refreshing. We had to ask for straws because we were not given them initially.   We ordered the Zucchini Frites as a half-price appetitizer. They were sliced into tiny straws, which a lot of it was just batter and not actually zucchini.   Our salads took a lengthy amount of time to arrive after our app. I ordered the Harvest Chicken Salad, which was mediocre at best. It was shredded iceberg lettuce with hardly any chicken breast or other toppings. It was already heavily tossed with a cider dressing making it soggy, when I asked for dressing on the side to prevent this. We also ordered the Salmon Salad too. This salad was spinach salad with a salmon filet on top.   Until next time Burntwood..."}
{"text":"Steak and frites is 24 dollars and it wasn't worth. Size was minimal and steak was poor. Chicken Milanese was pathetic. It seemed like the mozzarella was just poured on the chicken nonchalantly. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great food AND atmosphere. Beautiful glasswork throughout. Overall great experience. We DID go on one of the most beautiful days that we've had so far this year April 17, 2016."}
{"text":"This review is for their brunch, of which I've been to twice. I haven't been here for lunch or dinner.  Burntwood is a very good option for brunch for several reasons. First, there are limited options in the area for a good brunch with a patio and, secondly, they have bottomless mimosas.  Most recently, we arrived at 12:30pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately on the patio and in the shade. Our server, Lisa, was attentive without being overbearing or making us feel hurried. Overall she was great.  The food was good. My omelette was served with a salad of my choice (about six salad options). My wife had the chicken sliders and a side of tater tots. Sliders were delicious and very moist. I highly recommend them. The tots were overly \"bready\" with little potato taste. I won't have them again. The omelette was pretty average. Places that focus on breakfast will probably be better. But I was here mostly for the mimosas.  The mimosas were very good. It's easy to error on the side of champagne or juice, but these were blended very nicely and I couldn't get enough. They offer orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and cranberry (which I didn't see on the menu). My favorite was the orange, which take a bit longer because it's freshly squeezed.  Overall, the food was good and reasonably priced, the service was very good, and the mimosas were great!"}
{"text":"First visit was a Friday happy-hour visit for a friend's going away party. Service was great. Everything was correct the first time, servers were professional and helpful. Happy hour selections were good and food was quality. The decor left a lasting impression. Large exposed wood beams everywhere and it built a great overall atmosphere. I'd gladly return."}
{"text":"First of all the bartenders were rude and did not interact with people at the bar at all- never a smile while working- failed to mention happy hour specials..it's the bar that's the first thing they should've done..  so I paid $9 for a Cosmo not knowing until I got up to get a booth with friends where the service was terrible. I've been a server for years I am understanding to when a server is busy but she took a ridiculously long time and then didn't bother to apologize for the amount of time it was taking her..took 10 mins to get a tea I asked for. The appetizers are awesome but the entrees are average at best- pork chops are good ...don't get the asiago chicken!! Won't be back for awhile-need better servers/bartenders-lot more training. 2 stars for the apps & atmosphere.. That's it though."}
{"text":"It's obvious immediately upon coming into this restaurant that the staff is not ready to be opened for business.  Don't get me wrong.. food was decent, drinks were cold, and prices were fair... but it was a marvel to watch all the different staff members fumble around as we placed simple orders.  Asked the server what the seasonal Southern Tier beer on draft was.. the answer we received is 'it's the seasonal Southern Tier' lol.  Yes... sir.. we got that.. now... which one is it? People just seemed lost, didn't know answers to questions, and we're very uneducated in what's on the menu.  Decor is awesome, but it seems this place may need few more months to figure out there work 'flow'.. we may revisit in awhile."}
{"text":"I lived in Lakewood with my parents before moving east and there is a Burntwood right in rocky River. The space is large and open and the food was always delicious. When I moved to the east side and found out that there was a Burntwood here too I was so excited.   The one in chagrin falls has a different feel then the one in Rocky River but in a good way. It's smaller wth a ton of wood and brick throughout the place. You kind of feel like you are just at a neighbors house.   I went there for a rehearsal dinner and it was perfect. It was set back in a room with curtains and the food came out timely and they kept the drinks flowing which was perfect.  I've gone here many times for dinners, lunches, and work meetings because it's such a comfortable atmosphere and the food is always delicious. My favorite dish which is an appetizer but I eat as dinner are the spicy shrimp tacos. For drinks, you have to get the jack and Jill. It is so refreshing and delicious but be careful because they creep up on you fast (especially at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding).   I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is set in a great place and has a very nice view of the Cuyahoga River. I had the battered fish which was very good and my date at the time now gf had the Margherita Pizza. It was all very good. The inside and bar is nice too even though it was a little cramped at the time. Other than that it was fine. I Would definitely recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"I honestly have to disagree with some of my fellow Yelpers here. I thought this cute and quaint little restaurant was the bees knees! Not only was the exterior amazing, the food was pretty great as well.  We came here on a very special day with our couple friends, Travis and Julie. See, today was the day Travis was going to propose to Julie. So naturally, she could have whatever she wanted off the menu. Which means good things for a Yelper!  I'm going to start out with a con since it was the first thing I tried. Julies mimosa was not very good. It was too strong and lacked flavor. Not a good start but it only went up from there! Next we ordered the lobster pierogis as an appetizer. WOW! They were delicious! A slightly crispy exterior with amazing lobster filling. It wasn't too much for the people who aren't keen on seafood, but just enough. The sauce on the plate was creamy and complimented the dish so well. Just delightful!  Everyone at the table LOVED their entrées. If I remember correctly, my boyfriend had the Sicilian flatbread, Travis had the fish sandwich, Julie had a giant bowl of the lobster bisque, (no really, she asked for the biggest bowl they could give her) and I had the lunch combo with the lobster bisque and asiago crusted chicken sandwich. Now, I can really only comment on my lunch, but damn was it good. The bisque was heavy in a great way with the right amount of lobster. Creamy and oh so good. My sandwich was unique and the flavors went together like a good sandwich should. Everyone had a great time and raved about the food. I can definitely say I would come back here again. Maybe to try those tasty looking waffles I see everywhere...."}
{"text":"Decor is cute and the lighting was dim (which I love) so it does have a bit of a romantic vibe. The hostess was very rude and placed me at a table saying ABSOLUTELY nothing. I waited forever (9 minutes I was alone and very aware of the time) for a server in an almost empty restaurant! They took my order and NEVER came back. I actually had to get up and ASK for an additional glass of water. I ordered a filet with Gorgonzola cheese and it was THE saltiest steak I have ever had. The fingerling potatoes were equally salty. It was awful. For the price I could have pretty much went anywhere and had a better meal or two. I should have known better since it is a chain. The food and the service make this a \"restaurant\" you can miss out on for sure."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.  The food was so-so.  I had fish and chips which were greasy and salty. My daughter ordered Avocado chicken which was supposed to be on Flatbread but came out like a pizza. At least it was taken off the bill.  Her daughter wanted steak which not listed on the children's menu and too expensive to order on the adult menu so she had ceasar salad with steak (a small cup) which was supposed to be pink and was served red in the inside.   The whole meal was  was full of salt!  The server was very nice but took more time than normal to return to our table for ordering.  All in all it was very disappointing and will not go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday evening at 7:30, no reservation, No Problem! got seated upstairs right away, the wait staff was friendly. dinner was served promptly and was delicious. y husband had the Salmon cakes over root veggies, more than he could eat at one serving!  My Spinach fettuccine and salmon was very rich, also more than I could finish. the house dressing on the salad was just right.  Wine selection was very nice, server encouraged us to purchase an entire bottle, instead of just the two glasses we originally ordered, good idea!!   The dinning room is comfortable, divided into several smaller areas, makes for an intimate dinning experience. music selection was not what we particularly liked but was not bad.  We will most definitely return in the near future, have plans to bring out of town guests here too."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time on a date night with the wife. We arrived a bit early so we took a stroll along the river (something we did years ago when we were early dating).  The restaurant has a very cool location overlooking the river and the decor is pretty sharp. I ordered their specialty drink, a Moscow Mule, and it did not disappoint. Our reservation was for 8:15pm on a Saturday and it was a little disappointing that they were out of their soup of the day (lobster bisque). We instead started with some zucchini frites as an appetizer and they were wonderful (I could have done a 2nd order). We both ordered the 8oz filets and the garlic butter gave them an excellent taste. The asparagus was grilled and really fresh (my wife prefers them a bit softer but I thought they were perfect). The waitress was friendly enough, but the only negative was that she forgot to put in a side order for us (they were not on our bill).  Overall a great dinner and looking forward to returning again soon!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is fantastic All appetizers and flat breads are 1/2 off And the variety is extensive. I stopped in with a friend and we enjoyed the happy hour 4-6pm. I had the burger sliders and tater tots my friend had the avocado chicken flatbread. The sliders are served with velveeta, catsup, a sweet pickle chip and topped with a giant green olive. The burgers are prepared to order. I chose medium and they were a nice slight pink. They were good although the cheese was  over done, as in burnt to an unappealing black crust that I peeled off. The tater tots are not what you would expect. They are homemade and just delicious. They are made of freshly shredded seasoned potatoes. I would describe them as more like a potato pancake ball. They come served with 3 sauces: peppercorn ranch, chipotle bbq, and a tomato aioli. The chipotle bbq is indeed spicy hot so beware if you are not a heat seeker. The tomato aioli was tasty and the peppercorn ranch good as well. I actually preferred the tasty bites on their own although I will admit they were a little on the salty side.  My friend enjoyed The avocado chicken flatbread it came with fresh avocado slices and while I didn't try it my friend said it was delicious.  Tavern Wine is also 1/2 price as well as other beer and drink specials it's definitely worth the stop to enjoy  We finished our visit with 2 of the  tasty dessert bites they offer in the cute little mini mugs.  I chose the brownie bite with raspberry ice cream. My friend chose a blondie style with a salted caramel ice cream. BOTH were so delicious we also licked the cups.   We sat out on the huge patio and really enjoyed the ambiance."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. Everything about my first experience here was amazing. My boyfriend and I both started off with a jack and Jill, followed by the shrimp taco appetizer. Amazing. Flawless. I am in love with these tacos!!! My boyfriend got the steak and tots. Best steak I have ever eaten AND the tots!? Woah! Amazing! Who could have thought tots could be so amazing. As for me, I got a bowl of lobster bisque and a French dip type sandwich. Both phenomenal. We then ordered a bourbon and a pear/cucumber drink. Both amazing again. And the dessert!!! $2.50 for a little cup of heaven! We WILL be back. I wish I could rewind time and eat it all again!! :) service and atmosphere is great as well :) thank you Joseph!"}
{"text":"Burntwood Tavern is an amazingly popular place, but after visiting both Solon and now Chagrin Falls locations, I have been mostly disappointed and would not recommend.  Breakdown below:  Food: Menu has very limited vegetarian options, just OK food at higher prices.  When the appetizers we ordered were delivered, one was already lukewarm/cold.   Service: per above, service was SLOW.  Restaurant was jamming but apps took 25 mins to be served.  Hostess was unfriendly and unhelpful, we had to eat on a couch and she made no effort to find a table for us before food arrived (it was obvious that she truly could not care less).  Waiter was a taller dark haired skinny young man who was friendly polite and professional, he saved the place from a 1 star review.  Ambiance: actually quite nice rustic decor, but place was so busy that it was nearly impossible to talk amongst the group of 4 I was eating with."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviews, awesome ambiance from a design perspective but just OK on food quality/offerings, not great price value.  I would choose another eatery before Burntwood."}
{"text":"Wow, great happy hour with solid drink and food specials.  The spicy shrimp tacos are amazing.  Tuna nachos were recommended and although different, really good.  Service was fine and it's a great atmosphere.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to the Burntwood in Rocky River a few times, but this was my first time at the Chagrin Falls location. I was pleased with the experience! We didn't have to wait for a table, despite it being quite busy with whatever city-wide celebration was happening in the town. Waitress was very attentive and we received our food and drinks in an appropriate amount of time. I got a veggie burger that, despite falling apart all over my plate (that's why they make forks), was fantastic. Person I was with got asiago-crusted chicken, which looked absolutely delicious. He ate all of it, so I'm assuming it was. They have a good beer and drink selection, and I was able to get my favorite Bell's Oberon. I was very satisfied with my experience here! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place while on vacation and I was so impressed with the ambience. I wish we had one like this in LA. The outside patio was beautiful and the food was delicious. Also the mimosas were quite good too. Now I never get dessert but I got this apple crumple topped with salted caramel ice cream and wowza was that good. I highly recommend this place. What a great spot for lunch or dinner or drinks. And the staff, we had Michelle, was absolutely pleasant. I'd come again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"was not impressed at all. portions were tiny. asiago chicken which was a \"favorite\" as spoken by our server was dry and very crispy. had the tilapia and it had a \"salmon\" taste like it was stored together.  appetizers were not enough to share, very small had heard others rave about it,don't think I will"}
{"text":"Just got a Burntwood Burger at the Burntwood Tavern. Taste like a big glob of shit! For $13.00. A $13,00 pile of shit Burger, Could of had 2 Whoppers from Burger King on sale for $6.00  would of been a much better choice. Don't waste your money! 2 Burgers 3 beers and a kids dinner $68.00!"}
{"text":"We went for the Sunday brunch. Food was timely and tasty. Only complaint was the private party in the loft above us. Very noisy!"}
{"text":"I was torn between 3 and 4 stars for this place, and decided to go with four based off the excellent service I received. I rolled in with one eye open after spending 3 hours at the Art Museum and was on the border of passing out from a combination of exhaustion and starvation.  I was seated immediately and greeted by my server.  The decor here is pretty rustic, with huge planks of wood sticking out of the wall, giving it a cabin feel to the place.  I scoured the menu and couldn't decide what to get.  Part of the reason I rounded down is because I wasn't really impressed with their menu selection. I had a hard time deciding what to get, and finally went with a burger and fries.  Also, they only have home made pop here, nothing name brand.  (no coke or pepsi on tap.)  Even though the food was good, I LOVED my server.  She rocked it out and I really enjoyed her company.  I guess she's been there a long time, and I would go back just to sit in her section.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but I was much happier with the service I received.  Overall, I had a good time here, and tried to go back in Friday night, but it was so packed i couldn't get seated, so I passed. I don't want to say I regret it, but I just didn't have the energy to wait."}
{"text":"This is one of my Moms favorite places to eat so we took her for Xmas. I, however, want totally impressed.   The good: venue. The space is gorgeous, welcoming and warm. It was a great setting for a holiday lunch. Service was good too.   The better: apps & drinks. There are some very tasty choices. We had tots and zucchini fries. They had a couple of Xmas ales and an ok list of wines.   The not good: holy bananas my food was so salty I could barely eat it. I had roasted vegetables that were cooked perfectly but tasted like they were dunked in salt. It drew the water out of my mouth! I also ordered a burger but couldn't much get the taste as it was salty as well.   It seemed no one else at the table had the same issue, maybe it was my dish in particular but it definitely makes me reluctant to go back next time we are up to visit."}
{"text":"I went to Burntwood to celebrate a coworkers upcoming wedding. We had a party of ten & the first to arrive was sternly told she wouldn't be seated until the entire group arrived. They were finally seated since we had people arriving between 4:30 & 5:45. Thankfully, the servers were much friendlier! We were there for happy hour & mostly had the half priced starters with drinks. We ordered the tater tots, zucchini strips, tuna nachos, artichoke fondue, pork wings & calamari. All the appetizers were amazing, especially the pork wings! So smokey & tender!! The bloody Mary's were great! Everyone else loved their drinks too! I'll be back for sure!   Was back here recently & found they removed my beloved pork wings from the menu. Please bring them back!!! They were amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious. Service fast and friendly. I'd definitely return. I've also gone for a drink at the bar and the bartenders are very attentive and prompt to serve you."}
{"text":"This place  stinks(continue reading)! I have given a few tries since it's opening, all regrettable.   I have dealt with slow service,  items on the menu not being served, and even one time my waitress literally stank of alcohol (this was a lunch time visit.)  The Spanish tavern building must truly be cursed. This restaurant is a shipwreck.   I will be sticking with Courtyard."}
{"text":"Obsessed with the steak salad! I also highly recommend the tuna nachos, they are a large enough portion for dinner! Can't wait to check this place out during happy hour"}
{"text":"I'd love to give Burntwood 4 stars, but the server for my book club was just awful. I'll have a hard time getting past that experience. Hubby was lured by their special soft shell crab menu around Mother's Day, so we went back.  Better for a small group. I enjoyed a special cocktail and the friend green beans were spot on.  The cute little desserts are always a great way to finish."}
{"text":"It was okay. I was not impressed. Service was great. Food was eh.... I'm glad I tried it just to say I tried... I won't drive all the way out here to give it another try, I live in Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"Delicious!  This is my go to restaurant in the Twinsburg/Solon area right now.  It is upscale but kid friendly at the same time."}
{"text":"We ate here this evening, and everything was amazing. I got the French Dip sandwich, and it was literally the best I've ever had. My husband got the Diablo Chicken and it was giant and he loved it.  Even my daughter's cheese quesadilla looked good. This place has amazing views of the river, and the atmosphere is perfect for a date night."}
{"text":"It was my first experience here and it was for my to go pickups!! This place wasn't organized and not enough staff. Or maybe they didn't care. No hostess, you walk in and have no idea where you are suppose to go to get help. One bartender takes care of all the drinks and supposedly Togo orders too. She didn't even tried to help me or get my food. I waited half an hr for the food.  I asked if my food was ready then her reply was with an attitude, if the food is ready they will bring it out.  I just shook my head and left the place. They brought the food out and I just didn't care for it anymore. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"This is one of the most beautiful restaurants in all of northeast Ohio.  The interior is gorgeous, and there is a wonderful view of the Cuyahoga Falls riverfront.  The staff is excellent, and the menu is large.  The downside to this restaurant is that there is always a long wait (I'm not sure if they take reservations)  But I guess that isn't a downside since it means that the food and service are great and people keep returning.  :)  I only gave it 4 stars because it took forever to get our food, and we didn't order anything that should have taken that long.  We went on a Sunday evening."}
{"text":"We hosted a bridal shower at Burntwood Solon and the staff could not have been more accommodating! The banquet manager, Chad, took care of our special requests graciously and promptly; Amy, MOD, responded on the day of the Shower to many of our last minute requests (music volume, table arrangements, etc) and the wait staff, Kristi and Sonya were very friendly and professional! Our food was served in a timely manner and tasted great... the atmosphere perfect for our event!  I highly recommend Burntwood Tavern for special events"}
{"text":"My mom and I went there for lunch and had a great experience! She had the house salad and white bean chili she said it was hot (but she let me try it and and it wasn't that spicy). I had the El Diablo burger and it was really good and prepared the way I like it!! Would definitely recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Service at the bar was good but food was average - typical American food (salads, sandwiches, etc) but kind of underwhelming. Would probably go for happy hour but not for much else."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I have only been here once, but my experience was great.   My mom and I had a list of restaurants to try because we were going to get my grandparents a bunch of gift cards to different places for their 60th anniversary. Burntwood Tavern was on our list. We only ordered drinks and appetizers since we were restaurant hopping, but I was satisfied with just that!  We sat outside RIGHT by the water - we sat right next to the rail looking over the water at a high top table. I loved it!   I ordered the Moscow Mule as a drink and it was delicious. The copper mug it came in was so cute (you can buy them too if you'd like) and it was ICE cold which was great for me.   We ordered the tuna nachos, blackened shrimp tacos, and the zucchini frites. The nachos are a must-have! The presentation is cute and they are a perfect size to share with someone or they could be an entire meal if you ordered a salad as well.   The shrimp tacos were also very flavorful. The flavors and sauce were really good but to me the whole thing was too spicy. However, I'm a baby when it comes to spicy things.  The zucchini frites were fairly average. They were good, but if I were to go again I would definitely order something like the nachos or the tacos over those (also, the presentation isn't nearly as nice as the other two dishes)  The decor is so cozy and the place is HUGE. It's definitely a must-go if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the area...my Friday night go to spot.  Love their shrimp tacos and their lobster bisque."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...ordered the chicken  picatta with blistered asparagus and root vegetables-happily ate every bite! The only Complaint I had was the tuna and wonton appetizer because the avocados that came with it were not ripe and too hard! We sent it back and they happily took it off the bill."}
{"text":"I am especially hopeful this review is read by one \" Myra E,\" who in her 6/2 comments about Burntwood felt it perfectly acceptable to write \"complainers that have reviewed this restaurant need to eat at McDonalds or better yet stay home...\"   Really? Wow, mighty strong words, but I guess since she has established a ton of credibility by not only posting hundreds of reviews judged by her peers as \"useful\" but reviews so full of penetrating insight into the local culinary scene that Cleveland's Iron Chef pays heed, then, dammit, we all SHOULD take her advice!. I mean, who wouldn't?   Wait, what? She has only reviewed one restaurant? Not one other, but just ONE?  ONE LOUSY REVIEW??  And, if we don't agree with her we should \"eat at McDonalds or better yet stay home?\"   There's a word for reviewers like that, folks, and it's \"poseur.\" I understand Myra may have to look that one up. Reminds me of the legendary Steve Allen who started what later became The Tonight Show. He'd share some inside joke with the band and one of them would say, \"Hey, Steve, do they get this in Cincinnati?\" And, Steve would reply with, \"Well, it goes there but they sure don't get it.\"   Tonight was our first visit to Burntwood. As we live in the area and there is a dearth of solid local restaurants, our hopes were sky high. We want Burntwood to succeed. Thus it pains me to say our first visit was less than mediocre. Before Myra has a stroke I say with certainty we will go back. She got one thing correct in her review and that was that \"Occasionally a restaurant can make a mistake...\" And, occasionally they make several.   Walked into the lobby and a manager-appearing gentleman was behind the lectern speaking with two young ladies who appeared to be hostesses.  I was the only customer in the lobby. There was no more than 15 feet between us. I was ignored long enough that if I had not had to wait for my wife I would have turned around and left.  No, they don't have to jump to attention and throw rose petals in my path but a simple \"Hello,\" would have been nice.  Nothing. Strike one. I walked back outside to wait.   OK, got seated in the very nice bar area and our server took our order. My wife ordered the crab cakes and a Caesar Salad and I had the \"Smoked Pig Wings\" and a chopped salad. The crab cakes were not great but fine and she thought the salad was just ok.  The \"Pig Wings\" (similar to small ribs but with more meat) were overcooked and very dry.  I should have sent them back but sometimes you just don't want to bother and tonight was one of those times. And, by the way, Burntwood, please learn what a chopped salad is. What you served wasn't. What it was was a regular tossed salad with watery dressing. Strike two.   The server came by and asked how everything was and I said, \"Very mediocre.\" His reply was to nod his head. Not shake his head, nod his head. Was he agreeing with me? I said, \"Are these \"Pig Wings\" usually dry like this or was this just an off night?\" His response was \"I don't know.\" Yes, that's what he said. He then added, \"Maybe that's why we give you three sauces.\"   Strike three.   So, Myra, it was right about then when Mickey D's was looking like a viable alternative. And, yes, I am kidding--although I would rather eat their food then read another of your reviews.   Considering our last dinner out was Saturday at Giovanni's (5 star review coming, and I mean the FOOD gets five stars, Myra, not my review), this was kinda disappointing.   However.   We WILL go back because as I wrote above, Myra was right in that sometimes stuff happens. And, since we are local and this would be a great place to visit a few times a month, we will return to try other items (and other servers) at least one or two more times.  It just won't be real soon."}
{"text":"For the price, good food & a great view. If you are looking for the best food in town, you'll have to pay more than $$. Here, you have happy hour 3-6 everyday and a much better vibe than other middle market chains. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Family visit for my Dad's birthday. Food was delicious and service wonderful. I recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior. Excellent service, but food that tastes like something you'd find when you get off the interstate in Oklahoma. Well actually it doesn't like anything. We ordered three entrees and all three tasted like a MRE. I don't get any pleasure bashing restaurants but the Burntwood took our money and our Saturday night. We'll get over it but we won't be back. The place was crowded so you can take my review with a grain of salt, whoa wait, give me the salt so I can get some kind of flavor into this French Dip. I'd be willing to bet some of the menu items are frozen in a plastic bag and boiled or it heated up just before serving. Jeesh."}
{"text":"I had a great meal. Our server Jenn was great. I had the Fish and Chips. I only wish the chips were more like what you would get with fish and chips in England. (These were just fries).  The fish was great. The tarter sauce was spicy hot, but I liked it.   The drinks were great. I complement the bar tender. I had A \"Dark and Stormy\" mule in a copper cup. It was great."}
{"text":"My Husband and I had a rare night out and Burntwood Tavern popped into my head because I had been there two times with girlfriends. Once just for drinks in the bar and once for dinner in the covered outdoor bar. Both times nice drinks and tasty food. So. Complimentary  valet is always nice. Interior decor is fabulous. We were seated at a table for two with a fringed tent like overhead. There were many groups of friends sharing a meal and a large birthday party on the open second floor. As an interior design artist I am in love with the décor. So many custom design pieces like the welded distressed metal light fixtures. So. Meal wise. Our waitress was slow but we inquired and learned there were a few call offs so she was working the large party upstairs, several group tables. And us. My VIP martini with gorgonzola stuffed olives dirty was delicious. Wine list is nice and not super expensive. The special was lobster bisque and prime rib. So even though the menu has a lot of delicious looking items, those are two of my favorite dishes so I ordered them. The calamari was good. But the tomato relish dip was really tasty. The bisque was not so great as it tasted like they had put cheesewiz in it. It was too thick and cheezy. Also, our calamari came after my soup. Then we waited almost an hour for our main dishes. I told our waitress when it came that it had been way too long. She agreed and apologized. Later she said the manager offered to buy us dessert but we were full so our waitress took off the cost of the calamari.  Over Two hour dinner. All together it was nice but a restaurant needs to have backup for short staff nights. We will still go there again and try some of delicious sounding flatbreads."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5  We had a reservation here Friday night to celebrate a college graduation! We were sat immediately and were all blown away by the five star atmosphere! If you get a chance mosey over and admire the beautiful copper top bar then work your way over to the patio for a nice view of the Cuyahoga river! I would come here for the atmosphere alone.   The mixed drinks weren't as good as we expected. We started with the tuna nachos and calamari, both were satisfying but run of the mill and we wouldn't get these again.   All of our entrees were very good! I had the smoked prime rib, such a unique smokey flavor and such a treat!! This was a special but I would definitely recommend it! Two people in our party had the fish and chips. These were the largest pieces of fish I had ever seen, both were easily as long as your forearm. The fries went awesome with the vinegar but pass on the slaw.  My brother got the Burntwood tavern burger with the hash brown patty, I think he liked it seeing as he practically licked his plate.   Great atmosphere, A-ok food, and average service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very nicely decorated, however the food was not very well done, the staff were confused with our orders, and when the one group member ordered  their meal the waiter brought something totally different than previously ordered. The restaurant had lots of tables, but 75% of the tables were completely empty and very under staffed at the time.  They were unable to seat all but 25 percent of the restaurant due to the heavy understaffing. There pricing was totally outrageous for the garbage they put out the bill was over 100 dollars... when all orders were messed up. The major problem was that we put our order in with one server and a runner came out with food and had no idea who had what, you can imagine the confusion when we tried to explain the mistake. We were quoted a wait time of 30 minutes. Yeah that was more like an hour. This was the second location of this restaurant, which now what i believe is four. Why is are people going here?   Side note: A family member ordered to - go form here. The food came greasy and drastically over cooked. Not worth the price.  I really wish solon would get some good quality restaurants instead of these cookie cutter themed boxes"}
{"text":"So I have given Burntwood tavern (chain) chance after chance after chance. I have tried their Solon store, their brecksville store, and now I have tried their cuyahoga falls store. One thing stands as being in common. Its simple... why are these locations considered high end establishments when nothing about them screams high end. In three places now I have experienced food that is no better than your local mega chain restaurant. Service that seems confused and at times oddly rude. Cuyahoga falls location was no different. I would say the best part of this one was the location. It sits right on the River. Nice views. That is where the nice ends. We called ahead of time to check wait times and availability of booths. We were told that tables were no wait but booths were full. We got there and were kind of turned off at the fact that the valet parking which was free took up most of the parking. Leaving you almost no choice but to valet. I think I even saw the valet parking cars in Handicapped spots. I do not care how limited the parking is. Handicapped spots cannot be valet parked with cars with no handicapped sticker. When we entered into the place we were met with a carbon greeting. Nothing out of the ordinary. The menu was smallish and at times confusing. The person I was with asked the server if the chili had mustard in it as I am allergic. She at first said o no, than said ill check, than came back and said the chef said yes. So since I could not have the chili i changed my order as did the person I was with. \"O I just put the order in I do not know if we can change it? I'll check.\" Can i have my pasta with low sauce? \" O I already put it in Ill check?\" Is it that hard to change an order? Is that not part of a servers job. So the food came. It was pretty much tasteless. My burger was dead. It had been dead for a long time. The fries are nothing more than potatoes cut into french fry shape with no seasoning and nicely burned in a fancy restaurant sort of way. Of course I'm kidding there. Burnt fries are never nice. Even if the place is called Burntwood tavern. The servers looked overwhelmed. Like even though the place had been opened almost a year. Even though it was probably packed every night they could not figure out how to handle everybody. Confused about which orders went to which table. I can't tell you how many times the other person was asked if they wanted a box. In the end I was at a total loss for how these numerous locations are doing well. I have never had a good experience. Not once."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of BWT and the outdoor patio. Perfect environment to have a few cocktails and chit chat. Also, I think they had a lot of great menu options at a fare price. My visit went a little south when it took over a half hour to receive our food because the kitchen lost our ticket. However, our waitress came over and apologized as did the manager. Really appreciated the good customer service and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Generally speaking, I can go to any burntwood taverns across NEO and expect a similar experience. However, the service my family received last night was absolutely horrific. Our waitress was incredibly rude, not welcoming, every time we asked for something she made an excuse why she didn't bring it yet. Also, on Saturday and Sunday's there is now mandatory complimentary parking. It's a pain in the butt this locations parking situation. The valet men were incredibly rude and they walked past complaining loudly about how they are underpaid and never tipped enough. I do not plan on ever coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food , atmosphere, very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great Happy Hour Specials and Great Service. Morgan and the other ladies behind the bar are fantastic. The BWT signatures and flatbread are great."}
{"text":"The only place in Solon that has decent food and is open late. They also have a wide selection of wines and a full bar. I usually am across the street at Panini's but this place has a classier vibe to it and is not that much more expensive. If you are in Solon and looking for a place that serves amazing food this is the only place I know of and have tried with decent food in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite part of this restaurant is the decor. I would love to decorate a house this way. Both rustic and glamorous. The reason for 1 less star is that I feel like they could offer a little something more unique in their menu. I got a prime rib pasta dish and didn't feel like it was a 5 star plate. Their flatbread is wonderful. 1/2 off apps and cheap drinks 7 days a week from 3pm-6pm. We will visit again."}
{"text":"They have good food at reasonable prices. I like that they don't just serve the usual. The fries are amazing. Their Friday night mussels are a great appetizer"}
{"text":"The experience I had today while at Burnwood for brunch was less than mediocre. I had come to the restaurant a few months back with my mother and was extremely impressed with everything. I had been bragging about the place to my boyfriend, and convinced him to try it out this AM with me. To my surprise, the experience we had today was very far from what I had experienced that first time.  After waiting 15 minutes to simply take our order, we had to wait another 45 minutes for our food, on a morning when it didn't seem busy.   I ordered a crab omelet and my boyfriend ordered salmon eggs Benedict. Both were dry, and the presentation of the food was less than appetizing. It looked as though they just threw my omelet on the plate quickly. It came with a side of the fruit and my supposed 'Fruit cup\" had 5 tiny pieces of fruit in it, enough where I had to ask the manager for some more fruit. My crispy potatoes where burnt, and the omelet itself was far far from impressive as the egg was overcooked.   We informed a manager about our experience and of how unhappy we were, and we just didn't feel as if she cared too much. She did take off one of our meals however we left hungry and felt as if we had wasted our morning and a good Sunday brunch.   Needless to say, we will not be returning. Bad food is one thing, but unsympathetic service is another. There are so many wonderful brunch spots in Lakewood/Rocky River, so spend your money and your time elsewhere where they'll actually take care of you (and make sure you don't leave hungry!!!)"}
{"text":"Great place. Went with a large group and everything went well.  Food is excellent.  Fast service even with group.  Highly recommended.  Coming back soon! !"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the interior design. It's an interesting mix industrial, rustic and old west - very unique and not what I expected for a Rocky River establishment. Good sized patio that is enclosed and takes advantage of a fireplace to set up a cozy experience. Lots of space in the proper seating area. The booths are enveloping! You'll feel like VIP with the plush seats, high wooden walls and wooden lighting above.   The restaurant description took precedence because the food wasn't as memorable. Chicken quesadilla was presented upright in four cut up rolls. Beef sliders (Velveeta cheese!) came in a three pack, pretty standard. Perhaps the other menu options are better, but it is what it is. Big shot out to Reggie! He's very personable and a  server with great attention to detail and work ethic."}
{"text":"Solid tavern food. Half price appetizers."}
{"text":"Most meals I've had here are pretty good. Nice environment. Be careful if taking advantage of \"Kids eat free Mondays\", they've tried charging our kids meals twice. Made reservations for Easter brunch, which were later cancelled by Burntwood Tavern with no explanation. They didn't offer any other times and offered no apology. When I called back, their representative only offered blame on the person taking our reservation. Again, no apology given. I won't be giving my business back to Burntwood any time soon."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was awesome (great setup and live music) and the food was on point. The shrimp taco appetizer and Chipotle BBQ Tilapia were wonderful!  If I'm ever back in town this place will def be on my must have list!"}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food. Happy hour is good if you can get your server to come to your table more than once."}
{"text":"We have been to burntwood several times in several different cities. We really like the fairlawn location. The inside decor is very nice and bartender was awesome this visit! He made sure to get multiple drink orders and food orders to get the happy hour pricing. The drinks are one of our favorite parts about burntwood. They make a really good Moscow mule and we have never been disappointed with any of the cocktails. I feel that the best part of the menu is the appetizers and I will usually order 2-3 for my dinner. The tavern tater tots are a must try and come with three different dipping sauces. I also had the firecracker shrimp and tuna nachos, which were both very good."}
{"text":"Not bad, the wine list is not expansive but reasonable. Most wines were under $40, get a bottle it is a better value and you can take whats left over home.  We ordered the famous french fry truffle appetizer the only problem is that it came after our entrees. Our entrees flew to the table a little too quick, couldn't really enjoy the wine or appetizer. I had the orange horseradish crusted halibut with spaghetti squash. the fish was a little over cooked but the sauce helped.  Overall it was an ok dining experience. We may try it again."}
{"text":"Excellent menu, great service and consistently good food. Great draft beers, wines by the glass. Jim is great behind the bar.  Go. You will be happy,"}
{"text":"Food was great, prices were reasonable, great happy hour specials, and service was good but nothing to rave about. Atmosphere was cozy and rustic."}
{"text":"Decent vegetarian options...black bean wheat wrap was one of the better veggie wraps I have had at a restraunt.  Sweet potato fries, good- but sweet potato fries are hard to mess up.  My boyfriend ordered the salmon wrap and said that the salmon must have been frozen and the flavor needed to be masked.  Although the band was decent, it was extremely too loud if you were sitting in the bar area...Not the best venue for live music.  Drinks specials were great. I enjoyed the campfire martini for dessert!  I would go back."}
{"text":"First I headed to the bar for a draft beer. Helpful BT let me sample a couple of local fares prior to my final selection. They also have a  very tasty looking Sunday happy hour food selection too.   We have bar food as this is a celebrated event. Presentation is solid and inviting. Election of 6 items plus salads. I'd definitely choose this as an option to consider for small to medium event."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was a pleasant experience. The service was quick and attentive with our waiter helping us choose our drinks and order.   The food was fantastic and the atmosphere was wonderful. We ordered the quesadilla appetizer and the Nashville sandwich and the Tavern Dip. I HIGHLY recommend the Tavern Dip the prime rib was done perfectly. I also recommend the chopped salad as it is only $6, a good portion size, and a mix of a Greek salad with a regular chopped salad.   No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Tried out Burntwood with a friend for lunch and order the lunch combo with a chopped salad and California chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich left a bit to be desired. It was really small and there were not any toppings, etc. I would have complained but we waited over 35 minutes for our lunch on a weekday during our lunch break. The chopped salad was very good. The butternut squash and green beans added great texture. I'll be back, but likely in the evening when I'm not on a time crunch."}
{"text":"It's 2 pm on a Saturday. We've been shopping all day and needed nourishment. The crew was \"hangry\" as we pulled into the parking lot so it was going to be a tall order for Burntwood to satisfy us. Part of the Chef Art Pour restaurant group, the Tavern was very accommodating and mostly was able to rise to the challenge. The food was delicious but not over the top. We were glad we didn't order the fish as it had a strong odor as it passed our table. The service was adequate but not really attentive. And we ordered a few of our favorite brews only to be told the tap busted or that they were out, forcing us to settle for a third choice. All in all, an average experience but not one that will keep us from coming back."}
{"text":"My view of Burntwood has done a 180.  Maybe because I strictly go to the bar now. Regardless, I love the bar atmosphere. I was a regular Sunday \"brunch\" for a few months. Libby and Lauren are great behind the bar. Food is excellent. Tavern Dip happens to be my favorite thing on the menu  - and the Bloody Mary bar. Their Chili is also great. Plus, their loyalty program is pretty awesome. $25 bucks off for every $250 spent ... it's nice to be rewarded for being a loyal customer."}
{"text":"We will return again, again and again.   Stopped in for dinner on a Wednesday evening, requested a table close to a TV so we could watch the Cavs game. The hostess was friendly and quick to find us the perfect table.   The decor in this place is amazing! Their light fixtures are beautiful, the ambiance was great, the bar was huge, there's great outdoor seating.  Our server, Jenn H., was amazing! Super friendly, knowledgeable, very professional and just a sweet individual. We will definitely always be requesting for her next time we stop in.   We ordered a few drinks, their house wine is actually pretty good which is easy on the wallet. We also started with two appetizers, the zucchini fries and the tavern chips. Both really delicious! Side note, if you do not like blue cheese then skip the tavern chips since they are made with Gorgonzola cheese, but I thought they were delicious.   Now let me tell you about our mouthwatering entrees! I had the house salad, which was the best house salad I've ever had! The dressing was sweeter and super light and delicious. My guy ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, amazing! So smokey and delicious. One girl ordered the caesar salad and it was a HUGE portion for only 6$. And the last girl ordered the salmon, lets talk about how amazing this cedar salmon was. She wanted to order seconds that's how good it was.   All in all, you really need to try this place. The service was amazing, the decor is out of this world, the drinks were delicious and the food was mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"Great for clients and business meetings. I've meet here on more than a few occasions and the atmosphere is great in the bar.   Reason for 1 star rating - the last time I was here, I brought my wife and 2 children (under 3) during happy hour since apps are half price. My 2 1/2 yo son loves the salmon and the wings. We came on a Friday around 4pm. My boys were acting up a little as we were walking in to the restaurant to get a table. We asked for a table for 4 and was told that they were completely booked and didn't have an idea on a wait time. I looked at the eating area to the left and no one was seated there. There were open tables outside to the left and in the eating area to the right. I questioned the hostess and she said very bluntly that the restaurant did not have any availability and offered no details or wait time.    I felt as if I was not seated because of my small children. I have not been back personally and have moved my business meetings elsewhere as well."}
{"text":"My group and I were here for homecoming dinner, as we've done every year. Excited as I was, I expected good treatment. However, my reservation was for 7:45 and I was not seated until 8:15. After 9:00 we are not let into homecoming. By the time I got my food, it was 9 and I couldn't eat. Although, the chicken avocado flat bread was an amazing in car after hoco treat"}
{"text":"This place is great. I come to this area on business and always try to get lunch or dinner here. The food is amazing. They don't have the best beer selection but their wine is good. Everything I have ordered here has been beyond expectations."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time and most likely won't ever go back.  The food and drinks are over priced, and the service was horrible.  The waitress forgot our drinks.  We had to get up from the table to get them.  The bartender saw us do that and she continued to clean plates at the bar while we waited even longer for her to attend to us.  Sad, because with the right service and reorganization this place could be nice.  Hopefully the management takes notice quick or it won't be in business much longer."}
{"text":"Three stars for the food, five for the customer service! Stopped here on a hot day, mid bike-ride. Neither of us had overworked appetites, more so sore butts and parched throats. Charming appearance outside and in as well. Greeted inside by the faint but firm presence of wood-smoke, presumably from their fireplace. Dined on the back patio. The lady got their hummus appetizer as her entree. Interesting presentation, cucumbers sliced length-wise, pita, and fried plantain served with it for dipping all quaintly arranged on a sheet of slate. Nice touch! The plantain had been fried well in advance of the presentation, and possibly refreigerated. Not a huge fan of plantain, and certainly not when it is fried ahead of time and resolves to it's tough, crunchy/chewy/banana/potato-hybrid self, but the lady liked it and it was her entree! The pita either was made on premise or something as it really wasn't pita. It was thick, refrigerated, pocketless and heavy, and not particularly flavorful. If it was made onsite, they might either re-think the recipe or skip the effort and buy some from Aladdin's, like everyone else does. Given a choice between the two, we both would have picked the latter 10 times out of 10. Realizing this was serving as the lady's entree, the waitress was kind enough to bring extra pita without being requested, although due to the nature of the beast, alas, unnecessary. In the interest of stumping the kitchen folk, I decided I wanted the greens portion of their chicken breast salad with the salmon of their salmon salad. Waitress understood and indicated that there would be no problem. When it came it was chicken. They offered to swap it out, but in the interest of not having my salmon potentially spit upon by a disgruntled chef, I gratefully declined and kept the chicken. There was plenty of it, it had been breaded with something and either pan-fried or oven-fried, then refrigerated, ok but nothing extraordinary.  I prefer cooked items to reflect their preparation via their temperature, but chef didn't ask, and neither did I. Homemade bleu cheese dressing was wonderful, but ungenerously applied. Got the bill, paid it, then deciding that thirty bucks plus, without tip, for an app and a salad and two iced teas seemed a bit heavy, took a peek at the bill. What? They showed the chicken on my salad being swapped for chicken, (not salmon), and sur-charged the swap for $5.00!!! Unfortunately, the waitress was nowhere to be found as the transaction was complete and the patio was barren of other customers, so brought it to the attention of the lady who had aided in the serving of the meal and after 5 or10 minutes of animated activity at the register with a manager, I was presented with a new bill that comped my salad in it's entirety! Wow! The hallmark of good customer service is to do more to rectify a situation than the customer expects. Burntwood certainly did this!! Kudos to the management for the graciousness of their response! In contemplation of what had transpired, I came to the conclusion that the kitchen had interepreted the waitress's instruction as extra chicken rather than substitute salmon for chicken, and billed the extra $5 for extra chcken. I just thought they were attempting to justify the eleven bucks for a chicken salad with a bit more chicken than average. Would love to see her handwriting, but a very sweet young lady!"}
{"text":"Having a quick dinner after arriving  from Pittsburg tonight, have to say Wow! The kitchen has really stepped up to the plate! My husband and I had dinner here after they had opened on several occasions giving it the benefit of the doubt and to no avail it just wasn't great. The Kitchen staff perhaps or a new chef... They have really really stepped up to the plate, tonight we so much enjoyed our dinners the fish and chips and burger prepared to perfection and delicious! Most especially had the pleasure of speaking with both the bartender Annie and Bar Manager Matt they really are exceptional in Customer Service and listening, because of the Chef, and staff we will be back!! Thanks for a great evening in our neighborhood so nice not to have to go too far especially on a snowy night!"}
{"text":"To me, ambience is half of a dining experience - which is half of the reason why Burntwood Tavern is so awesome.  From the exterior to the dining area and patio, the joint has a very unique and cool upscale urban-rustic design that one may find in NyC or Boston.         Their bar is huge and there's even a cozy little corner with a fireplace and couches that's perfect for grabbing a drink or two with friends before dinner amongst a polar vortex.  Speaking of drinks - whomever their mixologists are, they're superb and the drinks are fantastic. My favorite is their Christmas Manhattan that has a wonderful kick of seasonal spice while still carrying a solid bourbon flavor.  Every other drink I've had has been equally as good as well.       The Happy Hour here is awesome too and a great reason to come during lunch or after work; half off their delicious appetizers, flatbreads, and a great deal on their cocktails.       Each meal I've had here has been delicious and flavorful too - my favorite being their version of fish and chips that served the biggest portion of cod I've seen.        Burntwood Tavern is a fine choice for whatever you're looking for, be it a great Happy Hour with friends in a cozy ambience or a chic dinner date out."}
{"text":"Nice open seating near the bar with tables outside. Good selections on the menu, nice assortment of wines to choose from. After a long day of house hunting we just wanted a glass of wine and a good meal. I got the filet, medium rare came with a few red potatoes that were flatten underneath the steak. The steak was cooked just right, potatoes were good as were the charred asparagus.  My wife enjoyed the fillet medallions encrusted with gorgonzola and demi glace, cooked medium rare as well.  Service was prompt and efficient we were in and out in under an hour at back at the hotel."}
{"text":"I visited this location last night for a birthday party, I must say that compared to the Chagrin Falls location, I would gladly return. Not only was the service better but so was the food & atmosphere as well. They lay out is better, it's not as busy and our server was incredibly adorable. My mom took the receipt so I didn't get a chance to catch his name but whomever he is (tall, skinny, red head) he really bent over backwards for a guest of ours that is on a VERY strict diet.  Due to the strict diet, the sous chef  came out to our table and took the time to personally make sure he understood her needs & executed them perfectly. I tried there lemonade which was...odd. It wasn't flavorless but it didn't taste like lemons either. I also chose their Chicken Tasso Pasta (minus the mushrooms)- it wasn't over the top, in fact the sauce was kind of lacking in flavor. The meal itself was more like a soup than a pasta dish but the chicken was cooked just right. The ham on the other hand was tough and chewy so that kinda grossed me out. But overall everyone enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Can't believe I forgot to write a review about the first time I visited this place (a yr ago) , back then it would've received a 4 1/2 star review. My only complaints being that I was seated directly next to a man who was signing & playing music. Although I enjoyed his performance, it felt like the entire restaurant was watching me eat, I couldn't hear my boyfriend talk and it was super cold as the table was directly behind the hostess stand. However, we returned tonight and I must say that I am extremely disappointed & probably will wait another year to see if they can get back on their culinary feet.     I ordered their french dip but was so grossed out by the amount of fat that was still on the meat that I didn't even try it. It seriously looked like someone sneezed on my food. The sweet pot. fries that came with it had a ridiculous amount of salt on them but still tasted great. That is until you got past the few that where on the very top, then that unwelcoming frozen taste occurred and I didn't even eat half the bag.   I also ordered the yucca fries to share with my husband, we were really excited to see  them on the menu as yucca chips are a personal fav. Again, seriously disappointed! The fries were way too big and not fully cooked. I thought dipping them in the sauce that accessorized them would help but it only made things worse. It was some mixture of peppers...way too over powering! My husband being the bottomless pit that he is didn't even eat more than one.  We then tried the artichoke/garlic dip with pita; it had a good texture & presentation but that's about it. It was cold, bland, and boring. Half the plate was cold pita triangles and nacho chips, you couldn't taste the garlic in the dip at all... I was even embarrassed at the appearance of my drink (some German Riesling, not very good) because the chips & fries were so greasy that all you could see was fingerprints all over my glass.   But I will admit, I believe it was two members of management or possibly the owners visited our tables to see how we were enjoying out meal. They we both so soothing and polite that I didn't have the heart to tell them I hated the food :("}
{"text":"Beautiful building perfectly placed along the river.  Food is good but a little overpriced.  Service is adequate.  Good drinks."}

{"text":"After hearing a lot about Burntwood Tavern, we decided to stop by here after our hike.  1.) Service was rude. The waiter did not even seem to care about us, and when I asked about specials (where I distinctly remember there was something written on the board), he states, \"there's no specials.\" He didn't really greet us and didn't even seem to care about what we were ordering...or well anything.   2.) We sat by the window and there was a dead fly. Gross.  3.) The food was okay. Was it worth the hype to go here? Meh. Not really. I got the tavern dip sandwich- wasn't the greatest, the meat was alright, the fries that came with it- just okay. He got the margarita flatbread- also just okay.  Would I go back? Eh. Not really. I mean, if you're looking for a nice atmosphere (it's quite pretty) with okay food and okay service...and lots of old people inside, then sure? But it's not my style, that's all."}
{"text":"Pretty interior decor and location can't make up for terrible service and mediocre food. Waiter never brought soup orders for two guests. I got my tomato bisque but it was the consistency of paste. Worst was the fact that the bread plates were dirty -- yes, unwashed -- along with the utensils. I can only hope a competent restaurateur buys the place. Plus no parking."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was blan (pork chop was dry, and steak didn't have a whole lot of flavor). When the crowd cleared there were 2 mice that kept running around in the back room. All in all it was just an over priced restaurant with okay food and a fancy environment."}
{"text":"Had reservation for 7:45 for a party of 9. We were seated around 8:15 at a table for 6. It was a little tight but the management sent some free apps as a sorry. It worked. All had a great time. Burntwood Tots are must! I would steer clear of the prime rib. More than 1 said it was tough. But the Burntwood burger is impressive and delicious."}
{"text":"Service from the hostess to the wait staff treated my Wife and I like we was royalty. Never had to ask for anything.  Waitress was attentive without being intrusive. The food was fantastic as well.  What a great way for Neto have my birthday dinner."}

{"text":"*When it's warm outside this location has the best patio to sit on. I love the food at burntwood tavern! The chicken sliders app is the best I have ever had. It's spicy but with a little homemade peppercorn ranch and a nice crispy juicy piece of chicken. I could eat them everyday. I've also had the tater tots which are quite delish- and come with an array of dipping sauces.  For dinner I ordered the asiago chicken and the crusted filet medallions to share with my mom. We like our filet cooked differently and they were willing to accommodate us and cook them at separate temperatures and split the entrees for us. Lastly, they offer the best miniature desserts in tiny glass mugs. Only a few dollars a piece they are impossible to resist. The apple cobbler one was the best! Topped with Mitchell's ice cream. My mom really liked the tiny mugs and we asked about purchasing one to take home. The server spoke to the manager and they also were able to quickly accommodate! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Normally a pretty nice experience at this location, but tonight I feel compelled to write a review.  We were looking forward to your Veteran's night offer of a free dinner for military personnel which is absolutely totally wonderful that you offer this...What we experienced has everything to do with our server Jennifer.  Talk about inattentive, uninterested and totally could cared less about our dining experience. Never a mention about military service, slow, never took our dishes, never asked if we wanted dessert, coffee, it goes on.. Sorry Burntwood you totally failed tonight."}
{"text":"Burntwood Tavern is very unique and located in a very convienent location.  We had a very large group and without a reservation, they sat us right away.  I should add, that it was busy, and the hostess did not even roll her eyes when we told her 12-15 ppl were in our party. The appetizers were fabulous - I had tuna nachos, but others had the quesadillas and they looked amazing!  Entrees did not meet the overall expectations and one person in our party had a chicken dish that was still raw.   The reason for the 4 stars is: 1. The service!  Seating 15 ppl who don't have a reservation on a busy night without an eye roll is tough!  Plus, since it was my friends birthday, the manager gave EVERYONE in our party a free glass of champagne to toast! 2. The appetizers!  They were delic! 3. The drink menu!  They had some very fun drinks and a wide variety!  I will be back - definitely not getting the chicken though!"}
{"text":"The firecracker shrimp was amazing in taste and came out promptly, however the portion could be bigger considering the price. My server was pleasant and funny but service was slow due to all of the big parties due to graduations etc. It may have been better if management helped the serving staff instead of standing around the hostess booth. There were four managers and only one was helping out clearing tables grabbing drinks and getting water. All in all it was ok, may try again on a slower night."}
{"text":"Tried Burntwood Tavern tonight for the first time... and the last. It was later when we arrived so we did not have to wait for a table. There was live music in the bar which was pretty good although the noise level in the whole place was very high since there are no separated areas.   A manager came buy to get our beer order and our waiter showed up shortly thereafter.  He was pleasant. That's where the experience took a turn for the worst.  We weren't very hungry so we decided to order and share a $10 angus burger with cheddar, medium well,  with fries and a bowl of chili. We mistakenly figured a $10 burger would be a good size for sharing.  The food came and nothing was right. My fries were cold. my husband's chili was cold, the burger was raw in the center and missing the cheese.  The hand cut fries were also soggy and greasy. They offered a free dessert but we didn't want dessert.   They had to redo everything. The chili was hot but tasted like a whole bottle of smoke flavor had been dumped into it. The burger was now burnt to a crisp and still missing the cheese.  The fries were hot but still soggy and greasy. Did I mention this $10 burger was the size of a Wendy's junior hamburger!   A total bust of a meal and setting. Save your money for anywhere else. An expensive tavern should be able to at least make a  decent cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and very nice staff.  We go to this location often and we always have had great service.  Sarah is our favorite but there are many good servers.  Managers are always nice and very personable.  Food is good, drinks are great.  Happy hour is amazing!   Its a great place to hang out with your family or friends in a casual atmosphere.  We have visited other locations, even in Naples, FL and Chagrin is by far our favorite.  It's a small space and a tad squeezed in but that's what makes it cozy.  When the patio is open it really opens up this location.   I would recommend and do recommend this location often!!"}
{"text":"I have had mixed reviews of Burtwood in the past. However, this location (for whatever reason) seems to shine brighter than some of the other locations in the Cleveland area.   The ambiance is great. What used to be a miserable room (from many failed restaurants prior to Burntwood) has been opened up and remodeled into an excellent bar area with an excellent patio. The decor is great!  The wait staff have been great. One of the bar tenders in the afternoon is a bit to chatty for me (can you not see me reading?), but other than that, a good staff.  The food is excellent. I have only had a few things I disliked (the tuna nachos are terrible). But there are some killer items on the menu. The best items include the flatbreads which change seasonally, the homemade tater tots, and the tavern dip.   Happy hour is killer with half price apps from 3-6."}
{"text":"Okay so let me preface this review first by saying that this restaurant is in a beautiful location overlooking the Cuyahoga River. The decor is stylish and very mod. The bar is really a work of art and never have I said that I would prefer to sit in the bar area prior to coming here. The restaurant itself is very spacious and offers indoor and outdoor seating.   I've visited this restaurant three times. The first two times was to take advantage of their excellent happy hour specials: half off select cocktails and half off appetizers. For those two visits, the food was good, the servers were attentive, and the experience was overall enjoyable.   This past Sunday, I was excited to meet my parents there for brunch. We have been scouting out a location to have my post-graduation from graduate school dinner. Unfortunately, my latest experience left a very bitter taste in my mouth. To start, the restaurant was not busy and we were seated quickly enough (there were four of us). The server only brought out two waters to started and return a few minutes later with the other two. He returned to take our order about five minutes after that. I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict and the others in my party ordered the prime rib Benedict, omelette of the day, and pumpkin pancakes. The food took about 40 minutes, yes 40 minutes, to reach our table. Keep in mind, the restaurant was not busy and the server never returned during our 40 minute wait to refill our waters. Meanwhile a young child a table over was screaming and making a racket nonstop. Never did anyone stop at our table to offer to move us to a quieter location.  Fast forward, the food finally arrived via food runners and I had to remind the food runners and later the server that we needed more water. Each meal had imperfections. My meal, which was supposed to be smoked salmon Benedict, was just baked salmon that was quite cold. The prime rib Benedict had eggs that were over-cooked (hard-boiled). The pumpkin pancakes which were supposed to have pecans, did not. The food runners also didn't bring any syrup with the pancakes. The omelette was pathetic, cold, and tiny. I felt so bad about the quality of the food that I was apologizing to my parents and guest for the quality and quantity of the food.   I don't know what's going on in the kitchen at Burntwood, but there is some serious room for improvement. I really liked this place, but my graduation dinner is special and I can't let the mistakes from this brunch be repeated on such a big night for me."}
{"text":"The atmosphere & food cannot hide the terrible service.   I live within walking distance, so I keep giving this place \"one more try\".  Today I brought a friend for brunch ( who had never been there). We arrived at 11:45, and sat in the bar, which was half empty.   You would Think that  with the amount of servers milling about, that the service would have good.   It took forever to get our drinks;  we had to ask if we could place our order. The girl at the bar was so distracted that it took forever to even get a glass of water. My order was wrong and half of it was cold.  I didn't even bother to try to correct it,  because it would have been dinner time before I would have received a fresh plate."}
{"text":"A cozy warm spot for a great meal. Stepping inside the Burntwood Tavern in Chagrin Falls is like stepping into a little piece of heaven. Roaring fireplace, the smell of (you guessed it) a wood-burning grill. I love their delicious smoked chicken quesadillas, & asiago-crusted chicken. My husband loves their cedar salmon, and people rave over their firecracker shrimp. I'm so glad I brought my folks to Burntwood for their amazing Sunday morning brunch! (I wouldn't mention it, except that it was mentioned by our guests on two different occasions: it can be difficult to hear one another over their piped-in music, for some reason (am i getting old!?)."}
{"text":"This used to be Mermma's aka Max & Erma's. The facade is kind of drab but the interior is SWANK! I went here for a high school reunion type thing and it was the perfect venue for all my Ivy League graduated Solon past classmates ;).   Some of us got appetizers and most of us just ordered drinks. So pricey! Service was slower because it was a weekend night and there were 20 of us. It's a very roomy and dimly lit space. I'd probably come back for a romantic date but definitely not for brunch or something casual."}
{"text":"I am surprised by many of the negative reviews.  I do agree that the service can be lacking at times, but I love this menu.  They have something for everyone.  My standby meal is the shrimp tacos and a chopped, house or wedge salad.  The salads are very good and the portion is large for a $5 side salad.  The veggie burger is good too, and we find the fish specials to be very good.  I think the food is consistently good.  The patio is always fun and busy in the warmer months. My only complaint would be the occasional lack of service."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but it ends there. The food is highly overpriced, lower quality ingredients, and hardly any flavor. The service is hit or miss most seem to not care about their tables and bare minimum is the service you will most likely receive. The drinks are very overpriced and even a simple mule was made incorrectly. It's definitely a chain that left a poor taste in my mouth and I will not return to any location. I've given the Solon tavern two attempts and both were very poor. If you're looking for a good meal and drinks I suggest to skip burnt wood and check out somewhere else"}
{"text":"Outstanding food!  Probably didn't expect the flow of people, Short staffed on Labor Day.  Our 1st time here & we understand WHY people come here!  I am GF & they even had a small menu for me!  Other bigger chains bring a notebook of Every item they serve & it's up to the 'customer' to go through it, page by page, to find something we can eat.  We HIGHLY recommend this restaurant for the menu, cleanliness & Friendly Staff!  Excellent service & originality on menu items will keep us coming back, a Lot!"}
{"text":"Stopped because of yelp and loved it! The pictures tell the story it did taste as good as it looks!"}
{"text":"Burntwood is always worth the splurge! Great happy hour options on both drinks and starters. The regular menu might have items at prices a bit higher than you can find elsewhere but the food is always good and worth the price you pay! The Moscow mules are worth the trip alone, but the atmosphere and occasional live music don't hurt either. Definitely join their rewards program, as it does add up and give you some nice perks!"}
{"text":"decent bloody mary, but could use an extra kick [especially if one is partial to spicy flavors]. fish & chips are standard, if not slightly bland. pumpkin ravioli is expertly spiced, and very tasty."}
{"text":"The food is usually pretty good. (My zucchini frites were a little bland and messy), drinks are good and prices are decent. We like their happy hour. The atmosphere is really cozy at all the locations which make it a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Lunch here today. Was nice out so sat outside. Great service, good food. Had the Blackened Shrimp tacos. Decent option for watching carb intake. Also had the wedge salad with ranch dressing. Always one of my favorite salads. My wife and I ate at the location in Cuyahoga Falls a few months ago and loved it, so when I saw this place, I had to stop. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Took my sweetheart to Cuyahoga Falls for the day for Valentines Day. No definite plans during the day so freelanced at some shops. Stopped here for lunch as I had already scoped it out  before coming here. What a great choice. We had a table overlooking the river. My wife loved the view. Our server was pleasant and helpful. We both chose a burger. My wife got the angus burger on a lettuce bed. Had good flavor and was cooked to order. I had the Burntwood burger. What a treat. It had hashbrown, fried egg, bacon, tomato and awesome bread butter pickles. What a large tasty sandwich. Both came with fresh cut fries which were very good. We finished off lunch with a mini mug desert. Perfect ending. I would definitely recommend this coming here and we will be back ourselves."}
{"text":"This is a place I never really keep on my radar but I don't really know why. I end up here before or after nail appointments often and am always pleasantly surprised.   It may be unassuming and feel a bit chain-like, but the quality and consistency are there. You can't beat $4 wine and half off appetizers during happy hour EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. The spicy chicken sliders do not disappoint, especially for $5!   The lighting inside is always cozy and pleasant after a work day (screw those places with crazy bright lights!!!!) and the service is always prompt and friendly.   Go between 3-6 to catch the awesome happy hour!"}
{"text":"Visited a few weeks ago on a quiet Sunday night...first impression wasn't very good. We only came here for appetizer and drinks - both were not great. We had the spinach artichoke dip - it only came with a few tortilla chips and naan bread slices on a board with the dip, had to ask for more - why not just give a basket of chips? I've made better dip at home, it had whole pieces of garlic (lazy food prep?) in it, very little flavor or artichokes and wasn't very cheesy.  Tried a glass of sangria - seemed like there was soda water in it or something, not good. First glass of water had something in it, had to ask for another glass - poor service, must check glasses before sending out to table!!!  Positives: Location, waiter was nice despite glass issue, the interior is very cozy, especially the bar area where we sat.  If I come back, I'm sticking to salad or sandwich and glass of wine or beer."}
{"text":"I need to be 100% honest with you: I don't love Burntwood.  It's part of a restaurant group with mixed reviews on their food and service.  However, even if I don't love it, I can respect it.  The Solon location is constantly slammed and is a beautiful building with a huge patio.  The food is upscale American fare with sandwiches, salads, entrees, and some specials.  The beer list is long, but not overly diverse, and I think this is the first place I ever paid $8 a pint for an IPA.  The food is fine, but it's not really trying to be great.  It's a lot like the Rusty Bucket in that regard.  Despite that, visiting with lowered expectations actually provides a better experience.  The staff was courteous and helpful, and has been on every visit."}
{"text":"We were there on a Friday night and the bar was very crowded. We were surprised that there isn't more consistency among these taverns - for example, the tavern in Brecksville has great calamari but in Chagrin it was overcooked and the Sicilian flatbread pizza was great in Chagrin but terrible in Brecksville. Also the fish in Rocky River is better than in Brecksville. Shouldn't they figure out how to build their reputation by increasing consistency?"}
{"text":"Hello - they took the Greek flatbread pizza OFF the menu. I've tried the Southwest flatbread pizza - but it doesn't compare to the one they took off the menu. And we found that the 'chefs' on call for the weekend don't seem to compare to those that work during the week. We have found the food much better during the week - what's up with consistency????"}
{"text":"For starters, the Calamari was amazing. After eating the Calamari, I was thinking the steaks would probably taste as good as the Calamari. After getting the meal looking at my food it looked pretty good. Then I took a bite the steak was tough and very chewy. Also the steak left a weird after taste. The fried were okay. For sure not the best, left a weird after taste that tasted like play-doe. Overall, the food was okay, reminded me of Apple-Bees."}
{"text":"This place lived up to its incredible reputation. I have been hearing about its warm atmosphere and fantastic food for a while now and finally had a chance to check it out for myself.  Our group of 7 made reservations in advance to assure ourselves a seat. When we arrived, the place was buzzing and the hostess said that our table wasn't ready. We went into the bar area to kill time and get a drink.  Now, the bar ambiance alone deserves 5 stars. It has a tall ceiling with large windows that look out over the river for a pleasant view. There were some tables available inside and on the small patio on the far side of the bar but the counter itself was huge. The bar staff was animated and attentive, making drinks for the entire restaurant quickly but with the same care as if they were only serving the bar area. The drinks were strong and well made, I had a Rum and Coke that was only $4. Definitely worth it for the value you are receiving. The servers picking up the drinks added their own garnishes for maximum freshness of the drinks. After a bit of a wait, our table was finally ready. In that time, our party grew from 7 to 9 but the hostess and waitress were more than happy to accommodate us. Now, for the food. Since we had a large group we ordered 3 appetizers to share among us.  The calamari tasted like it was just caught on the coast that was fried with a slightly spicy batter that gave it just a little kick.  The hummus platter was more than enough for a few people. The hummus is smooth and tasty but the real hero is the pita. Obviously well made, it tasted as if it just came out of the oven. I shared a bowl of the lobster bisque with my companion (and by companion I mean my mother) that we both thoroughly enjoyed. It was creamy and thick but not heavy. For my meal I ordered the Chicken Avocado Flatbread and my mom ordered the Asiago Chicken Sandwich. I figured since the place was on the fancier side that the portions for the meals would shrink. I was completely wrong. My flatbread, what I expected to be a little square about the size of my hand, turned out to be a full on medium size thin crust pizza. I was over the moon. Even though I don't like tomatoes, I found myself changing my tune as I dug into the meal. Every ingredient worked together to create an incredible eating experience.  My mother enjoyed her sandwich just as I did. She was unable to finish and brought it home. I finished it the next day for lunch and I have to say that it was probably the best chicken dish I've ever eaten. I will definitely be returning!  In summary: Food - 5; Staff - 4; Ambiance - 4"}
{"text":"The service was soooo slow i ordered brunch and like 25 minutes later still havent got it and also there was no one at the hostess stand"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and had the Sicilian Flatbread with Tots at the bar. Nice place to relax and enjoy a good meal. Looks like the outside seating would be nice during warmer weather."}
{"text":"First time here & most likely our last.  We were seated pretty quickly as it wasn't real crowded for a Friday night.  Waitress came over after about 5 minutes, took our drink order.  Once we got our drink orders she asked if we wanted to order an appetizer so we ordered the Tavern Tots, 30 minutes later we got our appetizer.  Waitress still hadn't asked us what we wanted for dinner.  About 10 minutes after we finished our appetizer the waitress came back and took our plates and said she would be back with drink refills.  Again still never taking our dinner order.  Another 10 minutes go by and she came back without drinks asking us what else we wanted, we told her the check.  I wasn't going to wait another hour for our food."}
{"text":"A great place to go in the summer for an intimate setting with a small group. Share their pub chips with a side of their sauce! I love the atmosphere on their patio with twinkle lights and live music."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Burntwood Tavern. The restaurant is very nice on the inside. The food was ok, a little greasy on the burger. (Burntwood Burger). The \"pour mule\" was not so great. The first one was watered down, and the second one was the extreme opposite, being too strong. Either way, it was a normal eating experience from the food to the drinks. Not worth the price at all. The major drawback is the staff. I have never seen such an unprofessional group. It appears they have the same recruitment process that Abercrombie and Fitch have - if you have the looks, you're hired, ability is last on the list of criteria. The hostesses kept flirting with the waiters, checking them out, being extremely obvious and doing absolutely no work at all. The waiters would hide by the drink station and discuss the hostesses in a non professional way. It was like a social hour for the staff. There appeared to be no manager at all as there was no discipline or professionalism from anyone that was within my view for the evening. There were, at all times, 5-6 staff members gathered at the hostess station just chatting away. I would never go back to this particular location, however, I may try other locations. If the staff was professional, and were there to work, as opposed to being there for paid social night, the food and drinks may have been better, and the experience may have held up to expectation of any decent, pricey restaurant."}
{"text":"service is good and friendly.  the tater tots are delicious, but, could have been warmer.  I got the club sandwich and for a dinner portion, it was pretty small.  they have good coffee though."}
{"text":"Surprised by the mediocre reviews. I have been here a few times and everything I've tried was delicious. Great appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and burgers, and great Bloody Mary bar and brunch on the weekends!"}
{"text":"They have the best happy hour in Cleveland.  The food is delicious and the drinks are refreshing.  It's pricey when it's not happy hour, but otherwise it's a great value!"}
{"text":"Great food and service here @ the Old Spanish Tavern location. My grandma loved it! The HH was an amazing deal. So amazing that we actually ate nothing but appetizers for our Christmas Eve dinner. Some of the appetizers were hit or miss, but all edible. The ambiance is modern yet quaint. I am happy it still resembles the old Spanish Tavern, and so is G'ma. Also- a wonderful fireplace. I will return when I am home again. I am sure G'ma will insist on it!"}
{"text":"My most recent trip to this Burntwood location was not the best I've had. I went on Sunday for brunch and though not terribly busy, it took quite a long time to be greeted by the bartender (I was sitting at the bar). But the truly disappointing thing was the meal I ordered. From the brunch menu I chose the BLT with Egg. BLTs are pretty tough to screw up. This chef certainly found a way. Rather than a BLT with egg, I got a grilled cheese with BLT ingredients. The bread was over buttered and soggy, there were two slices of square American cheese (not in the description - I double checked), some bacon, pink tomatoes and shredded lettuce. The egg was fine, but not enough to redeem the rest of the plate!  The potatoes were cold, and the fruit looked like it was scooped from a bag of frozen smoothie ingredients. What?"}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary Bar is awesome! It's the best one that I've seen. To start off you get a choice of vodkas some of which are house infused such as bacon and pepper. There are then three  Bloody mixes you can add yourself. Normally I am not a fan of the boring celery stalk that gets stuck in my drink. Burntwood's extras really raise the bar. There are your typical things like pickles and bacon, but I mostly enjoyed the smoked shrimp, cheese and smoked meat cubes. There were a bunch of hot sauce options too.   As for food, a brunch menu is available on both Saturday and Sunday. I kept it simple with Blueberry Pancakes. They had berries on top and well distributed throughout. Three came in an order and they were large. I got a side of bacon which was really good - not too fatty, a little greasy and a little crunchy.   This is the first time I have been to this building since it was a Champs. Burntwood really did a great job on the space. It's a really cozy environment, nice patio and cool interior lighting."}
{"text":"We had a really nice time at Burntwood Tavern. We sat on the patio, which is nicely secluded and over looks water, so it is very relaxing out there. I would have given five stars, but our service was painfully slow, however, it didn't bother me much since it was nice to just hang out on the patio.   I thought thought the tuna nachos were awesome. Their fried wonton chips really made the dish for me. As an entree I went with the Asiago chicken, which was incredibly good. I never have high hopes for chicken in restaurants, it's usually dry and not worth the cost. I'm honestly not sure why I even ordered it, but I am so happy I did. It was perfection. My boyfriend got the tacos, and we also sampled one of the flat bread pizzas. All of the food exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"Joined some friends for dinner at Burntwood Tavern and was disappointed. The presentation of my plate was horrible. I ordered the chicken Madeira. The sauce and cheese where on the plate as it had run completely off the chicken breast and looked like it had been microwaved. The dish is $18 and it was not very good. With J Alexander next door and all the choices in the area, I was surprised that the food was not delicious. The food was really slow coming out too. We had gotten to the point where the server came pass the table at least four times with no food in site. Our dinner ended with the server screwing up the bills. My friend will now have to call the restaurant for a refund as she was charged for her bill and another guest bill. I was charged for another guest bill but my bill was corrected before I left. So you figure the food is nothing to write home about, they are slow, and our bills were screwed up. No real reason to go back."}
{"text":"Great food and very accommodating for our party of 11 - with 2 kids. Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"My last night in town. I was tired and didn't want to think about dinner but I wanted something good.  This hit the spot.  I was surprised really. I sat at the bar.   The filet was sooooooooo good. Cooked perfect.   The potatoes were amazing.  I ate it all. I'll be back if I'm in town again....."}
{"text":"Beautiful location, trash quality food.  $30 for a burnt ribeye, i see why its called \"Burntwood Tavern\"."}
{"text":"I only give this one star because it makes you give a star.  Décor of the restaurant and overall feel is great. Service... That's another story. It was by leaps and bounds one of my worst experiences I've ever had.  Man I hate to say that but it ruined the entire experience for us.  We ordered from the bar, a glass of wine, an app and an entrée. Out of all of those items, the entrée arrived first, even before our wine. By the time we received silverware and A napkin, our meals were cold. An all around disappointment."}
{"text":"Wow. An unfortunate evening. Sat outside  at 4:30 pm. Service awfully slow. Appetizer came before drinks. (20 minutes). I asked the waitperson if he knew about our drinks. He said \"I have no idea\" and walked away. Waited and waited some more. No food. We decided to leave and I asked to speak to the manager. I was told (after 10 minutes) that the manager was \"on the line in the kitchen .\" Very disappointed. Won't be back. It was a special night and it worked out awfully."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner and drinks here last night. The happy hour prices are impressive, but I certainly didn't feel like I was eating frozen, microwaved bar snacks. I ordered the shrimp tacos and a side of tater tots (not your typical tots--and that's a good thing). Both were delicious. I also had the VIP martini; the blue cheese olives were a much appreciated touch. Before tip, my meal was 17.00, and I think that's a really great deal based on the quality of everything ordered. My friend had a flatbread that looked excellent; this was also half-price during the happy hour. I hope to return because there were so many menu items, particularly the appetizers and sandwiches, that sounded interesting.   I was less impressed with the items on the entree menu; these offerings seemed less inspired and somewhat expensive for what they were. Obviously, I can't comment on how they taste. My impulse is that for $20-25 dollars, there are better places to have an entree.   Service was somewhat slow, which only bothered me because we wanted to make sure we ordered while the happy hour was ongoing. By the same token, it was nice not to feel rushed because I was with friends I hadn't seen in a while. Over-all, I would definitely recommend this spot. It's nice to see a local chain take over the empty Max and Erma's building. It's certainly an upgrade and a nice new addition to the Montrose area."}
{"text":"So good!  We had amazing service from start to finish. We had a large group with children. The gentleman that sat us, our server, everyone was so nice. The decor and everything was so cozy and unique. We had the old river burger. So good!!!!!  Kids eat free on Mondays. It's very hard to come by decent service and food these days for some reason. Rarely do you find both in the same place. Especially when you're out with kids. This place surpasses all standards. I can't say enough good things about it."}
{"text":"After going to the Burntwood Tavern in Brecksville a few times after the first review was written. I think the odd service is isolated to the Rocky River location.  The Brecksville staff is pretty accommodating, I just wish they weren't slow at times."}
{"text":"Absolutely like the atmosphere and the cedar salmon is to die for! My parent came from out of town and I made sure I took them to Burntwood before they left. Everyone loved their meals.   My one complaint is the Mother's Day buffet style setup. It was never fully stocked and the food was below the normal high quality standard. Will not be going back on Mother's Day."}
{"text":"Nice drinks and atmosphere. Food is so so. Apps are good- but a lot of fried items on the menu. And entrees are overpriced. We fine dine a few times a month. Mediocre."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER THE ASIAGO CRUSTED CHICKEN   I absolutely LOVE the ambiance of this Fairlawn location and I LOVE that you can call and make reservations so for me these are 5 stars on the rating scale. My first visit I set up a lunch with all my Aunts and Cousins and It was nice because we could all talk and it wasn't really loud and noisey. I ordered the Steak salad and I enjoyed it although for the price I felt there could have been more steak on it. My Aunt ordered the Asiago Chicken and this is the reason I am writing this review....the chicken came out a double breast of chicken pounded so flat that it seriously was about 1/8\" thick. It was heavily breaded and appeared to have been pan fried. It was blackened on one side and the whole piece of meat was tough and chewy/hard. It looked disgusting and my Aunt said that it was. I was embarrassed that I had recommended we all meet there for lunch. The rest of the table seemed to like their lunches although some thought it was a bit pricey for sandwiches.  A second Aunt had the fish sandwich and it was HUGE and she really liked it.  About 2 weeks later I set up an evening dinner date with another couple and the 4 of us had a reservation. They promptly sat us at a booth (which I requested) and we enjoyed the berry mules while the husbands had a beer. We ordered the firecracker shrimp and also got the hummus appetizer and both were fine. My friends husband ordered the Fish and chips dinner and he loved it.  My friend ordered the ASIAGO CRUSTED CHICKEN, I cringed and thought maybe I should say something? Then I thought I'm sure my Aunts chicken was just a one time problem and I let my friend order the chicken without speaking up. It came out worse than my Aunts. It was pounded so flat that the chicken covered the entire plate. It was seriously paper thin again heavily breaded and fried. It was greasy, hard and disgusting. You could have picked it up and threw it like a frisbee. My friend could not eat it. One of the managers came by and asked how our meals were after we were all done and luckily her husband spoke up and said this chicken was horrible! The manager agreed that they have issues with this particular dish and that people complain often about it. PLEASE FIX IT THEN! The manager was very kind and gave my friend a gift card because they had already cashed out our bill.  My husband ordered a big burger with an egg on it and he liked his burger and I ordered the filet mignon and both of us enjoyed our meals. Like I said before I really enjoy this restaurant and I love the ambiance. We will be back but I wanted to warn you about the ASIAGO Crusted breaded chicken."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with our visit to Burntwood Tavern tonight. We are usually not ones to complain, however was not happy with the quality of meal tonight. Ordered my go to asiago crusted chicken sandwich- with aioli and arugula on a sandwich type roll. I received the crusted chicken on a pretzel roll with shredded lettuce and a tomato. We asked the waiter if the sandwich was changed because it was clearly not what I have ever gotten 10+ times before. He wasn't sure since we was fairly new. We were going to ask a manager on the way out but no one was to be found, not even a hostess at the stand. We didn't want to complain but just know if there were changes, if so it would not be something I would order again. The menu didn't show any changes in the sandwich, but if you looked at the menu online the asiago crusted chicken sandwich description was changed to and included Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, and bacon. ( the sandwich I got didn't even have bacon on it). I'm not sure why the sandwich differs so much from the entree. I'm sure we will still be back to Burntwood tavern but will have to find a new favorite menu item and may not be our go to restaurant for date night. ...Disappointed."}
{"text":"We went in for happy and ordered the avocado chicken flatbread and the quesadillas. We love a good happy hour but we're disappointed by the food. The chicken was the same on both the pizza and in the quesadilla (kind of tasted like it was from a can).   On the up side we loved the atmosphere and our waitress was great."}
{"text":"We've been numerous times to the Solon restaurant. The food is pretty standard for the type of restaurant but they have some unique twists that make it stand out here. I've only had one \"flaw\" with my food and it was promptly taken care of, and even once when my daughter didn't like what she ordered, they quickly replaced it with another item and didn't charge for the first. I was impressed. My favorite item is the artichoke and tasso fondue. The Asian Chicken Salad was another favorite though it's been taken off the menu, you can still get it if you ask. I've not been a fan of any of the specialty drinks I've ordered at happy hour. They just didn't appeal to me. the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant has always been clean and well ordered. The patio area is fantastic on those perfect days when the weather cooperates."}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere! This place has such great character. Definitely going to have to come back."}
{"text":"Got seated early to meet my party on a Friday night. (Reservations suggested.) Nice Happy Hour food selections that taste so good. Bottled beer is $3. Wine is $4.  Not part of the HH, but I would like see more craft beers on the menu. Tonight's specials were fish oriented. Good service. Nice that the manager talks with the customers, and helps out."}
{"text":"Good spot for a nite cap and food. Large very nice oval bar. Large dining room. Best shrimp tacos. In good weather panels are opened to the outside."}
{"text":"One word awful! We went on a Wednesday night! Not that busy! The service was so bad! We had three different people serving us! I order the cedar plank salmon! It was the worst thing I have ever ate! DRIED UP I almost choked! This place is such a rip off save your money!"}
{"text":"The Solon location of Burtwood Tavern at moments has an appeal of a place with character and eclectic eats. Yet, each of the past 3 times I dined there left me longing for another venue.  It's not that it is terrible, but the service is at best a 3 star, the menu sounds amazing but what ends up on the table is uneventful.  The Chagrin Falls/South Russell location of Burntwood seems to have better staff, but the same gap between menu and taste.  The engaging food and switched-on servers in Solon are just around the corner at Rusty Bucket or Harvest.  And of course, Swirl Wine Bar for wine or a night cap."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I mean, there really is no other way to explain the experience we had here except that phrase. But don't worry, I won't say that and then not tell you why.   First, when you go in to this place it looks like a haven of good food, great service and a cozy atmosphere. This is deceiving! What you get food wise is so below the standard that the setting implies that it's almost obscene.   Me, my father and my grandfather all went here after grocery shopping. We saw it on Yelp and it seemed like it had good reviews, and we're always looking for someplace new around Chagrin Falls. We were actually very excited to go!  In the begining, service was great. She was attentive, she answered questions, she was friendly. I ordered their artichoke dip from the appetizer list and from the description it says it is a heated (as in, not cold like hummus) dip that comes with pita and whatnot. When it came (seventeen minutes after being ordered, and two minutes before all the entrees arrived) it was cold, stone cold. The only thing that was mildly warm was the ramekin. I sent it back, asking that they reheat it. The waitress looked at me as if she didn't understand my request before nodding and taking it away. The entrees came before the appetizer came back. I should have said to take it away, and not bother, but I try not to do that in front of grandpa (it makes him upset).   Both my father and I ordered fish sandwiches, and he had asked for no bun. They gave him the bun anyways. He took it off and when the top piece of bread came off ALL of the coating on the top of the fish peeled away with it. Leaving a slimy, par-cooked looking mess in front of him. It was awful. I lifted the bun off mine to see if it did the same thing, and it did. Very gross.   We nibbled on fries because at this point my father wanted to send his sandwich back, I didn't have the appetizer, and we were desperately hungry. 3/4 of the fries in the little wrapper they give you were overcooked to the point of being dark brown.  When the waitress came back with the appetizer my father told her about the sandwich and she had the gall to say 'that's how it comes out'. Really? It comes out with the skin peeling off it and a cold, slimy center? Perhaps this is true. Perhaps that is normal. But dang, that's disgusting.   It also didn't help that she was snippy for the rest of our interactions, and she proceeded to ignore us for the rest of the dinner. (I nibbled on the dip and ignored my sandwich, my father had it sent back never to return).   Sadly, we left a bare minimum tip. We would have left nothing, but my grandpa is too much of a gentleman--even to people who don't deserve it."}
{"text":"Burntwood used to be really good, but I think they've gone downhill in the last couple years.  We made reservations for our group and were quickly seated upon arrival. Everyone was friendly and the service was pretty good.  The meal was kind-of like the name of that old movie, 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.'  The good- I had a side salad that was pretty tasty, although it was a little overdressed. I can overlook the slight soppiness because the flavors were decent. Lobster bisque- Also good, no complaints, it was a decent bowl of soup.  The bad- My husband got a burger of which I took a bite. To me, it tasted dry and bland, but I didn't say anything. When we left, I asked how he liked his burger. His exact response: \"It sucked. I'd never go back.\"  The Ugly- I ordered a margherita flatbread. It arrived and, I kid you not, there were *maybe* two pieces of basil torn into 4 pieces, a smattering of mozzarella cheese, and the most anemic looking tomatoes ever to see the light of day. It was dry as all get-out and the flatbread itself was like cardboard. In fact, I believe cardboard would have tasted better. The whole thing was bland. The cheese didn't even have any flavor. It's cheese! I mean, how do you have cheese with no flavor?!?!?!? My husband tried it and said, 'This is horrible. How do you even serve this to people?'   **In the other reviews I saw someone posted a picture of a really good looking margherita pizza. This made me really angry, food angry (and who likes to be angry about food?) because mine looked NOTHING like the tasty one in that picture. Mine looks like it came from hell's kitchen. And I don't mean the show. If you're going to put something on your menu, there needs to be consistency from one plate to another."}
{"text":"Burntwood is a staple, and absolutely one of our Go-To places in the area.  I tend to eat here more frequently during the Fall and Winter months, because the wooden interior and fireplace just make it seem that much more homey and appropriate for the colder months.  Their Happy Hour is (not going to lie) a big driving force for coming here.  Many items half off, like their absolutely delicious flatbreads, which include many different varieties for all your taste bud desires.  Their prime rib chili is absolutely amazing - and hits the spot, every spot, you can imagine.  Their specialty/signature cocktails are also on special, and these things are JUST that - special!  Unique and bold flavors which accent a very fun cocktail menu, much different than your typical Happy Hour specials and suggestions.  The ambiance is comforting, soothing, semi-fancy, so very suitable for any moment, be it a celebration or a company get together.  I highly recommend Burntwood and find them to be a refreshing taste in the Solon area!"}
{"text":"Unfortunate that this restaurant has gone down hill.  Flatbread limp, steak salad had 3 tomato cubes, 2 pecans, about 4 egg piece crumbs, and 7 1/2 in. Pieces of steak for $14.  Fries were cold and unseasoned and limp with grease.  Staff inattentive and don't even bother to ask if your meal was good.  Taking this restaurant off our list of good places to visit.  We have lost faith in what used to be a high quality, high taste experience."}
{"text":"We have always gone to the Chagrin Falls location and we were happy that one opened closer. We got the friendliest greeting upon entering the restaurant. We were seated and lucky to get a table with Chris as our server. We ordered several appetizers. We ordered what we usually order at Burntwood. Chris was very helpful with advise. He was friendly and we received great service."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here with two of our friends for her 30th birthday dinner in which we both ordered steaks and drinks. The wine was the house red I ordered which was good and the steaks came out perfectly cooked. They have a $12 mimosa special (all you can drink apparently) on Saturdays as well as a build-your-own bloody mary bar. I thought their food was wonderful and the ambiance was great. Being from Columbus, Mentor's version of what's \"Good\" or \"Excellent\" is way off base. Half the places I go to that are rated that suck. This place held up to the larger city quality. I'll gladly come here again and my sister and I got our parents a gift certificate here for the holidays. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the mediocre reviews.  I was actually pleasantly surprised when I went to Burntwood .    They have a wide selection of beers, although our waitress wasn't as well versed in them as I would have liked to have seen.  For our meal, we ordered the hummus tray which had a nice selection of pitas (including a cheese crusted which went over very well) and vegetables.  I was happy with the taste and sometimes I can be a bit over picky with my hummus options.  I had the Salmon option.  The salmon was done perfectly and complimented nicely with the sauce and sides.  Overall a pretty healthy option.  Others at the table were happy with their meals.  The burger was rated \"A+\" by my fiance and though he was originally a little disappointed with the size, it turned out to be \"just right\" so he left full but not too full.    Good atmosphere.  Good side room for parties.  Overall I really liked it and I think it's the perfect date spot (make note - Clevelanders!) because it's got a lot of universal appeal."}
{"text":"We had lunch there a couple weeks ago.  The atmosphere was nice, casual but nice.  I had the fish and chips, the fish was cooked in old burnt oil, the fries were cold and the coleslaw was the most disgusting thing I have tasted in a while.  The fish sandwiches were huge, but again were cooked in old oil.  The service was adequate  ."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  How do you screw up a BBQ chicken salad?  Old avocado, barely any dressing and no beans!    Waitress was flighty and rude, and my wine had a fruit fly in it.  99.9% sure they just dumped the little guy out, topped my wine off with the house.    My guest had a tuna sashimi salad.  Nothing to write home about, and clearly they have a shortage on dressing.  My first experience was so great that this was really disappointing."}
{"text":"You're paying for the atmosphere, not the food. I was itching to try this place but never had the time until now. The building itself looks very nice, inside and out. One would think that this might also be indicative of their food.  Unfortunately, the building itself is where the amazing impression ends. Looking through the menu, you're immediately faced with a very lack luster range of choices. The menu is dominated by burgers and sandwiches. The features (non-burger/sandwich options) aren't that great either. You might expect more grilled meats/seafood but there were only a few options.  As for the food I ordered, I had the grouper. It was decent tasting but not well portioned.  This restaurant suffers from a distinct break from its name. Burntwood Tavern alludes to an offering of great grill classics like steaks, grilled fish, etc. but the menu speaks a different story.  The service was also average."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of having some cocktails here this weekend.  It was a really neat spot with great decor!  The bar area had an old rustic trolley crane above the copper bar and huge mason jars full of liquor and goodies for infusing.  The drink menu had their twist on a Moscow Mule which was a pomegranate one or acai berry one.  I tried the pomegranate one, while delicious, a little too sweet for me.  For my second beverage, I went with a regular Moscow Mule.  It was delish!  Perfect lime, vodka, ginger beer ratio!  The lovely lady bartenders were very nice and attentive.  I didn't get a chance to look at their food menu.  I did see they have a Bloody Mary bar on Sunday's.  You choose what kind of vodka bacon, jalapeño, or regular and they make it table side for you with whatever you fancy in your Bloody Mary. Sounds good to me!  Will Definitely be back on a Sunday to check that out!"}
{"text":"Food was okay - service was HORRIBLE!  I don't normally give bad reviews but I do not want anyone to go through what we did. On a Sunday afternoon with a full house we waited 10 minutes for our server to approach us after being seated.   We ordered two appetizers, the calamari and the spinach and artichoke. The calamari had more garlic than calamari and the chips on the spinach and artichoke were so greasy they were visibly wet.   All of our dishes from the appetizers were stacked in the middle of our table - no one removed them and they remained as our centerpiece until we left.  Everyone at our table of 3  was without drinks for at least 10 minutes and during that time we NEVER saw our server. Our meals were delivered and we asked for refills from a passerby server.    The margarita flatbread was absolutely delish and has saved this review from being a 1 star. The other dishes ordered were mediocre at best. I used to be in the business and am extremely forgiving - when I asked if they were understaffed she said 'no - just the opposite, we have too many and are just falling all over each other'. The reason they are falling all over each other is because they are not attending to their guests!!  I saw a manager and he just seemed to fawn over all the beautiful servers and not care that guests weren't being attended to.   We were never asked how our food was and I had to flag her down when she was talking to another server to Ask for the check."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat in Cuyahoga Falls! If we are ever undecided where to eat, we know that Burntwood never disappoints. Their happy hour is the best around, with half price appetizers and flatbreads. We've tried almost everything on the menu, but our favorites are the shrimp tacos, avocado chicken flatbread, and burntwood burger. This place is great for any occasion! Bonus tip: ask for the pretzel bread (complimentary but off the menu)!"}
{"text":"This place has potential and I've enjoyed some meals thus far, but certain dishes are lacking in quality.  Cocktails need to be a bit more generous. However, the staff is very kind and helpful!"}
{"text":"I stopped in today to have lunch with a friend and I must say it's a pretty cool place. I give them an 'A' for atmosphere. The interior is very lavish and the views are incredible. I recommend sitting out on the patio if it's a nice day out. Make sure they seat you at a table with an umbrella, I noticed some tables (near the bar) didn't have an umbrella and the people sitting out there looked uncomfortable.  This would definitely be a cool place to check out for happy hour. They have a pretty big bar, two outdoor gas fireplaces, and comfortable outdoor seats.   As for the food, I wasn't very impressed. My friend and I both ordered the Burntwood Burger because it sounded pretty creative (egg, bacon, hash brown, etc.) but it was rather bland. I had a similar burger at Red Robin and it tasted way better. I guess my question is, if it's your signature burger why does it lack the 'wow' factor? Also, the fries they served were tiny (not skinny). They weren't even the whole fry, it's like they served me the ends of every fry. Plus they were all overcooked which gave them a burnt look to them. As we were eating I noticed the table next to us ordered fish and it looked delicious. I give my meal a 'C'. I was expecting something unique for the price.  The service was great. I noticed that some of the reviewers on here were bashing the servers but we were seated immediately, drinks and the food came out quick, plenty of refills. I noticed the servers were running around like crazy because the place was pretty packed, it can't be an easy job. Props to them.  Overall- great location, nice views, good service, okay food. I'll probably come back here for drinks or maybe to try a different dish. It's not on my 'A' list of restaurants but it got potential."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night after a long day at work. We wanted a mini celebration. When we walked in there were a lot of people waiting by the hostess station.There really isn't a great place to wait for a table in here. They told us 20 minutes and we were seated in about 5, that was a nice surprise. Once we were seated, all I really noticed is how loud it was! I understand this is a bar and not a quiet restaurant, but it was loud. Throughout the meal our waitress was attentive and helpful.  The food - the good: Cedar Salmon Salad - I wanted something light, was craving a salad. The salmon was well seasoned and well cooked. The salad was spinach which tasted pretty fresh with feta, onion, and a vinaigrette. It was dressed nicely, not too much, not too little. The crispy shoestring carrots on the salad were a very nice little surprise! The food - the bad: Pan Crusted Tilapia - 1st, the green beans came with bacon on them and bacon was listed nowhere in the description. We do not eat pork, so this was a problem. 2nd,  the whole thing had so much oil on it, it was hard to taste anything else. The oil didn't really even taste like anything either, just gave a bad mouth feel. Ick. Last, the fish itself was pan fried and besides being oily tasted really sweet. I felt that it was missing something, maybe salt or spice or something to go with the maple flavor. However, there was no salt at the table to try out my theory that salt would make it better. He ended up only eating about half of the dish and went home hungry. Not so great. If I was basing the rating on this dish, it would be a 1 star. But since the service was good and my dish was good, they are getting 2."}
{"text":"My husband and I made reservations tonight and we were looking forward to it.  It was our first time here, but had been to Le Fevers and Samir many times.  What a huge disappointment!  If you like chain restaurant food you will love this place.  I miss the classy decor and service  previously at Le Fevers and Samir.  It used to be quiet, classy, and cozy but now it's loud and the service is non existent.   Our food was less than mediocre.  I ordered lobster ravioli.  The dough was tough and it had a not so fresh taste........fishy.  My husband ordered the filet, said his potatoes were bland, nothing special, steak was good though.  I remember the way the chef served the potatoes at La Fevers and it made me sad.    Very little imagination went into our meals.  We had also both ordered wedge salads for starters.  Most high end places offer cracked pepper, which we both love but not here, never saw our server until she brought the check.  Also, doors were left open to the patio.  Flies were landing on our tables all night.  In addition I lifted up the place mat ( that covered the top of the table with a black table cloth underneath) and it was disgusting, layers of crumbs and food.  How do you clean the table top when it's a surface that cannot be cleaned? We won't be back, could get equivalent food with much better service at Applebee's."}
{"text":"Gorgeous decor.  So relaxing to be here.  Great staff.   Good beers.  Many are seasonal, so the menu is not too helpful.   Lots of parking."}
{"text":"My sister and I went for lunch at Burntwood Tavern when I was visiting my parents in my hometown at the trendy Crocker Park area of Westkake, Ohio -a Cleveland suburb.   It was both our first times there.  I enjoyed their delicious Salmon Salad with a generous portion of salmon filet and my sister loved the Harvest Chicken salad (pics) which included Gorgonzola cheese and dried pecans.   It was a pleasant dining experience UNTIL I was walking back to our table from the ladies room into the main dining area and slipped HARD on the ridiculously slippery floor, pulling my hip at the socket rather roughly and almost falling. Thankfully there was a booth next to me were I grabbed onto the wood frame while my pulse rate went sky high and my heart raced.   I was so agitated and spoke out loud about it when I returned to the table where my sister was seated and a lady two tables over said she also slipped and was terribly frightened.   The waitress was attending another table and responded that that she was sorry and would mention it to her manager.   Shortly afterwards the waitress returned to pick up our plates and stated that she mentioned my slip to her manager and that the manager is \"sending another email to the corporate to see what they can do about the slippery floor\".  I was surprised to hear this response and learn it was a continual problem.    Much to my shock the Manager, Monique, did in fact come over and clearly stated that she hears 5 to 7 complaints PER DAY about the slippery floors and that they have had the cleaning crew try to wash off the film, they've had it looked at by others, and they have sent numerous email complaints to corporate about the floors but nothing has been resolved since the restaurant opened a couple years ago.   I shockingly said to the Monique, \"What in the world are they waiting for?..  someone to slip and fall and cracked their head open and the restaurant to get sued in order to resolve this deathtrap?\" Her response was \"I know. I just don't know what else to tell you.\"   Now of course I'm totally appreciate of her candidness and openness about the problem... But I was shocked to hear the amount of DAILY  complaints that she stated and the nonchalant  attitude of corporate on what is, in my strong opinion, a huge risk for a patron and could potentially be a serious problem the restaurant proprietor.   I certainly have warned my family to stay out of that restaurant -  and especially not to take my elderly parents to lunch there.   All this to say there is no lunch cheap enough nor salad good enough for me to return and: ENTER THE BURNTWOOD TAVERN IN CROCKER PARK WESTLAKE, OH AT YOUR OWN RISK.   (I'm still rubbing my occasionally achy hip these days ... 2 1/2 weeks later!) :-( (Giving this place a 3 only because of the risk!)"}
{"text":"Sat in the covered patio. Everything seems so far away. Ex to get water they go into another room. Why not have a small station?  Also needs cleaning, crumbs on the chair and around. I get it's a Sat night but I would rather see some team work."}
{"text":"Kinda dark inside but brighter in seating area. Server amaxing for our large party. Kelly, i believe her name was. Pretty, looked clean, flashy smile to match her flashy jokes. Felt comfortable and at home with in moments. Food was AMAZING. Not one person in our group of 16 had to return their meal.  SPOT ON!!!!  Thats not the usual with big parties and while we never reprimand staff to the faces, we never blame them. Its hard to keep up with that many people. Wasnt even a thought in Kelly's mind . She and the cooks nailed it!! A++++"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for early lunch this past Sunday. Loved the Bloody Mary bar--had lots of fun things to add to it and different vodkas to choose from. Good was decent and service good. When in Crocker Park, would definitely consider going to for lunch but like any chain, wouldn't go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"A great experience.  Our waiter, Kevin, was so friendly, knowledgable, and attentive.  Our food came out well prepared and delicious.  This is an absolute beautiful restaurant. Cuyahoga Falls is lucky to have Burntwood."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend, her husband, and her little 1 year old for lunch on Sunday afternoon. They'd been here multiple times and said they liked their food. Me? I thought it was just ok.....  The restaurant itself is SUPER adorbs! It has that rustic feel to it when you walk in and it's just super cute!! LOVED that aspect. The restaurant itself was pretty empty when we walked in. Maybe a few people at the bar and about 2 other tables of people in the restaurant. So, with that in mind, I thought our server was extremely slow, unattentive, and MIA through a lot of our meal. We rarely saw her, so had to flag down some other people to get things we needed. Those people were pretty quick and helpful - so it could have just been a server specific thing. The entire time we were there, the restaurant reeked of gasoline. The manager came by a few times and was super kind about it and said he was investigating and wasn't sure what it was- was checking the kitchen and bathroom. And, when we brought it up to the server, she brushed it off and said that it probably happens all the time and has something todo with the sewer? clearly just didn't want to actually deal with it. again, I think the poor service was this particular server.  I noticed on the menu that they had a bloody mary bar! AWESOME! and they infuse their own vodka!!! Their vodka options include PICKLE, which I LOOOOVE (and cuke, ginger, and bacon). So, I got the pickle infused and went up to bar. They had a few hot sauces, and mixes to choose from. Then, they had meats, cheeses, olives, peppers, veggies, and pickles that you could add to your bloody mary. LOVED this! and loved my BM.  We ordered the \"Artichoke, Roasted Garlic, and Tasso Fondue\". The description says that it comes bubbling hot with pita chips..... liars! it was in a small ramekin and was not bubbling at all. I guess we were expecting something a bit more fonduey... don't get me wrong, the \"fondue\" itself was pretty tasty. The chips it came with were hard. And it came with pita triangles which were cold and dry.   I ordered the chicken philly and paid extra to get the tavern tater tots on the side. The chicken philly was a pretty dry so I asked for mayo/ranch and added that to the sandwich... helped a bit, but I just wasn't so impressed. The bread it came on was delish. Next time, I'll go with my instinct and try the caprese chicken- hopefully that's better. The tavern tots? I was expecting tater tots, and instead got these big balls that looked like deep fried chunks made of shredded hash browns. Definitely unique and I was definitely excited about it, but I just didn't love them. I thought they were super dense and dry. My friends agreed. They enjoyed their entrees for the most part, didn't enjoy the service that day, but said usually it wasn't like that.  Will I be back? Maybe. The place is just too adorable and I would love to go for HH on their patio with my friend when it gets warmer."}
{"text":"Great food!  A bit pricey for dinner, but lunch time menu is reasonably priced.  Staff is super friendly.  This place gets really busy after 5pm so call ahead to see if they can hold you a table.  Especially if you have a group of more than four."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a friend. The parking was easy, right in front of the restaurant. The atmosphere is clean and crisp, and the staff are very friendly. I love the tavern theme of the restaurant, because it can be deemed as professional, romantic, or as a nice brunch setting. It sits right along the river, and even has a small patio to go down closer. The menu has prized selections, and the food is wonderful. This was the first place I had a mimosa at, and they offer bottomless mimosas on Sundays. I had the Tavern Dip with Mac n Cheese as my meal and it was so good and filling. I would highly recommend going here, but be prepared to wait a little longer for your food."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and food is excellent!   Definitely wanna come on a nice evening to sit outside!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great and the atmosphere is amazing too! Come on the weekends for live entertainment. The drinks are expensive, but very, very good!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this tavern is excellent, with a balanced touch of rustic & refined. The menu is lengthy, well thought out, and in line with the rustic tavern appeal. I ordered the beer battered fish sandwich, and it was excellent. My girlfriend ordered the salmon sandwich with waffle fries, another solid choice. Our wait staff was timely and polite, and overall pleasant experience."}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant! We went recently with a group of friends, and the ambiance is perfect. There was live music by the door, which would be a little loud if you were sitting right next to them, but thankfully the tables are positioned a little further away, so it's a nice touch to a Friday night dinner.   The Solon restaurant was open and spaced well, but still felt cozy. Food and drinks were incredible, as expected, and prices are reasonable compared to other restaurants in the area. Service was great as well - our hostess and servers were hustling hard. Next time we visit, I want to check out their patio and happy hour menu.   Verdict: Definitely worth a visit if you've never tried it before!"}
{"text":"By far the worst uber eats experience, they should be removed from the program.  Overpriced pathetic burgers and sandwhiches, though do include a lot of decent fries.  They forgot a $14 (?!) steak salad and a $12 burger.  I had to re-order, and pay $10 in new delivery costs as my food was missing and hungry.  I notified them they messed up our order once, please don't again and take care of us this time.  The order that came a second time, at OUR cost was gross and pathetic.  The $12 burger is a $3 burger at mcdonalds, and the $14 (?!) steak salad, with egg, and all kinds of other stuff came as a few leaves of spinach and cheese.  NO STEAK (which they charge $7 (?!) separately for normally, no egg, no vegetables, nothing.  Now I've paid double the delivery... and still don't have the meals we ordered.  Our total was over $130 today.  If you treat $130 order customers that bad I'd hate to see a normal lunch order.  Pathetic.  Just give up while you're \"ahead\".  edit:  the pathetic burger was also rare.. unless a customer asks for a rare burger why would you provide one?!   our 3 cobb salads were an absolute joke... like seriously laughable..  Cant' even be mad so pathetic.  You guys have a lot to learn.. I fear you'll be out of business shortly.  AWEFUL"}
