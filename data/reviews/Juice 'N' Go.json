{"text":"super healthy! You can customize your bowls with different fruits, seeds etc. This place is perfect for quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this place.... My family and I are repeat customers... And thanks for the great customer service every time we go it's the same!!"}
{"text":"The owner is going to ruin his business with horrible customer service and temper! The acai bowls are good, but it is overshadowed by his negative energy. I feel bad for his employees to have to deal with such a tyrant! If you decide to try it out don't order additional toppings unless you don't mind paying .99 for just four raspberries and an organic attitude. HEALTHY food and positive ENERGY go hand and hand and this business now lacks it!!!"}
{"text":"Really great service!  Like the coconut water options.  And they gave my dog treats :)"}
{"text":"Juice was amazing and very reasonably priced!! The guys working were awesome and gave us a deal for it being our first time in.  They even offered a sample of another juice on the house!  Great way to get loyal customers.  I will be definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"If looking for a new healthy snack alternative, this really is a great way to go. Easy to access, you don't even have to get out of your car, which for me is a when. Lots of options of fresh pickings to choose from and mix and match as you please. However personally I feel that it is overpriced, and it seemed like I was waiting in the heat for my bowl forever. Though I am no acai bowl expert, this being my only one ever tried, I thought it was delicious and met my wants of a healthy refreshing snack. Would I go back? Maybe. Not a regular spot I would go to, but is define toy worth the try and the occasional treat."}
{"text":"Juice 'N' Go is absolutely amazing! The people that work there are incredibly nice & very helpful for a first time customers. What they sell is fantastic! Everything is very health conscious & organic. Plus, it's like going to an awesome salad bar but instead of getting a boring salad you get to create your own adventurous smoothies, juices, sandwiches, etc. If you want some refreshing and delicious without the guilt of a fats, processed carbs, high fructose corn syrup & preservatives I'd definitely recommend this place. It's a drive up, so it's quick & easy for on the go.   I got the traditional acai bowl w/ a lemon limeade & I was not disappointed one bit! Perfect breakfast for after the gym :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. it's a small drive thru/ walk up only, but it's delicious. yes there's a bit of a wait usually for the food to be prepared and made, but I say it's well worth. and the customer service is never bad."}
{"text":"Love this place I come at least once a week to get a healthy start to my day! So yummy and fresh!  great customer service aswell !"}
{"text":"Tried the acai bowl and did not like it at all.  Super sweet without real acai flavor.    It is a little bit better than Bowl of Heaven I think."}
{"text":"good acai bowl but super slow service! make sure you have enough time to wait... to really wait..."}
{"text":"I'm totally obsessed with there acai bowls! Yummm!!  I'm so glad I have found a tasty, heathy anytime snack! I'm all about fresh, raw and eating healthy options.  The staff is always super friendly and attentive.  Never diss ap"}
{"text":"I got the acai bowl. It was a drive thru where you order through a microphone then you pull up to get your bowl. It took only a few mins to make the bowl. The acai berry bowl was really big and it came with bananas, strawberry, blueberries, granola, and coconut shavings. It was yummy, but the acai berry was kinda watery. I like it when it is thicker."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  While out and about doing errands on my day off I didnt want to get out of the car for any food but I was hungry for something.. man I'm so happy I found this small green pop out building lol  my first order was a cinnamon bagel that comes with pb&j or ab&j I opted for almond butter instead.  My smoothie was heavenly I drank half of it and got sad that the other half was all I had left.. not a bad location.  However I learned quick that the orders will be faster if I call them ahead of time.. organic ingredients and friendly service you can not have a bad day with this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We have been coming here since they opened. The staff is great, you just don't find service like this anywhere in town. My kids do Jiu-Jitsu down the street, and love the refreshing Acai and Pitaya bowls after a hard work out! Can't say enough good about these guys!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since it opened and there hasn't been anything on the menu that doesn't satisfy my tastebuds! The guys here are always really nice and make sure we are satisfied. Best acai bowls in Vegas!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. Super disappointed with the quality of the fruit. Got the traditional acai bowl and the blueberries looked like flat raisins. Not to mention there's only 5 of them. By the photos I saw which led me to order this item I also expected more fruit. Mine seemed to be mostly acai mix that wasn't very flavorful. Bowlology is 10 times better than this place. :("}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing, traditional acai bowl is a bomb. The stuff is friendly, lady is always so nice to me and my coworkers since we eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"OMG THE BEST YOU CANNOT GO WRONG.  My husband is a meat and potato guys and is hooked now at Juice N Go!! Staff is super cool too!! Love it that it's not chain-y.!  We always have a fun time coming to the drive through and looking forward to patronizing this location. Don't compromise a thing and keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"My bro & I drove from San Diego and made it a point to stop here during our stay to nourish the body with fresh healthy food while on the go!  We shared an \"Acai Bowl\" which was all kinds of AWESOMENESS & made with lotsa LOVE!  A \"Piña Colada Smoothie\" made with all organic ingredients, nothing artificial & no sugar added :)  And a sun-dried tomato \"Wrap\" with hand-carved prime roast beef, organic mixed greens, onions, tomatoes, gourmet cheese, with a ranch/Dijon drizzle.... DELISH!!!!!!!!!!!  DOGS EAT FOR FREE ALL DAY EVERYDAY!!!  My lil guy got the royal treatment as he inhaled a plate of  \"Hand-Carved Prime Roast Beef!\"  NomNomNom!  The owner Alex has a heart of gold and is a very thoughtful & generous human being.  His approach to this business, his interaction with his customers & his natural nurturing ways all shine in his service & food shared amongst everyone!  Dont miss an opportunity to eat well & be greeted with love!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place in Vegas to get an acai bowl! I've been coming here for a little over a year now and never been disappointed.  Only complaint is the epoxy app used for stamp rewards. It's wiped my stamps a few times when it logs me out. One suggestion, please open Sundays!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the acai bowl.  Fresh fruit and it tastes so good. A perfect snack.  The people working there are always friendly and courteous.  I go a couple times a week.  I haven't tried any of the food so I can't comment on that, but the smoothies and acai bowls are great.  They definitely need to stay open later than 6 so I can make it there in time after work, and I have no idea why they are closed on Sundays.  After 6 and Sundays are prime acai bowl times!!!!"}
{"text":"Acai bowl is amazing and well worth the 7.99 for the large size. Fresh ingredients and each bite is like a orgasm in your mouth, no joke. Strawberries, blueberries, great tasting oats, a dash of honey and many more items I don't remember because I ate it so quickly! The owner Alex is very friendly and I will be back with friends and family, that's for sure!   Locally owned business that makes you feel at home! Although there's no sit down area, this is a secret of Las Vegas that you must try!!!! What are you waiting for!?!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my new favorite spots. I ordered a stawberry/banana/coconut water + energy boost smoothie and a turkey sandwich on ciabatta bread.  I was super impressed all for just $10. Legit food/drink + friendly service makes this place a winner"}
{"text":"Worst Acai bowl I've ever had . Watered down and not good flavor. I've been to plenty juice places and have never had an experience like the one I just had . Plus they charge extra for honey"}
{"text":"Everything is made fresh and tastes great!! I plan on trying all the blends they have available."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. We go there at least once a week and they have great tasting acai bowls and great service. 10/10"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place!!! I've been craving an Acai Bowl and they didn't disappoint! It was delicious! The service was outstanding and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always yummy!  very polite, and happy employees.   I am so happy you are in the process of expanding to more than one location.   :)"}
{"text":"This is my first time at Juice N Go. I loved the customer service, but I feel for a place that seems like it uses the most natural of ingredients, it doesn't taste completely natural to me. The taste isn't much different than tropical smoothy. It is overpriced considering they don't use the most natural of ingredients for the base of whatever you order.  If you want a place that uses most natural I would go to Nectar in downtown summerlin.  I made my own juice, and when I make my own juice at juice bars I always get the same one. This one was the worst one I tried. I love the natural taste of the juice without sweetener added to it. I didn't read the sign correctly I'm guessing, but when I create my own juice I would assume nothing but what I ordered would be added to it. Im assuming they used a coconut water( not natural). To make my own small14-16 oz juice cost me $8 which is a ridiculous cost when its not all natural juice and you use coconut water to fill the cup. Again you can go to nectar and get a 32 oz cup of nothing but natural juice for $8.  I also got a Acai bowl, like many others said it was soupy melted within 2 minuets ice like flavor. I paid extra for extra granola which I didn't seem to have much extra of. The granola is popcorn like. Again the bowl is un naturally sweetened somehow just like the juice really taking away the greatness from fresh juice and fresh fruit bowls. I have had much better fresher tasting bowls and juices at many other juice bars, if your a juice fanatic and really care about the quality of whats being put inside the bowls and juice, I wouldn't bother trying this place. But if your someone who is giving there first try to juicing and eating healthy or super busy on the go person def try this place, because this is better than the typical drive through. Again I thought customer service was good, and it didn't take too long, I just disliked the quality for the price."}
{"text":"Went here today! Had an amazing acai bowl. Great service and super fast for anybody on the go!"}
{"text":"There's not much I can say about this place that hasn't already been said so I'll just sum it up: It is amazing!!  Never judge a book by it's cover because from the outside I was having second thoughts for a moment, but it changed quickly. They have outstanding customer service, offering me complimentary iced tea while waiting, and the large acai bowl did not disappoint either! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love the acai bowl. I  add dragonfruit  into my acai bowl. It is so delicious. The employees are warm and personable. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Best acai bowls in Las Vegas,  hands down! Awesome customer service. The guy was nice enough to have us Park our car on the side because it was scoring hot that day. He walked over to deliver our acai bowls to us,  and even upgraded our acai bowls to large with no charge!"}
{"text":"had some strawberry secret bowl.... was da bizniz. my girl and i would have tht over icecream any day. hands down the best refreshing yogurt in vegas. spread da word and tell all ur frenz."}
{"text":"Nice service, delicious food. Can't really ask for more! Location was a little odd, but definitely not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"I'm from California and acai bowls are amazing. I have tried a few other places but this place was really great. It was a little random spot in the middle of the parking lot and I wish there was another location that was closer to me but this was worth it. Everything was amazing. I asked for extra honey and they hooked it up! The fruit was great and very fresh.  The portion sizes were huge as well and worth the price. This place is better than bowl of heaven forsure."}
{"text":"Everything about this joint screams happy and healthy. This is a cute little drive thru with all natural, organic, and freshly made food. There are a variety of things like acai bowls, wraps, smoothies and more. The staff is always incredibly friendly, and can accommodate all order changes or needs. The drive thru will take a little bit of time, but not any longer than a long line that you wait in at a fast food place. The prices are a little steep, BUT considering everything is fresh and organic this is expected. I personally find it worth the money. My favorite thing to get is the Traditional Acai Bowl which comes with granola, acai smoothie, and a variety of fruit (bananas, strawberries and blueberries). I substitute blueberries for pineapple, and it is so good. Great refreshing snack or meal on the healthy side, for on the go. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Love it. They're open early so its a perfect stop if you're on your way out of town for some out doors. I usually have a smoothie with coconut water and the other ingredients vary. I've also had the coco water blend and it was just as delicious as the smoothie. You can taste the freshness of each ingredient. I haven't been let down so far. I think that the only difference I would really make would be maybe a suggestion board for people like me who are indecisive and can't figure out what to combine...but that can just be a personal problem on my end."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. If I could 10 star it I definitely  would ! Employees are wonderful and their acai bowl was perfect. Never have had a acai bowl and I was definitely not disappointed! I would recommend this for anyone. Oh and they make a great meal replacement"}
{"text":"Great place, best Acai in las vegas! Wish they had a location in summerlin"}
{"text":"This place has really delicious acid bowls but their prices are ridiculous for a cup. Even with the set bowl items the total is 8-9 which is as much as a regular meal."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to their Acai Bowl and it ended up more like a smoothie.  There was no texture, instead it was waterly and wasn't what I expected.  I also ordered a juice for my husband, whom enjoyed his juice.  I don't know if I would be going back to get an Acai bowl, but I might consider going back to try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Only ever gotten their traditional acai bowls and smoothies. Sooooo good! It's a bit pricey for me, so I don't go often, but when I feel like eating something good and have an extra $10 for a bowl, I drop by. Really good and fresh fruit."}
{"text":"Open until 8pm now according to their FB...it's summmmertime!!!!  I started this review over a month ago and I forgot to submit it!  So the first time I went I got a acai bowl loaded with fruit and granola...not sure if the granola has honey in it :( I forgot to ask. If you are vegan DON'T FORGET TO ASK because I'm not sure.  Anyway. I ordered the bowl and asked for it to be made with coconut milk instead of soy. They did it no problem.  Now here is the deal...it says alllllllll over there signs and even the guy that took the order said it too...it's cut and made to order so that's why it takes longer. Ok. well explain why ever time I have gotten a bowl there the fruit is frozen. It has not frost bite but it def has a SUPER THIN ice on it and it's hard to the bite.  I'm not bitching about fresh frozen fruit I eat it at home in my smoothies daily. I'm just saying it always surprises me to get the fruit this way when each time the guy says it's fresh cut. LOL!  The mango smoothie that I got hubby once there was super good.   I really don't know how often I will make it this far Rainbow, even though I live on Rainbow these bowls are no out of the ordinary bowls that I can not stay at home and make with my Vitamix :)"}
{"text":"Decided to get a healthy after meal dessert and the smoothie I ordered definitely did not disappoint.  I had the apple base smoothie with mango and strawberries and it helped alleviate the heaviness of our lunch meal.  There's not much I can add in addition to all the hype revolving this place and I did not get the chance to try their acai bowl, but would like to plan on it the next time I'm in town.  The drive-thru kind of took a while, but the deliciousness and freshness of the drinks made it worthwhile.  Everyone enjoyed their smoothies and one of my friends had the fruit yogurt which basically looked like a parfait and he thoroughly enjoyed it as well.    All in all I'd say this is a for sure stop when I'm in town and next time I'll make it a point to try their acai bowl!  Given the fact that the weather was bleh and we had such a heavy meal prior to our visit over here, it was a good picker upper :)"}
{"text":"These guys are great but... I have been there twice and everytime I have had to wait at least 15 minutes to get my order and their was only two of us in line. The second time I sat in the drive thru for 10 minutes. I left without giving them my order. This happened on April 20th. I know what they do takes time but dang its slow."}
{"text":"Had this one earlier this month, brought to me by a friend, in a large size. She gave it to me right after i ate lunch. Yet, somehow... still was able to finish that gigantic (large) acai bowl. I'd say that large container, was maybe a pint. give for take. Not a small portion.   Topped with fresh fruit (strawberries, bananas, blueberries, and coconut shavings), to me, first thought... \"this is what i should eat after going to the gym huh...\" XD The Traditional Acai (Ah-sa-ee) bowl is made with organic acai, guarana (apparently rich in caffeine), strawberries, non-fat frozen yogurt blended w/ choice of apple juice, coconut milk, or soy milk. Topped with organic granola, coconut shavings, and either agave nectar or honey.   The first one i had was topped with agave nectar, felt like the bowl, as a whole, lacked a little bit more of the sweetness (didnt know honey was an option, and suggested to friend, maybe honey would do better). The acai and the fruit was bright and refreshing but light. But with tons of organic granola (score!). It's almost a meal in its own  2nd time, i had went myself in search for \"breakfast\", went through the drive thru. Was told through intercom that they will be with me in just a minute... a minute later, i hear a voice off to the side while i was concentrating on the menu outside.. XD the guy walked up with a notepad to take my order LOL that was a surprise.. Judging by my first experience of the large, i thought the regular was maybe the same type of cup/bowl, but shorter. After i pulled up to the window, to my surprise, it was a regular cup size, and tall. Then i thought, DANG ! for $1 difference, should have gotten the large ! XD so worth it for large ;_; Cut fruits were topped with honey this time and presented nicely. I was wrong about the honey though. it adds a .. different flavor to it.. maybe not so good with honey. maybe next time ill ask for agave nectar again but a little more?   Experience noted. Get Large instead of Regular.. the regular was finished by the time i got home.. and i only live like 10 minutes away. Err... Maybe ask for a little more granola too (love granola for some reason... XD om nom nom)"}
{"text":"I love this place. So fresh and absolutely delicious!! It's a must try. I wish they were open on Sundays! I always crave an acai bowl after time in the sun. So refreshing!"}
{"text":"The owner has terrible customer service!! First he refused service because I asked if I could have my bowl put in a larger cup. AND I DIDN'T MIND PAYING EXTRA, BTW.  We ordered 2 large Acai Bowls, added extra toppings and for $3-4 extra received about 4 pineapples and 4 blueberries. I asked them if they could put my bowl in a larger cup rather than short change me on the other ingredients attempting to fit everything in the same size cup. Again every time I've came here I've mentioned that I don't mind paying extra for a larger cup. POOR, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND NOT A WAY TO RUN ANY BUSINESS!!  Will not be coming here again and don't recommend his place to anyone unfortunately after my experience. And again this is my experience I can only speak for myself."}
{"text":"This place has the best acai bowls in Las Vegas! Ever since I discovered this place, I tried all the other acai bowl spots and nothing can compare to Juice N Go. The reason why I enjoy this place out of all the others is that the acai is fairly sweet and not to the point where it tastes like diabetes. If you are on the edge from sizing up, just size up because it is definitely worth it but make sure you have another person to help you finish it! Only downside is that it is a drive thru but hey thats why its called Juice n Go."}
{"text":"Hands down best juice and selection in Vegas! Maca powder!"}
{"text":"I am literally writing this review as I sit in my car in their drive thru. It's only a drive thru, hence explaining why it's called juice n go (which is convenient for me because I don't t have to get out of my car lol.) It is also convenient for me because its literally down my street lol. It's a cute shack in the middle of a parking lot on Sahara and Oakey. The wait was a little longer than I thought and it seems as if there's only one person taking and making orders. I have extra time so I didn't mind at all and their workers are always very friendly and nice!  I came here for their traditional acai bowl and they're always upgrading my regular to a large! What more could I ask for! I think their price is good for what you get, but honestly I gave it 4 stars because nothing beats acai to the t . The acai bowl itself was pretty good and legit I'd have to say. Good place for a quick drive to get some acai on a hot day!  A traditional bowl was basically an apple based sorbet style acai blended with banana and strawberry, topped with coconut shavings, blueberries, strawberries, bananas, honey, and granola. You can also customize it however you want."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for the last couple of years, and I swear it just keeps getting better. I always get the carrot juice, which is always made fresh to order. Another favorite are the wraps! I always build my own, favoring veggieburger, hummus, cheese and veggies. Vegetables are always fresh and the portions are generous! Expect to wait a few minutes, since nothing is premade. Totally worth it though! You can also call ahead to order, which makes pick up very easy."}
{"text":"YUM! So happy to have found a healthy, tasty, and friendly option for after-work snacks and emergency lunches. Menu offers bowls, a few breakfast/lunch wrap options, and juices/smoothies.  The HUGE acai bowl is my favorite thing here- it is blended and frothy at the bottom without being icy, and the granola and fruit on top make it similar to a parfait. The regular is like $7 while the large is only a dollar more- an $8 meal, which isn't bad considering all of the nutrition it packs!  Bonus star for stellar service! For my first purchase, I was allowed to try the large size bowl at the cost of the regular, which was much appreciated and worth it. Employees are friendly and upbeat, but the line does move really slowly.  EDIT: Dropping a star. Over the past year, quality has taken a nosedive. The acai bowls are now over blended to the point that they're a smoothie consistency, and a flavorless one at that. I used to stop by regularly for healthy lunches and post-workout snacks, but I've stopped because of the product decline."}
{"text":"Great place to get an acai bowl in Vegas. I purchased a regular traditional bowl and there was plenty in there. Fresh banana, strawberries, and blueberries topping it along with granola, honey, and coconut shavings. The chicken quesadilla is also tasty. Good customer service and easy to pick up in the drive thru."}
{"text":"I could never say it enough, their customer service is Amazing! They can create anything you want pretty much. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend go here at least once or twice a week! The parfaits and Acai bowls are so bomb! The staff is always super friendly and helpful. Next time you go try a chesadilla with the sun dried tomato tortilla!"}
{"text":"I love this place! So tasty and such a nice staff. The weight can be long sometimes but it is totally worth it. I get an acai bowl with peaches instead of banana with extra of their delicious granola! I live a few minutes away and do a call in order to avoid he wait which is super convenient!"}
{"text":"I'm always craving acai bowls, especially when I want something refreshing and healthy, but tasty as well. Here at Juice N Go, I usually just order the traditional bowl because it tastes delicious as it is, I don't have a particular preference that I'd want to change. With that said, I absolutely love the quality and taste that Juice N Go offers. On top of that, they have excellent customer service. They always make sure they get your order right and even upgraded my bowl to a large during my first visit. Whenever you're in a rush, or just simply don't want to wait that long for something to eat, definitely give Juice N Go a try. It's also a healthier alternative to your typical fast food chains."}
{"text":"This place has the best acai bowls in town! Had my first acai bowl here and I fell in love! Prices are reasonable considering how much product you get. Four stars only because it is the only location in Vegas. I suggest expand! Preferably to the south side. But I would once in a while drive 12 miles north because they are so worth it!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. My friend ordered 3 acai bowls while I waited in the car. The place is really small and they only do take-out. However, my acai bowl tasted A M A Z I N G!!! I'm a fruit person and I loved how all the fruits and nuts blended in together. I am seriously craving it right now as I'm typing haha. Anyone who wants to just grab something light, Juice-N-Go is the place!"}
{"text":"I've only had the Acai bowl so this review is based strictly on that. If I happen to get anything else I'll be sure to update my review.  Anyways, I was actually very surprised with their Acai bowl. I've heard a lot of good things about it, but I figured, \"How good can a bowl of fruit be?\" Apparently very good.  They use fresh tasting fruit and the Acai smoothie/juice part is refreshing. I definitely recommend getting the larger size because it is way more worth the price. Everything mixes very well, from the banana to the strawberry, to the granola, and it's just takes a quick drive through. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu some time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. Good customer service and really good fresh food.. They take a Lil longer but it's OK"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Always fresh and our large orders always correct. Our department placed a large order 2 days in a row and when we went to pick it up they gave us all large parfaits at the regular size rate. Way to keep the DRI family coming back!"}
{"text":"After visiting a health food/smoothie bar in SD, my boyfriend and I became obsessed with Acai bowls. We never thought there was anything that would even come close to it in Vegas. Much to our surprise, we discovered juice n go. They offer amazing Acai bowls, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We can't wait to come back and try their pitaya bowls."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!!!! Best smoothies and Acai bowls I can find out in Vegas. I wish it was closer to my house so I could go here daily. Keep up the awesome juicing! This place rocks! On top of yummy products, their service is alway on point."}
{"text":"Wow! We each got a coconut water blend. The wife got one with pineapple, mango and banana which was really good. Not too sweet, none of the fruits overpowering the drink, a really refreshing blend. I got one with pineapple, mango and peach. I really enjoyed both if them. The size was quite surprising when they came out with our regulars ($2.99).  When we went there was only one person in front of us ordering. They processed them pretty quickly and were to us in no time. The workers were nice. I was also pleasantly surprised at how quickly they made our order. I'm definitely excited to try some of their food. If they only has a happy hour!"}
{"text":"First time my bf and I went to juice n go after all the raving yelp reviews and this place is awesome!  Didn't really know what to get but the guy was really helpful and even gave us both large acai bowls for the price of a medium! While we were waiting for our bowls he even gave us complimentary passion fruit teas (not sure if that was just a first timer special). The large bowl is basically the size of a tub but we both ended up finishing them because they were so delicious! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Give this place a try after searching the city for acai bowls. Amazing, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The time on yelp is wrong. I went here trying to get something for breakfast about 8:45 & pulled up and the hrs were posted stating they opened at 9:30. I went to Tropical smoothie instead."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are IN LOVE with Juice N Go! The food and smoothies are so yummy! The employees are sweet and the prices are extremely fair for the portions. We love to get the smoothie/wrap combo. The wraps are HUGE! Our favorite is the C wrap (vegetarian) and I usually do their green smoothie.   Part of me wishes they had a normal store front to dine in. However, I worry if they did that they wouldn't have a drive thru! The drive thru makes it super convenient to get something delicious and healthy on the go and the wait isn't usually too rough. As a tip, they take orders over the phone for you to come and pick up! So, if you're crunched on time, consider that as an option.   Wish they were opened on Sunday as that is the only shared day off for my boyfriend and I. Oh well! There are 6 other days in the week to enjoy this little gem."}
{"text":"the best acai bowls I've ever had. they can get busy but it's worth it.   revision: I've been here a bunch of times but today this is the first time it was watery and no flavor."}
{"text":"I have Terri R to blame for this review! She made me a fan!  Actually, Juice 'N' Go did it on their own. There's too many things I do love about them, here are some of the highlights:  - You can customize your acai bowl, juice or smoothie. They have pitaya, rice milk, whey protein, a variety of ingredients! I tried their veggie wrap my last visit, you can pick and choose what goes in those. Very accommodating!  - Lots of organics  - No preservatives  - KIDS EAT FREE EVERYDAY! (with a $9.99 purchase)  They're definitely not in my neighborhood. There's a wait for your order at times. Nevertheless, I think 5 stars is warranted, mostly for their great service. They always been courteous, friendly, and delivered some great acai bowls that makes me not mind waiting when they're busy. Call in your order ahead!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for a quick and healthy meal. I stopped by for their famous Acai Bowl. I ordered a large one for $7.95 with pineapple, acai & blueberries with agave nectar.   This was delicious, I was so hungry that I finished the whole bowl. The organic granola adds a great crunch to each bite. It's definitely one of the best.   One negative thing about this place  is that it's drive through only so you'll have to eat the food in your car.  And it's a long drive from Henderson, they should open a location in South once they are ready to expand. It's unique food and they'll be very successful."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this same location for over 2 years now. I can honestly say every single time it's been fantastic. Everyone that works there is always super cool & they always hook me up! Every different item that I've tried here has been equally delicious. The picture that I'm posting is of my favorite item. \"The Acai / Pitaya Bowl\"  it's probably one of the best things that you could put in your body in the morning. I want to really thank these guys for great organic food and I'll definitely be a customer for life."}
{"text":"This is a very lengthy post but this was my first and last experience at this place. If you want the truth, here it is:  I was a first time visitor, going through their drive through. First of all, doesn't the name Juice N \"GO\" apply that they will be fast? Anyways, I pull up and before I can say anything the guy tells me to hang on for a sec. 10 minutes go by, and I finally say that I'm ready to order. I got no response still, and then someone came out of the inside and wrote down my order on a notepad. He didn't apologize or state why I wasn't ordering through the speaker, just asked me what I wanted. I thought it was a little weird. Then I pull up to the window. 10 more minutes go by and a different guy comes to the window and says \"I'm sorry we're understaffed today.\" and walked away before I got the chance to say anything. So by now, it's been 20 minutes. No total on my order, no food, nothing. 10 more minutes go by. The guy who took my order finally comes to the window. I just simply asked to speak with the manager. He begins to say he was giving me my bagel for free and how \"we are not McDonald's.\" I told him I could make a smoothie and clean my blender in under 3 minutes, how long did it really take him? He never answered that question. He also asked me if I wanted to cancel my order and I said no. I'm not sure why he said anything to me when the first thing I did was ask for the manager. During this, the guy behind me literally pulled out backwards and left the drive through, so I brought that up. He said \"that's fine,\" and presumed to walk away. Then he came back and said the manager \"didn't want to talk to me because they are too busy.\" I had no words. I just asked for my total. He gave it to me and walked away without making any exchange. It was now 35 minutes later, I know this because I tweeted right when I got there, and the manager comes to the window. He says, \"You wanted to talk to me?\" I said, \" you didn't want to talk to me.\" He says, \"well I apologize but we are not McDonald's and the bagel's on the house.\" I told him I could pay the $2 I just wanted my food. He then asked \"do you want to cancel your order?\" I never implied this, I even told the other guy no. So I just said no. I brought up the guy leaving the drive through to him as well, and his exact words were \"I don't care.\" at least the other guy said that's fine. Then the manager asked ME what my balance was. I said \"you tell me, I don't work here.\" That must've been his last straw or something, because he then said he was refusing me service and told me not to come back, and shut and locked the drive through window. There was no signs about refusing anyone service, or any signs at all by the window. I was appalled. I literally waited 35-40 minutes to be rejected service. I was frustrated after 30 minutes, but I used no profanity. I even offered to still pay for the bagel. Apparently, the manager turns out to be the owner, and I think his son was the other guy I was dealing with. Don't go here."}
{"text":"First time trying Acai bowls and I loved it!!!!  So here is a small little shack with both a walk up and drive up window. I came her to grab a regular size bowl with their awesome fixing. You get their sweet crunchy granola, yummy shaved coconuts and a drizzle of either agave or honey and your choice of 2 fruits. Addition topping is $1 so I added kiwi. Oh man was that a bad idea the kiwi was kind of spicy and I ended up throwing them all out but no worries if it is your first visit they upgrade you to a large size, Awesome!   We also ordered the Hot chicken with ranch on ciabatta bread with all the veggies. It came with a hand full of tortilla chips and the sandwich was so yummy. A little on the healthy side (of coarse) but it was perfect no mayo, slices chick and yummy lite ranch all on toasted ciabatta and baby arugula with pepper jack so good. The kids quesadilla was grill on a very good wheat tortilla and I'm not sure what kind of cheese it was cause it smelt funny but taste so so good! Also that item was on the house with our order of over $10 bucks because with any order over $10 you get a free kids item whoop whoop.   Let me just say that the guy that helped us was so awesome and it was like we were getting hooked up all over the place and I was loving it. I will definitely be back I only wish they had a closer location to me I would be there everyday because the whole family was super satisfied!"}
{"text":"Ahhh....  This was my very first acai place I tried when I moved to Vegas 4years ago and I loved it then... I was on this side of town so I was excited to have it again but unfortunately this visit was a disappointment.   Coming here is very quick and easy since it is a cute tiny drive up in the the middle of one of the shopping center parking lots. I drove up, took my order, man kindly gave me my order and it looked bomb.com. It was until I finally started to eat it. All of the fruits I had except the bananas were frozen.... Sorry but I anticipate for fresh fruit, not frozen fruits lacking flavor tasting like ice... I hate that I have to lower my star review.. Is it because it's still kinda winter time that their fruits weren't ready...idk?"}
{"text":"i wish they would open up more of these throughout the valley. When we lived on this side of town I'd come here about once a week and while I was pregnant I'd come closer to three times a week. This little shack does get busy but to be honest I do not mind. The quality that comes from this place is worth waiting for and based on the size of their work area I imagine it can't be anymore than 1-2 people working on getting these orders done. I was told you can order ahead of time which is convenient. I typically always get either an acai bowl or a p3 bowl. I'm never disappointed! everything is SO fresh. I got my hubby hooked on this place and he isn't typically into this type of food/refreshments."}
{"text":"There are pros and cons to this place. I used to think this was my go to spot for acai bowls til I realized that the quality could be better. All in all, I go here when it is convenient and on the way.  PROS: The menu contains lots of options for different bowls or you can customize your own which is the best thing about this place.  The drive thru makes ordering quick and easy.  They have tons of options on fruits, veggies, and toppings for your bowl.  The pricing is reasonable and portion is huge.  They carry dairy free milks.   CONS: I cannot stand that most of their fruits come frozen on top.. it takes away from the freshness that a standard acai bowl should have.  Their granola could be better. I used to get the gluten free granola because it tastes better to me, but for some reason it's usually stale and hard to chew.  I tend to add ginger in my acai bowls, but whenever i pay the up charge, i feel like its not even worth it since i can barely taste ginger."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this gem and so happy we did! Amazing customer service . When we drove up to the window they asked if it was our first time, then came out to explain the menu! We both got the green juice and it was so yummy! Plus we got a free smoothie for our son cause kids eat/ drink free everyday!!! We will defiantly be back:) highly recommend"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and the food was amazing!  I had a veggie burger on ciabatta and it had to be the best veggie burger I have ever eaten.  I'm not sure if the patties are homemade but they taste better than anything I have bought in a store or restaurant.  I also tried a few other items that I shared with my family:  Salad - Super fresh and was great with the champagne vinaigrette  Smoothie - Perfectly sweet and delcious.  (we had ours with banana, peaches, strawberries and coconut water)  Acai Bowl - Very tasty with ripe fresh fruit and delicious natural ingredients, it gave me a nice energy boost.  Since I had read the reviews on Yelp already I was prepared for a wait, but it was really not very long.  They did forget to give me my salad dressing, but when I went back to get it they gave me a coupon for my next visit.  The staff is very nice and helpful which makes those little inconveniences tolerable, as well as having delicious food.  I am so glad I stumbled on this tasty place!  It is definitely going to be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. So fresh, so yummy!! Get the acai bowl, delicious! Alex is great."}
{"text":"I love this place for their acai bowls. I always get the original, served traditional. Which means blueberries, bananas, strawberries, coconut shavings with honey. The fruit is always fresh, & served atop the acai fat free yogurt blend, which is amazing.  I'm not a fan of any type of yogurt (frozen, regular, Greek, etc) but this acai yogurt blend definitely has my attention and is worth trying!  They have a regular size and a large size, for $1 more. The large is a generous portion and often I can't finish it all.   The fruit smoothies are also awesome, again regular and large (+$1). This isn't order by numbers, all smoothies are customized. They give you options for the base liquid (juice or coconut water) as well as your fruit options.   This place has a drive thru, which can be a narrow squeeze for big trucks. I believe they also have a walk up window to order from, so don't let your vehicle stop you from trying this place! Everything is made to order, so be prepared to wait a few minutes. But it's never taken too long, and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Juice N Go is one of my favorite açaí bowl locations in Vegas. I always come and get the fresh fruit parfait. It comes with bananas, blue berries, strawberries, granola and yogurt. I elect to not get the blue berries but it's seriously the best parfait you will ever have. It's a drive thru business so be prepared not to sit down inside and eat. But your car ride is going to be very tasteful. I wish they would open more locations. Please please please open more locations!!"}
{"text":"this place is a bit out of the way for us but was totally worth the drive and wait. the acai bowls we had were AWESOME!! they do a FREE kids menu item with purchases of $9.99 or more so we scored a free smoothie for my son!! he said the strawberry smoothie was delicious.   we will definitely be back. however, i think we'll be calling in our order in advance next time."}
{"text":"Sooooooo amazing. Great raw food. Delicious too! Not too sweet. No sugar!"}
{"text":"Quality acai bowls every time I come here. I usually get the traditional acai bowl with coconut milk and extra coconut shavings on top. It's not too sweet and not too bland, it's a perfect in between. If you do like extra sweet, I'd say to request the acai bowl to be made with apple juice instead of soy milk or coconut milk.   Juice N Go offers food items as well. I remember many moons ago I ordered some sort of wrap or sandwich and it was very good (I can't remember the name of it, however). These guys have a drive-thru and a separate window you can walk right up to and order. Good people run this place."}
{"text":"I've been to this place on multiple occasions and ordered many variations of the same thing. I highly recommend making your own burger here - it's definitely a fun experience.   The Acai Bowls are never going to be a bad idea, and the lemonade - heaven really... just heaven in your mouth.   Personally it's a bit over priced for just to go but obviously I understand because it's more natural foods etc... and more often than not when it's lunch time the line gets incredibly long it seems and I've waited more  than 25 minutes here for food before.   Occasionally you get surprised with \"complimentary\" chips or chocolate covered acai berries which is always a good treat and business tool they use ... makes people feel special when they use the word, complimentary haha..  I wish they had more locations!!  I'm on Tropicana and Decatur if you guys are taking suggestions for your next stop!!"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and wanted to try my first açaí bowl. I'm happy this was my first choice since everyone after seemed to be not as good. The staff is nice and always gets my order right even when I use postmates. It has a drive thru and walk up window. The hours of operation do change depending on the season so look out for that."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place. Seems everytime I go they are too busy or closed. After many attempts I'm really glad I got to try the acai bowl. I ordered a regular and it was huge, I can't even imagine what a large looks like.  The bowl had fresh berries, bananas, coconut shavings and honey. Delicious!!!!!   I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"So delicious. you have to try the coco water blends so refreshing and delicious! Not quite like a smoothie and not just like water. More like the consistency of an Aqua Fresca. Delicious. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"I love this place I go at least twice a week I love their bowls they are all so delicious and healthy with fresh fruit the staff is always nice and if it's your first time here no worries they guide and suggest things to you! The only thing is they can get rely busy sometimes that the wait time is a little annoying"}
{"text":"Decided to give my prego belly a post work out treat! It was an easy drive-thru find, with my yelp map, and it's yellow building. If you're heading North on Rainbow, make a left on Oakey, and it will be in a little complex to your right. The menu is small, but straight to the point. I obviously went with the norm, which is their regular acai bowl. I have been craving an acai bowl for months and the countless Instagram posts I've seen from my friends, hit right on target. I also decided to get a salad ( mixed spring greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers), with no protein. Everything tasted fresh, I pretty much inhaled the acai bowl and salad. The acai bowl was refreshing, just the right amount of granola, bananas. berries, and blended acai ( slushy texture). I didn't really  have a long wait for my items as posted on Yelp, was expecting longer. I definitely be back! :-)"}
{"text":"I just started juicing and it is very time consuming cutting fruits and veggies especially when you are on a time constraint! This is the perfect place to grab your juice on the go when you are busy. I will most likely become a regular! Shout out to the staff, you guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh and healthy stuff! The Acai bowl is a perfect breakfast or anything. If you're in a hurry, call in your order. They are getting busy and the wait times does suck but it's worth it"}
{"text":"Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  I don't care where in Vegas you live, you MUST come get some food from here.  Fresh locally sourced high quality ingredients.  Great service.  Easy to customize smoothies and sandwiches with tons of choices.  It will take awhile to get your food, but the best things in life come with a wait.  My wife got a vegetarian burger that she said was the BEST she ever had and she orders these things all the time.  I got a chicken burger that was also damn good.  The smoothie I created was also delicious.  There is no seating here so pick up a wrap or sandwich and find a nice picnic spot.   I can't wait to come back and try an acai bowl or some breakfast items."}
{"text":"I think I'm bias to healthy food eateries, cuz im giving this place 5 whooping stars.  Actually more like 4.5-4.8? If I was being nit picky, the drive through window is pretty far from the driver's window.  I came last week like around 10am and there was like no one here which was nice.  Ordered drive through, the guy came up to my car to take my order, very friendly and cordial, answered all my questions.  Drove up to the window and waited since they claimed that everything is done fresh and made to order.  Didn't wait too long, went with an original which came in the big plastic cups.  Got mango, pineapple blueberries and some non dairy milk cant remember.  If I can offer up a suggestion, maybe more non dairy yogurt? But all in all, was pleasantly surprised with my early morning treat and will be definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Good place to stop if you want a smoothie on the fly but if you are a juicer like me your better off just making it at home."}
{"text":"Decided to try their famous Acai bowl and was pretty amazed at how delicious it was.  I ordered a regular size and by looking at it, I thought I would not get full from it but it surely filled me up and it certainly curbed my sweet craving.  It's not really a bowl per se, it's served in a cup so the name did fool me.    They have a drive up and a walk up window.  The drive up window is definitely not meant for small cars as the window is high and far...you almost have to climb out of the window to reach the window but its a doable.  They also serve smoothies and sandwiches at a decent price."}
{"text":"Bowl was good, didn't like sitting in the drive thru while the workers blasted some song saying n work,ho..., b work,etc. lovely."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I tried the acai bowl like everyone recommended and it was absolutely delicious. First timers get a large for regular price. Service was absolutely amazing!! I let them know it was my first time there and someone came out and helped me and he was very nice and knowledgable. I pull up to the window and the owner rang me up and he was just so dang nice and friendly. He let me know that they do call ahead orders and they have a website for their menu. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  the service is great and they have delicious juices and fruit snacks.  But I wish they'd open way earlier.  Since theirs plenty of us who prefer a green juice over coffee At 6am.   Otherwise you guys rock"}
{"text":"I got the dragon fruit base! This is the second time I have been here and the service is great and the Acai bowls are amazing!!!! I could go here everyday and it would never get old!"}
{"text":"have had this place many of times before, but wasn't absolutely sold until I tried \"the mean\" the peanut butter flavor is amazing and it's so filling. the service is good, my favorite employee no longer works here. I wish they were open at 8:00 instead of 8:30 so I can grab it as breakfast!"}
{"text":"Simply the best smoothies and bowls in Vegas! This is where I first tried the delicious pitaya fruit. Sweet fruity treats, but not loaded with excess sugar. The customer service is top-notch. A bit pricey but worth the price and the drive. You do get a large portion size so I can justify the price. The bowls are loaded with a smoothie base, fresh fruit, coconut flakes, granola, and honey or agave-soo addicting. Juice 'N' Go beats Tropical Smoothie and Jamba Juice any day (in my opinion)."}
{"text":"Amazing everything!! The service was amazing and they were more than willing to help with any questions. I got a juice with spinach celery pineapple multivitamin and energy and a chicken quesadilla. They gave the quesadilla to me for free because it was kids and I paid for the chicken. They also gave me some chips for free! The food was so amazing and the drink was delicious. New fav spot!"}
{"text":"I work very nearby and basically come here everyday with coworkers. Chris and Matt are both awesome.  Everything that I've tried is delicious. My go to is the Traditional Acai Bowl with extra granola.   Fair warning - sometimes it does take a little while, especially if they're busy because everything is made fresh. But trust me, it is worth the wait!  Stop by if you're looking for an actually healthy smoothie, snack etc.. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The fact that I come here at least once a week if not more speaks for itself. I LOVE IT!!!! The staff & owner is always so nice and they know what to recommend and will make you your own custom bowl, smoothie, or food you want. There isn't many acai bowl or smoothie places on this side of town so this is a little gem to have. It's always fresh and delicious. Love the fact they have the drive thru because let's face it, sometimes you just don't want to get out of the car. Highly recommended it, just make sure you check the hours because they're closed Sundays and close around 6pm."}
{"text":"Omg the #1seller was sooo good and filling with mango n pineapple soo good most deff will b back ;*) lovely staff"}
{"text":"Feel in love with this place! I order a Tropical Pitaya! So delicious and savoring! The location is so cute and different. I love the idea of a fast drive thru that's healthy!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to after a workout by far!  I usually get an acai bowl. SO good and refreshing. You can customize it to your liking. I get it made with coconut milk, agave, mixed berries, mango and extra granola. MMM! I've had their french toast sticks, coconut water with pineapple juice, and my boyfriend always gets a smoothie with protein. All very good.  I like to call in my order so I can avoid the wait. Even if there is a wait I really don't mind it.   The service is pretty awesome here, not only for a drive thru but for any kind of place. Usually when I call in my order they warn me that the granola has nuts in it. I come from a family with nut allergies so that made me appreciate them more. And when I first order my bowl with extra granola I just thought they would throw it on top, but he handed me a little cup with granola and said he thought it would be better this way so I can put it in when I get towards the bottom and it wouldn't be soggy. GENIUS!  I'd come here more often if they were open later. I work banker hours so I miss them during the week, but we'll always have Saturdays together!"}
{"text":"If you have not tried the Acai bowl at Juice 'N' Go you are really missing something yummy! I find myself craving this bowl instead of ice cream! The workers are super friendly & accommodating too! It is a bummer that they are closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I actually rarely eat fruits so for me to be IN LOVE with the Acai bowl is pretty surprising! I've heard many good reviews about this drive thru stand and I thought id check it out since I live down the street.   I swear their Acai bowl is amazing! You can customize your bowl to your liking and it's all for only $7-8. It tastes fresh and the fruit to Acai blend to granola ratio is on point! I'm definitely going to go here more often."}
{"text":"I have driven by this tiny, yet colorful establishment many times while on Rainbow Blvd. I decided to stop by one Saturday and give it a try. Bring your patience, because your order will more than likely take about 10 minutes from ordering to getting it in your hands.  I ordered the Acai bowl which seems to be the hit with other Yelpers. It was very tasty and filling. I would highly recommend it. They offer breakfast items, smoothies, sandwiches to name a few.  My only reason for not giving it a 5 is there is no place to sit/stand safely while you wait for your order as the building is in the middle of the parking lot. I waited in the shade of a nearby building.  People have said to call in, I think I would rather just get there and order- it has a drive thru or a walk up window, whatever floats your boat."}
{"text":"Service could be a little faster- but it's a tiny place so I understand! I got the strawberry and pineapple smoothie blended with mango nectar... YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, the food is great and the staff is amazing! They all greet me by name and have my order memorized.   If you're looking for a great healthy meal look no further this is definitely the place to visit."}
{"text":"Great price, great sizes, taste amazing! (Review for pitaya bowl. Will be coming here often. Oh and a drive thru!? Love it."}
{"text":"It was ok.  Got a pitaya bowl which was alright...nothing out of this world.  A little pricey.  I would recommend getting the small, because I bought a large which was just a lot more pitaya with just a small amount of toppings on top. Recommendation: pick up some frozen pitaya at Sprouts and make your own for a lot, lot less and just as good."}
{"text":"This place is da bomb!!! Always delicious food and juices!! I love their açai bowls! The drive thru does take a lil bit of time :/ but it is best to call in your order in ahead of time! the employees here are so nice, patient and helpful ! Whenever im in the area i always stop by!!"}
{"text":"It was really good. However, the blueberries were soggy and it melted really quick. I wish the acai bowl were in an actual bowl so I don't have to worry about maneuvering the spoon around so the fruit doesn't fall out of the cup.  Even though I think those changes would make a big difference,  I still would eat there.  Customer service was good. I haven't came here before so they guy explained everything to me. Then he walked the food to my car so I don't have to wait in the hot sun."}
{"text":"I have been to Juice 'N' Go on multiple occasions. The first time I came here I tried the acai smoothie and was upgraded to a large because it was my first time. The flavor of the smoothie was spot on but it was not as thick as I would have liked it to be. The second time I tried the acai bowl which is what they are known for. This may be the only place in Las Vegas that has acai bowls. I decided on the mini because it was just a snack. I thought the acai was too runny and I did not like that the majority of the fruit was frozen. In order for this place too be taken to the next level they need to use more fresh fruit."}
{"text":"Seriously addicted I love this place!! I've been coming here for the past 7 months now and wow its amazing. Live the fresh fruit and extra additives like flax seed or b12. Definitely a must for everyone!"}
{"text":"This place had the most watery acai blend i have ever had. It is like i was drinking apple juice with how much they put, not the consistency of a right acai puree that other places give. Blueberries were small and the granola is nothing special. You can do better and so will I. Dont settle for mediocre acai."}
{"text":"I absolutely love going to this little pick me up when I'm on the go. I mainly come for the smoothies because they're always so freakin delicious and their salad is definitely not the nasty cheap iceberg lettuce throw together. Definitely some yummy veggies and a great Greek dressing. However, I did try the acai bowl and didn't love it as much as I thought I would. Granted, the first time I didn't order a sweetener with it so it was a little bland, but I really didn't enjoy the runny texture of it. It might have helped if the acai bowls were in more bowl like containers too instead of these tall cups. Other than that, this place is awesome and worth a try!"}
{"text":"So my wife was in the hospital and wanted an Acai bowl. I was able to fine Juice N Go on Yelp with ease. With all the good reviews it had I set off. When I arrived I was not expecting a drive through style business, but hey I'm always up for an adventure. He menu was clear and concise, which I love. The menu also had a lot of options. My wife was extremely happy with the flavor I got for her and the cost to amount given ratio was great. Would definitely come back if it was closer to our residence. -DMN"}
{"text":"Absolutely obsessed with this place!! I made a yelp account justtt so I could review how amazing this place is! Not only the service is excellent, but the products they provide and choices they have are all so amazing! I've only been once, but will definitely be going back for more! I can't wait to try other things on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I love Juice n Go! Temporarily living in Vegas I've been looking to get away from greasy fast food and looking for healthy alternatives as I am always on the go and Juice n Go has been the perfect go- to spot for me. The give you pretty big portion size that will definitely fill you up! I love that you are able to order ahead of time and the many different options that are available to customize your order. The employees are amazing and always friendly and patient. I also love that kids get to eat for free! I think Juice n Go is amazing and need to expand their locations!"}
{"text":"Love coming here. Everything's so good, fresh and the guys are always nice- usually always a line but thats a good thing-you know it's good! Pitaya bowl is my favorite along with build your own wrap! I'm here usually 2 times a week!"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite acai bowl in town! I order the acai bowl at most establishments that offer it and juice N go remains the best one I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Most of the fruits are organic which is better than most places. I got the acai bowl and it was phenomenal and they upgraded us to large. Definitely going to return! Check them out, super quick and easy place, and great customer service!"}
{"text":"I definitely thought that the price was reasonable compared to some other places. But then they charged me a dollar extra for a little tiny scoop peanut butter. Either stop being stingy or don't charge a dollar extra for a topping.  As for the taste it was good, not the best though."}
{"text":"When I pulled up to the drive thru, I mentioned it was our first time there, so the guy came out to explain the menu. Great! We ordered the acai bowl and smoothie/wrap combo. We tried a turkey wrap with the regular fixings and everything was so ridiculously good! I live all the way in Silverado Ranch area but will probably drive here at least once a week to try other stuff."}
{"text":"I was expecting a business to walk into and when I pulled up and found it was a drive thru, I was surprised but it's great. Easy to order and they offer your basic acai bowls. Their prices are great and bowls taste just as they should. Sadly, I do not live close to this gem and I'm disappointed I can visit it more often."}
{"text":"These smoothies are the tastiest you have had. There is so much variety and the options are endless. They are also rally filling so often when I don't have time for lunch, I'll just a grab a protein smoothie from these guys. They are fast and very polite. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"No reason to close so early when you live in a 24hr city. You are on one of the most traveled streets in Vegas. Each dayThousands upon thousands of cars pass your location every couple of hours and yet you guys still close super early and don't help customers that drive up a few minuets after 6! Not to mention your drive thru sign Is actually broken. Outside looking in you would think that a company like yours that was trying to grow and expand you would get every sale you can and serve every customer possible. Word of mouth is the best form of advertising and you guys just lost this billboard for yourself!"}
{"text":"Juice n Go is a healthy option with natural sugars fresh fruits/nectar for smoothies! This is the #16 strawberry, blueberry, and banana with an orange base. It was very refreshing and not too sweet. Next time I will be sure to come back and get the acai bowl as I heard this shop was known for them :)"}
{"text":"best little find ever... healthy and tasty with a cute little drive through hut! I heart this place and I hope they expand so I can hit em more! like every other day if possible! ;) love."}
{"text":"When I visit from Hollyweird I make sure I come here every time. I looooove the coco-juice blend with strawberry/banana. Real strawberries and bananas with chunks of coconut. The best for those blazing Vegas days! Try it!"}
{"text":"I only come here when I feel like splurging because they're very pricey. The owner is very nice, but I don't like how sometimes I feel like my bowl is not full. :( Their acai bowls are really good. It has everything you want in a snack or a dessert: crunchy, sweet, sour, and refreshing. I just wish it didn't take super long to get your food."}
{"text":"I love healthy simple foods, and this lil joint is my favorite hotspot when I'm around the area.  Acai bowl- simply amazing. Super refreshing on hot summer days, love the way the granola stays crunchy till the end, and talk about filling! I'm certainly no lady when devouring every last drop.  Veggie patty wrap- I'm not a vegetarian, but I'd order this before I order a wrap with a chicken patty. It's has a light crunch from the veggie patty and goes great with the hummus vinaigrette. Add pepper jack cheese and voila, your taste buds explode in pure orgasmic ecstasy. Quite filling as well. Vanilla frozen yogurt- creamy and delicious!  I love this place! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is due to the fact that the wait is pretty long and that it's closed on Sundays (for some reason I ALWAYS crave it on Sundays). Other than that, the staff is friendly and the food is not only delicious, but a great and healthy alternative."}
{"text":"My post work out go to spot on many days. Smoothies, bowls, and drinks! I personally LOVE the pitaya bowl. Sweet, tart, and filling it's like eating a bowl of ice cream but without as much guilt. Not sure about the calories on the bowl though! Smoothies are delicious as well, you can customize your order to your preference, I love that, many alternatives for dairy and sugar for those that need choices.  First thing to know is that its only DRIVE THRU and that's fine by me, Juice-N-Go is definitely more of a quick stop place more than anything.  Customer service is okay, I had an issue where I was overcharged so check your bank accounts or just pay cash to be safe. Still wouldn't stop me from returning.  I appreciate the consistency on the bowls and the fruit has always been fresh, sometimes you have to wait but in my opinion it's worth it considering your bowl is being created just for you. Pitaya bowl is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Juice N Go is so delicious. I've had the Acai bowl, with no coconut (not a fan) and its absolutely to die for. I've also had the wheat quesadilla and a smoothie and both have been extremely yummy. The staff is always super friendly and funny. There is a little bit of a wait, but it's worth it because it's all fresh. The only thing I wish was different about this awesome establishment would be if it was open later. I am a student at UNLV (I hear that a new location may be opening down there) and live on this side of town, but with traffic and everything it takes forever to get up on this side of town. Also, opening earlier on Saturdays would be nice, so I can go before work:)  ANYWAYS, definitely a place to try ! So good:)"}
{"text":"Cool little spot in an unsuspecting business plaza by CSN Charleston Campus!  I've only had the Acai (Ah-Sai-Ee) Bowl and they were nice enough to upgrade me to a large bowl for the price of a regular for my first visit.   I don't know much about acai berries other than its suppose to be some \"superfood\" from South America and is a great antioxidant! I'll take acai berries over prunes any day! I believe they use Sambazon Acai Juice (the expensive purple one at costco) and freeze it then blend it for the base. It comes with 2 fruit toppings (plenty of choices), coconut shavings, honey or agave nectar, and granola. The regular is $6.99 (24oz) and large is $7.99 (32oz). The large could definitely replace a regular person's meal and regular for a smaller appetite. A regular may be more optimal because unless you can guzzle your bowl in 20 minutes or so it starts to turn into a berry soup. Maybe if it was more of a thick smoothie I would like it a bit more.   I have not tried their other options such as frozen yogurt, wraps, or juices but looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This place brings a little piece of California to Las Vegas! By far the best Acai café around! If you are in town you can't leave without grabbing a Acai Bowl!"}
{"text":"I had a hard time finding it because there aren't any signs from the street and it's a stand in the middle of the shopping center but glad I did. Wow!! I am so impressed by the acai bowl. I got a large acai bowl it was a perfect breakfast, fresh and wonderful. I am going to be visiting much more often."}
{"text":"The Acai bowls are the best in Las Vegas! They are fresh and very filling. The Pitaya is just as good! I've also had some of the best wraps from Juice N Go. I suggest the roast beef & hummus on a spinach wrap!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Highly recommend you get the Pitaya bowl... or anything really."}
{"text":"This place was amazeballs! It hit the spot on a hot summer day. My friend Martin just keeps raving about this place so I finally had to see for myself. I ordered their traditional acai bowl regular sized (6.99). It had strawberries, berries, and banana with coconut shavings, granola, and your choice of honey or agave nectar. I did the agave nectar. It satisfied my craving for sure! Delicious in every bite! However, I did expect it to be like a regular acai bowl which is usually thicker in consistency, but it is more runnier. Either way I managed and I enjoyed it anyway.  I also ordered a chicken quesadilla on a wheat tortilla (4.99) since I needed actual food in my stomach as well. That wasn't as great either, and now I know that you'd prefer to order their specialty beverages and smoothies here rather than their food.  Their wait is a bit long, but they were nice enough to forewarn you that everything is made to order so the wait might be a bit longer than most places. So I understood. I was quite happy to hear that we got a free kids smoothie! You get one when you spend more than $10.00. So my little kiddo was pretty ecstatic to hear he got a free treat. How special! I can't wait to go back and try their coconut water."}
{"text":"I first had an acai bowl from Sambazon in Southern California and I fell in love!   My first time here I got a the classic acai bowl and it really hit the spot. It was better than what I had at a few other places in town and the employees are super friendly! It was also a plus that they use sambazon acai purée for their bowls.   Next time I'll try one of their juices and smoothies!"}
{"text":"Best experience here. Quality food and great service. They made us feel very welcome and important. We would definitely be coming to this location. The best go to spot in town for acai and more."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!!!we got there a half hr before they opened and they opened for us and very accommodating. Super friending with amazing aviation bowls, and smoothies! You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious available bowls!!! I absolutely love this place  Juice N Go is the way to go !"}
{"text":"The customer service is excellent ! I let them know it was my first time and what they suggest this wonderful gentleman guided me through my order without a fuss. I absolutely loved it too"}
{"text":"Wow. Fresh, sweet, and absolutely delicious. What a great place for yogurt. The food is tolerable, mostly dry, but the five starts goes to the awesome service and the absolute freshness of everything they use. Their location is horrible, despite being so close to the College of Southern Nevada. Shifty characters and young kids have asked me for money from my car two out of our three visits. But the yogurt is just great, as is the portability and presentation.   The guys working there are awesome. Very friendly and personable each time, also. They don't mind that lengthy reach from window to car, and are pretty quick considering the cramped workplace. I come here everyday before work just to grab a frozen yogurt with fruit and granola, which is insanely inexpensive."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, FRESH!   I love when places use fresh, quality ingredients in whatever they're making... I stopped by to grab a mango-banana smoothie. Initially, I really didn't expect much from this place. I thought -- \"how could a place so small produce good smoothies and acai bowls?\" They proved my initial thought wrong.  The set-up is much like Dutch Bros. Coffee on the Eastside, where you have two options on how to order: walk-up or drive-thru. It may take a little while to get what you ordered, but that's okay because the fruit smoothies and acai bowls are worth the wait! My mango-banana smoothie wasn't made from a flavored powder mix and it wasn't watered down, either. It actually tasted like the fruits I ordered for my smoothie, and that's what I like most about this place -- they give us what Mother Nature intended fruits to taste like.   On a separate occasion, I ordered myself an acai bowl to hold off my midday snack cravings. I ordered the traditional acai bowl, and asked them if they could add mango (upcharge of 99¢), and they gladly accommodated!  The apple juice as a base gave it more of a tart flavor, but it was balanced well with the sweetness of the fruits and honey. The coconut shavings and the crunchy granola gave it a good texture. Overall, their acai bowls are really refreshing and are the perfect thing to snack on when you have down time. I'm not an acai bowl aficionado but from my own judgment, the acai bowl I got here was great!  There's not much going on in the shopping plaza it's located in, but it's definitely worth a try for those fresh fruit fanatics."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually get the regular Acai bowl and ice tea. Great customer service. My last visit I wasn't sure what time they closed and when I realized there was only 5 minutes until closing I said I would come back another day. The lady working there told me to stay and thanked us for our business. Excellent food and customer service."}
{"text":"Place is good but my complains are they run out of ingredients and they are inconsistent with their drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Fresh healthy juices on the go and everyone is always so nice when I go there."}
{"text":"I cant say enough about how cool this place is...I always call ahead for my lunch break and they always mange to throw in some kinda complimentary chips or tea..just makes you feel so welcomed and appreciated. The owner is very nice (and cute) and he always greets you with a smile. Kudos yall;)"}
{"text":"The name of this place is a lot more literal than I could have imagined. You really just drive up and get your drink from a super small trailer looking place, but it was cute.  After some rock climbing, my friend and I wanted something on the healthier side so we opted for the acai bowl. It was our first time trying one and I was super satisfied. This thing was delicious! We got a legs to share, which got really hard to do in the car. It was huge. It was basically the size of to-go pho. I can't wait to come back here and try their other stuff.  The guy at the window was really nice. They were very patient and didn't rush us when it took awhile to decide. I also awkwardly dropped my coins but he said he would just pick them up, which was nice since that was low-key embarrassing."}
{"text":"Everywhere I turn in Las Vegas a healthy alternative is popping up. This one here is a delight. The staff is beyond friendly and accommodating. Being it was my first time here they really took care of us. As I walked up to the window they handed me some organic vanilla frozen yogurt just for coming to the establishment which I thought was pretty cool. I ordered a Veggie wrap with a Sun Dried Tomato tortilla, hummus spread, a dash of horseradish, w/ field greens and a black bean veggie patty!!! As Guy Fieri would say this thing is out of bounds!!! I also ordered a Acai bowl to take home for later, Yeah that didn't happen... I ate that immediately! It was too good!!! On top of all that, as I was leaving Juice~N~Go they thanked me gracefully by giving me a complimentary passion fruit iced tea to show their gratitude. I've recommended this little stand to about 6 of my friends and they have all had nothing but good things to say."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places if I wanna eat/drink healthy on the go. Quick service. Is a drive through, not a restaurant. Super cheap. Love their açaí choices. Perfect for breakfast. You can also call in your order."}
{"text":"I have to give 5! They always give a lot more in their Acai bowls and today upgraded me to a large for the price of a small. The guy at the window was nice and patient when I ordered. He said he just wants to thank the customers for supporting the biz. The food itself is always fresh and yummy. Mangoes could be sweeter but they can't control that anymore than the grocery stores lol. Try them out, be a regular and they'll hook it up :)"}
{"text":"Brought some friends in to show them how amazing the bowls are here! & as always, it was beyond fantastic! &  Amazing customer service!  Always happy to oblige my picky needs.   Phillip is an outstanding crew member & is real keeper, guys!  Keep up the positive energy & good work!    I'll be sure to bring more friends & spread the word :)"}
{"text":"love love love this place.   They have the best healthy snacks, and the acai bowl is to die for.   Everything is fresh, and tastes so good!"}
{"text":"Acai is a berry that grows in the Brazilian Rain Forest.  About five years ago our pediatric Naturapathic doctor recommended Sambazon Acai to incorporate into my kids diets.  This is a powerful antioxidant that reduces inflammation.    Sambazon makes a freeze dried acai powder that I always have in my fridge and I add it to yogurt and smoothies at home.  So, when I heard of Acai Bowls at local places around town, I was determined to see if what they offered was better than what I make at home.  I have driven by this place many times so finally today I went to the drive-thru.  The wait was like 20 minutes. But the staff did come out and apologize and offered a student discount...since I'm not a student I did get a military discount of 10 percent off the $6.99 small \"bowl\".  You pick your own fruit and it was a long list of great tropical fruits to choose from so I picked berries, coconut and honey.  Granola and frozen Acai was added.  For me I wasn't crazy about the icy cold acai, I guess because I compare it to my own home version where I use yogurt.   There are other smoothie drinks to choose from and you really have to be creative because you have to put it together by choosing all the ingredients yourself.  If the wait wasn't so long I would consider coming back to try out other items.   Overall I'm happy there are places out there offering alternative healthy options."}
{"text":"Came to see what the hype was about and I was so disappointed. I love acai bowls and Juice and Go's was not good... it was waaaaay too icy not how normal acai bowls are. The acai blend part had absolutely no flavor to it. I could barely taste the fruits mixed in with it. One of the blueberries I had in my bowl still had a little hard stem on it. I was soo disappointed and upset that I spent about $10 on something I didn't enjoy...  I do not recommend.."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Even though they can't split the large bowl, the guy was so nice and gave me an empty container to go. I love #7"}
{"text":"Wow !! Good good good !! Fresh a delicious. Worth the drive there and get acai bowl there !! They have drive thru too !! 1st time for me to try this shop but I already love this place ! I got 1st one which is blueberry banana strawberries coconut with honey on top ! So yummyyyy !!!"}
{"text":"If I ever have a kid I would want it grow up like Juice 'n' Go.  Fun, customizable, healthy, low maintenance, and bad ass.  \"Lol what?  You want to order off the kids menu?  That's cute. No, you're having a bowl too.\"  My go to item is their Traditional [Coconut Shaving, Strawberries, Blueberries, Banana, and Granola (Granola have Almonds for those with allergies)] 1/2 Acai Bowl, 1/2 Pitaya Bowl with Whey Protein and no extra sweetener.  The bowls are loaded with natural sugar, so you don't need any extra calories from simple sugar/agave.    Acaí is rich in antioxidants, so by adding Pitaya (Dragon Fruit) not only thicken the bowl but it also upsurge your fiber intake.  And it's freaking delicious too.  For a large bowl its roughly about ~400cal according to their math they did on the spot.  Trim it down more by subbing Coconut Water instead of Apple Juice (organic) as the base, or even omitting the Frozen Yogurt.    They proudly use Sambazon.  Call in your order to avoid 10-15min wait as each are built to order."}
{"text":"Juice N Go is not in an area I am in very often... but I decided I wanted to try something new for lunch, and I had seen a few friends post glowing reviews for Juice N Go, so I decided to  made the 15 minute drive over to pick up an acai bowl.   I called my order in to avoid waiting, and sure enough, my order was ready when I arrived. The employee that helped me was super friendly too.   Everything here is made fresh to order, so you WILL wait if you do not call your order in. You can't have your cake and eat it too, if you are impatient and don't want to wait, order ahead.   I got a regular acai bowl with bananas and blueberries, made with soy milk. (Actually, I got two, my  co-worker wanted to give it a try as well).  It was delicious, my only complaint is that it was a little runnier than I would like, but that may have been due to driving 15 minutes before eating it. It was also surprisingly filling!   Remember folks, patience is a virtue... Call your order in and avoid having to wait!"}
{"text":"Love the acai bowl! You definitely get your moneys worth. The staff is very friendly. I ordered my acai bowl in advance and when I came to pick it up, they upgraded my acai bowl to a large. No extra charge! I would def go here again =D"}
{"text":"Their Acai bowls are so refreshing and delicious! I find myself craving their acai bowls in the middle of the day. I can't get enough. The workers are very friendly, but there can be a bit of a wait depending on what part of the day it is. I just wish the acai bowls weren't so pricey!"}
{"text":"The banana strawberry smoothie were very good and the service was fast and extremely friendly"}
{"text":"For 10 bucks you get a smoothie and a sandwich fast friendly service for when you're on-the-go and in need of a healthy alternative... definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"Amazed by how fresh the ingredients were. The guy who took our order was super nice, explained the menu, free upgrade for our first time. Free dog treat for the dog."}
{"text":"I happened to go on National Acai Day!  WOOHOO!  The owner was really friendly and informative.  I can tell he really loves what he's selling.  So we tried the Acai bowl and a mango/carrot juice.  We loved both!  I'm actually craving the Acai bowl - highly recommended.  Delicious, fresh, awesome goodness. I LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Always happy with the acai bowls! I have celiac disease so I can't eat any of the sandwiches or wraps but I'm happy with the bowls and never have a reaction. They even have gluten free granola which is amazing. Fresh fruit and not too sweet like jamba's. I come almost everyday (:"}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago my brother, who lives in San Diego, told me he was going to get an Acia Bowl.  Never hearing of an Acai Bowl, the foodie in me asked him what it was.  That conversation changed my life.  After feeling very excited and anxious to try a bowl,  I was leery and wondered if I could actually find such healthy goodness in Las Vegas.  It seems as if many of our favorite healthy food places don't last long here in the valley.  After Googling, Yelping and searching high and low for a place to find a good Acia Bowl I found Juice 'N' Go.  It wasn't close to the house but beggars can't be choosers.  The next day we set out for Rainbow to try this bowl that my brother swore by.  My husband and I got different variations of the Acia Bowls.  It took awhile to get our order but we didn't care because this food is fresh people, and made to order.  After one bite, we were hooked.  The fruit is delicious and fresh and PRETTY, the value is phenomenal and the people that work there are so freaking nice and friendly.  Juice 'N' Go Acia Bowls have become a part of our lives on a weekly basis and sometimes more.  We've had bowls for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  We dream of that yummy goodness and have withdrawals if too much time lapses between visits.  Oh, and we've also tried the chicken salad, bagels and smoothies.  Everything is awesome!    Please go.  Please.  I beg."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things are smoothies, and I am so glad I found this place. Its really far from where I live, but at least i know where its at so when Im in the area I can stop by. I love that you can make your own smoothie, pick your ingredients and it tastes delicious! I haven't tried the acai bowls because I can't have dairy, but they do look delicious. The guys were extremely nice and even gave a treat to my dog in the car with me. I love that they have drive-thru because sometimes you just don't want to get out of your car. I love this place, I wish there was one in Henderson! Oh and Kids eat free when you purchase $10 or more of food and trust me you will want to order $10 plus worth of food/drinks. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The first two visits may have been a bust in terms of wait times and customer service, but since then I've had only 5 star experiences!  This place is within close proximity to my school, so driving off campus for a healthier alternative is incredibly easy, and I never have to feel guilty about how often I'm here. Light, fresh, organic superfood. I'm all about it!  Wait times still run just a bit long- but I'd say anywhere from 5-10 min.. Not the 30min I had previously experienced.. And not any longer than a Tropical Smoothie drive-thru. The customer service here has been fantastic! Very personable, willing to make suggestions and super friendly.  They also have a pitaya bowl that isn't listed on the menu, but it's advertised at the pick-up window. It should be noted that the acai bowl melts really quickly, whereas the pitaya bowl holds up incredibly well. If I'm taking this into work with me, I grab the pitaya, which should still be eaten within the hour."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try my first acai bowl in Vegas.. But it was the most disgusting, nastiest thing I ever tasted. It seemed pre made and tasted like water. Acai bowls are suppose to be a nice pasty consistence.. This was pretty much purple water. I recommend they try banzai bowl in California and learn how to make an actually acai bowl, because this was literally crap. I would give them 0 stars if I could"}
{"text":"came here for the first time today after reading the reviews for best acai bowl in Vegas. never tried acai bowl before so it was double first time! I got the traditional acai bowl and I have to say it was quite delicious! I will be having it again for sure."}
{"text":"Love it here. Getting my normal order. Acai bowl with the traditional toppings but made with coconut milk. And a large lemon lime aide. Holla"}
{"text":"I usually get either the Acai Bowl or the Strawberry Cheesecake one but recently I have been liking the Mango, Spinach, and Kale smoothies/bowl and not only is it healthy but also super delicious. I am not much of a healthy person and was kind of hesitant to try it but you can barely taste the kale and spinach which is a great plus for me. Its just sweet enough with the mango. I also love their sandwiches and wraps with the Italian Vinaigrette. I have had some from other places but I feel as if those ones can't compare to theirs. Prices are reasonable for the quality I get and the wait is definitely worth it. They are a drive-thru but they have a walk-up window. I would recommend calling in your order to skip or reduce the time you wait in line :)"}
{"text":"So yummy! My new favorite place to have lunch. I had the veggie hummus wrap with a salad and it was delicious! The staff was also super sweet. Very healthy with lots of flavor. Can't wait to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"It was very tasty, not ideal to eat on the go.  I asked for extra granola.... didn't seem any extra than the person who didn't ask for it.  I personally would prefer more toppings because you go through them pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Been on an acai bowl kick recently so when we were in town for MDW, found this place on Yelp and had to give it a try.   Location: It's a bit of a strange set up in the middle of a shopping center parking lot with a walk up window or drive-thru option.  We opted for the drive-thru since we were going to eat in the car anyway. (No seating)  Service: EXCELLENT! We ordered a large acai bowl and an iced green tea, but the guy said they just got rid of their green tea and suggested their tropical one instead.  Ordered it and thought nothing of it. Pulled up to the window and got our stuff, but the guy said he charged me a regular and gave us the tea at no charge!!! Said he was sorry they didn't have the green tea. Totally didn't have to do that but just shows the kind of business they run and how they care about their customers.   Bowl: Definitely tasty and filling although a bit more watery than I like. Was almost a smoothie with granola, bananas and strawberry on top.   Summary: Very friendly service and pretty darn good acai bowl.  Would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great customer service!!! First time here and  the lady went over the menu with me. She recommended her favorite smoothie which was the chocolate, peanut butter and banana smoothie with coconut milk... Before I left she had me try it to make sure I liked it..!! Awesome place and will recommend to others!!!"}
{"text":"Acai bowl was amazing, flavors were on point! Only mishap I had was the cup was filled to the top I couldn't get my spoon in. Then I spilled it all over ha ha oh well, I'll still come back."}
{"text":"How disappointing!  After a morning hike through Fletcher Canyon, an acai bowl on my way back to the strip sounded like the perfect plan. I was super excited to find nearby Juice'N'Go - over 4 stars and super close to my hotel? Amazing!  Juice'N'Go is drive thru/car service only. The employee at the window was very nice, and I took his recommendation of the traditional acai bowl. They have a promotion for 1st timers - free upgrade to a large, nice! Once ordered and paid, I was instructed to pull around to their side stairs where another employee promptly brought out my bowl to my car.  The bowl looked great. They have great packaging, including a labeled cup, lid, spoon, and napkins.  Too bad the flavors didn't stand up though - it definitely looked better than it tasted! The acai blend was so watery and melted to a drippy juice consistency in under 5 minutes. Though the toppings were plenty, the banana slices were so tart and unripe. I ended up throwing away about half of the bowl because it became so unappetizing.   Juice'N'Go was sadly one of my worst acai bowls ever - Yelp totally got it wrong this time. With their proximity to the strip, I would have happily made this a regular stop on my LV trips had it been good. Hopefully they can work on their quality."}
{"text":"I love this place, fresh ingredients and friendly staff. I'm here a couple times a week. It's a great, healthy way to start my day. I go with the bowls, I've tried just about every one of them, the colada is great but the new school is my favorite. Much better choice than a greasy mcgriddle!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and I love how convenient the drive thru is. I never wait too long and my order is always correct and delicious!"}
{"text":"My first time coming here, there was only one person working and I can understand why it was so slow but the worker kept it honest and tried to a accommodate as best as possible. I ordered the #1 bowl and I honestly thought it was really good but the actual acai mix was runny instead of nice consistency that I am normal accustomed to with acai bowls. It would have been an easy 5/5 if there were more people staffed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Las Vegas, Juice n go is its own hidden gem. I have never been disappointed with the quality of food. The fruit is fresh and talking to the owner once, he told me that it is all shipped the day of. Being health conscious, I loved hearing that they took quality of fresh food to heart. I always get the traditional acai bowl with no coconut shavings and agave syrup. I also add kiwi for .49 cents. The wait is a little longer than a typical drive thru but that is because everything is made fresh upon order. Great business!"}
{"text":"I have only had their Acai Bowls. They have sandwiches, wraps, and salads but I have yet to try any of them because I'm usually in a hurry. (just down the street from school and is my usual stop if I'm feeling like I need a healthy 'pick me up' before I hit the books)  The Acai Bowl is amazing. It's sort of got a slushy-like consistency to it and you can choose what to blend it with (coconut milk, apple juice, soy milk). They top it off with berries and bananas (plus whatever fruit you want to add to it), organic granola, coconut shavings, and some kind of sweetener. I always just get honey (but there's also agave) I've only ever ordered a 'regular' sized bowl because the large just looks WAY too big for me and the 'regular' already gets me pretty full.   I've seen on other people's reviews that the acai slush isn't sweet enough but c'mon people, its natural and it isn't pumped with preservatives and additives. I would hate for it to be too sweet. I think it's perfect the way it is, but that's just my take on it. Also, I've heard that there can be a bit of a wait but I don't think i've ever waited for more than 5-10 minutes, so maybe I just beat the crowd? or am there before? Either way, no complaints here!  The dudes who take my order and prepare my bowls are ALWAYS so accommodating and helpful. First time there, they explained to me the whole process so by the second, third, etc, etc, time, I never felt overwhelmed. Also, I LOVE the fact that kids eat free (with the purchase of an 'adult' item) I haven't taken my little guy yet, but I love that I have another healthy option for him!"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times and loved it!  It is a order and go, so don't expect to sit and dine in.    I got the traditional acai bowl in large 2x and traditional Acai Smoothie in large, basically the same but I could drink the other and it was very satisfying x3. Definetly going back, just wish there were more locations (won't deduct a star for that cuz I'll still drive there to get an order) :)   *Dear Juice n Go Owner, Please open a Juice n Go in the Mountains Edge area please? With coconut shavings on top.... :-)   Sincerely, Acai Bowl/Smoothie Lover"}
{"text":"On our drive across the country we stopped by Vegas to go climbing. We looked for a place for a yummy breakfast and this became our favourite!! Delicious fresh and healthy food and great service!!"}
{"text":"Okay juice N go is literally juice and go. It is only a drive through so don't expect to sit in. But their Acai bowl is one of the best things I've gotten from a drive through window.   Pros:  - Acai bowl = great bowl of fire!!  - Reasonably priced  - Really nice staff  - I don't feel fat eating here   Cons:  -The drive thru is a bit tight  -There is only one location that I know of. Expand please :) like southwest side pleeeeease?"}
{"text":"Awesome acai bowls. As a cheesecake lover, I was pleasantly surprised to try their cheesecake flavored Acai bowl. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple of days ago and they were only doing drive-thru's, which was kind of weird to me.   I ordered the traditional Acai bowl. They were out of bananas so I got mango instead. Some of the fresh fruit toppings were really sour but it was still delicious!   They were a bit busy and it took them a while to take my order but it was alright. I ordered a regular but the guy gave me a large. I think they did that cos I was waiting for a while. Good customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  There isn't much going on in the shopping center it is in and there doesn't seem like there is much to this little stand but everything I have tried has been great.   I especially love the bowls with pitaya aka dragon fruit. I have tried a number of smoothies as well and they all are great."}
{"text":"Really loved this place! You can customize your whole order and I really liked that. I had a whole wheat wrap with chicken, grilled onions and bell peppers with spinach, tomatoes, ranch and pepper jack cheese. So yummy! I also ordered a smoothie and it was delicious! I tried the strawberry/banana with acai and soy milk. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I got a carrot, spinach and strawberry smoothie.  Nothing special.  It's something that I can make at home.  I guess I was hoping for a better flavor or even texture.  I'm actually gonna give this place a try again and maybe order something different.  If it's better the 2nd time around, I'll change my review."}
{"text":"Acai sorbet with honey, granola, strawberries, bananas, chocolate chips and coconut is our favorite!  We love it!  Must have at least twice a week!  The only thing I wish is that they had more drive thru locations and that they had a loyalty program!  But I do give 5 stars for their deliciousness!"}
{"text":"This place has HANDS DOWN the greatest smoothie bowls in ALL of vegas I absolutely love this place, I live on the opposite side of town but the trip is so so worth it."}
{"text":"It's 4minutes away...everything fresh and full of yumminess. ....these are what my sons eat! I love the juices and wraps...those are my favs!  The reason for 4 stars is because of the drive thru is pretty high but worth the price...  U get ur moneys worth!"}
{"text":"The menu is enormous with different fruit, protein, bread and spread options. The menu varies from their Acai bowls to their fresh wraps. I will eventually try all of their items. I always enjoy a nice fresh acai bowl and this was the nearest place with good reviews. The place is great for express service. The menu was very clear and the person taking my order mentioned all the preparation options for their acai bowl; traditional, coconut milk, and soy milk. They made sure to offer it before starting my order. I didn't wait long for my order. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"MMM MMM GOOD~!!!  Finally tried some Juice 'N' Go and I couldn't have chose a better day than National Acai Day haha Half off Acai Bowls..? YES, please ;]]]   I love how they have a drive-thru so it's fast and convenient.. Everything is made to order and fresh so you don't want to come here if you are in a rush.. There was only 1 car ahead of me so I was in and out in about just a little over 10 minutes but I can see how during peak times the wait could be long.  The chef (or owner) greeted me through the intercom but came out to take my order which was nice. He was super friendly and upbeat. I got the large Acai bowl (normally $7.99)  with coconut milk, banana, mixed berries, coconut shavings, granola & honey~ That thing is HUGE.. like the size of a large soup to-go container haha It was delicious! Some of the fruit were frozen and some fresh so if you have sensitive teeth it may be too cold for you but if you let it sit a while you should be good to go~ The best way I can describe it is it's kind of like an acai/yogurt smoothie with fruits and granola haha I can't wait to come back and try all the other delicious sounding items on the menu. The chef told me they are the greenest restaurant in Las Vegas so they don't use any paper products even paper to-go menus. They also have a walk up window and plan on soon building a little out door dining area. Juice 'N' Go makes eating healthy fast, convenient & easy.. Definitely check this place out ;]]]   HOT TIP: Phone in your order if you don't have time to wait 242-JUICE and don't forget to tip them (beer money) haha"}
{"text":"OMG YUMMY!! Where has this place been my whole life??? I ordered 4 random bowls and put them in the freezer to take with me over 2 work days! Perfect filling and good for you! Plus with hot summertime here, these are icey cold!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always so welcoming and quick with your order! I love coming here every time! Acai bowl is really delicious!"}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful! It's made fresh with fresh ingredients! It tastes fantastic! I wish there were more places like this. I have to admit, I was frustrated with this place at first because of the slow service, it takes forever to get your food since it's freshly made to order. I highly recommend calling in your order. This isn't a good place to order from if you are in a rush, I have learned this the hard way. But if you have a little time, it is well worth it, it is healthy & muy delicioso!! The acai bowls are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. My boyfriend and I went here at the wrong time because the day we went they happened to be short staffed. But in the end it went in our favor. The worker took our order and apologized to us saying it may take awhile to get ready. We weren't in a rush so we were willing to wait since it was our first time trying out an Acai Bowl.   We ordered a Large Acai Bowl ($7.99) and the worker said he would give it to us for the regular price ($6.99) since it was our first time. Turns out it took about 20+ mins to finally get our order. But in the end he gave us 2 Large Acai Bowls for free :)  Lets just say my boyfriend and I were stoked!!! And the Acai Bowls were even more AMAZING!!!! Best thing I've ever had in such a long time! It was refreshing and just the thing I wanted on a hot Vegas day!!!  I want to give a big, \"THANK YOU!\" to the sweet workers here :) Keep up what you guys are doing!!!"}
{"text":"Got to this little box on the corner of a shopping plaza at around 3pm on a Wednesday afternoon. No long lines as mentioned in the other reviews. However we have made attempts before and the line gets pretty ridiculous for an establishment where you can either drive up or walk up to the window for your order. You can call in your order too but I wouldn't do that the yogurt melts pretty fast. The other reviews talked about how long it takes, I think it's well worth the wait, I think they only slice up the fruits when it is ordered hence the uber freshness . I don't think they are pre sliced and sitting in a tub wilting.  My 8 year old daughter placed her order first and ordered the breakfast parfait. The guy helping us told us that it would be too much for her since it was 20 oz and that we could order her  a similar item on the kids menu. Wow! Honesty so rare now a days that breakfast parfait was about $6 and the kids menu is 1.99. The kids items are the same size as Jamba Juice's kids items but WAAAaaaaaay cheaper. So she ordered a kid's yogurt and customized it with strawberries bananas and granola. I got the regular size yogurt customized it with strawberries, bananas, mango, granola and peanut butter. My boyfriend got the famous Acai bowl and my son got the kids' chocolate smoothie. All that for $14 we got the smoothie for free for no reason Yay!  The yogurt was not dense and tart like most yogurt. It was sweet and very ice cream like. The fruits were all firm and tasty, I don't know what brand granola or peanut butter they use but it was super delish and very different from anything I've tasted. I love that you can customize your bowls and that they have lots to chose from. I added peanut butter as an afterthought and while I was waiting I was worried how the mango and peanut butter would taste mixed together. I was also worried when I saw that the peanut butter was not blended with the yogurt it was placed on top.  We are regulars at Jamba Juice and yogurtland  and it takes us awhile to consume our yogurt bowls and smoothies but with Juice n Go items, we went through it pretty quick. My son killed his smoothie just from the walk from their window to our car. We were all done within our treats in less than 5 mins. Take a look around the parking lot and you see everyone leaning on their vehicle handling their yogurt/ fruit bowls ."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place. When I finally got to try it, I ordered a large Acai bowl. It was kind of expensive for the amount ($8) and the acai bowl slowly melted to just become a juice. It was definitely delicious though it didn't fill me up as much as i hope it would've."}
{"text":"My go to spot for giant acai bowls.  Tons off additives available to choose from.  Quick and easy drive thru.  I love this place"}
{"text":"It's a drive true with an edge, the guys are very clever and they try really hard. I genuinely hope that this will become a healthy chain. The fruit they use is fresh and very good. I'm happy I found it."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I got a regular acai bowl for breakfast... It was perfect! Not too sweet and sweet enough... :) a yummy healthy way to start the day! They are super nice there too... It's just a drive through but very personalized!"}
{"text":"Ahhh. I don't know where to start. I've been constantly coming here for the past two years, and each time I come here, it's just as good as the first time. The bowls will fill you up. The acai bowl is what they're known for. It truly is the best in town. I definitely suggest the traditional for a first timer.   I highly recommend the Pitaya bowl. I'm telling you.. it's just HOT PINK goodness. If you're truly indecisive of what to get, I definitely recommend half acai/half pitaya bowl. They make their entire menu to the best quality. Prices are reasonable, healthy is not so cheap nowadays.  The customer service is top-of-the-line. They've thrown a few discounts and samples here and there. On one of my visits, it was a windy out. I found a piece of animal hair on top of my bowl. I did return it and they did not hesitate to make a new one. They also gave me a free bowl for my following visit. I'm a winner.  Thank goodness they extended their hours 'til 8pm. I will continue to come her every so often. Juice 'N' Go is a must."}
{"text":"I drive by this place on my way to work and I drive by on the way home and they are always CLOSED!!  Ugg!!  I absolutely love their acai bowls so, so delicious!!  But because their hours are  so restrictive I have only been able to go twice.  Pls, have either earlier are later hours!  You guys are so great but I never have time to stop by."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh ingredients! I always stop here after a long day of school or work on the way home! I usually get the build your own smoothie with strawberries bananas white chocolate chips and almond milk... so good!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my last experience has really changed my mind about returning to this business. I was an incredibly loyal customer but now I will not be going back.     I was encouraged by their employees to download their Epoxy app. which acts as a stamp card giving you credit for purchases and then leads up to them offering you a free purchase once all of the required amount of stamps are collected.     Today I purchased a large acai bowl with mixed nuts (which is an extra charge), I large smoothie with a .99 additional ingredient, a bagel and cream cheese and a child's smoothie and peanut butter sandwich. It is advertised that kids eat free always with full purchases and that is very generous. However, I paid full price for all my other items which came out to over $20. When I presented the stamp card I was told I am not entitled to a stamp for any of my purchases due to the child's meal being \"on the house\" and that I can't receive \"two offers at once\". I was not redeeming my stamp card, I was simply requesting a stamp for the purchases I paid full price for. Also, I was never informed nor is it posted anywhere that I will not receive a stamp if kid's items are part of my purchase. Also, the \"kids eat free\" is permanently on the menu so I don't understand how that's a special offer.   When talking to the owner regarding the situation he told me \"I'm the only one in town who is this generous.. This is as good as it gets.\" I was really shocked at his attitude. I have brought him business, referred so many of my friends, written positive reviews in the past and gone out of my way to check in on social media.    If you are going to have a loyalty card program... Shouldn't you be rewarding those customers who are in fact, LOYAL? I wasn't asking for anything special.. Merely a stamp on a virtual card for items I paid full price for. If you have limitations- post them clearly, verbalize them to your customers and please don't allow your ego to destroy a great customer relationship. I regret to say I won't be back. This loyal customer apparently isn't worth a .60 stamp."}
{"text":"Fresh, organic ingredients in customizable, made to order bowl cups, the bright yellow booth was worth a 6 mile drive from the Strip.  But it really is Juice N Go... with no tables or chairs it's certainly not Juice N Here."}
{"text":"I've been watching the reviews since my last visit and they seem to be going downhill. I was very disappointed in my food on the last visit. Three food items had hair or cotton towel fibers in them and were not eaten. I will not be back but I'm hoping that they start responding to their reviews and pay attention to the declining quality."}
{"text":"The ONLY Place I go to for an açai bowl. I have had açai bowls all over the state of California and here in Las Vegas and none can't even come close to what Juice N Go provides. Their ingredients are extremely fresh! The fruit has a perfect balance of tart and sweet and the granola and honey give it a perfect balance from the tartness of the açai. I have never tasted and I sable so delicious and perfectly balanced in flavor. The staff is amazing and friendly. I eat here at least three times a week and I am never disappointed. Every time I have ordered my açai bowl it either tastes the same or somehow managed to make it taste better than the last. My only recommendation for people is to call in advance and order ahead, since the name is Juice N Go it's about going through the drive-through to pick up your Organic açai bowl. Other than that thank you for making my days so great and feeding me Juice N Go!"}
{"text":"Love this place! However, I recommend ordering in advance since they do get a bit busy and takes them roughly about 10 min to make an order, which I understand since you can tell the quality of their food is fresh and made to order. Customer service is always an A+"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  Kids eat free after spending 9.99 which isn't hard at all. Best drive thru! Wonderful healthy place to get a meal and smoothie"}
{"text":"Close by the house and huge portions of acai in every bowl. I really did enjoy it and maybe next time I will ask for more agave syrup. The service is slow though so if I were you call it in. Only downfall of this place is it's very small, no where to sit, and slow service. I heard the burgers are good and I am very picky of veggie patties so next time I will try it.  TIP: Spend a $1 more for large acai bowl it's worth it."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the acai bowl I got and the whole experience. I like acai bowls but not from this place. I doubt I'll come back.  I roll down my window to place my order at the second window because their speaker wasn't working. The drive through window was awkwardly high. I drive an SAV and the window was still too high. You'd need to drive a semi. A strong smell of grease was in the air. I'm not sure if it's coming from the pupusas place next door but it was 8:30am and the pupusas place wasn't open yet.  I got the Traditional Acai Bowl with pineapples and protein. I asked if the pineapples were fresh or from a can and what kind of protein they use. The pineapples are frozen and shipped from California. The protein powder is flavorless because it sells more. Each topping/add-on is $1 extra.   The service was pleasant. I was told they took a $1 off my purchase but didn't tell me why. I was the first customer of the day but had to wait at least 15 minutes for my order.  My acai bowl was very soupy I couldn't eat it in my car without making a mess. I had to use a straw and then scoop up the granola and fruits with a spoon. The granola was soggy and overall, the flavor was lacking."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Juice 'N' Go the other day and I gotta say, this place is hard to miss due to the bright colors of its building compared to their neighbors. It's a pretty small place, in fact, I think they could even turn this into a food truck deal if they didn't want to have an actual location.   They have a drive thru area as well as a walk up area. I actually didn't notice their drive thru so I went ahead and walked up instead. They have a pretty good amount of items on their menus ranging from wraps to smoothies to, of course, their famous acai bowl that everyone rages about.   So since their most known item is the acai bowl then that is what I ordered. I decided to go with a regular sized acai bowl. The guy that took my order down asked me if I had wanted a traditional acai bowl. I wasn't really sure what he meant ... so I asked. He said that I could customize it with what I liked. I didn't really know that I had the utmost freedom until I read the reviews more closely AFTER my visit so instead, I subbed two items.   Their traditional bowl had bananas, strawberries, blueberries, honey, and coconut shavings topped with honey I believe. So instead of the bananas and coconut shavings, I wanted mangos and raspberry. Then on top of that, because I was a first time customer, they upgraded my regular to a large -- which was very generous of them.   The wait was ... sort of long for something that doesn't typically take a long time to make. Then again I've never made these types of things so I actually wouldn't really know. But they also had some drive thrus coming through so maybe it was that too...  And he came out with a traditional acai bowl. Huh? Haha he said that his mind sometimes is too busy and completely forgets. So he made a traditional acai bowl instead of the customized one I had ordered. He gave us the traditional one on top of re-making my order so I walked away with two large acai bowls! It was my lucky day!   Anyways, though maybe because I didn't want the bananas, my acai bowl didn't look as filled as the original. And the blueberries were missing :( Or perhaps because I got two that he didn't fill up my bowl? Who knows.   The flavors of the acai were a little bland than what I expected it to be. Granted I'm not very familiar with the acai flavor but the one in the bowl was sort of ... watery. It was runny as well. Perhaps they need to put more frozen yogurt to thicken it up? I love the granola mix in it though. It goes very well with the fruit. The bowl wasn't really sweet either which is a plus -- it was very refreshing and can be really filling too. My boyfriend didn't want to have any so I got stuck with a whole bowl on my own ;(  So it may have been average at most for me but the service is amazing from what I have experienced so far. Can be a bit slow but eh, I had time. I definitely do want to go back to try more things and perhaps try another bowl and this time, I'll be a little smarter on the ordering :)"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! I wish they had a Juice 'N' Go in the Henderson area! It looks like one of those places where you would go to get your smog check for your car or something but besides that, you gotta love this place!  I came here (twice in one day) and ordered their acai bowl. (Pronounced: ahh-sah-ee) One for lunch time and I had to come back to get another for my after-work-snack! I made mine the traditional way and added strawberries, bananas and blue berries. Their organic granola and coconut shavings is what made the acai bowl.   The workers are always friendly and pretty fast.   I am definitely coming back to try some of their other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's kind of hidden in a little shopping center off Rainbow and Oakey, and was previously a tiny drive-thru Baskin Robbins.   So the first time I went with my brother, the staff was super nice and chill! We had walked up to the drive thru menu, and one of the employees walked out to meet us and let us know the low down on what was good (and walked us to the side window where no cars pass through because he's super nice!). I got an acai bowl, which you have the option of putting 3 fruits, either honey or agave nectar, and apple juice, coconut water among other possible juices. I picked mixed berries, peaches, and banana with honey and apple juice, and was not disappointed! I also got a chicken quesadilla with the spinach tortilla because I was sooo famished, and it was nothing short of delicioso. The staff really took the time to let us know what everything was and gave us their personal recommendations, and at the end they gave us a discount and upgraded our acai bowl sizes to Large and gave us free iced tea!  Needless to say, this place is amazing! Fresh ingredients and really friendly staff. The only downside is I wish this place was bigger...was closer to Summerlin....had tables...and had free wifi lol, this would be an awesome study place haha"}
{"text":"Still my favorite acai bowl place out of all the ones I've tried. They have the most fresh & refreshing tasting bowls. Some places add too much stuff to the acai smoothie itself & it just doesn't taste right. I typically get acai bowls with almond milk, & mixed berries, mangoes, & a scoop of almond butter as toppings. Mmmm! Perfect breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went the first day we were in town, and it was so good we went back the next day. Their Acai bowl is the perfect compliment to the Vegas heat and loaded with antioxidants. Topped with fresh fruit, it is a must try!"}
{"text":"The fruit is so fresh this is my favorite spot to stop and grab some yogurt açai berry banana as it has all your good needs for a quick pick me up snack"}
{"text":"Juice 'N' Go was the beginning of the açaí bowl craze in Las Vegas. They first started off with cup and now traded it into a bowl. I feel it was a great change to be able to eat the fruits and açaí together.   I usually get the original with coconut or almond milk. Then granola reminds me of rice crispies and wish they didn't melt so fast when you don't eat it fast enough to get the crunch. I used to love getting their sorbet since it didn't melt as fast, but they took it off the menu.   I have tried their customize your own wrap and tried their peanut butter bagel. When you order a wrap they come with tortilla chips, but kind of odd since you wish you could get a side of salsa to with it.   Overall a great place if you're wanting something healthy and 'quick', suggests calling in your order if you don't like waiting for more than 5 mins in the drive thru."}
{"text":"I can go on and on about Juice & Go and how amazing this hidden gem is, but I will keep it short and sweet because I can sum it up in just a few words.... Refreshing, clean, delicious. healthy, tasty, and simply FABULOUS!!! I am an addict now and find myself craving the Acai Bowls. I always leave there feeling uplifted and energized. Thank you, thank you, thank you ! Already looking forward to the next time..."}
{"text":"Great service and unexpected quality for such a small place. The acai bowls are a must here....and kids eat FREE!"}
{"text":"Stop by and visit this teeny little stand-alone drive thru! Acai bowl is delicious and refreshing!  The wait can sometimes take some time but hey, sitting in your air conditioned car isn't a bad thing.... And it's a good time to write your review on yelp!  Or Call your order in advance! I always get the traditional acai bowl, no agave and it's always yum!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've ever tried juice'n'go! They were so friendly and helpful! The acai smoothie is Soooo good and fresh I just love it! Great experience to start a great day! Thank you!"}
{"text":"All my girls and I love getting food from here. Staff is amazing and they have AMAZING customer service. All their food is healthy and fresh. It's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Love their acai bowls! I always order the acai bowl with soy milk! Their other bases are great as well, but the soy milk base makes it not too sweet."}
{"text":"Amazing service and good acai bowl!  I'd say great only if the acai was less diluted. But all in all I would go back again."}
{"text":"Wow, I haven't given five stars out in a while, but this place totally deserves it, IMHO.  After popping up in the \"New Businesses In Las Vegas\" section and checking out the menu online and seeing they had acai bowls, I knew I had to check it out.  My first experience with these was at Swami's Cafe in San Diego and I've been hooked ever since.  Juice 'N' Go is located in the drive-thru hut at Rainbow and Oakey that used to be a Baskin-Robbins back in the day and then a hot dog place in its last incarnation.  I'm happy to report that the newest tenant is a welcome addition to this side of town.        I did a walk-up transaction, having left my car for an oil change down the street. I rung the doorbell and rather than help me through the customer window, Alex, the owner dressed like a chef, came out of the little hut and took my order.  Their standard acai bowl ingredients are organic acai puree, guarana, strawberries, non-fat frozen yogurt, coconut shavings, and granola.  In addition to that list of ingredients,  customers can then choose two more kinds of fruit; apple juice, coconut milk, or soy milk; and either agave nectar or honey.  My head was kind of spinning with the add-in choices so I just asked Alex what he suggested and he said to go with bananas, blueberries, coconut milk, and honey, so that's what I did.  I ordered the smaller 24 oz. size, paid my money, and Alex offered to deliver it to my car.  I told him I was on foot and he disappeared into the juice hut to make my bowl.  He reappeared to offer me the larger 32 oz. version for the 24 oz. price--who's gonna turn that down?  Not me.  Minutes later, he came out and presented me with today's breakfast and it was fabulous.  All of those fresh, organic ingredients blended together deliciously well.        There are lots of other things on the menu that I will definitely go back to try, especially with customizing orders.  Check out their menu ahead of time if you want to save time in the drive-thru and you can even call in your order.  This is a place that offers organic, healthy options (no HFCS) and is environmentally conscious, too--no paper menus available, they use earth-friendly cups, etc.        **Because I was taking pictures of my order, Alex told me that he gives deals if you check in on Facebook or use Instagram.  Since I was doing neither, I told him I was Yelping and he told me that he will upsize the same way for you if you tell him you heard about him from Terri the Yelper.  Give his place a try and see for yourself.  (I am not related to Alex, nor did I get anything but a great customer service experience and a fabulous acai bowl, or, cup, in this case.)"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Their acai bowls are super good and their wraps are also good wish there was o e closer to my home but really is worth the drive.  Staff is friendly and they used to do punch card but no longer have that.  They need to open on Sunday's for us health nuts"}
{"text":"Finally got to try an acai bowl. The #4 pitaya bowl had great flavor and the serving for the regular size was generous for $6. Very fresh, nice big chunks of banana.  Room for improvement: I wish it had more granola and the pitaya blend was rather watery. Besides these points, would recommend and I am happy to try them again."}
{"text":"I am OBSESSED with Juice n go and their acai bowls!!! They're fresh made by order and simply, the best thing ever!!  Staff is always friendly and pleasant to interact with- So glad theiyre up the street from work! The only thing I dislike is that they're not open Sundays :(  Absolutely delish!!"}
{"text":"Best smoothie and wraps! So happy I'm not stuck going to tropical smoothie anymore! This place is so much better and fresh! The wait is kind of long but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! So fresh and good! New location opened in centennial hills makes it even better!"}
{"text":"I used to love Juice n Go. Customer service was amazing and so friendly. In fact, most times I ordered my acai bowl, they would upgrade it to a large and even give a free smoothie to my son. Now, there are new people working who are definitely not as accommodating and friendly, the bowls aren't as fresh, and there have been no upgrades at all. I used to feel like a special customer and appreciated. I still enjoy the bowls, although because of the long waits in line, the bowls are soupy and melted. Even when calling in an order, you still have to wait for all the cars in front to pick up your order. I miss the old juice n go!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely impressed! First time here and they were so helpful and patient. They explained the whole menu and how everything worked. They made sure we were satisfied with our smoothies before we left and we definitely were! We will return!"}
{"text":"This place is a great little place to grab something good and healthy to drink. you can pretty much customize your smoothies and Acai Bowls. First time going and I got the Traditional Regular sized Acai Bowl.    They're customer service is great and for a lil walk up and drive thru place it's great.    They even give you beef jerky for your dogs.    I plan on visiting this place a lot more so I can try some of the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Healthy organic and delicious. Came here to beacause someone recomended me this place and let me start by sayimg that this place is a must go to if you are looking for healthy delicious place to eat. Unlike places clamimg to have healthy food and unhealthy food in their place. This place screams healthy. The fruit is cut up to order the fruit smoothies acai bowls are amazing. This juice n go is great we deffenitly need more around las vegas. I had a chicken wheat wrap which was one of the best wraps I have had in a really long time. I also tried the acai bowl with banana and mango which was great. Its almost like a parfait but instead of yogurt its a acai berry smoothie. Bit they also have regular parfaits. The customer service experience of this place is great also i parked my car and walked up to the window and aftwr ordering the owner of the place asked me which car was mine and he qould glady bring the order rite out to my car which i thought was very cool and generous . this place gets 5stars and deserves the 5stars for good food and good customer service experience. Deffenetly going back"}
{"text":"I said I'd be back! And now that I'm back I am so happy! The food is amazing and the smoothies are so refreshing and vibrant. I love the service here and the care that they put into each and every order. My favorite drink is the lemon-limeade because as the days get hotter here what's better than some ice cold lemonade! My favorite food here is the quesadillas! They have 3 choices of cheese and a few meats to choose from! Overall a great place to go"}
{"text":"I'm from hawaii where there are Acai bars everywhere! This place, BY FAR, has the worst acai bowls I've ever had. It's like, slush. It's not thick and creamy like I've always had. I don't mind that it's not sweet; because that's what the agave is for. But it was like they blended 1 acai smoothie pack with a bucket of ice. I just don't understand how it came out this way. I also don't understand how they have rave reviews about their bowls. It was DEFINITELY not great. =\"}
{"text":"I decided to finally stop by and try Juice \"N\" Go and wow I could kick myself for not going sooner. I really have been missing out all of this time on some great stuff! My favorite is the traditional Acai bowl and traditional pitaya bowl. Wow, such a treat and a great meal that leaves me full and happy inside.   I am truly a fan and am excited to try more of their fantastic looking menu items!. I really think the staff is Awesome as well. This is for sure one of my new favorite finds in all of the valley!"}
{"text":"First time here! The workers were really nice and described everything to me! He upgraded my acai bowl to a large, but charged me for a regular since it was my first time! Super good :) definitely going to go back soon!"}
{"text":"First time at Juice n Go. I went with my girlfriend who wanted to try it out. We ordered two large acai bowls but were only charged for regulars. We were even given free passionfruit tea! :) highly recommended"}
{"text":"I am no expert, but the acai bowl I had here was refreshing, filling and tasty. Driving around the area during lunch and looking for something a little out of the ordinary I decided to give Juice n Go a chance.   I arrived around 1230 and they were not usually at all. I went through the drive thru and decided on the large acai bowl since there is only a $1.00 different between the regular size and the large.   I was surprised by how large the serving was. Lots of fruit and very fresh and filling. I wasn't sure the acai bowl would be enough for lunch, but it was the perfect serving.   I can clearly make something this simple at home on my own, but let's be honest, I will be back when I'm in the area again. Yes, I am that lazy."}
{"text":"Often I am craving something fruity and healthy and delicious. But I often have the 2 kiddos with me and just the thought of getting them dressed, and in & out of their carseat, bribing them with toys/ candy so they behave- already tires me out. Juice 'N' Go is the answer to my prayers. I just wish it was closer to where I live. But beggars can't be choosers.    The Acai Bowl may be my new addiction. I stopped by for the first time yesterday and had to swing by again today because one bowl just wasn't enough. It's a good thing that I just happened to be in the area both times. Owner Alex said that he also ate it practically every day while in San Diego which is why he had to bring this little shack to sin city. And I am so glad he did.   The large bowl ($7.99) is huge and comes with your choice of fruits and other toppings. I love the traditional flavors of strawberries, bananas, blueberries, shaved coconut, and honey. I don't know if it really has all of the health benefits that this \"superfood\" Acai berry claims to have, but I do know that it is dang good.   I also have tried the smoothies and was pleasantly surprised to learn that when you spend $10, you get a free kids smoothie too. So luckily my kids got to try the strawberry banana smoothie too. And the verdict: they love it.   When you go up to the drive thru, Alex comes out to take your order and gives recommendations if you are overwhelmed by all of the delicious choices listed on the menu board. You then drive up to the pick up window and pay. Since everything is made to order, there is a bit of a wait. Just turn off your engine and catch up on Yelp Talk. Note, if you find yourself without a car, you can also walk up and order too.   Can't wait to try other juices...and a wrap...and the soup...basically the entire menu. In fact, I may just be in the neighborhood again tomorrow. Besides delicious and healthy food, the friendly service is top notch!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for the longest time but never seen to find myself on this side of town.....The gentleman through the drive-thru was super friendly and asked if I had any questions on the menu and explained the bowls a little more in detail. I went with the traditional acai bowl with almond milk and he even upgraded to a large for free since it was my first time.  It was so good!!!!!! If this place was close to home I would literally go everyday. So impressed! Can't wait to go back! Support local!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is so good, here, but the bowls are unbelievable. Great tasting, fill you up, but don't weigh you down. Also a great deal for how much you get too. Looking forward to getting one the next time we are up there."}
