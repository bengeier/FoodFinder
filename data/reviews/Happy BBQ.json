{"text":"I love Chinese BBQ. I eat it all the time. I was happy to see one open in this plaza. Their price is the main reason why I gave them 4 stars. Their food tastes like your usual food court style Chinese BBQ. I find the flavour to be in the mid to high range amongst the sea of Chinese BBQ place in the Markham and Scarborough area. The price however is very reasonable. I got BBQ pork and chicken legs on rice with some extra duck liver for $6.00. This also comes with a bowl of soup. I also got a slight discount (10%) as it is their grand opening. I think it is really worth the price. Parking is horrible but they have a single reserved space if you are just running in for a quick pick-up. I would definitely visit again and often."}
{"text":"Was in the area for work and a colleague of mine recommended this place. A very small BBQ joint but super delicious. The portion they gave was more than I expected for ~$7 and it comes with a drink or soup along with two pieces of meat and veggies with rice. They should put more sauce on your rice though.  If you're ever in the area for some quick filling food, and craving Asian BBQ, this place would be ideal. The only issue is the parking lot, and the limitations on spots."}
{"text":"Here I go again.. driving by, and suddenly bang, my addiction kicks in!  Yep my Chinese BBQ hunger pangs kick in and I need my \"fix\" and I need it now!  Closest \"fix \"at the time was Happy BBQ located in a plaza on Kennedy and 14th Avenue which is one of the newer ones in the area.  Food always tastes better when it's cheap and over here at Happy BBQ it's a really good deal  with 1, 2 or 3 item rice combos going for $5.00, $5.50 and $6.00 respectively.  Portions are really good sized and includes the house soup when is actually quite good.  An extra fried tofu is only 60 cents extra so great to add onto your meal.  Ordered the BBQ Pork and Roast Pork combo.  The meat was flavourful and not too fatty which is the way I like it.  It's not the best BBQ I've had but at the price that they have for combos you really can't go wrong.  Parking can be brutal in this plaza especially during dim sum hours due to the adjacent Fancy Restaurant.    Happy BBQ gave my addiction a Happy Ending!!!"}
{"text":"Went there end of the day, nothing much leave. Order the BBQ pork and chicken on rice. The pork was so hard and overcook.  But on other hand, the chicken is very very soft and tasty."}
{"text":"Happy BBQ serves up some decent bbq at a reasonable price. Food court like self serve atmosphere with food served in styrofoam bowl and plates.  But a bowl of rice noodle with any topping for $4?? And there is even some vegetables? Great as a snack!!! I highly suggest the BBQ Duck.   Friendly service. And grand opening special 10% off  Cash only.  Parking could be a little tricky during prime dinner and dim sum time as it is located right next to Fancy."}
