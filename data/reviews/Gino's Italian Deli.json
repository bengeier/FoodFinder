{"text":"It's pretty quick to get in and out, even during lunch when there is a line. While some of their items (like the pasta) seem pricey, the sandwiches are comparable to Subway in price and much better in quality, and I'd rather support Gino's anyway. There is a small discount for cash payment."}
{"text":"Not bad! This is not Chicago good but fresh and full of flavor ..... that should get your attention. I or my wife stop and get a something every time we are in Madison. The deli is a treat offering a variety of sides including meet balls ..... bring some"}
{"text":"Really great subs.  One downside is if I'm really hungry one sub doesn't quite cut it.  Love the lasagna too.  The meat lasagna is actually MEAT lasagna.  Or maybe meat disk lasagna.  (its very meaty) They have some good take and bake dinners, some Italian grocery items like olive oils, pickled veggies, sauces, etc."}
{"text":"I stopped making my own lasagna after coming here! Their lasagna (both meat and veggie) comes in pans for home or you can get a slice and eat it there. The owner and his staff are always very friendly. Gino's is one of my favorite places to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Fresh bread invites you in! Generous portions of meat! A variety of fresh salads! Great for lunch or to grab dinner to cook at home! Be sure to get the cannoli!"}
{"text":"Gino's deli is awesome!  It's not a truly \"authentic\" Italian deli, but it's as close as you're going to get in suburban Middleton.  The subs are invariably excellent; the bread is high-quality and the meats are delicious.  The cheese tastes mainly of salt but, then again, I've never actually had a sub where the cheese is anything but mediocre.  Anyway, you can't go wrong with any of the sub choices.  I particularly recommend the Italian beef or the Italian.  The pasta dishes are also great.  I've been having the ravioli since I was a kid (and the Middleton Gino's was located on Allen Boulevard) and it's always been a favorite of mine.  I also really like the chicken alfredo penne; it's pretty garlicky but absolutely delicious.  There are also some cold pasta salads that are worth checking out.  If you have a family to feed, Gino's sells premade pans of meat lasagna (they require 24 hours notice to make vegetarian).   It is some of the best lasagna I've ever had.  They are very generous with the meat sauce, which is great news for carnivores like me.  Gino's sells a few boxed pastas and some pasta sauces as well.  The selection is similar to what you'd find at a grocery store with only a few interesting products, so it's not worth coming here just to check out the grocery.  However, if you're just here to pick up some lunch, it could be worth your while to pick up a few other things too; the prices for everything are pretty reasonable, and the discount you get for paying with cash makes it even better.  If you are the Middleton area (or even if you aren't) you should make it a point to check out this place."}
{"text":"I LOVE Gino's and started enjoying their subs, salads, and lasagna over 10 years ago. I moved out of state a few years ago and always made a point to stop at Gino's to grab my favorite sub when I was home visiting.  The lasagna also quickly became the staple that my mom made the nights we flew back to visit.  We now have moved back to the area and I am happy to say that nothing has change at Gino's.  The same friendly staff, and my favorite sub is still perfect."}
{"text":"Great prices, efficient service, and really good food! We got the meatball, italian beef, and sicilian-- all of which were really flavorful and did not skimp on the toppings. The sicilian was probably the least favorite of the three, but still was enjoyable.  The italian beef was loaded with beef, but some of it was slightly fatty.  The meatball had several meatballs, not dry at all, and the marinara was excellent.  Great experience overall."}
{"text":"My family and I have been regulars at Ginos in both Middleton and on Verona Road for years. Both are our go-to places for a quick lunch/dinner or for big family parties. It's always reliable and the staff is friendly too. I love ginos!"}
{"text":"The meat lasagna is what it says, meaty. I think there is a layer of mozzarella at the bottom which I loved. My only complaint is that there was no layer of cheese on top that you could brown for the last 15 minutes of cooking. It's all sauce. For $35 for a family size, it is pricey but well worth it. I'd buy again for sure."}
{"text":"I only ever get the #1 here (Italian).  Because it's good and I like it and what's wrong with that?  There's one guy who makes them better than the others, so I like it when he's there.  I think he puts just the perfect amount of dressing on.  Nothing extraordinary here, but a solidly good sandwich that I can't pass up when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Gee whiz, this place is goooooooood. Per the man behind the counter I went with the #13 spicy Italian. Finished that and had the turtle cheesecake. It was most fantastic, must order."}
{"text":"I have only been here when I had half an hour or so for lunch and craved some warm, hearty food. Their dishes are yummy, ready quickly, and served hot! Prices are decent, as well, and their little eating area is cute and convenient."}
{"text":"AWESOME lasagna!!    I could probably eat a whole pan of it by myself in one sitting, however my wife would probably divorce me, so i reluctantly choose to eat it in moderation."}
{"text":"My parents came to town to visit me and my wife for the afternoon.  I was craving lasagna, but didn't want to spend a couple hours making it so off to Gino's.  The lasagna was delicious.  It tastes home made and in the very best of ways.  Great garlic bread as well.  I've also gotten subs and pasta salads here a few times and have never been disappointed.  The cash discount is also a nice touch.  Keep up the greatness Gino's!"}
{"text":"I have wondered what this place was like for a long time--Glad I listened to the fellow yelpers. The meat lasagna was marvelous! We have a great family recipe and are always very critical of other lasagnas--as many others know few can compare to a good homemade lasagna but this one is outstanding.  Try it out some night, stop in and pick up the premade lasagna, cook it at home for the family. It was $19 for a platter that could feed a family of 6 comfortably. You could also get the individual serving to taste if you don't believe me."}
{"text":"Poor quality . lasagna was bad. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I want to marry Gino's greek pasta salad and have its babies.  I work at a fine dining restaurant in madison, yet whenever I bring that salad along to snack on during my shifts I constantly have to stand guard against my fellow (food snob) servers trying to grab a forkful.  Bring home a cold pan of the lasagna and heat it up in the oven. Pretend you made it yourself.  Look on in amazement as your boyfriend/girlfriend proposes."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing.  Great selection of salads, meats and to-go pastas and Italian entrees, all with high-quality ingredients.  The subs are awesome (my fave is the #4 on Italian) - even the small is large enough to for a satisfying lunch.  Be sure to get a slice of turtle cheesecake for dessert... it's a slice of heaven.  Oh, and bring cash to pay instead of credit - you'll save some coin with their cash discount."}
{"text":"Although they still get three stars overall, I just want to reiterate that there pasta salads are good (visited a couple more times since my last review).   It's nice to have a change of pace of chips and sandwiches.  So, here's wishing they would serve a scrumptious muffuletta, but until then I'll stop by for a container or two of a pasta salad, like the chicken pesto pasta salad!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda split on the review. I really want to love this place, but at best, it's 3.5 stars. The bread is amazing. Make sure you get the asiago; it's so freaking delicious. The meat and cheese combinations are well done, as are the toppings.  So, what's my issue? Well, the sandwiches are 70% bread. The toppings are kinda sparse, which isn't a crisis, especially when the prices are so low. However, aside from the meat and cheese, you'll have trouble finding anything else on the sandwich. It may say \"peppers,\" but it really should say \"pepper.\"  Overall, a solid bunch of sandwiches, and a cool shop, but the skimpiness leaves you pretty depressed. So close to greatness, but still, so far."}
{"text":"Delicious Sicilian sub and Greek pasta salad. As soon as you walk in the smell grabs you. They also offer a cash discount. I can't wait to go back to try something else on their menu.  The pastrami sub will probably be my next choice."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Italian deli in the Madison area. Great selection of sandwiches and sides. Love the pizza ingredients to make your own pizza at home and their frozen lasagna is the best I've ever had. Definitely the place to go for all things Italian!"}
{"text":"Their lasagna is awesome.  I brought it over to a friends house for a pot luck and we all now call it \"crack lasagna\", and giggle a little bit.  It's good stuff, watch out you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"Every time we visit family, the lasagna is a must have. No need to ever make your own when Gino's is available."}
{"text":"Gino's Italian Deli on Century Avenue is my go-to option for any time I don't feel like cooking or if I'm in the mood for an excellent sandwich.  In college I worked at a similarly-themed restaurant/deli so my expectations weren't too high when after college I moved out to Middleton.  I knew of the place and had driven by it multiple times but had never stopped until a fortunate visit from my father.  After helping me move a couch, my father took a look at my spartan apartment and said, \"Well at least you're pretty close to the Middleton Gino's.\"  Upon learning that I hadn't ever been to either the deli locations or the State Street restaurant he insisted on getting subs that night.  Even four years later I can still remember how satisfying it was.    Over the years I've moved several times but I've never strayed too far from Gino's.  I enjoy the hot subs to such an extent that I haven't managed to work my way through the menu yet, but here are a few of my favorites.  My standard order is the Italian beef with giardinera peppers, provelone and a dip.  I couple this with a quarter pound of the Cajun chicken salad and I'm set.  I've gotten into a few disputes over the authenticity of the #12 Italian beef compared to the Chicago standards, but I believe you like what you were introduced to and for me this is the best it gets.  The #11 meatball sub is another favorite, so much so that I usually have a hard time deciding when I get up to the counter.  The cold subs on the menu are not to be overlooked either, although I find myself doing this all the time.  My personal favorite is the #14 artichoke & turkey.  The sweet and spicy honey mustard on this is perfect with the artichoke hearts and cucumbers, and this sandwich keeps well in the refrigerator so I like to take this in for lunch.  The #7 roast beef is great in it's simplicity - just thinly sliced beef with lettuce and horseradish sauce.  I like to pick up Gino's before heading over the Capital Bier Garten to meet up with friends and family, and the #7 tastes incredible with Capital Fest and 1900 (RIP).  Gino's is more than just sandwiches.  The lasagna is very well done and the fire chicken is a special treat.  When I get subs for dinner I often pick up a piece of lasagna for lunch the next day.  Just cut it in half and microwave it for three minutes.  I've also gotten a refrigerated pan of lasagna and cooked it for a big dinner before, and it turned out very well.  There is a decent selection of dry goods and sauces on the shelves, but being not so much of a cook myself I can't say I've tried any.  One thing to note - there is a cash discount so you can save a bit.  The prices are pretty cheap to begin with: my usual order of a #12 with Cajun chicken salad and lasagna for the next day comes in around $10.  There are times that I get bored with Middleton compared with downtown Madison, but having Gino's nearby makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"I can't speak to a lot here but I can speak to the LASAGNA. It is A-MA-ZING! Making quality lasagna at home is neither cheap nor easy, therefore I have no problem justifying this purchase. I almost always buy a Gino's lasagna and their garlic bread for my kids birthday parties. Everyone always loves it. A large pan is around $44...and I buy the large pan even if it's just for my small family because...LEFTOVERS!  Also, the vegetarian lasagna is as amazing as the meat lasagna! It is so, so tasty.  Having an easily available and delicious vegetarian option is great when non-carnivores come to town. I personally am a carnivore and I still like the vegetarian lasagna just as much as the meat variety. I've yet to meet anyone who didn't think Gino's lasagna was worth every penny so, on lasagna and garlic bread alone, I highly recommend.  P.S. Bring cash - it's cheaper."}
{"text":"Update: A sign on the door says hours are now restricted because of \"employee shortage.\"  Call before you visit to make sure they're open.   * * *  Gino's Italian Deli is what's left of Gino's on State Street (which I'll chiefly remember as the place that ruined dinner with my parents when the owner or manager spent a full five minutes loudly cursing out the waitstaff in front of every customer in the dining room).   Unfortunately, that bad-vibes tradition seems to have survived the move to this corrugated shack outpost, where grumpiness was on full display during two of my last three visits.   As for the food, meh. There's little here that can't be found for less and at better freshness and quality levels at Metcalfe's, Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. Even Hy-Vee will get you 90% there at 70% of the cost.   And they should probably keep the door to kitchen closed. It may be clean, but it doesn't look clean."}
{"text":"Truly wonderful spaghetti and lasagna.  I've been there twice and have been impressed with the food and the service"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's where I stop every time I visit Madison. Great subs, great family business."}
{"text":"Love this place, and so does everyone I tell about it. I've been going here for 17 years, and never tire of their offerings."}
{"text":"I have been going there since I was a kid, awesome place, great food. Try the lasagna!"}
{"text":"Stopped here during our lunch break. Both of us loved our subs. I got the Sicilian on asiago bread. Absolutely amazing!!!! Best bread I've ever had with a sub. Also got the grilled chicken pesto salad which was also very good. Prices are very cheap also. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"\"I wanna be a meatball from Gino's\" Sandwiches, meatballs, homemade lasagna, cheese, and the oh so famous chicken pesto salad.  It's all good.  If you are picking up lunch or dinner from here, please let me know so I can swing by. When you walk in and smell that perfect Italian Deli scent, you know you're in the right place!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Gino's for a very long time and still love it!  In fact now that I live in Chicago it has become a ritual that my mom brings a pound of the tortellini salad every time she visits.  Great prepared salads, fresh bread and awesome lasagna!  Pick it up, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome! The food was fantastic and the prices are unbelievable! They only have seating for a couple people though, but its fine for a quick lunch. This is a good place for take out."}
{"text":"Whether you want a pan of lasagna or a quick sandwich, this is your place to go.  This is more of a 'pick up and take home' type place, but they do have a couple small tables if you're on the go.  You get a discount if you pay cash instead of a credit card... Which for me is totally understanding."}
{"text":"Gino's is a small Italian deli right next to Home Depot. They sell fresh Italian groceries and offer a good selection of food goodness.   I came here for lunch quite often because it's really cheap and tasty. I'm a big fan of Gino's lasagna and their sandwiches are amazing. The Italian sub, the hot meatball sandwich, and the hot Italian beef sandwich are my favorites. The best part is that you can order things in bulk, like the lasagna. Gino's can conjure up a large pan of lasagna for you to take home and enjoy for the week.   It's never too busy here and on a good day, you can sit outside."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for the best lasagna in town.  If you call ahead they will even cook it for you.  In addition, they have a decent selection of pre-made pastas and sandwiches to order behind their deli counter.  If you have a quick need for garlic bread, sauce, or certain italian staples there is decent chance they have at least one option, but don't expect 10 varieties of olive oil, or the offerings of a full grocery or deli.  The staff is nice and helpful.    They also don't take amex so bring your visa."}
{"text":"After driving past Gino's deli probably around 1000 times (no joke I passed it every day to and from work for six years) my husband and I decided to stop in for a sandwich after a long afternoon of being outside. We were not disappointed by any stretch of the imagination. Gino's deli is a medium sized store that offers artisan goods such as olives, bread, cheeses etc. but it also has a large deli counter where customers can order one of their made to order sandwiches. I had the turkey and artichoke and my husband got the meatball sub both of us were extremely happy with our choices. They put a good amount of meat on the sandwiches and they taste extremely fresh. The prices are also right... Each sandwich was between five and six dollars and were substantially sized. So if you're in the area or passing by definitely give Gino's a try!"}
{"text":"This is basically a Jimmy Johns by the highway, with a quick simple sandwich. I got the veggie sandwich, but I felt it missed the mark. While the atmosphere and the name are cool, sandwiches at Subway, or even Jimmy Johns, are better. There are also is pretty limited seating here."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Decent Italian deli, but kind of new age design. They have a lot in the deli case, meaning sandwiches and pre-made salads(which I cannot comment on), but I was not impressed with the lack of Italian grocery items. That part seemed sort of half assed to me. They have frozen lasagna (kinda pricey), homemade sauce (reasonable), pizza crusts (cheap), and cheese (moderate). Worth a drop in."}
{"text":"The food at Gino's is unbelievable. The pasta sauces and made-to-order sandwiches are delicious, but the lasagna stands out from everything else. It is a bit pricey, but easily worth it. The pasta salads are somewhat oily but very flavorful. Generally when I order a pasta salad it ends up looking better than it tastes, but not so at Gino's. I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"It was average. Not quite the same as italian delis in Chicago, but ok, I guess."}
{"text":"Horrible store that does not support its best asset, their employees. Why fire an employee who requested 1 day to go and protest a bill that will negatively affect your business. Thumbs down on Gino's."}
{"text":"Gino's Italian Deli is amazing! It offers a lot of grab-and-go salads or deli options to bring home and stick in the oven later. Their sandwiches are amazing and reasonably priced. We also totally recommend the lasagna. While it might seem a little spendy at first, it is totally worth the money and makes for excellent leftovers. The staff is really friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place.... Best kept Italian secret!! Ran in here on a whim and was pleasantly surprised food was awesome, staff was super friendly and helpful for us newbies!! Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"My first Gino's experience was at the Verona Rd location, and I was in love(Hello...offer me Greek salad with chunks, not crumbles, of feta and I'm yours forever).  You can imagine my excitement when we moved to Middleton...a block away from the Century Ave. location!!!   This store seems a bit smaller than the other, but just as high quality. Great sandwiches, and you can purchase the tasty meats and cheeses that they use. We get the half baked loaves of bread on occasion...mmmm. I've also heard that the lasagna is hearty and delicious. Will be popping in soon for a pan full."}
{"text":"I'm not a city person so delis are new to me. This was nice, with a clean and updated interior. Not a lot of seating."}
{"text":"I used to live by here and have gone here for various things. Looking at the reviews, I'm quite sad I never tried the subs. All the other food in the cold section is delicious though. The store is lovely and is much nicer on the inside than the outside leads you to believe. The staff is beyond friendly. Unfortunately, the price made me not come here too terribly often."}
{"text":"This Gino's has been here for what feels like my entire life (Native Madisonian.) And it STILL is a treat!   Aside from the Italian cheeses, meats and salads that you can pick up at the deli counter, there is a made to order sandwich counter.   Of course, there is ready made lasagna and other premade treats in the cold case.   Gino's should be a stop on your path!"}
{"text":"I love the antipasto and the #13 on Asiago. Gino's never disappoints. The service is always great too, a true Madison original."}
{"text":"First sandwich I had here...  a \"Pastrami Plus\" on Asiago bread....  was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  OK..  maybe I'd been craving a pastrami sandwich for a week or two.  Every moment.....   In any case, that sandwich blew me away.  I couldn't believe it!   For $6 (maybe not even that!) I'd gotten a sandwich that lined right up with Bari in Chicago.  I called all my friends.  Asked my girlfriend if she'd consider moving up to Madison.  We could stay.  There was a good sandwich place.  Then it all fell apart.  I went back the next day, and wished I'd gone to Cousin's.  Went back two more times over the next two weeks and for some reason they just couldn't duplicate that first one.  I don't know what to say.  I mean...  they weren't *bad*, just disappointing after that first one that was just *so* freaking good.    I also had their veggie lasagna once, on the recommendation of a friend (who raves about it btw).  Honestly, I wasn't impressed, but I'll admit that making lasagna is \"my thing\" so I sort of resent when it's anything less than 5 stars.  Anyway, for the friendly people, the cheap prices, and that first sandwich...  3 stars to you, Gino's.  Occasionally I'll be back....  like a long-lost lover returning to the place he met an old love whom he never saw again."}
{"text":"Hands down, far and away, the best deli in Dane County! The sandwiches are wonderful and very reasonably priced. The salads are great, love the cajun chicken and the antipasto! And the lasagna? Do yourself a favor and take home a lasagna. Also, they carry Eli's cheesecake!!! Bonus."}
{"text":"Love love loveeeee Gino's! If I could afford to take the entire store home I would!!! You can not go wrong with anything on their menu but their turtle cheesecake is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Generally, I try to support local businesses if my budget allows and I happen to be in the right place at the right time.  My last visit to this particular Gino's resulted in an experience that I would have to consider the next time I am in that area.  My appetite was not voracious, so I settled on a small meatball sub.  While the size was appropriate (or even a little generous), there were issues needing resolution.  The meatballs themselves were basically hot enough, but I had the feeling that they were \"reheated\".  One had enough pink in it that I was also questioning whether they were uniformly cooked.  The spice composition was adequate, but not memorable.  Typically, a balance of fennel, garlic and other spices should be present-not so, here.  While the bread had a definite authenticity, it certainly wasn't made that day, and may have even been several days old.  The entire sandwich would have benefitted from a sauce with more depth and less cloying sweetness.  While I was making my sandwich selection, I couldn't help but notice that the raw ground sausage was being stored unwrapped in the same case and in close proximity to the sliced meat.  Not cool!  Finally, the seating area consists of two utilitarian sets of cast iron tables with chairs, and the room has about as much warmth as the waiting area at a muffler shop.   It pains me to give only one star for this branch, but I should also make it clear that the OTHER Gino's Deli in Middleton has a much cleaner and more inviting operation.  If you must get your fix, go there."}
{"text":"Cool local Deli, fast service, good sandwiches. Take out."}
{"text":"Ehhhhh.... Yeeeeaaaahhh... Sooo.... I grew up in Chicago eating the finest Italian Beef sammiches the world has to offer. Gino's isn't true Italian Beef. The Au Jus sauce shouldn't come served on a the side. Real Italian beef will double dip in the sauce regardless of if it's for take out or not.   I haven't tried anything else off their menu besides some of the side dishes which are a bit too $$ for my taste. Overall, I am not a fan of Gino's."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a fresh, homemade deli sub to go (we took them for a picnic lunch at Wollersheim winery on our way out of Madison). And while you're at it, pick up gourmet ingredients for dinner! What a treat. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Food is mostly good, but the staff were all about themselves. More interested in their personal lives than serving the customers. The lasagna is good, but quite over priced. At least at fast food, the service staff are well trained and polite."}
{"text":"Pay with cash (for a discount). They have an ATM there if you need one. The sammies are so good. My two favs are the spicy italian and the veggie one. Their pre-made salads are really tasty. I love the shrimp pasta salad."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Gino's yet!? They are consistently my favorite \"cheap\" place to get a sandwich in Madison. Sure, if you just want a turkey sub or a veggie sub, there's not going to be a great reason for you to pick Gino's over somewhere else in town.  But if you want hot pastrami, Italian, or meatball subs at a good price, look no further. I'm not usually a \"double meat\" girl, but consider it here if you are hungry. It's inexpensive and gets you the perfect balance of bread to meat.  It's also fun to check out the groceries and other takeout options. The whole lasagna....OMG. It's pricey, but it's worth it. A perfect splurge when you have a family gathering.   This is the kind of local, reliable, inexpensive place you go for a quick lunch during the week or when you are busy running errands on a Saturday. Nice because you can also pick something up for dinner. Not much seating, but have always found a place to sit and eat my sandwich when I wanted to.  Plus a small discount for using cash!"}
{"text":"Who knew? No seriously... Who knew this was here?   Solid marketplace for on the fly Italian ingredients and a decent Italian beef sammie. Wish there was more space to eat than the two tables which practically feel outside given the draft, but I think this could quickly be a great grab-n-go option for me on that side of town."}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem. Didn't know this place was open. More then just a deli. Great place to grab lunch. They offer about 11 different sandwiches. They are also a deli offering several breads, salads, and pasta. There is also multiple Italian foods and oils offered also.   Seating is very, very limited...its more of a grab and go place. If you pay with cash...you get a discount."}
{"text":"I had the Italian Sub. Tasty. Quick service, quality ingredients and locally owned. Enjoy;)"}
{"text":"Really cute deli my family always stop at on our way to the cabin. It has frech delicious food. And the interior is really pretty. Get your sandwhich on the asiago bread. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Gino's French Dip with Provolone dipped in Au Jus with Sweet Peppers is the best! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really tasty subs! I'd hate to see the calorie count for a sub here, though. They have super fast service.   We also have gotten the bake-at-home lasagna at their Century Ave location in Middleton. It's a little price but very good!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Madison. Hot Italian is boss. Good bread, salads, and their lasagna is amazing but a little pricey. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, not sure why I have not done a review.  This place is always solid, never had something that wasn't good.  Sandwiches beat the pants off other sub places, and I can't seem to get out of the place without a container of Cajun Chicken Salad.  Soups are good, entrees are good.  If you need a quick lunch or dinner that won't break the bank this is a good option.  They also give you a discount for paying cash, another plus.  Try them, you'll like them!"}
{"text":"At first glance you might not look at Gino's and think \"Let's go there for lunch!.\" But think again. Gino's serves up some of the best on-the-go sandwiches I've found in Madison. I love the veggie sandwich--it is packed with loads of flavorful ingredients like olives and artichoke hearts and a zingy vinaigrette, all delicious wheaty bread. Very reasonably priced!  The market is noteworthy as well, offering all you authentic Italian culinary needs. Plus, there is a great selection of prepared foods (fresh and frozen) that will jump out an you and call \"dinner.\" I've tried the lasagna and wasn't disappointed. It came with a huge portion of french bread.   The staff at Gino's is always friendly and helpful."}
