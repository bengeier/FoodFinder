{"text":"I've only been here once but it was a great experience. First; the view of Pittsburgh is amazing! I had the Veggie Strudel and I thought it was amazing! The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 instead of 5/5 is that I wish they had more of a mixed drink menu; its really  just wine. We had to ask them to make a certain drink but they were happy to do it. If they make a mixed drink menu, I think they would attract more people. The server was nice, kind of quiet, but nice. I recommend everyone going here!"}
{"text":"Our group of 4 was seated 40 minutes later than our reservation without an apology from anyone. After the meal we found the service was so slow it was no wonder why we were seated so late. Food was cold and quite bland. I ordered the chef's sampler menu and only the bananas foster was above average. 

The worst part of the night was having to ask for the manager after never receiving so much as an apology for having to wait so long for a reserved table. The manager (Tony) had no idea and could not have cared less. One of the worst dining experiences I've had in Pittsburgh. 

If you are looking for a nice place on Mount Washington, Monterey Bay is about the same price point with much better food and vastly superior service. Although your local Applebees would have better service."}
{"text":"So one of Pittsburgh's most expensive restaurants also has some of the worst food? How do they even allow that to happen?

I've lived in Pittsburgh a long time & have never visited the LeMont because I heard that the food was not worth the money that they charge. But I was there recently for a wedding reception. And let me tell you, with so many outstanding places to eat in Pittsburgh, there is no reason to ever spend $45 on a filet mignon at this place. The food was AWFUL. The appetizers that they took around consisted of dried up chicken & sausages on a tooth pick with peppers (completely dried up meat) and some kind of bread thing stuffed with a super dry meatball that appeared to have been microwaved. I got the filet mignon as my dish. It was under cooked, tough, chewy and FLAVORLESS. Seriously, zero flavor. The side of potatoes & the veggies appeared to be pre-made & microwaved as well. The potatoes tasted salty, but had no flavor. This is the quality of food I would expect to see at an Eat-n-Park, not a 4 star restaurant. I mean, who wouldn't devour a delicious filet mignon? But I couldn't even eat it, it was THAT bad.

I have no idea how this place is still in business. It should be a crime to charge people $100 for dinner & serve them bland, microwaved food."}
{"text":"My parents took me to Le Mont for my birthday.  I was very impressed with the interior and the amazing views of the three rivers and the city of Pittsburgh.  Once seated our waiter was very professional and we were looking forward to our meal.  

Before the food was served a woman slipped on the stairs and came crashing down on our table.  She landed face first and my girlfriend and I helped her back to her feet and were both shocked that the guy attending with her did not offer any help.  

When we sat back down we noticed that my mother was soaking wet from one of the drinks and a glass of water thrown at her by the force of the woman crashing into the table.  The biggest shock of the whole incident was the lack or response or sincere apology from management, it was downright disgusting how they did not react in a professional manner.  

Having worked in the restaurant industry for several years it was by far the most ignorant treatment I've seen from management."}
{"text":"Pros: 
- The view.  Grab a window seat and enjoy the best view of Pittsburgh.  
- Service.  Like another reviewer, I had Angel for a server and he was great.  Attentive, friendly, but didn't constantly bother you.
- Food.  I got the goat cheese stuffed shrimp with prosciutto and it was one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten.  It was one of those courses where you honestly sigh as you savor the first bite.  

Cons:
- Bar.  I was not very happy with my 7 and 7.  However, the rest of my table enjoyed their drinks.
- Food.  My entree was the \"Cracked Pepper Filet - Lightly dusted in a trio of cracked seasoned peppercorn...\"  This was no light dusting.  It was completely encrusted with pepper and it completely overpowered the flavor of the filet.  Beyond that, they overcooked it.  I asked for medium rare.  It wasn't overcooked egregiously, but more than I'd like considering I'm paying $45 for it.  It was a real thumb to the eye to see someone else at the table order a steak to be more done than mine, and hers was actually more rare.  It wasn't bad by any means, but these aren't mistakes I'm willing to accept from a supposedly 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I've lived in Pittsburgh for a long time, but never had a chance to visit this landmark establishment. My wife and I went recently and had a great time. Our waiter, Marco, was very attentive and professional, he really made the experience a treat. I got the Steak Diane and a Caesar Salad both of which were made table-side; what a great addition to the high-class atmosphere. My wife said the Salmon was excellent and liked it so much that she wouldn't share :). If you've been here before, I definitely recommend coming back, and if you've never experienced one of the most unique restaurants in the region, I can't stress enough that you're really missing out."}
{"text":"the best view from mount washington

so so food - can't remember one dish from having been there 3-4 times the last two years

received very bad service one visit - manager very apologetic and offered to not charge us for the meal - we declined and ordered  dessert instead"}
{"text":"We held our wedding for 56 guests at the Le Mont on May 24, 2015. We could not have been more pleased.   Everything was fantastic. Our guests raved about the food ( as well as the view) which included passed hors d'oeuvres (crab cakes, tuna tartar, and several others),  Entrees  included sea bass Luticia which was encrusted with toasted sesame and topped with jumbo shrimp (out of this world!  I would return to have this dish again, it was  that delicious). Everyone raived about it, the Filet and the Chicken Marsala. Crab cakes were also enjoyed. Fingerling potatoes and grilled vegetables accompanied the dishes. The portions were generous too.

 Bill was a pleasure to work with, responsive, experienced and patient as we planned our event.  Tony and banquet staff ensured the evening was a great success.

We highly recommend the treasure of Pittsburgh's Le Mont particularly for a wedding or other celebration as the banquet rooms feature a wall of windows over looking the skyline. 

I don't think there is a better venue on Mount Washington for a quiet dinner with a spectacular view, well prepared food, excellent service and a classy, but not stuffy, atmosphere."}
{"text":"Le Mont  isn't the type of place I'd ever choose to go to myself seeing it's fairly expensive and a place where I'd have to cross my legs, sit up straight, and use the right forks- that and the decor reminds me of a dilapidated mansion. But after a delicious pomegranate martini I couldn't care less what kind of restaurant I was in, the cliche view was great and the food to follow even better. Not really \"different\" enough for my taste... just another fancy restaurant but the service was great and I'd recommend it to someone trying to impress a date."}
{"text":"Pretentious, mediocre service and noisy.  

We called at least a month in advance for a window seat to celebrate our 1st anniversary and for an early time to better secure a nice table. We were seated, albeit, by the window.. but we were put by the tables where the staff unplate food
(no attempts seemed to have been made to be quiet with the on going clean up). 

The basket of rolls was cold - as was our butter.  Worse was that out waiter was poured ACROSS our plates to our glasses- no attempt was made to walk the few steps to properly pour from our right sides. The different staff assigned to different tasks seem to have no personality and wore ill fitting 'uniforms'. Our waiter had to read specials from a sheet.  My steak was full of grizzle and my husband said his crabcake had no flavor. i agreed. 

We decided to head out without dessert... couldn't leave there fast enough. The view was the only thing amazing- and our time there was so full of  errors that we just could wait to leave. I'd have rather have ridden the incline a few times and gone somewhere where they truly care about service and the quality of the food.

It really seems like LeMont is resting on it's 'reputation'. It's time to wake up - train your staff, offer quality food and make your customers feel valued. Even the hostess - upon our departure, was too busy having fun with her co-worker to even thank us for coming.  We won't be back.  I expected so much more from LeMont."}
{"text":"Disgusting place. Wine list is short and stupid. Food is both bad and badly cooked. Waiter knew nothing. I thought they couldn't ruin simple lobster tails, but they did - they overcooked the already freezer burned things. I had to use a serrated knife to saw them. Please don't come here."}
{"text":"The view is amazing, but the thrill stops there. My husband and I came here for our anniversary.  The food is mediocre at best.  I had the calamari for an appetizer.  I've made better calamari myself. My entree was crab cake.  It was supposed to be seared, however there was a breaded crust that seemed fried. It was pretty much flavorless with the exception of the crab taste itself.  

If you'd like to dine with a great view, eat before to lessen your disappointment."}
{"text":"The view is spectacular but that is where it ends. The food is horrible. Ice cold. Bad service. The worst part is they have the nerve to charge outrageous prices for this awful food. It really is a shame because it is a gorgeous view of the city."}
{"text":"I love the Lemont, longtime Pittsburgh landmark,  always a wonderful view. The staff  is polite and well trained in spite of the previous comments. However the food is mediocre and uneven now- they should be competing with the best restaurants in Pittsburgh and could raise their prices if they did. We went with old friends for the Sunday night special- normally their specials are good- but the entrees were absolutely terrible. I had the pork tenderloin and it was almost inedible. My husband had the beef tenderloin and he said it was fine. Our friends had the salmon - overcooked- and the chicken. Chicken looked like it needed more sauce. The creme brûlée dessert was very good.  The food we got was what they must serve at their many catering functions- plenty of weddings there- but if you are paying for a nice dinner, it is no wonder it is not crowded"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for a long time but never ate at the Le Mont because I've always heard mediocre reviews of the food. Several friends and I went this week for the winter tasting menu, a 3 course meal for $30.

The entree options for the tasting menu were diverse, which was great for a large group containing a few picky eaters. Unfortunately, none of us enjoyed our food or experience enough to go back again. 

After reviewing the wine menu I asked the waiter to tell about a Riesling and a Pinot Noir on the menu. He started to describe the difference between Rieslings and Pinots in general, which is common knowledge I didn't need to be told. I was hoping for specific information about the wines so I could pick the best wine for the table. He should have admitted he didn't know about the wines and deferred immediately to the sommelier.

The bread was served warm and everyone was OK with their first course of soup or salad. However, we all agreed, the entrees were bland, as if the chef didn't know how to properly salt the food when cooking. 

Dinner service was not as good as I expected for an upscale restaurant. My friend's wine glass was spotted and my soup spoon was dirty, and utensils were not cleared between courses. For example, my salad fork should have been taken when I ordered soup as a first course or, at least, before dinner was served. The cocktail menu was also left at the table until dessert, even though we were all drinking wine. 

For dessert, 3 of us ordered the pecan ball, a Pittsburgh classic. It was served too cold to dig a spoon in to and we had to all wait about 10 minutes for it to warm to a reasonable temperature. At a nice restaurant, I expect food to be served at the appropriate temperature.

I'm glad I went once because now I know that I haven't been missing anything."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!! My husband and I dined here for our anniversary, and it exceeded my expectations. We had requested a table by the window (definitely do that) and they had one reserved for us. We weren't in a rush, but I thought the service was great, and the staff was so polite. The food was beautiful and delicious. We got the french onion soup (which was a presentation within itself), the stuffed portabella mushrooms (again, nice presentation), the chef's special entrees, and dessert.  Dinner took around 2 hours, but for a nice date when you're not pushed for time, I would absolutely recommend Le Mont!"}
{"text":"I took my family to the LeMont last night. We waited over an hour and a half for our food.
Our waitress Beth never explained or gave a reason for the delay! When we received our food it tasted as if it was sitting for a while. It was terrible!! Now this not a cheap restaurant and portrays itself as a fine dining restaurant not even close.
The food was terrible and the service was worse. We will never go back and will tell everyone about our terrible experience!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times but this time was warrant of a review. 

Food was better than average for a big group of 30 for Sunday brunch. Except we had no brunch. It was a fixed menu. Salmon or chicken? 

All the food tasted ok. But crinkle cut carrots is a thing of the past! 

They claimed the bread truck was stuck in traffic on the parkway. How classic of an excuse. 

Servers appearance was terrible. 2 servers for 30 people is terrible. We needed drinks and ended up making them ourselves. 

This place is clean but just so out dated!!!! 

Valet is nice. The place was empty on a Saturday. This place can't last too long. The gold decor is so tacky. Time for a remodel!!!!"}
{"text":"Awful and way over priced.  Food seemed pre-prepared and was flavorless.  Was very disappointed with experience and will never go back."}
{"text":"As others have said, you come here for the view, not the food. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful with classy decor. We got seated right in front of one of the huge windows with a gorgeous view if north side and the point, so it was worth it. It was beautiful to watch the sun set and the lights come on in the city. 

That being said, the food was mediocre at best. We got one of each of the main entrees as a part of the spring/summer dinner menu and each one was underwhelming. I wouldn't recommend any of them. 

Furthermore, the service was also not great. The servers kept trying to clear away plates we were still working on. They would bring on the next course before everyone was finished with the previous one. We got the distinct impression that they were just trying to hurry us out of there. 

If you come here, come prepared to enjoy the view and the decor of the restaurant but not much else!"}
{"text":"LeMont saved our New Year celebration.
We made reservations at a restraunt down the street and were unable to sit down to eat our food for 3 hours after the time our reservations were for.  
We walked down to LeMont and they sat us immediately.
The view is beautiful and our service was good.
Food was great. We had the pork chop, osso bucco, and our friend had the sea bass.  All of which was wonderful.
Give this place a try and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Another old restaurant that you are paying for the view. Ok, but unimaginative food. Overall a skip based on price and style."}
{"text":"I am glad that we went here for restaurant week because I would be very upset if we spent the money they ask for on the regular menu for such mediocre food. I understand that you pay for the view/service/ambiance but I feel like they served us a freezer meal. The service was great but we will not be back. Pittsburgh has so many amazing options for much cheaper prices!"}
{"text":"The building and view are beautidul....and that's the only reason why I gave it two stars. The waitress had limited knowledge on fine dining cuisine, the calimari was over cooked so we told the waitress, she returned it to the kitchen and came back out asking if we wanted something else and declines to remake the dish stating \"that's just how they make it. they won't make the dish again because that's how they cook it and it will come out the same way.\" My father asked for fresh lime in his beverage and the waitress said she'll have to check and see if they have any limes, that they didn't have many in stock. The young man filling our water and butter on the table was smacking gum so loud you could hear it across Pittsburgh. He also refilled our table water by reaching over us, so instead of pulling the water glass off the table and pouring it properly he poured the water with the glass directly ont to the table resulting in spilling ice cubes.  I had chucks of solid cheese in my pasta that wasn't melted, missing tomatoes, my dad's escargot was over cooked, my boyfriends steak was flavorful but a poor cut of meat & they ran out of half of their dessert options. Overall they are just stuck in the 1970's with their black tie outfits and old school menu. Save your money, enjoy the view from the overlook and find another restaurant with better quality."}
{"text":"Where to start?  The best part of this place is without a doubt the view.  Amazing on a clear night.  The food and service are another thing all together.  In the party of 5 that attended our dinner we ate filet, sea bass, salmon and veal.  All were served with a twice baked potato - horrible.  It was not hot, hard and completely without flavor.  I had the filet.  It was a tough flavorless hunk of meat that was not eatable unless you doused it with A-1 and salt.  The bernaise sauce was flavorless, watery and would not have been good paired with anything on the menu.  The food looked like it was pre-prepared and considering that it was not busy it seems lazy to not make it fresh, but you could taste that it was sitting refrigerated somewhere in the back.  The server was SLOW as molasses and not very astute to the needs of the customer.  Note to servers: when your customer is doing the \"chicken neck\" looking for you that's a signal you are needed.  He was fast with the bill, but that would be about it.  Horrible food.  Save your money and go somewhere else.   The ride to the top is a lot cheaper than the bill you get at the end of the night."}
{"text":"we went to Le Mont in May 2009.  went there for dinner and to enjoy sunset at the same time.  a friend and i both ordered sea bass and another friend ordered scallops.  the food was ok, the sea bass was cold.  we asked the waiter to reheat the fish, but it came back a tiny bit warmer.

service was great though.  our waiter was awesome and friendly.  he gave us suggestions on where we should visit while we're in pittsburg.

great view of the whole city!"}
{"text":"I have gone here twice with my husband the last time in January to celebrate my birthday :) both times we have experienced exceptional services and wonderful food. And of course the view is breathtaking. I would highly recommend dining here!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was superb, but not quite up to the $30/plate price that accompanied it. The views are more than amazing, no doubt about that. You can see the entire city lit up at night . I would recommend this restaurant, but make sure your are dressed up fancy to fit in with the other clientele."}
{"text":"I recently attended a fashion show and luncheon for Genesis of Pittsburgh at the LeMont, and I was so impressed.  Our food (both passed hors d'oeuvres and our luncheon entree of Chicken Bruschetta) was fantastic.  It was bright, light, flavorful and perfect for an afternoon lunch.  The service was wonderful; from the servers to the bartenders, everyone was professional and courteous, yet also friendly and personable.  Of course, you can't speak about the LeMont without mentioning the unique atmosphere, which truly is breathtaking and worthy of special occasions.  There is something very special about a room with a view like that, and I did pause and take a minute to think about how beautiful our city is.  The decor inside is lavish and impressive.  I told my husband later that we don't dine at the LeMont often enough, and he agreed.  Our city has a vibrant dining scene, and part of that is this classic that really is such a wonderful Pittsburgh tradition.  We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I set up an initial appointment at Le Mont about 18 months in advance for our Oct '14 wedding (second wedding for both me and my wife) and considered several other well respected and highly rated venues in Pittsburgh as well.  After our initial meeting with Bill Laughlin, the Banquet Manager, I knew we were in very good hands.  While I think all brides and grooms believe their unique requirements might be forgotten in the details, I will say that Bill inspired confidence in us that things would go precisely the way we wanted.  On things we were unsure about he offered suggestions that allayed our concerns, sometimes it was just his comment to us \"Don't worry I'll take care of that\" that reassured us.   We came to dinner there the next evening and after a few more questions and answers Bill had all of our paperwork prepared and we put the deposit down.  Our next big planning event with LeMont was nearly a year later and that was the tasting which went extremely well...done personally for us, full sized portions of all the items we requested so we could see the meal size...very very nicely done.  I had explained to Bill that a number of our guests would be restaurant and/or winery owners, and I wanted to feature the best items on the menu.

The wedding day approached and my soon-to-be-wife (who is local to Pittsburgh) did most of the coordinating and she commented how smoothly and perfect all the planning was going with Bill.  In the day or two prior to the wedding we delivered all the items we needed to have there, and all vendors told us they too had a very easy time coordinating everything with the restaurant staff.  The venue itself is truly one of the most amazing views you'll get in any city...perched atop Mt Washington overlooking the city and the stadiums.  We had great weather for the afternoon and into the night.

We had our wedding ceremony and reception for about 100 guests in the larger banquet room and it all came off perfectly.  Bill and Tony orchestrated all the timing for the entrances of the bridal party, cueing the DJ, and other musicians.  The food was really excellent...how often do you hear that about a wedding?  This is first and foremost a restaurant, and the food preparation seemed much more personalized and precise than what I've experienced elsewhere for large groups.  The service was excellent throughout the night.  We had high end wines and the top shelf bar, and the bar staff was great with my crowd.  My friends from the restaurant and wine industry all remarked to me how much they enjoyed the meal.

At the end of the night there were no surprises in the final billing, and my wife and I felt we had the wedding of a lifetime.  Bill, Tony, (and the owner Mr. Dunlap) made us and our guests truly feel like VIPs and we most definitely got our money's worth.   Two and a half months later I can tell you that many of our guests have contacted us to say what a great wedding we had, and how much they enjoyed the food, the service, and the beautiful venue that reminded them of a gilded-age mansion.  

I would highly recommend LeMont for a wedding (or any other gala) for anyone who is looking for a Pittsburgh venue.  My sincere thanks go to Bill for all the flawless coordination over 18 months leading up the wedding, and to both Bill and Tony for outstanding execution on the wedding day.  We plan to continue to come back for many more special occasion dinners!"}
{"text":"In short, spectacular views of the Pittsburgh skyline, gorgeous dining room, old world feel and service, and mediocre food.  I am glad this place survives because the ambiance is fantastic. If we return, it will not for the food."}
{"text":"Nice for a special occasion because of the view. Can't get a better view anywhere in Pittsburgh. I recommend going at night in particular for a great view of the skyline. 

I gave 3 stars because the food was subpar regardless of the price. Most everything was under salted. My wife's Caesar salad was supposed to be prepared table side but wasn't and didn't come out until I was finished with my lobster bisque. When the salad did come out it was soggy and the dressing lacked flavor. My wife ordered the chicken saltimbocca which was very bland. Her potatoes looked nice but were very overdone. I had the veal and shrimp dish which was very good but the risotto which was cooked perfectly lacked flavor. Overall very disappointed in the food.

Service was good with a very professional waiter, good maitre'd, and excellent valet. Unfortunately the kitchen was really slow despite not being overwhelmed with guests for a Friday night.

It was nice to try once for a special occasion and because of the view but I won't be a regular here."}
{"text":"My wife and I took our two teen-aged nieces to the LeMont for a special dinner on a recent weeknight.  We were hoping a for a memorable evening, but we got less than that. 

Our service was slow and perfunctory. While the waiter was pleasant enough, empty dishes sat on the table for too long;  there was a long gap between appetizer and entrees; the dessert cart was wheeled up to our table and abandoned for 10 minutes or so while the waiter assisted with the large party seated next to us. When the waiter finally came to review the dessert selections, I had to prod him for the selections not on the cart, specifically the Bananas Foster which my wife and I wanted to try. In sum--I felt that the service was fine, but that we weren't getting the best that our waiter had. 

The food was, on the whole, fine. The girls both had  filet mignon, which were butterflied to accommodate their request for medium well. My wife ordered the Neptune's Feast, a seafood platter that she enjoyed, commenting that it was well seasoned and tasty. My Salmon en Papillotte was almost completely without taste, despite the crabmeat garnish. All of the entrees were served with a routine green beans and carrot mix and a twice-baked type mashed potato, sans skin, that appeared to be made in bulk and served with all of the entrees. 

The girls ordered chocolate cake for dessert, which they declared \"yummy\".  The Bananas Foster was well presented by our waiter, but the bananas could have been riper, and I'm not sure that it was flamed long enough as the sauce was quite runny compared to others I have had.  Almost predictably, the waiter forgot my requested coffee refill until we were ready to leave.

Needless to say, the view was spectacular. 

All in all, it was an average meal, served in an average way, at an above average price in a terrific setting."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there today for the Winter Pittsburgh Restaurant Week. They offered a 3-course meal for 35 usd excluding tax and service charge, which seems to be the standard price for this event. The restaurant was up on Mt. Washington so the view was breath-taking and it wasn't so crowded as we thought it might be. However, the food was a huge disappointment, starting from overly dried and hard bread and super salty tomato soup. I got Capuccino filet for Entree and I have to say that they were no different than the ones I got from cafeteria. A side of mash potato was so dried that I couldn't eat. The caramelized sugar on top of the creme brulee wasn't even caramelized. I don't think we'll be back here soon. The service was great, though."}
{"text":"I ended up here as a result of a business function. As such, we were given a private room furthest away from the main dining room. The view was spectacular on a rainy day, and after the sun set, we were treated to a fantastic show of lightning bolts.

Too bad the food was just meh. I had a basic salad and a filet mignon. The rolls served to our table were white and crusty; they tasted like Rhodes frozen rolls. The meat was fine but it was accompanied by some sort of yellowish sauce. I tried the sauce and it tasted exactly like mayonnaise. Fortunately, it was not poured all over my steak or it would have ruined it. For dessert, I had a fresh fruit tart and quite frankly, I get better fruit tarts from my local grocery store bakery.

Too bad the service was NOT friendly. There were many comments about our server's demeanor. It was almost as though she didn't want to be there at all. I feel bad for our host who probably paid out the nose for this so-so meal and the mandatory gratuity for the grouchy server. I was just happy that none of my personal money was going to this establishment. I would have been very mad if it was

Too bad you can't eat the view."}
{"text":"We had our wedding lunch here and the view was amazing. It's located within a short walking distance to some hilltop views for photographs. However it may be too much for the elderly to walk up the street, I didn't realize it until the day came. I give the rating 3 stars instead of 5 because the food was just OK, the wedding soup had too much salt and the cups are served quite small.  I also didn't realize that the wedding soups were not in large bins in which guests can have more than one serving.... I guess I should of clarified myself better when asking about it. Also note the pastry cart is not assortments you can pick from a tiered tray.  That would of been really cool to have that to have some variety of each one.  The desserts were fantastic, I recommend the chocolate mousse cake.  Also -- ask about flowers and other decor. They don't provide floral arrangements unless you give a heads up to order them!"}
{"text":"The view of downtown Pittsburgh is ridiciously nice - especially on a clear night. The interior is very elegant with chandeliers and piano music. The food isn't as great for the high pricing. However, the desserts are pretty decent. A great place for an anniversary or special occasion. Sometimes, I don't understand why they don't hire better chefs. By the way, valet is only like $5 so it's worth it."}
{"text":"Not quite sure how to go about reviewing the Le Mont, so I'll just go with my initial feelings throughout the meal. It was my first time here so perhaps I had higher expectations, but that never really came through. After taking my girl out to the Grand Concourse and Eleven for previous special occasions, I decided to surprise her for our anniversary by setting up reservations at the Le Mont. Upon request, I had made reservations for a Saturday night in March at 7pm and asked for a window seat being that we've never been there before and since we were celebrating something special.

The place is elegant, don't get me wrong. I was quite taken back by how amazing the interior and exterior were decorated. My girl, being an architect and interior designer was in awe of the place and barley spoke to me as she was taking it all in. We liked the old school feel to it. It made us feel like we were in an episode of AMC's Mad Men dining so elegantly. We got a nice seat by the window, unfortunately it was a very dreary night so there was hardly any visibility. My luck of course haha.

We were excited to get some drinks to start, but after looking over their cocktail list, there really wasn't anything special that caught our eyes. I was kind of expecting some interesting/different cocktails that I've never heard of before but not much out of the ordinary. I settled for a Manhattan on the rocks, and she a Dirty Martini. Both were made very well though.

For starters, we got the shrimp bruscheta. It was actually really good. Small tomato's, red onion, cheese, greens, and a vinaigrette dressing delicately garnished the dish. For my first side, I got a salad which was very generic. It actually kinda disappointed me. There was enough french dressing drenching the vegetables that it could have been used for three salads. My girl opted for the lobster bisque soup as her first side and it was quite delicious. I wish I had ordered that instead as I kept dipping the bread we were given in her bisque. 

For our main dish, we both had ordered some kind of fillet off their Winter Menu which came with a soup or salad, your main dish with starch and veggies, and a desert of your choice. The fillet itself was good. Bigger than I expected actually. It was wrapped in bacon and covered in peppercorns. I enjoyed it, my girl thought there was too much peppercorn on it though and she had to scrap allot of it off. The \"starch\" that came with the fillet was just bland. It was like half steak fry, half home fry. That sounds good to me, but they were pretty soggy as if they had been sitting in a vat all evening under a heat lamp.  Also big long carrot sticks and asparagus came as the veggies. Carrots, I'll pass on that and the asparagus was ok, but once again nothing special in that department...

The best part of the night were our deserts. I got the pecan ball which was pretty good and she got the creme brulee which tasted amazing. 

Our bill for 3 drinks and 2 winter special en tree's (once again you got a soup or salad, main course with starch and veggies, and a desert) came to about $120 without the tip.

For how much I wanted to like the place and enjoy it and say we'll be back again, I'm not too sure about it. Maybe for drinks and appetizers in the future. Don't get me wrong, the place is gorgeous, the view is equally as good, even the valet parking was cheap for a Saturday night, but when I compare this meal/experience we've had to the Grand Concourse or Eleven (which you can also read about in my previous reviews) this experience just wasn't up to that level. The food just didn't seem to be hot out of the pan and fresh. Soggy potato's and veggies, kind of a warped salad, a little too heavy on the seasonings. This stuff is all easily fixable with some good plate presentation and fresh out of the oven/skillet consistency though.

If your looking for a special place to get dressed up and impress your girl or entertain the family for a special event you might want to try it out. By no means was it terrible, but as I see its a 5 start restaruant I thought I would critique it a bit more than other places I've been too.

Happy eatings my fellow Yelpers!

{"text":"My daughter had her wedding reception at the LeMont on November 11th.  When we were planning her wedding we looked at a number of venues throughout the city of Pittsburgh.  We finally decided upon the LeMont and I have no regrets.  
Bill Laughlin and his staff are absolutely wonderful.  They are so supportive and flexible.  Pricing is not as bad as you would think.  I truly believe that they are the best bargain in the city with the BEST QUALITY.
Leading up to the wedding celebration, Bill and his staff were so responsive to our questions and answered them promptly.
The day before the wedding we delivered a number of items to be displayed along with over 3000 cookies.  Bill and his staff did not even blink an eye.  They said not to worry and that everything would be ready when we arrived on Saturday.  THEY WERE RIGHT!!!
That evening the celebration went off without a hitch.  They food was well prepared and served hot to the 199 guests in attendance.  The hors d'oeuvres were a delight.
Our guests were very complimentary.  
The view is also a wonderful extra.  
If you are considering the LeMont for any type of event you SHOULD make your reservation NOW.  If you go any other place you are going to pay too much and not get a good return on your investment.  Bill and his staff look at each event as if it's their own family event.   Pittsburgh wake up, this is THE PLACE to hold a wedding reception or any other special event.

{"text":"I agree with all of the reviews of this place.   It is over hyped.  Yea the view is great but as with most restaurants with a view the food never lives up to it.  Please try Isabella or even Monteray bay before shelling out le cash for le mont."}
{"text":"This place is not worth the view! The food is incredibly underwhelming, comparable to a microwaved frozen dinner. It does not match the fancy decor. Pick a different restaurant."}
{"text":"My family chose Le Mont to celebrate a college graduation. Our server was excellent, going well out of his way to accommodate our every need and make it an extraordinary experience. The wine selection is wonderful. Our table was against the window, as requested, and we were able to watch the sunset throughout our four courses (delicious) on a beautiful evening. And completely unexpectedly, there were fireworks at the point as our decadent desserts arrived. The ambiance is slightly dated luxury, but still works. Our experience here was exactly what we sought and then some."}
{"text":"Very beautiful! was such a gorgeous place the view was a widescreen HD version of Pittsburgh point with the ducky in the river at the time I went. There was live pianist and singer that was just great. It was so pretty and formal like something right out of the titanic. I was pretty on edge I suspected my BF would purpose to me on this night at this restaurant which later I found to be pretty cookie cutter for Pittsburgh and lacking originality. It was really a great time but I haven't gone back we have since split and it taints the place for me unfortunately because my other half knows as do I that I got engaged here lol. 

Other then the obvious reason for not returning lets point out the positives. Great lighting. Nice wait staff, clean presentable and possibly the best view of Pittsburgh EVER. I got a Caesar salad which the waiter made table side and I got to ask questions about anchovies paste and what he was adding in our dressing. The salad had an acquired taste but still pretty good. I got a filet with mash and carrots. The meal was great is wasn't super over flavored which allowed me to taste the quality of the beef. The meat was much better then other places in the burgh and its wasn't too expensive. The night ending bill for apps, salads, diner and dessert was only near 100 and in the end they served me with a plate, plated with a diamond ring strawberry syrup in the shape of a question mark. They were really helpful helping the ex plan and definitely could tell it was something they were used to doing but i couldn't help but feel i was just another piece of meat on their engagement assembly line. I wish the location hadn't been tainted with a failed engagement cause they are a decently priced night out for any occasion or celebration, im not saying its cheap enough to invite other guest but i would definitely recommend this place for quiet romantic dates especially at night. Just if you plan to propose do it else where, I found when i was telling my engagement story to those who asked I heard comments such as how cliche, or how original, or gee-sh who hasn't got engaged there? Don't get me wrong it was great but give your gal a creative and love felt engagement stay away from going with the grain. MAKE IT SPECIAL. Make this the anniversary spot instead lol. I do agree that below food is kinda bland and mediocre for the price."}
{"text":"I am super disappointed at our experience last night! We went for my sister in law's 40th last night and it was awful.

The main problem in this restaurant is the value. Each entree averages around 30, but many are in the 40s. I had the filet newburgh and ordered it medium rare. First, it came out almost completely well done. I sent it back. When it came out the second time, it was blue rare (only seared and nothing more). The manager came over and was appropriately horrified, and offered another meal, but by that point everyone was already done withy their meal so I declined. The seafood on top of the steak was over salted to the point where I could not even eat almost anything on the plate. They did make another and then wrapped it up for me... However, 3 diff tries at one dish is insane. 

My husband got the Neptune pasta. The noodles were overcooked and the sauce was mediocre. If this was Applebee's it would be fine...

The service was terrible. I understand our waitress was new. However, even when you are new, they should not let you have a table on your own until you can answer questions knowledgeably (what the size of desserts are, what types of wine pair with things, etc.). While this is not required of a restaurant where entrees are in the teens, for sure it is if you pay 30-50 dollars for an entree!!

The water glasses were always empty. They didn't bring out any bread until the main course. They immediately brought out packed up food and placed them in the middle of the table before we even got dessert. They forgot to acknowledge my sis in law's Bday with a candle/cake. They brought out one dessert and then we all waited 10 min for the remaining desserts. A huge tray fell right behind the Bday girls chair where the inexperienced wait staff dropped everything on the floor from another table. Then they forgot to take my meal (which was incorrect twice) off the bill and we had to wait again for our waitress to fix it.

This all happened while music alternated between Elton John and margaritaville, which is more appropriate at a beach bar...

One or two of these things are understandable. All of these things together are insane and not appropriate for a meal that cost almost $500 for 6 people. If it weren't for her Bday, I would have totally made a bigger deal of all of this at the restaurant. However, it was her special day and I didn't want to further ruin it.

This place needs to make major changes to the service and the food.

1 star for a great view."}
{"text":"When I asked the server to suggest some of their best dishes, his reply was \"everything is excellent.\" The view was excellent, but nothing we ate there qualified. If you're going to freeze your steaks, don't expect people to be pleased about spending $40+ for their entrees. I will most definitely go back for drinks, but not for dinner (unless of course they hire a great new chef who completely reworks the menu!)."}
{"text":"I came to the Le Mont for an event with about 35 people. First impressions when I walked in was that it could use an update, but then I sort of found the dated decor charming and I think it plays into the character of the place. 

There's no denying the amazing view of Pittsburgh. If you are visiting from out of town, this could be a great place to stop for a drink and some quick city shots. With that being said, be prepared to pay a pretty penny for a drink. I had a glass of Pinot Grigio and it was $10, I just didn't think it was worth it. 

On to the event- the servers were awesome and you could tell they loved the restaurant and were truly passionate about what they do. I really appreciated our servers knowledge and engagement. I, sadly, was less than impressed with the food. For the price everything is, I was expecting to be blow away and I wasn't. I had the salmon with a bourbon maple glaze. While the salmon was cooked to my liking, the glaze tasted more like a maple syrup. Maybe it was just a personal opinion, no one else at the table got the salmon. Lastly, desert for me was creme brûlée.  The sugar topping was not caramelized as it traditionally is, but merely plain brown sugar sprinkled on top. Again, maybe it was just a personal thing. 

Appreciated the event but I'm not running to go back just yet."}
{"text":"If it were just for the view this place would be unparalleled but they proudly advertise and display their culinary credentials. The service and the view were impeccable, but the food was wanting. Perhaps it was because it was a Sunday night, perhaps it was because we ordered from the 50th anniversary menu (One dinner wanted the chicken that wasn't on the a la carte  menu. Between 4 of us we had chicken, veal, sole and swordfish. The sole had to go back due to bones, the chicken and veal were mostly flavorless and the swordfish was dry. Most disappointing was the unmistakable taste of instant mashed potatoes. Although mine actually did have chunks of real potatoes, these were obviously dried or someone went to great lengths to make them taste that way. 

It is truly unfortunate that such a nice place with such an outstanding atmosphere and service served up food so far under their own advertised standard. It, in all truth, cost them a very prestigious VIP dinner."}
{"text":"What. A. View. Le Mont made for a fantastic rehearsal dinner for a friend's wedding. The food, drinks and service weren't out-of-this-world good, but there was nothing wrong with them. Again, the view makes up for all shortcomings."}
{"text":"Outstanding anniversary dinner!

I had not been to the Le Mont since I was a small child and figured I was long over due for a return visit. I easily made reservations thanks to the Open Table app. 

The whole restaurant just screams old money. My wife and I were easily the youngest diners there by at least 20 to 30 years. LOL! The space was impeccably clean, but could definitely use a remodel to make it more modern and current. 

Unbeknownst to me our wedding anniversary was during Restaurant week and at the time the Le Mont was running a $30.16 special for three courses. You had a choice of a soup, salad, various entrees and a dessert. We each chose the broccoli cheddar soup and a house salad. For our entrees my wife chose the blackened shrimp fettuccine and I chose the surf and turf. It featured a center cut 6 oz. petite filet with three Grand Marnier glazed shrimp. For dessert we both chose the pecan ball.

The broccoli cheddar soup had perfectly cooked broccoli and a load of cheesy goodness. It was very good as was the house salad. My surf and turf was outstanding as my steak was perfectly cooked, extremely juicy and tender. My shrimp with that Grand Marnier glaze were superb! My wife really enjoyed her blackened shrimp fettuccine as well. The pecan ball was simply amazing and was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. 

The wait staff was impeccable and made sure we were very well taken care of for the entire duration of our meal. Just when we thought our date night could not get any better the manager sent over a slice of their incredible chocolate cake as a anniversary surprise which we took home as we were completely stuffed.

The Le Mont is a Pittsburgh institution and offers one of the best views of downtown Pittsburgh. I highly recommend it for a romantic date night or special occasion."}
{"text":"You are paying for the view.  It is breathtaking.  The decor is old-school and dated. The service is fair - not terrible, but not worth the price.  The food is ehhhh - not the worst I've had, but no where near what you would expect for the price point.

Recently here for an event.  The salad was extraordinarily overdressed with a balsamic dressing.  The main course was a filet. These might have been the biggest filets I have ever seen.  They were cooked perfectly, much to my surprise (banquet beef is usually overdone).  It was served with a bearnaise sauce that we passed around the table. I should've passed on the sauce- it had little flavor.  The steak also lacked seasoning and was under (or maybe not at all) salted.  The sides were carrots (cooked nicely- cooked through but still maintained some firmness), green beans, and some roasted potatoes (would have been nice if they had some more seasoning or sauce). 

Be forewarned, valet parking is $6. A little steep, in my opinion, but Mt. Washington parking can be tricky.  The prices at the bar weren't outrageous- charged me $1.50 for a diet coke."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for special occasion dinners as well as weddings and while the ambience is incredible, the food has been quite inconsistent. My reason for giving it 4 stars is during my latest visit, the food was not as bad as my previous experiences at the LeMont. 

I've always ordered the filet mignon, the same way every time. However, they've come out nearly every level of doneness: well, medium well, medium, ... you get the idea. In terms of taste, they provide a hollandaise sauce and still, it doesn't add much flavor. My latest visit, the filet was a perfect medium rare and I enjoyed it. 

Perhaps dining here on a night other than a special occasion (like a wedding or holiday) would be better and yield more consistent food?"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to visit the Le Mont for a Yelp event recently. The venue has an incredible view that will never get old. The service was great, and everyone was very friendly. We had a three course meal, which was a great way to get a taste of the menu. I had the cream of broccoli soup, steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables, and the funnel cake with pumpkin ice cream. I wish I could say I was as blown away by the food as I was the view, but I can't. Everything was decent, but it wasn't anything that I would rave about. I do think that the prices are more reasonable than I expected, so I would be more open to visiting again knowing I won't be spending an insane amount of money. The bar is a nice little space too, so maybe stopping by for a drink will be in my near future!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience. My family and I made reservations here for Easter brunch over a month ago, and when we get to the restaurant they first tell us that we did not have reservations, then they told us they had our reservations and then they told us that they were over booked and could not seat us. The woman who spoke to us was extremely rude and I was appalled by how the situation was handled. 
I definitely would NOT recommend this establishment to anyone I know. This was the only day my family and I were going to be in the same city at the same time and just wanted a pleasant waster brunch. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"What an interesting experience...

The electricity was knocked out in most of the area, and Le Mont was no exception.  However, this didn't stop them from pulling together a very nice candlelit experience! 

This past weekend wasn't my first time there but definitely the most memorable.  Who knew the sparse generator powered lighting paired with candles on each table would provide just the environment to enjoy looking out at the Pittsburgh downtown skyline.

The food was great, not exceptional, but their current anniversary special is quite the deal.  My swordfish was cooked rather well.  If you've been thinking about checking it out, do it soon!

Great place for a date, celebration, or just a special night out."}
{"text":"I was invited to Le Mont for a dinner reception a week or two ago and was thoroughly impressed. Incredible view of the city, very elegant setting (tuxedos and chandeliers galore), and excellent service to boot. Food was pretty good (although I didn't foot the bill, so that could have something to do with it).

I wouldn't mind returning again."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. The view is beautiful.  Prices are high and I expected that but I also expected the service and food to be a lot better. 

I have never seen mozzarella strikes come as one big ball. It was supposed to be hit but not a hint of spice to it.  Calamari was okay, have had much better. 

Went we walked in I thought it would be a nice place for a quiet dinner.  But after trying the food I wouldn't want any money there.  

Two starts are because of the view of the city.  That's all they got going."}
{"text":"My friends and I (totally 12 people) celebrated our graduations here yesterday night. Unfortunately we didn't realize it was mother's day and therefore couldn't have a try of the celebration menu. We ordered the \"today's soup\" with crab,which was hearty and tasty. Another appetizer was the vinaigrette salad. Some of my friends tried various steaks. I tried the shrimp and grouper myself. The shrimp was superb!! I also got some steaks from my friends, but I think the huge shrimp beats all. We chose three types of cakes as dessert -- Tiramisu,chocolate and blueberry cheesecake. I didn't try the chocolate one, but personally Tiramisu is so delicious that we became big fans. The service is also good. I really enjoy the night."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is it's view. Others are meh. Strip steak is a bit disappointing. Don't like the flavor, taste a bit sour. Wish the taste is worth the price =/."}
{"text":"My friends and I got sick after eating lunch here last week. Sick for hours, sick. I reached out to the restaurant who told me there was no way to determine if it was their food that made us sick because no one else alerted them that they also got sick. Terrible food, terrible customer service. The view is nice but it's not worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Make sure you see Dani at the bar for one of her great special drinks."}
{"text":"Being here on a business trip the Sheraton recommended this place with a good view of the 3 river area and downtown. Its a unique experience to ride the Duquesne Incline to get to the top. Just make sure you have exact money 2$ or else your going to end up with a pocket full of quarters.

I was seated by the window and had a great view of the city. I had a crabby old guy as my waiter, who then later Angel stepped in. He was great, and a very nice guy. Service was exetremely good after that.

As an Appetizer I had the onion soup au gratin. It wasnt what I expected. The cheese was completely melted over the bowl, and it was a thick mozerella instead of the normal gyrer. It was very tasty I thought. For the main course, I tried something odd I had never seen before. Salmon Wellington. It had Salmon of course, but was stuffed with crab/shrimp as well. It sounded better than it tasted. It was ok. Not as flaky as I remember the beef wellington I had at the Paris in Las Vegas. It was very hot. The vegetables it came with were overly salted. Desert was a fresh berry cheese cake. It was very good, and I had a Churchill port that was right up there with the best of them.

Overall I think I have to agree with everyone else. You come here for the view, and the ride up the mountain. Its a fun time, and Im glad I did it. Le Mont is supposed to be an icon around here, and Im glad I was able to visit such a place."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception at LeMont in April 2013.  I am extremely confused about posts regarding poor service or tasteless food.  The staff was amazing from start to finish, and the food was delicious.

The view - Our reception was in the downstairs private room, but the entire restaurant is exactly the same... all glass, totally breathtaking view.  When it gets dark outside, the city lights below are so beautiful. We were lucky enough to have not one but two fireworks shows go off in the city that night, and the fireworks were at eye level up at Lemont, and the guests were having the best time it was so amazing.  The restaurant itself is super clean and is beautifully decorated in a black, white, grey and metals color scheme.  The decor reminds you of eras gone by, but it not outdated at all it is very classy.

The staff - The event manager, Bill, was one of the most accomodating people I have ever met.  The staff both at the tasting and at the reception went out of their way with 5 star service.  They filled special requests my guests had, no questions asked.  I mentioned someone had just spilled a little bit of a drink on the dancefloor, and I am pretty sure the waiter sprinted to clean it up, it was done that fast.  The owner himself even came down during my reception to say hi, check that we were happy, and say congrats, and I thought that was very nice of him.  The restaurant even sent us a sizeable gift card after the wedding was over, a very generous touch. We plan to use it next time we are in PA!

The food - My only regret was scheduling my tasting right around Thanksgiving. I was already so full, and the food at the tasting was so bountiful and delicious it was a hard problem to have haha.  Our reception featured crudite, brushetta tower, several passed apps, and a seafood station, and the meal was soup, salad, and several entree options.  Guests were commenting all night about the delicous food, and how they were so happy it was so good and not standard \"wedding food.\"  I said that is because Lemont is a 5star restaurant to begin with."}
{"text":"How is this place still around?  I don't know how it isn't unanimous that the food is bland, boring, and rather awful.  It isn't just that the food is extremely disappointing, but the decor and atmosphere are so outdated that it is also painful.  I understand that they have impressive real estate but I don't know how that can even save them at this point.  It's just all BAD."}
{"text":"We went here for my bf's 22nd bday. It's on top of Mt. Washington, and for those of you that don't know it's one of the MOST beautiful views you'll ever see. 

That was probably the best part about the restaurant. The food from appetizer to entrees to dessert can all be described as uneventful, especially for such a pricey venue. 

I would most likely choose one of the many other fantastic restaurants if I were to go back to Mt. Washington."}
{"text":"There are pros and cons here. The pros: great views and friendly staff. Cons: food was average and the decor was dated. If I am paying for a high end dinner experience I expect at least all of these areas to be on point. Glad to have gone to check it off my list, but probably won't be dropping anymore coin here."}
{"text":"No, it's NOT just the view overlooking Pittsburgh. It's not just the amazing decor, and brilliant atmosphere. The food and service speaks for itself. From the host to your waiter, I'm certain you shan't be disappointed with LeMont. My girlfriend and I happened upon this gem, and if ever in the area again, we will certainly go again."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant was the view. My fiancé and I are visiting from Charleston, SC and have had reservations at this restaurant for months. When we arrived, we waited in a line for 15 minutes, then we were finally seated.. at a 2x2 table that was crammed in a corner at the end of a handicap ramp. Our waiter  had to bring our individual appetizers on one plate, that way it would fit on our arm length table. When we asked our waiter if we could move to a bigger table, he said none were available(as I was looking at the bigger empty table next to us that remained empty the rest of the night). The restaurant was pretty busy which probably was the reason we waited an hour for our entrées. We ordered the lamb and New York strip with total shock of how much we hated both. Lastly I order crème brûlée for dessert and as my waiter brings it out to me, he says \"careful, it just came off the burner\".... it was cold. Just all around an awful experience."}
{"text":"Not a good place for drinks and snacks! Would def come here for a fancy classy little dinner though!"}
{"text":"There is an old rule of thumb that the better the view the worse the food. This places disproves that. The view was spectacular and the food didn't slip below mediocre. At least the food was consistent with the service. 

If you want to feel like you stepped into a bad episode of Madmen, and pay dearly for it then this is the place for you. Otherwise there are much better places in town for a great dining experience. Of course without the view."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and have a nice night since we are from out of town. The restaurant itself was absolutely beautiful and very elegant, the service was absolutely fantastic as well. I wish I remembered his name because he was one of the best servers I've ever had. He was fun and quirky while extremely well-mannered and professional. The view from our table was exquisite, and it really made the meal that much better. I had the veal loin neptune and my boyfriend had the filet mignon, and both were delicious and cooked exactly how we liked! Would definitely recommend for a romantic night out!"}
{"text":"While the restaurant offers a nice view of Pittsburgh downtown, their food is horrible. They taste similar to college cafeteria food. Everything we tried seems pre-made and has been left in the kitchen for hours. Their salad tastes like a pre-made bagged salad that you can find in any grocery stores. The sauce on the veal tastes similar to the gravy that you can find in any school cafeteria. The meat is bland. 

The food at this restaurant is much worse, and even more expensive, compared to other fancy restaurants on Mt. Washington. If you want to come here expecting good food, you will be disappointed. If you want to come here for their view, you should book a reservation for other restaurants in Mt. Washington. All in all, do not waste your time and money dining here."}
{"text":"View is great.My waiter (Michael) was a snob. I asked for cocktail sauce and he rolled his eyes.  Food was just average at best. I have had much better meals. Great place for dinner with a view, but expensive with marginal food."}
{"text":"I came here with a big group of friends while visiting the 'burgh for a buddy's wedding. There were 10 of us in our party and we visited on restaurant week.

I'll start with the good: the view here is amazing! Definitely make a trip to the top of Mt. Washington if you're from out of town. Don't visit this restaurant though, the view is the only thing giving it a second star.

The food was... mediocre. Nothing was offensive, but nothing was worth the $35 price of entry either, I can't imagine paying the regular prices for it. My gf and I both had a salmon dish that was just very meh. Everyone else at the table seemed to feel similarly about their food.

What made it worse was the service. They were unable to split checks, poured the wrong wine in to glasses (mixing it) and were just generally rude and unaccommodating."}
{"text":"The Le Mont is probably one of the best restaurants I've had the opportunity to enjoy. The whole thing is an event, remember to make reservations months in advance, and be sure to request a seat by the window. This restaurant owes a great deal of it's success to the wonderful view. If I remember correctly, our total was well over 400$ not counting tip, so expect to shell out some change. Most of the food is a la carte and you can order items off the menu if you so choose. We had sunset reservations, when we arrived it was still daylight out by the time we left it was completely dark. Expect to shell out tips for other things like the coat check and other items."}
{"text":"I love the Holidays. What I don't love is spending hours cooking and cleaning for Thanksgiving dinner. Not to mention every time I do try and cook I can't get my turkey to be anything but dry. This year I chose this lovely restaurant for my families celebration.
Pulling up there was a bit of a line outside but it went fairly quickly. We were seated quickly and our waiter was at our table within seconds.  The restaurant is very beautiful with crystal chandeliers a wonderful view of the city and the holiday decorations just added to it. The Thanksgiving setup here is buffet style and it's separated into 3 areas. First there are sides with some note worthy ones being the pumpkin bisque, cheese tortellini and asparagus. The stuffing was good but the mashed potatoes weren't that great at all. Then there is the carving station with turkey ham and roasted fillet.  All were tender and juicy. Finally there is the dessert area. There were so many options. Tarts, cakes, pies, fruits and more. I tried the cheese cake, pumpkin roll and creme brûlée . They were all great. I wish I could have tried more. I also must mention the service. Our waiter was always present but not over bearing. Never once was I without a drink and empty plates were never on the table for more then a min. He was also great with my son and so were the rest of the staff he interacted with. This might just become a yearly tradition. It was great over all."}
{"text":"Recently held our agency's 35th anniversary gala & fundraiser in their lower dining area. We could not have asked for a better evening and service. 

Our guests had an amazing time and the LeMont staff was incredibly helpful and accommodating in the planning and dining service. Also, you wouldn't think so, but their banquet services are incredibly affordable. 

Of course, one of the best views of Pittsburgh. Having an event or a wedding reception, I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The view was just amazing.
We ordered the Swordfish Monique.. The fish was \"fishy\" and smelt super horrible!
They were kind enough to return it. Everything apart from food was great!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Lemont only two other times for networking events during the day, and this would have been my first dining experience on New Years Eve. We had dinner reservations at 10:00pm. We had to wait in a valet line for about 15 minutes while a police officer directed traffic. It wasn't too inconvenient since we took into account it was NYE. We arrived at 9:55pm, and didn't get seated unit 10:30pm. They kept telling us that our table was still occupied. They seated us at a table in a walkway, and then moved us. It was a lot of shuffling around. The food was good, although my friend found a piece of plastic in her salad. The service, for how upscale this restaurant is, was terrible. We ordered champagne for midnight and it came at 12:15am. There was no countdown to midnight and we almost missed it. It was a great, laid-back atmosphere, but pretty anticlimactic for midnight. Aside from the service and disorganization and chaos, it was fun. I don't think we'd go back here for NYE again though, maybe just a regular dinner."}
{"text":"2 entrees out of 10 were returned. Expensive menu that did NOT measure up to the cost. Staff was friendly but food wise Longhorn Steakhouse would be a better choice. View was amazing and the decor is gorgeous but it looks like no one follows the formal dress code... Show up in a polo t shirt and you'd blend right in with the guests"}
{"text":"Went here twice already.. First time was a few years ago with my big family. Second time was recently for friends 5 years anniversary. Both times were excellent! Food was on point and although some of my friends showed up quite late for the anniversary dinner (and the server seemed very annoyed) throughout the night, service was great nonetheless! 

And of course, we cannot forget about the BEAUTIFUL view this place has to offer! Absolutely wonderful to be here on any night, any occasion."}
{"text":"What an unbelievable view with absolutely wonderful dining. I like to order duck if possible at restaurants, and the duck here was exceptional."}
{"text":"My son and I had dinner here while we were in Pittsburgh to visit CMU.  It was our first time.  Our waiter couldn't have been better.  He is an experienced waiter who made us feel at home from the start.  The food was excellent.  I had the duck, my son had the Steak Diane (cooked tableside).  We know Steak Diane in particular as both of us have cooked this at home many times.  The dish was prepared excellently.  The duck was moist, flavorful with a crispy skin.
I cannot imagine a trip to Pittsburgh without a dinner at Le Mont in our future.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It was a delightful view for our dinner. That being said, it was uncomfortably hot in the restaurant. It was one of the busiest nights of the year, so I can't fault them for the slowish service. The appetizers were incredibly overpriced. The filet was really nice and buttery-smooth, but it didn't have the taste you expect out of a $45 filet. The New York Strip was significantly better. The double-baked potatoes were VERY good. 

TL; DR: you pay for the view."}
{"text":"I hesitated to go after reading some reviews on Yelp - my husband is from Pittsburgh and wanted to take our family to what he remembered as an elegant and special restaurant. I am so glad we listened to him! The view was amazing. The ambiance is spectacular! Our meal was delicious! The entire staff made us feel special from the moment we arrived. It's not modern and trendy - but it is very good and elegant. We saw a lot of multigenerational tables - easy to see why - what a great tradition!"}
{"text":"If someone asked me to describe this place, I'd say \"traditional old rich country club with fantastic views\".  They are known for being a special occasion venue, with an ornate and gilded décor that skews very fancy, formal, and elegant.   The place is actually really pretty even if ornate isn't your style.  They pride themselves on the high class experience and it shows in what they do.  The service is generally very good, albeit a little stuffy.  There isn't a lot of smiling among the staff, particularly in the bar area.  

So why the three star review?   Well...the food.  Just about all of it.  The thing about the Le Mont is that while the traditional elegance is their shtick, it makes for a bland and boring menu in a time where Pittsburgh has tons of more interesting options.  I've been here several times over the years and the food hasn't really changed.  I'm pretty sure I was served those exact same duchess potatoes 20 years ago.  They have added the Celebrations menu to make it a little more accessible (and I think to try and draw in a younger crowd), but that menu is filled with the same old options, plated the same old way.  The consensus at my table the last two times I went was that everything was either under-seasoned or overly sweet...and the menu just seemed very old-fashioned.  I'm not saying they need to go full on modern because it wouldn't really fit with their overall style, but the menu could definitely use a little pizzazz.  

All in all, I'm sure I'll be back - it's an institution after all.  But it's likely to be with my grandparents, who are much more likely to appreciate the menu than I or anyone in my generation is going to."}
{"text":"My friend had her bday dinner here... The reservation was for 830 we didn't get seated till 930 945 ... The food is good but not worth the money the meat inside the banana peppers(veal and angus beef) was over cooked, duck was chewy, salmon was tasteless, creme brûlée was runny but I will say the forty dollar crab cakes were pretty great. No breeding straight lumpy crabmeat! .... Oh and did I mention the view??? That was also great!"}
{"text":"I had really wanted to read past the reviews and like this place, but beyond the view, it did not live up to the owner's dream.  Putting their staff in tuxedos was as uncomfortable for me to see as for them to wear.  There was no pedigree in their training, beyond being polite, but polite is not what a tuxedo wears.  \"What can I get you guys...\"  and the minute a plate was near empty, a tuxedo would reach over you and yank it away.  You had to time your eating.

I had an appetizer of escargot, and although generous in the portion, they were tasteless.  It needed seasoning, garlic, oil, butter, and white wine.
For dinner, I ordered Cavatappi Shrimp Natural.  Again, generous on the shrimp but tasteless.  It was pasta with shrimp. 

My wife ordered a glass of house chardonnay and could not get past the first sip.  I tasted it and it was , honestly, undrinkable and I love finding cheap French wines. We had to get a $85 dollar William Hill Chardonnay to get through dinner.  Seriously ridiculous (400% markup)  My wife ordered their Hearts of iceberg appetizer with the hot bacon vinaigrette but it was so vinegary it was hard to eat and she could not finish it.  For diner she had the Coq au vin, but again--lack of seasoning.

All in all, it was so overpriced and under-delivered.  I felt really bad for the young couple at the adjoining table, hopefully they were overwhelmed with the view to make up for the lack of delight in dinner.  

If this place wants to survive, ditch the tuxedos, lower the prices dramatically and season the food.  The chef needs a pallet for seasoning, or is being held back by the owner.

The place was not very crowded."}
{"text":"Gorgeous view and decor as everyone else said. The food was unimpressive but on par for the price, which was $30 per person at the cheapest with the winter special menu. Of course, given the product I would recommend against ordering the more expensive plates. Simply come here to enjoy the sights."}
{"text":"The LeMont, at one time, may have been the fanciest restaurant in Pittsburgh. However today, it comes nowhere close. The one positive thing I can say about LeMont, is the view of the city is great. The food here is ok at best, but nothing that you'd associate a fine dining restaurant with. Their cocktail and wine list are poor. The decor is gaudy, and far out of date. There are numerous other restaurants in Pittsburgh that top the LeMont, including ones with a great view of the city."}
{"text":"three stars because this is really not a 5 star restaurant.  the locale is great, and the view is phenomenal.  its actually right next to the Duquesne Incline so you can get to the restaurant on the funicular.

but onto the service and the food....
1. eventhough i made reservations for 2 a month in advance for a special occasion, they could not give me a window table.  instead we were seated in a raised area in the back, which wasn't that bad, but wasn't as good as sitting next to the view.  perhaps its because i didn't slip a cool 20 to the maitre d??  another couple came after and got a table setup for 4, which made me curious.
2.  our waiter was friendly, but i have to say from our vantage point, the \"butler\" facade doesn't work.  you can just tell from the minutae of the mannerisms and interaction, and from the level of detail and service you receive.  
3.  the interior is very dated.  its got mirrors, gold trim, old chandeliers, dark carpet, etc.
4.  the food is like hotel or wedding food.  comes in a platter with a metal cover on it.  i know some think this is the way its supposed to be served, but it leaves you thinking that it had gone through a production line and then were kept warm with those covers.  you get the point.  the chicken was dry but the chilean sea bass was good.
5.  the food's presentation looks the same despite your order.  they've got they typical carrots, green beans and smash potatoes on every dish, and worst yet, they're arranged the same on every dish.  see pics i posted.

after paying a bill for dinner for 2, i'm still left wondering where the good food in Pittsburgh are if this is supposed to be at the top of the game.

oh...they have a separate line item on the check for maitre-d tips...bizarre if you ask me."}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because the view is beautiful. Service was horrible and far from elegant. The server addressed my Mom as \"honey\" and argued with her about what went into her drink (a perfect manhattan straight up with a twist)...she was right and he admitted it later. He didn't look to belong in a tux, rather a pair of overalls. The waiters were constantly bantering while walking around the place and boasted about being \"the only unionized waiters\" aka why no one had not yet been able to fire them. 
Food- salads were good (hard to screw up) and French onion soup was good. From there, the food was horrible. Pre prepared mashed potatoes and veggies and flavorless meats. Sea bass was ok but then they smeared cold mango salsa on top straight from the fridge. Chicken Romano tasted like a microwaved slab of frozen chicken and the rolls were served cold and stale. The dessert looked great but even my 4 year old sweet toothed niece didn't take more than one bite. 
At the beginning of dinner, my father told the waiter to give him the check for the meal at the end. When the check came, he asked who it went to and when my dad told him we wanted it he said \"I don't ask but if someone wants to pay it you gotta tell me at the beginning\". 
Save your money- go grab Subway (the service is better) and take it to the incline  building and enjoy the view. 
Truly my worst dining experience to date."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful food and service - never spent so much money on such a terrible experience.  I ordered a Filet MR it was delivered way past medium, no server came back to check, a bus boy came to refill waters and poured water all over our table and my purse, and he never acknowledged or apologized even after we pointed it out. Server completely messed up 3 different things in my parties order - just BAD! I would never recommend this this place. From the start is was an awful experience - the only thing good is the view which you can get from some other much more reasonable and better restaurants on Mt. Washington! I personally wrote the restaurant (in a nice way even) to complain/inform them of their downfalls and never got even a apology in response -  Stay away!"}
{"text":"Great food, Good service, unsurpassed ambiance.  Unfortunately, Staff forgot to serve basket of rolls at the start of dinner service. Host had to request that rolls be served to the guests at the table after the main course was presented. 
     For a high caliber,  fine dining establishment such as the LeMont, this type of oversight cannot be overlooked. 
     Therefore, what could have easily been a dining experience worthy of the coveted 5 STAR rating must now be given only 4 STARS.   
     I will be a return customer.  Hopefully, this rating can be upgraded after a future visit."}
{"text":"If you hate saving money and love extremely mediocre food, then you will love Le Mont. 

We came here for a Valentine's Day dinner. The view is nice but we were stuck near one of the side windows so we ended up having a poor view of the beautiful Downtown Pittsburgh. It was also snowing...but I can't blame wintry Mother Nature. Especially since she visits Pittsburgh so often.

Red Flags:
1- Our waitress, when we asked what the soup of the day was, completely forgot what was in the soup. She stuttered and pulled out a notepad and read it off to us. I would like to think Le Mont would step up their game during V-day weekend. The soup was also a boring vegetable soup. Gag.

2- When my boyfriend ordered crabcakes:
Waitress: You should order a side.
Him: Why?
Waitress: Because this entree is small. It only comes with one side.
Him: Well what's the side?
Waitress: a tomato.

The \"side\" is half a tomato with cheese on top. I got this side too. It was disgusting and undercooked. 

3- Our food. 
I understand that this place is expensive. But I expected at least decent quality food for the price!

Appetizer: $17 - for FOUR pieces of cocktail shrimp in what tasted like jarred marinara sauce. This was especially painful because I bought a pack of cocktail shrimp and sauce for a third of the price at Trader Joe's the week before. 

My lamb: ~$40 dollars. The sauce was nasty and brown and had absolutely no taste. I had to repeatedly put salt and pepper on it. The skin wasn't crisp and had congealed into this thick layer of fat that my teeth couldn't even get through.

Crabcakes: ~$40 dollars. Mediocre, cold, and so boring. There was no presentation. It was literally two blocks of garbage on an empty plate. 

Side: We ordered a side of potatoes because our waitress wouldn't go away until we did. It was DISGUSTING. Even my boyfriend, who loves most potato-y things, couldn't stomach a second bite. It was like a potato gratin, but had been fried and left outside for 5 hours. That garbage was $7. 

Dessert: $7 mediocre slice of cheesecake.

A terrible experience -- I wouldn't pay $20 to eat this kind of food."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to dine at Le Mont for my belated birthday dinner. My birthday is always during winter restaurant week. This was my first restaurant week experience because for whatever reason, we never took advantage of it.

I made reservations via open table about a week in advance. My actual birthday (Friday) didn't have too many reservations left (only 9pm) so we decided on Sunday dinner here. 

I am going to agree with other reviewers and say that you pay for the view. Food and service are okay, but for the hype and (regular) price of entrees, I just expected things to be better. 

I ordered off of the restaurant week menu. Honestly, Le Mont had a good pre fixe compared to other places. I went with the stuffed sole. It was stuffed with crab and almonds.  I got to choose soup or salad (salad) and a dessert (strawberry shortcake). The server assistant brought out bread for us. While appreciated, the bread was oddly very salty.. like pretzel salt. Thankfully the poppy seed bread made up for it. My salad was initially served with the wrong dressing and I had to send it back. 

My boyfriend didn't care for the pre fixe menu ordered from regular dinner menu. He went with the duck. It is marinated In raspberry vinaigrette and cooked. afterwards more vinaigrette is placed on it. The dish was absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it. It put my stuffed sole to shame, lol. 

The sides for our dishes were mashed potatoes and veggies (carrots, asparagus). The mashed potatoes were extremely dry, unseasoned and very bland (think instant mashed potato flakes and water!) It was disappointing. At first I thought they were just slacking since I was using a pre fixe menu, but my boyfriend $45 entrée was served with the same basic potatoes.

My strawberry shortcake was delicious. We also bought a bottle of wine. 

While the view and duck entrée were amazing, everything else was pretty basic, including service. Don't get me wrong, she did an good job, but I guess I was just expecting to be \"wow'd\" more since its a fancier place. The hostess basically ran to seat us at our table instead of kindly asking us how we are doing or making sure we were even caught up with her. (ive been a hostess at chain restaurant and fancy wine bars so I know how to professionally greet & seat guests.. I just expected more courtesy I suppose)

overall the experience was fun, but for the price there are better places out there, especially on Grandview."}
{"text":"It's important to preface this review with two caveats: first, remember that you're in Pittsburgh. Second, understand that largely the restaurant location, not the food, is what you're really aiming to experience. 

That's not to say the food is bad; it isn't! But it's also not extraordinarily creative or adventurous. Each entree is served alongside mashed potatoes and vegetables, and is plated in a similar fashion to the others.

However, there are many good things about this restaurant: the food is good. I enjoyed it tremendously. The service was excellent as well, very attentive and knowledgeable. My steak was prepared perfectly, and the lobster I had was broiled exceptionally well. Oh, and the view - well, it's hard to beat.

If you're looking for a good place for a nice dinner in Pittsburgh, consider giving this place a try. It's not the best, but in the city where people dine out the least in all of America, it passes muster and gets the job done."}
{"text":"Extremely pricey but delicious food and amazing view. Definitely worth trying once. One thing I did find weird though is that our checks all came with two spots to tip - one for our server and another for the maitra d."}

Three berry spinach salad - 4 stars
Cafe de Peris (filet and crab mix) - 2 stars
Pineapples foster - 4 stars
Creme brûlée - 4 stars

Too bad that the entree was a bland 2 stars. Based on its taste, I probably will not return."}
{"text":"Went to Lemont during restaurant week. This was my first time eating at a restaurant on Mt. Washington but it appears that you are paying for the view. The food was good and the restaurant was classy and beautiful but I was not extremely impressed. Our waiter was older and the service was nothing to talk about. My husband ordered steak which was made tableside but it was slightly overcooked and sat for about 10 minutes before any of our food was even served."}
{"text":"My family and I dined at Le Mont last weekend and our experience exceeded all expectations! From the spectacular view, delicious appetizers and entrees, and wonderful service by our waitress Beth, our group couldn't have been happier! Manager Danni was very gracious and checked on our table often to make sure everything was perfect. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great service and great scenery but food was unimpressive and bland. Definitely not worth the price. My wife and I both had fish dishes so maybe it's a steak joint"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Le Mont. I came for a Yelp Elite event. We were given a 3 course meal with wine. For my first course, I had the soup of the day. It was a nice light soup. I also had a poppy seed roll. I love bread, so I loved the roll. 

For my second course, I had the almond crusted salmon. The salmon was very, very delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly, not overcooked and dry like it can often be. It came with a side of mashed potatoes , and steamed mixed vegetables. 

The the dessert course, I ordered the funnel cake. I was excited about the funnel cake, although I did think it was a little of an odd choice for the rest of the menu. Nevertheless, I ordered it because I only get it once a year. Sadly, I wasn't all that thrilled with it. It was very, very hard. Funnel cake is normally soft and pliable. This was hard as a rock. I didn't enjoy it.

The decor is definitely styled for old-money. It's gold and gaudy, but palatable.

The manager mentioned that they have a 3-course special periodically for I believe $33 a person. If you are looking for a good dinner and a great view, I'd recommend Le Mont."}
{"text":"FOOD - Their lamb is fantastic. Everything else was average or above average. I also loved their cocktails, but their lobster bisque was too thick and salty and their stuffed pepper was too plain. The only thing I didnt like about the place was their valentine days menu. Other than then, I was never really unhappy walking out of Le Mont.

SERVICE - Good service! Fast, nice and friendly.

AMBIANCE - very formal. The view is amazing. You should call earlier to reserve a table nearby the window. The whole place looks like 19th century and is very romantic. Its very quiet in there so probably not the best place for kids, but it is a really good place for couples, soon to be couples, families, or for big groups in special events.

OVERALL - Le Mont is probably one of the best restaurants amongst the ones on Mt. Washington(I've been to 5 restaurants on mt washington)."}
{"text":"My wife and I got married here in 1994.  We go back on our anniversary each year (Yes,20+ years).  After this years visit, I simply can't ignore the poor service and overpriced, tasteless entrees any longer.  Ever since this restaurant changed hands years ago (over a decade), it has consistently gone down hill year after year.   Aside from the mushroom soup, our meals were barely edible this time.  Stale cold bread to start.  Had to beg waitress for drinks no service.  Entrees were really really bad.  I had veal.  It was not tender and had what tasted like a bucket of salt on it.  Deserts were fine, but nothing special.  Overpriced even taking the view into consideration.  

I hate writing this review as the most special Day of my life occurred here.  I simply don't know how they can stay in business with quality and services levels consistently this low.  Not sure where our 23rd wedding anniversary will be, but it will no longer be the Le mont

(2nd star is only for nostalgia and memories of what used to be)"}
{"text":"Our family visited Le Mont restaurant during the January 2017 Pittsburgh restaurant week. It's the best restaurant in Mount Washington we have ever visited. The food is the best. The service is great!"}
{"text":"For starters- the view alone is worth a trip inside for dinner, drinks, or a late night appetizer and dessert. Since moving here I've wanted to give this place a try. We visited during restaurant week when the menu is more affordable and just select options are available. I'm extremely glad we gave it a try- it was fun to get dressed up, have an amazing view, and be waited on by some excellent servers. The con for me... the food just isn't that great! We paid a fraction of the price of the normal menu and I still was not close to blown away.  I don't think we will be back but I'm glad to have experienced it once."}
{"text":"Outstanding View and Average Food....

If you are visiting Pittsburgh, everyone will tell you to take the Incline and go up to the Mount Washington area and enjoy the beautiful view of downtown. 

We highly recommend going around sunset and find a table with a view at one of the restaurants on Mount Washington. We reserved a table at Le Mont for 5 PM and got a wonderful table with a view. As the sunset, the view began to change and it was spectacular. 

We ordered a seafood dish for the entree and it was average (in some ways considering the cost, below average). 

But we did have a good time enjoying the view from day time, thru sunset, all the way into the night....."}
{"text":"My review is for their wedding venue services as I recently had my reception at the LeMont and it was truly one of the greatest days of my life.

Prices were comparable to many other locations in the area, which surprised me as I always assumed the view alone would put the venue out of my price range. From the moment I walked into the reception room, I knew it was where I'd have my reception. I love the classy, old school decor and romantic feel to the space. The views cannot be beat and as we were having a good number of out of town guests, I wanted to show off Pittsburgh!

From our first meeting with Bill, the banquet manager, I knew we would be in good hands. His years of experience are evident and he was prompt with responses. There were a number of small details we requested and he always respoded: \"don't worry, I'll take care of it\" (place card table set up, \"his and hers\" whiskey glasses that we wanted to carry in with us at our entrance) - and it all got done! We were able to drop everything off the day before and they took care of the rest; it was so stress free! The set up of our reception exceeded my expectations thanks to the LeMont staff working alongside our other vendors.

Before the reception, the bridal party was able to use the cigar room until we were introduced. We were greeted right away by Bill and a member of the waitstaff, who truly treated us like it was our special day. They brought us all drinks right away and two trays of warm appetizers - the mushroom appetizer was delicious and the men all raved about the mini beef wellingtons and bacon-wrapped scallops. We got to enjoy a good 45 minutes with our bridal party before it was time for us to be introduced; it was so nice to be able to spend that intimate time with our bridal party and gave the men time to finish their celebration cigars! Out guests had a cocktail hour during this time, which must've gone well as everyone seemed energetic for our introductions.

The rest of the evening went off without a hitch - efficient dinner service and everything tasted just as it did for our taste testing. I was very impressed considering they had a packed valentines dining service on the top floor - it felt like we had the place to ourselves! The crab cakes were delicious and I could've eaten a plate of just those! I think our guests enjoyed their food, based on many empty plates. We stopped the bar during dinner and served their house wine instead, which the waitstaff were very prompt in refilling for our thirsty guests ;)

The dance floor was the perfect size and I was so pleased with how many guests were enjoying themselves! The downstairs reception area has a separate bar and sitting area, where we also set up a photo booth and our cookie tables, so our non-dancing guests were able to hang out there and talk. Even with close to 200 guests, I did not feel the space was overcrowded. My one concern with having my reception at the LeMont was that it may be a little \"stuffy\" but it was anything but that - we even extended the reception by an hour because our guests were having so much fun! We are still receiving compliments over a week later!

I could not have imagined a more perfect reception and cannot thank the staff of the LeMont enough for their kindness."}
{"text":"Pros: the view is breath taking, the service is impeccable, and the ambiance is romantic. 
Cons: the food just really isn't that great :(
I attended the Le Mont for the first time recently and was so excited to try out this classic Pittsburgh staple. The staff provided a wonderful experience, but honestly the food was just okay. Really glad I went, but not too sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"3.25 stars. But, I downgrade it to 3 because the care taken in preparing the food (and serving it) did not quite match what I would normally expect from an upscale restaurant like this. We had a very good experience with the scenery and the interior (and our conversation), but it could have been great if Le Mont went the extra mile and put in 100% effort into ingredients instead of building a foundation on iceberg lettuce. The food was basically average, not distinctive, and subpar at times. 

I have always been hesitant to try Le Mont (for the almost 3 years I have been in Pgh) due to somewhat mixed reviews, my fascination with the nearby Isabela which I always thought would be very hard to beat in romance, views, and relatively casual elegance, and, all right I will say it, the \"old money\" hunch I had of the place.  This hesitation was overcome last week when I wanted to treat some distinguished overseas visitors at a nice Mt. Washington eatery -- what place is better than Mt. Washington on a clear day to initiate an out-of-towner to Pittsburgh?

Le Mont is greatly successful in impressing visitors in two ways: outstanding scenery of the city and exquisitely decorated interiors. Sit at a table next to the window and enjoy the view both outside and inside. Deserves 5 stars easily for this. But that is 5 stars just for being at the right location at the right time. A great restaurant should do much more than that. 

The food and service are another story. From an upscale restaurant like Le Mont, I would have expected elegance in the food and ingredients that go into the food. The food was tasty, but it was lacking the fine care that is a staple of *great* restaurants. Let me explain. 

We ordered three appetizers: shrimp cocktail, crepes fontinia, and the oysters. Oysters were subpar, shrimp was not high quality and was served with iceberg like lettuce, crepes were just OK. Nothing was distinctive in the three dishes. The bottle of wine we got was very good, which made me somewhat forget, albeit temporarily, that the appetizers were average. The bread and butter were OK, but only with the cabernet my visitor chose. 

My swordfish entree was the best food I had, and it was actually good. The steak looked good, but I cannot vouch for it. A visitor had bouillabaise, which looked less soupy than what I think it is supposed to be, but he thought it was fine (maybe he was being polite).  

We did go all the way in and got desserts and coffee. I liked the carrot cake with cappuccino, but again nothing was really distinctive. 

Our main server, a gentleman who was clearly seasoned and confident in the art of waiting tables, was somewhat odd. He seemed he was always in a rush and was rough around the edges. I actually appreciated his experience and confidence (and even what could have been perceived as roughness), but I did not care much for the somewhat quick and rough service. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the service; it was fun, but I will for sure not call it elegant. 

To summarize:
+ Outstanding scenery and interiors
+ Good wine
- Average food, not necessarily prepared with great care
o Fun yet not-so-elegant service

Le Mont, thus, has great potential to improve and become an very good restaurant instead of an average one. I will probably give it another try at some point, but I would not take a date I am excited about to Le Mont."}

{"text":"First, I would like to thank YELP and the Le Mont for hosting this lovely event. This was my first visit and somehow I managed to enter through the back door! The staff helped direct me to the lounge. I considered having a drink except the bartenders were preoccupied when I tried to get their attention on a few occasions. 

Our event was held in a private room overlooking the city of Pittsburgh. Unbeatable view! The tables had impeccable settings which included plates emblazoned with the Le Mont name. Our server Dani was knowledgeable with 18 years of experience at the restaurant. 

I enjoyed both the white and red wines presented with our meal. 

The meal was average to me. I had a salad to start with house vinaigrette. As a main course I had the surf and turf. The steak was basic with no flavor and I felt a little embarrassed to ask my server for A1 steak sauce but everyone at the table said at least I didn't ask for ketchup! I would have liked the potatoes to be creamier and more cheesy. They were on the dry side. Half of my vegetables were undercooked while the other half was just right.

For dessert I had the funnel cake with pumpkin latte ice cream. There were 4 of these desserts presented to the table and none of them were plated in the same fashion. The cake was very hard and not a fresh funnel cake. The ice cream and whipped topping were the best part.

Overall it was a lovely evening meeting new people and I enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome view, but the interior and the food is awful. I went here for a work party, (thank god i didn't come here and pay with my own money) and we were served selected items from the menu. My boyfriend and I both got the sea bass and it was literally the worst fish I have ever had dining out.  It was nothing but a semi-warm plain piece of fish with some seeds on top of it. There wasn't even any butter or sauce on it. The vegetables and sides also just tasted like they were boiled.  This was worse than even the banquet food I've had at weddings and other similar events.  The wallpaper was peeling off of the bathroom walls and the place was just ugly inside. The view is awesome, but not worth sitting through the disgusting meal i had.  There are much, much, much better restaurants in Pittsburgh in the same price range or even cheaper."}
{"text":"The view was fantastic. (I mean fantastic!)

The service was great. The waiter and bartender went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed - not always easy when you are eating with a toddler! :) 

Then the food arrives. The soup of the day - Vichyssoise - was good, but unlike any I've ever had before. And that's where, for me, the good food stopped. The strawberry/prosciutto salad that I had was not good. Then, I had a chicken entree. I didn't even eat half. 

Nice evening out, great views, lackluster food."}
{"text":"Two stars for the view.  The lookout is beautiful and a perfect backdrop for a wedding reception.  The food... Well, it wasn't good.  So so bland.  The bread passed around was so so salty.  I couldn't eat it.  Something wasn't right about that bread.  The filet was so tough and tasteless.  They REALLY need to step it up when it comes to the food there.  That being said... I was at a wedding reception so maybe it's better in the dining room?"}
{"text":"I love taking my friends and family to LeMont. The view and food are spectacular and there is no better way to show off the city of Pittsburgh. The staff is always friendly and goes above and beyond expectations. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant on a date with a beautiful and sophisticated woman, so I really wanted to impress.  Parking was a bit of a challenge, but using valet quickly resolved that issue.  Once inside my date and I were immediately captivated by the view of the Pittsburgh skyline-- it is majestic!  BE AWARE--  when dining at Le  Mont. 1) do so in the evening. 2). Try and guarantee a table by the window.   

The restaurant has a very robust menu and wide selection of wines.  My waiter Marco was very courteous and knew exactly when to check on us--  as an ex-waiter I appreciated his professionalism.   My date and I were able to hold a virtually uninterrupted conversation.  

My only issue and reason for not giving place 4 stars.  --the bar area, where my date and sat.  Later in the evening it got very noisy with a somewhat rowdy crowd-- profane language and overall noisiness that really hurt the ambiance of the restaurant.  

I also must say the somewhat pricey menu may be do to the fact that your paying for a whole dining experience not just the food.

I recommend the restaurant but encourage anyone visiting the restaurant to reserve a window table in advance but be sure it is not near the bar area."}
{"text":"I think it's one of the best restaurants in the town. Class and elegance are synonyms of this place. The view is spectacular! Plus, they still have a live entertainment on the weekends. 
I cannot say that menu is too creative or thrilling, but also, I can't complain about the quality. Last time, I had swordfish and it was delicious. Plus, you can ask for substitute or to modify your order. The waiters are professional and attentive. 
Take your date here- it's very romantic ;)"}
{"text":"This place is one of the most overrated restaurants in Pittsburgh. I'm glad to see that this isn't a highly rated spot based on Yelp reviews.  It's stuffy and way overpriced. All you're paying for is the view."}
{"text":"We attended this venue for a wedding and lets say I was so full I didnt eat the breakfast the next day. The venue was also beautiful with a great view.

Pros: 
-The view
-Valet parking
-Friendly Staff
-Food was good
-Drinks were great

Cons
-The filet mignon was over cooked and not the best quality meat
-Communication. When we arrived instead of directing the guests to the correct area they directed everyone to the cash bar because they weren't ready....when the bride and groom had paid for their guests to have open bar. A better option would have been to allow the guests to wait or make it clear that they would be responsible to pay for their drinks at the alternate bar."}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation. First time I called somehow I got hung up on. Second time I called it never connected to a receptionist! I just waited on the phone for 5 minutes then hung up. I'm taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times. The most memorable was when we had our wedding reception here. We had it in the down stairs hall. The ambiance alone is beautiful, so adding your own little touches for your special day only makes it that much better. The bang for your buck is definitely worth it, and they have a variety of packages to choice from, as well as plenty of dishes to choose from. The view of the city, on a clear night, is very romantic for a date night. The dishes are pricey for dinner, but they are good. We have had a variety of their dishes and have yet to complain. Next time we go I will review, in detail, the dishes we have with pics."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal. I had the raspberry duck and it was to die for. They had a live pianist and you overlooked the city of Pittsburgh, very romantic. The servers are dressed in suites. Dress to impress here, formal dining. Reservations are a must."}
{"text":"Came here after a long day at the NPC North American Championships (bodybuilding competition) as a triple date.  All three couples got the chateaubriand for two along with a variety or appetizers and different desserts.

The ambiance, food and service are AMAZING!  I am definitely a fan.  The place is upscale and formal, so lean towards the side of caution and dress either dress casual or formal with a jacket.  The venue is beautifully decorated with a stellar view both inside and outside of Pittsburgh.  There was a live band the night my partner and I were there with friends.  As per the food, from the appetizers to dessert, everything was perfect and down to the dot!  The serving size for appetizers are fair and entrees are generous.

For anyone seeking an intimate night with a loved one, Le Mont is definitely a place to consider."}
{"text":"I have lived in Pittsburgh for 25 years now and somehow I have never made it to Le Mont. Mostly because I have always thought it would be super expensive and didn't think I had a occasion fancy enough to eat there. I finally had the chance to go for a recent Yelp event and I have to say I will definitely be back soon!

Obviously we all know the view from Mt. Washington is amazing but it still blows your mind each and every time you see it. The view from this restaurant is simply breath taking. FYI little tip...press your camera directly up against the glass and you won't get a glare in your photos.

For the event I chose the salmon as my main entree and the creme brûlée for dessert. The salmon was absolutely amazing. Cooked absolutely perfectly and the almond crust on the outside was surprisingly very good with salmon. Something I wouldn't have typically considered pairing with salmon. The creme brûlée was also amazing! As creme brûlée almost always is. The sugar layer on top could have been a little harder like your typical creme brûlée though.

As for the service, it was phenomenal. All of the staff was very tentative and very professional at all times. After my wonderful experience I will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"The snail appetizer was succulent.  The view of the city, beautiful."}
{"text":"Beautiful views but the food was incredibly disappointing.  I wish I could report differently...

After scoping out the restaurant week menus, we decided to try the breathtaking views of the LeMont on Mt. Washington.   Dining there for $35.15 is a steal compared to their $60 Porterhouse.  For half the price our food was half the quality... if that.

Let me say the service was stellar and the ambiance,  though dated, was lovely.  They must have forgot how to cook over the years.

J ordered the Filet medallions medium rare.  What he received was gray meat, no sear, and purple in the middle.  His comment?  Looks like I'm hitting McDonald's on the way home.

A ordered the swordfish that was cooked well done.  Hmm perhaps the dishes were switched?

R had the veal and was underwhelmed at his entrée. 

Me?  Chicken Romano.  Broccoli was yellow, not a steamed green.  The breaded chicken was mush because it was saturated with something.  The potatoes had no seasoning at all.  Pass the salt!  And my chicken was dry... yet coated in moisture. 

Dessert was just as lackluster.  Who serves a creme Brule that isn't bruled?  It looked like last night's leftovers.  

The strawberry shortcake was coated in a strawberry drizzle that tasted like it was fresh from the container at the grocery store... the one that you put in milk and sundaes.

I realize that by offering restaurant week deals, we may not get the LeMont's finest, but we are paying patrons too.  And no, we will not be returning.  Not even for the view.  There are far better restaurants on Mt. Washington who offer views and delicious meals to ALL patrons."}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed with my recent experience at The Le Mont. While the view of Pittsburgh during dinner has to be one of the best, the food in no way my expectations in light of how this restaurant is promoted as a fancier high class place. I don't mind paying more for good food, I just wish the food here was worth the price paid. 

My Caesar salad was soggy with too much dressing. After it was finally served to me, my husband realized it had even sitting on a serving tray behind us for 15 minutes.
This certainly explains the sogginess. My chicken saltimbocca deserves no higher rating than a 2/5. I could easily reproduce it myself, which is not a good sign. It wasn't that it was overcooked, but lacked flavor and had some sort of strange breaded exterior that was hard as a rock. Mashed potatoes were completely dry and bland. The lobster bisque also lacked flavor and contained about 2 pieces of lobster. I think I have had better soup from a can. 

The phenomenal view of Pittsburgh, especially at night, is the only thing that caused me to give this review a 3 instead of a 2 overall. But for me, even the great atmosphere was tainted by a meal which seemed more like an afterthought.

I really wouldn't return here again by my own choice."}
{"text":"I had a 5-star experience here mainly because I came here on a Wednesday night, with a prearranged large party that was able to secure an excellent corner spot with floor to ceiling windows surrounding us on two sides. And also, we came here for restaurant week too so we had a 3-course meal for $30 (pre-tip and alcohol) which was amazing.

The View:
Here's a tip, the best time to come is right before the sun sets. It's like you get two shows for the price of one. The sun reflecting off the 3 rivers is amazing. Here's another tip, choose the seat that faces the window. Or if you brought someone here to impress, have both of you sit perpendicular to the window. Since a picture is a thousand words, check out my photos of the skyline from Lemont.

The Food:
For the reduced price restaurant week menu we still had an amazing selection. I started off with a soup, moved onto Filet Mignon medallions topped with shrimp and dessert was a baked alaska, charred fresh with a blowtorch by our tuxedo-ed waiters right by our tables. Everything I ate was to be expected from a fine dining establishment. Although, I think the restaurant week menu has gone downhill since the time I went back in 2009.

The Service:
Who doesn't want to be served by a man in a tuxedo?! Although my waiter was probably twice my age, he showed no signs of airs and made sure everything was great. Which it was!

Overall, I had a great meal, a great view, and did it all within a very reasonable price. Only downside? I wish I was there with a girl instead."}
{"text":"We ate Thanksgiving Dinner here 11/23/2017 1st sitting. First time ever eating out for Thanksgiving! The restaurant looks the same as it did 30 years ago, gold , glitzy and glamorus. It has been maintained well and very clean, I believe new owners bought it in the past 10 years. It was a buffet. There was a long line, had to wait about 10 min to get to the food. If they could do 2 tables of food it may be better then the last hour just have it on 1 table. Was hard for older people to stand that long and kind of hard to fill and hold 2 plates.
What a treat once you got your food and ate slowly! We got a window seat! What a view! Wonderful! Right in front of the Point in Pittsburgh!
We had an older gentleman for our waiter Bob, very polished, very professional but very nice. His mom lived with him and was home, I asked him to wish her Happy Thanksgiving before we left.
They served the traditional fixings the mashed potatoes were real, the sweet potatoes delicious, stuffing was good too, turkey right off the bone carved in front of you, gravy good. They also had cranberries whole and breadworks breads. They had prime rib our son said it was delicious, salmon, ham, salads, fresh fruit, pasta my husband said was delicious. there were other foods but you can only eat so much!! Deserts were to die for!! All good, homemmade somewhere, fresh. Pumpkin pie, cannolis, spice cake with good not too sweet cream cheese icning and carrot cake, chocolate cake, eclairs danish, you name it they served it. Coffee, tea and soft drinks were included. It was pricey per adult but the view wow! The food delicious! The service excellent! It's ok to splurge on special occassions on excellent quality!"}
{"text":"Wow, talk about overrated. First and last time here. Stopped by the bar side for a hopeful few cocktails/appetizers as recommended by friends. The head female bartender could barely be bothered by us and at least 5 times walked by ignoring us after initial drink order, and it was not very busy. Not until additional male bartender we could order additional drink and food. Opted for the sliders and stuffed mushrooms. The mushrooms were delicious but the \"sliders\" were more like the size of regular burgers with many pieces of bones in them. A disappointing experience, should have gone to Monterrey Bay."}
{"text":"I have nothing but fond memories with friends and family dining at the Le Mont over the years. There's something about this restaurant that makes me feel happy and hopeful, blissful senses that go far beyond the quality of the delicious food. As you gaze upon the beauty of the cityscape while the sounds of elegant music and laughter cascades in the background, you enjoy a masterfully prepared meal with the one(s) you love, and in that moment, you are reminded of how lucky you are to be there. The Le Mont is more than just an expensive meal, it's an experience - a memory - and for everyone, I hope it's a positive one. If you ever have the opportunity to see life from this perspective, regardless of your economical status, do so. I promise, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I visited Le Mont for a wedding. 

Unbeatable view of Pittsburgh- both looking out to the beautiful landscape and looking in at my dear friends deciding to spend forever together. 

Drinks were strong and service was fine.

Quite possibly the worst wedding food I've ever had though, and that's saying something."}
{"text":"The view is great - that's the only thing nice I can say about this restaurant. The decor is faded and outdated. The food is definitely mediocre. My prime rib was overdone and over salted. The vegetables tasted as though they were dumped out of a can. The service was mediocre at best - our water glasses and bread were never refreshed. The staff definitely gave the impression that you were honored to be served by them. WAY overpriced....go to Altius or Vue 412. The food is much better, the service is exemplary, and the view is the same."}
{"text":"The name of this place is simply \"Le Mont.\"  How do I know?  I used to live right next door!  It is an elegant restaurant up on Mt. Washington with an incredible view overlooking the three rivers that the old Steelers Three Rivers Football Stadium was named after:  Ohio, Allegheny & the Monongahela Rivers.  From up here you can see into the new Heinz Field!  Across the rivers is the new Pirates Baseball Stadium and the golden triangle of downtown Pittsburgh and bridge after bridge.  The food is expensive, but worth it and the view is unbelievable.  Be sure you make reservations, because you are not the only person who wants to eat here.  Do it in advance so you can sit by the windows.  Go on a fireworks night . . . or when the Inland Regatta is happening . . . or during football or baseball season.  Ride the tram up from below . . This is the place to be . . . . you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Le Mont for our one year anniversary, being transplants to Pittsburgh and having been informed that this was the most romantic spot in town. The view of the city is delicious, but the view inside is extremely dated. The big, ornate chandeliers and trim on the walls would be fine if it were current, but the place seems a couple decades past it's prime. The service was excellent (very friendly, not pretentious), and the food was pretty good, although very overpriced in the general scheme of things. The maitre'd was quite rude when we intentionally showed up early, and told him we were there but would be taking a pre-dinner cocktail in the bar. His motivations are still unknown to us. All in all, it is probably better to spend this kind of scratch elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best filet I have ever had.  Other dinners and service were great.  Good meeting and conference destination"}
{"text":"I've heard of LeMont and passed it a few times over the years but a Yelp event led me to finally stopping in. Before visiting I assumed LeMont was expensive, small portioned, and super fancy. Two of those things were false as LeMont was fancy as ever. I enjoyed how proactive the staff was and how favorable the food was. While there I had the broccoli cheddar soup which was the perfect way to start my meal and the pumpkin flavored ravioli was surprisingly amazing. The pecans gave it a nice flare. The show stopper here was hands down the funnel cake a'la mode with pumpkin spice ice cream. The funnel cake had a crunchy outside and a fluffy inside. It was the perfect balance of pumpkin and sweetness. The prices are pretty adorable and I will definitely be back in the future. As this is more than dinner with a view but it's an experience."}
{"text":"I had a great time going up to Mt. Washington and experiencing the view from the Le Mont. OMG. What an impressive view, what impressive service, and yum impressive food. I really think that this made me want to come back and honestly I have been telling people all about it since I left. And that $38 dollar special menu. WOWZA you cannot say no to that!

So you walk in and you are surrounded by Christmas trees. And are welcomed by the host right away. You can either check your coat or take it with you. Since I was running a bit late (obviously) I opted to keep my coat with me. I was then escorted to the back area where I was seated. 

The staff was so fast and efficient. The manager Dani who has been there for over 18 years told us that the staff have been there, some, over 30! That is crazy but these people really knew what they were doing. The table was beautifully decorated and had white and red wine already poured. The bread then was brought to the table and it was a basket of different types of bread. Yum. 

Main Course:
I started with a garden salad with the house dressing. The dressing was very good and it wasn't overly poured as to soak the lettuce. I was happy that they went light on the dressing so I could enjoy the meal. The salad was nice and a good little starter.

Then I enjoyed the surf and turf. I mean I licked my plate clean. The steak was done so tenderly that I didn't even need to use a knife if I didn't want. The turf was two jumbo shrimps that were skewered and buttered. The plate had a side of buttered goodness in a little dish that could be used to dip in the shrimp or the mashed potatoes. Now, those mashed potatoes.... They were fluffy and made into a little mountain. You almost didn't want to eat them since they were so pretty. The other side was then some broccolini and some other mixed veggies. It was really good and I ate everything on my plate. The plate was seasoned to perfection and nothing about it was bad. 

Dessert:
I got the creme brulee for the dessert portion of my meal. I will say that aesthetically it was very pleasing but the brulee was not like anything I have ever tried. Brulee is my favorite dessert so I have tried it a lot of times. This one did not have the crunch that most brulee has. It was more sugary at the top, like it was not flamed enough for the crust to form. It was still good, totally yummy, but not like I was thinking it would be. 

Overall, I love it. I want to go back and I want to try more of the menu. I think that this place really could be a fun place to go and I look forward to bringing some people the next time I want to go out to Mt. Washington."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places to dine. I love the opulent décor, incredible view, classic menu and the high level of service. 
Tonight's visit to Le Mont for my Birthday celebration has me feeling a little disappointed, and  I certainly hope the management can fix these few minor things and bring the 
dining experience back to  5 stars.
  The first thing I noticed when I arrived was the lighting on the stairs from the entranceway to the dining level. It is only a couple of short steps, but they are very wide.
The lighting under the steps looks to be a bargain basement LED strip lighting that was obviously incorrectly installed. It was hanging down, shining in the customers faces and the color was all wrong. It was a bright white LED hue that would be used in Walmart or in a basement workshop. I cannot believe that the management actually accepted this light installation from the get go. It may seem like a small detail, but it completely destroys the initial mood when you arrive. I have included a photo.

  The Le Mont salad was very tasty, except the dressing was a bit sharp. My Pork Chop, while tender and very lean, was rather bland. The cherry / apple glaze did not penetrate the meat enough to give it any deep flavor. Risotto was excellent as well as the vegetables. My dining companions meals looked and I was told were excellent, they ordered the Scallops and the prime rib.

We ordered the Cherries jubilee, which was excellent, but I noticed that the server preparing the dish tableside opened a sugar packet to sweeten the sauce. I would have expected a small ramekin of the required sugar to be on the tray, not a  5 cent sugar packet. Very tacky.

A few other small issues were that the live band was a bit too loud for fine dining, the wallpaper in the men's room upstairs was peeling, the print on the menu was too small for such a dimly lit area and those lights on the entrance stairs... my god ...simply unacceptable.
  My opinion is that it's still a great place to dine, but some of the edges are getting a bit rough. It is the small things that add up to make the whole experience complete."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Lemont in many a year!  Always liked the food and service was impeccable!   Well it hasn't changed!

The maitre'd showed our small group to a great table in the corner.  Yes!, what a great view!  Had reservations for a friends birthday...special occasion.  Fun to watch boats on the river, the incline and planes flying over the Northside..oh excuse me, it is now the North Shore.  We did go mid-week so it was not crowded.

We had a few kids, ages 11 to 14, and the maitre'd and server were so good at making sure they could order just about anything they wanted.  They had a long list of ideas not on the menu, since everything is made to order.  Fantastic!  Server went way above and beyond, like you would expect at a top notch restaurant.

The tables were so sweet!  Shiny table ware and glasses.  Fancy plates and linens, it is nice to dine out.  We ordered some Champagne to start off and waiter made sure to ask about the type we preferred, Brut, Asti or semi???  Great job!

Server also suggested we not over order apps, and extras and told us about the roasted tomato that came with our meal.  Started with a couple of apps, escargot alio was so nice with garlic, not seen much anymore but fun to see the kids try!  The crepes fontinia were delicious.

Had a classic, the Lemont salad, nice fresh greens served with the Lemont vinaigrete, really enjoyable.  

The meal came with assorted fresh bread and was refilled when needed.

Had the Veal loin rib chop for two that was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet.  Others had the salmon, New York Strip steak and a special kids spaghetti. Everyone loved their meals and how they were cooked. Managed to get a bite of the spaghetti when the young one next to me keep saying this is better than grandmom's.  It was very good indeed.

When you go you have to try the deserts.  We decided to get a couple of the old tried and true cooked tableside so the kids, big kids too, could watch and try deserts they have never seen.  The Baked Alaska and Bananas Foster were sweet and very good, as was the coconut cake.  Deserts were passed around and the Bananas were the fav.

Lemont can be a little pricey if you order extras, but not to bad if you stick to the basics, but  you get really good food and service.  This is a top notch place during the week.  

What a great experience!"}
{"text":"Chandeliers and men in tuxedos, do not equal 'good food'. 
The dishes tasted like the most basic catered wedding food. I imagine the cook only knows of two seasonings, salt and pepper; both were used sparingly. The dessert tray resembled cakes from a diner display case, not the expensively priced sugar prizes they were purported to be. Good place for grandparents or anyone who considers mini gerkins on toothpicks to be the height of sophistication."}
{"text":"We went here for our honeymoon on Sunday night. I'm not sure if they have altered things since their current poor reviews. We were accommodated as we changed our reservation time twice. We arrived ten minutes early, and we're immediately seated. Danny seated us and was very pleasant. Our server Mike was easy to find throughout the evening, and very entertaining. Maybe people think it's slow because they finished our courses table side. We ordered Caesar salad,  chateaubriand for two, and bananas foster. All were superb!"}
{"text":"The LeMont is great for celebrating special occasions. Yes its expensive, but for a special occasion its worth it! Delicious menu, good portion sizes and quality buffet dinners. Spectacular view- maybe even the best in the city! There are lots of window seats too! Nice cocktail selection, each made with high quality ingredients and nicely balanced. With a view like that and the ornate decor, your celebrating your special occasion in style!"}
{"text":"We had something to celebrate so where else would we go in Pittsburgh? The atmosphere lends to the celebration and made my sister feel so special for graduating college. It's the perfect place to go to welcome her to the adult world. But my 17-month old son wasn't out of place, which isn't what I expected! The staff was very friendly to him and there was a changing table in the bathroom for him, plus a high chair. 

I had the veal and shrimp Romano piccata and it was delicious. The rest of the party had the filet mignon and one person had the crab cakes. Everyone loved their meals. I also had the table side ceased salad which felt decadent. And speaking of, the carrot cake for dessert was a perfect end to my meal. 

I was happy that we were seated by the window bc duh, that's what we were there for. The view was just out of this world, of course. 

I do wish the valet pulled right up to the door at the end of the night. This might seem stupid to complain, but why should I cross the street to get the car as it pulls out of the parking lot? I could have done that myself without paying $6 + tip."}
{"text":"Attended a gala last night downstairs. There was this woman working and she went out of her way to make sure I had a plant friendly meal. She was so friendly and quickly took it upon herself to help me out. They brought me a steaming plate of yummy freshly steamed veggies. They were super yummy and I couldn't have been happier!"}
{"text":"Wow, the views from Le Mont are truly breathtaking. I came for an event recently and the room had floor to ceiling windows with a beautiful view of Pittsburgh. We were started with salad and bread. For the main course, I had the chicken bruschetta with potatoes and green beans. The chicken was breaded with a balsamic vinaigrette sauce. The service was excellent as well. The event was held to the left of the main dining room and was very spacious. There was room to walk around and mingle and there was a dance floor as well. The whole restaurant has a very grand feeling to it. Even as someone from Pittsburgh, I still appreciated the views!"}
{"text":"Growing up a Yinzer, I always thought that the Le Mont was too pricey an'nat just to see a view of dawntawn Pixburg.  Well say hello to the Le Mont fixed price menu (or as they say the \"prix-fixe menu\").  For $50, yes $50, you get two main dishes and two-side salads.  This special coincides with the restaurant celebrating 50 years of service.  True, as prior reviewers have stated, the place does feel a little like a high-class place from the eighties but if you order off this menu, you will definitely get your monies worth and have a very nice experience.

Atmosphere - Think fancy restaurant from any 1980's movie where someone creates a scene and everyone is shocked...saying things like \"oh, my\".  

Service - Friendly, prompt, first rate.

Food - I ordered from the prix-fixe menu and ordered the...actually, I forget the exact name of the dish...but it was the one with two 4 oz fillets.  They have several other choices including fish.  It, my fillets, were prepared as ordered, medium, and they were delicious even with a brown sauce drizzled on top.  Oh, the darn French and their nonstop use of sauces make for watching your weight difficult.  The Lemont salad that was part of the meal deal was basic and good as were the accompanying breads.  For dessert, I had the coconut custard cake, which was also very good and moist!   

Price - Um,...$50 for two.  Where they get you is on the dessert and drinks.  The dessert was $7 and drinks are priced at restaurant drink rates...yeah known...expensive.  Although they do have a list of select wines at $25 a bottle, which can work well on a budget.  

Overall - I think with this promo, the Le Mont is one of the best deals in town.  So, go check it out an'nat.

Note: I went on a weekday, not positive if the prix-fixe menu is available on weekends."}
{"text":"Ambience is Fabulous. We ordered off the 50 year anniversary menu and both dinners were disappointing. Our waiter gave us complimentary desserts. We danced, that was special. We will be back but we will not order off the anniversary menu."}
{"text":"We had a gift card to Le Mont but didn't get to go there until the day before the expiration. Whoops. Made a reservation for 8pm on a Friday night. Rolled up to the front and got our car parked through the valet. When we entered, you could feel the opulence reeking out from the decor but in an old school way. The host was kind but unfortunately sandwiched us into this corner in between two large parties. The view was fantastic though. We were served bread and the candle was lit on our table but then because of where we were located, blending in with the two parties, we had to wave down a waitstaff for a menu after twenty minutes. They apologized profusely and offered a glass of wine on the house. This was kind of them though I was not impressed with their wine menu. I am not a wine expert at all but when you've got Sutter Home at $8 per glass it does make me wonder... I ordered a caesar salad to start which was made table side and then had the raspberry duck. Both were delicious and they redeemed themselves on the starter and entree. Then we ordered bananas foster for dessert which was made table side like the salad and the portion was huge but very delicious. I wish I had more room to eat it! These too were on the house because of the delay that we experienced. All in all the food was good and the wait staff were great but the style of Le Mont was just not me so I probably would not come back unless there was a specific reason."}
{"text":"The view, while spectacular, could never aspire to compensate for the horrendously expensive and bland food. The salmon was overcooked and they even managed to botch the chicken. The accompanying side carrots and green beans were a cruel joke. 2 stars for the service and decor, but they should seriously rethink their kitchen."}
{"text":"Le Mont just lost $30,000 tonight.

Me, my fiancé, and her mother went to Le Mont for dinner tonight in hopes of locking down a date for our wedding venue next year. Well, I definitely would have thrown my money at them if I wanted countless disappointing memories and an over the top, pretentious, unprofessional, outdated venue.

Le Mont reminds me of a restaurant that made it big in the past with presumably good food, service, and professionalism while of course being complemented by the unmatched view of Pittsburgh. However, complacency must have set in because all of those characteristics were lost along the way.

Upon arrival, we were not greeted with even a hello. We were standing waiting for our table while one of the staff members motioned over to us (while standing deep within the restaurant) to come follow him. If it wasn't for my fiancé paying attention his efforts would have been useless, while remaining devoid of professionalism.

Our waitor clearly lacked proper training for a place of this caliber. Nothing against him, but if you work hard during the week to go to a restaurant and pay hundreds of dollars for dinner, you would like a waitor that is professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. For example, he asked me if I would like another cocktail as it was 3/4 finished. I said yes as I proceeded to finish it; meanwhile he waited behind me as I finished the drink and said: \"Oh I'm just waiting for you to finish so I can make you another drink in the same glass.\" WHAT!??!!?

I ordered the filet mignon and said I wanted it between medium and medium rare. His response: \"Well I'll just have them cook it medium rare and if it's undercooked for you I'll have them cook it a little bit more.\" WHAT!??!!

The side vegetables were 100% frozen and just came out of the microwave, and lacked any effort of seasoning to help disguise its origin, the grocery store shelf.

When it was time for dessert, they brought out a food cart of half eaten cakes that looked like they had been raided by a hungry pack of wolves. But, in any attempt to salvage the night, me and my fiancés mother ordered a slice of cake. The waitor asked my fiance if she wanted anything and she said no because she was full. His response: \"You sure you don't want nuttin?\" WHAT!??! 

I ordered a cappuccino which lacked foam and had burnt coffee inside. To top it off, the plate was \"beautifully garnished\" with a shriveled, small, dirty, lemon peel. \"Yes, I love lemon with my coffee.\" When I confronted the waitor about it, he indeed confirmed that it was a garnish. WHAT?!?!?!?!!? 

The bathrooms were dirty, floors were sticky, wall paper was peeling, and outdated. On the way out, no \"have a good night, thank you for coming, etc\" was said. Pretty fitting though - with this poor excuse for a 5 star restaurant I would expect nothing more: lack of professionalism, mediocre precooked food, and ridiculous comments about lemon peels, but definite willingness to take your money.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT. IT NEEDS GORDON RAMSEY, OR A BULLDOZER. SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ELSEWHERE.

JUST GOOGLE THE VIEW."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place really sets the tone for a great gastronomic experience. The tall ceilings, crown moulding, beautiful chandeliers and opulent environment was just beautiful. The prix fix menu was very generous for the price point. The cocktail menu was great. The cucumber martini was delicious and satisfying. The veal roulade was beautiful. The seafood it was filled with was impressive but a bit poorly executed. Several of the shellfish were not prepped well. For instance the shrimp still had shells on. I wouldn't expect to find that in a roulade. The flavor was good. The roasted pepper tomato soup was delicious. The Caesar salad was perfect! The rib eye was cooked one level higher than what I ordered but was still very tender and juicy. If ordering steak, order one level less cooked than what you fancy and you will get what you want. The fruit/vinegar compote on top of the steak was absolutely unnecessary. It totally violated the beauty of that steak. On its own, it was a delicious accompaniment but smothering the steak with it was just wrong. The table side foster dessert was a great display of showmanship on the part of our waitress who was also very good. Overall this was a memorable experience and I definitely will consider coming back here the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We came here for Easter brunch and I was expecting a lot. I've grown up with everyone in the area talking about how great and fancy the Le Mont is. Well, I'll tell you this much.. Never go to this over priced brunch Buffett. We had terrible service from some some gentleman and we were left with empty drinks and trying to figure out where the buffet stations were. The food was cold on the buffet even! The best part was the cheesecake, that was delicious. The view is gorgeous as well, but you can get that for free from the Mt Washington lookouts. Maybe their regular meals are better, but I have no desire to even try."}
{"text":"Went to the LeMont years ago and it was great. Went back again to treat my parents for their anniversary. We had booked a table for 4 at a window at 6 pm. We had a table in the central part of the restaurant  and had to wait until 7 to be seated. The guy that seated us said that I must have forgotten to request a window seat and was rather condescending.  The food tasted like pre-made food from a freezer. I knew it would be expensive but the quality was so bad. I recently went back because a friend insisted and it was like no time had ever past. The food was terrible and cold in an uneven way like it was microwaved and tasted so bland. Go up the incline and then go somewhere else better, like McDs for food. The only thing that was good was my desert."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers and say that you pay for the view here but also the food. I think the food is absolutely yummy! I came here for the PRISM international student ministry dinner tonight and my oh my, the balsamic chicken and veggies were divine. The waiters and waitresses here act a bit annoyed at their jobs, so I also agree that the service is so-so. I think they might have a better time watching paint dry.....but anyhoo. 

On to the dessert: imagine a perfectly round ball of ice cream dipped in the perfect amount of crushed oreo crumbs that cover every square inch of the ice cream. Now top that with fudge. Dangit, you got yourself a deal. Every eye at the table bulged with fattened glory at this heavenly sweet. I want another oreo ball right now.

Also, not only did we get to see the perfect spring evening but topped off the night with an amazing lightning show with heavy rain shower. Can't beat that view of the city!"}
{"text":"They out did themselves tonight I had the pork chop with an apple walnut glaze, that was delicious the wait staff was on point, with just enough to know when to come by and when to wait until I was ready.. It's always a pleasure to come here.."}
{"text":"We dined here with some trepidation due to what previous reviewers had posted.  But we were visiting someone who really wanted the experience, so we reserved a table and prepared ourselves to enjoy the view but to be disappointed in the meal.

We were wrong.  Le Mont's view is,to be sure, the best you will find of downtown Pittsburgh and its waterfront at night, but the food also stands on its own merits. Our group dined on steak and lamb, and all were pleased with their fare.  Entrees were all cooked as ordered and the vegetable accompanyments were all fresh, cooked to showcase the taste of the vegetable (Carrots and asparagus), and presented in a well-plated manner.

Salads all came out well, with fresh greens enhanced (not smothered) by the dressings.  Dessert and coffee satisfied as well.

We give five stars for the view, four stars for the excellent service from Maitre d' and wait staff, and the food gets a solid three stars which probably should have been four stars if we could have tasted some of the dishes we did not order that wes aw coming our from the kitchen.

Live caberet music enhanced our evening.  Valet parking was easyand worth the charge.

Having come in with a skeptical mind, we all left very satisfied.  We will dine here again."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the years for dinners, parties and other events. I'm a freelance journalist and a magazine I wrote for held a launch party here. The most incredible things are the views of the city and the interior. Simply spectacular. What's not so spectacular is the food and at times the service. It's kinda joe the Grand Concourse is now. Sometimes the food is fantastic sometimes it's bland. Sometimes service is good and sometimes it's not. These types of places don't really seem to change to keep up with the times."}
{"text":"The LeMont on top of Mt.Washington overlooking the city has a charming atmosphere where you can spend several hours enjoying a delicious dinner. The staff is friendly and makes every attempt to make your evening special. Marco is a waiter extraordinaire. Perhaps the best in the business! The view of the city is fantastic, especially after sundown."}
{"text":"What a glamorous view of Pittsburgh!  I came here with a Party of 10 to celebrate a friends birthday we had made reservations for.  

Restaurant: The restaurant itself was bustling and busy as it was holiday party season.  Yes it's dated glam but still very glam, classic Victorian even...I really find anything wrong with it like other posters.  

Food: Anyone coming here should expect to overpay for your meal, so no shockers there.  Get the French Onion Soup, cream of the crop there!  A few of us ordered the Filet Steaks that ordinary come wrapped in bacon but every single person at our table who ordered specified no bacon.  Come entree time, a few didn't have bacon but a few did so we had to send them back.  You could also tell they just unwrapped the bacon from the steak and returned it to us, not actually preparing a new Filet.  Furthermore my Filet was requested Medium and it arrived Medium Rare.  By the time I sent it back and they recooked it, we were serving cake so I didn't eat it. A disappointment for a restaurant of this class.  

Service: For a high class establishment, I would suggest the male server not hit on guests, even kindly....that's just not professional.  Our main female server was very kind even though you could tell it was a very busy night for her.  She should have payed closer attention to the dietary restrictions of the group though.

Come back? - Eh its worth going to, maybe again next year."}
{"text":"Le Mont or should I say \"the le mont\" like my yinzer brethren is what you would expect it to be if you are from this town.  Now, if you are from out of town it is truly one of he most beautiful vistas you can see whlle dining in any city.  I've eaten here maybe a dozen times and a few years ago hosted about 30 nights while presenting seminars.  As an aside this is a good spot for business functions because it has good name recognition, professional staff and a restaurant manager who will negotiate costs.  Anyways, I was here again on Monday and the fact that we were there probably dropped the average age a few decades, which is fine.  This is definitely the kind of place your parents and grandparents would like.   It was a Monday and at first when we were cocktailing at the bar seemed relatively empty, but actually to my surprise filled up through the evening with elegant gents and ladies wearing there sunday or monday best'.  The restaurant itself is classically elegant.  BIg beautiful chandeliers, lots of ornate woodwork and crystal, bold colors and a baby grand' elevated above the dance floor.  After a guinness (bonus) at the bar we were seated at a big table right on the glass.  The view was sublime, however there were a few dead flies on the inside ledge a few inches from where we were seated.  The waiter was there quickly to get our drink orders and explain the features.  He was a professional server and was pretty much spot on from start to finish.  The features of course, were seafood (restaurant trying to clear out leftover seafood from the weekend) there was a platter with lobster tail, coquille, and a few other items.  I didn't try it, but Garrett and Tom said it was good, I'm sure the quality wasn't that great, but it was a large portion.  We started with a few apps'.  They were calamari (nothing special, overpriced at $13), also the brie (chambord brie stuffed with apricots, apples and pecans finished with an apple glaze).  This was pretty delish, but at $14 again a bit high and the final app' was oysters bienville (oysters topped with asiago, crab and spinach).  This was okay, but again the same theme here overpriced for quality.  A few folks had the ceaser salad which was fun because it was prepared tableside.  I was told it was very good.  Megan got some chicken dish with pineapple.  It looked pretty good and not dry.  Tom and Keith had some type of preperation of veal, which they both said was excellent served with perfectly cooked root vegetables and mashed potatoes.  Matt had the steak diane, which is fun again because it's two small filets prepared tableside with a nice demi-glaze.  I had the lamb which were several small lamb chops lightly breaded with a mustard type glaze and breading.  It was okay and I will admit I ate all of it, however it was a bit more \"gamey\" than it should have been.  There were several desserts sampled and most were palatable.  Megan tried some coffee at the end, however the cream was spoiled.  THe waiter quickly replaced.  This is a place you should take out of town guests, however if it's my \"dime\", which it usually isn't when I'm here you can do better elsewhere.  You are easily paying a 20% premium for the view and it is pretty much the opposite of \"hip or trendy\", which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The service is 4 stars, the food 2 stars or less because of price, but the view is 5 stars.  Go at least once and sadly that's probably enough."}
{"text":"I just got married at The Le Mont in March and they did a fantastic job! Bill is awesome and does an outstanding job to accommodate. I went with The Le Mont because I used to be a wedding planner in Pittsburgh before moving to the west coast and I trust them every time! They are like a well oiled machine of caterers and staff. All the times I have worked the venues I have seem the same people event after event. They know what they are doing and how to make a wedding run smoothly! 
The food was fantastic and the view is unbeatable! I wish I could do it all over again :)"}
{"text":"The perfect spot for an elegant night. Wonderful view, decedent food, kind staff. The wine list was well curated but I wasn't a fan of it being printed on orange paper. I realize that's extremely picky. It was a perfect experience and we will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I love the view, and the atmosphere at the Le Mont. The restaurant is just simply beautiful especially decorated for the holidays.  The Autumn celebration menu is such an amazing deal.  I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup, butternut pumpkin ravioli, and the funnel cake with pumpkin ice cream.  Its a steal for $38, and a lot of food. The ravioli is the best I've ever had and I highly recommend this dish. Also, the restaurant was very clean and the service was great.  We will be back for sure to try something off the Winter celebration menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Family favorite.  Amazing meals. Provides patrons with distinctly different evenings that cater to individual needs. From romantic evenings- to family meals with young children- to business dinners- to specialized events- it's always a superb experience . The staff is fantastic yet warm. True representatives of the personality of this city. 

I'm partial to eating in the dining room for a slow multi course meal. However, the lounge options are a nice way to relax and grab some casual bites. Often the space has live music. Easily, a couple can relax and enjoy a night in the Lounge spending about $50., yet feel like the bill should have been much higher. A real deal considering the quality of items served.  

Overall, you get much more than you pay for. Yes, it's far from inexpensive however they always hit their mark and offer more than I anticipate. 

Best tip- don't overlook the vegetable streusel.  Fabulous. Also- share your food preferences. Staff makes suggestions and tweaks any menu item to suite your tastes.

One important thing- don't forget to save room for dessert. Cutting back on amazing salads and soups, then entrees that melt in your mouth is difficult. The desserts and after dinner coffee's, they shouldn't be missed."}
