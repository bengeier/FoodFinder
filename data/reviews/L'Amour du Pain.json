{"text":"Great little place with super friendly staff. 
They have many breads and pastries. 
Also small quiche and a yogurt chia parfait among other things. 
Good coffee and an airy pleasant place to eat. 
We had quiche , ham and cheese sandwich croissants and other treats. 
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great little spot I happened upon while walking through this up and coming neighborhood. Had a wonderful warmed-up traditional French sandwich paired with an eclair. Lots of baked goods to choose from, so I added a brownie for my plane ride home to Iowa. Coffee on nitro was an added plus for cold-brew fans!"}
{"text":"So delish. Sandwiches and sweets. Coffee. Wifi. Outlets. Air conditioning on a hot day. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"The bread is really good and fresh. I've never eaten in there, but the ambiance is great. Only drawback is that the menu is small."}
{"text":"How did I not go to this bakery sooner?  It's so close to us but I've been obsessed with another neighborhood spot. Stopped by to pick up some sandwiches and treats to go to a nearby park. I will definitely return to enjoy the space. Lots of natural light and seems like a good space to do some work.  Kinda small though so finding a seat might be a problem.

Croissant sandwich was great. Also enjoyed their turkey sandwich which was on a softer bread (maybe brioche?) so totally kid friendly. I like how their chocolate croissants actually look like regular croissants, except with alternating cocoa stripes/rings around them.  And their latte was great. I would have like a little more foam on top but it was strong and smooth."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The staff is very friendly and I love their mokas!  Also I get a chocolatine whenever I come in.  Yumm!  Their baguettes are also amazing!"}
{"text":"On vous dit bonjour dès l'ouverture de la porte, le service est attentif et convivial. 2 caisses permettent de prendre les commandes rapidement. Super standing pour la déco et les matériaux. Petite ambiance sonore. Prix sur le top mais va complètement avec la qualité. Le pulled porc sandwich à la sauce tomate est incroyable ainsi que le pain à l'érable.

Wi fi gratuit. Expresso à améliorer absoluement pour le prix prohibitif de presque 4$. Le simple court est clairement un double. La qualité du grain est largement en dessous de la moyenne  où les bons cafés afusent dans la ville ! Ça goûtait le pas très frais. Le distributeur d'eau a un arrière goût : /. Besoin de la changer plus régulièrement ou de le laver ? Donc un presque 5 étoiles. Le croissant au chocolat manque d'un peu de beurre et est trop noyé dans le chocolat. L'éclair au chocolat chantilly est léger mais la crême chantilly un peu moins par contre.

Accessoirement, les toilettes sont d'une propreté irréprochable et ça fait toujours plaisir."}
{"text":"There are lots of bakeries in Montreal and the competition is very high when it comes to good quality of products while maintaining competitive prices.
L'Amour du pain opened few months ago in that area, and I would recommend it. I tried all their croissants and my favorite are the almond and chocolatine. In my opinion, a good bakery will make you come back for their croissant nature/plain. This isn't the case.
They do not have a proper coffee machine. So don't  expect a good fresh coffee. 
I once tried a tarte au citron, wasn't my favorite.
They also sell pizza dough, but you will need to order it ahead of time as quantities are limited.
The bakery is neat and service is good."}
{"text":"Petit spot fenestré pour prendre pause café , thé ou patisserie, petit comptoir avec grand fenetre pour se distraire et voir le monde passer :)"}
