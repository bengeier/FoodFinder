{"text":"The restaurant manager was very look at me look at my restaurant we have a market blah blah. The food was very expected let's say. Like olives ? You will taste it in your mouth the rest of the day. I would say pass on by and try another restaurant downtown instead. May look like lots of room in the resultant as just went through renovations. But I don't think they will ever see every table used. I can't see them lasting a year. Once the hype of a (new) restaurant is over so will they."}
{"text":"We went to Parm to try something new, and were not disappointed. The menu is fairly limited (intentional), but everything we tried was good. From the calamari appetizer to the pizza with arugula and prosciutto, through to the spaghetti and meatballs - they were all worth ordering. The service was excellent and helpful. We were surprised that the restaurant was not more full, but will chalk it up to being reasonably new. The value was excellent as we had drinks (2), a soft drink, 2 appetizers and 2 mains for three of us (plenty) and all in, including tip, was $80."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this new restaurant by Lucille's.  It opened on July 3rd so we gave it 2 weeks to get the bugs out of the operation.  The four of us decided that we should have waited longer...

We booked online with Bookenda and received a call the day of our reservation, a Friday night, to confirm.  We arrived at 7pm and were immediately seated upstairs.  The interior of the restaurant hasn't been updated much since the days of Lea, however it was refreshed nicely and looked very inviting.  First problem, the music was so loud that we could barely hear the hostess speak to us once we left the front door.  There were only a few tables occupied when we sat down, however it quickly filled up.

Looking at the menu I was a bit disappointed with the overall selection.  This is an \"Italian\" restaurant and there are 3 or 4 pastas on the menu, seafood and steaks.  The waiter finally came over, 10 minutes after sitting, and was telling us about the specials, which there weren't any, and we had to ask him to speak louder since the music was so loud.  We asked about the salads and he told us there where small, holding up his hands to represent the size of the plate, about 6\".  Hmmm, $16 for a Cesar Salad that wasn't large enough to share?  $21 for an heirloom tomato salad.  

Looking further into the menu I got excited to see Chicken and Veal Parmesan...wow $34 and $48.  NY Strip $54.  Getting over sticker shock, they call themselves a family style moderate priced restaurant, we decided on our dinners. My son ordered the Orecchiette Pasta, shaped like little ears with Lamb, my other son ordered the Chicken Parm, my wife opted for a cesar salad and an appetizer meatball, $16 by the way, and I had their Seafood Bucatini.  My wife and I also had a glass of wine, only 3 whites and 4 reds to choose from.  The entire wine list had 30 plus of each so we were disappointed by the \"by the glass\" selection.

The food came out surprisingly fast considering the restaurant was full at this point.  The food was presented nicely and looked fantastic.  The cesar salad was in a 6\" bowl and was piled about 6\" high...plenty large enough to share...just very hard to eat since it was stacked like a game of Jenga.  We asked for crushed red pepper for our pasta...\"we don't have any, only these spicy pimento pepper things\".  We asked for parmesan cheese...he never brought any.  The Orecchiette looked fantastic....oops....no Lamb.  After about 10 minutes trying to flag down the waiter, he had 4 more tables he was serving and/or taking orders, we asked about the Lamb and he said there was shredded lamb on it...but acknowledged that it appears not the be there.  We also asked about our missing meatball...he said he would let his manager know.  20 minutes later the manager came by to let us know that they forgot to put the lamb on the dish...2 minutes later the Orecchiette reappeared with Lamb...5 minutes after that the meatball finally arrived.   Now that we all had our meals we all tried each others to get a feeling for the food.  The Seafood Bucatini had a lemon zest flavor to it, nice but a bit overpowering.  The seafood was 2 shrimp and 6 \"mini clams\", about 1\" in size, cute..but not very meaty.  The pasta was cooked nicely, could have used some crushed red pepper for some heat.  The Chicken Parm was actually a FULL breast over angel hair pasta.  The chicken was cooked nicely, the pasta was mushy, overcooked, and the tomato sauce was exactly that, tomato sauce...didn't seem to have any spices etc.  Cutting the four basil leaves up added nice flavor to the otherwise boring sauce.  The Orecchiette Pasta was actually the favorite of the group, the shredded meat added a nice flavor.  Not sure what the cheese on it was but it too had a strong hint of lemon to it.  Once again, crushed red pepper would have been a welcome add on.  The meatball, about 4\" in size was mushy, I actually thought it wasn't cooked, but it was.  The marinara that was on it would have been nice on the chicken parm.  Overall the food was OK to good.  

There was one dessert that was offered, we opted to get ice cream elsewhere.  We had 3 main dishes, a salad, appetizer (meatball) and two glasses of wine.  This all came to $200 plus tip.  I would not call this a moderately priced restaurant.  If we had all had salads and mains we would have been $265+, pricey!

Overall I would have to say I was very disappointed with our new \"Italian\", if you can call it that, Restaurant.  We need to give it a few months to get \"into the groove\".  My biggest disappointment is the cost, I think the only mains under $32 were 2 or three of the pastas, most salads $18+ and meats starting at $35+.  We need true moderately priced restaurants in Westmount, not overpriced mediocre wanna be trendy places.  

I love Lucille's Oyster Dive and Brasserie, this place just doesn't seem to fit with the others.  I hope they can right this ship or it will be very short lived."}
{"text":"Where do I start.

First they sat us a group of 8 at a ridiculously small table which was meant for max 6 people, they ended moving us downstairs in front of the kitchen which was more spacious but way too hot......

Took forever to get out drinks as we were unsure you out server was.
We finally got to order...I ordered the \"famous\" Meatball and Osso Bucco to start and the Veal Chop as my main. The server came back to inform me that there was NO Meatballs left and if I wanted to order something else so i ordered the carne crudo. The server came back again to inform me they were also out of that....so I ended up ordering a Caesar Salad.
A couple of minutes later she came back to the table to let us know that there was only one Veal Chop left so I had to order something else again......I enede up going with her suggestion of the Veal Milanese.

The Caesar salad was good
Osso Bucco was not tender enough and also tasteless
Veal Milanese was good but I would have much prefered the Veal Chop.

Took forever to get our bills as the server had to constantly go back to make changes.
Overall I very bad experience would not return."}
{"text":"Ah I made the right choice a few weeks back when I wrote this review, and it sat in my drafts box. Oops!!

Across the street from my hotel is this cute, new little place. Enter to great music and a warm welcome, an impressive forno oven at the centre and the smell of rising bread. The place could perhaps use a bit more of a cohesive design, but it's a great start, and besides... I'm here for the food!!

The menu is fairly small, but I feel covers the wants of a diner seeking authentic, quality Italian!

I asked my waiter, Roger, for his suggestions. He selected a meal I wasn't sure I wanted (spaghetti carbonara), which I decided to go with. Am I ever glad I did! A bit of bite in this meal. A reasonable helping of perfectly-cooked spaghetti in a creamy sauce, a generous portion of large-cut bacon and a hint of white truffle oil. Oh, delightful for a snowy day. I paired a Pinot Grigio with the dish.

I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a terrific place to have a real wood-fired pizza or an Italian dinner. All of the staff are extremely polite and nice to talk to. They also have a full bar with a great selection of spirits and cocktails. The location is very convenient and easy to find near many other bars and restaurants."}
{"text":"I was visiting co workers across the street when I first went here.  Pretty much every app was fresh and delicious (caprese, arancini, bruchetta).  Pasta dishes were amazing (tastes like fresh pasta to me).  Super friendly owner and staff.  Went back for takeout for lunch and it was another hit.  Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Parm has a great atmosphere and excellent service as would be expected from the Lucille's group. It's very pricey even for Westmount. But you leave pretty satisfied with the portions. My only complaints would be with the pasta that comes with Chicken Parmesean, the sauce was full of minced olives which is an odd choice. As well, the ceasar salad dressing had way too much vinegar. I've had the veal milanese as well and it was outstanding.

Overall a great restaurant."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricier side but the quality of the food is up there. Delicious. Had the salmon as appetizer, melt in your mouth. The veal parm was excellent, as was the octopus which was to die for. All that plus 6 oysters and 2 glasses of wine was $190 before tip."}
{"text":"I was seeing a lot of mixed reviews about this place but being that Parm is owned by the same people who run Lucille's I definitely wanted to check it out. I went to on a Saturday date night with my boyfriend and we both had a great experience! Even though the food is a bit on the pricey side , the quality and portion size made up for it. The inside is way bigger than it looks ,they have multiple floors and nice casual chic decor inside perfect for a date night. The music was good and lovely but not so loud that we couldn't carry on a conversation which was great ! They had a nice selection of wine we had one called 19crimes that they said was one of their more popular and it was very good ! We had the oysters to start and just like at Lucille's the oysters were big and fresh . I ordered the lamb orecchiette and it was to die for , the portion size was more than generous , the pasta was cooked perfectly and they definitely did not skimp on the lamb which was also perfectly cooked and seasoned. my boyfriend had the veal Milanese and he said he really enjoyed it as well ! I'm definitely looking forward to going back and trying more of their dishes :)"}
{"text":"So nothing extraordinary about the food, but really very good.  I suppose what i love about this place is the personalities in the restaurant.  I love people willing to banter back and forth.  Staff that doesn't take themselves too seriously. It makes life and your experience so much more delightful.   

Had the spaghetti and meatball and it was comforting.  Add a couple glasses of wine and I'm in my happy place.  

1) cleanliness: very much above average 
2) service:  simply the best 
3) ambiance:  warm and inviting
4) food: comforting 

I would very much recommend this place.  Enjoy!!!"}
