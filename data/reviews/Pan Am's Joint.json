{"text":"Very misleading! I ordered the Delish jerk chicken wrap and ended up with a Naan wrap with Indian rice, not good at all plus it took 1 hour and 17 minutes to get here. I will not be ordering from here again!!!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the quality and the price of the food. Everything on the menu is made fresh and nothing is frozen. The portions are good as well. I had the poutine and I could tell the fries were cut fresh and like many items on the menu, the price was very worth it. I recommend everyone to come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"By far the best place for burgers, deserts and poutine!  This is my second time buying food here and it's beyond amazing. You can tell the chef is passionate about what he does because the food is always fresh and tasty! I can't wait to try everything on the menu! The burgers/sandwiches at pan ams joint surpass mcdonalds,burger King,  wendys , harveys etc. The quality is superb. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. You're seriously missing out if you haven't tried Pan Am's Joint.  Best of luck to the owner! He's doing an awesome job!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and noticed this nice little place. It recently just opened up. Located just across the street from UoT and the pan and sports centre in the same plaza as the Fossil and Haggis pub.   They serve many different flavours of Kawartha ice-cream. All their food is fresh and made in the store. The chicken Caesar wrap, pulled pork and fish and chips are better than those I've had at well known restaurants. The owner is super nice too.   Definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I drove around and cannot find this place.  I think the only other review is phony, put here by someone who is going to put anew sign on an existing restaurant  and this cash in on the PanAm games which will be across the road from this address. They just haven't got the money to put up a sign on one of the place already there."}
{"text":"This restaurant is probably alright if you dine in.   I ordered delivery on JustEat, 2 orders of fish and chips and a specialty salad with crispy home-style chicken strips.   The fish and chips were okay, since i ordered delivery, the fish and fried being soggy is quite inevitable, so I'm not gonna complain.   The salad.  I asked them to toss the salad dressing, but they didn't, no biggie, the crispy chicken strips were decent, nothing special, what really disappointed me was the salad itself, the vegetables were not fresh, which made it unappetizing.   I guess they do better in other food, like burgers and poutine, I might try this restaurant again, but they did left a bad impression with the salad."}
{"text":"Walked in and immediately noted the broken tile on the floor and general state of the storefront. Did not want to try much of their food at that point. Sweet potato fries were not salted.  Given the name and quality of the storefront, this place seems to be here only to cash in on the Pan American games. I suspect it will be gone shortly thereafter."}
