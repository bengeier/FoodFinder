{"text":"Went twice...3 courses each time. below average at best. Flavourless....served barely warm (and I was with a Cuban)...no atmosphere. Bill was $75 and then $89. For 2 people...worth about 40..MAX!! Go to Julie's or Agate or Taco Bell for that matter. ps people...you can deep fry a shoe and it tastes good. Save your money."}
{"text":"Easily the best mojitos in town.   My husband and I have been going there since it opened and we are never disappointed.  We only order from the tapas menu and our favourites are the seafood choices and yucca fries."}
{"text":"Dined on Friday, Feb 6.  It was a busy evening, many parties in there.  The place is small but vibrant. Tried the $25 winterlicious menu (the regular $30 Blue Plate menu).  The Tropical Salad is fresh.  Confit de Canard is succulent, but the skin could be more crispy.  Will come back."}
{"text":"Great Cuban Tapas place just round the corner from Broadway TTC Station. Efficient & pleasant staff.  Good food & prices reasonable. Small patio in Summer at the back."}
{"text":"This is now my \"go to\" place.  Andres the owner is fantastic.  He's always checking to see if everyone is having a good time.  The vibe is relaxed, the food is tasty and the prices are great.  Mojitos are a must."}
{"text":"Okay, bland food. Great service gave it a third star. Fun ambiance."}
{"text":"This was a friendly place. We went here for winterlicious.  The service is great and music was nice. The good was good but just doesn't have a Cuban vibe. I felt it was ordinary food.  I was hoping this place had more of a Cuban experience. That said that's the only reason why I gave it a 3.  I was hoping to get a Cuban feel but I did not."}
{"text":"Just went here last night with my husband for Summerlicious and we thought it was great.   The back patio is really cute and they were playing Cuban music the whole time which we really enjoyed. It was clean and the server was very polite. Almost felt like we were on vacation (except for hearing the buses at Broadview St which are right next to the patio).  We ordered the salads as appetizers and they were both massive which was a nice surprise considering it was a Summerlicious menu. The dressing was delicious.   I got the bass fillet with coconut rice and my husband had a steak with yucca fries. I have no idea what yucca fries are but they were amazing. The rice was a little bland even with the coconut but it didn't bother me too much. The bass was really good and cooked well.   I had a few bites of the steak and it was average but still very tasty.   The best part was the dessert! I got the chocolate cake and the husband got the creme brule. The cake was so die for and just the right amount.  Overall we really enjoyed Mambo Lounge. The atmosphere was very comfortable and the food was great. I'd like to go back when there are bands playing I think it would be a fun time!"}
{"text":"Mambo Lounge is a fav go to spot.  No doubt the best mojos in the city and the Tapas is affordable, fresh and always yummy.  Best part of this place is the cool vibe and the staff.  Owner Andres is the best...we are treated like family by him and all of the serving staff.  You go once and you'll be hooked - this place just doesn't disappoint - especially on a Friday or Saturday night when you will fight for a table."}
{"text":"A family member was in town and requested Cuban food for dinner, I'm not that familiar with Cuban food, so I promptly did a search and came upon Mambo Lounge.  I am glad to have discovered a great place to have some authentic Mojitos and delicious Tapas!  We went early on a Tuesday night so it was quiet but were told by our server that Thursday, Friday and Saturday the restaurant is quite busy as there is live music including a Cuban Jazz band.  Our server was very gracious, explained all the dishes we asked about, made our amazing Mojitos, and made sure we had all the sides, sauces etc. we could possibly need or want.  We tried most of the Tapas dishes, there was a deal, 4 Tapas for $24.  (Mains were $18- $30) The Yucca fries, \"Quesedilla\", and braised flank steak were standouts.  The Crab cake was also yummy.  The homemade goat cheese with garlic was delish as well.  If you like things spicy, ask for their homemade hot sauce!  I would absolutely go back for more!"}
{"text":"We went to mambo lounge on summerlicious, we ordered mojitos, the tropical salad, chef salad, confit du canard, bistec con yuca, flan de coco y creme brûlée. Everything was really good, but the portions were kind of small and the service was a little slow, also the bistec was a bit chewy."}
{"text":"Nice little Cuban restaurant, serving great, tasty food. Must have apps include the Fired Cassava Sticks and the Grilled Calamari. I had the stewed Lamb Shank and it was so tender and full of flavour. The sides, mash potatoes and vegetables were great as well. Fresh veg, not frozen or overlooked served piping hot and well seasoned. If you've not ever had tasty Cuban food, this place should be on your bucket list."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for Winterlicious. Our reservation was for 7:30 but we arrived early. The waitress was nice and sat us even though we were 30 minutes early. Very kind of her as there's not much waiting room between arriving and the tables.  The service was good. Our waitress was extremely friendly and even joked around with the group. However, I can see where other yelpers commented on the slow service- there was some wait times for our next courses.   Food wise? I ordered the black bean soup which was so so. It looked delicious but tasted a little on the bland side. My entree was the Steak with the yucca fries. The fries are the best part! Other then that, I wasn't such a fan of the steak. It wasn't cooked to my temp and it just seemed very bland. That was the common theme across the food board.   Verdict? It was just alright. Would I go again? Probably not- perhaps Cuban inspired food is not for me."}
{"text":"First time there yesterday on a Saturday so they were half filled but the service was still attentive.  I had the lamb shank with mashed potatoes & veggies (bok choy, carrots & onions) while my friends had the fix prix menu: sea bass fillet with coconut rice, shredded beef with tomato sauce, and grilled chicken with rice & beans with chocolate cake & flan de coco.   My lamb shank was fall of the bone soft & full of flavor.  My friend's shredded beef with tomato sauce was the most savory while the grilled chicken was very bland (what would you expect from grilled chicken anyway!).  We had a lot of fun except there was suppose to be dancers with live music that night but they're wasn't, oh well."}
{"text":"Made reservations for two for Summerlicious. My friend arrived before I did and she waited almost 15 minutes for someone to see to her. It wasn't that busy. We sat at the back patio at first but it was full of cigar smokers so we went inside. We waited another 15 minutes for someone to come and take my drink order, and then we noticed the waitress was busying herself with some cutlery at the back of the restaurant.  She seemed to be the one assigned to our table, but showed no indication she would be coming to serve us anytime soon, so we left and went to down the street to Factory Girl and had the best freaking meal I've had in a long time. I recommend Factory Girl instead if this place.  If I could choose 0 stars I would because they did absolutely nothing for us, but Yelp wants me to put something so it only gets 1 star."}
{"text":"Summerlicios dinner 2012.  Long wait for salads.  Warm salad that felt like it was left outside for too long.   Each dish took forever to come ... over salted fish.  Deserts was so so... tasted like pre bought costco cakes.    Two people from our group got stomach aches from eating here.     Never coming back"}
{"text":"Just went for the first time last night and really liked it!  The staff was nice from the get-go, and did a great job with food recommendations. There were 5 of us, and they did suggest 4 plates for person, but we ordered 16 plates altogether and that was almost too much.  They have a nice and spacious back patio, well enclosed so you are not disturbed by traffic, etc from nearby Broadview. It was quite relaxing back there.  The mojitos were really good and the food was delicious. It's a Cuban tapas joint, and my only complaint is I would have liked more spice on some of the food. The stuffed red pepper with rice and beans was bland and could have been better. Definitely get the yucca fries, the shrimp and the plantains. Trust me, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Been here many a time. If you've been to Havana the Cuban food here is on a at or better. The service is great as well. Highly recommend the ropa viaja. Amazing meat plate"}
{"text":"Ate here for a Summerlicious dinner, where the only thing on the menu was anything that's part of their Summerlicious offer. The food and mixed drinks was nonetheless enjoyable, the kind of thing I'd imagine shoving down if I was loafing around a tropical beach--it is supposed to be all Cuban style, eh?   I really loved the Ensalada de Chef--a baby spinach salad with blue cheese. Truth be told: blue cheese makes everything better.  There's a large rear patio, with enough shade to make you feel more relaxed even in a disgusting heat wave. If you like dining outside with the air serenaded with Latin salsa dance music and punctuated with the competing sound of idling bus engines, then therefore this patio I speak of, my friend, is a hidden paradise on the Danforth.  {TTC: right 'round the corner from Broadview subway station.}"}
{"text":"Friendly service.  The dishes were delicious.  I loved my chicken.  My girlfriend's steak was juicy..."}
{"text":"Our party came here for Winterlicious.. Our reservation was at 8:30 pm and we ended dinner at around 12 am - not because of us taking our time but because of how slow the service was at the restaurant. The interval of us flagging someone down took 15 mins, and another 30 mins for whatever we ordered to arrive at our table (even our bill!!).  3 course meal from Winterlicious:  TROPICAL SALAD Normal salad - nothing special about it. I was happy there were a few pieces of avocado though.  MERO ANTARTICO (Sea bass fillet with coconut rice) This was the most bland looking and bland tasting sea bass I've had. The coconut rice wasn't fully cooked - parts of it were still raw.. best part was probably the carrots... LOL  MOUSSE DE CHOCOLATE (Chocolate cake) How'd it take them 30 minutes to bring this out? It's just a piece of chocolate cake that was sliced up. Nothing special.  Will not visit here again.."}
{"text":"Went here a few years ago and had tapas on the back patio and loved it.  I was excited to go back but as it was during summerlicious they were only offering a set menu.  The back patio is lovely, but the food was just okay.  Yes, the Yucca fries are yummy, but the steak was mediocre (kinda fatty).  Also, the service was very slow - and it really wasn't busy.  Might give this place another shot to try the main menu again, but was disappointed on my last visit."}
{"text":"Great Cuban food but the music is too loud for the small space. The musicians are in the middle of the place and the amplifier is set to way too high of a volume for the room and one needs to yell to be heard at all.  Things got better when the musicians got a break.  The service is not the fastest, but it is friendly in a non-supplicating way.  The 'Tapas' appetizers are 4 for $21 or 1 for $6.  They are too small for $6 a piece, so the $21 deal is better value.    This time I had the Biftec, their steak, which is the most expensive item on the menu. It was done very well, with yuca fries and vegetable, but tad overpriced for what you get.    It is a good place to bring a date and share Tapas."}
{"text":"We headed to Mambo in search of a more upscale dinner to remind us of a great trip to Havana we went on a few years ago. We were drawn in by the promise of Cuban music and \"the best mojito in Toronto\".   Pros: The music was nice and added to the atmosphere..and did a great job at drowning out the rowdy table next to us (more on that below). The black bean soup was so-so, but needed seasoning big-time. The yucca fries were tasty, crispy and came with a great dipping sauce. My husband really enjoyed his duck confit, but it wasn't really a Cuban dish...  Cons: We walked in and were greeted by a less than friendly server who preferred communicating with her hands (i.e. sign for two and pointing) rather than welcoming us and showing us a table. As mentioned, we were next to a table of about 10-12 very loud and obnoxious people (like, banging on the table and yelling), which was very unpleasant. And their server seemed to instigate it and encourage it...As for food, I had the pork, and the sauce tasted very store-bought (too sweet, not much depth), and the rice and beans were overcooked so some of the grains of rice were very hard. The mojitos were very strong...I know that's not a problem for some people, but we were driving, so drinking what tasted like a glass of rum with a few sprigs of mint was problematic for us, and we didn't finish either drinks.   Overall, this place tries to make it look like it's more of a big deal than it is...which is disappointing. Cuban food is so delicious and flavourful and it deserves more attention and pride than it gets at Mambo."}
{"text":"I've only been once and I quite liked it.  The two of us shared 8 tapas plates and were full but not stuffed.  Next time we go we will order 4 tapas plates and share a main course, in order to only get our favorites.  Great: Crab cake Rojas something  Good: Fried yucca Shrimp Calamari Cigar Quesadilla  Decent: Chicken drumsticks  Bland or bad: nothing that we tried!"}
{"text":"Tapas in the Cuban style. Nothing to write home about nor long winded review about. Adios."}
{"text":"I'm from  Southern California new to Canada, trying to find Hispanic food has been hard for me. Not having Mexican food readily available  is very sad. I came across this place and was excited to get some Cuban food. Figured that with the relationship Canada has with Cuba, it would be Better than what I'd get in LA, I was soooo wrong.   I had the shredded flank steak. Rice was not cooked Rice and beans were cold Beef was poor quality with what tasted like a jar of BBQ sauce dumped on top.   Do not waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Was here with friends for my 30th, food was good and service was great, we pretty much had the whole place to our selves as it is pretty small."}
{"text":"Great mariachi band, awesome service, and good food! Try the tapas"}
