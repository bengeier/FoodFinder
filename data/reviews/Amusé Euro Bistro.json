{"text":"We went on a Friday night and admittedly they were very busy. We tried to call for 2 hours before we arrived to make reservations and the phone was busy for the entire 2 hours. We walked in to put our name down for a table. I informed the hostess that we tried to call. She didn't acknowledge my statement so I asked her if she heard me. She said yes and didn't know why the phone would be off the hook on a Friday night.  I informed her apparently it was.  She was not pleasant. We were sat in about 20 minutes as she said. The bartenders were friendly while we waited. After being seated we placed our orders. The waitress brought appetizers and never checked on us again until our food was served. An hour wait for our food and it was barely warm. The waitress was not attentive at all and seemed to be aggravated with even being there.  On a side note if you go to restroom bring a heater because there is virtually no heat in them.  Poor service and mediocre food. Not worth going back."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this for our anniversary dinner and were unpleasantly surprised by how much the food lacked taste. We had heard mixed reviews and wanted to give it a try for ourselves. We ordered the pork chop and chicken parmesan. Both meals come with fingerling potatoes that seemed to just be boiled and dumped on the plate. No seasoning or taste whatsoever. Very underwhelming meal and certainly not worth the price. The pork and chicken were both very bland, as well as, the veggies served with the meals. It is shame because the atmosphere and location are awesome. Huge menu, too but strongly lacking in quality of food. Hopefully with a few adjustments, Amuse can improve their food and dining experience."}
{"text":"Awesome food & service! The food was definitely on point.  Those fritas were awesome.  My pork dish (osso?) was great! Our service was amazing, really went above & beyond."}
{"text":"I just ate my leftovers and remembered again how truly good the food was.  We started with the goat cheese bruchetta. Not only was the plating beautiful, everything on the plate, down to the herb sprinkle, added to the flavor.  Onto salads: my husband had the beet and I had the brussel sprout. Again, each ingredient was carefully chosen, down to the bacon slice, fried in a swirl that crumbled perfectly with just a touch of my fork.  Then the Mornay Pomme Frites.  He had 2 chicken Street Tacos, which he enjoyed and I had the Pork Ragu small plate--which was not small at all. (my leftovers today)  We finished with a hazelnut torte which was very good.  the service was attentive, but it was not busy for a Saturday night. I hope more people visit this place so it can be here a long time.  We have eaten at several Medina restaurants and have enjoyed Thyme, which is the full package--atmosphere, drinks etc--but this is a great casual bistro and we really hope it will suceed!"}
{"text":"Terrible service on a Sunday afternoon. Wrecking the birthday lunch for my wife. Bad food and no one around to tell or fix.  Sat with empty drink glasses for the longest time.  2 people ordered the same Meatball sandwich and it was terrible.  They did take 1 off the bill. They will not get our business again."}
{"text":"First time here. Loved it! I liked the cozy atmosphere the minute we walked in. Rustic but modern. Nice music, Sinatra, Buble, Harry Connick Jr, Dean Martin. Started out worth the Margarita pizza as an app. Crispy crust was awesome. The glasses of wine were nice size pours. Not like some places we've been. I liked the fact you can order different sizes on some things. I ordered the smallest on the pasta, and still had plenty to take home! It was delicious. Sauce was like homemade. Pasta was cooked perfectly. The salad I ordered on the side was only $2 extra. Where do you ever get a mixed green side salad for $2? And it was good sized! All dressings except ranch are made there. We ordered the cake ball trio for dessert. Very tasty and just enough for us to share. Can't wait to take our friends! Give it a try, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. It's such a great deal. A nice change from every place we've been."}
{"text":"My friend and I went in. We sat there for 30 minutes. There was no one in the place. Literally maybe two couples at the bar and two tables in the restaurant. The bar tender ignored us while she talked to the people on the other side. I begged for a menu. She gave it to us. The food looked delicious on the menu! We were salivating. We sat there and sat there. We both took turns going to the bathroom while the other waited to place a drink order. I asked the bartender if we could order beers. She said she would be right there and never came back. After 30 minutes, we left and went to PJ Marley's. So sad. Poor service wrecks the experience and makes you reluctant to go back and try the food. For an upscale gastro pub, the bartender really lacked class and finesse."}
{"text":"First visit So happy to have chosen this restaurant Sea scallops with risotto excellent and a very generous portion Brie melt with grilled chicken so savory Huge sandwich couldn't even eat half of it! Had appetizer of stuffed peppers. Good but IMO, I make better. LOL  Cocktails were plenty to choose from Will def return here"}
{"text":"I stopped in a few weeks ago to place a to go order. While I waited, the owners' husband?, proceeded to belittle and insult his staff freely and openly for anyone and everyone to see. It was beyond uncomfortable. I felt sorry for one of the servers in particular. It's a shame really because the food was good and the portion size was more than adequate. I wanted to try other things on the menu but what I witnessed keeps me from ever stepping foot in there again. Learn to treat your people with respect."}
{"text":"Super cool atmosphere! Great food!  Butternut Soup for starters. It was delicious! Salmon w parmesan risotto for dinner. Outstanding! Bartender hand my margarita from scratch w Agave nectar and rimmed the glass w smoked sea salt! Service at bar was great and staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Nice place on the square, friendly staff and a bonus was half off bottles of wine . We had the calamari to start, very crispy and flavorful. It was just a little heavy on maybe a garlic flavor. The main course was very good, I had the lamb chops and they came out at a perfect med-rare. My wife had chicken Marsala and it was fantastic over risotto. The 4 star over 5 was just a slight issue with server, she didn't tell us the specials, she didn't tell us bottled wine was half off and we didn't get bread like everyone else. It wasn't a deal breaker and she may have been new. She was very nice just maybe a little forgetful."}
{"text":"Have not been here in almost a year. Frequented during its first year and found it very enjoyable. Tonight not so much. Menu has changed prices increased, quality greatly decreased. My breaded veal was so greasy i couldn't eat it. Crossing off my list for sure.c"}
{"text":"What a great experience! I was hoping the French onion soup would be as good as their other restaurant Rose Hill, and it was. Just amazing. I would go back just for that soup! There were so many things we wanted to try. I had the eggplant and my husband had the burger. Both were great. I thought $14 for a burger was a little pricey, but it was really big, enough to share if you wanted to get an appetizer. It came with choice of fries. The sweet potato fries were great and very plentiful. Our server was very friendly. She was very knowledgeable on the food and wine.  Glad to have a go to place on the square!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've been over ten times, many with out of town guests, and have had a fantastic experience every single time. I've never had a wait, so please check this place out."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not good either.  The food was mediocre overall, and for the price I expect more.    Service was average, but again, not bad.  The bar was slow for mixed drinks."}
{"text":"This place is only about 3 months old and new to Medina square. This is definitely the new spot!! Me and my girlfriend split the Brussel sprouts salad, the eggplant stack, prima Vera pasta, and bolognese pasta. I know. We can put it down. The salad had a champagne vinaigrette and was amazing, so light and refreshing. The eggplant stack tasted just like a chicken Parmesan (a very good one) and the broccolini that came with it was good. The prima Vera pasta had roasted red peppers, zucchini and other veggies in it and had oil for the \"sauce\". I think it was the same oil that came with the warm bread that came right as we arrived. The oil was outstanding. It had rosemary, thyme and several other herbs in it. The bolognese was my favorite, the sauce was outstanding along with the chicken livers. All of our food was so good and we got the smallest sizes of each pasta which you can see is a very generous helping even split between two people. Their pastas have 3 options for size, course, entree and shareable, which I really liked. Plus everything was very reasonably priced, our prima Vera pasta was only $6 and for all of this, our bill was $38. Overall, I give five stars to this new business, go get it!!!"}
{"text":"A great first impression, appealing atmosphere, attentive service, good food and generous portions, we will be returning, a new go to restaurant for us."}
{"text":"Good relaxing  atmosphere, you can hear each other talk. The food is good. I don't like their ranch dressing, their house dressing and Champagne vinegar, I liked.  Are waiter Cole was first rate. He is articulate and courteous and most of all knows the menu and a lot about the restaurant. He even knew how to pair the wine with the Duck au l'Orange.  Not bad for Medina Ohio. I would come back."}
{"text":"We went to the bistro last night with high hopes. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. The restaurant wasn't at all crowded at 6:30 pm, but because there were two large parties there, the service definitely suffered. We ordered the beet salad, which had us thinking we were going to have a great meal, but that was not to be. We waited, at least, a half hour for our main course to appear, after our salads, and ended up eating too much bread because of it. The main course, my husband had trout and I had the promodoro pasta, was overly salty.  We can't blame our server as she was running around waiting on the party and other tables. Obviously more help is needed in the dining room as well as the kitchen. We probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"My coworker and I both work on the square, and we decided to go here over the summer after our shift on a whim. We were hungry, and it was open. The food was very good, and the cheesecake was to die for. It was worth every dollar."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The atmosphere when you walk in is very warm and welcoming. I had the catch of the day which was the pan seared snapper, it was perfectly done! My husband had the wienersnetzle. He has been to Germany many of times and he was pleasantly surprised! The server was great! Some of these reveiws talk poorly about the service but people need to realize that everyone has their off days. We brought in our soon to be one year old daughter and the servers crowded around her which she absolutely loved and so did we! The place is great and we will be back soon! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!!!! My boyfriend and I split the Brussels sprout salad, course size pasta primavera, and bolognese and the eggplant stack. Everything was amazing!!! The portions were huge especially for the price we had enough food to bring home for at least one meal, probably 2. The complimentary bread and oil already had me sold and the actual meals were outstanding. Very friendly service, as well. We will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good food. Totally overpriced for the quantity. 1 entree, 2 appetizers, 4 beers = $75. A tad too high in my opinion."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night and this place wasn't too busy. There were however two large parties there while we were there.   I think the service was pretty bad for this reason. It was very clear that we were not a priority and that the large parties were more important. I got the beet salad which was very good, but that seemed to be the only thing I really enjoyed the whole evening. I also got one of the pastas which was not very impressive. It was basically just macaroni and peas in a cream sauce and was rather boring. My dad got the trout and rice and it was so unbelievably salty that he struggled to even eat it. The rice was very bland. This place has potential but definitely needs better, more creative chefs and more servers. It is also incredibly overpriced."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for an impromptu afternoon dinner and were very impressed with everything the place had to offer. A nice European rustic country feel with incredible food at good prices and large portions. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch doubt I would ever return food was ok. Our server did not know anything about the menu or the drinks they carried. It took a little over 30 minutes for our breakfast to come out (mind you there was only about 10 people there). On the plus side very cute and clean inside."}
{"text":"Honestly, Medina Square is pretty slow on sundays. Not a lot of cars parked, not a lot of people walking. This is a gross misrepresentation of the restaurants there though. The whole square should be filled for brunch at Amusé Euro Bistro.   I had a Serbian poached egg and a few bloody Mary's (Ask for it loaded!). I have never felt like a breakfast person and I have never felt like a bread at breakfast person, I have been converted.  The poached eggs were perfectly cooked and the holland side sauce wasn't overpowering. It paired perfectly with tha Serbian sausage and French baguette it was served on. Not to mention how friendly the waitress and bartender are.   Overall, five outta five. Makes me feel like r"}
{"text":"We went to Amuse for dinner recently and I was a little concerned about what expect because of some of the yelp reviews. Plus, there was a \"Now hiring\" sign in the front window. Anyway, we went in and five of us were seated almost immediately. This place is larger than it looks. We were seated in the rear of the restaurant and our drink orders were taken quickly by our fast and friendly waitress.  We ordered an appetizer of charcuterie, which was fresh and delicious. I also ordered an unfiltered German white beer, which was excellent.   For dinner, I ordered the eggplant parmesan, which was very tasty. I really liked the sauce. There were thick slices of eggplant in it and the presentation was terrific. I remembered while eating it that I'm not a huge fan of egg plant. But it's been so long since I've had it that I needed a reminder. Still, I finished the leftovers for breakfast.  All of our meals were very good and we'd definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Good food and wonderful service.  Kind and hospitable.  We enjoyed the mothers day brunch buffet"}
{"text":"We've tried Amuse for a few dinners and also their brunch. I can see the appeal with Amuse for a drink and maybe some light appetizers to share. We did this once and tried a couple of their drinks that were a nice touch to the summer heat.  For me though, I like my balsamic in moderation or on the light side. We've tried flat breads to main entrees and seem to keep coming across a heavy hand with the balsamic where it drowns out the rest of the food for me.   With brunch, my husband ordered a sandwich and there was not much flavor with the bread being stale and more balsamic. I would say there is a missed opportunity here for fresh bread or even partnering with a local bakery for fresh bread.   I think there is a great potential with the drinks and the atmosphere of the square. Worth a try if in Medina as it might be more to your liking. We'll be back in another 6 months or so to see how the restaurant is evolving."}
{"text":"Delicious food and HUGE portions. Great service, wish I could recall our server's name because she was a delight."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I have eaten here 3 times and have yet to be impressed by anything. The service is okay. The first time my husband and I went for a date night the sever was great and welcoming. We ordered the poutine but there was no cheese on it. Just average fries soaked in brown salty gravy. The Brussel sprout salad was something I could make better at home. I visited a few months later to eat lunch by myself and catch up on some work and the server was rather snotty towards me and did not seem happy to be there or to have to serve me at all. The pizza that time was pretty soggy on the bottom and the Caesar salad had anchovies on it, which I am open to but there was an entire canned anchovy sitting on the top overpowering the entire meal. Our third visit we walked up for the ice festival with our 1 year old son (who is very well behaved and we take everywhere) and although we would normally dress better, we were layered for warmth just like everybody else at that time and there was no wait for dinner so we asked for a table with a high chair. You would think we were the first people to ever bring a baby here. True to his easy going nature he didn't make a peep, quietly ate his bread and baby food that we brought and played with a toy. There were only a few tables and one table insisted on glaring at us the entire time and the staff was just as snotty as previously mentioned. The poutine this time was COVERED in cheese. I love cheese but this was an offensive amount of just plain mozzarella. I'm talking a one inch layer over an entire boat of fries. We hardly touched them. We couldn't even find the fries underneath the cheese. I guess it's all or nothing there when it comes to poutine. It was an inhumane amount of cheese. The bramble on pizza was delicious though and this time nobody insisted on correcting by pronunciation of the wine (that of which was totally subjective). We live close by and are always excited when a new business opens on the square but I just don't see this place lasting. They try very hard to be a fine dining establishment but it just isn't working. The food quality and the service does not match the price or image they try to portray."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place was amazing.  My husband and I went here for our anniversary and the food was amazing.  We had the tapenade as an appetizer which was so good.  It had sun-dried tomato and was a perfect starter.  I had the chicken Marsala and my husband had the eggplant stack.  The eggplant was really tasty but wasn't a lot of food.  Mine however came with risotto and was so delicious. The people at the table near us ordered a salad and it was massive.  We had a few drinks and expected the bill to be close to $100 and surprisingly.... it was only $68 for an appetizer, cup of soup, two dinners, and four specialty drinks.  We will definitely be back!"}
