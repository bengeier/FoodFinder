{"text":"We came tonight and was immediately greeted warmly by the manager that took us to our table. Good was amazing and we look forward to every visit"}
{"text":"The food was awful, terrible service, horrible management. Nastiest place I've ever ate. The food was dry, soup tasted like it was stirred with a foot. Do NOT recommend this place to anyone..doesn't even deserve one star!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood sushi spot. It's a good value for the price. I visit weekly and get the BOGO sushi rolls. This special is available after 8pm on Mon - Thur and after 9pm on Fri & Sat.  Unfortunately, they are closed on Sunday. My favorite rolls include: California, shrimp tempura, and BBQ eel avocado. The rolls are small; but they are prepared well. This isn't a fancy place, but it's a great deal if you're in the area during the promotion.   I usually order take-out. But when I dine in for dinner, I enjoy the complimentary chips and sauce that they provide before the meal. I also enjoy the bento box. I usually get red curry chicken with steamed rice, a spring roll and a BBQ eel avocado roll.  This has become my go-to sushi spot when I want something quick and cheap, but also fresh and tasty.  It's not a place that I would take out-of-towners; but it's great for a local girl like me :-)"}
{"text":"This clean little Asian restaurant has a solid menu, good food, decent sushi and just added a full bar!  Love this local spot!"}
{"text":"We stopped here last night on our way home after trying some rolls at Tanaka. We are a fan of this place because of the atmosphere and friendly people. A neat and clean place with yummy sushi. They have sushi specials now that are offered in the late evening."}
{"text":"Had dinner here 1 time and the fried rice tasted like the rice was used from the precious night and tasted and smelled like Mildo. It was nasty. But sushi was good!!"}
{"text":"Went for BOGO sushi, never got any. Been here for an hour. Asked our waitress to take it off the bill. A couple that was seated after us got their sushi. Waitress never refilled my water, and we have been sitting here for fifteen minutes ready to pay the check to get outta here. Used to love this place, but not anymore sadly. If you want to go here, do not go during BOGO sushi hours."}
{"text":"Nice little spot. Really good for a date night. The food is really good and reasonably priced. The house Merlot is really good. Staff is friendly. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food.  Pros: -family and child friendly staff and menu -a lot of seating on both sides of bar -great menu selection -very affordable family night out  -indoor and outdoor seating   Cons -parking can be hard to find when Buffalo Wild Wings is busy -"}
{"text":"Food was very delicious. The lady serving us was so nice. My son was sweating; it was a hot day, and she treated him like my mom would, or one of my aunts. She kept fanning him so he would get cool...I have to smile, becuse it so reminds me of what family would do.  The only reason why I did not give this place a full 5 stars is because in my opinion it was pricey...but we did come during dinner hours. I think I read another Yelper write that lunch prices are much better. If this place was closer to home, I would be there weekly."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the Charlotte area (Concord) for Christmas with her family. After an enjoyable day spent with family, it was time for the traditional Christmas dinner - Chinese food, of course!   We started driving around the area, saw a few take out places, then drove into a shopping center where we discovered The Asian Cafe.  What a discovery!  Awesome food, very professional and friendly service (thank you Dave!) and overall, a wonderful experience.  I had the Mongolian Triple with beef, chicken and shrimp with lots of spices, noodles, onions and scallions. Spicy hot, delicious and wonderful.  My wife wasn't too hungry and just got a plate of chicken fried rice, which came in gargantuan portions and also was moist and delicious.  This is a great place to eat if your looking for Asian food in the Concord area."}
{"text":"Love love this place. Good atmosphere and kid friendly. My family loves the bento box the best!!"}
{"text":"We ate here this evening and ordered the bento boxes, Thai mango curry, bourbon chicken, and sweet and sour chicken.  All of which was very tasty.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First and the last time. Got my order wrong and got an attitude with me. Ordered unsweet kept giving me sweet.   Glad to leave the place. Just wasn't right. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"My daughter and I eat her at least once a week and it's our favorite! We always take advantage of the 1/2 price sushi and we get alot of the money!  I would rather get my food to go because the service while dining in is not good. The last time we dined in the waitress acted like she was rushing us to leave. She kept coming to the table, trying to take our plates when we were not even finished eating. That was the 2nd time that happened to us. I highly recommend this place for a great price on sushi!"}
{"text":"Here is another restaurant in concord with subpar food. I really wish concord would open up a delicious restaurant with quality food. The staff is not friendly and the cleanliness of the place is non existent. The hostess was walking around looking clueless. The crab Rangoon did not have crab in it lol. The stir fry was okay but the fried rice was nothing impressive. A lot of the food was cold too! Never again!   Sn: they have a guy in the front that greets the guest while popping gum! How inviting (eye roll)!"}
{"text":"If your open sign is on and the front door unlocked and open don't acted surprised when a customer walks in. Crazy how that works ain't it?"}
{"text":"When we want Asian food this is where we go. Always solid food and taste. The service is top notch and the place is awesome"}
{"text":"Mall food court quality at best. I got the Bento Box option with spicy tuna roll, crab salad, and teriyaki beef. The spicy tuna was a bunch of panko crumbs with thumb sized amount of tuna that didn't have any flavor or spice, and it's obvious the sushi rice wasn't seasoned. My teriyaki beef was just regular hibachi chunks of beef, good and juicy, but not what I ordered. The crab salad was tasty, and I liked it best out of the whole thing. The waitress brought me Siracha sauce to make my spicy tuna actually spicy and teriyaki sauce so I can actually dip my beef into it and get what I actually ordered. We were heading up to VA so this was a rest stop, needless to say, I wouldn't recommend the food to anyone anyways. Service was good though, they should stick to smaller menu and try to make it taste good."}
{"text":"Do NOT go here...unless you enjoy eating at ROACH infested restaurants, that is. I was just there for lunch and while waiting to be seated, witnessed a HUGE cockroach stroll right across the front of the hostess stand! Blech! Needless to say, I'm not there anymore and I don't plan on returning EVER!"}
{"text":"If you are in the Concord area and love Chinese food this is the place to go! Lunch specials for $6 that include a tea and Crab Rangoon with your meal! Come on now! We are talking the best Genersl Tso chicken too. The workers are super nice and really appreciate the business and you can tell because they take care of you. I will drive out of my way to eat here. The have sushi too and it is half off during weekday nights."}
{"text":"Really delicious and freshly made. Went for lunch and ordered a bento box with sesame chicken, BBQ eel roll and crab salad. Terrific choices. The sesame chicken was delicious, moist inside with just enough crunch on the consider and sauce didn't overpower. Love the crab (kani) salad. BBQ eel roll was good also. Kirin beer to wash it down and good service. There's plenty of different dishes and other picks to build your bento boxes but this was my favorite first time pick.   Also very cool to see them cleaning the menus. Hardly ever see that and always hope it happens but I wonder..."}
{"text":"I've eaten at The Asian Cafe several times now.  The great thing about this restaurant is that they offer 1/2 Sushi rolls M-Th Dine in after 8ish.  It's the best Sushi in Concord IMO.  Their Chinese American dishes are very tasty as well.  I recently ordered beef LoMein in anticipation for a greasy Chinese dish and got a delicious no grease Beef LoMein.  I ate all of it and it was a very generous portion.     My boyfriend usually opts for the General Tso's Chicken or Sesame Chicken.  He has yet to complain.  As far as Sushi goes, we usually order the Spicy Tuna, Yellowtail and Tempura Roll.  Regarding my comment about it being the best in Concord, it is good not amazing.  I think what makes it most appealing is that it's 15min. away vs. the 45min. drive to our more preferred Sushi restaurants.    If you're in the area and in the mood for good Chinese/American grub then head on in.  Plus, there's a delicious FroYo place next door for dessert!"}
{"text":"Driving through suburbia, semi-lost somewhere in Concord, a friend suggested we try The Asian Cafe for lunch when both of us were suffering from seriously low blood sugar. It was a good choice. Located in a massive retail complex in an unassuming brick building with a strange, prison bar-looking patio, TAC is a decent little pan-Asian restaurant with a variety of menu options. They've got sushi, hibachi, bento boxes, and basic meat+veggie combo options like Garlic and General Tso's and Kung Pao Chicken.   The service wasn't particularly fast, but it was friendly, and my water glass never dipped below half. The bathrooms are clean. The restaurant is pretty bare bones but not in a bad way. The food was pretty good, and for the price it seems worth a shot if you're in the area and have a jonesin' for some Asian food."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with bogo sushi some nights. The Pad Thai is good. Enough for two people. Wait staff are friendly and provide good service. All around good place to go."}
{"text":"Food is good but sometimes the service lacks and the owners/managers are awful with customer service."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Think $16 dollars for \"bourbon chicken\" that's not really bourbon chicken but maybe more like Mongolian chicken is a bit pricey. Portion size is good."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over a year now and have never been disappointed. Greeted right away, very short wait to be seated and our waitress is always pleasant. I always order some of the same items because its great! I have a shellfish allergy and when I advise them they are always accommodating. My friend came to visited me for an invite I was hosting, she said she wanted some good Chinese type food, I told her I have a place and she was not disappointed, which she is as picky as me. I recommend you stop by if you are in that neck of the woods and even if you aren't. BTW they have BOGO sushi specials during the week."}
{"text":"Really excellent food!  Love to come here for lunch specials.  Also love the sushi, and they have some great late night specials.    Great place!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible! The service was also very good. We showed up around 9 pm, and the server was the only one on the floor and he did such a good job making sure we had everything we needed. The portion size in huge for what we paid for dinner. We will definitely"}
{"text":"Overpriced, sushi not fresh, horrible place to eat! I love sushi like New Zealand cafe, Jade in Ballantyne, and musashi in pineville. Japanese know Sushi,  but the other Asian places around here do not know what quality is!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit, my first for dinner. Overall, our meals were A-OK, hence the 3 stars. My \"spicy\" red curry chicken was anything but spicy, even though I asked that they add some extra spice. And the ratio of carrots to chicken was 50/50, and I don't eat carrots. My Bento Box was $12.95, and everything except the chicken was OK. I Might go back if I'm in the area, but we still prefer Yoshi's in Huntersville, and it is about half the price too."}
{"text":"I went here after reviewing the reviews on Yelp and decided to try it out.   I had sushi WHICH WAS REALLY GOOD( see my photos). I asked one of the employees which was the most popular sushi on the menu. I ordered what he suggested. I'm happy I did!!!  Services was good. They all made direct eye contact. The to-go/ the waiting area had nice comfortable chair sofa with TV's in view.  I CANT WAIT UNTIL I GO BACK THERE!!   Parking was also good"}
{"text":"I work nearby, so this place is a lunchtime favorite. Their menu of daily lunch specials is constantly passed around my workplace and we always look forward to a meal there.  I've ordered sushi, which is always fresh and hand-rolled. They have a two roll and a three roll sushi lunch special that comes with miso soup. My personal favorite meal for lunch is the sesame tofu with fried rice. it comes with a choice of spring roll or crab rangoons for $7 plus tax. The tofu lunch special is a good deal compared to its dinner price of $11.  The staff is very friendly whether you're dining in or carrying-out. A few months ago, I went there with a couple of co-workers on our lunch hour and we we were seated, ate, and paid all within 40 minutes.   My only caveat is the dinner prices are hiked up a bit compared to their lunchtime counterparts.  I highly recommend this place for lunch! Delicious Asian food."}
{"text":"my server was SO sweet today, i have  nothing wrong with the staff or anything like that.. but the food needs to improve. the spicy tuna roll has the texture as if it's been chewed up and spit out and the hibatchi chicken in the bento was literally just bits and pieces and strings of random parts of a chicken. the chicken USED to be in big chunks and was DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Been coming here every since a kid, I think the food declined a bit. Still LOVE the sesame tofu & tofu lettuce wraps, But the pad thai, and drunken noodles were drenched in oil. I give the pad Thai 1 star, it was so oily I could hardly eat it.This happened twice, when I ordered the pad Thai which kind of disappointed me since the staff is so friendly! But I'll continue to come back for the sesame tofu & the lettuce wrap since this place is really convenient for me. (:"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Sushi was great! We were super surprised to find this local gem hidden away in our Target shopping center. Will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"I stopped here on my way home and ordered a hot tea and wonton soup first which were really good. Then I ordered the crunchy Florida roll. I enjoyed all of my food and the service. It is a quaint spot that is bigger than it looks. They have sushi specials as well. I will be visiting this place more often."}
{"text":"First I'll start with the good..... 1/2 price sushi after 8 on weekdays and after 9 on Friday/Saturday.  The Bento Box is also a good deal at $12 with a very large portion.  Now the bad..... We have visited probably at least 5 times, mostly for the half price sushi.  There's a serious lack of sushi options in this area so if we are in the mood I'll deal with it, even though its not great, the rice is at least really fresh tasting.  They seem to not be able to keep up with things when they are even slightly busy.  Yesterday, I had a server yesterday who was very flustered the whole time.  She took our drink order and 20 minutes later blamed it not arriving on the bartender (I ordered a Cosmo).  It arrived after I was clearly annoyed, and was straight vodka.  I like a stiff drink but this was not even drinkable!  The server told me that \"the bartender made it really strong because it took so long.\"  I told her I did not want it, and she took it off the bill.  Now to the food.  I ordered two rolls (spicy tuna & salmon).  It is very obvious that they use a ton of \"filler\" with their rolls.  There's  a lot of \"crunchy stuff\" (not sure what it is) where it's supposed to be fish.  My fiance ordered four rolls, but only two of four arrived.  She had no idea until we told her.  I finished eating mine, he finished two (still missing the other two)...and 20 minutes later the missing rolls appeared (it was a tuna roll and salmon roll.......pretty easy!!!)  So, he took it to go.  The server then blamed the sushi chefs.  I am not sure who was to blame here...the server, bartender or sushi chefs....but when a meal goes so horribly- at least some offer to make the experience better should've been offered.  She kept apologizing over and over, so it was very evident that things were bad- but she never involved a manager to smooth things over.  As a former server, being honest to your customers and your boss goes a long way.  If she would've admitted the wrong to both, they would've saved us as customers.  We won' t be back for a long time.  :("}
{"text":"Yuck. Not a place we will go again.  We went for lunch and I ordered off the lunch sushi menu. Basic spicy salmon and California rolls with a small salad. The sushi was warm and the seaweed was chewy. The flavor was way too fishy.  We also tried the Pad Thai and my partner took two bites and couldn't eat another. Talk about fishy. I don't know why it tasted like that - it was bad. The waitress told us people complain about it all the time and she used to tell people if they hadn't had it there before not to order it - but she wasn't allowed to any longer.  We had General Tso chicken to replace the Pad Thai - it was out quick but it tasted like what you get at the food court at the mall.  The service was decent but it didn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"I love this place!! They have affordable sushi and hot meals from stir fry to orange chicken. The servers are always really attentive and your food comes out quickly. My most recent discovery on their menu is the hot and sour soup. It is soo good!! I can't ever seem to have nothing more than an amazing meal here and both my family and my friends agree it's a great place for asain food in the Afton Ridge Shopping Center."}
{"text":"Changing my review after a few really bad experiences here. One time included bring brought the wrong dish 3 times Ina row and eventually having to eat after everyone else in my party was finished. Another time, my brother had his food and his child's food brought out with hair in it and they didn't even offer to remove any charges from his bill. They are very stingy here. If you have something go wrong don't expect anyone to apologize or compensate for it."}
{"text":"I ordered The Mei fun! They make theres in curry! Not really a fan of that spice but it was still good. I ordered the same dish the last time I ate here and asked them to make it without curry and it was better than ok. Will remember next time. They have very good sushi as well. Over all an above average asian restaurant!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with 1/2 priced sushi! Everyday after 8, they offer any sushi roll at half price. They give you the same amount as they would if you were paying full price, the quality is the same ( I have paid full price), and the sushi is consistent. The staff is alright, especially the older lady. She makes an attempt to make small talk and say thank you for coming. Only issue is that they get really  mad if you order something and don't like it whether it be a drink, sushi, an entree, etc. I know this is Asian food, but we are in AMERICA where we make a wrong dining experience right not get combative defending a dish........Other than that, I have no issues and would suggest this place in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the owners are awful.  There is a legal term for a company that fails to honor it's own Attractions coupons....BAIT AND SWITCH!  Making the manager and poor waitress apologize for your illegal behavior and failing to come over to the table to explain why you would not honor your own, non expired coupon is appalling.  It's a shame.  We liked your restaurant, but now that we understand your loathing for the regular customer....we will never be back.  Go to E. Noodles around the corner.  Better food, better service, and outstanding owners."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi tonight to go for the buy one get one free sushi from 4:00-9:30, picked my sushi up drove all the way home and they drenched my spider roll in SPICY MAYO.... okay first the spider roll does not include spicy mayo.. second my sushi was soggy from all the spicy mayo they decided to add without telling me, 20$ to waste!!!!"}
{"text":"I got the bento box. Bang bang shrimp and crab Rangoon were great. Sushi was okay wish there had more of a selection"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here about once a month. We add veggies and tofu to fried rice. The sushi is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Usually good service. I'm a fan of the bento boxes. Decent prices."}
{"text":"Went here accidentally after the restaurant we originally planned to go to was already closed for Christmas. It ended up working out great! We were having a small family dinner and the extra large booth was perfect for what we were looking for. Our server was friendly and attentive. We asked her a lot of questions about the wine and menu and she was very patient and answered every one. She even brought us samples of a couple of the wines since we were unsure. We ended up going with a bottle of the house wine which was okay but very cheap. The wine list is definitely something they could improve as it was pretty limited.  We started with the pork dumplings and they were delicious. Perfectly pan-fried as we asked for. I went with a bento box since it was such a good deal. So much food for only $12.95! Mine had garlic shrimp, brown rice, a florida crunch roll and a spring roll. I couldn't even finish it. Everyone I was with really enjoyed what they ordered and we couldn't believe how cheap the bill was for everything we ordered."}
{"text":"I've been to Asian cafe twice and everything has been completely average in both visits. Sushi rolls have been nothing special-not good but not awful. Chicken teryiaki was okay but chicken was a little bland. Service was friendly both times but didn't check often enough and food came out slowly. Half price sushi late night is the upside."}
{"text":"I have ate here several times. Everything is always great. Their basic sushi rolls like spicy tuna or crunchy shrimp are always great. The buy one, get a second free after 8 pm on a week night makes a great deal. Bento box, miso soup, bang bang shrimp, spring rolls, any noodle dishes are all very tasty as well. great service by all. I will continue to eat here once a week."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I've had their Chinese food, Japanese, and sushi!! Everything I have ate has been great! The staff is always very nice. Best sushi in the area hands down!"}
{"text":"This is a better alternative to Chinese food than say going to one of those sketch looking take out joints that have Asian names (ex. Royal dragon, happy garden, etc.). The food is okay and the prices are reasonable. They have all you can eat sushi but the last time I went the service was kinda slow. They're nice though"}
{"text":"This place was quite bad.  A mix of Chinese-American, Vietnamese-American, Japanese-American.  Calamari was not what it's name implies.  One inch long pieces of who-knows-what very fried, with little flavor.  Where were legs?  Rings?  I tasted no squid.  My rice plate of curried chicken was bland and sweet.  Every other dish was similar - overly sauced and sweet, which please the American palate and stomach.  None of the vegetables tasted fresh.  Big on baby corn, which is cheap and suck.  My daughter's sushi was o.k."}
{"text":"Good location for a quick sushi craving. Many rolls to chose from. We'll go again.  What else................... They have water, and a bar."}
{"text":"This is the closest you will get to authentic Chinese food in the area (I'm from New York and I know what real authentic Chinese food is suppose to LOOK and TASTE like). Everything is well portioned and the sushi is reasonable as well. Would recommend for lunchtime because its cheap!"}
{"text":"Oh Asian Café... where to begin???  I have been going to this place off and on for five years.  I have never taken the time to review it because I simply couldn't pinpoint what rating to give them as they were consistently inconsistent over the years.  It was like an abusive love/hate relationship that I kept trying to make work...  The food was always decent, but the service was either appalling or good.  Then Ben or Bennett? (I'm not sure exactly what his name is - even the hostess couldn't tell me which was correct when I asked) came along, and things have seemed to right themselves out.  I'm not sure what his position is, manager/owner/waiter-whatever, the service has improved significantly.  They have BOGO sushi Monday-Thursday which is a sweet deal as well as half priced sushi after 9 pm on the weekends.  They offer numerous crab rolls which is awesome for me, but might be redundant for others.  My only pet peeve with the place currently is that when I request soy sheet, my sushi falls apart!  I have never experienced this anywhere else.  It's annoying and not worth the upgrade charges, so I have been opting for boring old seaweed.  Their Chinese entrees are much better in quality and taste than Red Dragon or Chong Chin however, it'll cost you.  To give you an idea, General Tso's chicken with fried rice and an egg roll costs $12.95 for dinner at Asian Café.  If you prefer Japanese fare, their bento boxes are a great choice and come with many different options.  They do offer complimentary Chinese doughnuts on take out orders with five or more entrees."}
{"text":"Ginger salad- meh. Carolina roll- really tasty and fresh! Scallop and steak hibachi - well, I wouldn't get scallops again. They're flat and dried out. Steak is chewy. Someone else mentioned the carrots tasting like sweet potato and I agree. Overall the hibachi is disappointing.  The menu is large and the staff is friendly. I was in there for takeout on a Friday at 2:30 and it was empty. I would try it again. I wouldn't get hibachi again but I would get the carolina roll. I would try something different next time. Not the best in the area but not the worst."}
{"text":"It's a lazy night so I decided to let Asian Cafe do the cooking! I ordered Bourbon chicken with brown rice and a salad and for the kids I got sweet-and-sour chicken with fried rice. I usually get the bento box for $12.95 and you choose four items for your box.   I like this spot because it's always clean, the food is hot and fresh and the service is fast!  The downside is the menu needs to be redone because it's a little confusing, you don't know if the portion is for a single or a family.   Asian Cafe is a little more pricier than other Asian spots, but it's convenient so I patronize them; when in Rome do as the Romans do (conform)!"}
{"text":"Me and the boyfriend went to The Asian Cafe. It's tucked inside a plaza.   The wait wasn't long at all and the server was amazing and on top of it.  The boyfriend ordered a stir fry and loved it. I got sushi (and already forgot what type)... it wasn't horrible but nothing to write home about. It wasn't filling and felt a little warmer than it should've.  I wouldn't return for the sushi but the stir fry looked delicious."}
{"text":"I have to say, my fiancé and I came here for a good healthy vegan meal and man did we get it! Steamed veggies, steamed rice, veggie sushi and GREAT SERVICE. I am so happy and pleasantly surprised:D definitely coming back during the boho time period. The owner was super nice and the waitress too! Great experience!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Asian Cafe and I will definitely be back again! I came with a good friend of mine to grab drinks and some food.  We were greeted by the hostess who told us we could eat and drink right at the bar so there we went! I am new to sushi and our server Alex had no problem describing what was in each sushi roll for a newb like me! The manager Bennett brought out my bento box almost immediately (which was delicious and thanks Alex for helping me select my new favorite sushi roll). While dropping off our food, Bennett suggested I try a Moscow Mule, which was my first time trying a ginger beer, it was very good and I will definitely order more Moscow mules from now on! My experience at Asian Cafe was great, it's in a great cute location, I will definitely come back again and recommend it to more of my friends. Thanks Alex and Bennett for making my first time great"}
