{"text":"WOW, this place is fantastic!! A group of us went for dinner/dessert. Those of us who had dinner were pleasantly surprised at how delish the food was - and how filling! I had a bite of my friend's waffle - coconut ice cream on a waffle with coconut flakes and chocolate - OMG I was in heaven!! I love the fact that their ice cream is all homemade. Their service was amazing too. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Left feeling so full but wanting more. I will be back for sure to get more ice cream and to try some of their cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"I went here for a lunch chicken pesto crepe and sundae. Not only was the food good and affordable, but the atmosphere is inviting and the staff are exceptional. From the person who greeted us at the door to the person who brought us the food, they were all really gracious and even made some substitutes for me! Various staff kept coming over to see if we needed anything and my water glass was always full. In addition, I think the owner takes extra care in hiring people who are enthusiastic and love their job. I've been looking for a friendly casual restaurant to frequent in the Yonge/Eglinton neighbourhood and this is my new favourite spot! They have a new patio which is also great!"}
{"text":"Spin-Spin-Sugar for me please.

This place is like the musically inspired little sister of Caffe Demetre.
All the desserts are named with song titles!

* You Make Me Wanna
* One Sweet Day
* Another Day In Paradise

You can't help but feel nostalgic while reviewing the menu.

The crowd here was really young.  I wondered how many of the song titles they actually recognized.  Perhaps they should  name some desserts after Katy Perry or Flo Rida songs.  How about a sundae called \"Bad Romance\" for girls who want to eat their feelings.

I ordered the \"You Rock My World\" sundae.
A huge scoop of sticky toffee ice cream, Skor bits, smothered in caramel sauce.  It was pretty fantastic! =)

In addition to crepes, waffles, and sundaes, they have pies and cakes available.  I was surprised to see Cheesecake Factory cheesecake!  I couldn't resist and I ordered a slice of Godiva Double Chocolate cheesecake for carry-out. =)

As for savory hot food, they have some items available.  
However, unless you are absolutely in need of sustenance, I'd stick with dessert.
The chicken pesto wrap smelled delicious, but it was disappointing.  The crepe was doughy, undercooked, flavourless... and pretty unappetizing.
Served piping hot straight from the microwave.

I'd stay away from the non-dessert items.  Decent dessert but I'm not sure I'd make the trip to return here...unless it's for Godiva Chocolate cheesecake."}
{"text":"This is more than just a dessert cafe, although the variety of sweets and cake selections at the entrance is enough for you to come here. The ambience is pretty nice with some cozy,  private booths. On this night, we had a big group of almost 13 so tables were put together to accomodate.

I just had an espresso machiato so can't say too much about the food, however, the menu is extensive with salads and sandwhiches, drinks (including booze) and coffee's. My friend ordered a salad and he said it was not bad.

We had a waitress who did a fine job ensuring everyone was okay so no complaints about service, and especially because we were such a large group. We pretty much stayed until closing time, so FYI, if you are looking for a place that closes really late, then you should come to Spin Cafe. I believe on certain days, the place closes at 2AM (Saturday's in any event)."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here on a Saturday evening after purchasing a coupon from Dealicious. Immediately we notice the atmosphere is very nice and the staff friendly and attentive. We had a $40 coupon so we ordered the \"You make me wanna\" waffle with ice cream and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake to share, along with a mangocream for myself and chocolate monkey to drink for him. The food and drinks arrived quickly and the portions were huge! Everything was deliciously decadent. We could barely finish the desserts and still had money left on our coupon, so we ordered a Bollywood pizza to go (thin crust which I like). The pizza was loaded with cheese, chicken and veggies, it was pretty tasty and difference from any pizzas I've had before. Our server constantly checked on us and was very considerate throughout the meal. Will definitely go back for more desserts and maybe try a few dishes as well."}
{"text":"Waffle and ice cream is pretty good there, huge scoop of ice cream and loaded with fruits, I find that some places skimp on the toppings but this place doesn't. 

i've also tried the savory crepe, prosciutto, goat cheese, greens and it was delicious.

Each time I have been there service was pretty good. Will continue to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday lunch and am looking forward to going back.  We were able to sit outside and enjoy the breeze, and our server was quick to take our order.  Our crepes arrived fairly quickly, and everyone was pleased with his or her choice.  I got the chicken pesto crepe, while my friends chose the thai chicken crepe, which they said was quite spicy but good.  

As a birthday treat, we ordered a slice of carrot cake and a slice of red velvet cake to share.  The server even brought out a candle to light, but unfortunately, the wind blew it out before my friend could do so.  It was a nice gesture anyway.  Delicious cake, and the side of ice cream was a perfect added touch."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast/brunch.  Totally empty.  Should have seen it as a sign.  Ordered 2 crepes (one each) and a latte.  Bill was $27+ and the crepes were cold when they arrived at the table.  Very, very mediocre food.  Bad menu. Simply cannot survive in this location.  Will never return."}
{"text":"The worst thing about Sp!n is the service. 

My friend and I, the only ones in there, sit down at this \"cafe.\" So, when the waitress takes our order I say  I want a caramel latte, made with skim milk. She says \"I don't know if we have that.\" Then says \"I'll go check.\" So then she comes back and says they don't have anything except cream and soy milk. I then ask if they have milk for their plain coffee, which she also doesn't know and proceeds to bring me a little plastic individual milk packet and says \"this is the kind we have.\" It's 2%. How hard is it to say, \"we have 2% milk?\" Anyway, I order a Caramel Americano (no milk) and she brings me the Latte instead. The best part is that she wrote our orders down. I know maybe I was being a bit difficult but even at McDonald's they know the difference between milk and cream!

The latte itself was disgustingly sweet and almost undrinkable. Starbucks - and even Tim Hortons - make better lattes.

I wouldn't recommend going here for coffee, competent service or a good time. Have no idea about the desserts."}
{"text":"I've been to Spin for lunch and I've been there for dessert in the evening.  Lunch was pathetic.  I had a pesto chicken crepe.  The crepe was rubbery and the chicken was fake.  I'm not even kidding - it was this horrible processed stuff that I'm assuming they just heat up.  It was solid white and spongy.  

Dessert however, was pretty good.  I had a molten lava chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, and I have to say it was pretty awesome.  Most of the desserts (even the sundaes) come in at or over $10 when you consider tax and tip, which I think is a bit much, but they are also huge portions.

I'll go back, but never for anything other than dessert.  They need to either correct the problems with their meal crepes or remove them from the menu altogether.  Also, just a comment, but a couple of the 5 star reviews of this establishment reek of \"playing with the system\".   You aren't fooling anyone.  Hopefully Yelp's system will filter out those reviews soon."}
