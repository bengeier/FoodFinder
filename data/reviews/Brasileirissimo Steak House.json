{"text":"As a Brazilian from Rio I must say I felt like I'm in Downtown Rio eating a traditional meal food around there which sounds just awesome. The staff is awesome, the place is awesome and be sure you will eat a lot and very well."}
{"text":"My family and I are visiting Toronto and we were looking for Italian food but based on the yelp reviews we decided to give this place a try. Yummy...Simple meals but delicious, the beans, rice, and picanha reminded me of having lunch in Brazil. Great service, the server even brought a side of rice and beans for my one-year-old son, he devoured the food (great sign)! The passion fruit mousse had the right balance of fruit and sweetness. Loved it!!!"}
