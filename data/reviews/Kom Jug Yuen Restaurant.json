{"text":"The BBQ can be decent but is offset by overtly hostile service and the nasty little tricks this place frequently pulls if you don't speak Mandarin or Cantonese.  Watch out for the following:  1. Packing too much BBQ in your take-out order. Your 1lb.of  BBQ pork often become 1,5lbs. and is charged for accordingly.  2. They often slip fatty pieces and/or leftover ends in your takeout order if you are not watching them and won't discover that until you open the box. I have had them also do that in the restaurant and scowl at you when you send it back.  All in all the phrase\"customer service\" does not exist in Kom Jug Yuen's vocabulary."}
{"text":"New owners here as many have already mentioned.  This place was one of two restaurants that opened here on Spadina in the mid 70s.  At that time, Chinatown was on Dundas congregated around Elizabeth.  I went often back in the day.  I returned a few times over the last 3 years.  I won't be going again after I finish this review.  The cooked food - the quality is VERY uneven.    The BBQ food - the stuff hanging in the front windows - BEWARE - if it didn't sell today, it'll be hanging back up there tomorrow.  I'm surprised no one has died from this yet.  They are not the only ones that do this.  New Hong Fatt also does it.  Other BBQ restaurants such as Kings Noodles and House of Gourmet do not.  The unventilated basement bathroom has headroom of about 5 feet.  The place is dirtier than any place I've seen and that includes the worst sidewalk eateries in Kowloon."}
{"text":"A couple months ago, this place went under new management and everything went down the drain.  On my last visit, I ordered my usual pork fried rice to go, but ended up throwing half of it out. It was mushy, flavourless, and overall unpleasant. A shadow of its former self, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Too bad. This place used to be a great place for a quick and cheap meal of BBQ pork on rice. The old owners really knew their BBQ. I've eaten a lot of BBQ pork in my time and their \"half fat, half lean\" pork was some of the best I've had anywhere. Now, it's too lean, unevenly chopped, portion size is down, price is up and no more free house soup. I just finished my plate and I am still hungry. Sadly, it'll be my last visit here."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves decent BBQ foods, however items other than BBQ is barely satisfactory, and the depressing dining environment is a huge turn down."}
{"text":"Recommended Dish: Would not recommend any dish.....  Reviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 0 / 5 Cooking speed: 0 / 5 Food Quality: 1 / 5 Food Quantity: 0 / 5 Price: 0 / 5  Cleanness: 1 / 5  Repeat: NO  The place had been in business since mid 90s, I thought it cannot be that bad..... could it? I took a seat and there's only 1 cook for the whole restaurant. He also take orders, cut up the BBQ and cook other dishes in the back?  I waited for over 15 min (without service) until the waitress walked in and start taking orders, so I picked a easy dish that can be served quickly (BBQ pork and Chicken on rice), all he have to do is cut up the meat and scoop up the rice. Fast forward another 20 minutes, the waitress checked on my order, but the cook refuses to prepare this simple dish until he finished with another table of 6 (with much more complicated orders).   Fast forward another 15 minutes, the dish finally arrived. It was a bitter disappointment...... the BBQ pork is cold, the chicken is wet and warm (as if it was pulled from a bucket of hot water). Normally you would expect the meat is neatly cut, but every piece of meat on this dish is a different size and thickness! And both meat are bland and tasteless. The worst part is it's more expensive (for the same dish) than restaurants near Dundas and Spadina.  Avoid the sweat and sour pork here, I saw the cook walk to the back with a covered dish. Then come out 1 minute later with a ready to eat sweat and sour pork with sauce on top. I think he just microwaved the meat and pour on the sauce, it would be impossible to fry the meat in less than 1 minute.  Strongly recommend to walk south to Dundas and Spadina and there are much better choices there!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars Highlights:      Kom Jug Yuen or simply 'Kom Jug', as I refer to it, was a find thanks to an Elite yelper (Payam Z.) and it became an instant hit amongst (hesitant) friends. (there's something about the name I guess.)   And not necessarily because this place serves the best chinese food, and nor does it have the best of service (they'll just bring you a pen and paper and you take your own orders), but because:   1) Kom Jug is always open (don't pay any attention to the business hours listed).  2) Food is served real quick.  3) The food isn't bad at all.  4) Most items are around 5 bucks   5) Portion sizes are great.  6) And lastly, there's never a dull moment at Kom Jug!   Tips:     1)Try either the chicken fried rice, crispy beef, BBQ pork, or the Szechuan chicken (if you get this without rice, you'll get a massive plate of chicken enough to feed four!)  2) Arrive super late... after 1 am.  3) Sit close to the kitchen door and listen to every sound that comes out of the kitchen!  4) Don't even think about going to the bathroom!  5) Never go sober!  Bottom line:  Food: A- Service: F (see above) Food presentation: B Atmosphere: C+ Prices: A+ Recommended?:  Yes, perfect as a preventative measure against hangovers."}
{"text":"I have always loved coming here, my father brought me the first time probably about 8 years ago, always got the hot and sour soup and general chows chicken on rice or the sesame beef. But the past year and a half since the business has been sold it's been awful the beef greasy. The chicken too chewy and gummy. But yesterday topped it all off, went to order out to give it one last chance and saw two cockroaches, one right on the hot food counter and the other practically ran over the guys hand at the cash and he didn't flinch!!! I told them to cancel my order and left immediately...."}
{"text":"As others have stated, used to be MUCH better. Only 1 guy working in the whole place! So, it took quite some time for meals to get cooked and served, but hats off to the poor guy who was working his tail off. As a newcomer, you'd probably find nothing \"wrong\" with the food, but if you are an old regular like I was then the food is not good in comparison to what it used to be. The BBQ pork is nowhere as good. I was also disappointed with a noodle dish and a cooked vegetables fish that I ordered. Again, nothing terribly \"wrong\" with the food, but a pale shadow of what it used to be. The menu looks unchanged despite the new ownership, so, who knows, maybe they might make some dishes just as good or better than the previous owners."}
{"text":"\"Best BBQ Pork in North America\" is a bold statement... especially when you consider the fact that North America encompasses Canada, the U.S., and Mexico... AND, you consider the fact that you're entering a restaurant named Kom Jug (hilarity!)... AND, you consider the fact that it looks like it looks.  I've eaten BBQ all over North America.  Is this BBQ the best of three countries?  I don't think it matters.  However, this statement alone piqued my interest.  The decor is everything I want from a rundown Chinese restaurant.  Old, old, old... the kind of place that makes you question whether or not you should actually be eating there.  I've only had the $4 BBQ pork, and I had it to go after a night of drinking.  It's not the kind of beauty that would turn Sparta against Troy, but it was tasty enough for late night... and you get a lot of it for two toonies.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"During my two-year stint at UofT I probably hit up The Jug no less than a hundred times, typically for a quick dinner (often supplemented by a Vietnamese sandwich from one of many shops further south on Spadina).    As many reviewers have already mentioned, the BBQ pork is the main draw - which I've found to be tender, glistening with a mild sweet sauce, and appropriately fatty about 75% of the time.  If you're lucky, they even throw in a piece of bok choy to ease the guilt that comes from a massive protein binge.  Unfortunately, during the other 25%, the meat was tough, dry, and a bit tasteless.  The fact that I continued to return on a regular basis despite the inconsistency is a testament to just how good the pork is at its best.    The only other dish I've tried is the hot-and-sour soup, which is hearty, filling, though on occasion spiked with an unnecessary amount of sugar."}
{"text":"I grew up around the corner on Huron St - back in the 70's to the late 90's, it was our place to go and grab a great bowl of noodle soup with bbq meat (usually under $5). A great place for UofT students to grab dinner instead of having to cook for oneself!  One of the dirtiest-looking restaurants in town, but you couldn't beat their prices and the taste of their dishes.  That was then ...fast-forward 30+ years and original owners have retired - even their BBQ has gone downhill.  KJY used boast having the best BBQ pork in North America - and I agree!  When we used to go, I made sure I never had to use their bathroom - God forbid!  you may fall down the very narrow stairs but if you did make it downstairs, you would have to plug your nose in case you pass out from the horrid stench!  I never had a bad dish there ...now that I've moved to Scarborough, there is no need anymore (unfortunately) to return for good BBQ meats."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience not at, but ancillary to eating at Kom Jug Yuen.  Walking through Chinatown with a friend, looking for a good restaurant to try, we were stopped by a strange old man, who asked if we were tourists.  We explained that we were looking for a good, authentic Chinese restaurant, and he, bubbling over with excitement, began to tell us about his favourite restaurant on Spadina, Kom Jug Yuen!    He walked us there and on the way told a story about how he found somebody's wallet and returned it and got in the newspaper, he even had newspaper clippings of his story!  He brought us right into the restaurant and talked to someone he knew at the front, told them to take care of us, and it was an utterly hilarious and nice way to be introduced to a restaurant.  It's extremely cheap, and delicious food, we split the hot and sour soup and the BBQ pork fried rice and they were both quite good for under 5 bucks each.    The decor is composed mainly of confusingly written and priced specials, and not much redeeming decor.  It's not terribly unclean, but it's far from impeccable.  There are better places, but if you are nearby and looking for cheap eats, give the Kom Jug a try."}
{"text":"Excellent prices and pretty good food.  grew up there. Needs cleaner washrooms though."}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place is cheap. The sign out front says \"Best BBQ Pork in North America\" but it should really say \"Kom Jug: Best Bang for Your Buck.\" (Har, har.)  For $4, I had their famed BBQ pork on a bucketload of rice. Even after I shoved several spoonfuls onto Kat F's plate, I couldn't polish off the rice and struggled to finish the 'cue. Some of it was dry, some super-fatty but when I hit a piece of pork that had the right meat-to-fat ratio, it was pretty good. Not the best but for 2 twoonies, it's a steal.  The plate comes garnished with two pieces of steamed broccoli -- as if that's going to offset all the cardio damage from the pork fat.  The meal included a basinful of tepid soup for our Yelp party of 7, hot tea, and orange wedges and fortune cookies for dessert.  All that for 4 fricking dollars! My post-dinner smoothie cost more than that."}
{"text":"run down hole in the wall with cheap eats. strange staff...  make sure you check you got what you actually ordered. speedy and open late - worth checking out."}
{"text":"DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT go to the washroom here.  DO NOT touch anything.  Wipe down your cutlery.  Look straight ahead and do not draw attention to yourself.  Do not catch the eye of anyone who has just been to the washroom, what you see may make you lose your nerve.  This place has very cheap food which can sometimes taste good.  You may or may not get soup with your meal at the whim of the waiter.  You may or may not get a wedge of fresh orange for dessert.  Maybe a fortune cookie.  It depends.  The owners (Mr. and Mrs.) and probably the servers will treat you with contempt.  You may have to share a table with somebody really obnoxious who sniffles and picks his teeth, there is no option on this.  Leave a CONSPICUOUS tip or the Mrs. will scream at you in Chinese.  Head for the door immediately after eating."}
{"text":"Great bbq pork, probably the best in Toronto.  BBQ pork fried rice is a great deal, cheap and abundant!  Don't go to the washroom, it's like a scene from Twilight Zone!!"}
{"text":"After hitting up the Hot Box Cafe, a five minute walk from Kom Jug Yuen, my brother and I set out for a cheap-pre-club-meal on a Saturday night; Luckily, or not (depending on how you look at it), we stumbled upon Kum Jug.  What was I wearing? Black Sports Jacket by Hugo Boss, white dress shirt by Jean Paul Gaultier, silver tie (in a half-windsor) by Armani, black trousers by Hugo Boss, black dress socks (Calvin Klein), patent-leather dress shoes (Calvin Klein), and boxer briefs (also by Calvin Klein).  At first I was slightly taken aback by the euphemism of the restaurant's title (i.e. alluding to a 'jug full of spermatozoa'). However, what we found inside was apparently even stranger than the restaurant's name. For starters, the term 'Hole-In-The-Wall' does not even begin to describe this place; When you enter Kum Jug it is, both literally and figuratively, like peering inside a homeless Chinaman's rectum. Unfortunately however, words cannot accurately describe Kum Jug to you; This is because, plainly speaking, Kum Jug is a visceral, physical, and emotional experience all at once. Words simply fail to do it justice. What I will tell you is that if you are feeling especially bold, I suggest taking a visit to the washroom in the basement. It is very similar to the rest of the restaurant but only with more feces on the floor and walls.  With respect to the menu; it is almost entirely in Chinese except for one item - 'Pork and Noodle'. My brother and I were about to order this but the 'server' brought two orders of it out to us before we even had a chance to. Weird. I found out later, from a veteran-patron of Kum Jug, that they always automatically bring out an order of 'Pork and Noodle' to white people. Interesting. Here's where things get even weirder though; the 'Pork and Noodle' actually tasted okay, was very filling, and only cost about $4.  So, after all of the negativity in my review, you are probably thinking that I would not recommend Kum-Jug to you; However, my suggestion is precisely the opposite; Stop what you are doing, do yourself a favor, head to Kum-Jug now (before it is shut down by Toronto Public Health). You will feel dirty afterwards, you may get a tapeworm, but make no mistake - it is the full Kum-Jug experience..."}
{"text":"I've been going to KJY for years now and it's always been great. But this most recent time I knew something was fishy when I realize that the menus had been lamented ( KJY doesn't update anything). Long story short, the crispy spicy beef was excellent as usual but my other staple - chicken fried rice, was a let down. The flavour wasn't the same and some of the chicken pieces seemed a little rancid. To top it all off a roach decided to join me and my guest for dinner.   Thankfully the meal was comp'd but I don't think I'll be returning after this experience."}
{"text":"First, this was never Kom Kuk Yuen.  Kom Jug Yuen has been there since I was a kid in the early 80s and much before that.  The owner (Ping) is the nicest guy, very friendly.  The only BBQ pork that came close was Hong Fatt which closed down a couple of year's again and was re-labelled New Hong Fatt Restaurant.   Kom Jug Yuen's BBQ pork is a perfect balance of caramel, charred fatty bits and never dry.  The duck is easily better than many joints I've tried in Markham, it complements the pork very nicely.  For something different, the restaurant makes a good Cantonese Fried Noodle.    For those who say this place isn't the best BBQ pork in the city have no clue what they're talking about."}
{"text":"So my friend and I finally make it to Toronto and what's the first thing to do? Go to Chinatown and eat of course! After getting some bubble tea and feeling happy about where we are (all day dim sum, all you can eat Japanese food, unlimited hot pot, etc) we were salivating! We walked by Sang's which had ridiculous deals (mussels in black bean sauce for $2.99?!) when we stumbled upon this place. BBQ fried rice for $4? Sold!  My friend got the roast pork and rice while I got the bbq pork and duck with rice. We also shared a fish congee which was absolutely delicious. Actually all three meats was great, the roast pork skin had excellent crisp, the bbq pork (not sure if it's the best in North America as they claim, but it's darn good) was flavorful, sweet, and juicy, and the duck was excellent. Portions was generous, the congee bowl ended up 2-3 cups for each of us. The fish and ginger in the congee had a crisp flavor, and the congee smooth down the hatch.  The best part? The bill was under $15. Instant classic in my book."}
{"text":"If you order anything other than BBQ you're taking a big risk. Don't say I didn't warn you.  Last week we ordered takeout, consisted of   Lemon Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Flat Rice Noodle with Beef Roast Pork with Rice   My take,  Lemon chicken, chicken was dried and the lemon sauce straight out of a can. It was over fried, oil was old and brown. Yuck!  Chicken fried rice - use of day old rice, frozen peas and carrots , fried with lots of oil and heavy pour of soy sauce. Not appetizing.  Flat rice noodles with beef. An overcooked mush. The noodles didn't want to separate.   Roast pork  BBQ was good, which is the saving grace of the place. The skin was crispy and the meat was fresh and cooked well. You don't get a lot of pork for the $5 (5-6 slices) but you sure do get a lot of rice in the box to carb up.   The interior is tack to the max. Feels so grungy and cheap. The specials can be found pasted on florescent pink bristol boards around the inside perimeter of the restaurant. It's so impractical because if someone is eating at a table with a special behind them do you care to ask them to move their head to read them?  C'mon nooo..  I'm surprised no one in the group got ill from this restaurant adventure in Chinatown."}
{"text":"There are two things you need to keep in mind for a good experience at the Jug:  1. Bring cash and patience. They don't take cards, and while your food won't take forever to arrive, it won't appear in mere moments and it may not appear in traditional order (nibbly appetiser things followed by bigger dishes).  2. When you order, don't say \"barbecued pork\", say \"LEAN barbecued pork\". By doing so, you'll get much more cosistently meaty, less fatty chunks of toe-curlingly, knee-weakeningly good roasted pig.   Get a plate of green beans with chili and garlic; they're fresh, bright green, crunchy (not overcooked), and delicious. If that doesn't appeal to you (what's wrong with you?!), the snow pea greens are excellent, as are the Chinese mushrooms and Chinese greens. You get a lot of well-made, delicious food for very little money. Bring friends or prepare to take home leftovers!"}
{"text":"everyone else is eating bbq pork at kum jugs.. i always come for the bbq duck. ooooh yesssss, its good !! for $4 you get half a duck, on rice with a few green chinese brocollis on the side. its juicy, its spiced the perfect way, its just so great.   for the sake of full disclosure,, i can't remember ever ordering anything but the duck, so im no judge of that..  and i should also mention that one late night many years ago , a dear friend of mine, threw up at the table at 3am after a night of fun, and the server ran over with a giant plate to catch it on.. and didn't kick her out after that. if thats not great service, i don't know what is."}
{"text":"The high level of cheap Chinese in Toronto is really quite awesome.  I dropped in here for a quick take-out lunch of roast pork over rice, which was perfectly done and came in at about 6 bucks.  I'm sure the other specials are equally good, so don't skip this one because of lack of ambiance."}
{"text":"I have to put this place down after the way my friend and I have been served here. We've been there before a few years ago, it was delicious and juicy, used to love it, but the last time I went in 2015 we ordered BBQ pork on rice as per usual, simple, straightforward order, the most classic basic, usual and casual order you can make in this specific place, right? WRONG! The guy just starts cooking up something for 20 mins, and ends up serving us pork with black bean sauce and mushrooms.... WTF?! This is nothing like what we ordered! My friend tells him \"no... BBQ pork on rice....\" the guy hears him and agrees and goes \"Yeah! BBQ pork black bean sauce!\" What?! What?! How...?! Why...?! Like, how did you mess that up? And he denies everything, he just tells us that it's good, we should try it! Dude... that's not what we want at all... we don't want stupid veggies drowned in nasty black sauce, we wanted simple juicy BBQ pork on rice, the dish the place is famous for, how in the hell can you mess that up?! That's like going to McDonald's to order a burger and they serve you a falafel! Like where did that even come from?! Where would he get such an idea! The guy didn't get our order at all, and he tells us to just deal with what he gave us, no apology, no effort! Just, WTF! I was so turned off, for shame, this place is dead to me now :( So long Kom Jug Yuen, I hardly knew ye."}
{"text":"This place use to be on Dundas St. and call Kom Kuk Yuen. Then i believe they sold it under the same name and opened in the current venue which has been there at least since the early 90's. Its a place where time has stood still like much of old chinatown. Same decor, same staff (grecian formula touchup), same food, different prices. You think with the strong canadian dollar prices would be the same or better. $7.50 for a rice noodle soup with roasted duck leg - must be the right leg.   Roast pork (lechon) is very good, if not better than that of the Peak restaurant in First Markham Place, moist, crispy skin, no urea residue from pig, not overly seasoned. Let me assure you i know my lechon - read my review of lechon from my visit to Peurto Rico. The roast pork is a 5 star, the rest should have been left behind."}
{"text":"Kom Jug Yuen serves tasty food for cheap price (for downtown standards)... But not the \"best\" since I've been spoiled living in Markham surrounded by even better food and cheaper. Been here a few times for take away and I won't have to cook for a few days.  Usual Order: - Pork barbeque good, but not the best - Roast pork nice and cripy, but oily - Stir fried chinese brocolli standard veggie, just need something else from all the meat - Beef brisket noodle soup good flavour and soft beef  Efficient staff - once in a while you get a smile or two. The cash register, bbq's and noodle station are right at the entry.The space is small, but they pack it with a good amount of tables and chairs.   I would never sit in and eat there nor would I dare use their washroom. It's strictly take away place for me."}
{"text":"A truly unfortunate name for a restaurant. I still can't order the egg white soup here.  You get what you pay for... but still not the worse in Chinatown. Very reasonable compared to the rest of the over inflated prices of other restaurants.  A great place for sad, lonely people who don't want to be seen eating by themselves."}
{"text":"Best BBQ pork in North America?  Bold statement. Not necessarily true.   That said, if it's late and you're hungry, and you've got about $5 in your pocket this is certainly the place. BBQ pork on rice with a handful of snow peas is filling and flavourful, especially when splashed with a packet of hot sauce.   I'm sure it'll be a treat after a night out and too much dough spent on drinks."}
{"text":"This must be the first time that Yelp has steered me wrong! After traveling many miles to try Toronto's Chinese cuisine, I was disappointed by the sampling I had at Kom Jug Yuen. The atmosphere isn't the cleanest or nicest, but I am willing to over look that for good food. This would definitely qualify for a hole in the wall.   I am not sure if our California Cantonese dialect is different than Toronto's,  but no one at this restaurant understood anything we were trying to order! For a party of 6 this is what we managed to order:   - Salt and pepper spareribs - not salty and not really what we are used to eating in the Bay Area. It was almost wet, instead of dry and fried. - Pea sprouts and Chinese mushrooms - they ran out of pea sprouts and I had baby bok choy instead. It was the smallest bok choy I have ever tried.  - Crispy chicken - already cooked and likely dumped back in the fryer to get it warm. Super duper dry of course then. Ordered a whole chicken, but it was chopped up and dumped together as if there were 2 different half chickens on the plate, leaving minimal dark meat. - Famous BBQ pork with roast duck - BBQ was decent, but nothing to rave about. Only a few duck pieces on the plate.  - Beef dish with onions - Ok, but nothing special.  - Pan fried noodles - never came, so we just canceled it.   Service was ridiculously bad, even for a Chinese restaurant.  Look, I know how it is, but still, this was bad. He kept asking if we were ready, but never stopped to take our order. Maybe he was waiting for us to write down an order? He never said.   Funniest part of the adventure? A Chinese man stopped us before going in, warning us not to go here and to try another location down the block. Trusting Yelp and our hungry stomachs, we decided to ignore the stranger but try Kom Jug Yuen out. Guess the stranger was more of a prophecy than we expected.   If you actually do try this place to satisfy your curiosity, here are a few tips:  - Write your order on the blank bill they leave you on the table. This is apparently the unspoken way to order.  - Order in English.  - Don't touch anything inside. Probably take it to go."}
{"text":"kom jug yuen is one of many chinese restaurants on spadina. the food is greasy but it usually hits the spot late at night. there are a lot of items on the menu but I have only tried fried rice chicken & the bbq pork with rice and I like both considering the price. overall if you're in the neighbourhood and looking for something cheap, quick and greasy tasty, then go to kom jug yuen."}
{"text":"This place IS Chinese food. IT IS THE REAL THING!  They have the BEST Chinese Bar BQ Pork, Duck and Chicken in town.  When you go regularly you will discover the Pan Fried Dumplings are HUGE and tasty.  The dishes are all cooked quickly and with fresh ingredients.  I recommend the Pan Fried Dumplings, Shanghai Noodles, Bar BQ mixed platter, the Yang Chow Fried Rice to start.  Do give it a try..;."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago in search of a new Chinese spot. Got the standard BBQ pork along with chicken wings (not a lot of wing meat) And a noodle dish. Everything was super greasy. Even by Chinatown standards the service was pretty horrendous. There are lots of better options on this strip. Choose wisely!"}
{"text":"Goddamnit. Best BBQ pork in the city and then they get a shout out from the health unit for violations. Greaaaaaaaaat."}
{"text":"There has been change in ownership here. This used to be one of the city's go-to places for cheap eats. Now prices have skyrocketed and portion size has gotten smaller. This place was never the nicest or the cleanest but they had cheap good food to make up for it. Now they got nothing going on for them."}
{"text":"It was probably a bad sign when the guy manning the register (and who is also the cook) fell asleep when I peaked inside the window.  Okay, so it was 4:30 p.m. and may be it's quiet time.  The roast pork hanging in front of the window looked pretty good (or my wife and I were just very hungry). We ventured in.  I don't mind the restaurant looks like it's from the 1970s and having never been redone.  But when my roast pork with chicken rice came out, it was horrific.  He gave me odds and ends of the roast pork that was sitting there on his cutting board is my guess.  The chicken also looked like it was odds and ends.  Worse, my wife saw him put it in the microwave to heat up my food.  I felt sorry for the two customers that came in after us.  Never again."}
{"text":"Either I have unique taste buds or I walked into another restaurant that was NOT Kom Jug Yuen.  I came here after my disappointment in finding that Anh Dao, the Vietnamese restaurant was closed.  It is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant for dining on the cheap.  It was mostly non-Chinese dining here and students.  Various combos of their barbecued items came with rice for a cost of $4.  Great place for the budget-conscious eater.    Upon ordering we were brought a bowl of Tofu and Wintermelon Soup.  It was quite a savory broth-based soup.  Light and refreshing. Winter melons are supposedly good for staving off acne.  We ordered a small Mixed BBQ Platter which consisted of their \"famous\" BBQ pork, soy sauce chicken and roast duck.  The BBQ pork was flavourful but nothing about it stood out. In fact I found the marinade was a bit on the light side and therefore didn't have any depth in flavor. With that said it was tasty. The roast duck was the most disappointing - a crispy skin was absent. Chicken was ok.  The Pineapple and Beef Fried Rice was an epic fail. This is probably THE worst fried rice I've ever tasted. The moment the rice arrived I already noticed its soggy texture.  Clearly it was not made from day-old rice.  Think making French toast without day-old bread. There was something about the pineapple that was off... Canned pineapple perhaps? I can't quite put my finger on it.  The entire dish was bland. As we looked around no table in sight ordered fried rice - mostly noodles and plain rice.  Moral of the story - scope out what other people are eating first to get a consensus on what the popular dishes are.  Since they had sold out of Pea Shoot and Shiitake Mushroom Stir-Fry we opted for Baby Bok Choy.  Again, nothing to Yelp about. I found their mushrooms tasted a bit weird.  Verdict:  Total after tax and tip was $35.  A fortune cookie is presented with your bill - can this restaurant be any less authentic?  The service was less than stellar and after the Mixed BBQ Platter (which requires only chopping), the dishes came out at a snail's pace.  The food here is definitely disappointing and with all the other amazing restaurants to choose from in Chinatown I will definitely not be returing to Kom Jug Yuen again."}
{"text":"The decor is a bit \"saw\" like with cardboard from the dollar store with menu items and specials taped to the wall (all in Chinese!). I think the old lady that sits at the front yelling at the workers is really funny!   Table of 6; we ordered fried rice, fried noodles, their famous bbq pork, egg rolls, chicken balls, veggie stir-fry and everything was better than many places! Great tasting and they make the food very quickly! Comes out piping hot from the kitchen! The quality of the food does not match the atmosphere.  If you want a great place to stop after the bars this is a perfect place. However, don't take a first date lol Good portion sizes for groups and even had lots left over to take away - to boot, all for $60! Bargain!!  Tips:   Make sure you try the bbq pork!   Don't go to the bathroom!"}
{"text":"Despite it's questionable name, Kom Jug is the epitome of dirty cheap. It's a ghetto hole in the wall place that serves surprisingly tasty food for really good prices. If you're a foodie, this place may not be the spot to find multi-layered flavours in ever bite or plating styles of Susur Lee.  You get a big plate of white rice with BBQ goodness on top for 6 bucks. Duck, Chicken and Pork are the highlights here. Although they may have fudged a bit with their claim of having the best BBQ pork in town, I think people find it true when considering the price and quantity.   I usually go around lunch time when local business owners, residents and business men are in. It's nice to see a place that caters to all walks of life, that's not too common anywhere else.  So does it taste good? Yes it does!  It's also very affordable which is a big plus and the service is fine as well.  Kom Jug is a different kind of restaurant and a successful business. I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Kom Jug is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. They claim to have the best BBQ pork in North America and while I can't corroborate that claim it is pretty good.  It's not the nicest or fanciest places but it is very inexpensive and the portions are large. For a university student such as myself that is a great asset. The food quality is pretty good and besides the aforementioned BBQ pork they also make decent Thai noodles and won ton soup. The General Gao's (or whoever) chicken is also very tasty.  I'd definitely recommend this restaurant. For the price I haven't found a better place in a Chinatown."}
{"text":"If you're on a student budget, or haven't showered in a week, than this is your friendly place for some Chinese comfort food. No-frill, greasy, MSG-laden, BBQ goodness. Check your expectations at the door and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The new owners really messed this place up. A lot more expensive and the food just doesn't taste the same."}
{"text":"Julie   I bookmarked this spot knowing that I was visiting TO. It's said to have the best bbq roast pork and the sign also advertises it. I was skeptical cause if it really was the best, I would have expected lines and for it to cost more than the $4 bucks I paid. Yep, you get a bbq roast pork over rice for $4 bucks....   Don't get me wrong... It was good, but still a bit fatty. The pieces also weren't cut well and some were just way too thick and chewy... It's a bargain at $4 so I got some tofu as well... Also ok, but honestly, I get the same at NYC's chinatown for just as cheap. I guess I was expecting Hong Kong style goodness...   The spot is ghetto... a bunch of tables with a large menu selection that won't hurt the wallet. It's one of those typical late night sober up spots to get cheap good food. I'd compare it to Noodle Town in NYC's chinatown, who also has good food done cheap..."}
{"text":"I used to love the BBQ pork here but not since the owners have changed. I bought some recently for dinner with my parents, not realizing that they were under new management. They gave me only the fattiest pork and the flavour was lacking. My mom complained about it all through dinner and only afterwards, did my dad tell us that the restaurant had changed hands. Apparently the previous owners had offered to teach the new owners their recipe, but the new owners refused. *sigh* guess I'll have to start looking for my new favourite bbq pork in the GTA"}
{"text":"After 10+ years of walking by this place and making jokes about the name, I finally drank the juice from the mighty \"Cum Jug\"!!!  A group of 7 Yelpers hit this spot up in search of the \"Best BBQ Pork in North America\".  Some sort of award was bestowed upon Cum Jug in 2008 declaring it the best BBQ Pork in North America.  I'm not sure how official the ranking is, but there really was an award, not just smoke blowing.  Unfortunately, this place wasn't exactly the best I've had, though not bad either.  The BBQ pork was inconsistent from piece to piece, it was a bit of a grab bag -- burnt bits, moist pieces, fatty pieces, etc.  For the price - $4 for a big plate with rice, you can't really go wrong.  I opted for the Holy Trinity of carnivorous meals -- the BBQ pork, duck, and soya sauce chicken combo.  It was a beast but I polished it off with no grain left standing.  The duck wasn't great, the skin was too soggy.  The soya sauce chicken wasn't very soya saucey either.  All of it edible (clearly).  Overall, this place is decent and cheap cheap cheap, especially for Chinatown.  It could do better for variety I suppose.  There weren't many vegetarian options, but you veggies can eat somewhere else!  3.5 stars for now, but potential to increase to a 4 star on future visits."}
{"text":"Had a great BBQ time a year or two ago. Looks like it's been going downhill.  My recent experience? Paying $15 for half a roast duck ... you can do better."}
{"text":"Ah the Jug! This restaurant brings back a lot of memories during my University years, you can count on the Jug being open after those dreaded 11:00 pm exams to satisfy your late night hunger!   The restaurant itself is not very big and seating is limited, good luck trying to get a seat during lunch hours! (do not use their washrooms! you've been warned) But then again you probably want take-out because the seats are not at all comfortable and the decor is not very nice ... in fact somewhat unclean.   Their menu is pretty big and prices are extremely affordable with huge portion sizes. The food itself is mediocre at best but you will definitely leave with a full stomach. Personally I can only recommend their BBQ items since they do it quite well compared to many other establishments in the area.  This is probably a restaurant where you might want to come alone or with some friends for cheap eats; and not with your 'date' or for a family gathering."}
{"text":"I bought some bbq pork to try yesterday after reading the rave reviews.  The piece I got was mostly fat and hardly any meat.  I found it quite dry as well.  The sauce that was put on the pork was quite good but very little was put on a part of the meat.  I should have asked for some extra sauce.  It was okay.  Didn't blow me out of the water."}
{"text":"Small but great little Chinese food place in Chinatown.  I've only ever been there for take-out (the restaurant itself doesn't look like it's that nice a place to eat in) but I've always been really happy with the food.  And the prices are quite reasonable especially compared to some of the surrounding restaurants.  It's definitely one of the better deals in Chinatown.  I'd recommend calling in your order ahead of time so it's ready when you get there to pick it up.  The Spicy Squid & Shrimp dish is my favorite, it's got just the right blend of flavor and texture without being too spicy.  The fried rice and noodle dishes are also really good.  The only dish I would avoid is the So Gai chicken, as neither I nor any of my friends enjoyed it.  Overall a highly recommended place to get your Chinese food fixin' from!"}
{"text":"I would have rated this place a lot more, but since they've changed owners, its not the same.  The quality, and customer service has gone down.  Though this was not your fancy chinese restaurant, the food is still amazing, but not as good as it was before...  Though the decor needs a face lift this place has been around for years!! Their BBQ pork is one of the best, along with their General Tso CHICKEN, but this place needs help.....hope the food gods can help them redeem themselves."}
{"text":"The sign outside said Specials, walked inside and the place was filthy, the waiter was rude and filthy, table, floors and the kitchen were unbelievably worn out and, you guessed it, filthy.  How did this place get a health pass from the city?  Should have walked out then, but because of the reviews on here we gave it a chance.  Food was over salty and mediocre to say the least.  Seriously we just wanted to get out.  When the bill came it was triple the advertised price.  We said we were here for the special, waiter yells, \"No Special\".  The entire experience was nauseating to say the least.  With so many decent restaurants in the area do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  Wish we did."}
{"text":"I'm here a lot more than I care to admit. For $4.00 you can get a bowl of soup to start, huge portion of bbq pork on rice, orange slices and fortune cookies for dessert, and probably some leftovers for the next day.   A great (but probably really unhealthy) way to nom nom nom for under $5.   Notes:  Cash Only.  Always order BBQ pork on something (noodles, rice, etc)."}
{"text":"Continues to get more expensive, dirtier and definitely not the worlds best BBQ pork! At least they take debit now. If u like microwaved food, got for it!"}
{"text":"Dirty cheap food that's very tasty.  If you stay in, there's complimentary soup that's been simmering for hours--possibly days.  Amazing.  It's real tasty and I can get two meals out of the singapore vermicelli portion!"}
{"text":"i came here expecting at least a 3 star food since the ratings so high on here . but boooooo bbq pork sucked . maybe it was because we were there at 8pm or maybe because we know that theres a place nearby thats just as cheap, more dingy, but wayyyy better food . we've never seen bbq pork just sitting there all cut up in advance and ready to be served . servers were extremely sweet tho, it almost makes me feel bad giving them only 2 stars :("}
{"text":"Alas, the ownership has changed hands at one of two remaining old school BBQ institutions in chinatown (the other is Hong Fatt I believe).  Kom Jug Yuen has been around for at least 30+ years and is one of the oldest standing chinese BBQ places in chinatown.  Others have come and gone but Kom Jug a hole in the wall has survived through it all.  I guess after years of long hours (they are open until 6am apparently) the husband and wife needed a change.  Service was always better when the husband was there but when the wife was there (otherwise known as the tall lady with the red top).    While the husband was not overtly friendly he knew how to treat regular neighborhood customers.  He always gave extra freebies and made you feel valuable.  The wife on the other hand....  In our family we always referred to the wife as 'a tough customer' she was surly, unfriendly and often times downright curt to customers.  Whenever she was there you wouldn't even dare to ask for any extras.  Not only that, if she were to give you a roast pork feet, she'd cut off all the meat so you were basically given a soup bone.  The new owners aren't really friendly and while that isn't a stretch, the extras and quality have the potential to go down.  Luckily they retained all the original staff but sad to say once the staff go then the quality of the product will diminish and Kom Jug will fade into the darkness....  Anyone got a tissue?"}
{"text":"My husband has been OBSESSED with the \"BBQ pork rice-noodle soup\" at this place for years. He thinks the BBQ pork is some of the best you can get in Chinatown and the price for this soup (very filling) is super-duper cheap.  So why 3 stars?  We went there last night and the lady behind the counter was chewing and sucking on a piece of chicken (or duck?) and then immediately used those same hands to chop up some meat and collect it into a takeout container (thankfully not our takeout container). \"Gross-atating\" as we used to say in elementary school. Lady, you work in a restaurant, get it together!!"}
{"text":"Im so glad I was introduced to this place. It has character and great prices. Ok, yes.. so I really questioned a few times what exactly I was eating... but what did I expect for a gigantic 4$ plate of BBQ Pork?  By the way, I personally, I thought the pork was gross. If you love chewing on mostly just fat, by all means, order away. If you're like me and get so grossed out you have to spit it into a napkin once all the meat is gone, then stay away from this dish   I would suggest the spicy crispy beef instead. Its sooo tasty! The bok choy is cooked perfectly. Add a big plate of chicken fried rice to that and you can feed 3 people for 8 bucks each."}
{"text":"Have you feasted on Kom Jug? not Cum Jug, Kom Jug, you DIRTY DIRTY mind you.  This place has got to be thet cheapest Chinese food in town - it was first introduced to me by a friend of mine I'd like to refer to as 'king of cheap eats', and it is a place that holds a prominent place in my heart.  There portions are on the larger side of the scale (i tell ya, the fried dumplings were more like...fried sausages when it came to size) so it's a great idea to walk over there, if you're somewhat near downtown, otherwise, you WILL end up with doggie bag home. I walked there from Parkdale and still could not finish the meal: I walked back and I was still very much full until the next day.  There is no need to even open the menu - just glance around you - you will learn right away that the prices are ridiculously cheap. You'll also learn  what NOT to do on your wall when it comes to decor( I mean, I dunno where or when they found such...a wall paper). But I digress.  Another thing I enjoyed that took me by super surprise and I was somewhat \"eek\" about in the beginning - they prep their own ingredients. OUT IN THE DINING TABLE. This may throw you off; it certainly make me frown originally, but then I was glad to know that they buy the ingredients and prepare it themselves instead of buying frozen shit and dumping it in the food like some scuzy restaurants I know.  Think of this place as Tim Horton's of Chinese food (or the way it used to be); when you butt poor and all you got is change, bring it to Kom Jug and you'll be able to get you a good meal and eat till your mind explodes."}
{"text":"4 Stars when they are on, and 2 stars when they aren't.  The BBQ is 5 stars when its fresh, best in Chinatown by a mile. I have never had rice that was quite up to par though.  How do you mess up rice.  X number of scoops, rice, fill to line, push button. Rice ranges from sub-par to soggy and/or clumpy, and just plain crappy. This stuff is almost as bad as some crappy par-boiled crap rice -1 [or should it be -2].  Ask for lean meat? Why, do I ask for lean steak? No way, fat = flavour.  If there is a fatty but, you can just trim it, or just take a trip to flavour country.  I find it best to go early if i want some fresh stuff. Sauce is also top notch, its a sweet soy sauce type in look taste and viscosity.  It gets soaked up by the rice, which makes even the rice on the crappiest day edible.  $4 [BBQ Pork on rice] special is the only thing i have ever ordered.  Sometimes they give you a couple small veg pieces, and sometimes its just meat and rice.  Would I go back? Of course [if its around 12PM].    Would I prefer to bring my own rice?  Fa shizzle yo!"}
{"text":"Listen, you get what you kom for here. It's not great food or a beautiful dining hall but the service is good and the prices are way low.  Good for late night drunken food, not first dates :P"}
{"text":"Going to Chinatown is sometimes an adventure,  but there's the appeal of great food for cheap because it's a no-frills atmosphere. The tacky menus, the vinyl seating, the paper napkins and plastic tablecloths. Sometimes, the dingier the place is, the better the food is. This is not the case at Kom Jug Yuen.  I am cool with dodgy, but this place takes it to a whole new level. It's filthy, like, inexcusably filthy. This place is known for their BBQ pork, and I get that it's normal to have it sit in the front window as its been cured, but I don't think it would kill them to at least LOOK like they're cleaning the place where the pork sits. The plates were sitting on a shelf at the unholy mess that is the front counter and were old beaten up plastic plates that had water all over them (hopefully because they just got cleaned?). I found myself praying that the ground would swell up and the fires of hell would mercifully burn this building to the ground so something new and much cleaner could take its place. Ok, that might be a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much. Just a filthy dive of a 'restaurant'.  Pork was not bad. Food here (on previous visits) is not bad. I just can't sit here thinking of how freaking filthy this place is. Pass."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's cheap, authentic and tasty.   like the bbq pork on rice especially."}
{"text":"This Place is the place to be for Cheap Chinese food. Yeah, its cheap, but the food is good. Its a small place though, maybe thats one of the downsides.  Chicken fried rice for about 5 bucks, chicken balls for 6 bucks i believe, oh and duck w/ BBQ pork on white rice for 6 bucks as well. Me and my Friend were stuffed. I have nothing bad to say about this place, except for the fact that they don't accept debit, but oh well. Cant wait to go back and eat some good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Hot and sour soup from this place when you feel a cold starting is highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I HAD been eating at Kom Jug Yuen for over 20 years.  This was our weekly go to lundh place from work.  The owners and the waiters were always friendly and the food was great.  They often gave us free soup or a plate of some new dish to sample.  Then Ping sold the restaurant and it's been downhill ever since.  They used to have the best noodle soup in the city and their other dishes could be relied upon to be tasty and plentiful.  Now the food is not even mediocre - it's just not good, the portions have been reduced and the prices have gone up.  We have gone back on a few occasions in case they had improved but no such luck. What a shame that this great little restaurant has gone right downhill.  Won't be going back again."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst eating experiences in Toronto. I ordered the Roast Pork and Duck and the Steamed Chinese vegetables in oyster sauce.  What I got was microwaved roast pork and duck which was still cold and veggies which were well steamed but tasteless. They forgot the oyster sauce"}
{"text":"Can't beat the prices and portions! I'm here frequently for the $6 General Tso on rice. It's obviously not the fanciest place in Chinatown, but cant beat the prices."}
{"text":"This is a solid Chinatown greasy spoon.  It can be hit or miss - the pork can either be great or average depending on the day  I'll keep coming back as long as the prices stay this cheap!"}
{"text":"What a travesty!! After decades of being a reliable source for massive portions of cheap, tasty Chinese food and an amazing, hole-in-the-wall atmosphere, the reign of this Chinatown institution is over. About a year ago Ping sold Kom Jug Yuen. Apparently he was looking to slow down a bit as he gets older and rest a shoulder injury resulting from decades of chopping BBQ meat.  Since the sale, I've visited twice and both times were a disaster. The quality of the food has drastically decreased, the prices have been jacked up, and portions have become significantly smaller. Even worse, the atmosphere has been ruined. The new owners have none of Ping's friendliness or passion. Discounts and freebies for regulars are gone. The whole place seems soulless now. It's just another crappy Chinese restaurant.  If you loved Kom Jug Yuen in its heyday, please do yourself a favour and never return here. It will only cause heartbreak. If you've never been before, steer clear, there's plenty of better options in the area.  Fortunately, I happen to know that Ping is still out there serving up noodles and BBQ meat. If you happen to be at St. Lawrence Market, take a wander downstairs and you just might run into him. I'm pretty sure he'd love to see some of the old regulars from the Kom Jug days..."}
{"text":"I don't care about what anyone else says.  This is the best BBQ pork ($4.25) in all of toronto, and the seafood stir-fry noodles ($8.00) are delicious.  DO NOT GO INTO THE BATHROOM!!!!! (If you ever go and sit down to eat, get a place where you can look at the stairs that goes into the bathroom, and watch peoples faces as they come out...it's dinner and a show)"}
{"text":"There used to be a time (a long long time ago) when I used to go to Kom Jug and not think it too shabby. However, my last and most recent visit made me realize that some things don't change (like people's tastes do), but are certainly worth coming back to for nostalgia's sake.   My friends and I were mighty hungry when we arrived in the wee hours. No one working there seemed particularly happy to see us, so we stood at the door waiting for what seemed like ages before we were pointed in the direction of the only table available. That was the start of the notably bad service which wasn't always so in my experience.   The food although plenty filling, was only oookay. (What did I expect!?) The barbecue chicken had an extraordinary number of bones in it. The barbecue pork was heartier than most. The rice plates were enormous. The shanghai noodles were equally gigantic and slathered in sauce. The veggies seemed to have been reheated.   Despite how many times I've actually eaten at Kom Jug over the years, nary a handful of those times have I been sober. With their late hours, kitschy red lanterns, and scribbly neon posters, this greasy Chinese barbecue joint is in my opinion only fit for filling up at after one too many drinks."}
{"text":"While they never had the best BBQ pork in the city, it used to be decent but not any more.  Like almost every other authentic Chinese dish - it's better to drive to Markham, Richmond Hill or even Scarborough.  Downtown Chinatown is too hit and miss."}
{"text":"Cheap cheap cheap!  I was poorer than poor and wanted to afford a good decent meal. My last meal in Toronto. My friend, as a proud member of the Jewish community, knows all the cheap place!! *not racist! Factual!!*  :D So of course, we found this joint and had some amazing bbq pork. don't know the recipe, or how the magic is  done but LOVED it! Also ate some duck which was pretty decent, not the best duck of course, but 30$ for 2 peoples...sorry, two Big guys, is verryyy cheap! Lover the very quick service and very simple middle(not to say poor) man's meal!   Go there, you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"A (now-former) girlfriend first brought me to this place, giggling about the inevitable wordplay as she told stories about late night pork fried rice runs.   It's just the sort of place that a foodie should love:   Signage that may predate the English language.  Satisfying patina of grime on worn furniture.  Horrid wallpaper.  Rustically snarly staff.  Glorious racks of red lacquered meat hanging from the window in defiance of health codes the world over.   Handwritten bristol boards advertising specials that you can't order because you don't speak Chinese and \"white people don't like this\" (I think that Yelp would do its members a great service if someone started a menu translation thread).   And for those reasons, I award three stars.   Truthfully, I'd knock one or off for the food itself, for Kom Jug Yuen is a victim of the times, Cantonese food in a szechuan town, all prepared better, fresher, and much more artfully down the street and up in the wilds of Markham.   Hot and sour soup is rich, but sweet.   Fried mushrooms are tasty, but greasy and sweet.   Lo mein balances soft noodles and crispy veg, but it too is undermined by gloopy clear sauce.   Barbecue pork varies in texture between pencil eraser and pure fat or gristle. A few bites may indeed qualify for 'best in the city' status', but it's a lot to osrt through, especially when accompanied by pasty rice and a few tendrils of chinese greens.   Truthfully, I visit Kom Jug Yuen not to guzzle the food, but to enjoy the atmosphere, such as it is.   My, how far we've come."}
{"text":"Went back for the first time in a while and wondered why I didn't see that gruff old guy at the counter hacking pork and being all surly. (It didn't bother me at all, he was part of the appeal of this place to me.)  Then the food came and I realized something weird is going on here. The place is under new management and the food was terrible. Noodles were barely cooked and everything was drenched in salt. I got that weird thing you get sometimes at cheap Chinese buffets that load up the food with MSG and too much sauce where you break into a bit of a sweat and you feel dizzy afterwards.  Too bad. Same thing happened to one of my other favorites, San Francesco Foods, looks like the old people are cashing out their businesses as rents in downtown are getting just too steep to justify continued operation."}
{"text":"The glory of the Kom Jug has been bestowed on me.  Let it rain heavenly BBQ pork from the heavens down to the mountains of rice at my feet.  This place is CHEAP and the portions are HUGE!  For $7.75 I got the BBQ pork with veggies on fried noodles.  This dish could easily feed a family of four, hence I now have leftovers for the next two days.  If you want takeout you can get a turkey sized roasting pan full of BBQ pork for only $50.  Is it \"the best BBQ pork in North America\" as claimed, no, but I'd be willing to come back again as it is pretty good.  Don't forget to try the \"Monther's Day Special\" (yes I spelled that right) of two lobsters for $29.99."}
{"text":"Super cheap: the claim of Best BBQ pork in the city is no lie. Takeout is recommended as inside is a bit of a freakshow, and the decor can be described as \"early 1950's Macau commissary\"  but goddamn it, It's delicious."}
{"text":"While it isn't \"the best BBQ pork in N. America\", it's still pretty good. And very, VERY cheap - you can get half a pound of the pork for $6.50. Although the flavour does leave something to be desired (and they know it, too - they drench the BBQ pork in a soy-based sauce), it's still a good deal in terms of the amount of meat you get for the price. In addition, the people here are very nice and will give you lean BBQ pork if you ask for it, which is something not all Asian places will do.  In short, very good if you're looking for decent cheap eats, but nothing earth-shattering."}
{"text":"Delicious and unpretentious, as Cantonese cuisine should be. This is fairly authentic Cantonese cuisine (though much of the staff is mainland Chinese). It's on par with what you can get at a \"faan dim\" (rice place) in Hong Kong.  We enjoyed: - BBQ pork plate for $4. Some of the semi fatty pork bits were divine! - Beef pinapple fried rice. This fried rice was excellent! - Bok choi zai (baby bok choi) plate. These were cooked just right! - Preserved egg and pork congee. The pork in the congee is lower grade, and the congee itself is overly watery.  - Fish congee. - \"Lo hon zai\" (\"vegetarian\") fried noodles. These were a bit too oily and heavy on the oyster sauce!  If you don't want to swim in oil, be really specific with the waiter to order \"siu yao\" (less oil). Happily, they used less oil for most of our dishes!  Beware that the place is small-ish and fills up around 7pm!"}
{"text":"Sure, it's a claim scribbled in marker on neon poster board, but \"best BBQ pork in North America?\" This isn't even the best BBQ pork in the city, and I don't care how cheap it is.  Kom Jug (get your chuckles in, kids) is a weird, weird place. Every inch of wall is slathered in neon Bristol paper with the \"real\" menu readable only by those in the know. \"Round eyes\" order from their English menu which is overlong and confusing. There are a lot of duplicates like \"BBQ Pork\" and \"Barbecue pork\" and \"Pork BBQ\" and so forth. The atmosphere is depressing. On our visit we enjoyed the sight of a woman sleeping on a table while across from her another woman unshelled beans from a basket. (At least we know the ingredients are fresh!)  We successfully ordered some BBQ Pork, chicken, beef noodles and attempted to order water. Several attempts to procure the precious hydrogen hydroxide were met with no response. Not a shrug, nor a refusal or even the faintest twitch of acknowledgement. It was as though our server was literally deaf to the words \"can we get some water?\" We eventually got it, in the eponymous \"jug\" I had been anticipating.  It's true that you can't beat the prices and portion sizes, but you can beat the food. As I mentioned the BBQ is greatly overrated, and the chicken was flavourless and overcooked. I really enjoyed the beef and noodles, though. They tasted great and the beef was really tender. I would return, but probably only in the dead of night and under the spell of firewater.  Obligatory Title Pun: KOM together, right now!  Menu Readability: Bristol board. Neon.   Need to mention: This place is always open.   What this place teaches me about myself: Eating food for drunks while sober is certainly an eye-opening experience."}
{"text":"i walked past this place everyday for a year and never bothered looking inside. last week i had a craving for BBQ pork, saw the sign \"best BBQ pork...BBQ pork on rice $4\" and went in. from the outside this place looked rundown, grungy, and out of date. Shockingly, when i stepped inside the restaurant, it was PACKED at 5pm. every table was full and service was going full-tilt. i got take out and was quite happy with my meal. since then i have returned 2-3 times and have been happy with the food given the price point. solid noodles in soup with BBQ pork and veg. Cantonese chow mien was good too. warning: if you go after 8pm, it's likely all their roast meats and dumplings will be sold out.   service is speedy and comes with soup, tea and ends with orange slices, and a fortune cookie for luck.  seeing how popular New Ho King is right across the street, this might be Spadina's best kept secret?"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Went back for the dumplings. Now you only get 5 and it comes up to $6.50. I'm disappointing and after two days of consuming them, i still feel ill and so does my boyfriend. I am NEVER coming back."}
{"text":"My experience was a little less impressive than my tablemates'. My veggie entrée of deep fried tofu in black bean sauce was more expensive than a plate of BBQ pork ($8 vs $4) and while it was an enormous amount of food, I wasn't convinced.   Even though it was slated as 'vegetarian' I'm certain I tasted oyster sauce and the tofu was too squishy. The death knell was the rice: it was inadequately cooked and I kept biting into raw grains of rice. If a Chinese restaurant can't cook a damn bowl of rice, can I really trust anything else it brings out of the kitchen??"}
{"text":"This is a Chinese BBQ icon. No frills with great food, makes for good value.    While many items are very oily and saucy, this is the standard presentation for many open-late Spadina eateries, so the comparisons must be made in the neighbourhood to be fair.  Anything hanging in the window is great to eat, and often I go with any combination (or all) of BBQ duck, BBQ pork, BBQ chicken or roast pork over rice. A hearty and reasonably priced meal that's very filling, served with a soup.  For large groups they offer the usual Szechuan and Hunan fare, black bean beef, spicy chicken dishes, etc.  Though I no longer live in the area I make a point to come back and visit, whenever I'm craving the BBQ duck."}
