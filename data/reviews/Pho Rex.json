{"text":"I am never coming here again. Your service, food, and environment was all terrible. Not even worth a penny. Worse mistake of my life. Yuck. Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered rare beef pho but the beef came cooked well done. Imperial roll was weird and mushy/pasty? Also ordered three meals and they only sent us hot sauce for one and no cutlery. One plus was the broth for the pho - more flavourful than many other places."}
{"text":"If there's an option to give 0 star, i totally would. Here is a summary of our experience:   1. We waited for our two dishes for almost half an hour. The restaurant wasn't even busy, there were just 3 tables at that time and one was already served. We asked the waitress to check our orders and of course she came back and told us that \"it's coming\". Our food didn't come until 10 mins after..  2. The food was not tasty at all. We ordered one beef pho and one spicy beef noodle soup. The two dishes taste exactly the same except the spicy beef noodle is a little bit saltier.   Overall, this is the worst pho restaurant we've ever been in Toronto. We will not go back ever again and we highly don't recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Koreatown. Have been here numerous times. What the service lacks, the food more than makes up for. Definitely a hidden gem in Koreatown. The lemongrass chicken with white rice is to die for. Great value for money aswell. Would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"this is my kitchen. no, really. Not wanting to cook most night, I end up here for dinner most night and some lunches. Its $4.50 a bowl!  I only ever order one or 2 things, The #24 Pho and the chicken satay. The pho is one of the best I have ever had and is a ridiculously generous in portion. I get a kids size which fills me right up.   Service can get stretched if the rush hits hard, but these things happen and I don't let it bother me. I have seen them slammed, and empty, enough times to know they are generally good and food comes as fast as possible.  No cons from me."}
{"text":"Ordering: 5/5 My partner and I absolutely love ordering to this restaurant. They pick up the phone in a timely manner and picking up order is no hassle. We always order #47/#49 vermicelli and takes about 10 minutes walking distance to get there. The food is equivalent to the price you pay.  Most people seem to judge a restaurant based on the traffic or how it looks from the outside. This shouldn't be the case.  Customer Service: they are very nice people and please, keep it up!  Feedback, even though we shouldn't judge based on the traffic, I would suggest to make your entrance door more appealing by adding more lights and brighten up your dining area. It'll be more visible outside and it'll caught more attention to your restaurant.   If you live in the area as we do, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The worse green curry I've ever tasted! Its Watery!!! Wasnt satisfied at all. Though Tom yum soup was good and the Server is nice."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times due to my picky dining partner. My dining experiences had mixed results . The service can be slow at times. It was even more difficult to ask for a water refill. The food ranged  from burned/oily spring rolls to overly greasy noodles to flavourless non-creamy congee. However, the deep fried banana dessert was huge and extravagant with two huge scoops of ice cream on top.   One day, I had a craving for Thai fried rice so i ordered it around lunchtime. Once I got it home, I was shocked with the amount of rice in the box! There must have been two small scoops of rice. It didn't even fill up the box to the rim! For $9.00, this was a total ripoff!   That was the last straw with Pho Rex. If my dining partner wanted to go back, he can go in without me.  Note: you have to kinda exit the restaurant in order to go to the washrooms. There is a long and steep staircase to a scary washroom that's shared with the staff of another business upstairs. A second reason not to go there."}
{"text":"Love this place when I am feeling like a fast delicious meal for a cheap price. Their menu is huge! Some stuff  I would not recommend ordering like their generic \"pad thai\" etc. BUT the Pho is delicious and we also love ordering the sizzling lemongrass shrimp platter, and the fried green beans with garlic sauce!  Nothing fancy, but if you order the right stuff you will get it fast and you will feel like you hardly spent a cent!"}
{"text":"For the money, this place is great. However, some dishes are done better than others. That said, if you stick with the more common dishes you'll be please with the portions, quality and value. There's higher quality places around but for the money you can't wrong."}
{"text":"Being south Vietnamese, I'm very critical when it comes to good tasting Vietnamese food. Normally I try to avoid going to any fusion type Vietnamese restaurants but on a random night, I decided to check out Pho Rex since I was in the area. Ever since that night, I've always come back when I get the chance to.   Since I've been to Pho Rex on numerous occasions, I have tried quite a few dishes. There were some that I didn't like (certain fried noodles, I can't remember what dish it was) but there were others that have become a regular order (combos, dessert drinks, fried spring rolls and salad rolls)   The rating I'm giving Pho Rex is based on the following factors: excellent friendly service, the food comes out quick, very affordable prices, and the overall taste of the food (average to great). And even though there are some dishes I would never order again on the menu, the fact that this restaurant fulfil all of my other requirements, I'm giving this a 4/5!   If you're sceptical, just give the restaurant a try. I know for some, taste is everything (the food has to be dead on authentic) but you have to understand, authenticity comes at a high price most of the time. Pho Rex is a place = everyday affordable without compromising your taste buds. :)"}
{"text":"Tried the pho noodle, pad thai and congee. They were decent. Loved their pad thai. The noodle soup didn't had a richer taste than I expected."}
{"text":"Pho Rex is a very solid non-Korean offering in Korea town.    Pros: -great new interior -very friendly service -fresh food -extremely well priced for the quality   Usually get the pho or vermichelli and an app, and vietnamese coffee.  The food itself is not really better or worse than places like Ginger or Pho Hung (both pretty decent) but the price-to-portion size-to-service/atmoshere is a bit better.    Overall, very good place that does not disappoint"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and slightly hungry before our Monday night Dance Cave experience. Most of the places were closed at 10 PM, but Pho Rex was open, therefore we chose it.   We wanted something light to fill us, but also to leave strength to dance in the club after dinner. So we aimed for soup. Saw a big bowl another man was having and it made me think of the best Ginger soup ever, so asked for shrimp pho. This was priced reasonably. $3.50 + tax, but instead of big bowl it was for kids size pho (which is their small).  It took long to get those small bowls of soup to us, as there were only 4 other people besides us, but when the soup came with 6 shrimp balls I forgot that, as the soup was very tasty, hot and filling. Girl serving us was very shy and seemed bored.  Anyway we left the place happy and full and enjoyed our dance after Pho Rex.  Go there when you do not expect much and want a good bite....of soup."}
{"text":"Ordered a beef pho and pad thai for my gf, we both went home with diarrhea :("}
{"text":"Don't do it. It was late, we needed food, there weren't many Vietnamese options still open at 10:30pm. We should've just gone for pizza. The food was bland, the vermicelli bun came with no fish sauce, indeed no sauce at all. The chicken satay was dry, also without sauce. Wholly unsatisfying meal. We tossed most of it out."}
{"text":"Broth was cold. Lots of food for the price. Gluten free options. But pho was just ok."}
{"text":"Do not order the pad thai here!  You have been warned!  Any place that can't make up its mind on the menu they're bound to make mistakes.    The menu is full of Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Korean items similar to Noodle Bowl restaurant near Spadina & Bloor.    I ordered the pad thai combo, it came with mango salad, hot & sour soup and a spring roll.  1. spring roll was way too deep fried  2. pad thai was way too sweet and looked like the colour of sweet & sour sauce  My friend ordered the mango walnut chicken - the mango pieces were way too big and required cutting.   A note to myself: Stick to thai restaurants if I want thai food.  Service: attentive and very smiley Decor: spacious & clean Note: Washroom is located up a flight of stairs."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a late dinner, after 8:30pm. There were a few more tables in there with people eating. We ordered the Tamarind Shrimp and Basil Chicken. Both dishes arrived quickly. They were both delicious. The Basil Chicken tasted more like Pepper/ Basil Chicken, but none the less it was pretty good. The Tamarind Shrimp was really nice and tangy. I will definitely come here again to try more dishes.  Place was clean enough (the table cloth was stained), food was good and prices were cheap."}
{"text":"I went there at 7pm, I and my friends planed to go pho noodles  shop in Chinatown. The noodles and the soup was the worst I have tried. Service is not that good as said in reviews seems they short of servers there. We would not go there again."}
{"text":"Very good and friendly service. The prices are reasonable and I enjoy all of the food I have ate there. I especially like how attentive and friendly the waitresses are."}
{"text":"This place was much better than expected. It's hard to get non-Korean food in Korea Town. Which I GUESS makes sense.  So the decor leaves a lot to be desired, but it's inexpensive, the staff are friendly, and it's quick!  I had the pad thai lunch special - $9.95 - came with tom yum soup, spring roll, mango salad, and chicken pad thai. It was delish.  The Good: 1. Inexpensive. 2. Friendly. 3. Fast.  The Bad: 1. Decor.  Recommended for a quick lunch"}
{"text":"Maybe I should have ordered the pho as the name suggests this is \"their dish\".  Instead, I opted for the lunch special.  Here's what I was served: Neon - I've never seen anything this neon and I've been to Ibiza - fluorescent orange pad thai.  Pad thai is allowed to be a bit greasy, I understand, but this was congealed grease that rendered it inedible.  Overcooked, tasteless, neon sludge.  The teacup bowl of mango salad was fine and, therefore, my \"favourite part\".  Also, the restaurant was grubby.        An aside: my coworker and I could barely choke down our miniature cups of super spicy Tom Yum.  We asked for water, maybe...what felt nine times before it arrived."}
{"text":"The waitress that served us was very welcoming and my girlfriend and I ordered a combo each for $11.50 which included a mango salad, a main and a spicy soup. This was too much food for us as the mains are a big serving.   My main was a chicken pad Thai and my girlfriend got a green curry. Having personally travelled to both Thailand and Vietnam I found the food an authentic mix of both countries. I thoroughly enjoyed my pad Thai.   Those with a low tolerance for spicy foods should beware of the green curry though as it is very hot."}
{"text":"This was a decidedly underwhelming lunch experience: service was REALLY slow and inattentive, the dish they brought me was missing literally half of its primary ingredients (no, really), and the food was only so-so.    I would never come here again with so many amazing options nearby."}
{"text":"Pho Rex makes tasty pork filled spring rolls fried up with a side sauce.  I also ordered the pho with beef balls and 'flank'.  Overall the soup is acceptable, but the beef balls were quite firm (they weren't raw) and the some beef flank pieces were chewy.  The large soup will cost you $6.95, but you would be better off with getting a small, and just loading up on the greasy but tasty spring rolls for lunch."}
{"text":"The waitress who greeted me was very friendly and smiley. She remained attentive throughout the whole meal.  Ordered the Pad Thai dinner combo which was a pretty good price at $11.50. I hadn't had pad thai in a while and thought I'd give it a try despite this being a Pho place.  The mango salad, tom yum soup and spring roll came first really fast. The size may be small to some people but for me it was perfect just to get a little taste of everything and not get full before the entree arrived. Soup was spicy and flavorful with fresh mushrooms thrown in. I really enjoyed that. Mango salad was refreshing but nothing special to write home about. Spring roll was my least favourite. I didn't like the pork filling that much.  Pad thai was average. Saucy and on the sweet side if you like your pad thais sweet. Came with a side of raw sprouts. Chicken was kind of dry but the tofu in the noodles I really liked!"}
{"text":"Ordered the rare beef pho, strawberry shake and beef with rice and egg. Instead I got a mango shake, and the pho came with wilted basil, small noodles, and meh broth. It was edible, but not much more than that. I won't go hungry,  but I won't order again! Not worth the money. .."}
{"text":"Since moved to Toronto, I tried many restaurant and had good and bad experience. This was way beyond horrible... I wish I can wipe out my memory and buy dinner from Subway... Padthai was water down ketchup with melting noodle... Green curry was smell like dirty water after wiping floor... Now I am on the bed with wish not to have sick tonight..."}
{"text":"Located in Koreatown and surprisingly the pho here is pretty decent. I like how they offer the kid's size pho, which is perfect for me. They actually give you a lot of noodles for a kid's size and they don't cheap out on meatballs either like other places would.  The vegetarian springs are actually good too."}
{"text":"I ordered a seafood pho (no 36 ) on the menu and it was 8.95. The broth didn't taste flavorful, few shrimps, 2 mussels, 2 piece of cuttle fish and few imitation crab sticks. Vietnamese Pho's essential is the broth. When I had the first sip of their broth, I was very disapointed. I might be just unlucky to ordered one of their worst dishes."}
{"text":"I love to eat Pho, this place is nothing to get crazy about. The broth was not flavourful it tasted more like msg, the noodles where broken :(, I was in a rush and this was the closest place. I dont think i will go back. It is ok if u don't have any other options."}
{"text":"Fairly nice pho place - we were surprised to find it in the middle of Koreatown though! We took a long (like 30 minutes) to think of what to order, but the waitress was very accommodating and tried giving us suggestions too.  The waitress didn't really speak English that well, but understood that I didn't want any greens on top of my pho!  Food came relatively quickly, around 10-15 minutes.  My friend's gyozas looked pretty tasty! Their lime, bean sprounts, and mint leaves came on a separate dish, which was a nice touch so that you could put in however much you wanted.  I ordered a kid's size chicken pho, which I was barely able to finish for a lunch.  Be careful - that kid's size is deceiving: it is pretty big and definitely enough for a lunch, but with relatively little chicken! In our table, we ordered a beef pho and another spicy soup that was a medium, although, she seemed to have the same amount of beef/noodles as us, just more soup! The kid's size was about $5 -6, so definitely a good deal!  All in all, a nice pho place with solid food for what you pay!"}
{"text":"Pho Rex is an excellent alternative to the Korean and Sushi restaurants that occupy the Koreatown and Annex area. I was a regular at this place back when I lived in the Annex.  I was in the area the other day and decided to stop by for some pho. The staff is still as friendly, and the food is still delicious. The pho, in my opinion, is the best in the neighbourhood. And If you're not in the mood for some Vietnamese cuisine, the Chow Mein noodles and Flat noodle dishes are also good.  The pricing at Pho Rex is very reasonable. $3.95 for kids size pho (which is their small) - you can't really beat that! They give good portions for what you pay.   If you're in the area and you want something different, Pho Rex is a great place to try."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a couple of times. The food is good for the price. They serve more than Pho, many options to choose from including some Thai dishes. Not the best/most authentic Vietnamese food I've had, but likely the only option in Koreatown.   Tip: They are closed on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I am noodle folk - I love noodle fan and I ALWAYS have room in my tummy  for noodles. While I  love Korean food - there are times that I crave for something else then Korean noodles (rare but it does happen) - I tend to crave Pho in the evening after work - or after yoga except the only Pho place around was in Chinatown or somewhere else outside of walking distance; when this place opened I was beside myself with joy.  I've been here a few times now - and I can say that although it's got sight Korean twist(maybe cuz it's in Korean town?) such as using different types of meat - it's as delicious as it can be. I had excellent service and always left satisfied. The various sizes of available caters to various states of hunger I may feel - \"Kid's size \"for when I can nibble, small size for when I can eat something, and medium for when I'm starved. I dare not try eating the large by myself, but I imagine that would be a great size to share with a friend.   It seems to always be bustling with people - yet there is always a seat available for two, which is awesome. The only down side would be that the washrooms are upstairs. Otherwise it's a must try - it's no Pho Hang but, it's still great."}
{"text":"This place is really great! I've tried their fried rice, congee and pho and all were amazing!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend got the worst food poisoning I've ever witnessed from the Pho here. He was out for two full days, non-stop vomiting for almost 8 hours. So yeah... there's that."}
{"text":"After all the junk I've been eating lately, plus the summer heat, I just knew what I was craving.. Vietnamese vermicelli!!  However, I was slightly taken aback by the chicken + spring roll vermicelli I ordered. Being accustomed to having my vermicelli's bowl cool and filled with veggies, I was definitely disappointed when met with the opposite. Still, the tender chicken and crispy spring roll did make up for it.  Probs gonna come back to try their Pho and make a better assessment of this place."}
{"text":"All the stir fry and rice dishes I order here r Delish! Calamari  and the appetizers too. Fresh shakes. The pho soup not so much. It's pretty cheap price wise. Would reccomend  for all food except pho which is funny bc of their name. Maybe just change name lol. The lunchtime pad Thai special is amazing. Brought lots of friends here and dates and it's always been great."}
{"text":"When in Koreatown go for a Korean restaurant. Service wasn't good, i had to get my own menu, pork chop was microwaved based on the high temperature, the accompanied sauce had a chlorine taste. Overall not a great experience."}
{"text":"Their pho was just meh. The soup which for me is the most important part of pho was just editable.. Not rich, not tasty, not good. We also ordered their Phoenix Roll which was \"tiger shirmp\" wrapped with same beef we had in our pho (do not recommend). The beef was sliced too thick so when it soaked in the hot soup for too long it became well done, hard to eat, no flavour tbh. The only good thing about the restaurant was their fresh fruit drinks for $2.95! I got the jackfruit drink since I don't normally eat tropical fruits at home. It was delicious! The waiter did tell me they use frozen jackfruits which was still very fresh. We ordered these 4 things, with tips in total came to $30 for 2 people.   Wouldn't come back again for food but if I pass by I might come get their jackfruit drink that was worth."}
{"text":"Definitely a surprise.  A Thai/Vietnamese resto in Koreatown? ok  We mostly went in because it's next to Hoda Kwaja and we didn't want to walk much further west as the concert we were going to later was north on Bathurst (best concert of the the year btw - Ensemble Polaris' Not the Nutcracker).  We both ordered the combo special - mini salad/mini soup/main/spring roll - $11.50 total.   The salad was the Thai standard but the dressing was a bit peppier than usual which I really appreciated.   My friend had the Tom Yum soup - just enough and maybe a bit too spicy for her.   I can't do shrimp so they subbed a really nice chicken broth/mushroom soup for me - really clean and tasty tasting.      Chicken Pad Thai was our main.   Too much for me to finish, so the lad upstairs is snacking on it now.  Oddly (?) the main thing leftover was chicken.  How often does that happen - too much meat in a combo dish?  Well, it happened tonight.     The star of the meal was probably the crispy pork spring roll.  It was a total surprise.  Truly delicious and crispy - not one of those wobbly wonders you get in so many places - they didn't come out of a freezer box for sure.  Fast and super-friendly service on an early Saturday evening.   Everything was clean - and the complimentary tea was flowing once they figured out we needed the first refill.  Random washroom location - sort of out the front door and upstairs - shared with an accounting office.  Not the standard Toronto trip/slide into the basement.     We will definitely be back.   ohhhhhhhhh side note ... a real good point from my perspective - not too salty.  I didn't need to sneak a gallon of water into the concert afterward as so often happens after Spadina/Annex/Danforth meals."}
{"text":"Why isn't there a zero star option. The noodles were over cooked, the spring rolls taste like garbage and above all, the shrimp was literally rotten.  I added a photo of the rotten shrimp, hopefully it doesn't get taken down."}
{"text":"Cheap and good enough. If you like cheap and good enough then totally! Nothing amazing but very affordable. It's pretty good but the low price is the main reason to come here."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had spring rolls, summer rolls, fried shrimp wontons and rice with egg and pork chop. Big portions. We also had avocado shakes which were delicious! Just like how my mom makes them. The server was very nice and accommodating. Only concern is that the restaurant wasn't heated well when nt boyfriend and I went. There was an extreme cold warning, so that didn't help either. Will come back."}
{"text":"I love this place for Pho because it's near my house. As a vietnamese person, we generally are very aware of what taste good and what doesn't. I find that the pho here is pretty good, not the best of course, but hits the tummy. I usually get a medium sized bowl, spring rolls, and fried banana for desert. Firstly, I absolutely am in LOVE with their spring rolls, it's really crispy with chicken and bits of veggies. The sauce that it comes with pairs nicely together. The deep fried banana with icecream is honestly one of my all time favourite deserts, it's just so delicious- the blend of crunch, sweet, and cold cream :) I recommend going here if you want to eat something yummy."}
{"text":"Pho Rex is pretty mediocre. Really 2.5 star but I will round up.  It's a \"Viet-Thai\" place located smack in the middle of Korea Town. I was so sick of Korean food one night that we tried this place instead.  Pho Rex is twice as big as any other restaurant in the area. As a result, it always looks empty, even if there are 4-5 tables of patrons. It has been refurbished inside and the decor is pleasant and clean. You can see the cook at work as there is an open kitchen space at the back.  The menu is entirely predictable. Pho, bun (vermecelli) and rice dishes as well as pad thai, green curry, mango salad and your other usual \"Viet-Thai\" menu items.  I tried the wonton soup. Lots of MSG in that bad boy. I must have drank 2 liters of water after I got home. The soup was decent but nothing noteworthy. My friend had a bun bo dish which is the standard vermecelli, bit of salad stuff, topped with stir fried beef and a spring roll.   Meals are generally under $10 dollars. Servers are VERY friendly (big smiles) but they seem to move slowly. Food took awhile despite the place being fairly quiet.  Overall, not terrible, but not very special."}
{"text":"One of the rare Vietnamese pho in the area. Average, not more.... Several menu items are really poorly executed including shakes. Spoons are washed with bleach and as they are in plastic they taste like bleach!"}
{"text":"Liked the other Yelp reviews and ended up at Pho Rex today.  Good, but although their vegetarian pho (6.95) with one spring roll was okay/good, it wasn't as satisfying as the other dry vegetarian pho that I enjoyed at Pho Hung in Chinatown recently.    Service was definitely good.  Interior was nicely decorately, and AC'd.  They definitely have more than just Vietnamese fare here; their two daily specials today featured mainly 4-5 typical Thai dishes.  Lunch combos are 9.99, dinner combos are 12.99.    I'm willing to go again I'm curious about a few other dishes, but I know that  their Asian-fusion style means any dish that I order won't be authentic.  Still, it IS good to have more than just the options of Korean, Ethiopian and Indian around here."}
{"text":"Yikes this place isn't that great. You are better off buying food in the frozen department of a grocery store. They cut corners on all the sauces etc. They try to do too many things and don't manage to get any of them right. I ordered a spicy beef soup which didn't have any vegetables or the right noodles that it is traditionally served with. My friend ordered pad Thai and tasted like store bought sauce with undercooked noodles. There are better places to visit in the neighbourhood."}
