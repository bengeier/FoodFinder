{"text":"Pizza was graded a B. Wings were D- as they were over cooked and tough in the middle around the bone"}
{"text":"An old staple of my old stomping grounds.  The white cheese pizza here is the most popular among my friends.  This place has just been here so long that I dont think that even if they served awful pizza to you, it wouldnt make a difference.  I am not saying they ever have but this place...like I said is a staple.  The crust is burned most of the time so it is crunchy and the actual pie isnt that thick so if thats your bag, this place will be good for you.  Honestly though, you have to try the white cheese pizza..."}
{"text":"This place use to be pretty good several years ago.  Gave it another chance the other day.  First off, flies and restaurants don't go together.  I guess none of the staff noticed them.  The marinara sauce has absolutely no taste.  Like someone squished a tomato in their hand and threw it in some hot water.  The little baked dough twists use to come out hot and fresh.  Last couple times they felt like old ones thrown in a microwave.  The tortellini was severely over cooked.  Pesto cream sauce? sorry this is just a way to cut corners.  If you cant afford to make straight up pesto leave it off the menu!  Putting a tablespoon of sad pesto into a nasty cream sauce don't get it.  My advice, get a new chef, one that can put some passion into his food."}
{"text":"Love Zeppes. Huge menu, friendly service great food. This place is always crowded but worth it if you have to wait. Very reasonable prices and they deliver. Recommend pasta with Old World sauce and house dressing on your salad."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the ultimate dining experience, make this your go to spot! Whether you are looking to wine and dine with friends, stop in for a quick bite on your lunch break, or host a private shin-dig outdoors on the amazing outdoor patio, Zeppe's will make sure that you and your guests have an A+ experience and be sure to treat you like family!  The food is fresh, hot, and absolutely delicious!! My personal favorites is the stuffed shells carbonara and the lobster ravioli! OH, and the Clevelander is a MUST have--best pizza ever!!!  The staff is so friendly and accommodating and the environment is clean and inviting. The place really speaks for itself. I haven't been an ongoing customer for close to a decade now for no reason;)"}
{"text":"Spent the evening at zeppes tonight. Lisa and stephanie were awesome. I think no matter what you order you will be pleased.  Give them a try  U might wait a minute for a table but thats just a good sign."}
{"text":"Zeppe's is a good pizzeria in a town full of pizzeria's. I haven't been inside the store in a couple of years, but I recently had their pizza at an event. It is very good pizza. I went ahead and had pepperoni and enjoyed it. There was the perfect amount of pepperoni; not too much but not too little. The crust is unique to other pizza places. It's crisp but a little chewy at the same time. It doesn't look like your average pizza crust. I've never had their salads or pastas before. There is a dining area inside, but again, I haven't been inside in a couple of years and have never eaten in. Overall, Zeppe's is a good pizzeria, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by great service snd excellent food. Have eaten here many times.  Never disappointed.   Dining here bouna petite"}
{"text":"When you go here don't have super high expecting and you'll be fine.  The pizza is a bit doughy and the salads are basically cheese and iceberg lettuce. But everything tastes average to above average.  The atmosphere is nice and casual and great place for kids. Sit, eat, enjoy a glass of wine and take it for what it is."}
{"text":"It's hard to put into words how perfect of an experience we had at Zeppe's last Friday for our wedding. Firstly, we gave Zeppe's a very short notice to plan our big event (3 weeks). Without hesitation, Chris, Zeppe's event planner, dove in, reserved the entire restaurant for us, and began planning the decorations and food menu. She had everything put together for us within 2 weeks --from the menu, to linens, to decorations, to a schedule of the night's events. Now for the night of the wedding itself--the restaurant was set up perfectly to host a wedding. The tables were moved out of the middle dining room, which was where we had the ceremony and would later be used as the dance floor. The decorations were absolutely gorgeous--flowers, linens, centerpieces, a hand decorated trellis, and candles. The food was absolutely delicious--we crafted our own menu and were given a large variety of options to pick from. We also had an open bar, which worked out perfectly.  Also, the price was unbeatable for a 60 person wedding. Zeppe's was extremely reasonable and tailored the menu to match our budget.  The staff was very helpful and efficient. All of our guests had a blast and we had the time of our lives. Chris and Zeppe's management staff and wait staff really pulled this off! We cannot thank them all enough. This is a truly special group of people. Thank you again for making our perfect day just that--perfect!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Hudson, IMO. The new remodel is very nice. Good pastas too"}
{"text":"I love coming here. Decorated with an Italian feel, it'[s very nice inside. Their Old World Greek linguine is amazing as well as the Californian Pizza. It's a bit pricey, but the portions are huge so you can basically get two meals for the price. The waitresses are very friendly and usually prompt. If you're craving Italian, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We really like Zeppe's.  The food is good, the staff is friendly, and the price is reasonable.    We were a bit disappointed this evening, because we ordered an appetizer, which came about two minutes after our salad and two minutes before our entreees.  Our server told us that  the appetizer would be delayed -- so why don't they delay the entree if the appetizer comes late?  Maybe so they can seat more people I guess.  We were overwhelmed with a lot of food at the same time.    We wound up bringing a lot of our food home. But it was all very good! Employees kept coming by and asking to take our plates and we got the dstinct impression they wanted us to leave. I guess we took too long to eat the salad, appetiizer, and entree that were all delivered within a few minutes of each other."}
{"text":"Horrible, I will never order again!  Salads and dressings were incorrect.  Shrimp Aglio was so dry and had no flavor very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Would be worth returning if the customers were allowed to get food on their own, the experience is ruined by surly waitresses that really don't seem to enjoy being bothered with customers."}
{"text":"I had the chicken parm.  The chicken had a crispy exterior with a moist flavorful center.  The sauce was warm, hearty, and had a hint of sweetness.  My husband had a calzone, which had an amazing buttery, flaky, and delicious crust."}
{"text":"This is a good go to place when we can't all agree where to go.  I've had several good meals here.  But I have to say I really wish they would step it up on the homemade chips.  They have been stale every single time.  And that's disappointing.  We like their thin crust pizza, subs, eggplant parmesan and meatball Italiano bake.  Please, the chips have potential, please make them fresh!  Bonus points if they come to the table still warm."}
{"text":"I've been going to Zeppe's for 10+ years. The food is your average Italian food. Not bad but nothing to write home about. They make a good martini, so I highly recommend them on the happy hour nights for martinis. The calzones are also very good ... probably my favorite thing on the menu (also huge, so plan to take 1/2 of it home when you order). If you're looking for some Italia  that won't disappoint, then Zeppe's is your place."}
{"text":"I have heard such great things about this place - and it's been in business for a very long time.  We went there with a party of 8 people on Memorial Day.  The service was very good - we had 2 servers that really were responsive to our needs which was great.  My sister and I ordered the veal parmesan - hard to find on menus anymore so of course I had to order it.    unfortunately, both of us had to send it back b.c. the veal was rubbery and seemed overcooked and very chewy.  Not good at all.  Our server sent it back and we replaced it with the chicken parmesan - much better.  The sauce was a bit tart for my taste as well.  The house dressing - very good."}
{"text":"We were excited to check this place out, especially since we host an Italian dinner every month.  Sadly, after our appetizer, things went downhill.  The food was just average.  I didn't enjoy their sauce on my pizza.  Our service was very non-existent and they weren't even remotely busy.    It's okay, but not anything I will rush back for."}
{"text":"We had the spinach ravioli and bruschetta pasta. Both were really well made and tasty. Ambience and service is good. Place feels more local and personal than eating at an olive garden"}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere for kids couples families whatever... now its not the best pizza in town if you're in Hudson you can go 10 to 20 minutes away and find exceptional pizza but this is a good place to go if you have picky eaters"}
{"text":"Really good food, great selection but rather slow service.  The stuffed crust pizza and calzones are awesome."}
{"text":"Our family loves Zeppies in Hudson. Love the food and service. Our favorite the veal parm."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I wasn't very excited when my family decided we'd go to Zeppes for dinner... Im already not a fan of Italian food, and I've never been a fan of Zeppes pizza. They seemed fairly busy when we got there, but we had called ahead, so we sat right down. My family ordered both a pepperoni and sausage pizza, and a mashed potato pizza as well as salads. I opted for the Zeppes antipasto and half a pound of garlic wings. After waiting a little while, our salads came out. My antipasto was pretty good, but it wasn't the best antipasto I've had. I wasn't a big fan of they're pepperoni. If you're wondering what salad dressing to get, go with the Italian. It's pretty good, and from what I've heard, they make it in house. The wings were pretty good for an Italian restaurant. Not as good as Quaker steak, but better than what you would expect. I did really liked the garlic sauce though. When the rest of my family was done eating, I tried a leftover piece of mashed potato pizza, which was good, but missing a component. It tasted like a potato skin that desperately needed a sharp cheese and some sour cream. Overall, zeppes isn't a bad place. I'm not sure I'd go there if the choice was mine alone, but I won't shiver in fear quite as much next time my family suggest it on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised by Zeppe's. I was expecting your typical chain pizza place but they actually have an extensive menu. They remodeled last year and have a nice enclosed patio."}
{"text":"I was there on 8/22. If the owner/manager lady could quit getting drunk on house wine long enough to serve us it might have been better. Waited way to long. The atmosphere was tense and unfriendly. Food came out late, it was barely warm and just ok. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! You are treated like family when you arrive and the pizza is amazing!! The patio is great in the summer for relaxing with friends and perfect for parties!"}
{"text":"Lovely Italian restaurant. Fresh pasta, great sauces, delicious garlic rolls, and the pizza is the best!"}
{"text":"Katie, the bartender makes a mean Aqua Velva. She gave me an old fashioned as well. Great service. Also lovely singing voice, something like Etta James and Jesúchristo. Definitely coming back soon"}
{"text":"Something's changed here: Ordered the Thin Crust Thursday Daily Special last night (3 September) with mushroom and hot Italian sausage for delivery.  Pizza arrived 45 minutes later (on schedule) with a $2.50 delivery charge, plus a tip = now my $10 pizza was $15.  Anyhow, the mushrooms were canned (that's a first for this establishment), the sausage scarce, the crust soggy and not at all thin, the sauce acidic, with very, very little cheese.  We have been fans of Zeppe's here in Hudson for years, but this was a HUGE disappointment.  Now we'll be searching for a new pizza near home or making the trip to Luigi's every time we need a 'pizza' fix."}
{"text":"Update: $50 of food delivered and it was pretty tasteless. Understood that it was cold as weather out precludes hot delivery, but it was disappointing.  Bland.  Lovely little slice of Italy in Hudson - busy on a Tuesday night with lots of families enjoying the quaint atmosphere and food. Nice staff who work hard and deliver good service. Large menu made it hard to choose - I was tempted by the Italian nachos! Pizza looked good on other tables but I got the special pasta."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Zeppe's! Delicious food and fantastic, friendly service! Pizza is delicious, and the salmon is fresh and healthy! Garlic knots are my real guilty pleasure though. Wish I could get there more often!"}
{"text":"We ordered Zeppes last weekend and it was pretty enjoyable. We got a white pizza with extra garlic, which was really good -- nice sauce, nice balance of cheese to crust, and actually good edible crust. I also ordered the Chicken, Bacon and Ranch wrap with the fresh chips, which was more mediocre. It was just iceburg lettuce with bacon, ranch and chicken. It tasted good, but there was nothing to make it special. My fresh chips were burned and greasy, so somebody needs to work on their fryer skills. Boyfriend also ordered a calzone and was pleased with it, but again, nothing special. The unfortunate thing about this place is that everything was pretty pricey. If it weren't, I would have started ordering from here a bit more regularly, but it just isn't worth it for the price they charge, unfortunately. Don't get me wrong -- I will likely order another yummy pizza from them, but they're going to be more of a special occasion kind of pizza place than a place we go to regularly."}
{"text":"Ordering for my first time on super bowl Sunday!! Heavy ordering night. Just called in and had great polite help on the phone. I am writing this review before I get my food but I am excited for it after the service on the phone. Cross your fingers that the food is as good as the service. And oh yah... I used the $5 coupon from Yelp!"}
{"text":"Dining area is alittle too intimate, lots of variety on all menus.  Service was so good that multiple staff waited on us.  Everything was fine, food was satisfying.  Will return eventually, a good once a quarter experience.  Our friends are always good company, which is a plus no matter where we are dining, or what we are having."}
{"text":"After a friend told us that the food is good we decided to stop in for lunch. We were greeted at the door and seated promptly, we were shocked that we were the only ones in there for lunch, while reading the menu we noticed the the table was sticky and still had bits of food on it, the floors looked like they haven't been swept in a while and there was food all over the window sills. After ten minutes from being seated the waitress finally decided to great us. I have to say looking around and the waitress being as unfriendly as possible are hope's were declining by the minute.   We ordered the provolone wedges, a salmon ceaser salad and the meatball, pepperoni and parmesan pizza. To our surprise the food was pretty good. The marinara was tasty, the pizza was crispy and the salmon was cooked perfectly. Even though the food was good we prefer not to sit and eat in a dirty establishment and have horrible service."}
{"text":"Mary had angel hair pasta.  I had ACE fish. The fish wasn't very good as it wasn't completely done,  but Mary says that the pasta was excellent."}
{"text":"Had some dinner here this evening, ordered  the calamari, side salad and meatball pepperoni calzone. Salad was very good and ice cold. Calamari was perfectly cooked and tender with light breading. The calzone was so large I had to take half of it home.  The service was fast and top notch.  Ambiance was warm and inviting.  There is also a small bar with a cozy seating arrangement.  I recommend you give this place a try as there are many items on the menu, and not just Italian fare."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place for dinner.  However, when I go here for lunch I have to adjust my expectations.  I drink wine with my meals and have gotten several musty/old glasses of wine here.  The staff does not keep track of how long the wine bottles are open - they just glug them right into your glass.  I have had dried bits of cork in my glass, strings of sediment, and undrinkable glasses.  It is up to the customer to ask the server for a glass from a new bottle.  My tastebuds are generally frazzled by this time so I just ask for \"something that hasn't been opened yet\".  This totally derails the experience of a new-found wine.  The food is good - the menu is SO varied that Zeppes doesn't seem to specialize in any one type of cuisine - even though one would expect down-home Italian family recipes.  The waitstaff is like a family - which is sometimes a good thing - sometimes not.  On my last visit at lunch, my waitress had her pre-teen daughter helping her.  The mini-waitress did a great job, however when I commended her, I got a sob-story from her mother.  The daughter was working so she could afford a field trip for school.  I literally sat through a half-hour long diatribe of how the father had abandoned her and she was trying to raise $xx.xx to go on some field trip.  I have always been a generous tipper, especially with this particular waitress.  Why do I need to listen to this while I'm relaxing at lunch?  And why didn't this waitress apply some of my previous 40% tips to her daughter's educational enrichment?  Beyond that, the atmosphere is romantic, the service is personal, the pizza and calzones are amazing!  The beer selection is lacking, the wine list appears to be better than it is because of freshness issues, and the salads/Italian dressing/garlic rolls are outstanding!    The desserts appear to be store-bought rather than homemade (although they are good).  The Limoncello is a sweet knock-off of the strong, lovely treat that many Italians keep in the freezer to serve at home.  Sadly I bragged about Limoncello to my newbie husband.  We should have purchased a bottle at the liquor store."}
{"text":"Very yummy. Always in the hunt for some good Italian food and Zeppe's hit the spot. Definitely recommend it if you want a quick and easy dinner out."}
{"text":"We were staying nearby and saw this zigzag crust pizza which looked delicious. However, what we got was a regular looking pizza that was just sub par. The nations delivery chains have a better pizza. We also got the garlic twists and cinnamon twists. Those were a waste of money. They are the same bread twist only one has a tiny bit of garlic (I'm being generous saying it had any at all) and the other is semi coated with cinnamon sugar mix and they give you a packet of icing. Maybe it was just this location but I'd take your money elsewhere. Gave them 2 stars cause it's still pizza."}
{"text":"This is our go to cozy spot. The food is always good and they have great customer service. The restaurant is clean and I like the lighting concept."}
{"text":"I love Zeppes take out or dine in! I love the buffalo chicken pizza. My family loves the zepperonni roles. Huge menu with something for everyone. I always want Zeppes when I am in Hudson."}
{"text":"$80 for three XL pizzas and 3 dozen wings.  very good"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Hudson!  Pepperoni and meatball are the best toppings. The pasta is good too, big enough to split, but the bread sticks/twists are bland and soggy."}
{"text":"They have good pizza but, most of Thier food with exception to the pasta and salad, is pre-prepared ! Service is good.  Tom Dean Hudson, Ohio"}
{"text":"One of the best gluten free pizzas we've had!  I dined here for my Fiance's, Grandfather's, 90th Birthday. In all I think there was something close to 20 of us. A reservation was placed but, due to some unforeseen circumstances, it was changed and we all showed up a bit early. (Someone phoned ahead to let them know)  Zeppes was very accommodating, their staff was great, and their food was fantastic!  We don't eat gluten (my fiance has Celiac) so we were quite happy to see that they had a gluten free pizza on the menu. This was, hands down, the best gluten free pizza that we have ever enjoyed.  Thanks to Zeppes for having gluten free pizza and taking care of us!  I will not hesitate to return!!!"}
{"text":"We had never eaten at this pizzeria before. We had a larger group and I called ahead to see if they could accommodate us. They were very good at getting us in. The waiter was very attentive to our needs. Dos was exactly what you would expect from a restaurant that serves pizza-awesome. The last point that really stuck out was they did not add the gratuity into the bill. Overall a really great experience."}
{"text":"Slow horrible service literally waited for over and HOUR for food and by the time we got our pizzas we scarfed it down and didn't care how bland and tasteless it was. But I hear the margaritas are to die for so I guess they have that going for them."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner last night for delivery. They have great pizza, sauce, ingredients everything is right on target including the \"zig zag crust\". My biggest disappointment was ordering a salad to bring to work the next day for lunch. They put the dressing on the salad so the next day it was less than tasty. Not sure why you would deliver a salad with the dressing already on it."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars for food and 0 stars for atmosphere, hence the 3 star rating. They really do have some of the best food around. However, the atmosphere makes me cringe. I don't think the owner has a clue how disruptive he is. He conducts business up in the bar area all the time, and his voice is so loud as he talks either in person or on the cell phone. He swears all the time, which I find offensive. All of the staff have their families in and out, which drives me crazy. These kids sit at the tables by the bar and do their homework. When I'm there, I want to enjoy my food, not listen to family sagas or business dealings or watch kids dart back and forth with their tennis shoes with the flashing lights. Most of the servers, especially the females, are just so unfriendly. More often than not, they just slide the bill onto the table as they're walking past without saying a word. If they would start treating this like a business, they wouldn't have room for all the customers, their food is that good. Oh, and just noticed the picture below of  what they call jo-jos. They are NOT jo-jos, so if you're expecting something other than frozen wedges, don't order them."}
{"text":"Horrible. As a long time Hudson resident, I really enjoy supporting the local businesses which is exactly why I was happy to dine here with 5 of my closest girlfriends this past Weds. night. What a disaster and a mistake. I will gladly choose to leave town for better service, and a waitress that doesn't act as if we are ruining her night just by choosing to dine at Zeppes. We arrived at 6pm and weren't even able to place our orders until 6:45. How is a 45 minute wait acceptable? Well, if you ask crotchety pants waitress lady, she'll tell you that she \"sees a table full of women and expects we are there to talk and in no hurry.\" Actually, every one of us had a full day of work to return to the next day, christmas shopping to be complete, topped off with a 6 month old baby sitting there ready for her bedtime. The wait for food continued to be of ridiculous nature, and there was never the \"how is your food\" standard follow up. Instead, \"where is the baby?\"...Um, she had to be picked up by grandpa, because it is now 8pm and we are just getting our food. No response... She should be fired and Zeppes should be embarrassed by the lack of service that seems to be a common theme in these reviews."}
{"text":"This is an extremely tasty and high quality pizza. They clearly don't skimp on the ingredients. It's exactly what I'm looking in a pizza: just the right amount of sauce that is not too sweet/not too tomatoey, plenty of quality mozzarella, cooked just right for a chewy middle and slightly crunchy edge with the ingredients right to the edge. Service is timely and friendly - your business feels appreciated. This sums up my latest visit (today) and every other visit."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Delicious pasta, excellent salads, decent wine list. Calzones to die for. Wonderful outdoor patio. Great for groups. Take out service and home delivery. Bartender keeps all the patrons smiling. Awesome calamari served two ways."}
{"text":"Very good pizza for delivery. Sauce is just right, pepperoni is thick and tasty, dough/crust is perfect and sizes are big! Always a good deal available also."}
{"text":"When I think of E Side CLE-style pizza, I think Zeppe's. Pan-style pizza with crimped crust like Geppetto's and Longo's, and a zesty sauce. Of the three, Zeppe's has the best sauce. this location is cool because it has a very well-decorated, large dining room and brewskies on tap. Been there many times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I have had consistently bad service every time I eat here. The waitstaff act more like an annoying friend rather than a server. For me this is really only one step up from A Fazoli's."}
{"text":"Great pizza great bar and everyone friendly . The menu is great the angel hair pasta the best and sauce is great"}
{"text":"Really busy and no warning that the kitchen was backed up. But despite all that they managed to serve a good meal in a fairly reasonable time. The food, though, is average. It's not the best around but it's far better than most in the area. The atmosphere is busy but nice and quaint."}
{"text":"Delicious food with a large menu and outside dining available.  The pizza is great, but so is the breadsticks and wide variety of non-pizza menu items.  Friendly staff, prices average.  They don't deliver to our area, but we like to dine in sometimes.  :)"}
{"text":"Great family run business! Affordable and yummy.  I had the caprese to start, they used great balsamic.  Chicken , not sure on the spelling but it was great.  Sides pasta and steamed veggies.  The marinara in the pasta could use little love but everything was super yummy and filling.  I finished with a canoli my go to italian desert.  They ran out of filling for our second one but the one I had was good, the filling could of been little firmer but it was so good!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. A very long wait if you order Pizza and a salad. Family restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Hudson. Pizzas are fantastic (try the Southwestern-the name is deceptive, it's not Tex-Mex, maybe southwestern Italy?) and the entrees home style Italian. Zeppe's is not pretentious or expensive, just good Italian comfort food with great service."}
{"text":"May 29 7pm we ate there and the staff just walks around dirty tables and is very slow to attend to dirty dishes sitting next to us. The kitchen staff would come out often to talk to waitresses and get pop in plane view of us diners delaying servers from serving Overall lacks management pizza C+ salads A"}
{"text":"I took my kiddos and we had a great time.  Friendly staff quick service even though they were slammed.  Gluten free pizza was good and salads delicious.  Bourbun bbq wings delicious!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My sister's friend worked here so we would stop in for pizza once in a while. They have a great menu full of pastas, salads and pizza. The service is friendly and the meal is not overly priced!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy the food here. Spend time with our family at this restaurant over the years. The people working there are just fantastic and always treat us very well."}
{"text":"Awful service. The dining room was about 1/3 full and I counted 5 workers who didn't appear to be super busy. The only one who seemed to care at all about quality service was the young male expediter. Our server literally ignored us. It took 15 mins for someone to take our order, then 40 mins to get our food. She wasn't friendly and never acknowledged the length of our wait(s) at any point. No refills during our wait. No one ever checked to see if our food was okay. Then, we sat looking at our empty plates for about 15 mins. We were given and charged for a larger pizza than we asked for. The male expediter refilled our drinks, brought our food, to go box and our check. He did everything. On our way out, our server was on her phone texting near the bar. I might expect that work ethic from a young server but this was a middle aged woman. I wish my tip could have gone entirely to the  boy actually doing his job. I was a server for 10 years and  usually cut people some slack. This was unacceptable."}
