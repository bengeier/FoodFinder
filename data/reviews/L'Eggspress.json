{"text":"The dish was good, but the service was just normal. We had to serve the coffee ourselves and nobody told us there was a special menu on the weekend ... Usually other breakfast places are more welcoming than that. I guess this place is ok if you don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect.  Classic and hearty omelettes.  The homefries are very good!  Went once about a year ago and got fruit to replace the homefries and a huge pile of ornately cut fruit appeared.  Went back this week and that was gone :-( Just a normal old bowl of fruit."}

Came here for brunch around 12pm on a TUESDAY and found the place 90% full which tends to be a good sign!

We were promptly seated and service was decent. What I like about this breakfast joint is that they leave you with a small thermal pitcher with coffee that you can self serve until you drink it all. 

The reason I can't give my experience a 5 stars however is due to the filtered coffee being mediocre. It plugged the caffeine hole so to speak but it tasted weak. #Notmycup.

Another negative point is parking can be an issue but I can't blame them too much for it. 

I went with their Belle Helene which consists of a pair of thin crepes filled with yummy cream and fruits under a blanket of strawberries and strawberry sweet sauce. It was sweet but not eniugh to be sickening. It was very good!

I'd definitely would come again and try this plate again or maybe another."}
