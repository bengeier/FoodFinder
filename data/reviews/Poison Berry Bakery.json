{"text":"Recently went to this cozy and inviting bakery and café.  Owner very pleasant.  Enjoyed coffee and delicious apple critters while sitting at a cute round table.  Purchased lots of goodies to bring home.  Will definitely return to Poison Berry Bakery & Café."}
{"text":"My first trip to Poison Berry was awesome! There are finally good vegan donuts in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Very good vegan & gluten sensitivity option bakery~ All day Saturday breakfast is my favorite. I especially like the waffles, tofu scramble, cake balls, & donuts. The staff is very friendly & the storefront is cute/ comfortable. I'm so happy they finally opened a brick & mortar."}
{"text":"Donut Wednesdays. You do not want to miss it. I had a vegan maple \"bacon\" donut and it was out of this world! Can't wait to try all of the flavors. Delicious coffee too."}
{"text":"So glad I was able to visit this gem all the way from Houston! Absolutely amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and even better vegan treats! OMGSH So the first time I visited it was for the vegan pizza day and that was delish. This is my second visit and I got the oatmeal vs. chocolate chip cookie(heavenly), zucchini bread, banana chocolate chip bread, glazed donut, and a cookie cup. I will definitely make a trip from the west side to the east for their yummy selections again. You can also get their treats at Nature's Oasis so that's a plus when I can't make it to the east side."}
{"text":"Great vegan bakery and cafe. Service with a smile. They're still a little fresh (pun intended) and could use a little fine tuning, but all in all a great experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I went in because the bakery had a sign proclaiming that it has the best coffee in the world. While I was extremely skeptical, I have to admit that it is actually some of the best coffee I've ever had. The (incredibly knowledgeable and friendly) chef/coffee expert behind the counter told us that it comes from Solstice Roasters right here in Cleveland, which is kind of cool. 

Since it's a bakery, we also went ahead and tried some of the vegan cupcakes. To be polite. 

Oh my God. So tasty. They were better than gourmet cupcakes from Food Network-endorsed bakeries I've been to in DC and NYC. I have no idea how they do it without butter; they must be wizards. 

The place itself is on the small side, so I wouldn't necessarily plan on hanging out (it's the only downside that I can think of), but I'd definitely recommend stopping by or maybe using them to cater your next event."}
{"text":"I seriously can't understand how the cashew milk latte is so good. I keep thinking I've overblown it in my mind, but it's always just as amazing when I try it again.

The chocolate cranberry muffin and banananut muffin have well-developed, complex flavors.

They had a pumpkin pie latte (soy milk), with an amazing soy whipped cream. How is everything so delicious?"}
{"text":"Amazing vegan bakery! Every time I go I am impressed and delighted by the numerous treats and desserts available! Recently I got a couple cookies and cupcakes for a friend's birthday. The staff was wonderful and they helped me pick everything out and also arranged things nicely in their cute little pink box. I am happy to say that my friend loved her goodies !"}
{"text":"Walking the Larchmere neighborhood we came upon Poison Berry Bakery, cute little vegan owned and operated bakery. Specializing in a wide variety of vegan treats from cupcakes, donuts, cookies, muffins and confections. We tried their birthday cake donuts and cookie dough bites. They were fantastic! Not being a vegan myself I couldn't taste the difference. Really good for vegans or non vegans!"}
{"text":"I went here after sampling some items at an event which were delicious. When I came to the store the staff didn't seem too interested in my presence and barely returned conversation. I brought up the fact that I had their offerings at an event and they couldn't barley respond back about what I tried. I tried to ask her suggestion on items and she didn't really help and she seemed bothered when I changed my mind on what I wanted to order. While checking me out she started a conversation with someone else and I lingered for a while like uhh am I done? So i grabbed my bag, pulled my card out of the machine, and said thank you...no response. I said thank you again as I was leaving thinking doesnt thank you go both ways or at least responded too in a goods and services transaction? Left thinking wow that was a weird vibe. Maybe it was an off day but I wouldn't go back in anytime soon with a bunch of other bakeries out there passionate about not only their item and location but their visitors as well! The muffins that I got were pretty good and large...just under $10 for both I think. I'm bummed to write a moderate review as I see everyone else loves them so much...just doing my best to be transparent about my experience!"}
{"text":"So adorable, so delicious! This cute little vegan bakery is a gem. We tried the bff truffels which were delicious chocolate covered peanut butter truffels with a tiny bit of jelly in the middle. There were apple \"critters\" aka mini fritters at the counter which I thought were fun, although the girl taking my order didn't find it so amusing. We also split a lemon cupcake which was moist, and full of flavor. Lastly, I had an Americano that was to die for. 

It's small inside, but bright and full of color.

My only complaint is the grumpy girl who took my order. Everything else was amazing."}
{"text":"The staff here is always friendly and as a young queer person it's a super comfy place. The donuts are fun and yummy and the rotating breakfast menus they do on Saturdays are always great. The decor is scary cute, with cupcakes with vampire teeth coming to get you.

I've been a vegan for about half my life now, and I've been to a lot of vegan bakeries. This vegan bakery is a lot more like a typical bakery in its offerings. The donuts are fried, not baked or raw or something like you might see in the yoga-raw-gf type places (I know you know what I mean). They do have gluten sensitive options for people with allergies, but most things have gluten in them. They have donuts, cookies, cake balls, brownies, muffins, quiche, and other items in their regular offerings but sometimes have special things around holidays, like pies."}
{"text":"What a cute little bakery/cafe! I came in here on a Friday afternoon. The bakery is small. I don't know if there is more seating that I was missing. Everything here is vegan! Everything! Food menu, coffee drinks, and desserts! 
I was greeted upon walking in to the bakery. There was a nice case of desserts in the entrance way. There are more options on top of the case and by the cash register. In the glass case there were plentiful flavors of cupcakes drinks breads pastries and prepared food in containers. By the register there are muffins and breads. On top of the case I saw brownies and a German chocolate cake. Everything looked Devine! I chose the red velvet cupcakes, a piece of zucchini bread for later, and a medium drip coffee. The coffee is locally sourced. The drip coffee is from solstice coffee roasters in cleveland and the specialty drinks use Six Shooters coffee! The coffee was very tasty. At the condiment hutch there is stevia sugar, soy and almond creamer, and ice water.
The staff was very welcoming and my questions were answered. I was told that Saturday's there is all day brunch! I must come back for that. It's 10am to 6pm! I hope there is more seating because I can see this place filling up fast on Saturday's.
The bakery decor is so cute. Bright colors and the cutest throw dessert pillows on the seating bench! I sat and enjoyed my coffee and cupcake.
I totally recommend this place for vegans and non vegans. You can't tell the difference. The frosting on my cupcake was so good! Larchmere has quite the selection of local eateries. This would be a great place to come after a dinner or before/after your session at Larchmere Fireworks! Awesome glass pieces made there. Stop in!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute vegan bakery in my childhood neighborhood. This place is a part of the emerging bakery row on larchmere and I definitely will be returning to visit the other bakeries on the strip the next time I'm in town. 

I came on a Sunday afternoon because of a pop up collaboration they were having with Urban Sweetness, a vegan soul food restaurant. When we got there a little before 12 and before the bakery opened there was already a line out the door! That got me excited because I never wait in line for food and the fact that people were doing in here let me know that I was in for a treat. 

My family ended up grabbing some of the soul food and I tried the double chocolate cupcake made by the bakery itself. It was my first vegan cupcake and I couldn't even tell a difference. It was delicious! They had lots to choose from that day like cookies, breads, coffee and other prepackaged snacks. I was only slightly disappointed that they didn't have any carrot cake but the chocolate was fine. 

My review most likely is not representative of the typical experience at Poison Berry which is why I only gave 4 stars but I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town to visit family because of the cool decor, concept and their collab with another amazing vegan restaurant in the city. Seriously so cool! Good job for Cleveland, stepping it up in the trendy food arena."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! My 4 year old and I stop by every time we are in the neighborhood. Brought home some cupcakes for the family one night and they didn't believe they were vegan! My son always enjoys their giant cookies and donuts. Well done!"}
{"text":"Everything here is vegan, I asked upon entering and the employee behind the counter gave me a weird look since I didn't realize every single thing they have is vegan. The cupcake variety is small and some don't have descriptions.  I've had to ask what flavor they are every time I've been and no one really knows. They are very tasty but I'm pretty sure the cupcake itself is the same flavor with just a different frosting.  They are $3.50-4 each and pretty small but it is a small business so I understand the cost. I'm not sure if I'll go back because of the staff."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly. As a non-vegan person, I enjoy their treats just as much as regular baked goods. The texture of their baked goods are denser and slightly gummier than regular goodies which is common with vegan goodies. Everything is pretty cheap for what it is; some people take the trendy \"vegan\" label and run with it but no singular baked good at Poisonberry is more than $4. They also sell a few coffee drinks, kombucha, jerky, and other assorted snacks."}
{"text":"The cupcakes were delicious, however, the customer service, or lack there of, will keep me from coming back. The woman who helped me seemed very annoyed by me asking questions and not immediately knowing what I wanted because I had never been there before. I went here for birthday cupcakes because Cleveland Vegan is closed on Mondays. Next time I'll just get my CV cupcakes on Sunday."}
{"text":"Such a pleasant place to enjoy a hot, tasty cup of coffee. Places like this are what other places like Starbucks lack. Charm, warmth, and atmosphere. I'm not vegan, but the coffee I've drank at vegan coffee shops have always been amazing and this place is no different. The pastries that are sold here are also tasty and the perfect compliment to your cup of java. If you are in Larchmere and need some caffeine, please visit this place. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Super yummy vegan treats. Where do I begin this review? I popped in here real quick to check it out because I was in the area on Friday evening (27 April 2018). I bought the blueberry bread and a slice of Germany Chocolate cake. Both were delicious with my favourite being the blueberry bread.

They opened in April 2017 so they just celebrated their 1 year anniversary which is awesome for a small business.

DRINKS -- They have tea which I love. 

DECOR -- Although this is a small establishment, it is super cute inside. I love the pink walls and decorative pillows. If you want to come in to sit for their all-day breakfast, then show up early as sitting may be limited.

SWEETS -- This is a bakery (DUH!) so you'll find cupcakes, cakes, cookies, and more. I have tried their German Chocolate Cake, Blueberry Lemon bread, and Zucchini bread. I've also tried their hot breakfast. I had a nice conversation with Allie on Friday and she told me that she made the recipe for the german chocolate cake and the icing is another recipe from her mom's side of the family. You can also buy vegan chocolate bars which are made with natural sugar. The german chocolate cake had coconut on it which for me personally, I didn't like as much but the cake was still good. 

BREAKFAST/BRUNCH ALL DAY -- On Saturdays, they serve all day breakfast from 10am - 6pm. I came here a second time on Saturday, April 28th with my friend Estefania. I ordered the combo breakfast which came out to be $13. Quiet expensive but it was a packed breakfast. It came with vegan sausage, vegan eggs (which was a tofu scramble), potatoes, and french toast. I loved the potatoes and sausage but did not like the tofu scramble which has nothing to do with this place but rather my own tastebud preference. I've had tofu before and liked it so I think the way this was cooked was different than what I am used to. I also bought the blueberry bread again for myself and a friend and I tried the Zucchini bread from my friend Estefania. I prefer the blueberry bread than the zucchini bread. 

SERVICE - Awesome! Allie and Pam were great to chat with. I spoke to Pam on Friday and Saturday. She told be about her vegan story on Friday and how she moved from being a vegetarian to a vegan. It's great to see that she actually cares about the vegan lifestyle.

FUN FACT -- This used to be a former hair salon per the lady who sat next to the table I was sitting on. The more you know.... 

I'll be back to try their cupcakes and cookies.

This is my 83rd Yelp review overall.

{"text":"Loved this place! Tried the matcha cupcake and the lemon cupcake and both were delicious! They also had some great looking quiches. The place itself is super cute and inviting and the coffee was good."}
{"text":"In addition to being a seriously killer vegan patisserie, Poison Berry also offers knock-your-socks-off baked goods for the gluten-intolerant. HUZZAH! To date, I have tried donuts, cupcakes, and brownies from their gluten-sensitive selection and all have been delectable. The vanilla cupcake with chocolate frosting was particularly wonderful! Whether or not you have any dietary restrictions, I recommend making a visit to this little gem of the Larchmere neighborhood to get yourself a sugar buzz."}
{"text":"Visited this bakery for my daughter's birthday. She was in search of vanilla cupcakes but ended up getting a cinnamon roll. We also purchased a raspberry chocolate chip muffin and a piece of zucchini bread. Everything was really good. We went to another vegan bakery for treats to bring home but Poison Berry's sweets were better."}
