{"text":"Oh my Olive I this this place oufffffffffffffffffffff gives me chillllz, they got the goood stufff here!!! must try special of the day"}
{"text":"A Lively and energetic atmosphere for a Friday night, combined with an excellent draft list and good (French) pub food, made a excellent first meal in Montreal.   The vegetarian chili special was hearty and flavorful with a nice shape cheddar gratin - I was satisfied even as a carnivore."}
{"text":"With 30+ beers on tap, including some really niche and innovative ones, this place was already in my good books. The giant terrasse out back is great on a summer evening. And the food is bistro fare prepared with panache, small-ish reasonable portions leaving more room for the beer. Chill atmosphere. Service on the slow side but friendly enough. Come for a nice leisurely night out with friends, and stay awhile."}
{"text":"If you're a beer lover in Montreal, it can be difficult to expand the bar circuit beyond Dieu Du Ciel and the lesser competitors such as Benelux, BDM, and such.  Between the great beer selection and the way above average bar food, it was well worth the detour.  Pros - very fair prices, especially on food - the pulled pork poutine, as well as the sausage plate, are damn good. - 30 Quebec beers on tap. Nice.  Cons - out of the way - mediocre to average service - uninspiring indoor ambiance  Will def go back"}
{"text":"Want to sample some of the best suds Quebec has to offer? Make sure you stop at this exceptional bar, which has at any given time about 30+ brews exclusively brewed in Quebec on tap. It's such a joy to walk into an establishment and not see the same ole craft regulars on tap, even in Montreal. V&V has a comfy atmosphere even when crowded, which it often is, although it has recently expanded to stuff more ale-lovers in.  They have live music certain nights, tasty nibbles, and a cute terrace for sipping pretty in the warmer months. Highly recommended. Only downfall is that it's a bit outta the way."}
{"text":"I'll give a two on five, just because of the local craft beers list. I mean when they got all the range full, not 20 on 30.   Unfortunately, vice and versa got two huge issues: - a non welcoming staff, who seems to be tired of serving you or answering your questions - the very poor knowledge in beer, which for a craft beer pub is sad.  Anyway, French fries are really good."}
{"text":"One of the worst service in Montreal.....No smile, no help...on top of that they know almost nothing about beer. I ask for some tasting notes on a season, the answer was \"oh it's a season\", vey helpful....Don't go unless you know your beer and don't tip !"}
{"text":"They have so many different kinds of beer! What a taste experience. Thanks Yelp for the party it was excellent to meet Montreal Yelpers in person."}
{"text":"Great beer selection a terrace in the back.  And ever since they expanded its not the crowded mess it use to be."}
{"text":"If you're a beer connoisseur then this place is for you. Quite a large beer menu for any discerning palate and a decent liquor selection as well. Inside was bigger than it let on from the street and it gets \"busy but never crowded...much.\" You don't even have to shout to be heard across the table which is another good sign. So if you're looking for a good seat then get there early. A great casual hangout in the bar area but if you can score a table on the back patio then it's perfect for enjoying a brew with friends under the stars. Plus your date can watch the fireflies while you catch the basketball game going on right next to the patio: everyone wins.  Otherwise, pretty good service and helpful. My first time there I asked for an amber lager and the bartender promptly gave me two samples to see what I liked more...or you can save some time by going to their website and look up whatever you fancy. Show up with the drink number or name and you're good to go otherwise you could be there awhile...going over your choices."}
{"text":"The bartender knows her sh*t. Excellent service, beautiful terasse and overall great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Good Craft Beers from Local Microbreweries and legit Poutine. The cheese and gravy was delicious. We shared a plate per two people. Nice place to catch up with friends and enjoy the breeze. Their wide open windows makes you feel connected to the outside environment."}
{"text":"Le Vice & Versa propose tout un attirail de bières de microbrasseries québécoises qui sauront combler au plus haut point le bièrophile curieux et assoiffé... Cette vitrine du terroir est de loin l'une des meilleures pour se familiariser avec l'univers brassicole québécois en plein foisonnement. C'est plus d'une trentaine de bières artisanales que vous pourrez déguster sur place, dont 5 créations de la maison. Les brasseurs sollicités sont nombreux : Brasseurs et Frères, Dunham, À la fût, Trois Mousquetaires, Naufrageur, Pit Caribou, Brasseurs de Montréal, Dieu du Ciel! Trou du Diable, À l'abri de la tempête, l'Alchimiste, AMB, Barberie, Broadway, Bièropholie, Bierbrier, Hopfenstark... Il est à noter que la sélection est variable et que peuvent s'ajouter ou se retirer certains brasseurs (incidemment certaines bières)... Peu importe, un fait demeure, c'est que chacun y trouvera son compte.  Voulant sans cesse promouvoir les produits québécois, ce bistro du terroir offre conséquemment une excellente cuisine gourmande se mariant parfaitement avec une chope de bonne bibine... On succombe facilement aux sandwichs bavarois et à la viande fumée ou encore aux pizzas... On y sert également plusieurs plateaux de vices fromageux et amuse-gueule...  L'allure ancienne du bistro, tout fait de bois, s'inspire assurément d'une forme de folklore québécois. C'est d'ailleurs la meilleure décoration qu'il pouvait adopter, étant donné les produits offerts, d'autant que la maison propose chaque mardi soir, à 21h, des sessions de musiques traditionnelles!   Le Vice & Versa est aussi un espace artistique ; les artistes peuvent exposer gratuitement leurs uvres... Quelques soirées thématiques sont aussi parfois organisées. Je  me souviens y être allé lors d'une soirée de contes érotiques, où plusieurs conteurs, à tour de rôle, racontaient des histoires lubriques parfois très cocasses... Le plus valeureux, qui se qualifiait de philosophe-sexologue et répondait au nom d'André Moreau, distribuait même ses livres gratuitement..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed having dinner and drinks at Vices et Versa. We researched some dinner options on Yelp and decided on this one. We ordered 2 of the sour beers which were really tasty. We also got the bison burger and the chicken quesadilla. The meals were perfect. It was great going to a neighborhood spot and avoiding some of the more touristy spots. Lively upbeat crowd. I highly recommend this place and will probably go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came here after reading yelp reviews and was happy I did. Great local beer selection and amazing bison burger. Back porch is relaxing place to hang out on a summer's afternoon. Service is a bit lacking in terms of warmth/friendliness, but overall it's a good spot."}
{"text":"This place used to be better, now the staff act like V & V is the only game in town and it's your duty as a paying customer to put up with the slow and unfriendly service. It's true, they have a good selection of beers. Tonight it took me and my friend about 25 minutes to get one drink, OK, no problem, it's a busy Thursday night. We paid and tipped well. We finished that drink and our waiter was nowhere to be seen. Eventually a different server came by and we put in an order with her. 25 minutes later, still no drinks. We decided to give them 10 more minutes, then we would leave. As we got up to leave, our original waiter reappeared and asked if we were going outside for a smoke. No, I told him politely, we got tired of waiting, the service was unacceptable and we were leaving. He made up a story about seeing me walk out on a drink before. I said that was very interesting, he knows things about me that I don't even know myself--when was that? He said three years ago. I said he was the best waiter in the World if he could remember that--his talents were wasted at a joint like this. Whatever. The point is a real problem with the service came up and instead of apologizing and trying to make it right, our server got confrontational and made up a story about us being nuisance customers.  Bottom line: You will really make your Vices et Versa server's day if choose to go somewhere else for a drink.  If you have to check this place out, go for an afternoon pint, don't waste your time on a busy evening."}
{"text":"What better to do on an early summer afternoon that to eat drink and be merry with friends?  When deciding where to get a bite for dinner I was sold the second my friend suggested pulled pork poutine.  It was so delicious.  savoury chunks of falling-apart pork, atop of soft chunky fries, smothered in a creamy gravy.  At la banquise i can normally only eat about half a poutine, but not here my friends.   I tried the blanche ginger beer, which was about as ginger-y as something can get save from sucking on a stalk, but it was a good choice for me, as it forced me to sip slowly.  Otherwise I may have had 3 or 4 or more pints of their fabulous selection of beers on tap.    Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nice list of micro brews. Decent pub grub with a twist.  If you're looking for a solid pint and a bite to eat in Little Italy, Vice et Versa can probably accommodate you. Their list of micro brews is impressive, offering a flavor for just about any taste. Their menu is perfectly suited for complementing a couple pints, offering a bit of a bourgeois twist instead of a run-of-the-mill pub grub."}
{"text":"Great place, great pulled pork poutine, great beer choices most of all. Too bad Caroline is a bitch"}
{"text":"Great beer and an excellent back patio. Did I mention they have great beer?   Pints are $1 off before 7 PM."}
{"text":"Meilleur endroit dans le quartier pour prendre une bière. En plus d'avoir une panoplie de produits locaux, on y retrouve en permanence une trentaine de bières du Québec. L'ambiance est excellente et la musique toujours très bonne. Seul défaut, victime de son succès, l'endroit est souvent bondé..."}
{"text":"solid list of microbrews and an intimate yet spacious back terrasse.  small list of simple but good sharing-type nibbles.  go for the beer and late night garden talks.  try: biere gingembre, 3 Bock, hefeweizen."}
{"text":"A friend of mine oliveee, is having is birthday bash here and invited me to this pub . The place has the ambience and energy that you want to go back again . There was a band playing for the Quebec tap dance . I couldn't stop tapping my feet and dancing to the music . They say that was the last performance of the band playing for this year , on every Tuesday. They come back next year December . The beers were great and if you cannot pronounce there name , just tell them the number and you are good . The persons who wants to taste most of the beers and get drunk while your friends drive  you home, I think this is your place ."}
{"text":"I went here last weekend for a birthday party and I felt like it was my birthday. What a sweet spot this place is...aside from the fact that it's just too far from my house! Why can't it be my own neighborhood \"Cheers\" bar?!  First of all, I love beer so the enormous selection was extremely tempting...I wanted to try them all, except tasting countless beers would inevitably lead to me falling off my bar stool. Been there, done that. Second of all, the music was excellent. I don't know who the DJ was, but I'd date his taste in music. My friends and I gathered up some tables and danced in our chairs until the wee hours. The ambiance of this place is where it's at! Brick walls, warm light, and chalk boards filled with the longest Christmas list of beers I've ever seen! Sadly, the patio was punched so we didn't get to hang out with the outdoor crowd. But, alas, there's always a next time...and there will be a next time...I can already hear the beer calling my name...or is that the DJ?"}
{"text":"This is the Montreal equivalent of Bar Volo. I love this place so much. Huge beer selection. Outdoor patio is so romantic. The guy sitting next to me had a tattoo of a giant hop. Like, wow, you're such a big fan of beer that you got that tattooed! Damn! My partner and I left wanting more beer but also made sweet love in our hotel afterward so that was a good alternate. Yeah, you had to know that."}
{"text":"A beer taster's heaven and a highlight of any Montreal trip.  One of the coolest cities in the world also has one if the most expansive Quebec draught lists, and you can order them in different sized including tasting trays. Very well presented by servers and all beer in Montreal is reasonably priced, unlike Toronto.  Very satisfying place to visit.a bit north and east of Dieu du Ciel! brew pub and worth the hike."}
{"text":"Great place and terrace. The terrace is beautiful with little lights.  They have lots of choices. The only thing I would recommend is splitting on the boards with the lists of beers the types that would be very helpful. Staff super kind. I recommend that they sit with Wes! Very attentive."}
{"text":"Great beer list, very friendly staff. Oliver went out of his way to show me a great time. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"When we first walked in, I thought it was closed because it was absolutely desolate in its dining room. However, if you continue to walk through to the patio, this is where the party is at! With temperatures in the high 70s to low 80s and a full day spent walking, a fresh beverage on a breezy deck was exactly what we needed.  Although we had originally planned to hit up another spot, we decided to venture into Vices et Versa because the patio area seemed nice, the local tap list also carried brews from Dieu du Ciel and there was more of a local vibe/atmosphere, which is much appreciated without having to fight for a server's attention, nah mean?  It's a seat yourself kind of place and menus are already on the table. If you don't know what beer to get, ask your server. They are super helpful with trying to match to your preferences with options to sample. Since it was warm out, I was feeling something on the lighter side like a blonde or lager. I was given five suggestions and decided to go with the Blanche de L'ermitage, which was comparable to a Blue Moon with a Belgian finish.  Since we had spent most of the day exploring museums and walking downtown, we had worked up an appetite. With three options for poutine, we asked our server what would be best. For sweet, she suggested the pulled pork and for savory, the chipolata (pork sausage). We went with the savory option to pair with a small green salad to share.  Portions are pretty fair in terms of food. The chipolata tasted like a lighter version of longanisa (Filipino sausage) without the crazy garlic burps. Poutine was drenched in beer gravy with plenty of cheese string pulls, but even better that I didn't feel heavy after consumption. The salad was a very good mix of leaves, almonds, olives, julienned carrots and tomatoes.  Menu is small, but the focus is the beer list, which taps at least 30 different options from Canada. Breweries such as Dieu du Ciel, Brasserie Dunham, Unfiltered Brewing (Nova Scotia), Casa Breton had a solid representation on the list. Wished I was more knowledgeable about Canadian beers to really enjoy/explore the options, but I'll be more prepared whenever I plan to return to Canada."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert cet endroit pour le party de départ de notre cher MP nationale !  J'ai adoré leur burger de saumon, c'était très généreux comme portion et totalement délicieux. Du côté de la sélection de bières, il y en avait pour tous les goûts et de tous les coins du monde. J'ai plutôt opté pour du cidre, car lorsqu'il fait très chaud, c'est à mon sens beaucoup plus rafraîchissant, et encore la, pas déçue du tout par leur choix !!! (il y en avait même a 11% d'alcool... pas sûre que j'aurais tenu debout longtemps hihi)   Je ne suis pas restée longtemps mais j'y retournerais c'est sur ! Beau petit pub, et belle terrasse aussi, ne l'oublions pas !"}
{"text":"Idéal pour boire un verre tout en mangeant de la nourriture de pub. Les plats sont copieux et abordables dans une ambiance et un décor chaleureux"}
{"text":"The back patio is amazing! In a city that is so cold so much of the year, nobody would blame a little brew-pub like this for maximizing their square footage with indoor space. Instead they serve their pulled pork poutine and make-your-own carousels (6 beer flights) under a canopy of tree branches.  Our server was kind and attentive. We asked him to make us a carousel with his faves, and he gave us quite an interesting variety. When he found out we were from the States, he went back to the kitchen to write down a few of his favorite local breweries and their addresses on a sticky note for us. So thoughtful!  Honestly, the food won't blow you away. But if you need a simple dinner or a bar snack while you're sipping and chatting a lazy evening away, you'll find something to enjoy.  Highly recommend, at least in the warmer months."}
{"text":"A must for any fan of microbrews or those who like to sample local flavors while traveling.  My Montreal friends invited me to this bar since my hotel happened to be in an area way too bra' for them. If you're staying downtown you can grab a bus heading up St Laurent and get off in Little Italy. If it's warm enough try to grab a seat in the intimate back patio close to the extensive chalkboard beer list.   My Montreal friends mentioned you can order a \"tasting\" of any 5 beers listed in a row. Whatever; just pick and choose. The IPAs were fantastic. Prices were very reasonable (~$6/pint)."}
{"text":"Casual bar with delicious nosh. Octopus was perfectly cooked and poutine was delightful. Sweet tunes and a backyard. Felt like we were home in Brooklyn."}
{"text":"Why are you reading Yelp ? Go here now. Great beers ; solid meals ; and knowledgable staff. As a beer nut I can fully attest that this place has it all. It's an easy bus ride from the more touristy areas of the city."}
{"text":"Last day of a week trip in Montreal and stumbled upon this place.  Gotta say I hit the jackpot.  Lots of awesome beer... tried 3 for the first time and much pleased.  Tacos De Porc Effiloche was awesome bar food.  Music selections were on point.  Great way to end a 3 hour walking tour in the non-touristy parts of Montreal.  Everyone is super courteous and service is excellent.  Will definitely come back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Awesome menu for a pub it really is gastronomic food. Beer selections are incredible. There's a flavour for every palate. Wait service depends on who you get but mine was beyond awesome and easy on the eyes too ;-)"}
{"text":"Beer selection - 5 stars Overall experience - 4 stars  This was the farthest I travelled for my Montreal beer fix... but absolutely worth it. The pub is more north on St. Laurent so i suggest taking the metro or a cab if your from out of town. Two key features that make the trek worth it - 1) best beer selection in Montreal and 2) cool laid back vibe.  They had 33 beers on tap during my visit - all listed on the chalkboard with the brewer name & price. Beers were mostly $6.50 or $7 a pint.  All the  beers appeared to be from local Quebec brewers including: Dieu Du Ciel, Brasserie Dunham, Brasseurs du Monde, Charlevoix , le Trèfle Noir and at least 5-6 more.  I joined my friends late so only had time for two pints so I went with the godly Dieu Du Ciel Peche Mortel and the Blanche du Paradis, also from Dieu Du Ciel. Next time I will try many more.    Servers were on the run the whole night, I think there was just two of them despite the full house. You had to waive one down to order your next pint which was a little frustrating. Like many of the other Montreal beer pubs, you can not run a tab.  Staff spoke English so no worries if your from out of town. Staff was friendly.  Didn't try the food but the Belgium Fries, Bisson burger and poutine all looked amazingly good.   TIP: Join their Facebook page to get daily beer menu updates - in English & French.  This will be the first stop on my next Montreal visit and I will stay for the evening to try more of the beer selections. Highly recommended...  BK"}
{"text":"With a grand selection and variety of beers, everyone can satisfy their personal taste, you just can't go wrong at Vices et Versa! We sat outside on the patio, which had a nice feel to it. My friends and I had a bunch of different degustation pairings that included white, blonde, and amber beers, as well as cider! They were all delicious, my least favorite one being the ginger beer. My friend ordered a pizza for herself, it was perfectly sized for a single eater and tasted delicious (she was nice enough to give me a bite!).   The server was accommodating, friendly, attentive, and helpful. I was especially impressed when he told my friend that her pizza had accidentally been overcooked and burned a little, so they were making her a brand new one. I commend and respect that very much because many places are more interested in your wallet than in your satisfaction. It's a shame when they don't care about the quality of the food they're pushing, Vices et Versa on the other hand does care and it shows."}
{"text":"Good selection of craft local beers and fantastic burger. We were looking for a chill local brewery-type place while visiting Montreal. We looked up some places online and decided on Vices et Versa because it seemed like a cool place. The beers were good and they had a pretty good selection of various local beers. My friend and I got burgers and they were excellent. The service was great and cool decor. Overall a great beer/burger scene. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a chill local beer/burger place while wandering around Montreal."}
{"text":"With dozens of locally brewed beers on draft and above-average pub food, this place has a lot going for it. On a sunny day, you won't get a seat on the terrace unless you arrive unfashionably early. But if you have to stay inside, don't worry -- after 2 rounds of pale ale, you won't even notice the drab interior."}
{"text":"Best beer selection that I've seen anywhere. I love going there even though I'm not even the biggest beer fan. Great poutine as well. Only downside is that sometimes it's hard to find a place."}
{"text":"There's a really cool garden terrasse in the back with wooden banquets for a convivial chat under the sun. Santé! It feels so nice and relaxed that you just want to stay and try the next beer. I had a reasonably priced pint of house beer at $6 tax included. I noticed after visiting that there's a great beer selector on their website. For food, I had the carbonnade de bison: not the most tender nor the largest portion but it was very flavourful and mildly spiced - definitely wiped the sauce clean with my fries. Multiple servers passed from time to time to take care of all tables on the terrasse. I'm looking forward for a repeat."}
{"text":"Vraiment une belle sélection de bières. Le menu bouffe est assez cool aussi, on a pas mangé, mais ça semblait assez prometteur (et local!) On a bu de la sangria sur la terasse, c'était sympathique. Ma seule critique est qu'on y est allé en après-midi et qu'il manquait un peu d'ambiance... Une petite musique de fond aurait fait l'affaire :)"}
{"text":"Vices et Versa was almost full to the last table around 8pm on a Tuesday night, testament to the fact that Montrealers like beer - craft beer. The place had a great atmosphere: cavernous, dark wood panels, dim lighting, and not too noisy considering how hopping it was.   My friend and I are both fans of a less hoppy wheat beer, which doesn't seem to be very popular at the moment. I picked out #5, Wit L'Argousier, at the same moment our waitress pointed it out as one of their only wheat beers. Reminiscent of Hoegaarten, this light, carbonated, and citrusy beer was a wheat beer lover's dream.  Knowing we'd be going out to dinner soon (where surely a bottle of wine was to follow), I choose to slowly nurse my Wit L'Argousier, but after draining his, my friend, thinking it would be similar to his last glass, ordered #19, the Hopfen Dunkeweizen. Although it had notes of pumpkin and cinnamon, it was super-hoppy, so not to my liking. Of course I'd like to see more of a draft wheat selection, but I can't expect Vices and Versa to cater to the few over the majority, now can I?"}
{"text":"As visitors to Montreal, we were looking for a place nearby our Airbnb to just relax and have a drink or two after a long day of being total tourists. Vices et Versa was just the thing, even though the drink menu is a bit overwhelming and the whole place a bit loud. Our bartender, Benoit, was as attentive as could be with a big crowd, our drinks did the trick, and the poutine was wonderful.   At the end of our visit, Benoit asked what was next for us and when we answered ice cream, he immediately stopped what he was doing to ask a coworker what she though was the best place around. The gelato she recommended was stunning. Overall a very friendly and helpful bar."}
{"text":"Great selection of local brews, decent food (miss the real salmon burger) and a pub/beer garden feeling to it."}
{"text":"Total 5 star beer selection and service from Lauren (and the whole staff)! Loved the poutine with beer gravy. Vices & Versa was the only stop we made twice during our 4 days in Montreal - we made sure to make a second visit before leaving town. On our first visit, Lauren gave us some really awesome recommendations for the next day.   Don't know if/when we'll be back in Montreal (we were in town for a wedding), but V&V is definitely on our can't-miss list."}
{"text":"We pass by this area for sth else on a Sunday afternoon and keep noticing this place because it's  unusually busy/crowded. Since we are in the mood for a quick bite we decided to check it out and WOW this place is amazing! We took the beer discovery taster and all 6 of them are surprisingly good with their unique characters. Pulled pork taco is another highlight of our day. So delicious! Now we understand why this place is so popular and wonder why we didn't find it sooner."}
{"text":"Went here for a drink on a Saturday night with some friends. I had a vodka cranberry which tasted fine...kinda hard to mess that one up.  We ordered the chocolate cake, but it tasted more like a spice cake with brown food colouring. Not what I was expecting nor wanting. I ate two bites only cause my first bite was a shock and made me wonder what I was actually eating.   They had 32 selections of beer. I don't drink beer, but from what my friends said the beer seemed too watered down. You can get a tray with 6 flavours to try...out of the 6 my friends tried, they liked the one with \"Dubai\" in the name the best.  The beer with ginger apparently had a very strong ginger taste, which is great if you like ginger.  They have a water cooler where you can serve yourself, which I liked because I always drink water when drinking.    The atmosphere was fine, nothing really special about the place. Service was pretty good, more so at the beginning, then it seemed not so great. The waitress came and one person ordered a drink and she didn't ask anyone else at our table if they wanted anything, which they did. A few minutes later my friend got up, went over to her while she was busy chit chatting with a coworker, and asked for a  drink. She went away right away so you would think she was going to get the beer...but it never came. We had to call her over and remind her."}
{"text":"We stopped here twice during a week-long stay in Montreal, once because we purposely sought it out and again because it was convenient to where we were. The only food we ever tried was the roasted rosemary nuts, which were super small but sort of a perfect energizer to keep us moving and only like $2.50 or something.  The beer line-up is superb, and well-worth seeking out for that alone. Incredible and diverse selection. This was a winter visit so I can't speak to the outside space, but the front half of the place is drenched in sunlight if you time it right and a great place to warm up with on a cold day.  The service was probably close to the slowest of all the places we visited in Montreal, but certainly friendly which was really all that mattered. We would have likely ordered food on our second visit, but could tell we would be there for quite a while trying to accomplish that so just decided to have our delicious beverages and keep on moving.  I would just keep in mind this is a relaxing, friendly place and as long as you're not in a big hurry, it's pretty wonderful."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! This is really one of my favorite bars in Montreal. Frites are actually really good but, of course, the real focus is on the diverse & extensive beer selection. Good music, outdoor space is fantastic to hang out in (weather permitting) and always a great crowd. It can be dangerous when dealing with the 8-12% alcohol beer range and a cozy seat. It's laid back but far from lazy!"}
{"text":"Service was slow to arrive but ok once we got going. Certainly a great selection of beers. Nice patio. Food was tasty but portions were somewhat meager. Food was somewhat overpriced for what was on offer. I'll say again, nice patio. Didn't see any music while we were there so I can't speak to that."}
{"text":"If this place was closer to home, I imagine it would become a regular hang-out! It has a very chill feel, unlike some of the other places we visited for beer this particular evening. It is not very large, so it may be hard to find a place at peak times. We got one of the last tables around 9 PM on a Friday, but there were still a few places at the bar.  The beer menu is ridiculous! So many good choices. One drawback of having so many beers is a lack of space for being able to describe them. And because they have so many, it seems they rely on chalkboard rather than printed menus (which makes sense).  We opted for the flight to be able to try 6 different beers. We may not have made the best choices, some were just ok. I especially liked the Saison Brett from Les 3 Mousquetaires.  We didn't have food, but the menu included some traditional bar food (burgers, poutine) as well as some small bites (nuts, olives, pickles). I will have to come back to try some food and the patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"L'atmosphère de la place est super, l'endroit est plutôt spacieux et la terrasse l'été est juste wow. Il faut s'y prendre d'avance par contre pour celle-ci ou bien s'attendre à faire la file pour une petite place puisque c'est toujours super bondé de gens et c'est vraiment vivant surtout quand le beau temps arrive. On a cependant pas de difficulté à se trouver une table à l'intérieur!  Je n'aime malheureusement pas la bière (en général!) alors je ne peut commenter sur celles-ci, par contre on m'a dit qu'ils en servaient de la bonne! Étant gaspésienne, j'ai même aperçu qu'ils offrent parfois la Naufrageur qui provient de Carleton-sur-Mer, dans mon petit coin de pays.  Le menu est bien mais lorsque j'y vais, je prend plutôt un verre de vin en bonne compagnie et je mange souvent ailleurs (ou chez moi!)  Ça vaut le détour pour un apéro de fin de journée après une longue semaine de travail."}
{"text":"Après le Lunch Break du midi j'ai enchaîné avec le 5 à 7 Patio Season dans la même journée.   La place propose une grande variété de bières de plusieurs microbrasserie.  Pour ma part le service a été rapide car je suis arrivé avant que la grosse vague de client arrive.   J'ai eu une fringale après ma première bière j'ai donc commandé un cornet de frite avec une mayo à la \"Guiness\". Les frites étaient parfaites chaudes croustillantes salées juste comme il faut, la mayonnaise ben la Guiness on ne la sens pas vraiment j'ai trouvé ça dommage.  Pour le bruit, comme le dit Hugo, dès que la vague de client arrive, et bien on ne s'entend plus donc après 17h si vous cherchez le calme ce n'est pas l'endroit. Mais pour l'après-midi si vous voulez sirotez votre bière sur la terrasse à l'arrière vous pouvez y aller tranquillement."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers from a variety of micro-breweries. We've been there several time and tried different ones (the menu also changes regularly so do go back!). The atmosphere is very laid-back, though the place is often very busy. And the food absolutely amazing! My only negative point would be the staff who are sometimes pushy and arrogant (no need to be, you'll get your tip don't worry!)"}
{"text":"Started coming here as an alternative to DDC especially when we were in big groups. Ultimately the place won me over, slightly pricier when it comes to beer, but with great value for food and a good menu for a place like this (nachos and fries are great, when washed down with excellent beer, they're better). A cozy place to spend an evening with a great terrace out back for seasons that aren't winter. Does fill up occasionally, but spacious enough that people will leave if you hang out in here long enough to find a table. Excellent bar to chill with friends!"}

{"text":"Très agréable moment passé dans ce bar très accueillant! Nous avons testé le carrousel de bières et de très bonnes frites. Incontournable pour les amateurs de bières (près de 40 bières différentes) et de sourire!"}
{"text":"Awesome local beer selection, good nibbles, outdoor seating in the back. Basically perfect. Take a (fairly long) stroll to Snacks'n'Blues afterwards for the late night DJ. That's where the music magic happens!  Tip: Play a lil' game with your friends where you order by number. Tell your friends the number beforehand so they can tell you if it's something you DEFINITELY won't like. We did that and it led to some interesting tastings..."}
{"text":"Holy beer selection, batman.  I had five of them.  All different.  Most waiter's choice.  My favorite, I think, was the Irish Red.  But they were ALL GOOD.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.  There are two distinct indoor spaces and a very lovely and comfortable patio... OH... I mean...terrasse.  I added a quick tip stating the waiters \"ate hit.\"  Um.  Yeah.  I had many beers.  That should have been \"are hot,\" just FYI.. all of the waiters are hot.  Even before I was dizzy with beer happies.  Also we had poutine.  Oh the poutine.  This was exceptional.  The fries were great.  The gravy was great.  This poutine was all win.  If this place wasn't six hours from my house, I'd be here twice a week, easy."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a beer and snack. We sat outside on the back deck. Nice beer list. Our waitress helped us with our selections. The nachos were delicious. Glad we went."}
{"text":"Of all the places I'd been in Montreal so far, this was the most modern, upscale and hipster. They did frites and beer very well. I love being able to get a glass of beer (as opposed to a pint) anywhere in the city, but hate the information design of the menus! Brewery first, then beer name, dammit!   That said, the waitstaff was very friendly, quick and pleasant. I thought the selection here was less enamoring than Le Saint Bock, but still very nice to see a solid focus on the regional beers, if some prominent members were missing, in my opinion.  A comfortable atmosphere, a good selection with appropriate serving temperature and glassware, paired with great frites and mayo made for an extremely pleasant early evening!"}
{"text":"Très vaste choix de bière et de bouffe. Les serveur sont toujours sympas et le bar est quand même vaste. Je recommande"}
{"text":"Amateurs de bonnes bières, vous allez ca-po-ter. C'est le genre de place où l'on peut faire sa fine bouche côté bière, et demander au barman ou à la barmaid de nous aider à faire un choix selon nos goûts. Ils n'hésitent pas à nous verser quelques gorgées pour nous faire goûter, pour qu'on soit absolument satisfait de notre choix.   Et satisfaite, je le suis à chaque fois! J'essaie de varier un peu les bières que je prends là-bas (et en plus la sélection change constamment), mais je dois avouer que je finis souvent par retomber sur ma bonne vieille IPA de Dunham ou du Trou du Diable. Et si vous êtes un amateur de cidre, je vous conseille fortement la CID Rosé. Miam.  L'ambiance à l'intérieur est assez décontract', dans un décor vraiment de base. Leur terrasse, par contre, mérite vraiment le détour! On se sent comme dans un petit cocon de verdure, bien confortable avec notre délicieuse bière.   Bref, le Vices, c'est un must si vous habitez dans le coin de la Petite Italie, ou même si vous n'y habitez pas! En tout cas moi, j'en ai fait ma cour arrière. Santé!"}
{"text":"Great fries, amazing lamb burger and a great beer list, though a few of my first choices were sold out.  The waitress was very friendly and tried hard to explain the menu in English, very service oriented. Definitely worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Grand choix de bières: très intéressants. Poutine...nonnnnn...les frites sont réchauffées de la veille...sauce plus qu'ordinaire. Rien pour assouvir une envi!   On y va pour prendre un verre pas pour manger, dommage!"}
{"text":"A group of about 14 of us came here for our last night in Montreal.  I actually met up with the group as they were moving from inside to outside, which was necessary.  It was pretty warm inside.  Anyway, we sat at a long communal table and had round after round after round.  Our waitress (whose name was Lauren, which made me love her) was awesome and refilled our drinks just before we needed to ask her too, which was perfect.   We were an obnoxious group of Americans, all wearing tank tops, and we enjoyed the hell out of ourselves. The atmosphere was great, as was the booze.  Oh! I ordered a bison poutine.  Out of this world.  I devoured it.  We spent quite a few hours were just wasting the night away.  And we'd gladly do it again."}
{"text":"Very good beer selection.  Low key atmosphere with a patio for some nice conversation surrounding beer.  Flights are available and prices are reasonable for the amount of options.  This place is definitely a beer bar and beer bar only.  It was open late and was quite full considering the 1:30am timing I arrived.  I would be back for the selection, especially just for a hanging around type of evening."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome selection of beer. One of my main stops when I visit Montreal although its pretty popular and can get pretty packed! A sign of quality if anything."}
{"text":"Okay, I might get quite a bit of flack from giving this place a less than average review, but I have my reasons. I was really excited to try this place and have heard GREAT things about their craft beer and pub grub, and given my \"will travel for good food\" motto, of course I was going to visit it sooner or later. My first impression of Vices et Versa was that it was very cozy and rustic and had so much potential; it would have been a great place to bring friends and catch up over the week's happenings. I got the beer sampler of six different types of beer with a pulled pork poutine. I loved the beer sampler as I thought it really showcased the uniqueness of each one, and there were a few of them that almost tasted like wine but with that carbonated edge, which was surprisingly great!  So where did it all go wrong?  Well, what ended up happening was that I almost waited an hour for the poutine, and when I brought it up to the waitress she said she didn't remember me ordering it, and I explained that I ordered it with a different waitress. She went to the back to check it out, and about five minutes later, they messed up my order and gave me a regular poutine instead. I was quite irritated at this but I ate it anyway since I was in a rush and didn't want to wait any longer. The poutine itself was one of the better ones I've had in Montréal, but it still doesn't change the fact that at a seemingly unbusy time, the service was still slow and incompetent for such a simple order. The organization was bizarrely executed in a weird manner, and the only reason why I'm not giving less than 3 stars is because at least they didn't charge me for the price of the pulled pork poutine. Will I be back? Maybe, but I'd like the service to be more prompt and accurate, and I'm almost never one to complain about that specific criteria."}
{"text":"Paradis de la bière, rien de moins. Groupes bienvenus et âmes solitaires assises au bar également bienvenues. Je ne manque jamais d'y faire une saucette quand je suis dans le coin.  Quantité impressionnante de bières en fût de brasseurs québécois. La sélection de bières en bouteilles est également interessante et variée.   Bon service, staff sympa qui prend le temps de jaser avec les clients quand il y a un petit lousse, de la place en masse. La bouffe est bien aussi. Parfois un peu cher, selon la bière choisie (toujours 7,25$ la pinte pour l'instant).   La Vigno approved, tout est pardonné!  PS: la terrasse est vraiment chouette!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  I love this place to death!  Wide open spaces inside, great garden area outside, and just a fantastic selection of beers.  I just couldn't imagine a better place to be do some day drinking with the cool afternoon breeze and a nice Quebec brew in tow.  I would come back here forever.  The service is also great.  Free Wifi.  Beer is cheap and so delicious.  They just have a lot to offer for both light and heavy drinkers.  Whether you like the hoppiness, fruitiness, or just some darkness, they have what you want.  Sorry, they have what you need!  Their menu looked solid, but I didn't have the chance to try the fare.  Will have to next time which I hope is soon."}
{"text":"Ah, Vices et Versa! Tu parles d'un beau gastropub. La liste des bières locales et importées est la meilleure et plus complète en ville et leur menu de pub est vraiment bien pour un endroit qui ne spécialise pas au niveau restauration. Comme tout bon gastropub, ils ont des sandwichs, burgers, frites, poutines, etc. Le service peut parfois être lent, mais c'est seulement le cas lorsque le bar est rempli, ce qui est assez normal... amirght?   Mais sérieux, le staff s'y connaît bien au niveau de la classification et des caractéristiques de leur sélection de bières et sont super sympathiques lorsqu'on pose des questions. Et, petit conseil d'ami : prenez conscience de la liste des bières en fût disponibles avant de poser la question de \"qu'est-ce que vous avez en fût?\" à votre serveur... La liste est vraiment longue et ce n'est pas la question la plus constructive. À la place, demandez dont de savoir qu'est-ce qu'ils ont dans une catégorie spécifique - genre IPA, lambique, ESB, cidres, etc. Ça va vous éviter de partir sur le mauvais pied ;)  Finalement, en été, on y va aussi pour la terrasse arrière. Elle est toute belle, avec des belles plantes et des petites vignes. Ça fit bien dans le quartier et c'est un endroit parfait en une soirée chaude d'été avec une bonne 'tite frette à la main! Santé!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few while in town for the jazz fest.  Kindof an incomplete grade for me: 32 craft beers from local Quebec brewers, but I loved the rosee d'hibiscus beer so much while at Dieu du Ciel that that's all I drank here. Did not get food, but did sit out on the back patio, which was pleasant and relaxing (trees shielded the light rain nicely). Service was friendly and attentive.  Would like to go back to check out some other Quebec microbrews."}

You will also find fast foods in the menu,  poutines,  burgers fries etc... and they are descent. . Not sure if would return for the food,  but i will for the beer."}
{"text":"Je suis venu ici pour fêter mon anniversaire, il est possible de réserver et donc de pouvoir amener un grand groupe d'amis :)  Nous étions à l'intérieur mais il existe une superbe terrasse qui est vraiment super belle ! Le choix de bières est imposant et limite trop important car on ne sait pas vers quoi se tourner, il vaut donc mieux demander conseil à la personne qui sert ! Le service de notre serveuse principale était HORRIBLE, aucun sourire, elle pousse les gens sur son passage. Un scandale cette fille ... Le reste était de bonne facture que cela soit de la nourriture ou de la bière donc je pense revenir en espérant clairement ne pas tomber sur elle ... La musique est tout à fait raisonnable en terme de décibel donc il est possible de parler et de s'entendre convenablement et c'est un bon bon point.  Un endroit donc à tester sur le boulevard saint laurent que je recommande."}
{"text":"A friend asked me to meet up for a drink on a late Monday evening and suggested this venue. It was really warm out, so I was glad we could grab a spot in the back terrace since it was packed! Thankfully we only had to wait 15 minutes before a table cleared out. Besides the bartender, there was not another soul indoors though. There doesn't seem to be any A/C inside so it was stiflingly hot!   The service was great, friendly staff and prompt. I'm not a beer drinker but judging from the wide assortment of ales and stouts on the drink list, I'm sure anyone could find their perfect pour, except me..haha! I'm a hard liquor and wine kinda girl, so was so happy to see the L'Orpailleur wines available as our only choice, either red or white.   As for the venue, it was nice to seat in the breeze and be able to converse with no loud music blasting in the background. The patio is comfortable albeit the wood chairs.   In all, anyone who likes a good brew and a laid back spot to catch up with friends, this venue does it! The reason I gave it four stars is mostly because the drink selection is very limited, and the tables were a little sticky and could use a good wipe down."}
{"text":"Damn it.  Damn it, Vices et Versa!  Sorry, sorry...it's not you.  You, as a bar, were cool.  Extensive and varied beer list, solid musical selections, relaxed atmosphere.  Sadly, the girl who waited on us--and I use the word 'wait' oh-so-lightly here--was not.  My dude and I were in town for a much-needed vacation and had a short but sacred list of beer spots that we wanted to hit up.  After a long, slushy walk from the metro, we finally arrived at Vices et Versa.  Yessss.  Let's drink and be merry!  Well, we did drink so there's that.  But our server...man.  She was...something.  Everything we did--order, ask a question about a beer, speak, breathe, etc.--seemed to annoy her.  I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that she was having a bad day but she seemed to be on point with the other tables.  Every time she passed by our table, she'd suddenly act like the song playing was her jam and would look in the opposite direction as she karaoke'd. Interesting avoidance tactic to say the least, one that I might have given her props for had my husband and I not had to bear the brunt of her awfulness.  Eventually, she gave up on us altogether and two other (much happier) servers came around to our table to check on us.  At this point, the visit was a bust so we quickly finished our beers and left.  Bummer.  We left disappointed but eventually found our happy place at Dieu du Ciel later that night.  So yeah.  A star for the beer.  A star for the two nice servers.  And, I don't know...maybe some mood-lifting tea for our server-turned-songstress?"}

{"text":"What a fun place! The beer selection is pretty grand, I should have imbibed in those rather than my vodka sodas which were actually pretty good. They muddled the citrus  in the glass and it made almost like a boozy orangina but with lemon yummmm.  Also, it seems that you have to be absolutely hot to work here. Every time I ordered drinks, looking into those blue eyes made me freaking forget what it was that I was here for derrrr.  I enjoyed how accommodating they were when paying, you could easily get cash back if paying with a card. Why can't we do this here?!  And lastly, the poutine we got here was probably one of the best that I've had during my short stay in Montreal.  Je t'adore, MTL!"}
{"text":"I can't have enough of this cheeseburger. It's amazing. The beer selection is also very interesting.  I had two and they were good.  Good place to either hangout with friends or satisfy an urge for a great burger."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time tasting the local craft beer from Montreal and pulled pork poutine at the bar.   A local suggested I visit this bar instead of heading over to Dieu Di Ciel for a better beer tasting experience in Montreal because they have more varieties from different breweries.  Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Vendredi après--midi. 3 heures. Il fait soleil, mais c'est un peu frisquet. Je ne connais pas l'endroit, mais j'entre. J'ai rendez--vous. La place n'est pas vide, à ma grande surprise.

J'ai essayé une bière IPA de Jukebox. Belle amertume en bouche et très rafraîchissante.  On parle, le temps passe. Je n'ai pas essayé le menu, mais il semble alléchant! Plateaux de fromages, de pâtés ou de charcuterie à partager, burger, frites, côtes levées, miam miam!  Il est déjà 5 heures, la place est maintenant pleine à craquer! Je quitte, mais je reviendrai sûrement avec des amis cet été pour essayer la terrasse à l'arrière! Le parfait endroit pour les amateurs de bières et de produits locaux!"}
{"text":"Quick pitstop on a very long walking day.  Big outside patio with uncomfortable chairs and banquettes.  Inside just ordinary.  A pint of cider and some red sour beer for Pablo and we were on our way.  Not worth a special trip out there.  Service good...but everywhere in Montreal the service is good"}
{"text":"Great beer bar with a nice backyard beer garden and long list of local beers.  The food (pub fare) looked amazing, although we didn't have the chance to order any. If you ask, they have beer samplers available to taste a variety of brews without getting too bombed. Service was cheerful and warm, and the neighborhood is chic. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Everything has been delicious and well-priced. Beer selection is very impressive. The backyard patio is peaceful and charming."}

{"text":"This is a great place. I love going here for drinks or for nachos. In the summer there's also an awesome outdoor area. Really cool vibe. Whenever Im in the area, this place is always on my radar.  My only complaint is that on a couple of occasions, I have experienced two separate, rude, francophone servers (pretending not to understand my french, when most of Montreal does or at least appreciates the effort, except these types) who were only nice once my francophone speaking friends arrived. But.. still won't keep me away though. Nice place. :)"}
{"text":"Love the relaxed vibe and the attentive service. Tried their ginger kombucha and was in love! Their nachos were decent but if i'm back its really for the drinks.   The best part was their music - their tracks were perfection. You want to shazam the whole thing to make a personal playlist.   Go! Drink and be merry!"}
{"text":"Am I a pub? Am I a restaurant? Am I big? Am I small? Vices et Versa doesn't know! And neither do I. I went there with a group on a Monday and it was way chill, the waiters are on the ball, and I got to try plenty of their stuff: their poutine is super boozy, a must if you want to include more beer to you food ;) The nachos are very good, but the gems are on their blackboard.  Speaking of, check out their 40+ selection of beers, there really is something for everyone, but if no one agrees, you have the amazing option of ordering a \"platter\" or 6 small glasses of different beers!  I was so into it that I dragged my date along a Friday night. It was less chill - the place, which is surprisingly roomy - was jam-packed. We didn't so much get a table as two chairs at the end of a large group table so we were right in the middle of a group of 3's conversation. Neither our spot nor the conversation impressed us. But it's convivial, the people at the end of the row flagged our waitress when my meal was ready because everyone hears it all so why pretend? Frankly they could easily remove 5 tables and make it possible for you to walk to your table without clawing your way out. I made the mistake of ordering the calamari without realizing it was as expensive as a main dish, don't do that, but come by when it's nice and quiet for sure."}
{"text":"\"Go there and dip your french fries in mayonnaise.\"   Extensive beer and some pickup basketball right next to the bar."}
{"text":"Choix de bières au fût incroyable, super ambiance"}
{"text":"A great local neighborhood bar. Yes, it's pretty packed on a Friday evening, but it's no different than any major city where people just want to enjoy the start to the weekend.  They had so many kinds of beer, so if that's what you like, you should come check it out. My friend and I found a spot at the bar. She ordered a pint of iced cider (rose), which was good but a little dry for my taste, and I had a kir Breton (creme di cassis with cider), which I loved! It tasted like an amped up apple cider and you could not taste the alcohol (it hit me later).  They offered pub fare (poutine, burger), but we had just come from dinner. Next time, I'll try out the food."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots for beer in Montreal. An ever changing menu (picked from the best local breweries), good food, and a great atmosphere make this place a sure-bet for a good time.  The beer menu is usually around 30-40 beers, and written on a blackboard (it changes daily). With beers from MTL, Dieu Du Ciel, and other big local names, you just can't go wrong. There's always a few strange/fruity ones on there, as well as a cider or two, so there's guaranteed to be something for everyone. You can also get smaller 'taster' sized glasses, which is great for trying a large number of beers (and still being able to walk)  The back patio section is now open, but I haven't had a chance to try it myself. The place itself is alongside a public park, which gives it a look of plenty of space out the back."}
{"text":"This brew pub was great. There were 35 different beers to pick from and I landed on a scotch ale that was aged in Chianti barrels--yes it was as good as it sounded. Our party of five split an order of pulled pork poutine which was heavenly. We only stayed for one beer since this was our 4th stop on a non-official brew pub tour. I would definitely go out of your way to stop in here and if you are in the neighborhood do your self a favor and camp out for a little while."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. Good prices and local beer. Really nice terrace with heating lamps for winter. I was happy they offered veggie options. I had the veggie burger and my husband had the cheeseburger with poutine. The gravy is homemade with beer and he said it was delicious. I loved my plate too. Great for a chill date. Or just to hang out. Love the art work too."}
{"text":"I was invited for a birthday party to this place. And wow, I was definitely surprised by this rustic place filled with people, music and laughter. On each Tuesday night (during winter), the place features live quebec  music, accompanied with lots of traditional dancing. I was lucky enough to attend the last one for the season :) They also have a huge collection of well crafted beers. Awesome place to hang around with friends!"}
{"text":"J'y retourne un peu plus souvent. C'est le bar voté par RateBeer comme une des meilleures destinations de Bières à Montréal et c'est absolument vrai. J'ai commencé à y aller il y a 10 ans et cet endroit a beaucoup changé et en grande partie parce qu'ils sont beau bon pas cher. Ils ont une grande place et une terrasse qui est vraiment superbe. Il y a aussi le niveau des bières qui à changé. Ma première Baltic Porter de LTM et Samedi passé, la brasserie invitée Unfiltered Brewery de Halifax est passé avec des bières incroyables. Ils ont un Brassin Impératrice a 16-20$ la bouteille qu'on peut l'avoir au verre pour 6.75$. En Février, ils célébrait leur 12ieme anniversaire avec une liste de bière complètement folles, donc des Kegs de Hill Farmstead du Vermont, courroné meilleurs brasserie en Amérique du Nord par Ratebeer.   Bref, c'est un lieu de contemplation pour les amateurs de bières qui n'ont pas 9-20$ pour se payé des bouteilles, pour les essayeux de bières locales avec des options en bouteille plus luxueuse et rare pour les fanatiques prêts à mettre 40$ sur une bière d'éditions Limités.   Pour les old schooler comme moi qui y allait quand c'était un bar émergeant de quartier dans un monde de micro-brasserie aussi émergeant, on est déçu d'attendre pour s'asseoir tellement le bar est plein tous les jours. Le staff est aussi en grande partie des artistes qui ont ce job depuis toujours et on finit par être des habitués et confortable de voir nos barman/barmaid nous servir notre dose houblonnée du jour."}
{"text":"After being on my to visit list for a long time I finally made it to Vices and Versa.  It has got to be my new favourite terrasse in Montreal.  It is small, cozy and in general a great place to unwind with a drink.  Be warned though that everyone else has the same idea as it gets very crowded.  My friend and I were lucky to get the last free table on the terrasse.  They have a massive beer selection so you're best off getting the tasting option which is $15 and gets you six beers to taste.  you get a pretty sizeable glass of each beer so you definitely get your money's worth.  My personal favourite was the ginger beer and it is a perfect fit for a summer day.  There is also a food menu here. I went for the pulled pork poutine and it was so close to being a 5 star poutine.  I thought the peppercorn in the beer sauce added a nice touch and the fries were awesome.  The cheese curds though weren't squeaky enough for my liking.  The pulled pork was moist and juicy though.  In all I loved my first visit to Vices and Versa and wished I lived closer so I could come here more often.  The terrasse is awesome, the beer selection is fantastic and the food is tasty.  This place is definitely a must try if you're in Little Italy."}

{"text":"One of my favourite bars in montreal, outstanding selection, great staff, awesome beer, great little beer garden and the revelation that is pulled pork poutine!! I really cannot find any fault, go there!"}
{"text":"Pub assez l'fun! Je suis allée à cet endroit pour prendre un verre et souper avec des amis hier (vendredi) et j'ai bien aimé l'endroit! Évidemment, c'est le genre de place qui déborde de gens un vendredi soir. Étant arrivés assez tôt (19h), nous avons eu une place assise, mais rapidement l'endroit s'est rempli et il y avait beaucoup d'action. Le gros point fort de l'endroit est définitivement leur excellente sélection de bières. Il y en a vraiment pour tous les goûts, et il y a beaucoup de choix. On peut y faire de très belles découvertes. Niveau bouffe, j'ai pris le burger végétalien. J'ai été plutôt déçue de mon plat. Le burger était correct, mais sans plus. Pas vraiment de garnitures. Les frites étaient très ordinaires, je ne les ai pas mangées. Je donne tout de même un 4 étoiles à l'endroit puisque sa vocation est clairement la bière et non la bouffe!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place to go for drinks with friends or colleagues. They have a small sunny terrace which does gets busy especially on a warm summer day.  I love their pink cider! I'm a huge cider fan and I had to order another one and another one, it's just so good!"}
{"text":"The artisan craft beers of Quebec are second to known and Vices et Versa features only those kinds of brews on tap as well as bottles. The selection is enormous but a real chronicle of beer making in the Province. You can sit inside or outside on the back terrasse which is quite nice weather permitting. V V is a perfect spot to get acquainted with the beers of Quebec."}
{"text":"Mardi 27 août 2013  À l'occasion du rendez-vous Patio Season, on y découvre un petit bar-bistro sur St-Laurent qui semble, à première vue, intéressant et typique. On y offre une très large gamme de bière et autres alcools divers. Toutefois, lorsque le service commence, c'est là que l'expérience prend une tournure moins intéressante.  Première commande lancée : une bon rosée de l'Orpailleur. Délicieux et froid juste à point. La fringale me prend. Je décide de commander les frites dont tout le monde parle. Malheureusement, avec la lenteur du service pour un bistrot pas si occupée que ça une fois que tous les verres sont servis, une humidité avoisinant les 70 %, le cornet de frites est resté sur le comptoir pendant 15-20 minutes. Ce qui a pour effet de ramollir et refroidir la frite la rendant complètement pâteuse et indésirable. C'est effectivement ce qui s'est produit. Un cornet de frites molles et température pièce. On vous sert une mayonnaise supposée être assaisonnée à la Guiness. Je cherche encore la Guiness dans la mayonnaise. La règle de la frite est universelle et simple à suivre : une frite servie par une telle température doit être OBLIGATOIREMENT servie dans les 5 minutes de sortie de la cuisine sinon c'est peine perdue. La croûte n'a plus aucun croquant et le sel a fondu dans la pâte restante. Même un bon cidre n'a pas aidé. Le service étant si lent, j'ai dû le rappeler à la serveuse que les frites étaient toujours sur le comptoir, j'aurais pu me lever et aller les prendre moi-même !  Si vous désirez avoir une bonne conversation oubliez l'endroit. En l'espace de quelques minutes, avec l'arrivée d'une clientèle importante, il devient impossible de s'entendre ou de comprendre la conversation. On lit sur les lèvres !  Thuesday august 27th 2013  While going for Patio Season rendez-vous, I discovered a small bistro-bar on St-Laurent looking like a typical and interesting place. A large choice of beer is available and fiew alcoholic drinks. Unfortunately, it's when the service starts that everything comes falling down.  First order : a nice and chill Orpailleur Rosé. Perfectly chilled for a hot and humid day. Snack time is around the corner. I decide to order everybody's pick : fries. Unfortunately, with the humidity I don't have to explain to you what was the end result. The arrival of the fries took 15-20 minutes. They stayed on the counter under 70 % humidity. What a waste of good food. The end result was smooshy and cold fries, not worthy of eating but still. Served with a mayo supposed to be mixed with Guiness. I'm still looking for the Guiness. The rules for fries are universal and simple : no fries are served in more than 5 minutes wait from the kitchen under high humidity, it's an OBLIGATION in the \"fries chemistry\". The crust is worthless if it becomes humid and the temprature drops down to useless levels if it takes too long. Even a good cider didn't help anything. I even had to remind the fries order to the waitress, I could have gone myself at the counter to get my fries !  If you want to meet and have a good conversation, forget about it. As soon as the place gets crowded, it's done. The noise gets so high, you're left on reading lips."}
{"text":"If I can go to one place and one place only for the night to have a sample of what Montreal local microbreweries offers, Vices et Versa would be my choice!  The 33 beers on drafts have a selections of different breweries and styles.  Love the flight options as we ended up trying 12 beers that evening and I can see my Yelp friend's eyes getting blurry: Can't see the chalkboard symptom and almost walked into the son the sidewalk wall.  We sampled @ $14 for 6 samples with any combination:  La Ruine-Papilles British Rousse Rustre Boson de Higs - A strange smokey beer that has a hint of meat?! Blanche de l'Ermitage Dominus Vobiscum Double - Belgian Dubble 8% Le Tracteur Du Pere Buteux - Saison at 8% MacKroken Flower -10% ABV CID Original CID Rose CID Culvre Sur Lie -10% ABV  La Buteuse - A Belgina Tripel 10% ABV  We were happily drinking and waiting for my other Yelp friend who has problem finding this place...    Now I realized all these high ABV beers we drank at this bar stop would have made me so happy and want to go back to Vices et Versa!  Cheers!!  FYI: I untapped all the beers we tried! I doubt I would have remembered what I drank the next day anyway!"}
{"text":"Un patio unique au cur de la petite Italie! Parfait pour s évader le temps d un kir breton #vivemabretagne ! Ce délicieux bar offre aussi une carte très appétissante, si la faim vous gagne !"}
{"text":"Looking for a sweet little gastropub that serves up beautiful bar food (yes, vegan options) til the wee hours... This is \"just the place\" as Yelp likes to say.  I write this review with visions of that gorgeous vegan burger dancing in my head. No, I stupidly didn't order it, but someone in my group did. The portion is enormous. All I could think about was how divine it would be to get that plate when tipsy and hungry past the witching hour. Sadly, the evening I was there, this was not to be. I stupidly only had a glass of wine. I dig the rustic atmosphere and the friendly vibe. It's the perfect place to come with a small group of friends.   I am determined to return on my next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Good beers..awesome selection of 32 on tap.  Two sours, which were great.  Smoked meat poutine was mouth-wateringly delicious.    I sat at the bar and the young lady who served me was delightful.  Friendly, knowledgeable and efficient.  I'd like to pick up this place and move it to Queens."}
{"text":"Beertopia, I love this place. The fries are so tasty and cooked just right, the back patio is fa-reaking adorable and the beer selection (30+ beers! Changes daily) kicks ass. I've been here a few times after work and I can't say enough positives about this place from the vibe, the selection, the snacks and the prices. It's a hoppy little gem tucked away amid the Italian haunts."}
{"text":"came for a quick poutine dinner stop with a large group. the menu is less than inspiring so i didnt order any entrees. it was my first time having poutine and it was nothing more than a slop of gravy and cheese on top of fries. it's what i expected poutine to taste, although i did hear that poutine should have steak gravy /shavings (which wasnt the case here). we seemed like the only ones there on a saturday night.."}
{"text":"Bière & bouffe - superbe sélection de bières, que je n'avais jamais vues d'ailleurs. Option carrousel de dégustation très intéressante avec un plateau de fromages très généreux qui s'agence très bien avec les bières.   Service - très agréable! À notre arrivée, le serveur s'est approché et s'est agenouillé pour se mettre à notre niveau (gentille attention de sa part) pour nous parler. Ne connaissant pas les bières proposées, nous avons laissé la carte blanche à notre serveur. Sans regret !   Ambiance - aux allures d'un bistro-pub, le décor est chaleureux. Beaucoup de bois, lumière tamisée, et une musique d'ambiance créent une belle ambiance."}
{"text":"The current duke of Vices et Versa, Risa D, suggested we hang out here for a snack and some suds. As a beer fan I was excited to try some local brews. The great thing is that you can't go wrong with selection because all of their many taps are pouring local libations. They constantly rotate which make's all the more fun too! Although I wasn't really hungry, Risa insisted on Poutine as I imagine every Canadian does everywhere they go. It was my first poutine in Canada and it set the bar high. I could definitely see eating this a few times a week now."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible beer list, one of the best I have seen at any bar in terms of rarity and selection.   It was packed everytime we went there and id imagine the food is very good so ill leave my 5th star for the next time I return and give it a try.   If you like beer and especially rare belgians, you should be here."}
{"text":"Pulled. Pork. Poutine.  Someone back in the kitchen could be curing cancer, but I'm glad their brilliance is focused on food, because this shit is actually one of the best ideas ever. With a touch more of the tangy BBQ sauce, it might even be the best food of all time, but I think at this point it's going to have to settle for being just ONE of the tastiest treats I've ever tasted.  The crazy thing about Vices et Versa is that even if they didn't have pulled pork poutine on the menu it would still be an incredible bar, first and foremost because they have beers for DAYS. There are 33 on the tap list (that apparently rotates pretty frequently), and they are all locally brewed and judging by the four or five I was able to taste, all delicious. I guess I'm not well-versed enough in Quebec microbreweries to recall all of them, but I did have one brew called the Peche Mortal (mortal sin) that was dangerously tasty.   And there was some kind of fiddle party going on in the back room.  I'm moving to Montreal."}
{"text":"Beer lover's paradise!  They had 34 beers on tap, including 2 cask selections. Place was jammed, but we were able to get a table (with a little help from the waitress). Fantastic beer selection that rivals some of our favorite bars in NYC.  Great vibe - you feel like you are among locals of all different ages. Food looked & smelled good, though we didn't stray from the liquid course...  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This gastropub was highly recommended by a local and it did not disappoint. Friendly and attentive staff, outdoor seating here friends and family were lounging and enjoying the casual atmosphere, and an amazing selection of beer (I think there were almost 30 beers on the list). We enjoyed the beautiful weather while each sampling 6 beers (for $15). They had a wide mix of IPAs, sours, and seasonal beers. The burgers looked great as well."}
