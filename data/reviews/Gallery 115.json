{"text":"This is a quaint spot and the food is incredible.  Our favorites were their house blend coffee, strawberry cake, and tomato basil soup."}
{"text":"It's really cool here. Great building with lots of history. I had their pumpkin soup and potatoes when we went during the Madison crazy thing. The soup was delicious, needed a tad of salt, but yummy just the same.  The potatoes were actually really good too. There was lady they talk to us about the building and her little trinkets for sale inside the store. She was super sweet.   The gentle to that brought our food was great too. Very attentive and willing to help us 4 ladies out."}
{"text":"We were so surprised by the charm and variety in this space. Gallery 115 hosts an amazing range of beautiful artwork and merchandise, most of which features paintings and frescos of Madison and the Ohio River. It also has a fantastic cafe with a wide range of offerings for any time of day.  The coffee and drinks are fantastic, with a wide range of styles of coffee as well as seasonal drinks like hot chocolate and cider. There's also a number of delicious baked goods, like the old Hoosier favorite, sugar cream pie. And you've got savory options -- we went with the classic grilled cheese and tomato soup, which always hits the spot on a winter day.  The place is an excellent gathering spot for book clubs, meetups, or just a weekday lunch, and the staff is attentive and friendly, genuinely excited about all of the fares and wares they offer. If nothing else, stop in and check out the art and pick up a pack of greeting cards printed with the Broadway Fountain. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time to grab some coffee. The barista Anne was so nice and helpful! I was a little indecisive about the type of iced coffee to get and she was very patient and answered all my questions.  I ended up hanging out in the gallery to catch up on emails. The staff kept busy but never made me feel rushed to leave. This place was very conducive to catching up with friends or getting some work done. Love it!"}
{"text":"Exploring Madison, IN for the first time today. Gallery 115 is a perfect spot for lunch!! Service was attentive and they were happy to answer all my questions about the menu selections. We tried the pot pie, broccoli cauliflower salad, pumpkin soup, chicken salad and pretzel salad. Everything was so delish!! I think everyone should try both the pumpkin soup and the pretzel salad! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Two words:  Pretzel salad.  Gallery 115 was by far my favorite restaurant in Madison.  Both times we were there we ordered hot browns sans tomatoes.  The first time I opted to get the pretzel salad.  It was candied pretzels on top of a blissful cream cheese blend.  Sooooo good.  I was disappointed, however, that when we came back in they had run out of pretzel salad.  I then had the coleslaw which was rich, creamy, and a little sweet.  That is just the way I like it.  Our hot browns were delicious.  The cheese (mornay?) sauce was perfectly rich.  The bacon atop was nice and crispy.  It was just the perfect size.  I also opted to try a slice of their fresh strawberry cake.  Let me tell you that it was the real deal.  You got a whole serving of real fruit in a slice of that cake.  It was the BEST strawberry cake I have ever had.  The icing, I didn't care as much for, but I'm not an icing person.  The staff here is some of the best I've encountered in a long time.  They check on you often and go out of their way to make sure you're enjoying your experience here.  They are super friendly and actually act like they enjoy their jobs.  That is a rarity these days.   Go here!"}
{"text":"A must for lunch if you're visiting Madison. The egg salad sandwich is one of my favorites and the quiche is delicious. Peggy and her staff make the best desserts in Madison so save room. Interesting atmosphere with the art gallery and a fun selection of home items too."}
{"text":"This is one of the local businesses that makes Downtown Madison as charming as it is. Gallery 115 is a coffee shop/bistro/art gallery in the main part of the business, but upstairs is this amazing apartment that they rent out. My husband and I stumbled upon them during a visit to Madison and made reservations with them last year for Valentine's Day weekend. We arrived and the owners immediately greeted us to check us in and show us around the gallery and the upstairs apartment. The apartment was absolutely beautiful- Way too big for just a couple, but I don't necessarily count that as a negative thing (it just means I can't wait to return for a girls' weekend, too!). The living room and master bedroom had open windows all along the front of the rooms. The bathroom had a large jacuzzi tub for two people. There was a queen bed in the master bedroom, and two more twin beds in the other room. In addition to the living room there was also a separate dining room. The whole apartment was warm, comfortable, and homey. We even had homemade heart-shaped cookies waiting for us upon our arrival. You could tell it was cleaned well by the staff. Gallery 115 made our stay in Madison the best it could have been and we can't wait to return!   As if I didn't say enough about our stay, we also had the privilege of walking downstairs to have coffee and check out the gallery. The coffee was delicious and the art was beautiful. I just can't say enough good things about this place!"}
