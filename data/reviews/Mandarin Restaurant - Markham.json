{"text":"The all you can eat buffet for 2 adults and 2 kids cost us less than $80. The food was fresh and the service was terrific. Totally stuffed. One of the better Mandarin locations."}
{"text":"Mandarin buffet offers a variety of tasty options from sushi to crab legs and steak.  The food is always hot and your water glass is never empty.  The service is great and the atmosphere is exactly what you are looking for!"}
{"text":"I wanted to leave a review after visiting Mandarin Markham because I was completely amazed at the service I received by all the staff. Wow, I have never been so impressed or better treated anywhere before. The hostess and servers were so friendly, knowledgeable, thorough and consistent from beginning to end. They introduced themselves and gave us an entire speech while they gave us a tour and explained the menu. It was scripted I know but Mandarin really goes beyond amazing to provide an unbelievable experience for their guests. It was actually the same quality of service as I received at Disney World. They really care about customer experience. Their staff are so disciplined it is so hard to have an entire team be so consistent on a daily basis.   The food was good but I was a little disappointed by the lack of selection. I really wanted mussels in the lunch buffet. There were not many items in the buffet compared to other locations but everything they had was good. Dessert and ice cream selection was amazing. I will be coming back just so I can be treated like royalty again. Great job Mandarin."}
{"text":"Don't bother to go on a Wednesday night.  We were a party of 6 celebrating a birthday.   I was so looking forward to the roast beef bone, I could taste it on my way there.  I stop by the carving station and the carver tells me they will be available when they finish the roasts that they had in front of them.   Even the manager Hubert did not care.  There were 4 shrimps on ice that were not replaced until we started dessert.  Tonight the restaurant ran on bare bones (pun intended).  There are too many good restaurants in the area that this one can be eliminated from future gatherings.  Perhaps try Dragon Legends, Syphon or Maison du Japan."}
{"text":"This buffet is a little pricey but worth it. The food is sometimes hit or miss, but they have a large variety of eclectic buffet items ranging from traditional chinese to prime rib and lobster bisque. The main attraction here though, was the dessert bar where you could browse the many self serve ice creams, mini cakes and cookies. The service is very good and everyone speaks fluent english. If you come, try the sushi bar, it has an interesting mixture of sushi rolls."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER THIS FOOD TO GO! I have never gone in for the buffet. I ordered the shrimp fried rice and vegetable spring rolls. I figured, you can't go wrong with that. It's stir fried vegetables with rice and shrimp. Boy was I wrong!  1) The food was burned ... It tastes and smells burnt. So not the part they gave to me but the food definitely burned in the pot 2) The only vegetable in it is bamboo shoots.  3) It is tasteless  I just wasted $35 on this food and I am a student! I was hoping to put some of it in the fridge and eat it over the next couple of days. But I have decided my body is not trash. I am tossing everything and going out to subway. I'lld rather eat subway than this crap posing as chinese food  Stay the hell away from them!"}
{"text":"Great selection of food!! Not my fave Mandarin [my heart totally belongs to the Box Grove one], but I love the fruit selection, along with the ice cream options!"}
{"text":"The food is not replaced until 20-30mins after being nothing on the hot plate. Disappointed that some dishes were falling into other dishes. The only good thing about this mandarin is their waffle and ice cream that are at the very least: edible."}
{"text":"Me and my family normally come here for my birthday or any type of special occasion, such as New Years or thanksgiving. The food is always good, and my little sister really likes the cotton candy there. There is a nice variety of seafood and sushi there, and it has become one of my favourite spots to eat lunch or dinner at."}
{"text":"PRIME RIB...loved it for an AYCE.  Service was excellent and food was good.  Salmon was nice and juicy.  Did i mention PRIME RIB!!!"}
{"text":"If you whould like to enjoy more of your favorite chinese food dishes for a much more affordable price then ordering take-out, then I suggest heading out to the Mandarin for lunch or dinner.  Aside of changing up the dishes once in a while, it's basically the same as it was the last time I ate there.  Friendly staff always there to take away your dirty plates so you have room to put the rest of your dirty plates.  One of the better places to go for bigger family groups."}
{"text":"BIG fan of Mandarin. So big, in fact that I believe of the last 5 birthdays I've had, 4 were held at Mandarin.  Why do I like it so much? A number of reasons:  - Great food: fresh - Friendly staff - Nice decor - Great variety - if you want to eat healthy, you can do that. If you want a \"cheat meal\", you can do that as well  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"I can't wait to return... the day when they bring back crab legs.  Without the legs, there is no magic!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Lots of selection as expected. But I must say i was not impressed when they brought me hot hand towels to clean my hands before the meal and they stunk! They ended up making my hands smell and i had to go wash them before I ate."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's because I've become accustomed to crappy dirty buffets but I was surprised at how good this place was!  The variety included 4 types of soups, crab legs, spicy chicken, and the usual buffet type food. The dessert spread was just as good.   Service was great considering how busy it was. My only complaint was they had tha air conditioning on way too cold considering it was an already cool night. We had to wait about 40 mins for a table butnit was well worth it. Quality and cleanliness was on the up side.   If you're ever in the markham area, definately make the trip down and enjoy if you're in the mood for Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"We were starving and went for the buffett. The service was excellent, the food was great, and good amount of variety. The only downside was its kinda expensive at $18 each. I dont know if thats the normal price.  Would I go back again to this mandarin ? Yes but not anytime soon. My wallet is getting thin."}
{"text":"Well, believe it or not folks I have never....EVER been to the Mandarin before....for their all you can eat crab legs that is!  Haaaa see what I did there, you thought I was going to say the other thing, but seriously, If you're reading this review and you've ACTUALLY never been to The Mandarin OR any Mandarin for that matter, I suggest you stop reading here, jump in your car/bike/public transportation and go eat at one of their locations....  Ok are you back? So while the MSG/food coma over takes you, your eyes get heavy and you groan like so many of us \"why the F%^& did I eat so much!!!\" Fear not friend this feeling will soon pass (in about 20-30 min) and while it does listen to me recap the joys of the one special I truly fell in love with - Crab Legs!  Brief recap, Mandarin is consistently decent white chinese food. It's never great BUT like going to a McDonalds, you always know what you're gonna get, you always know what to expect and every so often the mention of this place will lead you to craving...  The all you can eat crab legs was well worth the $25.99, especially on the side of all the other food this place offers. The crab is perfectly cooked and even pre cracked for you to obtain easy access to the succulent meat within. BUT what's better than these giant steamed legs is pouring yourself a big ole bowl of melted butter to dip the meant in.  I'm pretty sure that I ate more than my $26 worth in crab legs....technically if you think about how much you get at say the Keg for $35, you really only need to fill your plate up with crab legs alone once......I filled my plate up 3 times....plus had other food....and soup.....annnnnd ice cream.  .....hey hey hey now, no judgement, I exercised that day ha ha ha.  Crab legs come and go but mandarin will always remain the same :)"}
{"text":"We were here for a usual family gathering and it served the purpose. I've been here quite a few times and nothing has really changed. They have renovated recently so it appears a bit larger, both the building and interior, lighting is nice! As for the food it's all the same. Staff is courteous and helpful plus always there when you need a new plate, drink or question answered. Price is reasonable for an all you can eat buffet. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had not been to Mandarin in several years, but I told a work colleague I would take him out for lunch and he wanted to hit up Mandarin, so we went. We arrived at 12:40pm and the place was absolutely PACKED, it's somewhat of a miracle we got seated 2m from the buffet table.   Overall the food is not horrendous like I remembered it to be, but it's not great. There are some dishes that taste good, and some that taste awful, so it's a game of hit or miss. As a texture whore I am always satisfied with beef fried rice noodles, probably my favourite dish at the 'Rin. Aside from that the Szechuan chicken tasted good, although it tasted more like a rendition of General Tso. Torpedo shrimps hit my plate a couple times, they are breaded and tasty (with hot/chili sauce) with a nice crunch. For soups they had available the 4 classic asian soups: Hot & sour, chicken corn, wonton and egg drop. I did want to try one of the soups but never got around to it, if I ever go back a bowl of soup will be slayed firstly as the egg drop smelled and looked solid.   I looove sushi, but I didn't even try one piece from their sushi bar. After eating at Tomo Sushi | http://is.gd/4UeMa | I can't eat a.y.c.e. sush anymore, especially not the miniscule low-average quality grade fish there. I know... I am now a sushi snob. However, I was pleased to see that they did have little cute sushi bowls with a soy sauce compartment.   The desert bar is just how you would remember it, tons of fresh fruit, a couple puddings, a few cakes and Jello (no sugar added)! The ice cream bar has at least 15 flavours with the usual peanut, rainbow sprinkles, caramel and chocolate etc toppings.   All in all I did not have a terrible meal at Mandarin, but who knows when I'll be back there again. I'm also not concerned of this review having any negative impact on their business, that place at lunch time is a zoo."}
{"text":"I've been to many of these chain of restaurants and this is by far the best when it comes to service and food quality. The owners here do something right and usually walk around in weekends. I never have to ask for napkins or refills."}
{"text":"Good bang for your buck. Had a pretty good variety and food was pretty fresh. Only 2 of the many dishes I tried were not good. Waiters were very polite and prompt with refills and table clearing. They had quite a large selection in the dessert section with was very nice. The waffels were espessialy nive. Very crispy and fluffy."}
{"text":"Good crab legs. It's similar but a step above Imperial Buffet's crab legs, but it's also more expensive than Imperial (also imperial has coupons which makes it much cheaper).  Other food were typical. Roast beef were okay. Bacon wrapped tenderloin was decent. Sashimi and sushi were typical buffet quality, which means they were unremarkable.  The soup variety was okay. I sort of prefer imperial's lobster bisque (which mandarin didn't have). Other varieties were similar.  Service was also similar but a step above imperial.  I miss their lobster thermidor. I probably wouldn't come back again unless they have the lobster thermidor. For me, that's one of the only things that justifies the expensive price compared to Imperial.  Quality: 7.5/10, Service: 8/10, Value: 5.5/10. Overall 7/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"Eat-Eat-Eaaaat  till your belly full and your bowels weak.  I dont think I even need to review mandarin. Like who hasnt been to mandarin??"}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday for lunch at 12pm, it was very busy and almost half of their hot food trays were empty. I can understand that it was busy, but they left those trays empty for a while, maybe for 20 min or even more. By the time I saw some of my favorite dishes, I was already full."}
{"text":"Very busy on weekend nights! But all the staff are very friendly and polite. I don't know if all buffets are expected to have good and bad food, but at Mandarin you will find some delicious dishes(spicy chicken, fruit tarts) and some not so good dishes (honey garlic ribs). I was also surprised to see so many empty tables when we were seated after 40min wait, since there's probably 30 people waiting. So they really need to work on seating people more efficiently!"}
{"text":"What can I write about an AYCE place? It has a ton of food selection, tons of drinks and tons of desserts. There wasn't a lot of interaction with the staff because they only came by to take our plates and refill water. They did, however, give us hot towels when we were seated and before we left (nice touch).  Going up to the serving area and seeing all the food was a blast. I haven't been to a buffet like this in a long time. The selection of food was great, tons of asian/asian inspired foods. I also liked that they have a meat station for the prime ribs to be cut. The issues I have with this place is that it's really dark inside and the food was very greasy (no surprise?). Perhaps they need a renovation soon, to make it a little more modern. Also, the lighting would help with the overall feel of the location. I don't recall other locations being this dark. The grease was also an issue with me. Almost every dish was either fried or laced with oil. The veggie dishes were major grease disasters but I had no choice but to eat it. I'm not fond of getting salads at buffets because I don't know how fresh it would be since it's out in the open. I certainly don't mind buffets or this location, they just have to change up the decor and lighting. As for the grease, I highly doubt that'll change.. if you're going to eat at a buffet, you'll be eating your money's worth or MORE, so that extra grease shouldn't bother you! :)"}
{"text":"Here for the holiday brunch with big group. Food and service are good today. They're fully booked but still did an awesome job. Pretty good value for $20pp. Seniors get discount and kids 5-12 years old cost $10. I would give this 5* if chinese tea was free. So full! Didn't even make it to all stations and had to miss 3 stations so I can sample all my favorites. They also have holiday drinks +/- alcohol. Really festive ambiance and they're offering turkey and ham on the bone. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have been a mandarin fan for years until the last 6 years.  Authentic Chinese dishes have been thrown out the window replaced with north American Chinese food.  I have no idea why some of their chain restaurants wear Hawaiian shirts at a Chinese restaurant.  If I wanted Hawaiian dishes I would have gone to a Hawaiian restaurant.  Why is there always a shortage of crab legs?  I come in paying full price to have crab legs and there is none available.   Should I not get a discount?  There is something seriously wrong with their storage of seafood.  Why are the flavours not thorough in the fish or shrimp I am consuming?  Here is their problem, when you take out shrimp or fish from the fridge I understand there is excess moisture since most seafood is flash frozen nowadays but my god, please drain the metal containers of the thawing water from the seafood! It destroys the meat strand causing the meat to become rubbery and flavorless on the inside when consuming.  They need to learn how to cook, prepare and store seafood properly such as fisherman lobster clubhouse or dragon legend.   Try those restaurants and you will understand what I mean by infused balanced flavours and meat strands of seafood.  I am very disappointed with the direction  mandarin has gone.  Being cheap on quality of food will reduce the numbers of customers greatly."}
{"text":"This is my first visit with relatives and food was great! Really good variety and quality, portions are just fine. Prices not bad at all. We came for lunch."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for a birthday party. Servers were attentive. My water glass never ran out. The staff are so polite and friendly. Probably the nicest servers I've had in a long time.  The food was delicious and there is a huge selection. Something for everyone. I like being able to try many different items. It was great for kids. Pizza & French fries were a hit for them. I am a healthy eater but I did indulge a bit. Try the sweet potato sushi roll. The garlic broccoli was good but I suspect it was slathered in butter. My cousin is a vegetarian and she was happy with the selection.  The prime rib looked good but I was too hungry to wait in line, so I gave into the chicken fingers (which were amazing) & a veggie spring roll. (Feeling guilty now for eating these). The salad bar was nice but the soup didn't interest us. My cousin had the spicy & sour soup. She really didn't like it and said it wasn't spicy at all.  There's sugar free cheesecake. It was good. Lots of fruit too.  I'd go back. It's great for groups."}
{"text":"1 of 2 mandarins in the city of Markham this location had been here for years. It's known for its all toy can eat buffet, crab legs and prime ribs.  The overall atmosphere is nice with various rooms catered to its own design. Most importantly this place is super clean and that's an A+ in my books.   The service was EXTREMELY friendly to a point where I thought our server they were brainwashed like robots like in that movie Stepford Wives haha. ..  The food was about a 3/5, which is what I typically give. The food wasn't anything to be WOW'ed about.  However it was nice to be able to have a mix of chinese, japanese and some western food options such as prime rib.    Overall experience was good..... would I be back...probably not..even if ROB FORD invited me :P"}
{"text":"Just came back from Mandarin at Woodbine in Markham. Our family has been coming for years but sadly to say we will no longer. The quality has gone down tremendously. Not only is  the food terrible but the uncleanliness is disgustingly obvious. The hot towels smelled like mildew. The utensils on the table were not cleaned properly and the floor had all kinds of food droppings. One of the staff missed a couple of fresh wings on the buffet table when he transferred them to the serving dish. He picked it up from the buffet table and put it right into the buffet dish. That's pretty gross. I won't be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I have some memories of going to Mandarin as a kid, my grandparents love this place so I would always come here for their birthdays. I hadn't been here for at LEAST 10 years but...  Recently I was here for my gradnparents' anniversary for lunch and it has somehow stayed the same as I remembered it. Tacky, dated decor like multiple fish tanks and off colour furniture isn't the best ambience for a restaurant.   The Mandarin is a buffet (I've always hated buffets) that has primarily Asian inspired food like spicy chicken, pork and beef. There's also American food like fries and onion rings, Caesar salad. The food was incredibly average, and inconsistent as with all buffets, some items were hotter than others. Mandarin has too much variety, and loses it's theme as an Asian restaurant.  Mandarin has a full dessert bar too but nothing was great there, they had ice cream cotton candy, I'm sure to appeal to kids.   Mandarin has NO draught beer, all beer is in bottles. They have all the same beers a normal bar would have Canadian, Coors etc. The only Asian beer they had was Sapporo. This is pretty surprising, you would think at an Asian restaurant they would have some nice exotic Asian beers on tap. This seems like a missed opportunity. All they had was Sapporo in bottles which I had. It tasted flat to me.  The Mandarin is cheap lunch was $15 a person and even cheaper for seniors who get an additional 20% off (which is why my grandparents love this place so much).  The crowd is typically seniors and families with young children.  There is nothing appealing about Mandarin, with so many better Asian restaurants in the GTA."}
{"text":"Suspected case of food poisoning   we went yesterday night for a family outing and within about an hour my husband got violently ill. I followed a few hours later, the dinner was the only common thing consumed in a few days.   I suspect it was one of the chicken dishes as my husband had quite a bit of it whereas I only had a few pieces which would explain the time discrepancy."}
{"text":"The wifey and I were recently wanting to feast away to great Chinese food as we always had when we were kids.  So we came to Mandarin for just a night out. Haven't been there in 5 years.   Decor has been updated. Looks more Modern. And so has the price. Almost $32 a person. Nuts! The bill nearly came to $70-$80 for 2 people! I'd much rather go to a high end a la carts restaurant and eat a touch less but walk out with happiness.   Service was great. Young/energetic staff. Very prompt and quick to refill and clear plates. The man serving us in the west side room did a great job.   The food was horrible. A lot of the food is pre bought frozen stuff. And the stuff made in house is either undercooked, or dry or just plain nasty. Sushi rolls were odd and poorly done, salad station was just full of iceberg lettuce (super cheap) and a lot of dishes has recycled elements to it. From Spring roll sushi to bone dry pork smothered in sauce. Hygiene isn't quite there either. People itching their eyes and then going back to making sushi. Nasty.   The dessert seems to be brought in. But that is also of low quality. Cheesecake is like wall paper (maybe too much Geletin or some sort of starch [which should not be in cheesecake]), to marshmallows dipped in chocolate(really? Where are the strawberrys?). Even the rice pudding was inedible. Under cooked rice pudding!! Wtf.  And finally the ice cream... Didn't go down well either. Don't think it's made with true dairy, and flavours are so artificial.   I sit here writing this review with my stomach grumbling. Not because I'm hungry but because my stomach is starting to get upset by the food. I'll probably have diarrhea. If I get food poisoning, I'll let you guys know.   Won't ever in my lifetime return to Mandarin. Disgusting.   (Only the crab with garlic butter was good)"}
{"text":"Short version:  I can't believe this place is still in business given that Star Walk buffet is just 6km down the road. The difference in quantity and quality between the two places is absolutely immense.  Long version:  The only \"premium\" foods that Mandarin has that Star Walk does not have are prime rib (low quality) and crab legs. The premium foods that Star Walk has that Mandarin does not have are: sashimi (Mandarin has a sashimi Nazi that will give you a plate with 2-3 on it at a time), lobster, crispy skin roast pig, Peking duck. The reason this comparison is important is that the non-premium foods are insufficient to justify the ~$27 price - if you go to a $27 buffet to just eat fried rice and sweet and sour pork, you're an idiot.  The demographics of the clientele is also very telling. Star Walk has about 95% Asian clientele; Mandarin has about 60% Asian clientele. Why is this difference important? If you walked into a \"Mexican restaurant\" in an area with a huge Mexican population and almost half the clientele are gringos, what would your conclusion be? What if the Mexican restaurant down the street had only 5% gringos?  So unless your sole goal of going to a buffet is to eat as much crab legs as possible, go to the one 10 minutes down the street. You'll thank me for it."}
{"text":"Went with coworkers for lunch. Very good selection to choose from and everything I tried was pretty good, but nothing really stood out that would make me want to go back.."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times with friends and coworkers.  Mandarin is known for its fresh food but small selection compared to other buffets in Toronto area.  This location is definitely just that!  Nice decor, waiters speak fluent english, decent buffet food, great for parties and gatherings.  Recommended for a reputable long time Chinese buffet in Markham area!"}
{"text":"well, food buffet. what do you expect. they will always try to cut corners to make it profitable. but surprisingly this place have a good service.  aside from that, the food it self. hm. skip all the cooked items. you can munch on the salads, fruits and other stuff."}
{"text":"Please reconsider of going to Mandarin unless you want massive diarrhea after, this is the worst buffet I have ever been to in my life, it's not even real chinese food yet alone even edible food, I did not eat half of the food on my plate because honestly it's garbage....they had chocolate covered bacon, like seriously is this CNE or something..,,oh yea and bacon lettuce tomato sushi, WTFFFFF is going on with this place and their made up creations  I can't believe I paid $26 for this...the only thing good about this place is the service but almost all the cooks and servers did not speak English......we asked where the sour cream was and they pointed us to the whip cream......this place gives chinese food a bad rep.   You have been warned don't be fooled by their stupid mandarin commercials!!!!"}
{"text":"Many, many food options, food is often replenished, overall, a lot better than what I remembered it to be! The food area was kept very clean.  Also notable is the service; all of the staff were very polite, friendly and attentive. Our water was constantly refilled and plates were immediately cleared.  I loved that there was a massive dessert selection! From jello to cake to icecream & softserve froyo to cotton candy!"}
{"text":"friendly staff, was what i expected going to mandarin food was good desserts were lacking however"}
{"text":"We all know Mandarin!  So how is this location?  I go to the Boxgrove location (which I've already reviewed) more often and compared that one, this one is just a step lower in all areas.  The food is of slightly less quality, there's a little less selection, the service is a touch worse and it's a little smaller.  One thing I wish they'd consider is the dining rooms.  Last time I went, one of our three tables were on uneven ground so it was slanted the entire time.  And considering this location's always busy, I didn't want to bother asking for another table.  None of these are in the one star category, I should reiterate.  It's all these little things that need slight improvements.  So if I have a choice, I'm choosing the Boxgrove location."}
{"text":"Recently renovated, it now looks nice. Lunch cost me $25 including a drink and tip. Kind of steep if you ask me."}
{"text":"Typical Mandarin. Main reason why I came was for the crab legs. That doesn't seem to disappoint but that as well as the prime rib are what you really pay form sushi is mediocre."}
{"text":"I have Chinese food delivered to my hotel rooms quite often and I'm never surprised.  It's always the same as the last, but not this!  I was very impressed with the food, the delivery, the presentation.  Food was here in well under the hour she quoted.  The woman on the phone who took my order spoke English very well and didn't try to rush me off the phone.  I will definitely order again when I'm in the area."}
