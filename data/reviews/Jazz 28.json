{"text":"Jazz 28. Aqua blue hits your eyes when you first step in. A cozy bar stretches from the entrance to the back of the kitchen on the right side. The restaurant itself is packed with tiny little tables and a small stage in the back for the Jazz musicians to play. 

When we arrived it was ABSOLUTELY EMPTY! Now....this may be a good or a bad thing - it depends on what kind of night you are looking for ;) It had been a Wednesday evening in November and it was pouring rain out. However.... I don't think there's anything better than sitting in an empty room with candles all lit up with a personal live Jazz performance as background music. Well maybe not background music since the singing was a bit loud and overpowered our conversation at times. Were they just vying for our attention? :) After their performances, the musicians/owners (amnesia on names) were friendly enough to chat with us, making it a little less awkward since we were the only 2 in the room - and also letting us know they weren't just going to eavesdrop on our conversation the entire time. Later on in the night, the power went out! Everything went dark - which I think made the restaurant 100 times more romantic because of all the candles....and also wasn't blinded by the hideous blue paint on the walls!

Despite my positive review, I would only give this place 3 stars from a food/drink standpoint but giving it a 4 because of the atmosphere and live Jazz performance :)

Appetizer: Apple pancake w/ Salmon
Entree: Airline Chicken w/ Spinach and Sweet Potato Mash
Drink: Basil Vodka
All yummy.

Overall, a great place to take your date for great Live Jazz (the smoky kind) and special alone-time...."}

{"text":"First off, the location...Housed in the same space previously by Budapest Blue and beloved Halite, it is indeed in an odd location. Surrounded by a residential area and the ominous glow of Lutheran Hospital, it is not the most ideal location for a restaurant.

Stepping into the restaurant, you will notice a lot of blue. As in the bold colored blue walls. The décor is a blend of old-school lounge melded with modern touches and lighting. Service was very gracious and friendly. The space itself is intimate with one small room with jazz performers playing at one end of the room and a bar along the wall of the room.

Went on a Friday night and the restaurant was about half full. Similar type of crowd as at Nighttown. The jazz group, Paul Stranahan Trio was setting up to play at 8:00. Awesome concept, having live jazz Wednesday through Saturday. Sweetness!

Drinks are very affordable. Majority of bottles of wines are in the mid-twenty buck range. Various traditional martinis and mixed drinks offered, as well as own specialty cocktails as well. We got a 25 dollar bottle of Vouvray that was quite nice.

Nice assortment of small plates/appetizers are offered, check out the menu on their website. We were debating getting several small plates a la tapas, as many looked tasty like: peach wedges wrapped with ham and basil, shrimp grapefruit cocktail, gumbo and potato-apple pancakes; but instead opted to go for entrees. The waiter brought us a basket of breads that included a typical baguette style white bread and a tasty nut and raisin bread accompanied by an olive tapenade and sweet butter spread. Both with excellent flavors.

Onto the entrees...the Bell & Evans airline breast chicken was roasted to perfection. Crisp delectable skin covered tender and juicy pieces of breast meat on the inside. One of the most flavorful well-cooked pieces of chicken I have ever had. Mmm-mmm. On the side was roasted, crispy slices of apple wrapped with bacon (must mention again, everything wrapped with bacon makes it better), pureed sweet potatoes (just the right amount of sweetness) and a small pile of sautéed spinach. The juices of the chicken, mixed with the flavor of the bacon and sweetness of the apples created a perfect balance. The salmon fillet was cooked to just the right temperature, not dry and not \"rare\". Excellent flavor with carmelized onions on top and with a side of sweet potatoes and grilled asparagus in lemon butter. Mmm-mmm again.

The portions were just right for the entrees. They had some excellent looking desserts that the waiter displayed for us on a plate. However, we were happily filled and sipping our wine while enjoying the music. We were sitting one table away from the band, and the volume was just right; able to hold a conversation without yelling.

Overall, had a wonderful meal. Only minimal complaint would be the prices. They were slightly a little bit on the high side. Not sure if business is taking a hit, but the prices on the menu for the entrees on the website are not accurate. Currently, the prices for the entrees are two dollars more than advertised. The chicken entrée was $20. The small plates are still the same advertised price online.

Enjoy the tunes and food, keep this place going and perhaps get the prices done. Cheers!"}
