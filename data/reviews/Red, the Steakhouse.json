{"text":"Excellent steak (had 8oz USDA prime) prepared to perfection. Truffle infused mashed potatoes are a must, along with donut bites & dipping sauces. The reason for four starts is compared to other steakhouses I have frequented it is more than a fair assessment. Build a salt room to age your steaks in and we can talk five stars."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Red.  The first visit was truly delicious, one of the best steaks I've ever had.  So in celebration of my retirement, my family took me there.  I was sorely disappointed.  I ordered a strip steak, medium rare.  It came well overdone.  For $50 just for the ala carte steak, you would think they would know how to cook it.  They brought me another one fairly quickly, but it had been rushed and was too rare and had not been given any time to rest.  To make matters worse, the manager was un-gracious in handling the situation.  Since I had to wait for my second steak, I was not able to enjoy my glass of wine with it.  I thought a second glass as compensation for the mishandled entree would be fair.  The manager refused, though not directly -- he made the poor waitress deliver the refusal, and then only after I asked a second time.  So, strike one: over cooked steak, strike two: under cooked steak, strike three: whole thing handled very badly by the management.  At this price point, it should be perfect the first time.  And when things go wrong as they sometimes do, it should be handled graciously.  This was a very unpleasant experience and I will never go back to Red!  Oh, one more thing... as we were leaving a man in the parking lot asked us how our meal was.  I don't know who he was, but he acted like he was with the ownership.  He asked for my name and phone number and promised to call me to see if he could turn our opinion around.  4 days later, no call."}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL!! And the Executive Pastry Chef for the group (with Moxie) is AMAZING! Seriously, the food was outstanding! The best meal I have had in a very long time. I don't necessarily love that everything is ordered a la carte, but that sort of comes with the territory - but at least you get exactly what you want! Flavor of steak was spectacular! I cannot say enough good things. My only wish is that we could afford to go there more often!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, had some issues with getting just what we ordered and the apologies and explanations were short of what I call customer service. We left without eating, first for me. The managers offering to cover the drinks was far from an easy fix. You will never find me there again and I discourage anyone from going!"}
{"text":"I went to Red last night with friends and we had drinks & appetizers at the bar. Not only was the service horrible bit the waitresses were unknowledgeable about the wines! She simply gave me the most expensive Cabernet by the glass! The house salad I ordered was horrible. The presentation was less than great and the lettuce was wilted! I will never ever go back there again!"}
{"text":"Great time at the bar.  The wine was excellent- a Morgan Pinot and both barkeeps were attentive and polished.  I actually was meeting a friend for coffee and the most wonderful powered donuts ever!!! However, in addition to that- we had the shrimp app and I had two glasses of wine.  This is a great place to go for either a full meal or just segments-"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Excellent service.  Swanky atmosphere.  Filet mignon was top notch.  Very expensive."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner and great service. Everyone was so attentive and June was a terrific server. Can't wait to go back. The decor and ambiance was very nice, it was a classic steak house. Btw the steak was really good"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Red and I can safely say I was impressed.....yet left wanting.  The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was great.  The food was quite good but other than the (infamous?) donut holes, we never had that OMG moment.  We both got the 8oz. CAB Filet with tater tots and green bean sides.  While its true that most of the food has a little \"spice\" to it, I wouldn't call it hot.  The steaks were tender, juicy and  perfectly cooked but I've had moments at other establishments where you just have to stop and say \"Holy S%#t, that s good!\" and Red just didn't take me there.  Did I like it, absolutely!  In truth though, I'd be more likely to explore another restaurant before returning for another shot at Red."}
{"text":"Excellent wine selection. Great side dishes, but get them to share as they are very generous portions. Good bread and excellent EVOO dipping mixture. Everything was properly cooked and nicely served. I would have preferred a multiple server strategy, but thye service was still excellent."}
{"text":"Slow service. Tables were too close together. My husband and I could not have a decent conversation. We only heard the people next to us. Ambiance was terrible. I felt like I was eating in a warehouse. Crab cakes were fried beyond belief. I will never go back."}
{"text":"It started with a very reasonable valet ($8) and a welcoming staff. Our table was clean and the waitress (Camille) was great. Gave suggestions where needed, timed our food perfectly, and kept the glasses full. Even brought us the best doughnuts on the planet as a celebratory notion for our anniversary. Would highly recommend this restaurant. Oh and the steak was A-mazing"}
{"text":"Very very very slow service. When the waitress finally got to our table the experience was even worst:(. The food is just ok not bad and not wow! Tuna tartar was really good, steak actually really bad!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by the warm, friendly service and truly delicious food.  Grouper was a special for the evening and was the best I've had, even when in Florida. My husband's Prime filet was perfect. The Mac-n-cheese side dish was great. And the trio of creme brulee dishes light and really flavorful. (Everyone around ordered the doughnut holes - so we'll have to try those next time.) Nice pomegranate martini, too - although pricy at $14.

The only negative was that the server and her assistant forgot to bring the bread to the table - and we had to ask after our salad was served. The wedge salad was good but not great - I'm sure there are better choices.

All in all, a great spot for a special dinner."}
{"text":"Jeez, what is not to like about this place? The menu is extensive, the prices reasonable, the service impeccable and the ambiance very pleasing. I've eaten here several times and will keep coming back. I keep ordering the fillet cause I can't stay away from it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best steak I've ever had. Chris gave us the best service we've had in years. I'm fat and happy! We had a 12 oz filet au poive, the insane delicious corn and steamed spinach. Chris recommended the donuts for dessert. I unbuttoned the top button of my jeans and decided, what the hell. Warm, fluffy balls of heaven dusted in powdered sugar dipped in chocolate, topped off one of the best dining experiences ever. Eat here and ask for Chris. Hot waiter. Sumptuous steak. Martini. Perfect."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed when visiting this resturant, I understand why reservations are needed..,,my last visit was on 05/12/12 and it was awesome....Our waiter Davd L. is the best he made sure to tell us about the specials of the evening; very attentive to what we asked for and even recommended some dishes as well.  The chicken breast, salmon, and stuff lobster thermidor to die for must try.  Our sides were big enough to share with 3 ppl...the spinach, mac & cheese, and green bean fantaboulus..David even recommended drinks I tried the Moon Mountain Wild Raspberry Vodka mmmmm deelish!.....check them out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My family, including my husband, our daughter and son- in- law, and two granddaughters, ages 13 and 10, all  dined at Reds last Friday eve. The restaurant is perfect for foodies of any age! Our, waiter, Mark, was excellent. He took us thru appetizers, wines, explained all the dinners and desserts. Out children were celebrating their anniversary and they were treated to dessert. Every bit of food was delicious!! The wines were delicious. The desserts were awsome. Small chocolate lava cakes were delicate , paired with creamy ice cream. The men enjoyed their steaks and said they were superb. I enjoyed salmon, my daughter shrimp de jong, shrimp cocktail for one of the girls, gourmet Mac and chese for the other. The entire meal was five star and for a more traditional Menu, it's the best steak house I'm town. I believe they recently opened two restaurants in Florida."}
{"text":"The service was terrible- we waited over an hour for 3 dinners and sides. Each of us ordered filets and had no complex orders and were given poor excuses as to why our meals were so late. The food was amazing, however, the excuses were poor and inconsistent. I would recommend the food, however, be wary of the service."}
{"text":"This place is great!! The food is magnificent!! Hands down the best steakhouse in Cleveland!! Don't believe me!!!? Try them.. I've been to most of all the steak houses in Cleveland. Ex. Morton's, Fleming's, John Q's, and eww Outback. Dress nice for your life changing event!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food !!!!!!!! Not cheap ... Slightly stuffy ..... But worth it ..... Service was phenomenal !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've had several people tell me for years that Red was their favorite steakhouse in Cleveland. We finally went with a group of 5, and Red delivered solidly to back up its reputation. They've been open for a while now (10 years?), and it's nice to see a veteran restaurant still deliver perfectly prepared food, as one hopes when ordering. The beef selection is offered in 2 grades: Angus, and \"Prime\". We ordered a selection of both. The \"Prime\" definitely has the additional flavor and texture that the waitress described. I loved it. Others in my family preferred the Angus. Both are wonderful. And they were cooked to perfection, exactly as ordered. Appetizers, salads, and sides were also wonderful. Especially the crab cakes."}
{"text":"Red is good! Nice juice steak and good services"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a party of six for the day after Thanksgiving (November 29, 2013) on October 6, 2013.  We had three people coming over for Thanksgiving from the West Coast and decided to go to Red since we wanted to make it a special occasion. We had not been there for a few years and had a nice time previously.  When Hannah from Red called to confirm the reservation on the 29th I asked to make sure that the our table was away from the door, since it was a cold day.   Hannah said that we were going to be seated at a round table and that she will make sure that it was away from the door. When we arrived on time the round table reserved for us was in direct line from the door and there were no other round table for 6 available. The table that I had assumed was saved for us (furthest away from the door was already taken. ) We were assured that since Red has double doors everything would be fine.  Unfortunately, it turned out that the inside door was left open most of the time and we felt the draft throughout our visit when people went in and out.  Even after we complained to the manager, Nicki, my husband and I had to get up to close the door ourselves. The food was fine (what you would expect at this price point), service perfunctory (we had to ask to refill our glasses with water.) I like to patronize Cleveland Independent restaurants, but would not go back to this one."}
{"text":"Unless you are one of a handful of patrons frequenting this restaurant on a regular basis where you would be considered \"regulars\" by the this establishment,  I believe this would not be the location for a complete dining experience for you.  I have been to this restaurant six or seven times within the past five years and have found the service to be unacceptable on each and every occasion.   The last visit, having gone against my better judgment,  was no different.   I have  sensed  extreme rudeness  from the host/hostess to the waiters to the bar staff.   The food is good not excellent but it is completely overrated.   My wife and I enjoy fine dining and often times find that having a drink or two at the bar of an upscale restaurant along with a few appetizers an enjoyable experience.  We are not novices when it comes to the dining experience since we travel and know what is acceptable and what is not.  This place is definitely a \"not\"!  Spend your money where the dining experience is not limited to okay tasting food with a lot of attitude.   Remember your bill is and should be the collaboration of the food, atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Red has brought sexy back to food.
I hadn't been here in a while, and decided to entertain a client & do dinner last night - he's a newbie to Red, so we went there.
I'd forgotten how nicely subdued and  luxe the ambiance is, mellower than the Moxie side. Made it easy to relax. 
Cyrus, the sommelier is great. We had a lovely full bodied red, the Muga Reserve, a rich Spanish wine. Great! 
Next Artisian cheese plate, always a good warm up with the wine, just tell them what you like & they will put it on the plate for you....
Then the food came  & the look of lust appeared on my guests face...his steak was about to be gone in 60 seconds. I am in love with their sides, so ordered up a bunch : parmesean tots, potatoes au grautin, chop chop salad, and the mac& cheese - so we could drool, and share. 
The steak was incredible; so were the sides. Wine, fabulous. Still really reasonable for being so awesome - about $220 including 2 bottles of wine!
Just an overall wonderful dinner, I had forgotten how outright sensual & elegant Red really is. If you take a date here, I think you can bet on getting ****. Fill in your own blank. If you don't, it's not the food's fault!
XO to you Red!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Saturday night.  Walking in, restaurant and decor are very nice.  Sat at the bar prior to being seated and cocktails and bar staff are top notch.  
After being seated, we ordered appetizers (calamari, steak tartare, and tuna tartare) for the 4 of us.  Presentation, quantity and quality were all excellent.  Everything is off to a great start!
For dinner, obviously you come to Red for steak.  On this night, they offered a 24 ounce bone-in Ribeye as a special.  Two of us ordered the Ribeye.  This was the disappointment of the night.  The steak despite being CAB Prime, was so fatty it was inedible.  There was 12 ounces of fat on my steak.  No joke.  Large clumps of fat like a mediocre cut of prime rib.  After telling our server that this steak was extremely fatty, the response was \"ribeye cuts are known to be fatty.\"  Thanks for the update, but not to this level at $60 a steak. 
My wife's filet mignon, ordered butterfly cut and medium well, came out to the table medium rare.  They took back her steak and finished cooking it.  Messed up the pace of the meal, but sometimes this happens.  All I can say is it must have been a bad day in the kitchen.
Fortunately, the side dishes (brussel sprout, spinach, truffled potatoes, mushrooms) were all outstanding.  
Since this is a special occasion type of restaurant, I put the expectations a little higher.  Sorry to say that as far as the steak goes, this place was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Red is locally owned and is a personal favorite.  It makes for a great after work drink and/ or dinner...and is usually top on my list for corporate or smaller family gatherings.  (They have a \"board room\"  and a couple private dining areas that are appropriate for just about any small affair). 

Pricing is not for the faint of heart, and the portion sizes could also lend themselves to heart trouble.  The food / price value is definitely represented and served up in an atmosphere that is upscale and contemporary. 

Red has always been a see and be seen place since it opened next to its sister restaurant Moxie.  They staff will allow at times ordering off the Moxie menu which has some tricks of its own...like their Steak Tare Tare appetizer....Yum!

There is a large wine selection and knowledgeable staff.
Nightly specials are varied and follow seasonal trends, especially for
local fish, etc.  Steaks are fantastic here and are commensurate with typical expectations for an upscale steakhouse.   Most sides are ala carte and very sharable in family style.  I like this as there seems to be always something new to try....such as a four cheese mac n cheese that was on the menu the other evening.

If they are busy, the sound level pushes up quickly and can be intrusive if you were expecting quiet conversation.  The social element and volume, however, is what makes the place seem like it's jumping all the time.  I recommend reservations and taking advantage of the outside patio, Cleveland weather permitting.  

On my MUST TRY list....Tater Tots...a contemporary remake of standard tot.  This side dish features a mildly-spicy dipping sauce that takes a simple concept and ventures far beyond the basics. For dessert the Doughnut Holes which features three dipping sauces: Caramel, Strawberry, and Chocolate....They are served warm/ hot soft and are among my all time favorite desserts.  You can thank me later!

Enjoy..."}
{"text":"Great steak, salad was very good as well and oooh the molten lava chocolate cake is amazing."}
{"text":"Although I had been to Moxie's several times, I did not know this place existed (it's right next door and has the same owners) until I read about it on YELP.  I had to try it.  I drove around the parking lot twice before I found it; and that was after I then called and they told me it was kind of hidden away and hard to find.   It's a nice restaurant but  way over-priced.  Everything is  a-la-carte.  Each a-la-carte item is pricey (if I remember correctly about $8 for sides), but there's enough for two people.  This means that for example, mushrooms are separate from onions to put on steaks.  (Two sides or $16 just for mushrooms and onions to top off the steaks.)  My steak came back overcooked, but they were very willing to correct it.  The service was excellent.  The cream corn was good, but would have been much better had they left off the bread crumb topping.  Overall, my husband and I decided we would not go back.  While they had the \"white tablecloths\", the ambiance was too noisy and people were spaced too close together to have what we think of as a \"white tablecloth\" atmosphere, especially considering the prices."}
{"text":"I've heard about Red Steakhouse but never have chance to try till my husband's birthday. For this special occasion, we decided to give it a try. 

We didn't make a reservation but we get a table right away. The atmosphere was nice and cozy. Our server was friendly and attentive. The welcome bread was delicious and accompanied by a cheese and olive oil mixture, which was very tasty. We ordered stuffed hot pepper and red house salad for appetizer. They were nice and split salad for us without asking. Red house salad was so impressive, simple but elegant taste, they well blend and balance all the taste nicely. The stuffed hot pepper was filled with Italian sausage and served in tomato sauce. It was a nice surprised since it came with 3 peppers and it was so delicious, spicy hot pepper and tomato sauce, such a perfect combination. 

We ordered NY steak with pepper corn garlic sauce and broccoli. They once again split the meat for us which was very nice. The meat was cooked perfectly, juicy and delicious. We were impressed that all of our dishes were done perfectly.

Since it was my husband's birthday and we mention it to our server ( Thanks to the table near by), so we got a complimentary dessert. It was donuts served with 3 dipping sauces (red raspberry, chocolate and caramel) and it was well cooked. It was one of the best donuts I have had.

We both agree that Red's meal was so terrific and worth the price. This meal was quite a special treat for us, Thanks. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We are \"regulars\" at Red.  It is our favorite restaurant.  We love to eat at the bar and people watch.  The bartenders are friendly and fun.  The food is excellent - we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I really liked it here. Vibe of restaurant is good, waiters are very friendly, food is good!"}
{"text":"First time to the area. I found Red on yelp and it looked good. Glad I did. Food was amazing but service was better. June, our server, was on her game. She knew the menu inside out. I had the NY Strip, CAD medium rare. Cooked perfect. No question it was expensive but worth every penny. A"}
{"text":"one of my favorite place..yayy !!"}
{"text":"We came here with a group of family for a birthday dinner. We arrived at 6:30 and didn't receive our steaks until 9:15. The appetizers were mediocre at best and the salads and soup were downright awful. This restaurant is saved by decent steak even if a \"computer malfunction\" delayed everything by three hours. The ambiance is uninteresting and the noise level is unbelievable. The restaurant was half empty and we couldn't talk to each other. If you really REALLY want a steak I guess you could come here but you could do better. Try Eddie V's."}
{"text":"At first - you'll wonder why a steak joint in a strip mall requires valet parking (when you can simply park 20 ft away for free)..then you realize that for this country clubbing, business travelling, not-so-hard working crowd, image is everything. \"I just waxed my Porsche..let's park in front so Dr. Collins has to admire it\" 

Red Steakhouse caters to this pride..and more.

With an atmosphere taken out of Downtown Manhattan, Las Vegas, or Boston....this place loves people who posture as wealthy (or actually are loaded)..which really bothered me...until I saw the genius. The Beechwood/Myfld Hghts locale is where the money is at. And the locals flock to this place religiously. The staff knows this- and spends a majority of their busy shift chatting up the patrons and catering to their every need. They've all attended the advanced school of serving..face the customer and smile at all times...etc... I spent the night in the bar area chatting with 2 different locals for a few hours after my meal - just because they were so darn friendly.

Of course none of this works if the food is bad....it's terrific! 

Prime cuts are the specialty. I had the Rib Eye (MR) with creamed spinach. It would rival the $70 steak in any premier restaurant that I've ever been in (Boston, KC, Dallas). The menu was pretty extensive...the wine list lengthy (100+ with real top-end stuff) - although a bit short on the \"By Glass\" section.....remember the premise about posturing..\"I really only want two glasses...oh what the hell...give me a $140 bottle of Silver Oak\"

If you can get beyond the crowd with insecurity issues (just imagine them as wealthy versions of the Cheers gang) you may just find this place amusing and downright fun.

It's worth a shot. I suspect that the food will hook you."}
{"text":"Sat at booth in lounge, had reservations for 6pm. Waiter was Dave D.   My family is very laid back average Americans that really enjoy great food, Red stepped up to the plate, was able to read our less-then sophisticated attire and still treated us with respect and THE BEST steak we have ever tasted.  Not to mention, their steak tar-tar was the most amazing appetizer of it's kind since I had it back in Germany.  My only complaint, being beer drinkers (their wine selection, seems top notch, but whom am I to say), their beer selection in rather small, but tolerable.  Will be back, will continue to tell everyone about it"}
{"text":"One of the worst steakhouse experiences I had. Unfortunate because Red in Miami has literally been my favorite steakhouse for years now.

Decided to come here for a solo dinner while I was in town and was feeling a baller dinner was a great way to end my business trip. 

I was super excited as I was expecting to get my usual, rare bone-in ribeye topped with foie gras. That's where I fell into the first step in disappointment, they had no bone-in ribeye nor did they have foie gras. No problem as they still had USDA prime angus ribeye so why not and instead of foie gras I got it oscar style cause why not put king crab on my steak? When I received my steak it looked amazing, steak had a nice sear, king crab looked good, what could go wrong? 

Mouth watering I cut into it, cooked to a nice rare, good start so far. I took my first bite and didn't think too much of it, bit sinewy but maybe it was just that bite. Took another bite and continues being sinewy so I decided to try it with the crab. First bite with crab and I got a mouth full of shell. I had to spit it out and lo and behold there was also barnacle in the crab. The shells, barnacles, and sinew more than ruined the meal for me.  I'm think I was given a crap meal cause I looked like a young'un who doesn't know what he's doing as everyone else seems to have rave reviews. Either way, I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Very expensive but very good!!! The only thing I didn't like was our seating, the tables were VERYYY close together."}
{"text":"FOOD:
The place is pretty pricey, but I went during restaurant week for the 3-course meal and it was one of the best meals I ever had. I was drooling from course to course,. I was expecting smaller portions, but I was really stuffed by the end. They have two grades of steaks the regular and the prime on their usual menu, but the steak they give you for restaurant week was still to die for. It was perfectly cooked, very flavorful and tender. It only makes me wonder what the prime selection taste like and  I'll likely go back to try just that, and their awesome dessert too!

ATMOSPHERE:
It's a nice classy romantic place to go to on special occasions. Our waiter was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"This was our first time, and it won't be our last. An Independent Restaurant GC got us in the door, and we were completely happy with the whole experience. 

Our waitress was wonderful: attentive, upbeat, and informative without hovering. 

The manager came over to make sure that we were having the best dining experience possible. 

The bread service was fabulous: hot out of the oven (baked in-house) & the oil/spices were delicious. 

The steak (14-oz ribeye) which we shared was a best-ever: juicy, flavorful, just the right amount (I'm guessing 4 - 5 oz after de-boning and not eating the fatty part?). We have a new gold standard! 

The creamed corn (a suggestion by many on a FB foodie page) was perfection: we could tell that it had been freshly cut from newly-picked ears of corn. Oh. My. So glad we chose that dish over the green beans (next time). 

And the surprise dessert was just the right touch to end our perfect anniversary dinner. (How many of the 5 couples seated around us were REALLY celebrating their anniversary, I have to wonder?!) 

Red, you are a class act. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is a great date restaurant! I had the Angus Filet with cognac peppercorn sauce and it was to die for. The beef was melt-in-my-mouth tender, cooked to perfection (medium, had a nice outer char with warm deep-pink center), and the creamy sauce was a perfect compliment. We also had the mushrooms (portions of sides are huge, meant to be shared) and truffle potatoes. The server was very attentive even though it was peak Friday night dinner hour. This is an expensive restaurant; if I recall, my steak was over $50, and the sides are separate. But if you don't mind the prices, the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Incredibly satisfying. Sat outside, had great service. Cocktails were outstanding. Bee Keeper cocktail was great as was Basil-Tito's. Prime filet w/ bernaise on the side = prepared to perfection. Potatoes au gratin and broccoli were also delicious. Josh and Maria took great care of us. Someone sent us a dessert which was sweet - yet we had to order the profiteroles. Exceptional. Not enough positive words to tack on here. Can't wait to try the one in Miami."}
{"text":"Went there with girlfriend and mother in law a few weeks ago. We were able to squeeze in a last minute reservation for dinner after my mother in law flew in. Our server was upbeat and friendly, and we were seated quickly. We ate mostly family style, and the chefs accommodated, which is nice. The meat grade was not the best you can get, but it was pretty close. We found the food to be fantastic (get the truffle mashed potatoes!) and the dessert to be sublime (I've been waiting years to try key lime pie, and Red did not disappoint). 

The only downside was the atmosphere - the restaurant felt very crowded, with different tables being close together. The noise level was loud, which made ordering or conversing with family even at our small table difficult, and the lighting was quite dim (normally I don't mind dim lighting as it creates a nice ambiance, not being able to hear and barely able to see one's guests is pushing it). Overall we would like to come again, but next time at a less busy time."}
{"text":"Steaks great. Sides ok. Server was disengaged and absent when needed just long enough to make us look for him while chatting with our guests. We were not in a hurry, but felt abandoned at times. Bathroom just disgusting. Not up to par for a high end steak house. Don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Go here for the food - it was perfect.

Had a gift certificate so went there last night.  Once we found the place (you need to know that it is attached to Moxie because the sign is small and hidden behind a shrub), everything was wonderful.

We had the muscles diablo appetizer, I had the rack of lamb entrée, my husband had a steak.  They brought what looked like hand formed rolls as well and we had the donuts for dessert.  Ordered the risotto and green beans for side dishes.

Rating this restaurant, the 5 stars go to the chef.  Everything was cooked perfectly - I mean really perfectly.  The muscles had just the right kind of heat to them.  My lamb had the exact seasoning and doneness that I wanted.  My husband's steak was their prime cut and it was also cooked just right with a good coating of salt and pepper.  Plates were warmed but not too hot.  Donuts were better than the beignets I have had at Café Du Mond in New Orleans (all they serve is donuts and coffee).  That chocolate sauce was, well, perfect.  Caramel and raspberry sauces had some nice nuances to them.

Service was also very good, our server was Amanda M.  She was super knowledgeable and attentive.

By the way the place was packed and we had the late reservation.

I would do this all over again - highly recommend Red!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner for three on early Friday 12/1. If you are a Cleveland, Ohio area resident and can afford a premium steak dinner you have to eat at Red. Food preparation, and service is consistently top notch. Why go anywhere else for steak?!"}
{"text":"New to the Cleveland region, I was advised that the best steakhouse in the area was Red. I therefore recently took a birthday occasion as an initial opportunity to dine there. As a fan of \"Pittsburged\" (charbroiled) steaks, I was delighted by Red's pictured steak-cooking in that preferred style. Yet, as excellent as that process was at Red, it could not mask what proved to be an inferior cut and quality of steak. Having ordered the $50 bone-on rib-eye (anticipating the very inviting charred bone-on steak so pictured on Red's opening Website page), I was served a steak absent of any such bone -- instead having a large gristle outer-edge and threads of such (tough to cut and chew) extents throughout the meat. When I immediately pointed-out (and demonstrated) such poor meat qualities to the waiter, he simply said that was the only bone-in steak selection that they had that weekday (Tuesday) and next-time I should probably order the \"prime\" rib-eye instead (at $45 -- I was then told that the $50 version that ordered happened to be an Angus \"choice\" cut). After expecting the waiter to offer substituting the inferior $50 steak (and instead watching him slip away ignoring the matter), and to not risk embarrassing my wife by insisting that he replace that steak [something I certainly now regret not doing then], I instead cut/ate my way around the meat gristle begrudgingly. 
So advice wise:  Do not let Red's superior steak-cooking claims mask any inferior qualities served there on occasion (nor any waiter's excuses / avoidances and/or posturing), for your relatively expensive dinning occasion at Red."}
{"text":"Great food experience.  Prime filets were awesome and I could have cut it with a spoon.  The Caesar salad was the best I have had in years.  Green beans as a side dish are killer good.  Wine selection is very good with lots of domestic and import selections at various price points.  Doughnuts were universally liked by everyone at the table but I didn't try them because I was too stuffed from my blue-cheese crusted filet with Bernaise sauce.  Yeah, my pants were tight after that meal.  

Service could be improved...and this includes the girls at the front hostess area.  One of them saw us walk in and she let the door close in front of us.  Um, okay.  Our server was very slow to greet our table. ..we waited probably 15-20 minutes before someone greeted us and took our drink order.  Dinner for 2...$300."}
{"text":"Just not as good as they once were.  Now The Capital Grille is all the rage."}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited a few times over the past few years and always love the experience at Red.  First, I love the secretive feel to the entrance. For some reason it just feels so private and unique, we love it. Once inside, the place is decorated so nicely, very well done.  We always order the filet mignon which is absolutely wonderful!  And I always get the tater tots...yumm!   Great place to go to make the evening really special."}
{"text":"being from Chicago, i'm a steak snob, so when friends suggested Red as the best steak in the world, i was skeptical. In a word-amazing - perfect steak, perfect sides, great staff, and the donuts were to die for. Might make me move to cleveland - but why is it in a strip mall??"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday party in the party room the mango salsa and plantains were tasty starters I ordered the  filet mignon medium rare it was flavoured nicely but later that night I got food poisoning luckily I didn't finish the steak because the texture was funny, it was the Sunday before Valentine's Day so I can only speculate that they had old meat they were trying to get rid of knowing valentines weekend was going to be busy, I stayed up sick for hrs I have had better steak at better prices that never made me sick. Red is supposed to be a great place but I've had way better elsewhere I would rather go to Bluepoint for steak for the price! Reds is all name the food doesn't live up to the prices.
Never going back to Reds it's average and not worth it at all. F-"}
{"text":"The Good: Nice looking and upscale little steakhouse with a full bar and good cocktail skills.
The Bad: 3 quality levels of steaks are offered; confusing and completely unnecessary (see below).
The Ugly: Your dinner bill; thank God this was an expense account meal.

If you're looking for a nice lively bar scene in suburbia, this is a good spot. For my needs, a good steakhouse was what I sought. The ambiance is semi-elegant, no issues. I decided to sit at the bar (there are also a few tables in the bar area) because I was solo and they had a couple wide screens. I tried the CAB Prime Ribeye ($52.00 as I recall), and it was completely underwhelming. Oddly, their variety of steak cuts are offered up in 3 choices: CAB (Certified Angus Beef), CAB Prime, and USDA Prime. I was persuaded to try the top of the line, Prime CAB. I've grilled better tasting and more tender regular USDA Choice Ribeye from Costco on my outdoor Weber. There was little flavor and it wasn't the most tender steak I've ever had, by a long shot. If that really was CAB Prime, I'd call it much ado about nothing.

OK, so the rest of the meal was also average: a $10.00 baked potato loaded was indeed very very large, but not all that great. I looked at their other sides but they were also pricey, in the $10.00-12.00 range, and I knew I'd not be able to eat more than a bite or two. 

My dessert: AMAZING, the best thing I had and I rarely have desserts. It was also unique, to the extent that I'll probably never see it again unless and until I return to Red: a caramel cake in a bowl topped with vanilla ice cream and hot espresso poured over the top. WOW.

I'll go again with the wife so that we can share the meal and get a few sides. I'm fortunate to live in a town (Cincy) loaded up with amazing and nationally acclaimed steakhouses, so I concede I'm hard to impress. However, Red fell far short of the mark. My verdict: good, but not great by any means."}
{"text":"This place is just okay.  For the price, there are SO many other options in the area that it is almost scary.  I have been here two times and both times my steak was a bit chewy which I don't expect for a $30 plus cut of beef.  For the money and a better cut, head to Flemings or Hyde Park.  If you want to be seen paying a lot for your meal, go to Red.  It's just that simple.

This is a place to go to impress people simply because of the prices, not because of the food.  The service both times we went there was average and the valet parking is just weird.  Moxie, Red's sister restaurant, is 50 feet away and doesn't have valet parking.  And the valet service doubles up the cars so it is just a pain.  Park across the way at Sumo because there is never anybody there anyhow and walk the 30 seconds to the restaurant.

I really don't have a whole lot positive to say about this place beside the fact they have a pretty killer wine list, which you will pay through the nose to drink."}
{"text":"One of my favorite steakhouses.  The Beachwood location is preferable.  We always feel fortunate to have such a great restaurant at our fingertips."}
{"text":"Went to the Pepperpike location in May.  Excellent all around.  Dry aged steaks are definitely worth it and the sides were superb.  Next time we are back in the area we will back at Red.  Make sure you get reservations."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday bc we had been wanting a special occasion to try this place out. The steak was great, garlic fries great, calamari out of this world, but did not like the Brussels sprouts. The calamari they give you a good portion, healthy amounts for the sides as well."}
{"text":"I've been to Red a number of times, and the food is consistently good. What makes this restaurant a stand-out is the quality ingredients used. The arugula and prosciutto salad is outstanding. The salad is perfectly dressed, not too much dressing. The prosciutto melts in your mouth, and the parmesan reggiano is perfectly balanced with the arugula. I had the prime filet mignon and it was perfectly cooked (rare) and seasoned. My dad had the chop chop salad, which he loved, mainly because of the  top notch ingredients used. The feta and tomatoes were excellent, and once again the salad was perfectly dressed. He also had the 9 oz. filet, which he ordered medium well, but was cooked more on the medium side. Nevertheless, he thought it was excellent, and had no complaints. The truffle whipped potatoes tasted delicious, but the texture was slightly gluey. We also had the sautéed onions, mushrooms and sautéed spinach. The spinach was watery and dull in flavor, but the mushrooms and onions were tasty. 
The molten chocolate cake was excellent and beautifully plated. Service was very good. The ambiance and decor is relaxing and sophisticated.  All in all worth the hefty bill. Will definitely continue to dine at Red.

{"text":"Absolutely delicious: We started with the crispy calamari and the featured lobster cake- equally delicious with a nice spicy bit to each.  However, the calamari was very typical (breaded, fried, with a creamy sauce).  The side salad was pretty much like any other side salad with the exception of the few house made dressings. The lobster cake wasn't fishy and had the right consistancy.  The main course: the aged filet was delicious- med/rare.  The cut was tender and just melted in your mouth with the right hits of herbs.  The parmesan tater-tots and mix-in-mashed potatoes were positively orgasmic.  The dipping sauce for the tots were slightly spicy ever so slighty.  The creamy, butter consistancy of the mashed potatoes were topped only by the delicious mix ins (horseradish, pesto, etc).  The mix ins were absolutely delciious.  The chocolate lava cake with the white chocolate gelato were to die forr.. I was soo full I couldn't even for 24 hours.  Even the bread brought to the was flakey and warm.  The service was excellent and timely."}
{"text":"Red is one of my favorite steakhouses anywhere.  Wonderful steaks cooked to temperature and outstanding wine list are enough to get you there.  Consistent service and always present management keep me coming back."}
{"text":"This review comprises a summary of my last 2 visits.  

Miyazaki Wagyu.
:)  Grade A5.  Seasoned in a balanced fashion, and fully amazingly mouthwatering.  

Paired with a Grand Cru Red Burgundy, it was a total delight.

***
Had a short chat with head chef after eating Wa-shu beef - Hybrid Angus/Wagyu.  Not impressed.  Would much prefer either the real thing, or stick with USDA Prime.  He agreed.  And was very gracious about it.  Great guy with great presence.

I'm completely glad that Cleveland has an institution that provides Wagyu; maybe not every visit, but often enough that I can get it without traveling.

Red still has my vote for best steakhouse in Cleveland, and the attention to meat quality is superb."}
{"text":"I've been to Red multiple times, but only at the Beachwood location. I'll start off by saying this is the best steakhouse in Cleveland. Their steaks are prime, aged black angus. They cook them perfectly every time. They are Pittsburgh Style, which has a little char on the outside but cooked appropriately inside, without being overlooked at all. They provide a fairly typical steakhouse experience where the service is excellent and the sides are ala-cart. I've tried most sides and they have all been excellent. I can't speak to any of the main dishes other than the steak, because why come to a steakhouse and get anything other than steak. The only downside is the restaurant itself is fairly small. However I believe they are planning a new location which will be larger. The prices are online with this type of food/service."}
{"text":"If my expectations weren't set so high for the \"best steakhouse in cleveland\" maybe I would consider giving it a 5, but right now it sits more at the 4 to 4.5 range.

Interior definitely has an elegant feel, we started with a couple salads and they were pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered the caprese and my boyfriend had the candied walnut/goat cheese. I ordered the ribeye and my boyfriend had the NY strip. I have to admit, both were delicious, but still not far better than what we've had at Flemings or XO. We ended the night with a chocolate lava cake which was presented nicely with a scoop of white chocolate gelato, but once again, not the best that we've had.

So it was a very nice dining experience and everything tasted very good, but I was expecting more so great."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I was invited here for a dinner and a lecture, so I didn't have to pay for dinner.  Lord only knows that I wouldn't have been able to afford it here otherwise.  You can taste how much it is in the food, and that's a compliment!  

Red has small rooms in the back for groups, so 10 of us were gathered for our presentation.  We were started off with 5 Artisian cheeses, the Bleu Cheese was my favorite.  Next out was the bread and House Salad.  Salad had just enough dressing on it and wasn't over kill with the dressing.

For the main course, I had the Double Chicken Breast.  Hot, tender and juicy, perfectly well done.  We had family style mashed potatoes and asparagus, both of which we had left overs of and had boxed to take home.  The mashed potatoes were creamy with butter mixed in and were amazing.

Chocolate molten cake for desert.  Rich and just right.  Like I said,  I couldn't afford this other wise, so if you have the chance to come here, jump at it!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 for a business dinner and this was my first experience with the much vaunted Red.  The service was excellent, the food was a solid 8-9 out of 10 throughout the entire meal which included everything apps through dessert.  The steaks were definitely the highlight and would rival any steak in Manhattan.

The ambiance was very nice but I felt like it looked like a lot of other nice restaurants Ive been in over the years - nothing wrong but came across as being a little austere.

All-in-all great experience."}
{"text":"We're in town to celebrate a graduation from Notre Dame and wanted to take our son to a super special dinner to honor his achievement...being from the LA area, I was convinced we wouldn't find anything as tasty as we could find at home.

Wrong.

This little hidden gem was perfect.  I can go on and on about how wonderful the food was, but the rest of the reviews take care of that...I'd like to add that our waiter was attentive, but not overbearing, made great recommendations and hosted our fun little dessert of hot donut holes (more like a beg-net, but that's what he called 'em.)

Are you from out of town and looking for a lovely evening to celebrate a special occasion?  Call Red.  You don't have to settle for Applebee's, Cheesecake or any of the other 'institutional' chain restaurants that dominate this area.

This will definitely provide a memorable evening."}
{"text":"I came in out of town wanted to eat some good steak on a Sunday Night. Order the 14 oz New York Prime .. Food was good just wish the service was a lot better. Waiter didnt take our drink order until 15 mins after that it took another 15 mins bring the drinks. Waiter never ask to refull any of our drinks until we were about done with dinner . All and all it took 2 and a half hours from the time we got seated until we left  just for dinner. If they are busy i could undersand place wasnt even pack !! For a place with $$$$ vist should have a lot better."}
{"text":"Great steak and lamb! Score 10 or 10 for sure. I am new a Red fan."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. My rating is predicated on the standard gratuity for parties 6 & more of 20%.  Not unusual but we purchased 2 pricey bottles of wine. Normal acceptable gratuity for bottles of wine is 10% -- this was brought to the server's and manager's attention.  The manager pointed to the menus and the website as their standard - really a poor way to justify it.  It should be mentioned upon ordering a bottle if you really want full disclosure. Also writing it at the bottom of the wine list would be more appropriate than at the bottom of the food menu, which had to do with food rather than wine.

Cleveland now has many other choices than Red, which has shown a very poor response to customers' reasonable comments and observations.  I have experienced this same thing when trying to book a corporate event.  Too bad for their inflexibility!"}
{"text":"My medium rare steak was cooked to perfection and the crab was amazing as well. The service was fantastic and at the end we were treated with one of the best desserts that I have ever had: warm donut holes accompanied with a raspberry, caramel, and chocolate sauce. Marvelous."}
{"text":"This place is amazing put quite simply.

We ordered the Prime Rib special to start. It was a 21 wet age and then 21 dry age certified angus prime rib. We ordered this with the green peppercorn sauce and it was phenomenal. Juicy, tender, flavorful and just was an amazing steak!

We also ordered the caesar salad which was a good caesar salad.

We got the Fancy Tater-tots, the Asparagus with Bearnaise sauce, garlic broccoli, and their cream of corn special that night.

The Tater-tots were spectacular! They came with a chipotle-type aioli. these had a lot of flavor, nice and crispy and were just awesome!

The Asparagus was great, the sauce on top was great too.

The garlic broccoli was garlic broccoli, what more can I say.

The cream of corn though! WOW. It was like cream of corn meets corn bread meets corn casserole. It was creamy, had crumbs in it that were good and overall was just amazing!

We also had complimentary bread with a garlic parmesan olive oil dipping sauce which was fantastic.

They also gave us a free order of beignets with raspberry, caramel and chocolate dipping sauces which these were amazing as well. Nice and fluffy with powdered sugar.

The service here was phenomenal. The BEST service I have ever had. Our waitress had our glasses of water full all the time. We would get half-way down and she would stop by and re-fill the glass. Amazing attitude, attentiveness and was just totally on top of everything without being too attentive.

This place was amazing, the atmosphere, service and food was just downright amazing. One of the best steakhouses I've ever been and I'd totally comeback in a heartbeat.

two side notes:

1.) Expect to spend no less than $100 a person

2.) While the steak was phenomenal, I've had steak almost just as good for $20-$25 at Texas Roadhouse, still would go back, but just saying."}
{"text":"The best steak I have ever had. Great decor and atmosphere. Definitely try the cream corn and tots."}
{"text":"This place far above exceeds St. Elmo Steak House in Indianapolis! They aren't even in the same league. As I was flying in from LA to take my parents out to celebrate my Birthday, my Mother's Birthday that recently occurred, and for the Holidays, I happened upon reviews for Red, as I searched the Internet. I'm a Road Warrior Consultant who has eaten at many Michelin star restaurants, but this is a superb dining experience with huge portions! We also highly recommend Jake as a server; the attention to detail was exactly what I desired from the experience. My Father wasn't used to an expensive restaurant, but Jake made him right at home! My Mother enjoyed the experience and the food immensely! We even saw a few sports figures there. Just the evening I wanted after flying in the night previously! Note: People were more formally dressed than what I packed for. On the West Coast, anything goes. The East Coast is a tad more formal."}
{"text":"Great food.  TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!  The waiters (we had 2) were inattentive and slow.  I hadto ask to have my water refilled.  I literally hat to wave both hands above my head to get our waiters' attention at the end of the evening (there were only a handful of other tables at that point) and beg for our check 15 minutes after we finished dessert.  I can't remember the last time I only gave 10% tip.  Usually we tip 20%+.

The bathroom floor was wet and extremely slippery in front of the urinal.  I told the host at the beginning of the night how bad it was. An hour and a half later I went to the bathroom again and it was even worse.  They had placed 2 caution signs up, but now the whole floor was soaked and dangerous.  My wife went to the ladies room and it was the same way.  They were literally holding on to the counter so they wouldn't fall.  This time I told the manager and how I let the host know earlier.  They were lucky nobody fell, because this was clearly gross negligence. I would expect much more from a place of this caliber.

If I had to rate just the food, it would be 5 stars.  If I had to rate just the service it would be 1 star."}
{"text":"Not somewhere for a party of 2 to go unless you want to actually be sitting with the people on either side of you!! My mother and I went here for my 40th birthday and I was super excited to try it. Upon being seated, we realized that we were sitting closer to the people on each side of us than our table mate across from us. That was HUGELY disappointing. 

As far as the food was concerned - meh. We started with the chop salad and all I can say is \"anchovies.\"  It's all you can taste!! Then, I got the CAB Prime filet and my mom got the CAB filet. Neither steak had any flavor to speak of but were cooked prefect to medium rare. We also ordered the au gratin potatoes and brussel sprouts. They were shareable portions and tasted good. We finished with the donuts which were probably the best part of the meal. 

I won't be returning  to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The Kobe strip steak is an experience like none other! Service was great!  You gotta try the donut holes.  Calamari was average but everything else was most excellent!"}
{"text":"First the food. Outstanding, we came with a group of work colleagues and everyone raved about their meals, steak, tuna and chicken and one had the risotto as an entrée. I had a CAB filet and it was cooked to perfection. The sides were excellent although a little on the small side if you're sharing. We had the spinach, yum. The broccoli was tasty too and the risotto was excellent. 
The bread they serve at the beginning is warm and tasty although the mix of seasonings they serve with it and the olive oil was a little different. The waiter wasn't real clear as to what went into it.

The place itself is a little on the small side, much better for a romantic dinner than a business dinner but that's not a biggie for me. We had reservations and were seated immediately on a Thursday night.

The one issue that kept me from giving this place 5 stars was the waiter. At this price point you expect someone very engaged, talkative, knowledgeable etc and although the guy was very functional he did not have much of a personality. I'd almost say he was a little on the awkward side. A small point I know but again when you're paying these types of prices you expect the best. 

If back in the area I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I decided to finally try them during restaurant week because the deals were to great to miss. I ordered steak tartare as an appetizer and had them box the appetizer included with the prix fix menu (which I opted for stuffed peppers which were delicious for lunch the next day). The steak tartare was melt in your mouth delicious. Perfect blend of herbs and spices and very tender!! This was served with petit toasts. Excellent (if you like raw meat)!! For my entree I opted for the alaskan salmon with brussel sprouts with pancetta. The salmon was cooked perfectly. I requested medium and it was the appropriate temperature inside with a crispy skin outside. The fish was very fresh and delicious!! The brussel sprouts were also very tasty, the pancetta added the right bit of saltiness and the brussel sprouts were not over cooked which I enjoyed very much. The best part of the dinner was hands down dessert. I ordered cheesecake which I am in no way a big cheesecake fan. But OMG their cheesecake is so light and fluffy melt in ur mouth deliciousness. The cheesecake is garnished with a large piece of milk chocolate and served with a berry sauce and some accompanying fresh blue and raspberries. The sauce was delicious. Not overly sweet. And the berries were almost infused with the sauce because they were juicy and delicous. The crust of the cheesecake is a barely there extra crunchy cookie type crust. OMG I am drooling just thinking about it. You have to get the cheesecake if you go!!  Overall an excellent meal. They are a bit on the pricey side but definitely worth every penny! Definitely one of the best steak houses in the area!"}
{"text":"SCORE: 4.5
Not a perfect score because it took us 20 minutes to find the place. The door is completely hidden and the lady we called at the front desk didn't provide any helpful tips to finding it. We had to walk though MOXIE restaurant to get there. This was a frustrating beginning to our dinner.

Tip: go where all the hanging lights are, the small door is hidden there.

We were also not offered to take our coats. Lastly, it was a bit crowded and loud, I was hoping not to hear my neighbor's conversation and have a more romantic/intimate setting.

Now to the food. Shrimp appetizer, good. House Salad, delicious!! Large enough to share. The steaks were perfect. We got lobster too, but the steak is the star!

Sides of mushrooms and green beans were perfect! I highly recommend. Service and attention very good! We will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Ordered the CAB prime ribeye, first off the steak was not trimmed properly. There was a large bit of sinew running through the steak. There was also a gratuitous amount of fat around the steak and I know ribeyes are supposed to have extra fat but this was thicker than my thumb and not rendered enough to be palatable. Lastly I ordered my steak rare it was medium rare to medium and if they had cooked it that long they could have at least cooked the fat properly. Other than that sides and apps were good, service was polite and prompt but the steak was extremely disappointing. I had also written an email to the establishment to bring attention to this as I did not want to make a scene at the restaurant but they never replied."}
{"text":"Food was very good but the food took FOREVER to come out.  I'll pass next time.  Obviously not enough to help in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I have been the Red several times with high expectations always. I took my mom for her birthday and she is little old school.  She thinks she can get equal value from some small dive bar steak special.  We started with oysters and muscles she was very happy. She ordered the fish special of the day and  my self the aged steak. My mom walked out of the restaurant with smile on her face from appetizer to dinner she was amazingly happy. Thank you"}
{"text":"I am an executive assistant in San Francisco.  I plan events worldwide, and many of them are executive dinners, off-sites (including a lunch/dinner), and happy hours.

My grandmother went into hospice a week ago today.  My brother and myself felt it a good idea to bring the cousins and siblings together to bid her a last farewell while she was still lucid.  I called Red last Wednesday for assistance with a dinner for 18 people - to be used as a gathering/dinner for all of the family members coming together (all from out of town, except for 3).  Lauren Santosuosso was my initial contact and shared with me that despite the fact that Saturday was Sweetest Day, and the restaurant was booked to capacity, she would find a way to fit our group in.  

Unfortunately, my grandmother passed the day after I spoke to Lauren, and the dinner turned into a memorial service/tribute - as all of the family members were due to arrive on Saturday, and she passed on Thursday.  When planning the menu, Melissa Wright stepped in and continued to work with me to further articulate the details of the dinner, and was pivotal in the planning and orchestration of the final result.

The gathering was spectacular.  Our servers were kind and attentive.  Melissa was a gem to work with, especially considering the haste with which everything was brought together and the attention to detail at such a potentially somber event.  

The food was exceptional.  I would consider the ribeye that I had one of the best steaks of my life.  I will forever be grateful for the care and attention provided by Melissa and her staff.  Red made our very special family event a loving success that will be remembered by all of us forever, as we flash back on my grandmother's life.

Thank you."}
{"text":"I am a regular here despite having a ritual of trying a different restaurant every week.  For starters, places like Hyde Park, Flemings, XO and Johnny's are great places to go; and all share in common prime steaks that are tender and heavily marbled. I visit these places.

That said, Red is my favorite steakhouse in Northeast Ohio. Here are my reasons why it stands apart:

(1) they never, never, ever, get the done-ness wrong. very accurate. never over-done. never under-done. just right and always right.

(2) as with other steakhouses, they char the meat in an 1800deg burner. I've had other places over-char and burn the meat leaving a bitter tasting \"crust\". This will never happen here. 

(3) prime cuts already taste buttery and marbled. The staple of most places is to butter the steak or season in salt and pepper. At Red, they apply an \"aglio\" brushing, that I guess is made from olive oil and italian herbs, which does the job of cutting through or counterbalancing that rich beefy-buttery taste of prime meat.

(4) the decor and ambiance is a refreshing departure from the mahogany panel and old-school design of most steakhouses. This place is hip. Background music is electronica instead of jazz. I love jazz, but I love the change-up for this situation. This is not your father's steakhouse.

What else wins here? The truffled mashed potatoes - very different and somewhat earthy and smoky in flavor. It's an absolute favorite. The risotto -- they will have a different kind featured every week but you can have them customize it for you. The potatoes au gratin are good too. The doughnut holes for dessert -- they remind me of the New Orleans beignets from Cafe du Monde.

I've read other comments about snooty staff, but I did not sense that at all. Our server was down to earth and absolutely friendly."}
{"text":"This independently owned steakhouse is one of the finest in the area. With a wide variety of melt-in-your-mouth steaks complemented by an excellent selection of wonderfully prepared side dishes, appetizers, and desserts, this menu has something to delight every customer. For those who are not interested in steak, they have a variety of chicken, pork, lamb, and seafood, or even some pasta.

But let's be honest, who goes to a steakhouse for pasta? The steaks here are the greatest I have had, and unlike some high end steakhouses, they have no problem cooking a filet well-done, no pink at all, and it was still dripping with delicious juices. At the other end of the spectrum, they can cook a rare steak to absolute perfection as well.

Not only is the food here exquisite from first bite to last, but the service is wonderful. The servers constantly cater to your every need, with unneeded silverware disappearing without you even noticing, and your drinks never running on empty. Get up to go to the bathroom and find your napkin folded perfectly in front of you when you return. They treat you like a king (or queen) without ever feeling overbearing.

Lastly, the atmosphere. As others have mentioned, it does not have the stuffy, country-club feel that most restaurants of this caliber have. Instead, it is youthful and lively, not too loud, but with enough buzz to make you feel comfortable having a romantic dinner for two or a fun gathering with friends, at the bar or in the dining room, it is as comfortable as it is delicious.

Highly recommend as often as you can afford to go. Great for special occasions."}
{"text":"Want a special unforgettable dinner? Go to Red!

The service and food here is 5 Star! 

My absolute favorites are, Brads stuffed hot peppers, C.A.B Prime NY strip with whipped potatoes & asparagus. 

Don't forget the powdered donuts for dessert!!!! They come with 3 sauces to dip them in. Carmel, raspberry & chocolate. 

The only downfall to the Beachwood location is there isn't really any room to wait for your table. The hostess stand is by the door, so in the winter it's freezing while you wait. Looking forward to the new Beachwood location!"}
{"text":"This restaurant leaves a lot to be desired. Four of us ordered lobster tail and two were served cold, along with spinach not cooked and cold as a side dish.  Of four dinners, three were sent back because they were not cooked. (The 4th politely ate almost cooked lobster tail. ) The highly priced pasta was like a half portion and had little flavor. Foods were poorly presented.  When the three lobster dishes still were not cooked after being sent back the manager argued that the chef said it was done!! That was the end of dinner for two of us.  Pieces of lobster left on the plates were supposedly re-cooked and still were not. Although two were taken from the bill the attitude of the manager siding with the chef who had probably quickly defrosted the lobster in a microwave and not tested its temperature internally left  four us deciding never to go there again. The waitress was good but had no control over the situation. Also we ordered decaf and both who drank it could not sleep so it was probably regular coffee. This is a high priced less than mediocre restaurant   Four of us eat out often at top restaurants and this was the worst experience we have had."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great and the food was excellent! I can't remember the last time I had a steak that good."}
{"text":"I  give five stars because Dustin really listened to what we had to say when we offered constructive criticism. Our meal of fillet was amazing. The lobster fra diavoloa was less than spicy the lobster was good the pasta was more or less just a red sauce. The donuts at the end of the meal were good and hearty  although there were too many of them or they should be smaller! 
Tracy was by far the nugget of the night!! She should be a server as she is very personable and knowledgeable about food product. 
Courtney also was very nice although product knowledge was lacking. 
Dustin the GM came to the table at the end of the evening and I was able to let him know exactly what my thoughts were on the meal and the service. He was very receptive and even took notes at the table!! 
I am hopeful that this location will survive and am encouraged that the general manager wants them to do better! We will return based on the customer service that we received this evening!! 
Kimberly and will at the bar did a good job although they need to acknowledge the customer upon entry even if it is just with a beverage nap to let someone know that they have been seen!! My dirty martini was well-made, Kimberly was very personable and she is one that I would return to see. 
Overall a good a good experience hopefully tweaks will be made!!"}
{"text":"By far the best steakhouse in Cleveland. Always excellent service and food. Not too pricey for the quality of food and service. Make sure to leave room for dessert which is always delicious."}
{"text":"While Red breaks free from the image of the traditional dark, wood-paneled steakhouse staffed with grizzled, veteran waiters, it still offers a fairly traditional steakhouse menu supplemented with a little extra taste and a little extra style to each dish.  The result is high quality food served in a refreshing environment.

I had the fortune to sample several of the appetizers at the table:  The Steak Tartare offered a decent start: a fist-sized chunk of raw USDA Prime appropriately flavored with shallots and capers.  The Oysters were pretty average and maybe even a little on the small side of what you might expect at a steakhouse.  The Lemon-Garlic Shrimp was a little messy to share as an appetizer--I'd probably opt for the Shrimp Cocktail on a future visit.  I probably enjoyed the Calamari the most: relatively large pieces of squid, lightly and not overpoweringly seasoned that were minimally greasy.

The main event is the steak, and I chose the Aged USDA Prime Ribeye cooked Medium Rare.  The steak was cooked to absolute perfection.  The act of cutting into it could have easily been turned into a \"Beef.  It's what's for dinner\" commercial.  I was a little disappointed with the cut of meat.  I expected a little bit more marbling for a ribeye, and I know I've had better cuts (though admittedly not as perfectly cooked) at Cabin Club in Westlake.

For sides, I tried the Truffled Mashed Potatoes--potatoes thickly whipped with butter and truffle oil--which are not on the menu but apparently always or almost always offered as a special.  I am a little biased against mashed potatoes so I thought this side was just okay, but a lot of the people at the table were big fans.  I was pretty disappointed with the Parmesan \"Tater Tots.\"  I had my mind set on an inventive take on the school house classic, but instead these were basically just cheesy croquettes.  The Sauteed Asparagus with Bearnaise Sauce was about par for the course, but the Seared Killbuck Valley Mushrooms were quite good--a side I would definitely get to accompany a steak on a potential next visit.

Save room for dessert and order the Fresh-N-Hot Doughnut Holes.  The second they are set on the table, ignore both your fellow diners and the trio of compliments (chocolate, caramel, and raspberry sauces), and take a bite out of one while its hot.  It is like biting into a warm, heavenly pillow of powdered sugary goodness.  If I had not already been stuffed with a big chunk of tartare, other appetizers, a 16 oz. ribeye, and sides, I'm pretty sure I could have taken down an entire order.  The provided compliments are okay, but really, when the doughnut holes get cold, the magic has worn away.

Service was about average for a nice restaurant.  Missing was chummy warmness that often characterizes other top level steakhouses.  Our server fumbled through the menu and specials a little bit, but I'm not going to take off too many points for that (mostly because I wasn't pay that close attention having already perused the website and knew exactly what I wanted to have).

Red is definitely at the top level as far as Cleveland-area steakhouses go:  The quality of the food takes the restaurant a step-up from Hyde Park and Cabin Club (and several steps ahead of XO).  But, while Red is impressive, I think it falls short of my current Cleveland-area No. 1: Morton's."}
{"text":"Great steak and atmosphere. My steak was cooked to perfection and perfectly seasoned. My husband ordered his steak medium rare but it came out medium well which caused it to be dry.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in the mentality of the hostess and manager. Made a reservation for 6:00 on a Saturday but when we arrived she couldn't find the reservation. Very rude to is like we were a bunch of no bodies. They tried to stick us on the side of the bar and told us there were no booths available. They were reserved for people with reservations witch we had. The restaurant was empty. I will never go back nor recommend this place to know one."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to, and by far best in Cleveland. It's something no meat lover should miss."}
{"text":"Very good steak place in Cleveland.  I was very surprised to find this place but it was recommended by a good friend.  So I did not really know that this place infused something hot in almost every dish.  I liked it but not a place I could frequent much.  Here is what I had:

Drink - I ended up ordering the Hot Spicy martini.  Essentially a martini with sriracha in it.  The first one was awesome.  The second one made me want to vomit.  It was a little too much plus I started getting a head ache towards the end of the meal.

Lemon Garlic Shrimp - great appetizer that did not have chili flakes in it.  I wanted to try to calamari but I didn't have takers at my table.

Main Course - 8 oz filet topped with Blue Cheese.  If you get this cooked any more than medium rare you should be smacked in the face and A-1 sauce should be poured in your pants

Sides - we tried the cream spinach, potatoes au gratin and truffle whipped potatoes.  The sides were so damn good.  Luckily we had three guys so we could go a bit nutty on the sides to get a taste of them all."}
{"text":"Red is a favorite of our family. Love the steak with bernaise sauce, the green beans with pancetta and pine nuts is TO DIE FOR, and the donut hole dessert is AMAZING. The atmosphere is very cool and the service is great. Though the price is steep the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I have heard so much about Red so we decided to try it out. We were very disappointed from the the moment we walked in. We should have turned around and left. From how our friends described the restaurant, I was expecting so much more. We did have reservations and were escorted to our table in the bar area. I did not want to sit in there, it was very loud and the tables were literally on top of each other. I asked to be moved, and was told no because we did not request the dining room when we called. We had no idea we had to do that and they would not move us! Again, we should have left. Our tables was so close to the tables on either side of us that the waiter could not even fit in between. We had to listen to the conversations on either side of us for the entire evening. I could actually type out the conversations for you, but I won't bore anyone. My chair was broken and wobbled all night (asked for another, and it was wobbly as well), it was freezing, the food was ok, my baked potato was under cooked and had to be sent back twice and was still undercooked, I have had much better steaks at other restaurants, and the restrooms were filthy. Needless to say I will never go back to Red and I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Took father for 70th bday. Order calamari- 8 out of 10 very good. Drinks about 10 bucks butt 2 will kick your culo. All the sides were very good but I did not care for the tater tots kind of like fried mashed potatoes.  I don'rember the others but they were good. Got the rib eye medium rare, it was excellent. I tried a bite of the New York strip and it was even better. The crust on it is amazing. Every one says this place is so expensive. I have eaten at crappier places and paid more. This is definitely worth the money. Don't get me wrong its a splurge but it is no more than any other high end steak house. I split the steak and I was so full I had to drink wine till 1am and watch Itchi the Killer. Poor me ; ) Everything that came out of the kitchen looked fantastic. You may want to split the steak with some one and get one or two sides. You can definitely do this place for under 60$ just watch how much you drink. Valet parking? will it kill you to walk 50 feet."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located next to Moxie, near the intersection of Chagrin and Richmond.  I enjoyed the house salad, Atlantic salmon and chocolate cake.  The salmon was very well prepared.  The mashed potatoes, mushrooms and green beans were delicious sides.  This is nice venue for special occasions."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not great.  Past experiences were much better.  The kitchen sent the wrong entree, but the correct one finally came and was \"comped.\"-a classy way to handle a problem.
Both men's and women's restrooms were disgusting.  The were dirty and missing essential things like toilet paper.  They should be inspected hourly.  I have been in \"greasy spoons\" and \"truck stops\" with much cleaner facilities."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed!!! Called several days before my anniversary to reserve a table. I mention to the person on the phone it was not only my anniversary but it will be our first time dining with them. Once seated and looking through the menu the waitress arrives to take orders,  I went with her recommendation, the c.a.b ribeye which was ok but she never mentioned the different sauces for the steak. After the dinner the waitress brings the dessert menu out and I'm thinking doesn't she know it's my anniversary, after feeling some kind of way. I make my way up to the front to ask the hostess didn't they see the notes on my reservation. This was supposed to be a surprise for my wife. The manager came to table with an apology but it was an uncomfortable and disheartening experience. I really had high expectations after seeing and reading so many different reviews before deciding to go to Red's."}
{"text":"One of the premier steakhouses in Cleveland. When its comes to class and elegance, this location hits the nail on the coffin. This is a place where you go on a special occasion or to impress your date. The staff is very attentive and warm. The food is very delicious and fulfilling. Expect to spend big here but its all worth it"}
{"text":"The best steakhouse I've been to in Cleveland so far.  

It was kind of hard to find (it's around a bunch of companies), but we called them and they gave us directions there.  I think what got us confused was that it's right next to Moxie so we missed the sign.  

Make sure you make a reservation, it tends to fill up pretty fast and we had to take a late reservation at like 8:30pm on a Sunday.  The place was really romantic and classy inside (read: dress a little fancy).  To start, we got the tuna tartare. So good and the plantain chips were a nice touch.   I got the CAB Filet Mignon and he got the USDA Prime Rib-eye.  Both were sooo delicious.  Perfectly cooked and so tasty.  I don't think I can tell between the CAB and USDA Prime, so I was thoroughly impressed with mine.  We also got a side of whipped potatoes and creamed spinach.  I could barely finish my food and had to pass on dessert :(  Our waiter was really attentive and good at giving us recommendations all night.  We also stayed well past their closing time since we started eating late but they didn't rush us at all or give any indication they were trying to close.  

Of course, it's a bit on the pricey side but it's a great place to go for a celebration.  Good portions, great service, and phenomenal food."}
{"text":"While not up there with the original Morton's on State or Kinzie Chop House in Chicago, Red was worth the trip. We had Alaskan crab legs for the table (delicious), fresh bread and olive oil, a couple of filets (perfectly done), seared mushrooms (tasty), broiled chicken (really good), and mac & cheese with lobster (subtle texture, not overpowering). Their wine list also has some gems we were happy to try.

Only one thing: the patio's smoking policy. The weather was perfect, so we wanted to sit outside, but a table full of dudes smoking cigars drove us in. That's the missing star in this review."}
{"text":"I was so excited when we decided to come here for dinner, since it has been ages since my last Red Steakhouse steak. We were trying to avoid downtown traffic, due to the snowstorm that was forecasted for that evening, so we went to the Beachwood location. This was my first time coming to the Beachwood location. Similar in style to the downtown location, modern decor and clean, we were seated right away. Our server was quite helpful in explaining the different grades of meats and the specials for the day. We ordered the porterhouse and the ribeye, with truffled whipped potatoes and Brussels sprouts as our side dishes. The meat was cooked perfectly in terms of what I requested, just enough pink and no blood oozing out. What disappointed me was the amount of seasoning the chef used, on the meat. It was so overly salted that I had gulped down two glasses of water within the hour we spent eating. The truffled whipped potatoes were also heavily salted, so we couldn't even try to balance the overly seasoned meat with the potatoes. Surprisingly the only dish that was tolerable was the Brussels sprouts, if you avoided the pancetta of course! I would've enjoyed the meal a lot more if they had just gone a little more lightly on salt. A little goes a long way! The meat was cooked so well, it's a shame that it was over seasoned!"}
{"text":"I'm going to write one of my shortest reviews ever.  Red is a steakhouse - brilliant steaks, enormous sides, great wine list.  A menu similar in style to a Morton's, Ben Benson's, etc...

Simply put, Red is the only place that I've had a steak better than steaks I cook at home.  I'll get a dry-aged prime ribeye from Whole Foods and cook it at about 850 degrees on my grill.  Sear, flip, sear, rest, finish indirect, tent, devour.  Salt and pepper are the only seasonings but it tastes like so much more after that perfect sear happens.  I've had ridiculously expensive steaks at all the \"best\" steakhouses (read: all the well-known steakhouses), and I can make a better steak than all of them.  I don't say that about much else, either.

But Red's prime NY strip, mid-rare, was mind-blowingly good IMO.  This is what I expect when I'm paying $40-50 for a steak that I'd pay $20-25 for at the store and cook myself.

We had a great Norman Zinfandel (the Mephistopheles) and their donut dessert sent us home feeling appropriately ill... in a good way.  A REALLY good way.

For giving me a reason to order a steak while I'm out, Red gets 5 stars from me today."}
{"text":"Great food, sides are big enough to share. Their Mac nd cheese is amazing have to get it. Capt. Nd coke 6.50 which is a deal."}
{"text":"Red's is a 5 Star meal and dining experience! 

It is a high end steak house which was surprising based on the location. 

The service staff were top notch. Extremely friendly and helpful. Your glass will never hit less than half full. They keep a watchful eye on their tables and make sure everything is moving smoothly. 

The salad was delicious! Steak perfectly cooked. Asparagus was great. Every part of the meal was 5 Star. 

I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fine dining steakhouse experience!"}
{"text":"The steaks were all insanely too salty, the sides were not \"family style\" as we were told. There was probably a total of 1 potato in the entire au gratin dish. One of the guests in our party ordered a ceasar salad and added chicken to it and when he got the bill they charged him $45 dollars for it, a salad on the menu is $10 and the waiter never mentioned that the chicken add on was going to be $35. Definitely not impressed and won't be going back, save your money and go to Hyde Park or Fleming's instead."}
{"text":"The four stars are mostly because my husband loved his steak.  I don't eat meat, so his opinion counts way more than mine when reviewing a steak house.  We came here for his bday and had fantastic service.  I just ordered sides, which were pretty bland.  He said his steak was among the best he's ever had, hence the four stars."}
{"text":"Why I'd post this review since it's hard enough to get a table there already is beyond me but, I need to give credit where it's due.

I've been to Red probably close to a dozen times over the last 3 or 4 years.  Not a ton but, there are some things in life that need to be sparingly partaken to fully appreciate.  Just to know where I'm coming from in this review I'm a total bitc* when it comes to a good steak.  I've sent my fair share back to the kitchen and once jokingly said that I've gotten more steaks for free in Cleveland than I've paid for.  Interestingly, I NEVER asked once for one to be taken off the bill!  Apparently, it's not easy to cook a medium-rare steak(?)

Red's decor and ambiance is refeshingly contemporary yet elegant.  Would I call it \"hip\"?  Well, no.  Would I call it stuffy?  Certainly not.  I guess it's somewhere in-between.  The outdoor patio is great though take caution they do permit smoking in this area so, if you're a hardcore non-smoker you might find this a distraction to your meal.

Anyway, to the point:  bar NONE and yes, that includes: Fleming's, Morton's, Hyde Park, Cleveland Chop House, XO, Ruth's Chris... Red makes THE best steak I have ever experienced in Cleveland.  I don't know how they do it and frankly I don't care.  The steak always has that nice heat-induced \"crust\" that many strive for but few achieve.  The flavor off this crust is immense.  The meat is very delicate and perfectly trimmed of excess fat and grissle.  This is noteworthy since I recently had a $50 steak at Hyde Park, grissle and all.  Red has never missed the cooking temperature on the steak once.  I find that remarkable.  By the way,  I'm still amazed how someone can order a cut of fillet prepared well-done but, if you do why are you surprised that they ask you if it's okay to butterfly it to cook it to that degree of doneness? 

They have a variety of sauces one can order as an accompaniment to your steak.  No, A-1 or Heinz is not one of them though, I guess in order to satisfy A-1 Die-Hards they've made their own in-house version.  The other sauces, of which Bearnaise is my favorite are certainly made in-house and are phenomenal.  The sides are aplenty and include sauteed spinach, Killbuck mushrooms, whipped potatoes with accoutrements and many more.  There is a nice selection of salads and even their seemingly unexciting \"chop-chop\" salad is delightful.  They typically will have a special steak or fish each evening.

I have always found their servers to be helpful, friendly and professional.  Red is a place to which you'll be glad you went!"}
{"text":"First time at Red.  The venue is very odd.  It is set in a commercial suite park.  Valet parking is almost a necessity.   I started with the stuffed hot pepper appetizer and moved into the heirloom tomato salad.  Both were wonderful the tomato was surprisingly ripe tasting for a late February night.   The entree was a filet mignon, medium rare and a small lobster tail.   Both were excellent, cooked to perfection.  I do not eat dessert.   So why not a 5 star rating?  
The bottle of wine I ordered came to the table with a vintage 2 years younger than what was on the wine list. I declined that bottle.  Instead of the sommelier coming to the table with suggestions for an alternate selection, I was handed the wine list again and asked to make  another selection. I still don't know if they have a sommelier.    I'm sorry but if I'm at a 5 star establishment, that problem is handled in a much more satisfactory fashion.  Company steakhouses like Fleming's maintain a real time I-pad based wine list.   If you don't have resources to maintain a wine list or employ a competent sommelier then you are not a 5 star restaurant.  Period."}
{"text":"Overall great food but with lackluster service. It should not take five people 2.5 hrs to eat. Food was delicious but the fish plates came out cold. Our server was very slow."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to celebrate something special, I really can't think of a better place to go in Cleveland than Red the Steakhouse. 

Beware: it can be difficult to find. It's tucked away behind Moxie in some shrubbery. Once you find it though, be prepared for the best meal I think you can find in Cleveland.

We celebrated my husbands birthday here this weekend. We started with some cocktails. The cucumber martini is well worth the money and really great. (You probably only need one, FYI). Then we moved onto dinner. We opted to forgo an appetizer. I had the house salad, hubs had the Caesar. For the main course... I had the 8 oz filet mignon. Holy perfection. I haven't had a better steak in cleveland. Or anywhere except maybe Chicago. For sides we had whipped truffle potatoes and some brussel sprouts. 

They gave us complementary donut holes with dipping sauce, which was one of the best parts of the meal. The atmosphere is chic and you really feel like you're at a top notch restaurant in NYC when you're here. I will be looking for my next reason to celebrate at Red!"}
{"text":"Best steaks in town!  The drinks, apps, bread, entree and desserts were 5 stars.  Great experience all around!"}
{"text":"Man, where do I start?  First off, a little hard to find.  Once you do find it the place looks really nice for Cleveland.  The servers are super friendly and knowledgeable.  The bread they give you is crazy good with olive oil.  Man I could just eat that all day.  Appetizers are insane.  Oysters were just right, the tuna was too good, and the house salad was dressed perfectly.  Main course, aged filet with a bearnaise or au Poivre sauce, need I say more.  The Bucatini, Meatballs & Peter's \"Red Lead\" is another 10 for me.  Oh yea, you need sides.  Get some Potatoes au Gratin, Green Beans, Pancetta, Pepper Flakes & Pine Nuts, and Parsley & Garlic Fries.  If you still have room for dessert.  Get the Fresh-n-Hot Doughnut Holes.  You haven't lived unless you had Red's doughnut holes."}
{"text":"Aged filet mignon, asparagus with Bearnaise and Mac n cheese. All were delicious and perfect. Our server was very informative and knowledgable of menu items. It had taken a long time for out entrees to come out but the restaurant offered for dessert or liquid dessert on them without us even having to say a word. 
Definitely a great steakhouse for Cleveland"}
{"text":"Oh my god, absolutely to die for. Ended up here on a whim for my brother's belated birthday celebration. How were they not booked with reservations for the night, I have no idea. We ordered appetizers (mussels diavolo and tuna tartar), steaks (prime bone-in and prime ribeye), horseradish crème fraîche sauce, a pasta (torchio alla pescatorre), and two sides (green beans with pancetta and seared mushrooms). I came, I tasted, and I conquered. Only thing I would not order again would be mussels and the pasta. Not because they were bad, but because I feel as though the menu has other items that would absolutely blow my mind. Whereas those two dishes were just good. 

To be completely honest the only downer was our server, who was pleasant enough but also slightly awkward and spoke so softly I couldn't hear him. I also sensed a condescending tone when we asked how the surf & turf options worked."}
{"text":"Red is by far my favorite steakhouse in Cleveland. The wait staff is pleasant, the atmosphere is upscale, and the food never disappoints. The price is definitely worth what you get, and staff knowledge about the menu is impressive. You may ask, then, why I have chosen to give only 3 stars. 
Red is one of my family's most frequented special occasion spots. Last night we went for my grandfather's 75th birthday. Upon arriving at 5:30, our entire party waited 15 minutes for a valet that never came. The majority of us had to park across the street. When we entered the restaurant, my mother explained the situation to the maître'd, but all he said was that they were very busy. I was confused as to why one of the most upscale and expensive restaurants in Cleveland would have an absentee valet service, and make no attempt to correct what was a less than impressive start to what would become a 3 hour meal. 
Our waitress, a blonde woman whose name escapes me, was a delight. However, even at 5:30, the service was very slow. To start we had calamari, stuffed peppers, and a cheese plate. All were delicious. I had the arugula salad, which was good but a bit underdressed. The majority of the family had steak, while I had the mussels. Interestingly, the sides were the star of the meal for me, particularly the sweet potatoes. They were probably the best I've ever had. 
While I do love Red, my experience last night was definitely sub par. I am definitely willing, though, to go back and give them another shot."}
{"text":"A vegetarian in a steakhouse? Who would have thought? There was a reason for my recent trip to Red The Steakhouse....a meat loving friend's birthday. The only requirement he had for his birthday was big, juicy, quality steak. Red has a great menu that more than fulfilled his requirement. However, if you are reading this review in hopes of enlightenment on the steak version of Red, you might as well stop reading now. 
First, and foremost the quality of the staff was beyond spectacular. My only problem with the restaurant is something that was most likely out of control by the staff. My friend called ahead to make reservations for his birthday...we had a big party coming (18). We had more that would have liked to come, but Red was unable to accommodate us due to the small size of the restaurant. If you plan on going I highly suggest making reservations! The staff was beyond friendly the entire night. There was no rush in our eating and I'm sure we were there at least 3 hours. I also loved the added touches they made since we were a birthday party. If you eat in one of the party rooms, the menu is designed by someone who made the reservation (in our case, the birthday boy). When we arrived the pre-determined menu choices were printed out on a special menu with a special birthday message at the top. This special added touch made the evening even more special. 
Now on to food. Let me just say that Red is the first and only steakhouse I can review with a 5 stars on their food. Since I knew ahead of time we were going to a steakhouse I e-mailed the head chef about our visit and not only mentioned that 3 vegetarians would be in the party, but one vegetarian was also gluten free. He replied back within the hour to let me know that Red would happy to cook for us the evening we came. I have e-mailed chefs before (due to my gluten intolerance) but never have received a reply back so soon.  
The night of the dinner arrived and I was anxiously waiting to see what they would have created for us. Like I said before, each person was given a menu (which included the 3 course menu). I was not expecting one at all since I wasn't planning on partaking in the meat extravaganza that occurred that night. So imagine my surprise when they handed the 3 vegetarians their own menus that were the same quality as the ones with the meat menu.  The kitchen staff created a 3 course vegetarian menu that was absolutely fantastic. Not only did we get the 3 course menu, but they also brought out a vegan (and gluten free) appetizer so we would have something to munch on as well while everyone else was eating calamari and steak tar tar. When dessert came I fully expected to be the only one not partaking since the carrot cake chosen definitely contained gluten. However, the staff baked a whole gluten free lemon tart cake (all for me!) which was absolutely divine. 
I never would have expected to have received such an amazing meal at a steakhouse but it seems I was mistaken. While I doubt I will ever go back to Red, I highly recommend them due to the quality of their amazing staff and food. The small sighs of contentment from my meat eating friends further confirms my belief in the quality of the food, vegetarian or otherwise."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. Steak was exactly as ordered. Make sure to try the Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Favorite steakhouse in Cleveland.  Also, probably my favorite restaurant overall in Cleveland.  

The food is phenomenal.  The first time I came here, I ordered the aged USDA prime filet mignon.  The second time I came here, I knew I had to order it again.  The steak was both well seared and well seasoned.  My medium rare steak had a nice pink center.  And the sides, which are a la carte, were amazing.  My party ordered the truffled whipped potatoes, the house risotto, and the asparagus with bearnaise sauce.  The pieces of asparagus were large, the risotto was creamy and well garnished, and the whipped potatoes were smooth and flavorful.

As a bonus, we were given complimentary dessert.  They serve donut holes, which as I remarked to the waiter, is a surprising choice for such an upscale restaurant.  These, however, are not typical donut holes.   They were large, extremely fluffy, and served with a set of 3 sauces.  The table favorite was the raspberry sauce, which was perfectly sweet and consistent.  Also served was a chocolate sauce and a caramel sauce.  We also got a complimentary slice of cheesecake with a blueberry compote, which had an extremely smooth texture.

Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  Not only did he know what was in the dishes we wanted, he also was able to describe the ingredients that made up the different sauces.  When there was something he wasn't sure of, he went back to the kitchen to ask the chef.   Service was more than adequate without being obnoxious.

My only criticism is that this restaurant is hard to find.  Nestled next to the Moxie restaurant, my friends drove by several times before realizing that Red was hidden behind the trees next to Moxie's sprawling outdoor patio.  But with food quality this good, this doesn't matter at all."}
{"text":"Good wine list, friendly bartender, good quality beef, but their seasoning overpowers the steak. If I wanted Montreal Steak Seasoning I'd go to Walmart."}
{"text":"picked this place for a small family gathering when in town for bro's graduation... ah... SO expensive! oh well, for the family, i guess it's ok... 

first of all, loved their classic BIG wooden door entry... wine cellar... i feel good already! the steak, sides, the lobster (super yum!), and the wine we ordered! my dad loved it, that's all it counts!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I made a reservation for 8:15 on a Saturday night for my moms birthday dinner. I had been raving about Red to my parents and was excited to take them. Although I have only been to the one downtown I assumed the Beachwood location would be just as phenomenal. We got there at 8:12 only to be told by the hostess that our table was being put together. Not a problem, however, I asked the hostess around 12 mins of waiting how much longer the wait would be, and was asked \"what is your name again?\". It was about another 5-7 minutes when we were then asked how many people were in our party, which was confusing since our reservation stated that information. We got sat and our server was on point to begin. Very friendly and knowledgeable. We ordered our drinks and food. Everything was going along well until it had been over an hour and our entrees still had not arrived. I politely asked the waiter if he knew when the food would be coming out to which re snidely snapped \"when it's ready\" and walked away. Our whole table was stunned- this nice, professional waiter had suddenly become rude and impatient with us! Finally our food arrives. My steak was rare and cold (I ordered medium rare), the Brussels sprouts were cold, my moms steak was also cold and rare (she ordered medium). We mentioned all this, and the waiters comment, to the manager. However, since we had been waiting so long for our food we really didn't want to wait longer for the items to be fixed. We just wanted to eat the food and leave- especially since it's going on 10 o'clock. We barely saw our waiter for the rest of the evening, most likely because his manager mentioned what we had said. We ended the dinner with the amazing doughnuts which were delicious and almost made everything worth it. At the end, when we were paying our bill, my dad mentioned to our waiter how great his steak was to which the waiter (who didn't even look at him) just says \"good\" and walks away. We regret the 20% tip we gave, especially since none of the food was discounted. The Beachwood location definitely gives the Red brand a poor reputation because I have never experienced anything like this at the downtown location- which I have dined at more than 15 Times. Needless to say, we were disappointed by the experience."}
{"text":"Steak and the setting as well as the service was perfect. It was expensive but the steak was the best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Yes. It really is that good. Sean took me out here for our anniversary last month. On occasion, I do really love a great steak and RED did not disappoint in the least. I had the CAB filet and Sean had the CAB Ribeye. Both were fantastic, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. We also shared an appetizer that was on special - fried clams with an avacado ginger aioli. OH MAN! Those clams were awesome too! 

A big part of the experience at a great steakhouse is the service, in my opinion, and RED nails it here too. Our waiter was clearly experienced and very knowledgeable. He knew that menu inside and out and given only a price range, selected an excellent bottle of wine for us. 

Overall wonderful experience - not more expensive than other top-notch steak houses. Love that it's local - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best steakhouse in Cleveland.  The ambiance is perfect, the food is superb, wait staff is outstanding.  My husband and I recently celebrated our 15th anniversary here.  Though we were seated, with reservations, in the lounge area, we didn't mind.  Our waiter was polite, enthusiastic, and very knowledgable about the menu and specials.  All cocktails were made perfectly.  Steaks were cooked properly and sides (risotto and sautéed spinach) were delicious.  Because we were celebrating our anniversary, dessert was on the house.  We will continue to enjoy Red for special occasions!"}
{"text":"I had the wedge salad to start. This was the only disappointing thing I had. I like when my wedge salad is on a chilled plate and when the lettuce is really crunchy. That was not the case here. For dinner I had the lemon garlic shrimp appetizer with the truffled mashed potatoes. Delicious."}
{"text":"Never been here heard a lot of great things server seem great at the beginning then a simple question on y the food is taking so long changed our dinner experience into a nite of mixed emotion # great food service-4"}
{"text":"This was by far probably the best food my boyfriend and I have ever had, although the setting was pretty crowded. Upon arriving we were asked to wait fifteen minutes after our reservation. Sitting down at the rather long table between us, the seating arrangements lead to difficult conversation with noisy diners sitting on either side. The service was slow, but the food is top notch."}
{"text":"Best steak I have ever eaten! I ordered the 8oz fillet, medium rare. When it arrived it was a bit rarer than I normally like, but it was so delicious I did not care. Ate every bite! Everything we ordered was wonderful (and we ordered A LOT!) Do yourself a favor and don't skip the appetizers or the dessert -- diet another day. Calamari was outstanding, as were all of the side dishes. The servers were excellent and very patient with my party, which lingered a long time. My only complaint is that the parking lot was full, forcing me to use the valet service, which I normally avoid, but they did a fine job."}
{"text":"Cold steak served on a cold plate. Is this a new trend, cook steak, let it cool, serve it cold? Dinner cost $700. Very amateurish. If your a foodie, you can skip this place."}
{"text":"Red is always a favorite. The key to a good steakhouse is the right equipment, broiling steaks at 1800. Red has it, secondly getting the internal temperature right, Red gets that right too.
Red also has a great wine list and a extremely knowledgeable sommelier, Cirrus is great and he knows his Italian Reds expertly.
The sides are good and they change them up with featured sides like truffled mash potatoes as well as a special mac and cheese.
Service is always excellent, an abundant group of waiters.
The ambiance is nice, hip steak house (lots of Red get it), nice booths and limited tables. You can also eat at the bar area (not available on opentable.com) you have to call.
I had the antipasti and chili calamari to start, both were good. Perhaps a charcuterie (go to Lolas to check theirs out) plate should be offered as well.
The Red salad was excellent, I had the NY strip USDA and the two others had USDA rib eyes. Steaks were cooked to perfection. The sides were broccoli, truffle mashed and 4 cheese mac and cheese. All were good as described.
The three of us shared the donut holes, always a good ending at Red.
a nice bottle of Red wine and dinner for 3 for $375 (incl tip) they better get it right and they do."}
{"text":"It seems I never learn.  We returned after our poor experience months ago.  On the semi plus side my wife liked her shrimp appetizer even though a couple of her shrimp were barely cooked.  The chopped salad was terrible.  Warm lettuce, almost no flavor in the dressing.  My carbonara was a disappointment - heavy and cloying with several of the shrimp seriously under cooked.   Did not finish 
my dinner as I did not want risk eating semi raw seafood.
They were less than half filled on a Friday night, I wonder why?"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently ate there while traveling. The food was perfect. The wait staff was perfect, especially Jake who took care of us like we were very special people. The experience was sexy, very cool and worth every penny.  It really was a treat. Filets were wonderful, salad so yummy, potatoes lovely and ending with the donut holes topped it off. Thank you to all."}
{"text":"The wife and I were looking for a restaurant to spend our 10-year wedding anniversary at.  I know my wife likes to eat at nice restaurants, so I decided to pick one that supposedly servers the best steak in Cleveland.  We made our reservations and off we went.

Upon arrival, we were quickly seated in the darkly lit, Red The Steakhouse.  It was a little hard to find though.  It's in a business district and apparently is the other half of Moxie The Restaurant.  If you're driving here, look for a Moxie sign, not a Red sign.  The door is hidden, good luck finding it.  I found it right away, but it doesn't look like an entrance.

We started off with tap water and a bottle of Cabernet.  Then we ordered appetizers - onion soup for the wife and the House Red salad for me.  My wife said the onion soup was 'over the top'.  She liked it.  My House salad was absolutely delicious.  It had baby greens, toasted pecans, goat cheese and a subtle, but delicious dressing.  It was awesome!

Then the wine arrived and it was a decent bottle of Cabernet.  I don't remember the name of it, but it was the 1st one in the Cabernet section and the hostess recommended it.  

Then our bread arrived.  The bread was awesome.  It was too hot to eat at first, but after it cooled down, it had a soft center and a crunchy crust - perfection.  The olive oil and herbs to dip it in were also very tasty.  So far, this was turning out to be a very good meal.

We both ordered the 14 oz New York Strip (medium).  I also ordered sauteed mushrooms and green beans as my sides.  My wife ordered a baked potato as her side.  Upon arrival, the steaks look awesome, but it was kind of dark in the place, so it was hard to tell if it was cooked right.  I believe it was based on the taste and texture.  The steaks were delicious.  They were seasoned fairly heavily with something that tasted in the neighborhood of Canadian (Montreal) steak seasoning.  It was a really good steak.  The green beans were seasoned and tasted awesome.  My mushrooms were overly seasoned, but still tasted good.  
Wife said that baked potato 'was just a potato'.  

The ambience was dark and romantic.  There was a large wine cellar and a private bar area.  The service was lacking as my water glass was empty for a while and the waiter seemed to disappear at times.  For the price of this restaurant, I expected top notch service.

With tip and drinks, the bill came to $250.  We didn't think it was worth the price, but the food was good.  It didn't blow our minds as we expected.  If we pay that much for dinner, it had better be a life changing experience.  Ok, not really, but it we'll try another place next time."}
{"text":"First time visit....
Had seats at the bar and our Bartender James was great. Very professional, friendly, and knowledgeable.

Ordered the Special Ribeye and for the price point, I can say I have had much better steaks in lower level restaurants. The sides (mashed potatoes w/ gravy & asparagus)were very good and our drinks were nice.

Will go back again to check outvthe rest ofvthe menu....."}
{"text":"This was a meal that I left feeling very conflicted about. I'll start off by saying that for something in this price point, you shouldn't run out of the best steak offered on on the menu. 

When we sat down we were told that they didn't have any of the 40 day dry aged CAB prime ribeye which was pretty disappointing considering that's what a few of us had intended to order (Note: they told us they did have it in the downtown location - so maybe better off going there?) I ended up selecting a cut off of the cab prime menu and the meal was great. My steak in particular was cooked to perfection but some others mentioned that theirs were a little over/under done - not something I would expect for a steakhouse. I've definitely had better steak in Cleveland. 

I also had the roasted beet & arugula salad and sampled quite a few of the signature sides all of which were absolutely amazing! I was also really impressed with their wine menu.

Their cheesecake deserves an entire paragraph to itself. Let me tell you I'm not exaggerating when I say this is the best cheesecake I've ever had (I've had a lot). They have flavors on a rotating schedule but the night I was there I had the cheesecake with the pear compote topping and I was blown away. I would return for the sole purpose of eating this cheesecake again - it's that good."}
{"text":"RED. Hip, contemporary, modern place..in Beachwood? what! Oh, and prepare to be stuffed.

We went here for restaurant week as well, and I was quite surprised about it. Even though I live on this side of town, I never really eat around here..mostly because it feels so commercialized and there's chains of restaurants...but nonetheless, off we went to try Red. 

For appetizers, I ordered the french onion soup. Mmmmm. That's one good, hefty french onion soup with gruyere. Mmmmmm. He ordered the RED salad...which was good as well.

For entrees, I ordered the salmon. Holy cow, that's a HUGE piece of salmon. It was cooked well- not too overcooked at all. He ordered one of the steaks though- and omg, that was a great steak. I kind of wished I had ordered it instead of my salmon.

On the side, as we didn't realize how huge the portions were, we got the sweet potato fondue- it's mostly sweet potatoes with marshmallow fluff on top...which was delish. But man....by that point, we were stuffed.

For dessert, I HAD to order the donut holes. Omg, those donut holes are amazing. I just saw the word on the menu and told him, \"we HAVE to get those!\". I was so surprised by it too- hot from the oven, a whole little pedestal of donut holes come out,  with three dipping sauces of chocolate, caramel, and..raspberry? But OMG, I could of eaten those donuts all day... they were good.

So, great on the portions and definitely a nice contemporary place to hang out with work friends or a work party. A little on the pricey side and our waiter was a little demeaning in that manner (kept pressuring us to get more...kind of scoffing that we were ordering not that much), so that took it down a star for me, but nonetheless, pretty good food when you're off of Chagrin."}
{"text":"It's far too seldom I am able to eat here (the $$$$ price point will do that), but I relish every opportunity I get.  The steaks are amazing, the sides just as good, and they have a fantastic lava cake dessert that I am especially partial to.

If you're lucky enough to find yourself at Red, try their aged USDA prime rib-eye; it is the best steak I've ever had, period."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful dining experience and meal.  The atmosphere is great.  My meal included a Caesar salad, a prime 8oz filet, roasted Brussels sprouts with pancetta, sauteed mushrooms, and for dessert their famous donut holes.  Oh, and to wash it down a bottle of Petite Syrah from Alexander Valley and a bottle of a Rhone blend from central coast CA (alright, I was part of a party of 4 so I didn't drink this all myself).  All food was cooked to perfection.  The service was very good.  Let me not forget about the bread they serve before the food arrives.....OMG.  I've been to some good steak joints when I lived in Chicago and this one can hang.  I'd suggest putting it on your list.  Ps - an 8oz filet runs $38 so it isn't cheap but for a special occasion I'd visit this place again.  And the donut holes are as good as every other post suggests."}
{"text":"Great steak. Really great.  Great sides and great service.  Not cheap at all but a really nice experience. Was a bit put off by choosing wine and the wrong vintage was presented.  The manager knew this but tried to pass it off,  it would have been easier to present and admit the vintage changed rather than act surprised then offer to go back and check incase there \"might\" me some more. Then made excuses about saving trees and Costa on reprinting menus.  When you are spending that money I expect genuine service, the server and the host were outstanding and had great name recognition"}
{"text":"Nice, trendy, PRIME steaks and I got 2 day old over cooked halibut.

I should of gotten the veal."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to this kind of restaurant. It was a bit dim, but calming atmosphere. The servers were very kind and helpful. I started off with the half dozen oysters, glass of bordeaux, then had a C.A.B. filet mignon with truffle whipped potatoes, and finished it off with a vanilla creme brulee.

I thought everything was marvelous. The oysters were so fresh, the potatoes were bursting with flavor, the fillet was the most tender steak I ever had, and the desert was a perfect finish. Now it was a bit pricey, but would only recommend this place of it's a special occasion. I wound say hands down best steakhouse in Northeast Ohio."}
{"text":"Good cheese selection. Filet mignon was good. Service was good, a bit stuffy, but it goes with the turf. Expensive, overpriced. Good meal for Ohio though"}
{"text":"Sonny P summed it up perfectly: \"One of the best steaks in Cleveland.\"  It really was.  Went here for a birthday dinner and the two of us enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.  

It was pouring rain during rush hour and it took 45 minutes to get from Downtown to Beachwood.  So I'm thinking they are going to call or be rude about me being 15-20 minutes late for my OpenTable reservation and they were nothing but nice and accommodating.  My girlfriend was even later because she couldn't find the place.  It's literally behind Moxie, so if you see that, you know you are getting warmer.

So what's good? The food.  I can attest that the ribeye was excellent and I was told the filet mignon was excellent.  You can actually choose the grade of steak you prefer.  I chose the prime, she chose the grade below but ordered a steak topping.

Why didn't it get the 5th star? I've learned to order my steaks medium rare because I can live with medium rare to medium, not medium to medium well.  Good thing I used this tactic, because my medium rare ribeye came out medium.  And finally, it was a birthday celebration, which I let the staff know about through the reservation.  Our waiter talked us into dessert for her birthday, then the bill comes and there's an $8 \"Happy Birthday\" dessert on it.  On her birthday and a $110 bill, you couldn't even throw in the dessert? (PS the dessert was very good)"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant is sexy.  The service and good were great. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I have been to many of the high end steak houses in the Cleveland area over the years including Capitol Grille, Delmonicos, Flemings, Hyde Park, Morton's and XO. While those places are good, Red the Steakhouse remains my favorite. The food, the atmosphere, and service are great. 

Went to Red this past Sunday. We sat at the bar and I had a couple of Old Fashioneds which were made good and strong. The bartender was very nice, and attentive. He kept my drink refilled until I said when. The bar at Red is very nice. It is well stocked with lots of options from top shelf stuff on down. There are a couple of TVs for those who like to watch sports while they drink though they are not too distracting to those who don't. The bar area is decent sized, but kept separate from the rest of the restaurant which is nice because it keeps the noise level down. 

We were enjoying our time at the bar, so we decided to eat at the bar. I skipped on appetizers this time around as the excellent bread with oil/spice dip was enough for me. Though I do recommend JB's Steak Tartare, and Brad's Stuffed Peppers both are excellent. I had the 16oz USDA Prime Ribeye which was cooked the way I like it (medium rare) and it was very tender and tasty. I also had a side of creamed corn which was very good. The asparagus with hollandaise sauce is good, as are the parsley and garlic fries. For desert I would recommend the donut holes, those are addicting to say the least."}
{"text":"This is THE best restaurant on the East side of Cleveland.  The service is excellent as is the quality of food.  The bar scene is relatively cool, and the drinks are good.  

When business people ask where they should take a client for a great dinner on the East Side, I always suggest Red and people are always happy.   

If you are from out of town trying to figure out where to have a nice dinner, start here.   

If you are on a budget and don't want to spend too much, then check the menu beforehand.  It is not a place for the budget constrained."}
{"text":"I've reviewed Red twice before and ate at it many more times than that. The food, including on my most recent visit, remains amazing. The steaks are cooked to perfection. One person in my group ordered a tuna steak done well beyond just seared and even that was prepared according to preference. The green beans remain my favorite side, and on this occasion I also liked the risotto of the day that included peppers and beef brisket. The food as always was a 5 star experience. 

Normally the servers are also 5 stars. I've had both male and female servers be efficient, yet funny. Attentive, yet cheerful. The female server I had most recently however committed enough small no-nos in a row to lose Red it's 5th star. I have not had this server before. 

She never offered cracked ground pepper with our salads. She let our empty salad plates sit on the table for 10 minutes before clearing them. She took away the bread dip and bread basket, brought more bread, but never brought more dip or asked if we wanted any more. 

There were 5 of us seated at a 4-top table - one person on the end. She reached all the way down the length of the table to get the water glass of the 5th person instead of walking around as other severs had done when they came around with water for us. 

She also changed our food order without asking! Red's potatoes are quite large. When we go here each person at our table usually orders one for themselves, and the Red staff usually mention that they are very large and ask to clarify if we are sure we want to order that many. We always say we've been here before, yes we know, and yes we each want one. On this last occasion though when we each ordered one, the waitress made no such comments. But when the food came out she only brought one potato, said she decided to only put the order in for one because they are so large and to let her know if we really did want the number that we ordered! That's way to big of an assumption for a server to make without asking! She nearly started a potato fight at the table. 

We also had a celebration at our table and they brought out free donuts for the table, but she neglected to ask as most servers do if anyone at the table would prefer another dessert or like to see a dessert menu as well, which I always do because I don't want to eat donuts."}
{"text":"Another amazing evening!  We had to change our reservations last minute from Red downtown to Red Brachwood on Valentine's Day, which put me in panic mode, but it was handled masterfully by Red management.  

Dinner was fantastic - clams casino (as always) were spectacular, the shrimp cocktail was fresh and tasted amazing, and the ribeye was served at  aperfect rare plus.  Always a special and romantic experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE steak and this is hands down the greatest steakhouse I have ever visited.  The CAB ribeye is a spiritual experience.  Great steak doesn't need a sauce, but I do suggest giving them a try... I'm particular to the peppercorn one, and it only enhances the greatness of this steak.

Only appetizer I've tried has been the french onion soup.  It is very good, with a nice thick quantity of cheese on top that makes you want to scrape the outside of the bowl with your spoon.  I always had the arugula salad with proscuitto and loved it.

Although I could rarely eat them with my dinner, I always ordered a side of the green beans.  I don't like vegetables any more than the next guy, but trust me on this... with the pepper flakes and pine nuts, once you start eating these things, you CANNOT stop.  I would save 1/2 my steak and eat the leftovers with the green beans for lunch the next day.

This is an expensive restaurant, but there is value here.  This restaurant is one of the things I miss most about Cleveland.  My wife made a reservation for my birthday last year and they brought me a complimentary dessert.  They even brought me the wrong steak, but I didn't care (they eventually brought the right one), as it only prolonged a very pleasant evening.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Cleveland, I make it a point to go to Red. I used to live there three years ago and if there was ever an excuse to go to Red, we went! Anniversaries, promotions, babies. I always get the 16oz prime rib-eye and I am never ever disappointed. Occasionally I'll order a sauce, but most of the time I eat it just as it is given to me. Perfectly seasoned magic every time.

This time around, I ate at the bar (was in town by myself on business). There was a mix of lively young people and more established foodies. I had the doughnut holes for the first time and they were really really good. It is accompanied by three different sauces but, again, I just liked this freshly fried confection best all by itself.

Red's steaks are top-notch and it still it my measuring stick for a good steak. Around here in DC, steaks are ridiculously priced for what you get and I always leave these places wondering, Just when am I going to Cleveland again?"}
{"text":"The finest restaurant in Cleveland, hands down.  I have never had anything wrong with any meal.  Red may be a bit pricey as mentioned in almost every other review, but its quality!  They have several competitors in the neighborhood (I can count 4 other high end steak places within 4 miles of them) but they beat them all, consistently.  The steaks are fantastic, and always prepared as ordered.  The sides are out of this world.  I particularly like the parsley and garlic frites, the au gratin potatoes, the sautéed spinach, and my wife swears by the brussels sprouts w. pancetta, garlic and shallots.
I almost always go w. the featured rib eye, and it comes out to perfection every time.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fresh donut ball dessert, fried when ordered, sprinkled with sugar powder and served w chocolate, caramel and strawberry sauces.  Incredibly good.  Red has all sorts of option on their menu, such as seafood and chops, but I stick with what I love.   The service is very attentive, and the place very urbane.  I use Red as a celebration spot when I really want to enjoy a great dinner experience."}
{"text":"Very poor experience from a \"high end\" steakhouse.  The seafood menu description was clearly not what was delivered.  We were out for my wife's B-Day, even cancelled out reservation at Capital Grill (very big mistake), and when the manager was made aware of the issue, which mind you, was a very easy fix, the only comment from him was, \"Happy Birthday\".   The GM was not much help either,  attempted to cure the problem with cheap gift cards, no thanks. 

So anyone reading this review, do yourself a favor and DO NOT go to Red, in Beachwood.   I cannot speak of the Cleveland location, since I've never been there. But if the manager from the Beachwood location is reading this....you sir, are a class A ass#%^*, you have no concept of customer service. 

Next time, we will go to Capital Grill, when the experience is always top notch.

One more thing, I'm just using CG as an example of great service, I'm not by any means endorsed by that business. My advise is to have an enjoyable meal with friends and family, just DO NOT give Red your hard earned money."}
{"text":"Best Steak I've ever had.  I've eaten at over 50 steak houses in my lifetime.  My GF had a strip steak wagyu that was out of this world.  My bone in rib eye was amazing.  Our server was a bit on the stick up your ass end of things, but the manager who told my GF that they were simply out of toilet seat covers in the handicapped toilet was unprofessional.  The food was dynamite, not to mention the chocolate/mint gelato they make in house.  Forget those donuts, get the molten chocolate cake and the gelato."}
{"text":"The first thing I want to say is you will NOT find this place by looking for a sign saying Red's Steakhouse. We drove around and around and around looking for it. We finally gave up and went into Moxie just to get food of some sort. Well, turns out they're connected. Literally. The hostess led us through a hallway and then checked us in and seated us at another hostess table. Apparently they're owned by the same group but Beechwood will only allow them one sign and since Moxie was there first, Red doesn't get one. 

Food was absolutely delicious. Warm bread and dip, a heavenly Caesar salad, and the best steak I've ever had. My mom and I both had the C.A.B. Prime (certified Angus beef) filet mignon so we could try it with different toppings and really compare. I will say if you order the garlic topping, you better REALLY like garlic. I have to admit I wasn't expecting to get my steak with just a pile of garlic on top of it. Luckily I do and as a bonus I should be protected from vampires through Halloween!  

The only complaint I had about service was that I'd heard they had excellent cocktails, but the wine and cocktails are on separate menus. So despite wanting a cocktail I got wine because it wasn't until the server offered the couple at the table next to us a cocktail menu I realized that's why I hadn't seen any. I understand why they're separate since the wine alone was huge, but I think that both should be given by default rather than needing to ask for the cocktail menu. 

I should also say that I dinged them on the noise level but they may not deserve that. We happened to be there the night the Indians made the World Series. The cheering when they won the game was actually pretty cool, despite not being a sports person, because it was one of those Cleveland unity moments. But the loud talking and yelling, particularly from one table of men, was less pleasant. But again, restaurant might not deserve that ding since that's an exciting moment and I don't know what it's like there on a regular night. 

Also, be aware that if you don't order sides, you will literally get a plate with JUST your entree on it. This wasn't a problem since we were too stuffed to order dessert as it was, but it was just a bit surprising not to even get a garnish or anything. 

If this was a different restaurant I would give them 5 stars. But for $250 for 2 people I expect things to be, well, perfect. So yes, I am being VERY nit picky. But a restaurant that strives for perfection deserves to be judged by that criteria and they're just not quiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiite there yet."}
{"text":"I really like steak. A lot. I have been fortunate enough to eat at many fine steakhouses, including Cut, Peter Luger, Keene's, several Arnie Morton's etc. If you want a great meal, eat at Red. The crab cake app was terrific, lots of crab and little filler. My prime ribeye was slightly underdone but had a fantastic flavor, my wife's filet was perfect and I was jealous. The horseradish creme fraische was sublime. The sides were delicious (creamed spinach, Brussels sprouts, tater tots) and the fresh doughnuts with sauces were awesome. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"First class, beginning to end.  No detail left out.  Amazing.  Steaks cut and cooked to your exact request.  Truffle potatoes are the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Nom! I had the market catch with brussel sprouts and the fish was delicious. Came with a special sauce but all I needed was a few lemon wedges. Cooked perfectly. 

My colleagues had the porterhouse and the filet mignon, and the porter was on the smaller side, but was cooked as requested, and the filet seemed to be a hit. 

My martini was on point. The prices were, well, high, as to be expected, and the restaurant seemed to be quite masculine, as they weren't many females dining, but overall, a great experience for a nice dinner while traveling."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago and being told this was the best, I had my doubts. I've been to many great steakhouses and this one ranks right up there. Service was excellent and the place is very cool inside. The New York strip was an excellent piece of meat and cooked perfectly. Great sides to share and the doughnuts for desert are incredible. The only problem is that it is very difficult to locate. Sitting behind Moxie I had to drive around several times before I saw the very little sign. It was worth the effort. Check it out. You'll be quite pleased."}
{"text":"BEST STEAK EVER

Our table of 8 in full agreement. Excellent sides. Wine selection so/so. I'm super biased to anything Sonoma County. Heavy Napa list. Blah. 

Highly recommend the ChopChop salad. Very Mediterranean-ish.

The decor was very SF, interesting rusted panels lining the wall mixed with stone. Very Chic (one pinkie in the air) for Beachwood OH."}
{"text":"Easily the best steak I have ever eaten (prime aged ribeye). Attention to detail was great and our server, Stacy, was outstanding."}
{"text":"The food was up to par with any major city. My only complaint is the disgusting fruit flies that were all over the place. It sure distracted from an otherwise enjoyable experience."}
