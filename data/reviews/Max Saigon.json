{"text":"The service was prompt and friendly. The food was delicious. Restaurant was very quiet. The decor did not change much from the previous China Max."}
{"text":"A small family own restaurant. I m pretty impressed with their menu which offers from street food to hot pot and of course typically vietnamese dishes. It reminds me of those restaurant in Southern California. I visited them twice this week. Both times i have good experience. The service was good and i tried pretty much from squid salad to sizzling beef to ph or bún ch cá or their seafood hot pot also their big variety of drink as well. They was busy tonight. We went there around 7:30 and there are 2 big parties ahead of us. The waiter tried pretty hard to serve all of us. We have to wait a while for our food but i kinda expect that since i saw they were short of help and busy at the same time. The owner lady always check on us both times i was there and make sure we r happy with the service. So i would definitely come back whenever i m in mood for good vnese food with a big variety of dishes. This place will be the one and their menu which is really much make them stand out from other competitors. Definitely MUST check out and support local business!"}
{"text":"Sadly this place was empty on a Thursday lunchtime.  I hope that changes as the food here was delicious.  They have been open less than 2 months so they must be relying on word of mouth.  I would not have known of this place if I had not been searching Yelp for a good alternative to my current favorite Pho place.  I eat Pho about once a week and have a favorite place but a) they raised prices to an amount that is ridiculous for a lunch and b) it will probably close once he opens his next restaurant.  
The waiter at this restaurant did not speak the best English but that wasn't really a problem.  I had the rare beef Pho and the broth was one of the most flavorful I have had in a long time.  It was delicious.  My work colleague ordered his standard fried rice and was also very impressed, not only with the flavor but also the serving size.  We will most definitely be back again."}
{"text":"If you like MSG, this is your spot. I can tolerate MSG really well but this restaurant got me tapped out. The worst thing is, I ordered ballut and got rotten eggs instead. The owner offered to make another one HOWEVER, she doesn't guarantee they would be ballut!?!! I was shocked to hear that. Anyways, try this place and your own risk! I gave this place one star because the server was nice.
P.S don't be surprised if your beef is sour."}
{"text":"Had the rice plate with pork chop and sausage and something else. It was as tasty as any I'd ever had. The service was friendly and excellent too. Also had order of spring rolls that were wonderful as well. Looking forward to trying the pho next time I visit."}
{"text":"They have authentic Vietnamese food and the service is quite hospitable. I would rate this a 10/10 and I will definitely be going back  thank you!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first visit here. We had the chia drink with passion fruit jelly, pho Tai, and bun thit nuong. All delicious! Like that they have more options than your regular Pho place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying Max's Saigon. I'm a big fan of \"whole in the wall\" restaurants, and Max didn't let me down. I had Egg Rolls and the Seafood Pho and my wife had a beef with crispy noodle dish. Everything was delicious. There was nothing fancy at Max's, including the canned soda, but the food was great. We will return."}
{"text":"went with the family.
small little place, which is fine with me since has that Vietnam feel to it. in Vietnam, most phone places are either eaten outside or in houses, which gives it that home feel to it.
the decor also gives you that Vietnam feel to it. so if you really want to know what's its like eating in Vietnam. I'll suggest this place. 

they have hot pot and tons of desserts there also. 
my aunt said their \"bun bo hue\" was amazing. she is a picky eater, so that says something."}
{"text":"Love that this has a lot of variety compared to the Vietnamese restaurants that are in AZ."}
{"text":"The baby clams dish (under street food section) was pretty good. I could use more of the shrimp crackers though.  For the amount of clams you get, 4 shrimp crackers is not enough.  If I ever come back here,  I'm definitely asking for extra crackers next time.  

Bun Bo Hue (Hue style beef soup) was NOT good.  It was unusually sweet and lacked depth.  

Bo Kho (beef stew) was okay. Not a hit for me but it wasn't bad.  I would suggest dipping it with bread instead of the rice noodle option.  Because the consistency is so thick, eating it with noodles makes it a soggy mess.

Service:  typical Vietnamese restaurant service, which I am more than used to and actually prefer, compared to restaurants where the server HOVERS and asks you every 5 mins if you're doing okay.  I'm fine with bring me my food, refill my water when its empty, and leave me alone so I can eat/I will let you know if I need you.   HOWEVER, our server was lackadaisical, lackluster, and just plain depressing.  I got the impression that he hated life.....  I understand it's a newer place, and they're probably working out the kinks.  But they say first impression is pretty important.  I truly believe in that concept.  I wish our server smiled, at least.  When he came to take our order, he just stood there with his pad/pen and kinda stared at us without asking if we were ready.  Even when we first walked into the restaurant, since it was our first time there, we didn't know if it was a seat yourself kind of place or wait to be seated.  So we made eye contact and waved to the guy at the counter (our server) and he just stared at us... and kept staring.   Maybe a smile or a HELLO would be cool.  

The thing that drew me to this place was that they offered some of my favorite Vietnamese street foods on their menu - baby clams with shrimp crackers, coconut snails, sticky fish sauce wings....   My overall experience though, was disappointing."}
{"text":"My what a great visit I had when I went for dinner at Max Saigon. I had a large  bowl of the best soup that I have every had. The broth was definitely the item 1that made this soup so tasty. There was such a large quinity of other items with this bowl. I had a glass of delicious tea.
Staff were very helpful and made sure I had everything I needed.
 Cost here was very reasonable and all items that I had was not over priced for sure."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.Wonderful flavors, everything is fresh.

Top 3 wow dishes:
Green Mango salad (with calamari) was the best I had ever had.  We could taste the fresh lime juice and enough chili to taste but not to be spicy in the \"dressing\". Calamari was tender and fresh and warm.  Even with it mostly gone we were fighting over bites.

The special tea, there is a nice full ginger taste mellowed with the honey flavor (a fair amount of honey in this drink).  The other flavors are there and make a nice well rounded taste but don't stand out strongly.  Then it finishes with a nice ginger bite.  If you love ginger brews and are ok with some sweetness, you will love this drink.  Hubby doesn't like strong ginger brews but still really liked this because of the flavors rolling across the tongue.

The mixed fruit drink.  Again several flavors that played over the tongue.  I got the lychee one and I could taste the perfume of the lychee and the mint and lime a well as other fruit.  Hubby is not into the Vietnamese fruit drinks but he would have drank the whole thing if I Iet him.

We had the chili shrimp.  Large shrimp. The sauce was good and on the spicy side but they are meant to eat whole (heads and shells) as the outside is where the sauce is.  I know not everyone likes the shell, but if you peel it there is not as much flavor to the shrimp (cooked well but no strong flavors).

I had the seafood with rice noodles fried.  This is where the rice noodles puff up large.  The sauce was very good and again everything was very fresh.

Hubby had the pho soup and he really liked it.  He would say the broth is excellent. I would say it was very good (I knew of a place in northern CA that had a broth that could cure all ills and I still compare all pho broths to that one).  

We would come back and get everything again but can't wait to try some other dishes - along with the green mango salad!

A side note:  This is not a quick in and out place.  We were there almost 2 hours.  Food came out as it was ready, so we go the mango salad and drinks, then the seafood noodle dish, then the chili shimp, and then the pho, and the fruit drink at the end.  And ordered a coffeea at the end also which came out quickly.
They were mostly full (a couple of tables were empty) and they were busy taking care of everyone.  It was clear they were all working hard and working at being attentive (stopping by often), but they might need another person out front if they are this busy all the time.
One couple ordered pho and were in and out quicker (they got their meal maybe in 10 minutes)."}
{"text":"During one of my bouts of insomnia last week I noticed that Max Asia is now Max Saigon and it's Vietnamese instead of Chinese cuisine.  Well, I had to check this out.  Max Asia was one of our favorite local places.  My husband and I stopped in for lunch a couple days ago and initially didn't have a great impression.  There was a group of 3 men in the middle of the restaurant arguing over what sounded like the terms of a loan.  You really want 20+ people to listen in?  Well I guess so.  Weird.  I think one of the guys either owns or worked at the restaurant too.  

The service was friendly, but very disorganized.  It took awhile to get our drinks and our order taken, but we weren't in a hurry, so it wasn't too bad.  I started with their special tea which has honey, ginger, lemongrass, mint, etc.  This was excellent because I had a horrible cold, and I enjoyed the tea so much I took another one to go.  $3.25/each.  My husband had the hot tea which is only a buck.  Nice flavor on that as well.  

We started with an order of egg rolls ($2.99) which were small, but very nicely done.  Great fresh flavors.  I had the rare filet pho ($6.95) and my husband ordered the noodle bowl with shrimp, pork, and an egg roll ($8.25).  My pho came out very quickly and I was happy to dig in because I wasn't feeling well.  It was beefy and noodley and just what I needed.  I shared a few bites with my husband and we were chatting away, not realizing that quite a bit of time had gone by and his noodle bowl hadn't arrived yet.

One of the people at the booth next to us got up around that time and asked about his entree as well.  His child and wife had their food, but he was still waiting on his.  It took at least 15 minutes for my husband's food to come out.  We saw our neighbor get his plate shortly before that.  The timing was really off.  I know they are newer so I'll cut them some slack because everything was delicious and the prices are reasonable.  We'll give them a little time to get the timing down and then be back for sure.  Great little place.  Just right now, take your patience with you."}
{"text":"I came here recently and walked away feeling disappointment, mostly because I really wanted this place to succeed and I think it has a lot of potential but our last meal didn't leave the same impression I initially had. I ordered my favorite, the mango salad with squid. The salad was very good and well seasoned, but the squid was spoiled and I could tell from the fishy taste that it was probably old. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively & literally) that I'm afraid I won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"Admittedly, we were tired of Arizona American restaurants and happy to find a very good Vietnamese restaurant .08 miles from the Chandler Best Western where we're staying. The staff was friendly and helpful and the food good enough to compete in Orange County (\"Little Saigon\").

Each of us tried a fruit chia (pictured): mango and lichee, diluting the sweetness with ice water.

The green papaya with tender calamari was very good, the fried chicken wings in garlic butter even better (not notably garlicky). Best of all was the crispy rice noodle with beef and vegetables. It is in my experience rare to find crispy rice noodles on menus of American Vietnamese restaurants, and I love it!

I can wholeheartedly recommend the restaurant to even persnickety aficionados of southern Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"best place to get your Vietnamese craving, made to order plates & vermicelli bowl, with  friendly faces and 5 star service . don't mind recommending this place."}
{"text":"This pho place is the best place in town!! Owners are incredibly nice and welcoming. My boyfriend and I always come in and get P4 the pho with rare steak. The broth is so full of flavor and the side veggies are always very fresh. I have also tried the spicy beef noodle soup and that is delicious as well! All the teas are so good and refreshing since they import the teas straight from Vietnam! We come here every week (almost everyday) and will continue to be regulars. :)"}
{"text":"First visit here. I recommend the spring rolls, they were pretty good. Good shrimp and pork ratio to noodles. I ordered rotisserie chicken and shrimp fried rice, I originally wanted seafood soft noodles but they didn't have any noodles for that specific dish. The rotisserie chicken was over cooked and very dry. It was half of a Cornish hen that tasted more like chicken jerky.  Not worth $9!I was looking forward to the shrimp fried rice but it tasted like soy sauce fried rice with 6 pieces of shrimp. I've had better Vietnamese food and I love Vietnamese food! The Vietnamese iced coffee to go had way too much ice and they didn't even fill up the coffee."}
{"text":"New favorite.  I've had this place bookmarked for awhile.  Employees are awesome and attentive.  We had the fish sauce wings, rare beef salad, and crab noodle soup.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pho is the only thing I feel like eating when it's cold/gloomy or when I'm sick. Today, I was sick  and craving Pho, so I was pleasantly surprised to learn Max Saigon had its grand opening last month and was only a short drive away.

I called to place an order for pickup (Pho, rare well-done steak) and they said it'd only take 5-10 min. I zipped over and it was on the counter when I walked in. The cashier was super friendly, even though there seemed to be a slight English language barrier (*the best Asian restaurants always have that slight language barrier though, which just goes to show how authentic it is--being Asian, I think I'm allowed to say that...). There's an extra charge to use a credit card on orders under $10 (which my pho was, so it's not a big deal since lunch was affordable). 

The portions seems a bit small based on the size of the takeout containers, but I was pleasantly surprised my soup bowl was filled to the brim when I poured it out at home. There were less noodles than I typically get when I eat at other pho places, but I got full nonetheless."}
{"text":"The pho was fine, a little lacking in flavor, but it was the owners toddler son who prevented me from even attempting to enjoy my meal.  He was screaming, kicking us, and actually climbed into our booth and grabbed my friend's spoon before I got up and retrieved the mother to get her son. I understand that some people need to bring their children to work, but then highly recommend that you find some other source of entertainment for your child, than harassing the customers."}
{"text":"Love it here! Bun Bo Hue is so good. Friendly service. I will be back for Bo Ne'. 

They also have many Vietnamese dessert options..."}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese place! Pho and spring rolls were fantastic. Can't wait to try more on the menu. Def recommend this place"}
{"text":"I really enjoy family run businesses and this is exactly that.  When I try a new Vietnamese (new to me) restaurant I try two-dishes or two separate days.  Pho (of course) and a rice based dish and I'll say that both were excellent.  Great flavor, fresh ingredients and the taste was just what I expected and a little bit more.  

Fair pricing, good service and friendly owners.  The restaurant is behind the old Bosa's Donuts on AZ Ave, and a standard strip mall.  You can tell the owners have all their money into this place, but if you're expecting a nice ambiance, ultra-modern style Viet. restaurant, this is not it, but the food is good.

I say this because some people won't go to a Vietnamese restaurant unless it looks ultra-clean and modern....they get the job done with a minimal investment, but I wouldn't bring a first-timer here unless they absolutely do not mind hole-in-the-wall, but the food was great and afterall that is why I went........I'll be back ..."}
{"text":"Delicious drinks and yummy starter dishes.  My favorite is the passion fruit drink and the mango squid salad."}
{"text":"Sent my husband here because I was craving some Vietnamese not realizing it was the day before the Chinese New Year and they closed earlier. We had ordered online and I guess YELP wasn't aware of their holiday since it let us order but it all worked out anyway. These people were super nice and the lady went out of her way to make our food anyway even though their chef had already gone. I was super happy to get my spring rolls since I was craving them so badly. I gave 4 stars for now because we have yet to taste the actual chef's cooking. We will be back when the cravings start again!"}
{"text":"I was looking to see if there's anything good and new I could try on yelp and I stumbled upon Max Saigon. My husband and I ordered a mango squid salad, a beef pho, and crab noodles. They took their time to make the food (not that long but longer than normal restaurants) and first came the mango squid salad. I have to say, I really liked it! The squid was actually warm instead of cold like most meat on Vietnamese salads I've had. It was my first time trying a mango salad so that left a really good impression. Then came the beef pho. I didn't really try it but I saw it coming out with super hot broth so I like that. And then my crab noodles came and to be honest it wasn't the best crab noodles I've had but it's the best I've had in Arizona. But I wish they provided tofu pods and banana flowers, I think I would have enjoyed it more. I liked their customer service, they were very attentive and Catherine (perhaps the cook or owner) was really nice to greet us to make sure everything was good. I'd definitely will try this place again and I absolutely looking forward to try one of their milk teas!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Clean and classy looking. Most importantly every single dish here tastes more authentic than other pho places in town. I either eat here once a day or everyday because the menu has a good variety of almost everything from street vending or fancy dining menu. I can give this place a 5 stars in a heart beat. Come and try out everything"}
{"text":"The beef was SOUR!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my god.... I couldn't believe it. They served us old and close to rotten food. It's really sad for me to write this because I was excited for a new Vietnamese restaurant in town and I was so ready to support my people! And the workers were nice but I don't know if they care about their customer's health and wellbeing. It is so not ok to keep using old and spoiled ingredients.. people can get sick with food poisoning! 

Also, the shrimp in the vermicelli kind of stinks (probably also old) and had no seasoning/grilled taste. Very plain, similar to the cold shrimps in spring rolls. 

I did enjoy the egg roll in the vermicelli. And the fish sauce wings were good, that's why I'm giving 2 stars. But will I dare come back and test the capabilities of my stomach? Probably not."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the food and the service! The staff was extremely helpful and polite. If you're in the area I would highly recommend bringing your entire family along with a few friends and a few of their friends. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Had Pho and spring rolls with my girlfriend for lunch. Prices were great and so was the food! The pho broth was incredibly flavorful. The spring rolls were $3 for two decently large rolls, and they were very fresh. Can't wait to be back to try some vermicelli and hot pot dishes!"}
{"text":"Good Vietnamese fare, good value!

Recommended!

My friends and I wanted to find a new place for lunch today, and a quick Yelp search turned up Max Saigon. Given the positive reviews, we agreed to give it a try - and we were glad we did!

Food:
We were all very happy with our food! I ordered the Chicken Curry with Bread (N10) and a hot tea. The curry flavor was good, and not too spicy. In fact, I added a bit of chili sauce (which you can ask your server for) to kick it up a notch. The bread was fresh, and a nice change from rice or noodles. The curry was loaded with dark meat chicken, which was tender and flavorful. It also had a few potatoes and carrots. The only issue was the tea was only lukewarm - not hot at all. The refill was somewhat better, but still not what I consider \"hot\".

My friends ordered the Crispy/Softly Pan Fried Egg Noodles with Seafood (N16), and the Pho Fillet, Beef Ball (P5). As with the curry, the dishes were very good, with ample portions.

Cost:
The cost was reasonable. My Chicken Curry was only $6.95, and the tea was $1. Considering the portion size and free refills of the tea, this was great value!

Service: 
The staff was attentive and came by to check on us a couple times to refill drinks, etc. Our food was served at different times ranging from 9 to 23 minutes after we ordered. It would have been nice to get everything at once, but the wait wasn't terribly long.

Atmosphere:
The place is quite spartan inside. We sat at a booth, which was comfortable. Still, come here for the food, not the atmosphere!

Overall:
The food was great, and they have lots of interesting items on the menu. We all agreed, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I found this gem from a friend's recommendation on Snapchat (where everyone finds food nowaways haha.) I've had the crab noodle soup, and it's sooo good. We met the owner, Catherine the first time I've tried this place. She told us the soup is made with real crab, no wonder I'm always craving it - it is SOOOO GOOOD and you can definitely taste it. She was very informative about her food and menu, and definitely provided a few recommendations! I haven't found a place that satisfies my craving the way this place does for the Bun Rieu. Definitely go try it out!"}
{"text":"Came here for birthday dinner. It was our first time here started with spring rolls, egg rolls and garlic butter chicken very good and tasty. I ordered the fish noodle soup and even though I'm not much for soup this was very tasty and filling. Other things we ordered included vermicelli noodle bowl, fried rice, fish pho soup, and crispy fried seafood noodle. Everything was delicious but the service left something to be desired. 

The food, without a doubt, is some of the best Vietnamese available in the area (right next to Saigon Pho), however, the service we received makes me hesitant to return. We did come pretty late on Sunday evening around 7:30pm so that might be a factor."}
{"text":"A great place to go try authentic Vietnamese food! Check out their street food items. Some are truly authentic items you would not find in other Vietnamese restaurants in Arizona. Must try! Great prices as well. 

Lam was a great host! The cook in the back was very nice and welcoming ."}
{"text":"Water was decent and the workers were friendly.

Everything else was intolerable and the food was inedible."}
{"text":"The old \"MAX\" is gone, now the new one serves Vietnamese food. First to try \"Pho\" but Ouch! My body was in shock due to MSG/sodium overdosed!"}
{"text":"This is the worst excuse for Vietnamese food ever. Terrible service.

Terrible service...my food came out after everyone else had finished their meals.

You can't screw up Bun Bo Hue. They screwed up Bun Bo Hue. Tried to order items on the menu and the server said, 'sorry, the person who cooks that dish isn't working right now'. Ludicrous.

Chicken wings tasted old. Street corn tasted like it came off the street. Literally. Their egg rolls were obviously frozen prior - you can get better egg rolls from Costco. And they'll not only taste better, but be served in a timely manner.

There are better Vietnamese food establishments to eat at within 5 minutes. Drive the extra distance. Avoid this place if you respect Vietnamese food.

Lastly...the owner came up to our table at the end of the meal and openly argued with me about this very post. Unfortunately, there were no other guests to witness. Must be a reason this restaurant is empty on a Saturday night during the dinner rush.

I have lived in Arizona for more than 20 years and I've eaten at many Vietnamese food establishments. I am Vietnamese myself. This is not Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Great foodand great service. Pho tastes excellent. The noodles were good and just great as the food in California. Yum."}
{"text":"I don't understand the 4 star reviews.  The fried rice was so-so.  They left out the rice to go with the bo luc lac, which was ok but not much there and the peppers were hardly cooked."}
{"text":"I do not hesitate to give 5 stars here.  Everything I have tried has the freshness, attention to detail, and quality you expect from a great restaurant.  

The location is in a generic no -frills strip mall classifying it as a \"hole-in-the-wall\" , but it would make a good casual date night spot too because the quality is clearly here to impress someone :) I'll be a regular here!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Pho places in Arizona!!! Just opened 4 months ago, friendly owners, authentic and so much flavor.  Owners are from Little Saigon Portion size fills you up but you just can't stop eating it even though you're full. Must stop in an try it! Definitely worth your time and money and your belly will appreciate it too. We will be back! Not a fancy restaurant, but with the taste of the food, decor does doesn't matter. Don't miss out on this hidden gem."}
{"text":"These guys were awesome, and the lady at the front has great customer service skills. They would get 5 stars if their portions were a bit bigger."}
{"text":"Loved the curry. It has a smoky flavor. The restaurant could use some updating and there were no napkins in the restroom but we enjoyed the food a lot. The staff is super courteous as well."}
{"text":"This is one of the top 5 places in the valley !! and they have Buen ba hue,, 

I had the Quang Zhou Fried Rice, very fresh ingredients, rice cooked perfectly, and they are using the right chinese sausage and the shrimp even tastes better than most places.. 

Wife got the Bún bò Hu adn again this was awesome. My wife noticed the missing pork blood, but they informed us about maricopa county specs that dont allow in the area, which we get since we dealt with Maricopa county before... 

Prices are excellent and some of the best for what you get.. The restaurant and staff were informative and VERY friendly,, Like we've known them for years,,, Great food.."}
{"text":"I hate giving low stars to places. Our server was friendly and the woman cook that came out was very nice. But the food just wasn't good. My husband and I were excited to see a new Viet place open up in Chandler so we had to give it a try. The pictures looked delish. We didn't eat all day to prepare to try a few things. Also the prices were low so why not indulge a little. 
We started with egg rolls and spring rolls. The spring rolls were warm. Not something I expected because they're supposed to be cool and refreshing. The dipping sauce was a watered down hoisin sauce with fried garlic and pickled carrots. 
Eggs rolls were hot and fresh. However full of carrots mostly. They were served with sweet Thai chili sauce. Not the traditional nuc Cham. 
Next we had the fish sauce wings and butter garlic wings. They were crispy and fried very well. The waitress said there was 6 per order but we got 5. The garlic was a little burnt so it was bitter. My guess is they were cooked in a wok. But they were okay. 
Then I ordered the rare beef salad. Reminded me of a Thai papaya salad. Just with beef. It was tasty but too much red onion. 
Now main dish! How we had room, I don't know. But I ordered the pho and he ordered the vermicelli noodles with pork add beef. 
I have pretty high standards with pho because my mom always made it growing up. I understand everyone makes it differently.  This place was definitely different. There was a yellowish film around the bowl. The broth was a different flavor than I'm used to. I was glad I ordered the beef on the side because the meat was super tough. Different quality of beef because even the rare beef on the side was really had to eat and chewy. 
Had a few bites and was done. Oh and the salt, wow. Way too much salt. I felt my fingers and toes swelling up before we left. 
The noodle bowl looked good. However they need to chop the meat up into edible pieces. My husband constantly had to pick the meat out with his hands and eat it caveman style. 
So In the end. The prices are low. But the food just misses the mark. Service was great. Our waitress was nice.  One last thing that bothered me, once everyone was done cooking and serving our food, all the staff was seated in the main dining area. I've seen this at plenty of other places and they're eating their dinner or what not. That's fine. But they were just chatting and blaring videos on their phones. I mean isn't there a back room for that? We never got refills. They were just too busy after bringing us food. Then my husband had to go up
To pay since no one brought us our check. 
They just opened. So they have time to improve."}
{"text":"I was in a hurry so only had a chance to try the pho here and I LOVED it. The broth, which to me is the most important part of pho, is AMAZING!!! The staff is very friendly. I look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"The times they're open and have people inside them working when I showed up is 1 out of 4 times now. Their hours are irregular and even when you show up during business hours they were closed. The first time I tried them was the only time I got to go inside and eat. The place is not the tidiest place and they had employees family members much hanging out in the dining area the whole time. Food was good enough and the price was fair. The owner of this place needs to take a class in restaurant management."}
{"text":"Service was great and food was very good. They are flexible on dietary restrictions and modify preparation of dishes as needed. I would go back."}
{"text":"The crab noodles here are delicious and made with real crab. 

Can definitely taste the difference. 

Looking forward to trying the bun bo hue next time!"}
{"text":"\"I won't be impressed with technology until I can download food.\"

After a long Saturday with a small lunch, I was ready for something hearty for dinner. And since it was raining, why not get some beef stew?

I've been wanting to try this place for a while and I think everyone else was thinking the same because it was ridiculously busy. Babies were fussing, the lack of any decoration or music only amplifying the high-pitched cries, and the poor waitress was working her butt off trying to bus tables, seat people, take orders, and serve. The wait time was hefty.

The food was good though. The beef stew had much flavor and I soaked up every last drop of broth with my bread. The carrots were soft, the onions were sweet, and the beef cubes were massive and tender. The broth for the pho was very clean and had a strong lemongrass flavor. I recommend passing on their egg rolls because they're super small but the spring rolls were great. They go stingy on the veggies for pho too  and the lettuce with the egg rolls were laughable. They're even smaller than their mini egg rolls.

If you got time to waste and don't mind waiting for your food, this is a pretty good local business. 3.5 stars but I'll bump it to a 4 because their menu is impressive. There's something for everybody here."}
{"text":"I'm not Vietnamese but I ate enough Vietnamese food with my husband and in laws. This place is no good. With my pregnant taste buds, I can tell the chicken wings are super old, tofu is sour already. I stopped eating after I tasted everyone's dish because I didn't want to feed my baby this food. 
If you need good recommendations, here are some better choices for you: pho chandler, pho dam which is next to LeeLee Market and other pho places in Mekong. Check those out."}
{"text":"Food is great !!!! love the spring rolls with avocado!!!!!!"}
{"text":"No AC so it was hot, sticky and uncomfortable in the restaurant (it is summer). Should have left, but it is close-by and I wanted a good pho option. This is not it. 

The broth was tepid so the noodles had a weird texture, because they didn't soften in the broth. 

The service was off, we waited a really long time for pho when there was only one other table in the restaurant. I never got the iced tea even though I asked twice. 

Not anything I'll repeat."}
