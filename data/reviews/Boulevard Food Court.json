{"text":"Great service and yummy food!! Spoke to Mike Lee general manager, cool guy!!"}
{"text":"The chili chese fries where subpar unfilling and overpriced. The staff was rude and inattentive. They carded me for soda. They took forever to get my food out. It was one of the worst dinning exsperiences ive ever had and I shall not be returning anytime in the forseeable future"}
{"text":"This place opened up right next to my work and there are so many good things to eat there. There's Mexican food there's hot dogs,  pizza,  chicken wings, ice cream, coffee, etc... it's a good place for tourists to go to not spend a lot of money because it's not located inside of pricey casinos.

Update. 7/28/17 There's only Mexican food and pizza now. I heard a Pink Box doughnut shop is opening soon. We will see.."}
{"text":"I had the Philly and a friend of mine had the nachos and both were amazing!!! Perfect late night snack especially with them being open 24 hours and a little further down the strip than the food court by MGM! A ton of verity and Mike lee the GM is awesome and has the most personable personality out there! Thank you to him! Go try it out!"}
{"text":"Great food court- the service is unreal and the food is fresh at a good price! Highly recommend!"}

~delicious tacos
~interesting doughnuts!

I was so excited to find the new Boulevard Food Court.  Its literally less than a ten minute walk from my room at the Grand Chateau until I'm ordering!  They are open 24 hours!  This is fantastic.

Inside you will find a pizza place, a donut shop and El Dorado Express.  There is another food place as well, but it was closed when I was there, so not sure if it is the process of opening, changing, closing or what.  The food court has indoor and outdoor covered seating.  There are restrooms there, accessible with a code that comes on your receipt.

El Dorado Express is an offshoot of El Dorado Cantina which is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas in my opinion so I was excited to try it out.  They have a good sized menu, but its about the tacos!  Yelp check ins get you a free taco and on Tuesdays street tacos are $2 each.

I had one carnitas taco, one cochinita taco and one al pastor taco.  They were all yummy and I cannot pick between the al pastor and the cochinita for my favorite... they both had delicious elements.  

I also tried some donuts in a middle of the night sugar crave and they were really good!

Overall, I see myself coming here pretty much every time I'm in Vegas.  I highly recommend it as an affordable place to eat a quick meal.  Seriously, the tacos."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! The food is authentic and they have many different choices to satisfy any craving! The manager Mike and an employee named Hunter were especially nice so if you see them, you're definitely in good hands! I tried the cactus tacos which sounds a bit odd but 10/10 recommend :)) -Aria"}
{"text":"Love El Dorado Cantina's restaurant on Industrial. I was happy to hear about this location with a smaller menu on the strip. Tacos are so good, and they have authentic cochinita pibil. The elote was juicy and flavorful.  

Also loved the options for different choices nearby. We tried the carnita fries from Mighty Fries, and they were really flavorful. I really liked the seating inside or outside, and best part was I could get a refreshing iced tea from Coffee Bean...all in the same place! I will definitely go back next time I go to the strip. 

Only suggestion, put in a high quality ice cream place and no one will need to leave ever."}
{"text":"Food court that is open 24 hours....Amen! What more could you ask for at 2 in the morning? All other restaurants were closed in the casino. You had option from Chinese food to American food. If you've been drinking and forget to eat, come to this food court.
Also, 5 stars to the security guard that helped a homeless man get water."}
{"text":"This food court is very clean, nice and hip. I must say, VERY CLEAN!!! They have many TV's to watch sports and tables to relax and eat. It's right next to MGM, so it's very easy to walk to if you're staying there. So far I've tried Mighty Fries and Cannonball Wings. Love them both! I had the Spicy Sriracha Hawaiian Fries and the Chicken Wings with Buffalo Carolina Reaper Sauce. The fries are so delicious!!! It has Spam and a pouched egg. LOVE IT!!!! Also, the Wings are spicy! I heard Eldorado Express is really good too, but I didn't get a chance to eat there. Maybe next time...."}
{"text":"So many options to choose from, staff are bomb and food is amazing! 10/10. Tacos are my fav try the pork"}
{"text":"This is a decent food court conveniently located on the strip.  There isn't much seating inside but plenty outside if you don't mind sitting there.  Or you can grab your food and go.  There are several options to choose from, including Mexican, pizza, coffee, etc., so you should be able to find something to satisfy. Some are even open 24 hours. We tried the tacos from El Dorado Express and while they had a high rating at the time, we found the wait to be too long and the food was subpar.  I'd opt for something else.  Luckily, there are plenty of affordable options."}
{"text":"Clean place inside and outside seating and plenty of food choices. Great value for your money. I will go back anytime. Place is open 24 hrs from what I understand so whether to check for breakfast lunch dinner or late night munchies you are good! 
Very clean place professional and friendly staff with very quick service. Walking distance to many hotels on Vegas strip South. Give them a try. Of course I went for the tacos. Smallish tacos decent prices on each. This is Vegas strip most tacos are on that ballpark price. If want cheaper off strip is your option. Pizza prices were good too.  I had cochinita which is orange and spices marinated slow cooked pork. Cabeza which is cow head smooth tender meat and pastor which is grilled marinated pork w pineapple bits."}
{"text":"Decent late night food! That's about all I can say. They got pretty manager lady that made it a cool ambiance! But it's late night food. Will settle that hunger late"}
{"text":"El Dorado Express has great tacos! The prices are cheap $2.50 per taco. The food court is clean and right in between all the action on the strip. Al Pastor taco is the best."}
{"text":"Liberating El Dorado Cantina from Sapphire's and bringing Pink Box Doughnuts to the 40,000,000+ yearly visitors to Las Vegas is in no way a bad thing, and doing it 24/7 is an added bonus that immediately makes Boulevard Food Court one of the best choices for all-day dining on the Strip.

{"text":"Eldorado Express is so delicious and fresh their tacos are super worth it they cook the food right in front of you I don't believe I've had any tacos as good as these on the strip definitely worth it"}
