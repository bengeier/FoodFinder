{"text":"Good start to any restaurant experience: I couldn't decide what to order! I came here for brunch and there were a good number of options, ranging from savoury to sweet, that all sounded delicious.
After asking the opinion of our server, I decided on the indian duck confit skillet - what a great decision! The duck was tender, and the carmelized onions gave a great sweetness that cut the saltiness of the cheddar and home fries. The fresh salsa on top was also a great addition. 
Service was fast and very friendly, and we never felt rushed. Overall: I can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a unique brunch experience give this place a try! Amazing menu with friendly staff to take care of you. 

I had the bake & saltfish and it was to die for. The mango hot sauce was hotter than I'm use to because I'm not a huge spicy fan but others might appreciate the flavourful spice. 

The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. I asked to modify my order with no cilantro and they were happy to oblige. 

If you love Caribbean food with a Canadian flare give this place a go. Next time I'll bring my Guyanese mom as she will love some of the unique items on the menu"}
{"text":"I created a yelp account specifically to make THIS review! This place has THE best fried chicken sandwich I have ever had. I know that this is a bold statement,  seeing as a fried sandwich is usually pretty basic. Not at Windup! The chicken was so juicy and the toppings were extremely complimentary, things I wouldn't normally expect to have on a fried sandwich. 
I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to spice, so I was a little hesitant when I first went in, considering this is a Caribbean restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised with the menu options as they were pretty vast. 
The staff were very accommodating and friendly.  The decor is awesome, with a giant picture of Grace Jones that I kind of want for my house..."}
{"text":"Great selection of well prepared, visually appealing and really delicious Caribbean food!  We couldn't decide on what to have for dinner, so ordered a selection of appetizers.  what a great plan!  we tried the more common dishes like coconut shrimp and lettuce falafel wraps first.. then the manager recommended some of the house specialties.  we had goat roti, octopus, Trini doubles..... everything was amazing!  finished our evening off with some really tasty desserts.  what a night!  our waitress was so sweet and friendly, the manager treats everyone like regulars - and makes you feel special.. the ambiance was fantastic and the prices were very reasonable.  definitely worth going back!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I was pretty sure I would love wind up before I went in. I remember walking by and thinking their \"We'll Jerk Anything\" sign was hilarious and that on that alone I owed it to them to give the place a try.  Wind up is a relatively upscale  take on Caribbean food - in the same vein as patois near by - but having walked by a couple of times I'd never seen it especially busy. That is going to change. It's reasonably new and is perhaps suffering from its predecessor's failure (a restaurant by the same name folded in the same location 8 months or so ago), but the new owners have done a beautiful job renovating and coming up with great new restaurant concept.  I love jerk chicken so I suppose it was only a matter of time before I went in and I was not disappointed! The jerk chicken was spicy , but manageable with a scotch bonnet hot sauce on the side to fire it up. The sides were classics: beans and rice with a delicious 'slaw on the side. I washed it down with a dark and stormy that had ginger beer in it that kicked in a way I'd never thought possible. Anyways, long review, but I was very impressed and I'll definitely go back. Best of luck to the new owners."}
{"text":"We were a group of 7 for dinner, and came to check it out for the first time since the new owners took over. The meal was excellent. I had the rundown, a veggie dish, and my wife had the jerk chicken. Both were delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went this morning (Sunday) for Brunch with 3 adults and 2 kids (age 3y and 11months). The food was excellent and interesting -- our group tried the french toast, oxtail eggs benny and bake/saltfish sandwich. Very friendly bar and wait staff. Very family friendly (clean, functional high chairs; practical kids menu, kids eat free on sunday evenings -- will be back to check this out!)"}
{"text":"Windup was a pleasant surprise. 

We made a reservation as a party of six on a Friday night and were seated indoors. The atmosphere is cute and the music was appropriate for a Caribbean themed restaurant. Our server, Brian, was very friendly and a huge help when it came to explaining the menu. 

The food was great and reasonably priced, which makes it easy to come back again. My favorite plates were actually appetizer dishes... The oxtail spring rolls and the polenta fries. Delicious! The jerk chicken was cooked perfectly, however, could have used a bit longer marinating time for deeper flavor. But not bad!

A great addition to the Kensington-College street area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The server was extremely sweet and helpful. The staff catered to a special request with no problem, and the chef came out and spoke to us! The goat roti and duck doubles are TO DIE FOR!"}
{"text":"So glad I finally made it in. Good and service were exceptional .. Very impressed and then place was completely packed. Highly recommend...."}
{"text":"Came here on a triple date with friends on a Saturday night. Staff is extremely pleasant. Service is a little slow though. We ordered the jerk wings as an appetizer they were good but nothing too amazing. For the main I got the jerk chicken plate and my husband got the steak meal. The jerk chicken was not spicy at all, I had to add a whole lot of hot sauce to it. The chicken was cooked to perfection though and plate looked very appetizing. The steak my husband had was really good, he really enjoyed it. The atmosphere was nice and they had good reggae music playing. Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Went here for birthday dinner with my fiancee and his family. We tried many of the things on the menu and they were all amazing! The jerk chicken was delicious, the Pull Up Selecta was a ton of food (they say it's for 2 it can easily feed 3) and everything in it was great. Also loved the cheesy co co fries app. The service was also friendly and helpful. This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"A group of us went to Toronto on a girls weekend and this was our favorite brunch spot. Service was fantastic and food was amazing with things you don't always see on the brunch scene (oxtail benedict and spiced rum French toast). Definitely recommend for anyone in Toronto...even if you're not staying nearby!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a friend on a Sunday. The menu looked appetizing but I was quite disappointed with the food. 

My friend and I both ordered a special juice they were serving that morning - with spinach, kale, mango and peach. Although we were told it was a juice, it was more of a smoothie with chunks of the spinach and kale still intact. While it was still tasty, I would have liked to know whether it was a juice vs smoothie. 

I ordered the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon while my friend had the jerk chicken and waffles. I was very disappointed with this dish - it was drenched in a heavy white sauce that made it difficult to finish. The scrambled eggs were salty and served on hash browns that had too many spices. There was also barely any smoked salmon on my plate. Unfortunately the only saving grace was the arugula side salad but that was also drenched in the dressing. My friend was also disappointed with the jerk chicken that he could not finish it - there was way too much syrup on the waffles (which already had a lot of sugar in the batter). 

The service was decent, as our waiter was friendly and helpful. While we were there, we were told that those sitting on the patio may have to move inside due to wasps, so keep this in mind if you are looking for a patio brunch."}
{"text":"Saw this resto featured on TV. Took our friends for brunch. It was amazing. The staff were great and the chef and owner treated us like royalty. I definitely will be going back soon. We ordered the rum soaked French toast, Oxtail Benedict and Cornmeal Waffle and Jerk Chicken. The flavours, quality and experience were beyond our expectations. We had Sorrel ( drink ) , and the brownie and bread pudding dessert. They both were tasty and unique. Congrats to the owners and well done!"}
{"text":"Everything was full of flavour... Prices are just right... try the pork belly and butter tart... the mac and cheese and jerked pork was delicious... a Summerlicious Must-do..."}
{"text":"I found out about this restaurant through Summerlicious. The menu seemed intriguing and the prices were fair. They also have a full bar and serve a large selection of specialty rum. 

The appetizer was my favourite part of this 3 course meal. I ordered the Doubles with curried chana filling. SO GOOD. It was a marriage of delicious savoury flavours with just enough spice.

If I were to visit again, I would not order the Jerked pork loin. It was not what we had expected, the meat did not taste flavoured. We didn't taste any pepper or spice. It was served on a bed of creamy coconut rice n' peas, this was sweet and delectable. I'm used to having coleslaw on the side, so the green beans were a disappointing substitute. Also, there was no gravy on this dish. My bias for having Caribbean food at Ritz / Rasta pasta though.  

The dessert was presented on a warm cast-iron pan. The ice cream and chocolate melted just perfectly on the caramelized butter tart. I loved the ice cream-- you could taste the rum!

3.5/5 It was a nice experience, but I wouldn't go out of my way to re-visit.

Tip: Make reservations before coming! They may refuse walk-ins."}
{"text":"It's a shame that there isn't more foot traffic in the area because The Wind-Up is actually so worth checking out! This cursed location has been home to about three different businesses in my five years here in Toronto, but I'm really hoping this one sticks. This restaurant classifies itself as Caribbean, specifically Trinidadian cuisine. I'm Trini so it takes a lot to impress me and everything downtown has been far from impressive until now. The thing I like most about this fairly new restaurant is that it's inventive. They take trini classics and put a modern twist on them, and the result is pretty tasty!

The Wind-up first strikes you as different from all the other Caribbean restaurants because it's a lot more upscale than the typical corner store roti shop. The interior is clean and filled with Carnival masks, funky art, and cool steelpan lighting fixtures. 


Our Order:
Drinks: Rum Punch, their home-brewed Iced Tea
Appetizers: Grilled Octopus, Cheesey Coo Coo Fries, Doubles w/Duck, and Ox Tail Spring Rolls
Main: Jerk Chicken meal

Service was great. We received our drinks almost straight away. Rum Punch was the stand-out here. The perfect sort of drink to go with the hot Toronto weather we've been having. 

Appetizers were fun and tasty. Standout: Cheesy Coo Coo fries, a deep-fried polenta-esque dish. Soft and fluffy on the inside and light and crispy on the outside. The accompanying sauce was spicy but good. Another standout: Grilled Octopus- bed of quinoa with fruit and caramelized peanuts- great textures together. 

The Jerk Chicken was the main reason why we decided to try the Wind-Up in the first place. The serving is huge, can easily feed two people. The chicken is tender and flavourful and comes on a bed of rice with a small serving of beans and coleslaw. The entire dish was cooked perfectly and tasted extremely fresh. The chicken isn't as \"jerky\" as I'm normally used to. It tastes more like a really great BBQ chicken. Of course we were mostly stuffed from the appetizers so we took most of it to go, but it was equally great the next day too. 

All in all this place is awesome. The atmosphere is chill and it's still enough of a hole-in-the-wall that it's never crowded. Service is great and food is very memorable. If you're into trini food or just want to try I couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"I went here for Summerlicious. I had a roti, pork loin, and a tart with ice cream. There's really nice decor, definitely felt the Jamaican vibes. The roti was pulled kind of like pulled pork except it was goat meat I think? It was also much smaller than your regular roti, which is fine as it was an app but it wasn't that good. The main was yummy. I thought the jerk pork could have used more spice but the rice? Honestly the best rice and peas I've ever had. HIGHLY recommend. The desert was sweet and satisfying. It was the perfect size and I can definitely say I left satisfied. I will be back."}
{"text":"The group I went with were impressed with the menu from the start. The food did not disappoint. I probably had the best French toast I've ever had - I didn't even need maple syrup (it was available though). My friend had the jerk chicken & waffle, and was very pleased after going to a rather lacklustre \"Jamaican\" restaurant the night before.

The service was excellent too!"}
{"text":"I pass by this place every time I go to Voodoo Child, and it always looks so exciting and fun when I look inside and wondered if their food was the same.

I finally got to visit this place on a Thursday night. It wasn't busy at all. There were just 2 other tables filled up. The ambience has a African/Caribbean theme. The restaurant played awesome Socca music in the background which was cool. You do not hurt socca playing enough in bars, clubs and restaurants...at least the ones that I got to. Its so fun and uplifting. 

I had the Oxtail Burger which was juicy and not over cook. I was expecting a full on Oxtail burger, but that's not what it was :(
It was a beef burger and in the centre was an oxtail filling. I wish I knew I wasn't getting much \"Caribbean food\" out of this order because I would have ordered the Jerk Chicken with coconut rice which also looked delicious.

The restaurant was clean and the service was very friendly. I'd love to come back totry their brunch menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service.  I've come her a few times now but I will focus on my first time having brunch. I came with a friend on a Saturday. The service was very quick and attentive.  I ordered the Oxtail Benny and my friend order a fried chicken sandwich. Everything on the menu looked good and slightly unique from what you would get at other restaurants.

The Oxtail was served on a coconut bake instead of a regular English muffin, it sounded a bit odd but I like trying new things.  It was such a great combination.  It made the heaviness of the meat and hollandaise sauce lighter, a very nice balance.  The combination of flavors was very unique and very satisfying.  

I'm always picky when it comes to home fries, I hate when restaurants serve ones you can tell were from the freezer and then don't season them at all.  These were nice and fresh and flavourful.  My friend really enjoyed her sandwich.  

I have been back for drinks and a couple more meals.   I think this is a great addition to College street, something different amongst the Italian restaurants, tex-mex, sushi, and pubs.  Can't wait to keep trying out new things on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I had the Oxtail Burger which was great and my girlfriend had the jerk chicken and she loved it. We had the doubles for starters and it was very well made. The Sorrel was very good. What was amazing was that the owner who did not grow up in the culture was actually the one who learned how to make it so I was very impressed. Staff made the experience that much more welcoming. Would definitely go back to eat there and have drinks."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious and loved the chickpea doubles they had in the appetizer selections. If I had to visit again, I would just have this with a drink.. However, the mains didn't really stand out much to me.. I had their fish option and my boyfriend ordered the jerk with rice and peas. The fish was cooked well, but we felt like his jerk plate was missing a few flavours.. The servers were nice, but service that day was mediocre.. I felt like our server forgot about our drink orders as we had to flag them down a few times to remind them of our orders and for water.. and then we were brought other people's appetizers during or meal.. 

I wouldn't write them off though as the atmosphere seemed pretty chill and I'd like to try the items on their regular menu like the doubles."}
{"text":"This might be hard to hear - but the new Windup restaurant is only as half decent as the previous Windup Cafe.
First of all, the menu lacks of diversity & option for the food (which is really different to the previous Windup Cafe). My partner, who's a vegan (blehhh to her), had a really hard time to find any option in our visit. We told the waiter about our situation, so he recommended us the french toast (the only vegetarian dish)...and well, it had brie cheese on it. Not only the restaurant did not have any vegan option, but it was also not a good idea to put brie cheese on the French toast. Believe me, it tasted odd.
Second, my dish kind of disappointed me as well. I ordered the jerk chicken corn waffles because it was recommended by the restaurant, but it did not impress me in any way. Although it was interesting how the chief garnished the dish with orange peels, the waffle was TOO sweet. As for the jerk chicken, it was a bit too greasy & salty. It was unfortunate how the taste did not match up together at the end. (Honestly, I don't understand why are everything we ordered really salty & sweet at the same time.)

I really want to give this place another chance since Windup Cafe was one of my favourite restaurants... I also hope they can bring the old menu back."}
{"text":"The food there is amazing. It is truly a fusion of world, Canadian and Caribbean cuisine unite. 

Great service and will recommend it. Love the place"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a week night and had a great experience. Our server was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The food service was slow, but in a good way that left us with plenty of time to enjoy a beautiful evening on the patio accompanied by good conversation and a tasty meal.

The resto has a full bar with a refreshing drinks menu featuring craft & Caribbean beers, and Caribbean inspired cocktails. The food menu was limited to a handful of apps and mains. I think this was a smart choice on the chef's part; it's much better to do a few things well than to try and do a bunch of things mediocrely. For apps we tried the curried goat roti, the coconut shrimp and the grilled octopus. Everything looked and tasted amazing! Seriously, A+ for presentation here! The roti was flaky and delicious, the goat was so tender!, and the curry flavour was well balanced. The octopus had a great meaty texture. I didn't personally taste the shrimp due to an allergy, but I wish I could've they looked so darn appetizing!!  

As my main I had the salmon, which was served with a veggie medley and spinach dumplings. The best part was the sauce. Oh, that creamy, coconutty sauce....  So yummy! I also sampled the oxtail burger, which was perfectly cooked and served on tasty egg bun. The burger, by the way, was served with salad AND fries, with both mayo and ketchup for dipping. So whatever your preference, you're covered. Another member of our party ordered the Jerk Chicken, which I did not taste, but he described as \"mild\". 

We finished with complimentary desert, as our server was regretful she spent enough time with our table. The gesture was appreciated of course (who turns down free desert?!), but was completely unnecessary. Aside from the fact that we sat ourselves, our server did everything right: we all got our food at the same time, warm, with no errors. She stopped to a few times during the meal to see if we were enjoying ourselves, and she was there to offer more drinks and refill our water as needed. Well done! In case you were wondering, desert was a chocolate brownie served with peanut gelato,  and a no-bake cheese served with roasted peaches. TO DIE FOR.

Based on our experience with the Jerk and the Curried Goat, our table concluded that this is definitely Caribbean Fusion, with the key word here being 'Fusion'. The dishes are inspired by Caribbean flavours, but the spice is definitely toned down. All in all, a great food and a great experience. I would go back with friends, family, or on a date."}
