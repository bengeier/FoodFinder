{"text":"I ate here once while staying in Canada for awhile. I loved it. 

CHEAP. 5 dollars? Yes. Also the portion sizes were pretty sizable.

FOOD IS DELICIOUS. Authentic, delicious, hot Chinese food. Yess. 

Environment, okay yeaah it's kinda greasy. But hey. 

Fast service. Yes.

OVerall, a great place to get some cheap and delicious fast Chinese food. Wish I had one of of these in California."}
{"text":"Salty pork fried rice is an orgasm in yo mouth. Spicy salty but not too crusty, and the rice isn't salty like most of the restaurants at Dixie Park. It perfectly compliments the pork and they give you enough to feed a clown family"}
{"text":"Rice with shrimp and lobster sauce was so good. Nothing too special but that's what I liked about it. Good dish if you are starving and need rice to fill you up quick. Little spicey....so make sure you request according to your spice scale....

Portion was good. At $5.50 it was very cheap. 

The place is inside a small mall so expect to be a little noisy, it's a food court. 

I will definitely visit the place again on another hungry day."}
{"text":"My family and I, wanted something quick and no waiting for tables. So we stopped by at the food court. The food was good and quite cheap for what they offered.  The cashier was friendly. The food court, the restaurant, well, I didn't expect much from the start anyway.

We ordered ..rice shrimp dish,  beef rice noodles (only three small pieces of beef), and seafood chow mein."}
{"text":"We were waiting for her to get off the phone for about 10 minutes when she took the time to tell us to order elsewhere , as  we were taking too long to order ?!?.and she got back on the phone .  Apparently they were busy filling other orders but i could not believe there was no apology and she blamed us instead . A guy waiting for his food for 20 minutes[  he told me] , expressed shock too . i think i have lived in this city to see stuff like that happen but man that was brutal ."}
{"text":"Good value and delicious food. I come all the time and get the two can dine. Lots of parking. Pretty clean.  Sometimes packed on busy times. Overall awesome.

No wifi here"}
{"text":"I love this fast food restaurant so much. The food they make is so so so delicious. My favourite is salty pepper pork chops with fried rice. It tastes so good. I have been getting this order so many times and I still love it. Don't remember how many times I have bought food from them. Very good price with large portions. The lady taking the orders is polite. I will go back again and again and again lol..."}
{"text":"Food is soooo good for sooooo cheap.

This is my go to fast food Chinese spot when I'm in the area. 

They have combos where you can get 2 items for $11.50, 3 for $16.50, 4 for $21.50 or 5 for $26.50. So cheap and it comes with rice so you do not jave to order it. As well the 2 item combo is good enough to feed a family of 4 easily with food left over. I have never gone over a 3 item combo it's just too much food.

Their party trays are really cheap and a life/time saver when you have large amounts of people over, average price for a large party tray is $25 and up but well worth it. 6 party trays was roughly under $200 and it easily feeds 50 plus people trust me I know. Just call ahead and set a time for pickup and there you go your food is ready.

Lastly, Karen the main person at the front is awesome. She is very helpful when you can't decide on what to get. Just tell her what your craving and let her choose for you, so far she hasn't let me down.

Items to definitely get

-cantonese chow mein
-deep fried spicy squid
-fish in corn sauce
-deep fried shrimp
-shanghai beef noodles"}
{"text":"I always choose this place out of all the other 7 restaurants in Dixie Park! Although the the its neighbor( not the pho place) is quite similar... I've always chose this place. I have no clue why.

Their price is dirt cheap! I ordered fried chicken with rice, pork chop with rice, a side order of chili salted squid, honeydew bbt, and 2 pop =22.00 with tax included! 

The cashier has been there forever and so as her green eyeshadow! She's friendly but I've heard other people say she was rude. 

The food was salty, crispy, and super tasty! I do love myself some cheap quick chinese food. The pork chop, chicken and squid were all very crispy and had this cooked onion with garlic and chili topping with chopped green onions. We just got plain rice with it and the bbt was pretty good, sweet and creamy.

If your craving for chinese food and your thinking cheap then treat yo self!"}
{"text":"My parents and I have been visiting the Dixie Park Food Court, and specifically Lemongrass Kitchen, for years. And for the last 15 years, absolutely nothing has changed about this place - the consistently delicious, greasy-in-the-best-way-possible, comfort food, the casual food court style atmosphere and decor, and quick and easy service. Don't let the semi-shabby setting fool you - this place is a very popular west end haven for quick and dirty (in the best way) Asian food court fare.

90% of the time, we choose Lemongrass Kitchen in this food court (note: it's also normally the one with the longest lineup). Here's a rundown:

Portion Size: Honestly, a dish here could feel a small army (exaggerated, but you know what I mean). Very generous portion sizes, and I always have leftovers.

Price: Average prices for dishes (many in combination with a soup or rice), is around $5.00 to $6.00.

Popular Items: Spicy Fried Pork Chop on Fried Rice (crunchy with a kick!), Sizzling Plate #6 (noodles in black bean sauce), Spicy Fried Tofu, Spicy Fried Chicken Wings (salty and crunchy, and great texture!), among many, many others.

Party Trays: We've ordered from this place many times when we needed to feed an army for a family party, and prices are very reasonable. We've also called the day of, and there's never any hesitation when you require a  party tray with last minute notice (i.e. \"Hey Karen, can I have a Large tray of chicken wings in an hour?\" \"Yep, sure. Will be here. See you then.\")
  
Other Notes: They also sell XL sized bubble tea for $2.50 (in Taro, Coconut, Mango, and Green Apple)."}
{"text":"Cheap and Delicious!!!

My husband, a white guy introduced me, an asian to this place 6 years ago and it is our go-to-feel-good-full-out-of-your-mind-delicious Chinese food. When he first took me here, I was thinking...he just took me to tiny-pacific-mall-of-Mississauga for food, what the hell?!

This place is in an industrial area and in a small mall with a bunch of food stalls. It is like a hole in the wall type of place but beats a lot of the big Chinese restaurants. We never sit there because it's not really a restaurant place but random tables in the hallway. It is always busy though. There are several food courts there but by far Lemongrass is the best one. We only buy from Lemongrass. 

The lady in the front shop is really friendly. She always say see you tomorrow when we purchase food there. She talks so quickly but never ever makes a mistake. 

Some of our favourite dishes are: sambal shrimps, black pepper beef +/- noodles, yeung chow fried rice, green beans (best green beans ever!), sweet and sour pork. They have a lot of selection though.

I've hosted several birthday parties and baby showers and have ordered their party platters before. Guests were full and happy. Super cheap too. For 180$ at one time, it fed 25 people with a ton of left over for everyone to take home. Another time for $115, I fed 15 people and then they have to take it home because there were just too much food remained. 

Super quick, delicious, yet super cheap food. 

Highly recommend!"}
