{"text":"This place is garbage. I was standing outside in the pouring rain with my baby and my dog and this guy wasn't even open. I tried to take cover in his doorway and he knocked on the door as to tell me I couldn't stand there. What an asshole."}
{"text":"Today the food was extremely salty my husband wasted money buying two meals and my son bought one, all in the garbage."}
{"text":"There service could use some work. Always call in your order because you'll be there all day if you don't. I always get a wing snack pack.. there fries are seasoned and battered.. the reason why I still eat there."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the good was awesome. But had the Worst experience as my order took one hour and 8 mins and was promised my meal in under 35 min! Please work on your ordering system that you use with Uber as this is the only reason I gave you a 3. You blamed Uber and Uber blames you. As a customer it's just not v"}
{"text":"This place was good. Friendly service. I got the Pork chops smothered, greens and cabbage. every thing was fresh. greens were a tad salty, but good. sampled the Mac and cheese it was fantastic."}
{"text":"The food is tasty overall. Well seasoned and a good portion size for the price. I had a perch dinner and the fish was cooked a little too long, but not enough to call it trash. Same for the standard cornbread muffin. I called ahead and it still took longer than the quoted time. So pack your patience. I would give it another go."}
{"text":"Took way to long and the cake was triple layers although there is enough ice and on it for one layer and that's Lights cost at $4 I would say I would try it again but I definitely wouldn't get the Polish boy because I have some kind of sweet bun don't kind of go with Polish boy or sauce the people were friendly but I was there for an hour waiting for 15 chicken wings and they have a deep fryer so I said cak.e wasn't great and there was not nearly enough ice and for all that cake"}
