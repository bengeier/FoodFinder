{"text":"This place is delicious!  I came into town for work and was searching for a healthy meal and found this amazing spot!  The customer service is fantastic and the chef made the best chicken energy bowl ever!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ok, here I go again...this is a fantastic place! Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful service. Seriously, they are all so nice in here. And the food...so fresh and so amazing. Portions are the right size and healthy! I have had the grilled chicken energy bowl - it was great, seasoned chicken and vegetables. The 5K salad - this is truly an amazing salad. I can't do it justice with my words, just go try it...now! And, the flatbread chicken avocado melt - um, YUMMY! The Hybrid Punch is really tasty too. Sometimes the wait can be a bit long so do yourself a favor and order ahead if you are on a lunch break. But, do not EVER let that stop you from coming here! Prices are a bit more than you are going to pay at some places but, hands down - it is worth it! When you want really good food that is good for you...go here!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Ordered the Black Bean Burger and Green Machine Smoothie. Both were amazing! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to Hybrid Fit Food for the first time today and ordered the Cobb salad with chicken. The salad was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place twice now and each tome they  never got around to making my order.  They sure are great about taking my money though"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying there needs to be more places like this. The location is fine, across from a crossfit gym so I would say that could be a VERY smart move in terms of business. I will also make mention that the wait for my food was a little long but it seemed rather busy so I didn't mind. I ordered 1 turkey slider and 1 chicken slider with light mayo, a bowl of turkey chili and a bottle of water ~$11 not too bad for quality food with decent macronutrients. Turkey slider was better than the chicken in my opinion, both had cheese and lettuce, I could've done without the cheese to try and save myself some fat intake. They both came on Hawaiian king sweet rolls which was amazing. Meat was cooked nicely, excellent seasoning, little spicy which was great for me. Turkey chili was also VERY tasty! It had a nice little kick of spice, it also had pineapple which was a super tasty spin! Only recommendation would be more turkey in the chili but otherwise excellent. Will be back to try the smoothies and chicken wraps."}
{"text":"While visiting Champaign, I found this cafe on accident.  I'm so glad I did. The food was excellent and service was great!! I had the flavorful turkey burger and chicken taco.  Both were exceptional.  I will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Since we moved to Latitude, we wanted to try all the local restaurants nearby, and Hybrid Fit Food was one on my mind. Went here for lunch and had the BBQ Flatbread and the Caribbean Smoothie. The flatbread came out pipping hot and generous portions of chicken, but the best part was that I was eating a healthy flatbread that wasn't covered in grease! Their prices are very reasonable for a healthy meal or snack post-workout, and I would recommend ordering the BBQ Flatbread! Also, the lady who served us was extremely friendly and genuine, which I give credits to this small business for being so polite. She insisted that I did not have to put my plate away, that she would take care of it and to have a nice weekend.  Overall, I plan on coming here every time I need a healthy fix without the greasy regrets of having to burn it off!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food is amazing. Perfectly seasoned!  Some of my favs are: broccoli cheese soup, energy bowl, southwest chicken salad. But really you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
