{"text":"Last night I stopped in at the Jerk Spot to try out their rotis and was very happy with this new neighbourhood place.  The space is tiny, bright and immacculate, with just a few seats for eating in.  I got take out:  a potato/chickpea roti that was large enough to save some for breakfast, and very tasty, not too spicy.  The best thing was the price - a mere $6.50 including tax.   Also, the people working there were super friendly and the service was very speedy."}
{"text":"Living in the King West area, I was excited when this Jerk Spot opened up. On my way home from work one night I decided to stop in and grab a Curry Chicken Roti. I have been craving a good Roti and to be honest, I havent found one comparable to Kori's Roti Stop in Oakville. Unfortunately I STILL have not found one as great as Kori's.   I will say that I agree with other reviewers that some of the staff are very friendly and the price is right when it comes to quick take out. Dont get me wrong, the Roti is not terrible and I will definitely get it again, but there was something lacking. Perhaps it was the fact that it only took them 3 minutes to produce my Roti. Im use to waiting a good 10 - 15 minutes before its been made.   I found the Roti to be better earlier in the day for by night time my shell was thick and almost hard on the ends where you have extra shell. Perhaps the Rotis are already made and just warming in the back? If thats the case, Id like to see the Jerk Spot display a counter up front where they put your Roti together in front of you. I like seeing you warm up my Roti shell and stuff it for me :)  My boyfriend ordered the Jerk Chicken dinner a few weeks ago and said it was average. I tried the Roti again hoping my \"average\" was a one off but no....still average.   I will try it again since its so conveniently close to my condo and its better than eating McDonald's or other fast food restaurants when you dont feel like cooking. Hopefully it will get better or I might have to take a longer trek up to Island Foods."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst place I've been to I go to school across the street and they have the worst quality food. I bought their festive poutine it was chopped up bread with jerk sauce that shit gave me food poisoning  and I couldn't stop shitting for 3 days"}
{"text":"I feel bad writing this as the staff were so friendly. I'm not the expert on Caribbean food (only been to Jamaica once) but the Roti was gross with hard bits of something in it and it tasted like it was dropped in a campfire. I tossed it in the garbage. The Jamaican patties were like something you find at a 7/11 with next to zero meat in it, obviously not made fresh (costco maybe).  Also bought Jerk Chicken which was okay but I've made better at home.... from a jar.   I spent almost $30 because I LOVE Caribeen food but I'll keep going to Island Foods. Sorry Jerk Spot :("}
{"text":"Please please please do not be fooled by the vibrant red, yellow and greens of the Jamaican flag splashed upon the front of this  establishment seemingly beckoning you in.  Your mind will inevitably associate them with melodic reggae music and spicy soulful Caribbean cooking known the world over for tantalizing taste buds, and 9/10 times this association is valid.  The Jerk Spot is a definite exception.   Like many others reviewing The Jerk Spot I do feel a tad guilty about slamming it so as the staff are fantastic.  Yet even the best staff known to man can't save this place from the unpalatable monstrosities that they try to pass off as Caribbean cuisine.  First off the fetid smell that assails your nostrils upon entering can gently be described as a combination of bleach, excrement and rotting carcass.  I know what others may be thinking...why even try food from such a place.  I thought that I would try and follow the old adage and not judge a book by its cover, or in this case an eatery by its smell.  Yet I should have trusted my innate olfactory abilities and avoided consuming anything associated with such a stench.  My Roti was a combination of chicken skin, gristle, ground up chicken bones and what I can only assume were small twigs.  Needless to say I took one bite and proceeded to look for the nearest trash receptacle.  I reserve hope that The Jerk Spot hasn't spoiled the opinion of novice Caribbean foodies whose first encounter may have been less than stellar, for as a seasoned vet, I know that the Jerk Spot is a horrific exception and in no way reflects true Island cooking."}
{"text":"Jerk Spot is pretty much what you'd expect for a hole-in-the-wall jerk/roti place.   Had jerk chicken lunch - spicy.  The spice didn't disappoint.  This is some serious west-indies SPICY.    Wasn't terribly happy with the chicken skin or bones in with the breast, but it wasn't terribly surprising either.    I'd go back for a shot of pepper for sure ;)"}
{"text":"Where do I start with my issues with this place?   1) The food is microwaved. I ordered the roti special for dinner one night and the roti was reheated in the microwave. The end result was a soft, soggy mess that was hot on the edges and bone cold in the center  2) I ran out of rice at home and stopped in to get just a plain serving of white rice. They wanted nearly $7 for a SMALL serving of plain white rice. No condiments, spices, or additions - just WHITE RICE. This is unacceptable due to the fact that rice is cheap and because you can get the jerk chicken combo (WITH RICE) for around the same price (and the same amount of rice!)  3) The service is slow/non-existent. I waited 5 mins to get served (note there isn't a dining room here and there was no line) and then waited another 10-15 for my food. Normally that wait would be acceptable at a takeaway spot but go back to point #1 - the food was already prepared and was simply just microwaved.  If you like Caribbean food, avoid this place at all costs. There are so many better Caribbean/West Indian food options in this area of town."}
{"text":"Recently moved to this area and decided to give it a try. Service 5/5, girls who works there were being friendly. Price is 4/5, reasonable for what you get.   But unfortunately the food is 2.5/5, I am sorry to say that but I've had so much Jerk Chicken from other places that tastes better than the ones from here. The meat didn't marinate enough time so inside it taste quite bland, and it's very dry. The rice was decent with the gravy they put on it. And for the coleslaw, it was way to sweet, almost felt like it's a dessert.   Also one thing maybe they can improve is to have different toppings for combo. The only combo they sell is jerk chicken, rice/peas and coleslaw. I know it's all time classic for jerk chicken but I rather choose to have salad or mashed potatoes instead of rice/peas."}
{"text":"I broadly concur with the reviews below.   My main addendum regards hours: they are closing at 8pm during the week. This is not a good sign as they are missing a lot of the dinner crowd who come by later on their way home from work (e.g. me) and I am not sure what it implies for how business is going.  Pluses: Jerk pork and chicken are good although I am hardly an expert..  Curry goat is very tasty although it can be a little on the salty side on some days.  The very generous daily deals are why I come back when I am around in time. Very friendly staff.  Cons:  None really although I don't find some of the complaints below out of the realm of possibility.  Summary Not the best I have ever had but not the worst; can't be beat on King for the deals when they are open. I hope they stay open. It would be the second Jamaican place to go out of business in that spot in the past two+ years."}
{"text":"Clarifying some points about their specials and hours of operation:  Lunch special: 11am to 2pm, get any small meal (jerk chicken or pork with rice and peas) or roti, for $4.99 with a free pop.  Chef's Special (not sure what it is yet), $6.99  When to eat there:  Sunday to Thursday: 11am to 10pm Friday to Saturday: 11am to 4am"}
{"text":"I love love love rotis!  So I've been wanting to check The Jerk Spot out for  awhile as it's in my 'hood.  I had lunch there today.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the strong smell of bleach.  I ordered a boneless chicken roti made with breast meat rather than from the leg (it costs extra) along with a can of Diet Coke and ate it there.  There were a couple chunks of chicken breast, a couple chunks of potatoes, flakes of nonbreast chicken, lots and lots of sauce (it's quite spicy), chicken skin (maybe from the jerk chicken?) and small bones.  Yes, chicken skin and small bones!!!  Appalling considering I ordered a BONELESS chicken roti.  I've posted pictures.  The quality isn't very good and I couldn't finish it.  I definitely won't be back."}
