{"text":"Found out about this new restaurant. I couldnt be happier. The food is great, the service is excellent!  So far my favorite dish is the Mango salad. Pad Thai is really good too. The texture of the noodles is spot on."}
{"text":"Only a trusted recommendation could get us to deepest Scarborough, (3081) Kingston Rd and McCowan. It was well worth the trip, Thai Indeed will be part of our circuit. 
We had mango salad, lemongrass soup, hot and sour soup, pad thai, penang chicken, cashew nut chicken, marinated grilled beef. A special mention of the hot and sour soup. It is served with a squeeze bottle of soya sauce. My suggestion is to try it without the soya. Every taste comes out, including the bit of char in the onions, and deliciously harmoniously. While I am at it, the spicy indication on the menu is overstated; it certainly doesn't mean that the dish is spicy as I understand heat, and I don't like heat.
All the food, but for one dish, was delicious. The cooking was refined, but because it was Thai it had lots of flavour. It had none of the Thai scourges of too much sugar, too much oil. Indeed, these ingredients were scarcely noticeable. Even the coconut was pleasantly controlled. All the tastes were beautifully balanced.
The only dish that didn't hit the mark- my western mark anyway - was the pad Thai.
The noodles were nicely cooked al dente (believe it or not; first time for me.) and the sauce was tamarind and not the usual ketchup. The first two mouthfuls were delicious. I thought that these people really know how to cook to show this much control. Further into the dish I thought that the dish was too refined and had become boring. I then asked for more peanuts and more lime to squeeze on, another five pieces. After this- I am sure adulteration - I quite liked the dish. An owner saw what I did and asked why I had changed the dish; he must have thought that I had done something weird. I told him. He said that he would consider changing the pad Thai, but not my way.
I wondered what it was that made the cooking so good and asked. The owners are Thai of course. They are from Bangkok, the cooking was Bangkok style. The owners are two engineers and an accountant, upper middle people. It helps.

The room is very nice; the location had been a Japanese restaurant, Prices are reasonable.
The place has been open only a week; notwithstanding, our Friday night was busy."}
{"text":"this place sucks, don't eat here!!!! i got a hair in my food and the portion size/serving for the $10 i spent can feed a small child. they are noodles that cost $3 a bag, don't be cheap and give me some more noodles at least."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty food, we have tried it several times now and never once disappointed. Clean place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Fabulous place. Food is so yummy had the pad Thai and friendly service. I will go back for sure.:)"}
{"text":"We normally satisfy our Thai cravings at Pattya on Queen or Jattujak on Kingston Road but wanted to give Thai Indeed a try since it was closer to home. We ordered take out of the cold salad rolls, the Green curry with Chicken and the red curry with tofu and vegetables.

The bad first because our experience started with a negative

- unlike most Thai places, they could not make my red curry  vegan friendly because the waitress said it had small amounts of fish sauce. Pattya and Jattujak had no problem accommodating my request. I decided to order anyways since I'm plant based for health vs ethics reasons
- the curries were watery in consistency and flavours were quite bland compared to the aforementioned places that were aromatic and deep flavoured
- I ordered no sugar in my curry but it was not expcitly noted in my order. My curry was quite sweet which made me suspicious whether they respected my dietary restriction. I decided not to eat it after a few spoonfuls to be safe. 

The good
- there was no oil in the curries which the waitress mentioned is because they do not stir fry the curry. 

The verdict - for the same price point, Jattujak offers better taste and dietary accommodations. For even better quality, pay a little more for Pattya."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon to try out a few dishes for an early dinner.  We had the following dishes: shrimp chips (very good), beer skewers (nicely done and has a sauce already on it, plus the usual satay dipping sauce), pad thai (while no ketchup seen, it was a bit too sweat), fried rice (beef was too dry, but rice was very flavorful), peanut curry with chicken (curry was good, but chicken was too dry again), and stir fried veggies (veggies too old, bitter).

They didn't have any milkshakes or bubble tea available, to the disappointment of my kids.
Service was slow as they only had 1 waitress working and with 3 tables and 3 takeout orders.

Overall I found their dishes to be authentic and slightly better than Jatujak/Kub Khao, but will have to try more dishes to reach a final verdict."}
{"text":"Bursting with flavour and great service, we are thrilled to have another very fairly priced and authentic restaurant in the neighbourhood. We happened upon it coming home from the cottage and after cooking all weekend we deco used we would \"try\" it. I am happy to say we will be returning...often. We had sweet and sour soup, lemon grass soup, chicken satay for appetizers and each was uniquely flavoured and delicious. Then for the main course we had red curry coconut shrimp and a garlic beef stir fry almond with sweet and sour chicken. Happy to say no leftovers, and not because the portions weren't generous. They were very and we finished it all. Fab and can't wait to return. Too full for desserts."}
{"text":"Nice clean place. The service and food were excellent. I had the coconut soup and the peanut curry. They were both very good."}
{"text":"Came in for a dinner while in the Scarborough area. The food tasted excellent, especially the Cold Chicken rolls. We had a green curry beef and a peanut curry chicken, which were shared between two people. The curry flavours were onpoint, but the meat was not quite tender/juicy enough. Granted this was a Monday evening and the restaurant was not busy, so I didn't know how long that meat had been sitting.

Service was excellent! The water was kept filled, and table was cleared promptly. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really good and authentic Tai food, I know many of us have been going to Spring Rolls downtown or the Famous Tai Restaurant in the beaches. But this one is passing over those levels. Great quality, good quantity and the best price at all. Well and wonderful service, You should try at less once and let people know."}
{"text":"Just had the yellow , daughter had the red curry and her boyfriend had the vegetarian rice dinners. 
Everything was delicious and the spring roll appetizers fantastic with the dipping sauce . My second time there and I will be going back ! Service and price very good !"}
{"text":"Brought the family to check out this restaurant. The location is in a Scarborough strip mall right on Kingston Road, so access is really easy. The restaurant has a clean, modern look, but the dishes are more traditionally Thai.

We started off with some satay chicken, vegetarian cold rolls and crispy wontons for the kids. They gobbled down the wontons - \"really yummy\" and \"I like the filling!\" - were the chorus. The satay disappeared pretty quickly as well - properly cooked chicken with a pungent but not too spicy satay sauce. And the vegetarian cold rolls - their take on salad rolls - were really tasty with great crunch of vegetables and a really nice peanut sauce.
Then we moved on to some pineapple fried rice - an old habit of mine, but I use it to judge them. The rice was perfectly cooked with wonderful flavour, though the pineapple chunks were a bit big. The grilled chicken and beef were also both excellent - nicely flavoured and grilled perfectly so it had crispy bits but wasn't overcooked. The green and red curries were outstanding - wonderfully flavoured, the meat and seafood wasn't overcooked, great balance between sweet and hot, just sooooo yummy! Finally, the pad see ew beef was pretty good, but after the excellent curry a bit of a let down as it was a little too simple.

The food was great, service was on point, and the prices were very reasonable considering the quality of the food. It's great to have a really good Thai restaurant so close to home now! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I definitely would not give this place 4 stars!. My friend and I excited to go for lunch, found this place...but were disappointed to say the least!   Our appetizers came out cold and undercooked and 20 min after our entree. The cold chicken rolls just had chicken and lettuce they deep fried the rice noodle and used it as presentation rather than stuffing it in the rolls. The rolls had been cut up and presented with sauce on top like sushi-wasn't liking that. Calamari was thin, tasteless and cold. We actually asked to have them warmed up- unfortunately still didn't help the cause.The portion sizes are very small for the price and the service was very slow and unfriendly.  My friend ordered a pad Thai and the noodles were soggy and overcooked, spring rolls burnt.  My coconut soup was literally like sweet warm milk ( usually its or orangey and little spicey)- but maybe it can be made differently.   
Ohh boy I feel horrible for giving them such a bad review, but we left hungry, feeling a little sick and disappointed.  I hope this review helps and  others have a better experience, but I think I will pass on trying this place again #disappointed"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are the best value for your money; the lunch portions are almost as big as the regular entrees plus you get 2 egg rolls, and a small bowl of soup or salad.

TRIED:
- Chicken pad Thai lunch - taste much better when you squeeze lime on top, good thing is they DON'T use ketchup in their sauce. Egg rolls that come with it are crispy and tasty. Mango salad is ok. 
- Beef salad - tasty but small, I finished the whole thing and I usually eat only half of a regular sized entree.
- Hot and sour soup was thick and flavorful with good heat.
- Thai iced tea is milky with a weak tea flavor.

Plain decor for a Thai restaurant, comfy tables and booths, attentive and polite service."}
{"text":"Tried this place, its new to the Cliffcrest area. Food was amazing! We ordered takeout. The colours and smells were all great (I wish I took pics - sorry). My husband loves  a good pad thai and was very happy with his order. I had the peanut curry with shrimp (a panang) - it was so flavourful. The kids had the cashew nut stir fry (no spice :)). They were happy. The shrimp chips were of course a big hit with them. The only closest Thai resto to us is Jatujak. I like Jatujak, but after trying Thai Indeed, I will be a frequent orderer from here instead...sorry Jatujak....I find the flavours in this place a bit better for my liking. I took a look in the restaurant too, it was tastefully done, an quite modern looking. They did a great job fixing up the place. What a great addition to the Cliffcrest neighbourhood! We need more restaurants!"}
{"text":"So happy to have another restaurant in the area! I work nearby but there's not a great selection of places to grab lunch when I'm on my break.  I've worked in this neigbhourhood for nearly 5 years, and I don't drive.. I can't even tell you how sick to death I am of eating Tim Hortons for lunch!

I noticed the big orange sign when having a meeting in our office so I took a walk by to check it out. Very nice, contemporary styled dining room. Very large with plenty of seating, so it will be easy to get a table at lunch time or dinner time- unlike the neighbouring Vi Pei which is pretty much always packed. 

Thai Indeed has a great lunch special menu.  Pretty much any thai dish that you're craving is featured at some point during the week on the lunch special menu.  Today I picked up the Green Curry Chicken and Rice.  Lunch specials come with a choice of soup or salad and spring rolls.  Around $10 for the meal. 

The serving is generous, fresh and simply delicious.  I had the hot & and sour soup, and tbh, I only ordered it because I'm feeling under the weather today.  I'm not usually a fan of hot & sour soup.. but this one was so good! I finished the whole tub (and my sore throat is cured! I think I found a better cure to the common cold than chicken soup!)

The green curry is exactly as spicy as I like it.. Very hot, but not enough to burn my face off. Super flavourful-- with that bit of sweetness that soaks into the chicken.  So yummy. 

They packed up my sticky rice in a take out container--the rice was shaped like a star, and topped with a garnish. Super cute. 

The service was fast-- the owners/managers were very friendly and excited to share their new restaurant with their new customers. 

10/10.  I'm so glad this place is open after I'm done work, because I know where I'll be grabbing my take-out dinners from now on!"}
{"text":"This little Thai joint was super close to the Scarborough Bluffs, where we spent the afternoon. We came in just before 8pm on a Thursday night, and there was only one table finishing up. Most customers seemed to be coming in for takeout during our meal.

We ordered lemongrass soup (tom yum) and thai satay for appetizers, which had potent flavours I had never experienced due to my limited exposure to Thai cuisine. Unique and very delicious! We then had stir-fried glass noodles and tilapia with garlic sauce. Quality and service were top notch. This restaurant is quite deep into Scarborough, but it definitely deserves more attention."}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery here a few time and have always enjoyed the food. We have found the beef satay to be a hit or miss. Sometimes its fantastic and other times super chewy or hard to eat. Both the red curry chicken and their cashew chicken are delicious and the curries are of good consistency and spice / flavour. My only issue with this place is with the very very little rice they offer with the curries. Its barely enough to finish half the meal.  Please offer a full / decent portion of rice.."}
{"text":"Lovely meal. Everyone enjoyed their dishes (pineapple fried rice, shrimp Pad Thai, beef peanut curry, appetizers--shrimp spring rolls, chicken satay). Food was flavourful, succulent, nicely presented, very generously portioned. Relaxing ambiance and friendly staff. Exceptionally good service. Our new \"go-to\" spot."}
{"text":"I live nearby and I had waited awhile to try this place. Decided to order takeout (shrimp rolls, mango salad, red curry, peanut curry and coconut soup) and it was delicious. Fast and friendly service as well as good quality food and decent prices. My boyfriend and I eat here way too often now LOL."}
{"text":"I work in the area, and it so nice to have another good food option. My coworkers and I went for the lunch special (which includes salad or soup and spring rolls). I had the cashew chicken with rice, while my coworkers has the green curry and the chicken pad Thai. All of us enjoyed our meals and will definitely be visiting again. I found the food to be fresh and authentic. It is a large and clean restaurant and the service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Open 3 months, and I sure hope it catches on, because they are serving kick-ass Thai food in a beautiful new space with good parking. 

The lunch deals are worth the trip, and rotate according to a published schedule (see their website), but always include 3 types of Pad Thai, and some kind of curry (red, green, or peanut on Wednesday - the date of my visit). 

The sign in front announced the soup of the day, and the salad of the day. Soups are fresh and fantastic as you'd expect from a good Thai restaurant. If the soup of the day was coconut, I'd rush in, but today's lemongrass (Tom Yum) was excellent. 

The entree is served with 2 crispy spring rolls that were perfect. The rice is in a star shape which is a nice touch, and although the bowl of curry looked small, this was a huge meal for $9. High praise indeed for Thai Indeed!"}
{"text":"Given the relatively cheap price point, I was not expecting stellar but my verdict is passable but overly simple and uninspiring. The decor is modern, simple and relatively nice. The Pad Thai was too  sweet and the pasta was overcooked. Chicken and shrimp meant one piece of shrimp. The bean sprouts were sparse and not fresh...."}
{"text":"I often talk about reviewing and never do but I just have to share this experience. We were excited about a somewhat new Thai place opening up nearby as we're huge fans of Thai. Sadly, this excitement faded quickly. 

We ordered online for delivery at around 5:45/6 PM on a Friday night with a good selection of staple dishes that really determine whether a Thai place is up to scratch. They estimated delivery for 6:45. I had to call them at 7:10 PM to ask what's up and she told me the driver left 15 min ago. (I live less than 15 min away). At around 7:45 PM, almost 2 hours later, the driver arrived. He was very nice and apologised multiple times for the wait.

Starving, we eagerly opened the boxes... and tasted them. The beef satays are huge! And pretty tasty (thought very mild) but there's not enough peanut sauce for the whole box. 

The grilled chicken (Kai Yang) was so-so. My girlfriend said that it didn't even taste grilled anymore after sitting in tinfoil for so long. It certainly didn't look grilled as it limply came out of the foil. She also ordered the Yum Woon Sen and it had no minced chicken at all even thought it says that on the menu! Lots of shrimp though. Fish cakes (Tod Mun Pla) were all right but it's really difficult to make a terrible fish cake. 

I ordered the Pla Rad Prik (sweet chilli fish) and was shocked at how small the piece of fish was considering it was the most expensive thing we ordered. It was over-fried and the sauce was too mild (watered down it seemed) and full of useless vegetables to bulk it up. Unlike other places I've had this dish, I'd rather eat the fish without the sauce! 

Next was the green curry -- which is my favourite thing at most Thai places. This had the perfect heat to it, and none of that cloying sweetness some places have ....but it was far more like broth consistency than curry, and not a thick hearty soup either. I couldn't believe how INCREDIBLY thin and watery it was! Furthermore, I asked for chicken and they gave me the not-as-expensive tofu instead but charged for the chicken -- with the typical weird Canadian additions of carrots, broccoli, snow peas (Why?!). Granted, I'm mildly allergic to all eggplants (which I told them) but I doubt they would have had Thai/pea eggplants anyway. Possibly one of the worst green curries I've had in Toronto, and there are quite a few bad green curries in this city. Very disappointing. 

For some odd reason every Thai restaurant here insists on putting sweet peppers, broccoli and carrots in everything! We specifically asked for no sweet peppers knowing this. I can't really fault this place for doing that as well cos that's what all the (Western) people want but this place is NOT authentic Thai by any stretch of the imagination.

Finally, I had the Indeed Pad Thai just because it's an easy way to fill my belly and judge a place. It was awful. A lot of Canadian-ized pad thai is just as awful but at most have flavour? This was just noodles, filler veg, and NO flavour, other than something too sweet. NO taste of lime, shallots, tamarind, fish sauce, garlic chives, etc. Nothing. No egg. And they *really* scrimped on the crushed peanuts. Not nearly enough. And served with a slice of orange, not lime? So confusing. Really need side lime. At least they don't use ketchup however. This one I actually ordered tofu so of course, it comes with broccoli and carrots... To top it off, this had clearly been sitting in the plastic for a long time as all the noodles condensed and formed a big lukewarm lump that was very hard to tease apart.

Every dish was garnished with parsley for some reason, and oranges.

PRO: Nice big helpings of side rice.

I'm sure the people are very nice and they listened to all of the special notes we included but the food wasn't good, especially for the price. Prices are good, not exorbitant but for the quality and quantity you actually get, it's not worth it. Especially the pla rad prik and pad thai (you get a lot of noodles but they have no flavour other than sweet). Best deal was the satays both for the size of them and how many you get.

Considering the 2-hour wait, messed up orders, missing chicken, congealed noodles, watery curry, small dry fish, and flavourless chilli sauce and pad thai, I don't expect to every try it again. One thing wrong, I can handle--and maybe they were having an off-day--but so many things weren't good at all. I really, really wanted to like it and have another Thai place near home to give my business but sadly this won't be it. Let's hope they were just having a bad day and other times are better for other people. I thought about calling and complaining but I didn't see much point. There's nothing they could have done after the fact although I'm sure they would have been nice."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! I ordered delivery from here to work one night not expecting too much since I ordered because it is local. It is some of the best Thai food I have had in years. Complex flavours true to Thai cuisine. Not too greasy. Had Thai green curry and the spicy noodles. Will definitely be going here again."}
{"text":"TL;DR
It's a good spot to hit up when you're craving Thai food, not somewhere I'd intentionally travel out of the way to but definitely worth it if you're near the bluffs.

----------------

First off. This is a dope lil' Thai spot near the Scarborough Bluffs!

The food is delicious, the staff is nice and the place is clean. There's not much more that you can ask for from a restaurant and Thai Indeed surely delivers. I believe they said they just opened up last year.

When we walked in it was a nice quiet spot, a few other couples and seemed like a lot of take-out/delivery happening. Nice chill spot and well lit. 

We ordered 2 beers (Singha), Shrimp Pad Thai, and Veggie Green Curry and I think it came up to around 45 before tip? Nonetheless, it's the average restaurant prices for good food! We had more curry than rice but that's typical, didn't have a great appetite that day but they were insistent that if we needed rice they'd bless us with some. (IMO that's key cause, not enough restaurants do that). But nonetheless we had a great experience and if we're in that neck of the city we'd def go again."}
