{"text":"Our family goes to Red Bee a lot. The burgers are TO DIE FOR: flavourful, spiced so nicely and cooked to perfection. Best burgers in Whitby by far. Since the renovations the place looks great too!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times with my family. Great breakfast and lunch place. Very-very-very inexpensive. All local business owners go there for lunch.  Owner is super friendly.  I support local businesses."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but the food is good. Nice clean diner-style restaurant.   Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"We went to this place because we saw great reviews for it but were disappointed with our meal.   The place itself is run down. There are broken booths and seats, not to mention dirty walls and kitchen. The service is very slow and you can't pay with credit. It was like being trapped in time!  The food lacks flavour and portions are pretty small. We ordered the Benedict and 'the big breakfast'. We asked for extra crispy bacon and got soggy instead. We had to send the pancakes back because they were undercooked and the replacements were tough lol! It was a horrible experience and we will not back. Why doesn't Durham have any good breakfast joints??"}
{"text":"First off, prices are fantastic. Secondly,  very clean. Thirdly, friendly service. Food was great, also. I tasted my husband's pancakes and they were the best I've ever tasted! Yum! Decor could use a little help, but that's no reason not to give it 5 stars, in my opinion. Local artwork on the walls, which is also cool. Will be back soon!!!"}
