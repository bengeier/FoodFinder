{"text":"Munch is a hidden gem. Inside the Case Western Law school, this unique sandwich / soup restaurant has many yummy delights. Starting with the soups .  The corn chowder is outstanding. I have had the mushroom, onion and gazpacho and all were first rate. Fresh vegetables, wonderful seasoning make for a hardy meal. The sandwiches are unique and superb . The club is one of my favorites. it consists of turkey off the bone with bacon, tomato, lettuce and herbed mayo. If you like Mediterranean sandwiches such as falafel, hummus, baba, tabbouleh you must try these. The melts and wraps are unusual and delicious. A Peanut butter, banana and grape wrap ... Wow!! What a wrap.  Breakfast is also a complete menu. Bagel sandwiches, breakfast burrito, incredible muffins, smoothies and Seattle's  best coffee all help start my day. The one thing I really like about this restaurant is that they dare to try new and interesting concepts....and it works!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it three stars on its own, but considering its location and surroundings it's a four.    My friend is a CIA student.  I said I would meet her for lunch between classes.  She suggested maybe just ice cream or yogurt because where on earth do you get decent lunch around here on a college student budget?  The answer was right next door to her studio building in the Case Law building.    Service was very friendly. We came around two and everything was silent--so nice.  I'm sure that around actual lunch time it is not like this.  I ordered the Big A Falafal wrap.  It was falafal, tomato, bell pepper, sprouts, hummus, mushrooms all rolled up in a toasty pita and served with a pickle.  The pickle was really crunchy and the sandwich was pretty good.  Not the greatest falafal I've ever had--it was a little dry, but the veggies were fresh, the hummus was yum, the flavors blended well, and it was enough food for two lunches.  So good.  I loved the additions of the sprouts and bell pepper.  Those are things that you don't usually find on falafal wraps and they were really good.   My friend and I enjoyed a delicious, enormous lunch with a beautiful view for less than six dollars each."}

{"text":"Located inside the Law School at Case Western Reserve University, Schticks is a difficult place to review.  First, you have to deal with the surly owner-manager.  Certainly not the most friendly person I have ever met, but I am not sure I can completely blame him.  He gets up at like 3am or something, (which  would certainly put me in a bad mood) each morning to come to the law school (another reason) to serve coffee, muffins, and wraps to bratty law students (yet another reason).  The muffins rock, the coffee is Seattle's Best, which is fine by me, although many people complain about this point (see bratty law students comment above).  The problem is when you get to the food.  The space is small and apparently the owner cannot have a grill or similar in this space due to fire codes.  This means that you are mostly left with PB&J or turkey and alfalfa sprout wraps.  The really sad thing is that there is hardly any other decent options in this area, so this place is about as good an option as any.  Blackacre (the name of the lounge area with tables to eat the food, haha) is really crowded come lunch time with aforementioned students.  Best to grab and go at that hour, if you can."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, and friendly service. I can't believe I've been in University Circle for so long and never knew about this place.  I got the Julie's Tabouli falafel wrap. I love that they use sprouts! And the kosher pickle was the perfect side. There was definitely enough that I could take home half my sandwich, too. Although, if I would have eaten the whole thing I wouldn't have felt sick. Perfect portioning.  I'm really excited to go back and try some of the melts and a smoothie. In fact, the entire menu looks great!"}
{"text":"A quaint well hidden spot hidden inside the case law building. Upon entering this location you are immediately greeted by a kind and knowledge team member always happy to help. There is a vast array of different items on the menu. Something for everyone. Melts, Wraps, Pita sandwiches, hot or cold. And the food is delicious. Light, heartwarming, simple, and inexpensive are the words that come to mind when describing the food at munch. I ordered the tuna with peppers, white cap mushrooms, and herbed mayonnaise. AMAZING! A must stop when visiting University circle"}
{"text":"The reviews here are a bit dated, and since I'm a regular at Munch (formerly known as Schticks) and a happy new Yelper, I thought I would add my fresh take on the hole in the wall place.  I wasn't kidding when I said hole in the wall. It's basically a lunch counter on the second floor of the Law School building at Case Western Reserve University. It's hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for. Many people go through school at Case and the nearby Cleveland Institute of Music and don't even know Munch is there. It's pretty poorly marketed in that regard...all the have is a sign on the lawn out front and word of mouth that it's a decent lunch place.   With Sergio's gone, it's definitely the best lunch to be found on Case campus. The Coffee House is horrendous and Denny's is even worse. You really can't go wrong if you want a grab-and-go style lunch or a wrap that will fill you up.  For $6 you can get a melt that will do just that. They have plenty of vegetarian offerings and their falafel is quite good. If I'm in that mood, I'll usually go with \"The Hobb\" and tell him to add hummus to it. The Max is also good. You can get either a wrap or a melt that's hot with cheese. I go that route most of the time just because it's more food and I prefer them hot.  If you want to get a little meat on your bones, there's options for the carnivore in you too! The Turkey Pastrami, Turkey and especially the Chicken Salad are my faves here. The Chicken Salad is especially meaty. I slather it up with Sriracha and Chili Flakes (found on-site!) and I'm good to go.  I've had friends try the Mazo Ball soup or the Chili and they have said they enjoy it. It comes with a huge stack of pita chips on the side and is a pretty good deal. I've had the parfait and while a bit overpriced it was definitely handmade and fresh. My friend Jeff had the pizza once and he seemed to be enjoying it. I've honestly never heard anyone complain about the food the dozens of times that I've been there.  The coffee is good too. Better than anything else I've had in the area and I'm pretty discerning. I'd rather have Phoenix, but this is three tiers up from Coffee House down the street which is the worst stuff on the planet and it's a tier up from Starbucks and Panera. It used to be Seattle's Best but it Carabou Coffee now. 2.25 for 24oz at the time of this review. The owner also offers a Peanut Butter and Banana smoothie that's actually quite filling if that's what you're looking for. I've tried polishing down one of those with my Chicken Salad and I couldn't do it. Not back for under $10 in University Circle.  The only reason I don't give it a four stars is because the wait time can get a little bit long and the atmosphere is that of a cafeteria. There's a definite rush period in between law classes, and the lack of seating can be a problem, especially in the winter when there's no where to go. A law student will take up huge tables to himself and your group will have no where to eat.. The decor is spartan and the vibe is actually a bit stressful with the law students around. This really isn't the owner's fault, but the orders do take quite a long time at this 12-1pm rush hour and it does negatively effect the experience.   If i'm in the area and know I'll be going there, I'll call ahead of time and give my order,. It's always ready when I arrive, and they keep it hot for me, too.   For what it is, and for getting value on your hard earned cash, you really can't do better than Munch. That's why I keep going back."}
{"text":"My go to place in University Circle. Located in the Law School, this place is the only deli in the neighborhood. Great sandwiches, freshly baked cookies and brownies, and plenty of veggie options. Homemade soups are amazing, too! We're hooked!"}
{"text":"One thought: Shticks = sprouts.   The wraps are less than impressive. Mainly sprouts, Scott (owner) must buy them in bulk. However the rotating soups are good and the matzo ball soup has a good taste. The muffins in the morning are also to die for.  The one wrap I could recommend is the PBB&J (peanut butter, grapes in a wrap). A excellent combo.  The seattles best coffee isnt bad, but your better bet for coffee would be walking to the Arabica one block East, or Puera Vita coffee in Thwing.  Seating from 12-1 is near impossible with the students at the school all getting lunch at the same time, but other than that Blackacre is empty.  And as for us bratty law students, we arent all bad."}
