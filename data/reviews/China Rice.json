{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The best!!! The food is amazing... We just ordered... Excited lol"}
{"text":"Craving Chinese decided to try China Rice .. Delish!! Fresh, friendly and fast delivery will be going back for more..  Loving the price !!!"}
{"text":"My exported r was great. Very friendly family. Good was fresh and delicious. I requested something that was not on the menu and they were still Able to accommodate what I needed. Prices are very good and I'm very happy I tried this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I googled good chinese restaurants in mesa looking for one that had combo plates and came across the reviews on this one so I thought what the heck....Place was a little hole in the wall..but the service was great.....food was delicious and cooked fresh right in front of you....my mom loved the egg rolls and my dad was pleased with the mongolian beef....we have enough food left for the next 3 days!!!...So worth it"}
{"text":"Terrible. Customer service is terrible, I was rushed through an order and they made me feel like my business was unwanted. If they don't want it, I'll take it to Panda Express down the street. Maybe I'll get better service and better food there."}
{"text":"Good prices, huge portions, and great tasting. With fast delivery. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Omg I love me some china rice!!!! This place has the best china food ever. The restaurant is scary looking, and I guess the family owns and runs it because the mom answers the phone, the father cooks and the son delivers. The food is absolutely delicious, the service is great delivery is fast and the price is unbelievable. I love the free crab puff coupon on the back of the menu. This is my favorite restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but you never know when they'll be open. Many times we've gone there during business hours and they'll be closed. It's a hit and miss as to when they'll be open. A little frustrating."}
{"text":"I have order from here multiple times and the food is good. But not very happy. I ordered my food at 11 o'clock when they open for delivery.  Call at 11:45pm to ask the status of my food. Guy on the phone said 25 more mins. Call again at 12:10. No one answered the phone call again at 12:20 no one answered the phone again. So I thought they were not coming so I made myself lunch. The guy showed up at 12:35. I told him it's been over an hour and 30 minutes since I have called and I thought no one was coming. But I told him I would pay half price for my food. And he said no he was super rude and not understanding. Not happy!"}
{"text":"Date of incident was in January.    Food was OK.  Took 55 min. for fried rice and sweet and sour pork. Didn't bother to put any sort of utensils in the bag either so had it not been for a Good Samaritan, we would have been eating with our fingers. This is clearly unacceptable. I will go elsewhere in the future"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food places ever! Their Sesame Beef is delish! I ordered it Friday, and couldn't stop thinking about it all weekend and will be ordering it again today! Do not let the little hole in the wall steer you away from this place. Delivered to our office hot and fresh! I can't say enough good things about this place. We have ordered the General Tso, Almond chicken, sweet and sour and each dish was good."}
{"text":"Food was fairly flavorless, but my main complaint was seeing the giant roach crawl up the wall and into the kitchen. Grossssss."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Super cheap and solid food. You get much more than you pay for. The highlights for me are the sesame chicken which is always perfectly cooked crispy sweet. The pot stickers are other worldly. I have a dumpling addiction and this place fillls the need. They have a great texture and the meat is perfectly seasoned. The pot sticker sauce is right on and makes everything better. If you want cheap delicious Chinese American  food this is the place in mesa. Be warned that the restaurant is a whole in the wall but they deliver in a pretty wide radius."}
{"text":"We have them deliver us lunch at my shop a couple times a month, the food is always very good and portions are huge."}
{"text":"Food was ok... not the best Chinese fast food but I guess you get what you pay for. Happened to be in the area but will definitely not be going out of my way to order from here again."}
{"text":"Really awesome portions and delivery service and for what it's worth the food is pretty scrumdiddly."}
{"text":"As others have pointed out, it isn't much to look at but don't judge this book by its cover.  Basically take out only despite having tables inside.  We've had take-out orders there 4 or 5 times now and never been disappointed with a single dish.  Super fresh (everything made to order) and piping hot (even after driving 20+ minutes to get it home)!  Best Chinese I've had in a long time.  I'll definitely go back again and recommend it without reservation.  Skip the sameness of all the Chinese buffets and head over to China Rice for some take-out.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"So...we have been in the area about 18 months; still looking for a good place for Chinese since we left our military environs in CA replete with multiple options. We have found it! China Rice is on speed dial.  The food is good, and \"generous\" is an understatement when it comes to portions and value.  The crab puffs are a good starter...very tasty. We got sweet and sour chicken and shrimp fried rice. The rice was not gooey, but not dry either - \"just right\" and flavorful, the shrimp perfectly cooked, the chicken tender, and the sauce really nice: truly sweet and sour.  Probably the only wish would be for less chunky veggies in the sweet and sour (there was so much chicken it didn't really matter to my husband), and for there to be veggies in the fried rice (I will just order differently next time.).  As for comments re: the premises...true, it is not a new or modern building, but it was not dirty, nor did it smell greasy or nasty (and I'm a big one on \"smells\"...left two other places because of the smell alone.) The folks were friendly and ready exactly when they said it would be.  We definitely will return to China Rice!"}
{"text":"I've actually been to this hole in the wall a few times and each time the impress me in their quick and friendly service and delicious food. The portions are huge and the flavor of each dish were amazing. I highly suggest and would definitely recommend paying them a visit. I've experienced both picking up my order an delivery service. Generally speaking the delivery service takes 30-45 minutes but on their busier days I've experienced an hour or so. In my opinion still very acceptable and worth the wait for the food. I highly suggest the fried rices and chow meins. The egg roll and crab puffs are also delicious for starters .. Their teriyaki chicken general Tao chicken Kung pao dishes and pepper beef are amazing and a personal favorite! Hope this helps:)"}
{"text":"If you want large portions with amazing flavors, this is the place to come.  First, there is only one gentleman working behind counter.  It is family owned and he cooks your food to order.  He admitted to us that his customer service skills aren't the best and the reason why is because he chops all his vegetables as you order and cooks everything fresh:  AND IT TASTES LIKE IT! I ordered spicy vegetables and bbq pork; and my friend ordered Mongolian Beef with egg rolls.  It was piping hot and the vegetables were spot on crisp and delicious and NOT soggy.  The owner came out and sat down with us and talked with us about his family and he was very, very personable.  I will be back because the portions are huge, the prices are right and the food is flavorful and fresh.  Don't let the outside of the building deter you from going there.  Inside is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Facility is dingy but the food and service is great. I had the Vegetable Chow Mien and Vegetable MooSho."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town. A true hidden gem. I have been here twice in the past week. Everything is fresh and they give very generous portions at an affordable price. So far i have had the orange chicken and Mongolian beef. Love how crispy the orange chicken is. And the Mongolian beef is rich in flavor. The pork fried rice is perfect. Love love love this place. DO NOT let the outside area keep you from going inside. I made that mistake for the past year!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price, used to go here all the time, but I will no longer go after finding out Iv been buying more food to get the free crab puffs only to see they have been charging me full price for them all the time, don't offer something free then charge for it and give a shady receipt that doesn't show what I paid for. Great food not a good way to conduct your business. I will not be coming back... Be sure to watch them fill out the receipt they fill out..."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, plentiful and cheap. We love the orange chickin, fried rice, and egg drop soup. The family that owns and runs is super sweet.   The only downside is that they are extremely unreliable when it comes to pickup time. I always add an extra 10-15 minutes to the time given and often end up waiting 10 minutes past that.  Today I placed my order at 5:45 arrived at the shop at 610, and did not get my order until 6:25 to 6:30 after being told order would be ready in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Not terrible, just not good.  Rather bland.  We have tried them twice, and on each occasion it was bland. Good presentation on the delivery, just bland.  I usually go for a big Punch of flavor, but I cannot find it at this place.   Best thing was the Lomein and Kung Pao beef"}
{"text":"Aside from being a tiny little hole in the wall that you have to search hard to find in the neighborhood...the place can be called your little diamond in the rough. Its looks are definitely deceiving.   I arrived and the man at the counter immediately came to ask us what we wanted. We ordered Szechwan Chicken, Orange Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken and finally Pork Fried Rice.   Driving home the aroma of the food was just killing me I was so ready to pull over and try everything...but I knew my family would kill me. Finally got home and we were able to break into the food! All I can say was that it was AH...MAZING! best PFR I've tasted in a really long time, the sweet and sour chicken just sang in my mouth the sauces for the S&SC were wonderful the red sauce was good but the honey dip was just wonderful.  So would I give my recommendations on this place the answer would be a resounding YES!"}
{"text":"The best price without sacrificing quality! Will definitely order takeout again from here. It was very quick and staff was very polite."}
{"text":"Do not judge a book by its cover or we would have never walked in. For sure this hole in the wall is a diamond in the rough. Love this place! We eat here weekly! The sesame beef could feed 2 or more. All the portions are great. The cook/owner/delivery man is such a hard worker!  General Taos chicken is good, haven't had anything that wasn't delish."}
{"text":"Delicious food and large portions; we regularly get the Chicken Curry and the Orange Chicken/Pork. Enough food for more than 1 meal. Love that they deliver too."}
{"text":"Got the dinner for two which came with orange chicken, egg flour soup, pork fried rice, and broccoli beef. The orange chicken was tasty but, the egg flour soup tasted like pepper and the beef had the flavor of fish. Although the broccoli and the sauce was pretty good. The pork fried rice was good. I also got an order of crab puffs and was disappointed because there wasn't a bit of crab in it... at least the cook gave them to me free.  The cook was very nice!"}
{"text":"Huge portions for an awesome price! White rice is very good especially with the Orange chicken! Great delivery service as well!"}
{"text":"A great Chinese restaurant. From the outside you'd never expect it to be good. They left flyers on my door so I took a chance and ordered take out. We got fried wontons, beef fried rice, sautéed spicy pork, and Szechuan beef both dinner plates also came with white rice for about $25. The food was delicious and we got a lot for the price. I'll definitely be going back! I'd recommend it"}
{"text":"This review isn't about the food but it is about the service. I tried to call in an order at around 1pm on a Sunday. The person speaking was not fluent in English. No problem, I am half Asian, it's not a big deal. But I tried to explain that we were only like 3.5 miles away from their store and that they have delivered here before. Maybe they don't usually take orders more than 3 miles out but we had at least a $30.00 order. I would think an 8-10 minute drive would be worth it. The last time they did deliver to us, the food was great. Hence the reason we called back. I guess if we want food here we will have to pick it up. Maybe the gentleman didn't know where I was talking about. But google maps is a beautiful thing."}
{"text":"They deliver! I haven't officially dined in so I cannot say much about the place, but the food is good, you get a lot for your money.  We have tried several of the combo meals and all have been great so far.  The sauces are nice and thick and not super runny like a lot of places.  Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is fabulous, my only problem is how dirty the place is. The door knob, the tables, the counter. They don't clean anything. I overlook that though and keep going back because the food is so good. I usually just get it to go. Great portions, they prepare it fast. The Sesame Beef is perhaps my fav food in the world! If they'd get out the Lysol and wipe things down I'd give them five stars"}
{"text":"Great food. Lovely price, and most authentic Chinese food in the valley! Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We ordered orange chicken,  Mongolian beef, potstickers and crab puffs. Every single item was delicious. I usually never like Chinese takeout. Ever. But our delivered food far exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Horrible location. I opted for delivery and it came fast.   For right bucks it was huge on portions. One person can't finish one combo. The orange chicken was on par with what you'd expect. The rice and noodles were way good.   Definitely good for delivery Chinese food."}
{"text":"The lunch special is a phenomenal deal. I got a hefty portion of delicious, crispy sesame chicken with fried rice for just a little over $4 with tax (egg rolls can be added for an extra dollar). It's true the interior isn't the best but you can always take out your food if you prefer not to eat inside."}
{"text":"We tried China Rice for the first time tonight and really liked it. For two people we ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, Schezuan Pork, 2 egg rolls and the 10 free crab puffs and have plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day. All of the food was great with a lot of fresh vegetables and good meat. We are located just north of the delivery area which is a bummer so we went and picked ours up. It seems to be a family owned restaurant and they were very nice. Great to support such a small place and we will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"With only three reviews so far, I didn't set my expectations high, which was a good thing.   First, I wish I would've done delivery. Not the best place to be after dark, and you DO NOT want to \"dine in\", unless you feel the need to watch the 27\" rabbit-eared TV and sit next to the serving pan on the next table.  Guy was really friendly (yelled \"MICHAEL!\" when I walked in. I must've been the only order?). He quickly put down his cigarette and finished my order nicotine free.   The portions are huge. I got two dinner specials (comes with fried rice, lo mien, egg roll, and cream cheese won ton for $8) and my wife and I would not have even finished one of them.  But how did it taste? My orange chicken and beef & broccoli tasted just like every other average chinese food.  The cream cheese won tons were the stars."}
{"text":"Amazing for take out/delivery!  HUGE portions, super low prices, great specials, and so far everything I've ordered has been very good!  I love this place......only reason it's not 5 stars is the appearance.  It definitely not a place you take a date to to impress.   Small, ugly and in the ghetto......to he honest, the first time I pulled up to pick up my food I was scared.  It reminds me of a small N.Y. hole in the wall. But if you just want a lot of really good Chinese food for super cheap.......it's your place!"}
{"text":"Called the store some ass hole answered and said fuck you and hind up. Very rude I wouldn't  recommend them to anyone"}
{"text":"My family loves this place!!! We have tried and tried to find a good delivery place here for two years and I never tried this one based on appearance. Well you truly cannot judge a book by its cover!!! I ordered cashew chicken and it was amazing and soooooo much food. My kids sweet and sour chicken was great and so was the seseame chicken. It was quick to get here and so hot! This is our new place for sure!!"}
{"text":"I don't know about the food yet, but it is really ghetto as far as interior and exterior go. Definitely in a questionable part of town. Hope the food's good. All I want to do is leave! It's that bad in here. Ok, the food, \"sigh\", not so good, edible, but is that all I want from my food? The answer is no, I'm afraid. When I got it home, the sauce had leaked all over the bag, so much so that I didn't see the egg roll I had ordered and by the time I realized it was missing it had been soaking at the bottom of my \"pool\" of sauce that I just decided to forget about eating that egg roll. I ordered Kung pow chicken. It was mostly bell pepper and onion, some chicken and maybe two peanuts? Very disappointing. For now, Grace Garden is still my go too place for good Chinese food, go there!"}
{"text":"I would have liked to have given this restaurant a higher score. I called for delivery to Mesa Spirit RV park which I thought they would know about because it's just down the street. There are 2000 people in this subdivision type RV park so I have to believe they have delivered here. The man who answered the phone spoke broken English. Ask my husband if he could pick it up. Don't offer delivery if you don't know your deliver areas. Other people have said don't let the look of the place keep you away. My husband almost did not go in but he knows Yelp users have so far never let us wrong. He said if I had been with him I would not have gone in. But he did go in and picked up our food. I had the orange chicken dinner. It was ok but the fried food had the taste of being cooked in old oil. My husband had the shrimp in lobster sauce and said it was good. Over all just your average Chinese food. Noting spectacular but other than needing to change the oil the food was fresh. Try it they may have just had an off day."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food.  Don't let the outside our inside fool you,  get trading HUGE portions.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had a favorite little Chinese food that I went to for years, the mom and dad sold the place and I never went there again.  I tried many places and did not like them, stumbled across China Rice and I LOVE IT.  They are friendly, excellent prices, you get a ton of food.  I love the Sesame Chicken.  The delivery guy is awesome, friendly, prompt.  If your wanting great Chinese delivery, try China Rice, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Looks are deceiving. Don't let this place fool you. It look like a whole in the wall, but their food is some of the best there is. The House (chicken, pork, and shrimp) Fried Rice is off the chain. The portions are hugely ginormous. You will have enough for dinner plus leftovers to take for lunch at work if need be. It's a small family owned authentic Chinese establishment. We eat there quite often. I highly recommend China Rice to anyone in Mesa wanting good affordable Chinese food."}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times now and I will be a regular forever. It is a hole in the wall if there ever was one but the food is so good, plentiful and most importantly cheap! The guy who runs it is super nice! Worth a try!"}
{"text":"After a break from ordering for almost a year we tried them again. I was pleasantly  surprised and glad I decided to try them again. Food was fresh and very good. I hope this continues!"}
{"text":"My dad introduced me to this place about a year ago. Their food is amazing! Always super friendly service and HUGE portions. I order for 3 people and it's enough to have leftovers for the next 3 days - all for less than $20.   It's always fresh, hot, and the flavor is spectacular."}
{"text":"Tried to view their menu online to get a better idea of what they had to offer.  Kept going to a site for online food orders that had nothing to do with China Rice.  So when my wife got off of work I had her swing by the restaurant to check out the menu and let me know what they had.  I asked her to get the Sweet and Sour chicken and Fried rice, figuring that would be a safe bet.  Now in the past a restaurant that would serve orders to go would put the Sauce on the side, to keep the deep fried chicken from getting soggy.  Well, not China Rice, not only was the container dripping with water the container had enough sauce in it to overflow into the bag.  Needless to say the chicken was so soggy that I just threw it in the trash!  When a business doesn't understand what happens to their food when they package it to go, then why are they even bothering?  I read the reviews about their not really being an option to eat in before I sent my wife to get it to go, that is why I did not go for a sitdown meal.  I guess I have to ask every question imaginable to make sure we are on the same page before I order.  Fact is, most restaurants don't care about their food once they take your money and put the food in a container, because they don't care whether you come back or not."}
{"text":"HUGE portions. I could not finish my meal. At $8 one combo meal can feed a small army.   I ordered the general tso's chicken combo(every combo includes fried rice, chicken lo mein, an egg roll and cream crab puffs), but since I ordered delivery I needed to order $12 worth of food. I added pepper steak with onions to reach a total of $18 after delivery.   The food was piping hot when I got it, however it was just okay. The general tso's chicken was average, the fried rice was lacking in eggs or any other stir fry veggies, but the lo mein was excellent as well as the egg rolls and cream crab puffs. The best dish was easily the pepper steak - excellent flavor, fresh peppers and onions, and tender steak- it was great. I'll definitely eat here again, but for now I need to overcome this food induced coma."}
{"text":"Just called and asked the ETA for my simple delivery after waiting much longer than expected and was starting to wonder if they had forgotten about it. Man on the phone was incredibly rude. Yelled at me to \"Stop talking! When you talk I can't cook! I'm busy! Stop asking  questions! I'm busy! I'm busy!\" Then HUNG UP on me. My question was a simple \"Do you have an idea on when it will arrive?\" I've never been spoken to so rudely before by someone who I thought wanted my business. What a joke. Never again."}
{"text":"After moving out of the delivery zone for my favorite Chinese food restaurant (Pong Pong), I needed to find a new place. Although the place looks rather worn from the outside, I decided to give it a try after reading the other Yelp reviews. I'm glad I did!  What seemed to be the owner took my order and then cooked my food himself. I was there in the early afternoon, so the place wasn't busy although he did get a couple of delivery calls while I was there. It took approximately 15 minutes for my food to be cooked and packaged. Not much longer than a burger joint!  Having been used to Pong Pong of Tempe, I was amazed when I picked up my takeout order. It was heavy enough to be at least 3 Pong Pong meals for each 1 China Rice meal.   When I got it home and unpacked my food, the chow mein with my dinner combo turned out to be enough for a meal unto itself. There was also a lot of rice. But there was also a great deal of each entree, so they don't give you a massive amount of chow mein just so they can skimp on the main course.   Unlike some Chinese food places, the vegetables are cooked almost completely without being soggy. Even Pong Pong will often give you half-raw veggies and these were not raw, nor were they overcooked. And the flavor was very good - the spicy dishes were flavorful without being overpoweringly spicy. The beef was soft and tender. The pork was also nicely cooked. Not a lot of sauce, but that's the way I like it. I'd rather pay for more food than sauce.  The eggrolls are pretty good but if there is meat in them, I couldn't taste it. They are, however, well cooked and crisp without being soggy or drippy with oil.   The \"crab puffs\" (honestly, does anyone actually put crab in these things any more?) are the best I've ever had. Instead of a tiny dollop of cream cheese, there's a VERY generous spoonful inside each wonton. With Pong Pong, I would eat the crispy edges and save the tiny bit of cream cheese for last. Not so with these. I can eat these from end to end.  Each meal is definitely enough for two people, possibly three. After eating what I could, I have at least enough left for lunch tomorrow if not a bit more for an afternoon snack besides.   This is a great place for hungry teenagers with bottomless stomachs, due to the enormous amount of food you get for a relatively low price. Cheaper than a pizza and much more filling."}
{"text":"Amazing, local, fresh Chinese food with large enough portions to feed 2-3 people per dish. This place looks like a dive, but do not be fooled by outward appearances. They are always busy, because they are good! And Chinese food delivered, in Mesa, AZ? Awesome! We are new, happy customers for life."}
{"text":"Good portions,quick-ish.  its like a step up from panda express."}
{"text":"Oh my, my, my. I tried. It was a failure. I was already scared walking in due to wretched business front, prior to that parking my car there. HOOD son. HOOD. As I walked in I was the only would have been customer and there was a gentleman mopping the floors (he was very nice) and a guy behind the staple Chinese food life of a green counter behind it. He asked me to wait a moment as he was preparing flied lice. As I stood and watched him, two, not one, but two roaches climbed on his shoe...seriously. I am sure there could be kind words but my words are not. If I had a donkey, seven ping pong balls and a hooker I promise you you this place would have business. Otherwise, this place lacks in everything and should be condemned."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of those places that you find and you want to keep coming back to.  One because their prices are great and two because their food is excellent and three because you just get a whole bunch of food for what you pay for, and if those three things don't add up for you maybe you oughta try someplace else to eat.  There's nothing fancy about this place because what you get is really good food, that's what you get here, you don't get fancy service or over the top dining facility it's none of that; what you get is straight up good food.  If you've got time on your hands and want good Chinese food and you've got time to sit and enjoy a meal that doesn't have to be fancy dining and all the froufrou that goes with expensive cuisine, then just stop in and enjoy, you won't be disappointed.  Just remember that when you keep expectations in check excellence is delivered!"}
{"text":"Huge portions and authentic food!    The place looks a little sketchy on the outside (that's not an understatement), but the food was surprisingly good.  I ordered the sesame chicken combo, which came with egg rolls and fried rice, totaling about $9 after drink and tax.  Everything was made fresh to order, right in front of me.  The heaping portions barely fit in the box, and were probably 2-3 times the serving you'd get at Panda.  The chicken was hot, crispy, and delicious (a little light on the sauce for my taste, but still great).  The egg rolls were steaming hot.  And the fried rice was full of egg and fresh cut veggies.    They're open until 930, even on Sunday, which was a huge plus for me.  The owner seems to be the only staff there, and he was very polite and appreciative of my business.  I'd definitely go back.  Don't judge this place by its cover.  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Good food, but dining in isn't recommended! I'll stick to delivery next time! Parents were craving Chinese and from our experience from delivery the food was good but didn't think dining in would be that bad! .... They should just be a delivery resto, no dining in."}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE!  We always order from here up until My brother in law ordered his usual and had a big cockroach smashed into his food. Watch out."}
{"text":"Confused?????????????.Just drove here for lunch and it's CLOSED.... not certain if that means permanently or just on Sunday.... Everything listed says 11a-9p are their hours so I don't know what's up."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese place! Been going for years. It's family owned and operated. The parents cook and the children work the counter and deliveries. Very consistent. I recommend the sesame (really honey) chicken. General TSOs chicken, Mongolian beef, and chicken low mien. Large quantities. Not a place to dine out. It's a pick up or deliver spot."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices. We got two dinner combos and had a lot leftover. Sesame chicken was good but the general tso's was dry with all of the sauce at the bottom of the dish. Still it was a good overall meal that I would get again maybe with only one dinner combo which will save us a lot of money. Am thinking the general tso issue was just an honest mistake. Service was great. Very friendly and helpful. Loses a star for cleanliness. Definitely take it home."}
{"text":"A true \"Hole in the Wall\" find that's worth the trip. Humble surroundings, excellent service and great food. We will be back"}
{"text":"Hot and sour soup is VERY spicy and VERY sour. (Always let H&S soup cool to a liquid consistency before getting the real experience.) Massive portions of shrimp w lobster sauce. Also, 10 crab puffs for only $3.99!! The place looks like it's been condemned at first glance but the attention they put into their food is evident, one of the best Chinese spots in the valley."}
