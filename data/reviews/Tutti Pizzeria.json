{"text":"This place has the best roman-style pizza in Toronto, by far. Hard crust, all natural flour, without sweeteners. Truly, an authentic slice of Italy in the heart of Yorkville! Goes well with their birra artigianale!"}
{"text":"I work in Yorkville and as we all know it can get expensive for lunches here, as there are not a lot of deals happening. 

When I found this place and found out you can get a gourmet slice for $7.50 - I was sold! 

Great little place for lunch, where you can have a coffee or beer with a slice and sit, relax, people watch in Yorkville."}
{"text":"What is with the high star reviews for this place? I had the margherita pizza and a meat pizza both were extremely mediocre. The dough was too doughy for the thickness of the pizza and the cheese is plasticky. It didn't help that we got the pizza slices lukewarm. I suppose I could have asked for it to get reheated again....

Did I order the wrong pizzas? Should I have asked for a fresh pizza instead of ordering the reheated slices? 

I would have much rather have headed down to Yonge St and gotten a slice from a Pizzaialo chain or dare I say it....even Pizza Pizza would be be preferable to this slice....and I'm the type to not even redeem my free slice when the raptors score 100 at the ACC.

This is a rare case where I will respectfully disagree with the majority of yelpers who reviewed this place."}
{"text":"one word yummy!

i love this place! 

I hope this place does really well - two guys at the counter were funny and genuine, and they deserve a lot of business."}
{"text":"The prices are fairly cheap for the area. I got the chicken Panani which was very good . The only really problem for me was the portion didn't fill me up . The food was really good and I will buy again when I'm near by."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. If you have the chance definitely eat here. The pizza is fantastic, they heat it up for you in a pizza oven so it's perfectly warm when you get it. The staff were friendly and we got our food quickly. The restaurant interior is beautiful, they have these fantastic marble countertops and great light."}
{"text":"The service is great. They just opened about two weeks ago. They have fresh ingredients. However the pizza itself is not that great- the dough is bread style with dry tomato sauce and not enough cheese, if any...It's definitely not Italian style pizza. For that price per slice you should expect more."}
{"text":"Tutti Pizzeria is everything that you would expect of a pizzeria in Yorkville.

* Gorgeous and modern interior (and a nice outdoor seating area)
* Top notch imported ingredients
* Impressive Yorkville prices ($7.50 per pizza square)

I had the pesto pizza \"Verde\" which was topped with broccoli, spinach, and ricotta. 
They drizzled olive oil on top and it was so delicious!
I could have eaten two more slices, lol!

I asked them a few questions about their pizza after reading the ingredients literature.

It stated that Tutti Pizzeria has \"lower carb\" pizza crust.
The flour is from Italy and mixed with a soy flour, and therefore considered a\"lower\" carb crust.  

Apparently, they use water from New York to make the pizza.
However, the NY water is blended with Toronto tap water... 
I guess it's a premium east-coast urban blend!

Anyways, this is a great place to grab a slice and people watch! :)"}
{"text":"In a celebrating mood and walked into this cafe (?). Very authentic Italian feel and pizza!! Can't ask for more when you are having a huge craving for healthy pizza! Definitely will come back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is always great. They use superb, fresh ingredients and their crust is amazing. I would call it a focaccia crust. Lots of veggie options. Their staff have always been polite and efficient. It's a bit pricey, but you're paying for good ingredients and an expensive location.  Can't even imagine what their rent would be. And it's a BIG hearty slice. Save room for coffee at Sorry Coffee, almost next door."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Italy here in Toronto, this Real Italian Restaurant is the place to be!! From its outstanding ambiance to its fresh, health, real italian food! 

If you're a pizza lover, and for those who are carb conscious but love to eat pizza, then you must try their low-carb, high protein pizzas! :)  You can choose from their wide varieties! My personal choice is Funghi! This pizza is topped with handful of mushroom! 

I also recommend their Spinach Salad which has a  dressing from Italy! (I researched it because i really like it!) 

You must also try their Panini, Smoothies, and Pastries! 

Overall, this Italy Restaurant that has been  brought in Toronto is the BEST PLACE if you're  looking into healthy food that you will really enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited! They have vegan options!
Just got the kale salad with peppers, edamame, carrots and a vinaigrette and it was really delicious, fast, and reasonably priced. The place is immaculate and clean, as always. Staff are super friendly. I'll be back, especially now that I know they have really good vegan/veg options!"}
{"text":"Not sure about Roman vs. Neopolitan, or low carb dough, but I know food and flavour.

These guys? They definitely know flavour and what do to with quality ingredients. Properly good food, done correctly!

Absolutely recommended."}
{"text":"Yay, just what yorkville needed!

Another overpriced food pharmacy. 
Follwing the closing of Letierri on the corner, the little posh park on Cumberland
yelled for place to sell an americano for four-count 'em - $4!

Who do you think you are, Sam James?!?

No prices on the food on display to avoid sticker shock, 
and sulky service make this a PERFECT MATCH FOR YORKVILLE!"}
{"text":"I have reconsidered my position on the crust and texture of the pizza. Having frequented this pizzeria a few times now I realize that the feel of the pizza is consistently excellent. And exactly what one would expect from a top-notch pizzeria such as this."}
{"text":"The great reviews for this spot are baffling to say the least. The only reason one can probably understand the positive feedback is the price point maybe. 
I tried the margherita and mushroom slice here.
First of all the are impossible to eat with the plate and utensils they provide here as the crust is thick and the plastic knife and paper plate don't help much either
The setup is familiar and almost unchanged from the days of MBco. The pizza was a step above the pizza pizza offerings and greasy. The basil on the Margherita had almost gone bad and had to be tossed away. Mushrooms didn't fare much better. Just an awful awful place to get a slice.
Nothing to see here folks keep walking."}
{"text":"Tutti Pizzeria has opened its doors at last, and the aroma of pizza baking in the splendid red pizza oven makes us crazy with desire.

Yorkville residents and passers-by have been peering into the windows of Tutti. Waiting impatiently. Admiring the gleaming red and white Italian tile interior, the marble counters and tables, the shelves filled with imported olive oils, Italian beer and wine. Clearly evident, is the brilliant design of Irfan Bukhari, of Bukhari Design Inc., one of the more creative minds making their mark hereabouts.

Tutti is the crème de la crème of pizza parlours. It all starts with the flour. Exclusively 
formulated for them, it is all natural with no sugar added and is shipped in its original state from Italy. That's when it falls into the professional hands of Francesco Santocono, recent winner of the World Cup of Pizza held in Rome, and official consultant of the Italian Pizza Association in Rome. The process of making the dough, mixing in some soya flour for a lower carb crust, and allowing the proper fermentation process to occur, takes time. From the day the dough is kneaded to the day the pizza is eaten takes four to five days 

And here's the good part. Manager, Marco Mariani explains that the selection of TUTT-PIZZAS toppings is classic and authentic and all $6.75. The San Danielle proscuitto is from Friuli; the tomatoes are San Marzano; the cheeses are Italian, for example Parmigianno Reggiano is from Parma. From Trieste comes the Theresianer beer, and there is the Collisi four glass bottle in brown or blonde. Perfectly matched to pizza. But there is more: salad of the day, proscuitto sliced to order; charcuterie and cheese trays; home made canolli and tiramisu, and even a Nutella sandwich if that's what you crave.

TUTTI-PIZZERIA I'm sitting at the marble counter, toying with the wall mounted i-pad. I am loving the flavors and texture of my pizza funghi and sipping a glass of San Jovese, the $7.00 by the glass, house wine. Looking through the windows at the Cumberland park and the comings and goings of Yorkville area shoppers, makes this about as perfect an Italian experience as you can get in a Toronto restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great! Delicious pizza of all genres. It has a very open and friendly atmosphere. Service was very kind and fast for quality products. It is a little pricey but it's worth every bite! They were very knowledgeable about each type of pizza they offered and the ingredients! I'll definitely make this a go to grab and go spot when in this neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"Tutti tries to find a middle ground somewhere between a fresh gourmet pizza and the convenience of a utility slice.  It's a middle ground that doesn't really work for me. It's more crust than I want from a utility slice yet not gourmet enough to divert me from heading towards a wood fired pizza. 

The pizza here is approaching deep dish style, but with classic Neapolitan toppings. Like any good deep dish pizza, there's enough oil in the crust to ensure a crisp crunch on the bottom and the crust is substantial enough to ensure a doughy feel in the centre. It's a satisfying mouthful with pleasing textures and high quality toppings.  

With the park outside and beer available, it's a nice upscale slice. I can see why it's popular among Yorkville shoppers.  But I prefer Neopolitan-style pizzas, and the prices are close enough.  

The quality here is definitely higher than typical slice franchises, but it's nowhere near the experience of biting into a slice that is fresh from the oven. I'd rather sit down to a fresh Neopolitan pizza if I'm out for a meal or, if I'm just grabbing a slice, save a few buck ands grab a high-end utility slice elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very nice staff. My wife dropped her pizza as she was sitting down (distracted our baby) and one of the staff just grabbed us a replacement."}
{"text":"This newly opened pizzeria serves pizza by the slice and is advertised as Roman style (opposed to the Neapolitan style that Toronto has been seeing over the past few years).  Like many quick service places, the pizzas are pre-made and displayed behind glass. Diners can choose what they want and staff will heat it for them and there's lots to choose from.  One slice is cut into two pieces after it is heated up and is fairly decently sized for lunch. The crust is fairly crunchy and a bit thicker than many gourmet places (but thinner than the older school pizza restaurants)."}
{"text":"I've been a little frustrated with Tutti because they aren't open on Sundays, closed for an entire month and close fairly early. I wanted to give them a 4 star review but I just can't. The pizza is too good.

Love the design in here. The pizza isn't particularly cheap, but it's completely reasonable for the area.

The real winner here is the quality and taste of the pizza. The bread is excellent, just the right amount of crispiness. And the ingredients are of very high quality.

The only other pizza I've tried in Toronto that's similar is Ciao Roma in Vaughan, but this is even better. 

Tutti's a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"This place is in a really nice area, and has a great atmosphere. Everything looks amazing, and the food was great too! My only qualms are that the seating isn't particularly large, and prices aren't as low as one would like. But again, it was a great place relax. Will deffo come again"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places ever! Whenever I'm in the yorkville area I try to stop into tutti if I can! Located judt North of bloor street lies a mimic italian small pizza shop. The pizzas here have a super Crispy base and crust. I always go for the mushroom fungi because of the taste of truffle oil and the last time my fiancee got the pepporini. Once ordered you pay and they put it in their oven to warm up/ make crispy. Generally it is a quick meal and staff are Generally friendly.

The only downfall is each slice cost about 8.50$ so it is very pricey for a slice of pizza! But... the taste does Trump!"}
{"text":"Does anybody know what happened or why Tutti closed? I need pizza!"}
{"text":"It's ooopen!!! I can't explain how excited I am that this place has finally opened their doors. It's right by my work and it combines two of my favourite things during a busy day; quick and delicious. The options are perfect and the combination of flavours bring me back to my travels around Italy. Everything is just SO fresh and the dough... is seriously next level. Aside from the pizza they offer, charcuterie boards (I mean, who doesn't love that!), sandwiches and traditional Italian desserts. Oh, and the house wine is pretty fantastic. All in all, this place is perfect for a quick bite or an extended lunch when you just need to get away from the office.  I believe they're open until 9pm so it's also a nice quick dinner to pick up for those lazy night.

Give it go - you won't regret!"}
{"text":"How could something so delectable be low carb? Yes, you heard me, low carb pizza.  So that means there's more room for other carbs to eat, like a dessert.  I had the Funghi pizza because I felt like, it had the most cheese on it and I'm really greedy that way.  Instead of wolfing it down, I slowly savored every bite.  This is that type of pizza.  The type of pizza that ruins you for Pizza Pizza.  The decor, the beverage selection--everything is so neat! they have those little tiny bottles of tropical beverages, and they also have croissants for brunch. 

The fresh orange juice tastes delicious, like Sunny D without the vegetable shortening (it's true, they put oil in the drink, terrible!)  I also had a glass of white wine on the patio-- it was glorious. Also, there was a baby bird that got really close to my foot so you can tell the pizza is so good a baby bird would risk it's life for some delicious low carb crumbs.  

5 Stars!!"}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch and she recommended this new pizza joint in Yorkville.  I'll be really honest, I still crave it right now uuuuugccch the ingredients were so fresh wow!

We got the Bellair and Potato pizza.  They make a Romano style pizza, which has a hard crust rather than your thin crust.  I didn't think it would be so good but wow i just eating and eating.

i just salivated....really? man I might go get a slice tomorrow.

Aside from the wicked fresh pizza i was a amazed by the high ceilings and cool decor.  They told me they were going to open a 30 seat patio once the weather is warm. This place is going to be so cool in the summer, I can't wait!

I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I was in Yorkville this afternoon and dropped by the new Pizzeria Tutti.  I had the Diavola pizza and it was great.  The tomato sauce tasted home-made and the crust was just perfect.  From the selection in the pizza display case it is obvious they are using very fresh ingredients.  It's a refreshing upgrade in pizza quality.  The service was great and the pizza got to our table in the patio in no time.  Will definitely drop by next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"$9.89 for a slice of pizza? 
If they had 2.5 stars I'd go with that. 
9.89 is a lot, the slice was good but at those prices tough to return."}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. In. T.O.  Hands down.  And coming from my Italian husband, that this is the best pizza speaks volumes to me.  LOUD volumes :)  The attention to detail and quality is incomparable.  From the flour (which is imported from a place 45 min. south of Rome) used for the thin crust pizza, and the personal photos and poems on the walls, not to mention the homemade to-die-for tiramisu made 100% on the premises.  And if you're lucky like me today, you'll be greeted with smiles and helpful recommendations from the staff there.  !  WAY up!  

PS.  The location says 100 Bloor St, but it is more like the back side of Bloor facing Cumberland and the Bay/Bloor TTC entrance."}
{"text":"I recently visited this new pizzeria while in Yorkville and I absolutely loved it. I am always looking for new and delicious pizza to try and I have found the best. They have a wonderful array of fresh, authentic, Italian style pizza with ingredients straight from Italy. The décor is contemporary and fun with casual seating. There are fine Italian wines and espressos to compliment the selection of heavenly slices.

The menu is simply mouth-watering. I tasted a few different slices of pizza and all of them were like nothing I have had before. The potato, gorgonzola and fresh rosemary is unique and full of flavour. The Bellair (which just might be my favourite) is so fresh and very appetizing to look at. Picture perfect! The bufala mozzarella tasted just the way it does in Italy - fresh and creamy. The Funghi pizza was rich and flavourful with truffle oil and garlic - very delectable! The Capra was one I needed to try because it had three of my favourite ingredients - goat cheese, olives and sundried tomatoes. I enjoyed every bite! The other choices on the menu were equally as enticing, but had to be saved for the next visit (which will include tasting the homemade tiramisu!).

The crust on each slice was a perfect balance of texture - a little crunch from the warm crusty outside with a soft and doughy center - my idea of what the optimal pizza should have! An added bonus to this delightful pizza is that it is made with low carb, high protein dough with the flour coming straight from Italy. It is high in fiber and made with all natural ingredients and no added sugars. I was very happy to hear this because I know I will be eating here often and I won't feel so bad!

The price of everything is a very reasonable, especially considering the high quality of all ingredients and the obvious care that has gone into delivering an enjoyable experience. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere was very pleasant. I will be returning again very soon! Grazie Tutti!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. Great price. Great ambience. I had a good time. Cool servers too and fine fine  coffee."}
{"text":"Was really in the mood for a good coffee and sandwich. Dropped in here for the first time. Ordered a latte and a chicken Panini .  The coffee turned out to be warm, not hot, milk with a slight café flavoring. Not strong at all and tasted like it had 1 teaspoon of espresso in it. The panini turned out to not be a Panini but a cold roll with chicken, peppers, onions and mushrooms  with tomato sauce.  No real flavour.  And for $15, me think not!"}
{"text":"The food looks like 5* but tastes like 2*. My friend and I have been disappointed by the pizza. We were expecting something as good as it looks. The Crust was very dry and tough, way too much expansive for what it is. I'd have been okay if the slice was up to 4$ but at 7.5$ I'd have expect something of a better quality, I'm assuming we are paying for the location."}
{"text":"Okay Pizza, not particularly outstanded. Not sure what the hype is about except the decor is a great classy and modern Italian."}
{"text":"Good service, good food and spacious. It's a bit pricey (it's in Yorkville so not shocking). Great for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Finally a classic but healthy authentic Italian eatery for the health conscious pizza lover!!! 

Since I began my recent fitness journey there have been a fair few realizations along the way but one seemingly more painful then the rest and that being how much carbs can suck :( My beloved friend pizza has been one of my cheat meals for sometime now but thanks to Tutti, NO MORE!! Guilt Free pizza for everyone please and thank you!

This modern but quaint spot is nestled in the very heart of Yorkville, literally steps away from Goodlife and the TTC. Appearing to be torn straight from the streets of Milan this new addition is more then a welcome one to the community, with the patio jam packed on sunny weekends and serving Toronto daily with an authentic casual Italian experience it's quickly become a new Hot Spot and for good reason. The fresh and modern design is really eye catching but welcoming at the same time; bright red's balanced by crisp whites and a Roman influence in both aesthetic and taste makes the spot a special one. With handwritten menus, Italian quotes adorning the walls and conveniently placed iPads for guests entertainment,  the new meets old concept has really taken this small but dynamic cafe to a whole new level. 

What truly sets this little gem a part though is it's Menu with it's star being the one of a kind pizza with what I call \"magical dough\" ... it's stone milled from Italy, takes 96 hrs to ferment, low carb and high fibre with no sugar added and made using only natural ingredients. Passed down through decades of family lineage this recipe has been around since the 1950's and you really can tell the difference. It works out to being half the carbs of reg pizza and there are so many delicious combinations my head is still whirring! I tried four slices you ... really cannot stop at one slice and when your dealing with half the carbs why the heck would you?!? 

 - Margherita; Mozzarella, Tomato sauce, Basil and Oregano this good old stand by had a fresh new flare

- the Bellair; Real Bufala mozzarella cheese straight from Italy(still drooling!) , grape tomatoes, fresh basil, herbs and tomato sauce. This was my fav actually.... so light and fresh but flavorful 

- Potato; Golden potato, gorgonzola and fresh rosmary delight the senses with a heartier feel

- Prosciutto Cotto; French Ham, emmental, mozzarella, olive oil and tomato sauce this slightly saltier and savory slice was my bf's fav

Given I could not finish and only try all the slices as they are rather large, Sliced into two decent sized squares it's rather affordable at $6.95 considering the quality and quantity especially in Yorkville. They also have a full espresso bar, with a quality selection of wines and beers that I have yet to try...some delicious homemade desserts and another personal favorite of mine, Fresh squeezed orange juice... Yum! 

Ultimately the Passion of this place is really reflected in the quality ingredients they use and the friendly smiles of the staff make for a memorable experience so I most certainly will be returning very soon to try the 24 month aged prosciutto slice and a glass of wine with friends"}
{"text":"This place is great. I love pizza, and this place is very impressive in providing a great pizza at a great price. I had pizza and a latte, it was a great deal. The environment is great, service was beyond friendly and fast. Will definitely visits again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, great service, really decent pizza at a good price. And they have wine/beer, and a patio to drink them on! Winner."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, super friendly staff and amazing pizza.

Seriously, normally I'd think paying 9$ for a slice of pizza is absurd, but this place is definitely worth it."}
