{"text":"Located in the PPG Food Court.  This is one of the nastier places I have eaten at in Pittsburgh.  I believe in giving a place a few tries to make a good meal.  This joint falls ways short.  The employees are about as far from friendly as you can get.  They act somewhat offended and short that you actually placed an order.    The food- Gyro = literally made me barf Chicken salad = bland and old lettuce  Breakfast - Sausage is gross Bacon is precooked and gross (the lady said it is fresh then I see her microwave it) Eggs are decent. Bagel was a acceptable Coffee tasted like dishwater  The employees honestly seem like homeless people with a chip on their shoulders.  Could be welfare made them get a job and this joint is a welfare homeless preferred employer.  Avoid this place unless you are on a strict diet that requires you to throw up your food.  Might be good for gymnasts or circus freaks."}
{"text":"Located in Steel Plaza Grant Street  This was the nastiest place I have ever eaten in Pittsburgh. I think we could of had a better meal if we picked it out of the trash can in the back alley!!!! I had a fish, fries and a drink for $8.55!!! You think for that much you'd get a decent meal!!! The fish was dried out and had a funny taste. When they put the lettuce on they totally missed the fish. The fries were cold and soggy!! I threw it out. The only good part of the meal was the ice tea!! My friend had the gyro, fries and drink for $8.55!!! She picked the gyro up and the sauce just ran out of the gyro and was rancid! She had two bites and had to throw it out. Not to be graphic, but later on she lost her lunch. (If you know what I mean) And the associates were horrible. I thought the cook was gonna come out from behind the counter and fight my friend. He seemed alittle crazy!!!! Joe G. had it right in his review. It did seem like the place was a welfare homeless preferred employer!!! I could not even rate this place with one star because it didn't deserve it. I would like my money back but was afraid to go back and ask fearing I would be beat up by the employees. And don't we have a thing called A Health Inspector???? I guess he just passes this joint up when he comes to it. Unless the owner is paying someone off!!!!! Please avoid this place at all cost!! Total waste of money.   Food Qual  ity/Taste = 0 Stars shouldn't rate garbage Portion Size Given Price = 1 Stars gving it a one just because there was something in the container. Relative Price = 0 Stars Service = N/A Experience with Staff = 1 Stars crazy cook scared me!!!! Decor = N/A Clean (yes/no) = no"}
{"text":"This place is inside PPG Place's food court.   I had a Gyro ($6.20 with tax). It was pretty bad as far as Gyros go. The lettuce was browning, the cucumber sauce was runny and tasted weird, it had way too much grease on it. The cashier was obnoxious and would probably be happier unemployed. Also, she handles the cash and then goes and makes the food. Unless she was really sneaky, she did not don a pair of gloves during the process. Eck! It goes without saying, this is a place to avoid.  Food Quality/Taste = 1 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 3 Stars Relative Price = 2 Stars Service = N/A Experience with Staff = 1 Stars Decor = N/A Clean (yes/no) = probably not due to the cashier handling the food"}
