{"text":"I tried this place on a friend's recommendation and I wasn't disappointed! I am a sucker for a good chicken salad and for $4.99, I figured why not give it a try? Their chicken salad was piled high on fresh bread and has to be one of the best chicken salads I've tried. I also ordered the hand-cut fries with cheese sauce which were of course, amazing. All together, I had lunch for under $8 and I have left overs! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice this month. Everything we have ordered has been hot, flavorful, and heartily portioned. This place beats the chain sub shoppes, hands down."}
{"text":"My son asked if I would pick up lunch for him and his wife. When he suggested Dagwoods, I cringed as my previous experience, 13 yrs ago was not so hot.  However, the reuben was good.  Corned beef was very good.   My complaint is the place needs a scrubbing.  Same tables from when it was Arthur Treacher's Fish N Chips 16 yrs ago.  The guy who took my order must have flunked customer service 101.  I asked for a Turkey/Roast beef w/ Swiss and he replied, \"that ain't gonna happen\".  Instead of giving the customer what they want, he explained that the servings are portioned out and that sandwich would cost $11.  When my guest asked if anything came w/ the sandwich he growled, \"not at this price\".   Apparently, everything is extra.   My son had 3 bites of his Roast Beef and noted it was lousy.  I don't recall seeing anyone using gloves.  The owner must have naked pictures of the health inspector.     I drive by there twice a day and haven't been there in 13 yrs.  Hint. Hint."}
{"text":"Got the Dagwood. Pretty safe bet if a restaurant is named after something, its their signature dish. Defiantly not a fancy place, but if you serve good food, you don't have to be. My sandwich was really big and meaty, but sadly they forgot the bacon on there, which is admittedly my favorite part of anything. The bread on the Dagwood seemed like it wasn't quite cut out for the job. It was like a smart car hauling a boat, but the bread was indeed quite good, just could be a little bigger."}
{"text":"First time eating here foods good but god where they mean! I simply asked what a hard hat sandwich was she threw a menu at me said I don't have time for this! Then when I looked at the menu it didn't even say what was on it! So never going back"}
{"text":"Excellent, great location, lots of parking. Huge portions, you will get way more food for your money than at a chain, and everything is made to order (so be patient). I love the Dagwood sandwich, gyro is great too."}
{"text":"The bread at this place is TO DIE FOR.  I ordered a turkey and cheese sandwich and, first of all, it was huge.  Secondly, I took one bit of the sando and fell madly love in with the bread.  I walked back up to the counter to ask where they bought it from.  The owner smiled and said they bake their own bread.  He said they get a lot of requests for them to bake it but he said they could never satisfy the demand.  No frills interior--hard-sided booths and a stray Plain Dealer to read.  Moderate prices.  GREAT french fries."}
{"text":"Love this place. The Dagwood and hard hat are both awesome and cheap for the portion. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Sandwiches here are great, the service is horrible. The owner apparently works the counter and treats people like crap.  I got the New Orleans burger, delicious. When I asked the owner for napkins ( you will need many) he said \" they are right behind you, did you want me to get them for you\"  as if I were lazy or stupid, I just didn't see them.  Advise to the owner, don't treat customers like your the soup nazi, there are sandwich shops all over town."}
{"text":"Owner was very rude and condescending. In other words a total jerk. Will not be back even though sandwich wasn't too bad. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Just moved to Ohio and getting to know our little home of Parma. Read all the negative reviews and had to check this place out myself.  The owner isn't rude, he just feel like kissing butt. My boyfriend ordered the Dagwood and I the roast beef.  Freaking amazing! Huge sandwiches and fresh ingredients. Definitely recommend this especially if you want leftovers."}
{"text":"Get a hard hat, you will never eat at Mr. Hero again!!!!!this is dagwoods version of the romanburger. Restaurant however needs to be updated"}
{"text":"I've probably had 100+ sandwiches from Dagwoods. You can't go wrong here unless you're expecting to be treated like royalty when you walk in. It's a Sandwich shop in Parma people. Sure, the owner likes to bust balls and if you stare at the menu like your from mars he'll skip to the next customer, plain and simple. Personally I wouldn't care if he greeted me with \"hey asshole\" every time I walked in as long as the Sandwich was as good as usual.   We've had just about everything on the menu. The sandwiches are huge, the bread is awesome and the fries are fresh. The decor is as plain as it gets. The one wall is covered in local business ads and pictures of the Mizz. (Parma's WWF hero) If he wasn't related to the owner I'd be concerned about those photos but it is what it is....  If you want a good sandwich check this place out."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has been in business as long as it has without the health inspector shutting it down. The owner and him must be friends.The dining room ,trays and tables are gross and the owner is beyond rude.The sandwich was good but I've had better.i don't think it was good enough for me to go back."}
{"text":"I kept driving by this place telling myself I was going to stop and get food there, and it's finally happened. And I am glad I did.  Grabbed food for wifey and I - reuben, cheddar poppers, and the namesake, a dagwood. The wifey attests that the reuben is excellent. The poppers are the cornmeal coated kind and were very good. The dagwood is a monstrosity of food and was very good. It comes with coleslaw on it, lettuce, tomato, onion, ham, salami, turkey, swiss cheese and mayo. Anyhow, good food for under $20.  Place could be a bit cleaner, but I am pretty sure it is a husband and wife team and they are just too busy for detailed cleaning. Not a dirty place by any means; just needs a little TLC."}
{"text":"This place needs a lot more love for as good as it is. It's REALLY unassuming considering it's a small place in an overcrowded city like Parma, but this place is something else. Dagwoods is the first place I think of when I'm looking for a (big) sandwich. You won't find a better sandwich shop in town. The fresh bread puts it above other places that I love so much. The only thing I wasn't really a fan of was their corned beef, but I only tried it once and Danny's or Slyman's is the place to go for that anyhow.   Don't expect anything fancy inside, it is still Parma...and if you're going for a great sandwich, I'm pretty sure ambiance should be last on the list anyhow. It's clean though - they just put all of their attention into making incredible sandwiches instead of decorating.  Fine by me."}
{"text":"WILL NEVER RETURN, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. The owner is a douchebag, the food was soggy, the place looks like it hasn't been cleaned in forever, dead flies on the table!!! Gross, keep on driving past when you see this dump."}
{"text":"They make the best sandwiches. Only if they had longer hours it would be even better. The turkey sandwich is the best."}
{"text":"Without question the best corned beef in Parma. Nearly the equal of Slyman's, and at a smaller price."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, horrible service!! They are so mean!! I go here but when I do I hurry up and order cause the owners get frustrated if u take too long. They treat u like crap.  But they sure can make a great sandwich. If u go to this place, just go in , order quickly and get out. If u ask for anything extra, even napkins, watch out!"}
{"text":"The handcut fries here are great, and the sandwiches are very generous in portion - definitely round down if you're unsure about regular vs. large. The firebird has been my favorite so far, and everything here is made-to-order, so I'm already looking forward to trying more of the menu.   A word of caution: This place doesn't scale well in terms of getting many orders out at once, given the small staff/kitchen, so be ready to place all of your order up front, because if you think of something last minute that you want to add, it'll take just as long to cook the second part of your meal as it did the first."}
{"text":"This place is garbage! Think subway only worse! The place is a mess, they use the cheapest cold cuts they can find. The guy running the place thinks being rude gives his place character. I have to many greasy spoon places in philly and Chicago where being rude is their shtick.... But the difference is they offer good food."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are simply the BEST. However, I dined IN for the first time this current visit. The restaurant was very dirty. There were dead bugs, dust, and DIRT all over the window sills right next to where you eat. This ruined the taste of my very awesome sandwich. Additionally, the bathrooms appeared as though they hadn't been cleaned in over a month, so disgusting. It was so dirty I was afrai to wash my hands! Fortunately I was done eating, or I would not have been able to finish. Because of the rampant dirt it makes me question the cleanliness of the entire restaurant. If you are going to eat here, my advice is to enjoy your lunch OFF the premises."}
{"text":"We relocated back to Cleveland early last year, and went here today for lunch for my first time in 3 years. I remember it being dirty and dingy, the owner being rude, but ohhhh the sandwiches!!!   Since my last visit, things have vastly improved! The place is far cleaner than my previous memory of it, and the owner was down right pleasant to the point where I thought he was a new employee and my husband had to correct me. And the sandwiches are everything I remember and more!   Even if nothing had improved as it has, I still would never pass this place up.   I highly recommend the Firebird Chicken sandwich, and my husband lives by the Hard Hat."}
{"text":"Breaded mushrooms. Turkey sandwich. Can't go wrong. Fresh ingredients, friendly owners. Love it!! At least a once a month stop. It's a deli, don't expect fancy."}
{"text":"The dining room is repulsive.  I was so turned off by the filth that it completely ruined the experience. Less than halfway in to my 7\" sandwich a cartoon-angel appeared on my shoulder telling me to toss it and run.  I couldn't care less about decor but when everything in sight is dirty, greasy tables, sticky floors, dead bugs and a char caked grill I can't do it.   Mind you, I've eaten at street taco stands in Tijuana and felt safer.   Had someone carried out for me I probably would have liked it."}
{"text":"Just joined Yelp in order to comment on the rudeness of the manager. It felt like he was trying to belittle me.   I used to go here all the time when I lived in Parma, but after today I'll go somewhere where the customer is respected."}
{"text":"Dagwood is a great place to grab a really awesome big sandwich. Every sandwich I have tried is delicious and you get a lot for your money. I have heard negative reviews about the owner but he is actually really nice. He is just really abrupt, to the point and likes to make sure people get their orders correctly and out in a timely manner. If you like Roman Burgers- try the Hard Hat. The gyro is really good as well!!! My only complaint is the hours. They are usually only open for lunch until 3 or so. This place would be a great late night place to stop at while on a Parma bar crawl."}
{"text":"The Dagwood and the Gyro are my favorite sandwiches here! The french fries remind me of carnival fries and they even have the malt vinegar to go with them."}
{"text":"just simple ...Good....Food...:) just had the Firebird Chicken sandwich.....pretty good...starting a pork and beef free lifestyle"}
{"text":"I will never go back here again.  I stopped in with my mom to get a hard hat and fries after not having it for years, as we always enjoyed it.  The first thing I immediately noticed was the filthy tables and floor.  The tables had grease and crumbs and the floor looked as though it hadn't been swept in a while.  As if that wasn't enough, the man behind the counter was extremely rude when my mom specified what she wanted on her sandwich, like she should know everything that comes on it.  My mom had apologized for not knowing and he replied \"I don't care.\"  He treated all the regular male patrons with respect, but I guess it's too much to ask to be nice to someone new who is being polite and patronizing YOUR restaurant.  We should've just walked out of there at that point, but we still decided to give it a chance.  We got our food and it was extremely underwhelming.  Barely anything on the sandwich and over greasy fries.  From now on, I'll just be patronizing Mr Hero for a delicious romanburger or one of the many other local delis that actually value their customers."}
