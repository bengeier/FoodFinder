{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday and took my plate to go. It has a good amount of selections for what your looking for and the price is really decent. I paid $11 and got a full plate of food. They have everything, shrimp chicken wings BBQ pork two different types of noodles fried rice broccoli mix spring rolls vegetable rolls and few more things that I can't remember right now it was only my first time lol but everything that I got tasted really good and I'll definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Only have picked up from here, the dinner for 3 meal, and it was incredible. Food was prepared extremely fast, very helpful, and AMAZING!! Its a shame that more people don't know about this place the price is amazing. The food is amazing and the service is amazing."}
{"text":"I mean cmon, this place should have at least one review..
I give it 3.5 stars.. It is what it is.. Truck drivers filling containers of gui lau Chinese food to go.. I dined in and downed two plates. Noodles were better than food court, good bbq pork, decent chicken ball, broccoli was crisp and fresh... And most important, no MSG headache driving home... It is what it is.. I'll be back.."}
{"text":"We ordered and picked up after having read good reviews and were very disappointed. Fried rice tasted cooked and recooked and burnt ... egg roll tasted gross - couldnt finish it ... cold inside, hot outside ... and a weird spice flavour ... beef broccoli was ok except broccoli were overdone and chicken chop suey seemed to be missing chicken. Wouldnt order from here again despite good prices."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese food restaurant! Usually, when ordering we take out in large amounts and it's always ready on time. Family owned business and they're super friendly when dealing with their customers.  The restaurant has your typical Chinese restaurant menu items such as egg rolls, spring rolls, chicken balls, mixed vegetables, rice, ribs, general tao chicken, and chicken wings.  They're very dependable and it's a spot worth checking out if you're looking for some takeout for a small or big group.  Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area to try em' out!"}
