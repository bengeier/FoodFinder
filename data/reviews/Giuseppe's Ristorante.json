{"text":"The food is outstanding! Pastas, fish, it's all authentic and delicious. Five stars would have been awarded but the service is lacking.  Great service at the beginning of dinner. But we ordered entrees and appetizer at 6:15 and literally waited nearly one hour for the entrees to arrive after the salad.  I don't always mind a two hour dinner but when you sit for an hour with no one checking to see if you need water or to provide an update on your order, it's not an enjoyable experience. We chose not to order more wine, coffee or dessert for fear of sitting another hour."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Very reasonably priced for the portion sizes. Make sure to save room for dessert, the crepe was amazing! After being there for a long time I forgot my purse was hanging on the back of the chair and luckily the owner ran it out to me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! It is amazing!! When you come here you can not be In a rush, it is a family owned place and all the workers are very nice. If you are looking for an amazing meal you have to come here."}
{"text":"I first started going to Giuseppe's about three years after a recommendation by an employee of a restaurant food distributor.  He lived quite far from the restaurant but was a regular.  After at least 10 visits I have to agree with a previous review that Giuseppe's may have the best Italian food in Cleveland.  I am a creature of habit and almost always order a veal dish there.  It practically melts in your mouth.  There has to be some serious pounding done to get the veal that tender.  I also regularly order the snails which is served in a garlic sauce.  This is a habit of mine again since I have found very few restaurants in the area that serve snails.  I do have to agree with other reviews that food prep. time (from ordering to service) can be a bit lengthy.  In fact one early Sunday we were the only table and it took nearly 40 minutes to get our entrees (two people).  However, it really is worth the wait."}
{"text":"We starting coming to Giuesspes about 8 years ago. Since then, it has become one of our favorite places to dine. Food is cooked per table, which gives your dining experience a time to relax, and unwind with a glass of wine. The Ripa family are amazing, along with the servers. The food comes out piping hot and fresh.  The desserts are all made in house by Rosaria. Every one is amazing. Don't miss this hidden jewel in a small shopping strip."}
{"text":"Kind of an odd location tucked away in the midst of a small strip mall next to a gun shop but don't let that turn you away.  The food is great!  Never disappointed with the food and the atmosphere is cozy. Sometimes too cozy though  as the seating is limited.  It's a small place.  It seams like earlier in the week is a better time to go as they are always packed when we go Thursday's or Friday's.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the service is a little slow sometimes.  Especially when they get swamped. One time it took 2 hours to get in and out but they had a big party of like 16 people at one table that night.  Overall it's a great place though. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We are from the West Coast and here visiting friends who suggested the restaurant.  It was excellent; my wife had calamari & shrimp,  friends had veal & ravioli and I had lasagna.   Minestrone soup excellent,  just like Nona makes it.   We trade tastes,  as good as I have had in Italy or little Italy in New York!  Wine was great. I would recommend the restaurant to anyone who loves great, authentic Italian food. Ron 8/27/2014."}
{"text":"No matter how good food is anywhere, terrible service can overshadow that.  My husband and I had a 7:45 reservation.  Got seated and waited 15 minutes to even be greeted by our server.  We watched several tables who were seated after us including a large party of 6 get appetizers and dinner before our calamari even came out.  We ended up getting our food to go two hours later.   Very disappointed in this restaurant and will never go back.  Don't waste your time, literally it's a waste of a lot of time!"}
{"text":"After kicking mud around CVNP all day, my gf and I were very hungry, and not being a local.. we Yelped our way into Giuseppe's. We actually passed it on our way there. DO NOT judge this place by it's non-descript/strip-plaza facade! The interior is intimately lighted with toned down accent lights and service-lit table candles, while quietly beautiful music completes the ambiance.  My gf and I were (possibly?) underdressed.. we were definitely the only ones in jeans/tees/hoodies. Everyone else was business casual and probably twice our age. Anyways, none of this mattered.. Because we received impeccable service none-the-less. Our server was extremely informative about the menu and shared an extensive list of the 'specials' with us.   I ordered the penne peppers/sausage special and it was amazing! My gf tweaked one of their menu-dishes and it came out perfect. They even put the artichokes on a side dish for her, aka- for me, cause she loathes em.. And I obviously feel differently ;)  Perfect service + Perfectly cooked food = the Perfect way to wrap up a beautiful spring hike thru CVNP :)"}
{"text":"OMG! This is the best Italian food around Northeast Ohio.  Eaten at many Italian restaurants around the area and can't wait to go back.  The fresh bread was delicious.  Salads were nice and fresh but the entrees, were phenomenal.  My wife had the Pollo alla fiorentina (Spinach Egg Battered chicken in butter sauce) and I had the Pollo alla marsala (Chicken Marsala).  We each loved our dish and also each others.  If no one was around I would have seriously drank the leftover sauce off the plate, it was that good.  Perfect portion size, along with a nice side of pasta with a light marinara sauce.  Loved it.   Overall, great dining experience.  Even sat in the small bar area and was able to watch the cooking.  Would go back tomorrow.  Wait, I am.  Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Our experience was very uncomfortable.  Our complaint is more about the owner than the food which seems to be the same as other bad ratings.  We have eaten there 3 times and never felt welcome.  Each experience got worse.  On our 3rd  visit, my husband  sent a fish dish back because it was spoiled.  She made him feel like he did something wrong.  She also charged him $9.00 for a rum and coke.   You get the feeling she is more interested in getting you in and out so she can seat someone else (even though it was during the week and they were not busy).  You can't treat customers like she does and expect the to come back."}
{"text":"Have heard out this restaurant a few time & decided to check it out with friends on one of my trips through Cleveland and really glad that I did.  The food was authentic & service was great, my only complaint about the experience was how long it took to get a table even though we had a reservation (Highly recommend getting one if you're planning on visiting)."}
{"text":"My wife and I are longtime fans. I read earlier comments.  In my opinion, those reviews were accurate and  truthful. The restaurant is European in style and authentic.  Do not expect to be done quickly. Plan to spend time dining, not simply eating. It is not a restaurant for young children, teenagers, or even someone less than 21 years of age. Plan to have a glass of wine, an appetizer and conversation with your spouse, your date or your friends.  The food is great; and the wines and food are very fairly priced.  Although locals frequent the restaurant because of its quality, Guiseppe does not want to expand as he wants to manage everything personally. Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal from start to finish; the restaurant has a very warm, cozy atmosphere and the service was great. Each dish was expertly prepared; nothing too salty or overpowering-just really spot on and served at perfect temperature. We will be back for sure; lots more on this generous menu we want to try!"}
{"text":"BEST Italian food around. The food is made to order by Giuseppe himself! Delicious authentic Italian food. The restaurant is small and has a rustic ambiance. Since the food is made to order I would recommend giving yourself a few hours for dinner but it is well worth the wait and the bread is wonderful! There are always amazing specials. I recommend getting the escargot appetizer and a fish special. They have homemade desserts; crepes, tiramisu, cannolis and usually a seasonal special dessert.  If you have never been here I suggest you try it and if you have been here then you know what I am talking about!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. The place seems to have a lot of regulars so give yourself plenty of time as you won't get served quickly. But well worth the wait. Excellent authentic Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Our friends eat here all the time and rave about it. I finally got to see what the hype was about last night when we decided to join them. I am definitely a food snob and appreciate fine authentic Italian. This is the best italian I have ever had. I have eaten in Vegas and other big cities, and this quant, modest little restaurant blew me away. I had cavetelli with sausage and peppers with the tastiest sauce I have ever had. I soaked my plate up with the scrumptious warm crusted bread. Im not a big veal guy, but I tried a bite of my friends, and it was melt in your mouth phenomenal. My wife had chicken and artichokes with a lemon caper butter sauce.....another homerun!!! I ended my meal with a very nice cup of cappacino and crepes with nutella and ice cream. I almost had a cigarette after the meal, because it was like having the best sex, but instead of sex....it was great dining!!!"}
{"text":"My ancestry is Italian. My mother was a great cook.  This place is the best Italian restaurant in Cleveland. Do not expect fast-food and expect to wait to have your food prepared since each meal is expertly prepared as it is ordered. On top of all that, it is not very expensive."}
{"text":"Walked in, they looked at us, didn't acknowledge us and continued doing what they were doing. Stood there awkwardly until someone Sat us. Very small place. Got the ahi tuna appetizer that was cooked all the way through. Our server was nowhere to be seen so we asked the other one and she said it's supposed to be that way. I've never had ahi tuna cooked all the way. I can believe the chef let it go out to our table. The veal marsala was decent. Barely saw our waitress. I've lived in the area my whole life and finally made it out and was very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is *the* place for high-quality Italian food within a 45 minute radius. Don't come here expecting cheap & fast food, but if you're willing to spend the time and money on a true Italian dining experience, then treat yourself.  Otherwise, go back to Olive Garden, you savage."}
{"text":"Never knew this place was here - I drove down 82 for 2 years on my way to work and never noticed it. A small little Italian restaurant tucked away in a plaza. Cozy and intimate atmosphere, great mood setting and an attentive wait staff. I had a great time here, BUT (and that's a big pause), be prepared to wait. We made reservations at 7, and we had an event to go to at 10 p.m., and we BARELY made it there in time. We had a party of 5, which isn't terrible, but with a very small kitchen and a small space, it was a larger party. We order some wine, apps, salads (which come with most dishes) and main dishes. The apps came out about 45 min after we ordered them. The salads took another 45 minutes after that (like, it's a salad - how hard can it be?), and then the dishes took almost another 45 minutes after that. I ended up filling up on bread (which was fresh from the oven and delicious) before my meal even came out. But when it did eventually get delivered (I got the gnocchi and artichokes in pesto sauce, \"Gnocchi al tegamino\"), it was so amazing and totally worth the wait. I think I died and went to heaven, that is how good it was. So that is why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 3 for the wait. My mom got the meatball and pasta dish (\"Cavatelli con polpette\"), as did one other gentleman at our table, and they both said it was the best pasta dish they ever had. My dad had the \"Linguine all' aragosta\", which he said was also worth the wait. The last woman at our table had one of the veal dishes, which she said was amazing. So overall, wait could have been much less - but it was worth it in the end."}
{"text":"A charming hidden gem. It's in a strip mall next to a gun store - you might miss it - but the service and atmosphere are wonderful.   I had the calamari fritti, veal Marsala and tiramisu. Everything was great!  Overall this place is perfect for special occasions with its romantic candle lit tables, delicious and authentic Italian food, reasonable wine prices and terrific desserts."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place and give 5 stars! The environment may not be very outstanding but quite, silence and warm. All dishes I try are very very delicious and special! You must go to this place and try everything!"}
{"text":"Our neighbor recommended this little Italian restaurant.  It is a small place easily missed on route 82, but it is excellent. The veal piccata is not on the menu but was a special  it was as good as any I have had. The escargot was also very good as was the rest of the meal. I highly recommend the food.  The place is small and the service is sometimes slow."}
{"text":"This place has the best and most authentic Italian food in the area.  The place is tiny but the food is great.  Service is friendly.  Not an everyday place though because it is not cheap by any means. We go here on special occasions.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Talk about a diamond in the rough! I can't believe there aren't more reviews for this very authentic Italian restaurant del sud. My Italian immigrant family and I are all enamored with this place, and I would consider it to be one of the top 3 Italian places in Cleveland, hands down.  For instance, my Nonna and I came here for takeout today, as we were both craving seafood risotto but were short on time. At 20$ for a generous dinner portion teeming with squid, shrimp, mussels and clams, as well as delicious salad and freshly baked pillowy ciabatta, this is a bargain. And the taste is heavenly. By the time we came home, the food was still piping hot. The arborio is perfectly cooked, with a delicious herby sauce emitted during the cooking process, and finished with fresh tomato, onion and parsley. The flavors are just spot on-bold but not overpowering, with tender seafoods, and finished with just the perfect amount of parmigiano, king of cheeses.  Enjoyed with a crisp pinot grigio, this is one of the best meals I have ever had that I could easily muse about for years to come. I just can't say enough about this lovely place for those of you who are looking for a warm environment to enjoy an impeccable dinner with lovely family service when I have dined in. Worth it every time.   Hopefully they will add some rabbit onto the menu as an exchange for this glowing review ;)"}
{"text":"Went back for a family dinner of three after a great business lunch a month or so ago.  We had an escargot appetizer, house salads, spaghetti and meatballs, veal piccata and chicken in a lemon cream sauce. The latter two plus the appetizer were \"specials\".  Everything was wonderful for dinner and we followed-up with espresso and cannoli for dessert - both also very good.  With three glasses of premium wines the bill totaled $40/person not bad for a good restaurant.  Just one word of caution.  The wait between ordering and getting food is more lengthy than I would consider normal  However, the food is worth it and and the ambiance is dark and quiet, suitable for nice dinner conversation. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've found my new favorite Italian restaurant in the Cleveland area. My favorite used to be D'Agnese but that is getting old.  I love the atmosphere here. Cozy, Italian feeling. The food is authentic Italian and loaded with flavor. My only negative is the amount of time it took to get our appetizer but I think they make it fresh.  Give it a try! Lunch time is quiet here!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, and wanting to see what there was to eat around here besides Taco Bell and GetGo, I found this wonderful restaurant. Excellent food, good prices, and friendly staff. In all honesty, I can't recall the last time I've had better Italian cuisine. It's very good."}
{"text":"What a delightful immigrant style mom, pop, son and daughter ristorante that will blow your taste buds out of the water. I had a caprese salad and grilled salmon and both were bursting with flavor. Can't wait to go back and taste the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype! I had been hearing good recommendations for this restaurant and decided to try it for dinner. The food is overpriced, the pasta very watery, the sauce overly sour, the salad nothing special, the service slow and forgetful. I was even charged for extra bread! Are they real Italians?"}
{"text":"Went to Giuseppe's for my birthday. I was really looking forward to it. Great reviews and recommendations from friends. Great atmosphere with average service. A slow dining experience, so don't plan on getting a quick dinner. Just plan to sit back and relax for about an hour and a half or two. I wasn't impressed with the food. Started with two appetizers,  the fried calamari which was rubbery and bland and the fried smelts that were so tiny there was barely anything to eat. The salads were disappointing, a few torn romaine leaves with some shredded carrots and red cabbage. The balsamic vinaigrette was just balsamic vinegar and oil. Not worth eating. Main entrees, Penne Alla Amatriciana and Veal Marsala, both sauces lacking in flavor. Side steamed veggies were not cooked at all, very hard, raw. The side pasta was over cooked, literally mush (not edible). Finished with dessert  hoping to save the day with a Cannoli and Tartufo al limone. Just average not great. As a first generation Italian, I can't recommend this place. I was disappointed. I should have gone to Little Italy, nothing beats Angelo's Nido Italia!"}
{"text":"After seeing how highly rated his place is, I decided to come for dinner. Ordered the gnocchi, calamari, and eggplant dish.  The calamari looked great, but was like chewing rubber. The gnocchi and eggplant dish weren't bad, but not great. Everything was very bland and under seasoned. Very underwhelming."}
{"text":"We wanted to come back here because we have been here a few years ago and thought the food was fantastic.    I would echo a previous comment that the service is very slow.  They weren't crowded so I am not sure why it was so slow.  It is nice to have a leisurely pace, but this was excessive.  Our server was very sweet, and suggested a wine which fit our taste perfectly and was reasonably priced.  The food was 4 or a scale of 5.  Quite good, but not \"out of this world good\".  I must confess we are very hard to please, so a 4 of 5 for Italian food is a very good score.  The ambiance is quiet, with no TVs or distractions.  Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a place with a slow pace."}
{"text":"We finally got a reservation for a table at 5pm on a Saturday (we had been twice before and had to sit at the sad bar in the other room by the bathroom).  The food here is delicious, but the place is small and very dark.  It's mostly filled with an older crowd, probably longtime diners of this family-owned restaurant.  My complaint is that the portions are way too small to justify the high prices, especially for the neighborhood.  It seems to do well so there's no reason for them to lower prices given their loyal customers.  It may perhaps be because there aren't many non-diner eateries in the area.  In the future, I may try takeout, which is a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food outside of Italy !!  Everything is handmade and absolutely delicious!!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointing! Where to begin? Met friends here (halfway point/eastside/westside) because we had heard fabulous reviews about this restaurant (food) and waited over a hour and half (in a pathetic \"bar\"/corner of kitchen) past our reservation time. It took about a hour to get served a drink there. While we frequent private/non chain restaurants and truly appreciate good service and food the service/management/owners is where they truly fell flat. Not only did it take forever to get food (we like slow service but this was at a hault) everything took insanely long - food never did come out together and frankly neither the server or owner seemed to care. That's a shame. We have never experienced worse service in a private establishment.  The food itself was fine (nothing we really can rave about that was above and beyond). The experience could have been completely changed by a staff that cared and valued new clients."}
{"text":"Food was great & fresh. Prices are reasonable especially for the large portion sizes. Small location, so get there early if you don't have resrvation. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation we decided to check this place out on our way to a show at the Hard Rock Rocksino. We arrived 2 hours before the show started and got seated right away since we did made a reservation. We told the woman, whom we found out was the owner, that this was our first time dining with them. We were sitting for at least 15 minutes before being greeted by our server. The worst part was the owner stood at her post the entire time and didn't come to see why we hadn't been greeted. We ordered a bottle of wine and had to wait another 10 minutes for that. We decided to forego the appetizer because of this.   We ordered, and waited for the bread and salads. The house salad was nothing remarkable and the caeser salad was not worth the upgrade charge. We were finished and the owner cleared our plates and offered us some more bread (which we never got).   At this point we had only 40 minutes till our show and the server came over to tell us we were next and we explained that we were trying to get to a show and we couldn't wait. The owner heard this and went in the back and magically appeared with our food.   There was nothing remarkable about the food. The veal was okay but the pasta was terrible. If you like tomato sauce with flavor, do not expect to get any here. Overall we did not have a great experience nor were we amazed with the food. There are plenty of other Italian restaurants in the area that will leave you much more satisfied."}
{"text":"Meh...  We were here for 2 hours, which I don't mind if the food that comes out is amazing.   It was mediocre.   I had the special, chicken and mushroom risotto in a tomato cream sauce.  Very bland, the only flavor came from the diluted tomato soup mix.  My bf had a seafood garlic dish which was much better, had a nice garlic bite to it.  The calamari fritti was fishy smelling and tasting, although very tender.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I am Italian and this is by far the BEST Italian restaurant in the Akron/Cleveland area. I have been to many Italian restaurants in Little Italy and downtown Cleveland, and in my opinion, this blows them out of the water!! I think the food is a bit pricey, but completely WORTH IT!!! The owner is from Italy and he cooks all of the meals himself, from scratch - he is AMAZING and such a wonderful man!! The wait can be awhile for the food, and I think this is because it is truly an authentic Italian restaurant, nothing is rushed; it is cozy and classy, and a perfect place to enjoy time with your friends, loved one and/or family. Giuseppe takes great pride in his food and his Cavatelli is my absolute FAVORITE in this world!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this little place! We arrived in for a late dinner around 8pm so it wasn't very crowded. Naturally, the service was very personalized and friendly. And the food was excellent. We had appetizers and entrees. My favorite was the smoked salmon with pasta.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a late afternoon and we're seated immediately.  Nice young man server.  Appetizer we had Eggplant roll ups   they were delicate and delicious.   The stuffed peppers were fun and spicy.  The house bread is ciabbata breadbwhich comes out warm  house salads were consistent and simple.  The entrée we good.  Desserts home made.   Very solid authentic."}
{"text":"Food was great all made to order, service was great with a moderate price. A little off the main road but really worth your time."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food, would recommend! Small restaurant so definitely place a reservation. Gave them 4 stars as had a 9pm reservation and was not sat till 9:30pm. However, waitress was very accommodating and attentive."}
{"text":"I have been there many times.  It is always amazing with great food and great service.  I like that the meal is served at a leisurely pace unlike American's the Italians know dining should be enjoyed, not rushed.  No, I am not Italian..just love the food and attitude.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you want a small intimate restaurant with outstanding food."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem Locally Owned Ristorante Giuseppe's Ristorante: The owners of this little gem are Giuseppe and Rosaria Ripa and are natives of Naples, Italy, and have been in the restaurant business since their time in Naples. The quaint little restaurant in a strip shopping center in Northfield is very unassuming, and in fact, if you are not looking for it, you'll pass it right up. Inside, however, the lighting is dim and romantic, with candle lighting and Italian music. The food is made from the freshest vegetables and herbs for a light, but delicious take on traditional favorites. With most entrees in the $15 to $30 range, this is a great place for an intimate dinner for two. The food and service was excellent. Carry on!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"What a great little Italian restaurant gem in the heart of Northfield! Right away, I was pleased with the welcoming ambiance when we entered, and we were soon presented with fresh bread to enjoy while we perused the menu.  I ask you...is there anything better than fresh-baked bread, hot from the oven??  The pasta I ordered was excellent (the chef even made it a bit spicy, per my request, and it was perfectly done), and the serving size was quite large...plenty enough to take home for a yummy late night snack!  My only regret was not trying the escargot special as an appetizer. I bet it was fabulous.  Whenever I'm home visiting family, I'll be sure to return to Giuseppe's to try some of the other dishes on the menu.  Also...special kudos to our server Ernesto.  He was efficient, pleasant, and spot on with his recommendations.  Well done, Ernesto!!"}
{"text":"Excellent...all 4 of us ordered something different & they were top rate dinners with unique selections  & culinary delights!  Loved our table, music, soft lighting, & very charming service."}
{"text":"So good! Some of the best Italian food I've had. Everything is well prepared and taste wonderful. The place is certainly small so don't expect to take a big party here and I'd call ahead, they maybe have twelve tables in the main dining area.  Also, be prepared to take your time, this is a quality experience and your food will take some time to be prepared but that gives you plenty of time to chat with your guests and enjoy the wonderful apps and drinks."}
{"text":"The food was incredible and the atmosphere was lovely. It's a small but beautiful little restaurant. We had Carly as a server and by far the best server I have ever had (and I used to be a waitress). I would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Such a random place to find amazing Italian but here it is! Great service and a quiet and cozy dining room. The bread was warm and delicious too! The food is flavorful and amazing! Some of the best Italian I have had. The desserts are also awesome, I had the limoncello sorbet and it was light and refreshing. Definitely a great place to eat if you live here or are just passing through"}
{"text":"My husband and ate at the ristorante and had a bad expierance.  The owner hovered over us, it made me feel that she wanted us to eat and leave.  I had the seafood, like a seafood soup, but with very little seafod in it, and VERY salty. My husband did not care for his meal either.  I'm glad we had a gift card, and did not have to pay for our meal.  It is a shame the we won't go back since the place is about 5 minutes from our home."}
{"text":"Went to Giuseppe's for the first time on Valentine's Day and maybe I have to give it another shot.  I want to like it.  No, I want to love it.    No problem with making a reservation, and holding the reservation. We had to wait a few minutes, but that's expected in a restaurant as small as this place.    I mentioned Giuseppe's is small.  It's probably 16 tables in the whole place.  I'd call that intimate.  So intimate that I felt like I was part of the table behind me.  The 4some was incredibly loud.  Not boisterous, not out of control, just loud.  So forget all that and get on with the food, right? This easily could have been a 5 star if I wowed by the food.  And you know what? That 3 stars are there for a reason.  The seafood risotto, Risotto alla Bella Napoli, was undercooked, and quite frankly lacked a bunch of seafood.  Maybe 2 shrimp? Light on mussels and clams.  The calamari was chewy.  The Gnocchi al Tegamino was better, with overall presentation lacking.  Service was middle of the road, and the wine selection is limited.  So yikes. So much potential but so much to be desired."}
{"text":"My friend and I were attending the Jason Bonham Led Zeppelin Experience at the Rocksino yesterday and naturally we wanted to have a nice dinner somewhere beforehand. We like to check out places unknown to us and being from Lorain county, this was definitely unknown. We both work at Nino's in North Ridgeville so we're huge Italian fans. Giuseppe's was awesome!   The atmosphere and décor was so elegant and charming. It was a cozy restaurant and I found the chairs very comfortable. The server was a nice and answered all of our questions well. He brought us out a small loaf of fresh, warm bread on a cutting board with a knife. He also provided a cup of fresh ground parmesan/romano and balsamic for dipping. We started out with eggplant rollups for an appetizer and they really got out palettes going. It was nice to get a taste of their house red sauce as that's always a good gauge for Italian. I found their sauce and flavorful. My friend's salad (I opted out as I'm not much of salad eater) was a bed of greens and carrots with balsamic; no complaints from her there.   Then we moved onto to our entrees: I had veal parmesan and she had a special which contained artichokes, chicken, and a lemon butter sauce I believe. My veal came with a small side of mixed vegetables and a comfortable side of linguini and she also received linguini. The portion size was nice in that if I really wanted to I could have finished and been overly stuffed or do what I did which was take half home and I just ate it for lunch. I really enjoyed it. I would have liked it if the veal's crust was a little crispier, but negligible considering that's minor and the meal was fantastic. My friend enjoyed her meal very much as well. I had a glass of their cabernet with my meal that went with it perfectly.   Finally we finished off our meal with their chocolate bread pudding topped with ice cream; wow! It was like a giant, fluffy brownie. It was very fresh and homemade tasting. We even stopped at their four person bar to get her a birthday shot before leaving and we got talk with some regulars there who also lauded the place. I look forward to coming here again when on this side of town again or maybe for a special date!"}
{"text":"So, my wife and I have been here twice and had decent experiences both times. First - the food is great. No doubt about it. The food is prepared by Giuseppe himself, and he takes his time in the preparation and it shows in the taste. You can't go wrong with the food.   My only problems with this place is that the wait staff is not the friendlist in the world. Not that they're rude, but just not very personable if that makes sense. Further, the wait for the entree is very long. Both times we waited over 35 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we were served. The quality of the food makes up for it, but it's still annoying.   If you go on a Friday or Saturday evening, call ahead for reservations. We did, and still had to wait 15-20 minutes, which I found annoying as well. Also, in the summer, they don't like to crank the air conditioning so it's very hot in the restaurant.   All in all, it's a good experience. The wait staff, the wait for the food, and the wait even with reservations is what prevented me from rating this place with more stars. If you love good, homemade Italian food, than try this place out. Just don't have high expectations for anything but the food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I world have rated a five if I would have ordered red meat. Amazing Italian. There apps were great. Great atmosphere. Relaxed and classy."}
