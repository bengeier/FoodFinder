{"text":"Today, I had the fortunate experience to dine at Opus Too.  This student-run (supervised by professional chefs/teachers) restaurant is white table cloth and fine dining.  For $10.95, you get a solid meal (appetizer, entree and dessert).    The room is small, but appointed nicely.  There are about 10 tables with a raised step area that has a piano.  I was the first customer and was seated right at the window to the kitchen where the food is prepared.  My server was Trey, a personable and charismatic gentleman who will do well in the culinary world once he graduates.  All the students were trained well in fine dining and service.   For my meal, I chose the Braised Beef Empanada (appetizer).  It was so delicious.  The beef was flavorful and tender, encased in a flaky pastry turnover.  I could have had two more of those!  The sauce accompanying was a cilantro pesto.  Oh my.  I asked Trey if the chef would give me the recipe for it because it was excellent.  It had a bit of a kick to it, but did not overpower.   For the entree, I chose the Chicken Mole.  I have never tried mole sauce before and it took me awhile to \"get it\".  It, too, was delicious.  The chicken breast was moist and fork tender.  With it, came beans and rice.  Finally, I chose the Tres Leches Cake for dessert.  Again, a new item for me.  I enjoyed it, especially the caramel topping.  For a drink, I chose the Black Currant Ice Tea - refreshing and tasty.  My bill came to $15.44, but I left $25.00.  This meal in a restaurant would have easily cost this and more.  Any tip you leave is forwarded to the scholarship fund of the Art Institute of LV.  I'm glad I made the reservation. I will be back."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try the Culinary School, but were disappointed with the food.  The dressing on the salad had so much vinegar it caused me to choke.  Do they taste what they are serving?  The main dish was a peppered steak with far too much pepper. The fries were either overcooked or undercooked. My creme brulee was perfect in the middle, but the top was actually burned.  I was disappointed and doubt I will return.  Maybe my expectations were too high."}
{"text":"The Skinny: Extremely good value for a pretty tasty three course menu with white linen tablecloths - for now this is a lunch only place (4) Service is super friendly (4).  Opus Too is the Art Institute's Culinary school restaurant. Yes, it's the training ground for the chefs of tomorrow. They are open 3 days a week for lunch only during the school year. They also require advance reservations.  The choices are eclectic (to introduce the students to different types of cuisine) so do check out their website before you go to see what they offer. They serve something very different every 1-2 weeks. The food is pretty good (3 stars-ish) and has an outstanding value ($10 for starter, entree, and dessert). Service, albeit untrained, is enthusiastic and pleasant.  If you have the time one day during the week to check this place out, do go. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Where is it? From the entrance, take the elevators or stairs to the 2nd floor. Make a right and a right. Or ask security guard if you get lost.   $10.95 lunch and dinner.   It's is a bang for your buck for $10.95 for a 3-course meal. I hope if you are deciding to come here you don't expect a stellar dinner where your taste buds go ecstatic. You must remember that students are making your dinner. They're not chefs just yet!  I went with my classmates on Valentine's Day/Birthday. It was fun as a group to critique the food and service. Overall, I think we were delighted with our servers. As for the food everything was standard and nothing to write home about. Note: this is not a first date spot! I just enjoyed the experience of supporting the students before they go out into the real world! Cool stuff!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times in the past 10 years and have yet to have a bad meal or even a mediocre meal here. I brought five other friends for lunch a few days ago... None of them had ever been here before.  The food was exceptionally good and everyone loved what they ordered. We definitely want to go back again and we will in the next couple of weeks before the menu changes.  These students do an incredible job on both food and service. The price-fixed menu has great choices; Three appetizers/salad, three entrées, two desserts - you pick one of each and there are some extra choices.  It's a hidden gem and you have to look for it at the end of the driveway alongside CLAIM JUMPER in Henderson. Strongly recommend this place for lunch but reservations are a must.  Ambience: quiet, white tablecloth, classy."}
{"text":"Opus Too is a student-run dining room at The International Culinary School at The Art Institute of Las Vegas. Everything served at Opus Too is prepared by senior level culinary arts students under the supervision of a professional chefs and dining room instructors. There is a nice view of the strip. I recommend making a reservation. I went in there after making reservations on open table but when I got there they didn't have me on the list.   The menu changes every week I believe. Three course meal for $11.95 during lunch. For starter, I had the frisée Aux Lardon which is a salad with fresh herbs, sherry vinaigrette and poached eggs. It was ok. For entrée I have Milk Braised pork belly- -lyonnaise potatoes with whole grain mustard and pork belly. I liked the sauce but it had too much fat and very less meat &  for desert, Croquembouche which is cream puffs coated with caramel and sugar.  The service was good and they made sure my drinks were filled."}
{"text":"Located in the Art Institute of Las Vegas (which is actually in Henderson), Opus Too is literally a hidden gem. Food is prepared and served by current culinary students, all of whom are rotating through various positions, both in the front and back of the house. The restaurant is open Tuesday-Thursday for both lunch (served from 11:30 AM-1PM [last seating at 12:30 PM]) and dinner (served 6-8 PM [last seating at 7 PM]) and all meals are three courses: a starter, an entree and a dessert for $11.95 before tax. Beer, wine, soft drinks and bottled water are available for purchase and market prices apply (our wine service was as much as our three course meal).  The menu is limited, but assuredly tasty and appears to change seasonally. The February 2015 selections offered three starter choices (Potato soup; chilled beet salad; BBQ shrimp), three entree selections (Poached cod with root vegetables; Opus burger and fries; Sage-dusted fried chicken served on a waffle) and two dessert options (mini ice cream sandwiches or dark chocolate cake). I had the chilled beet salad, as did my companion, the burger and the chocolate cake. The portions and presentation were in line with fine dining plates and the tastes were excellent. The staff even made my companion a special vegetarian dish, squash risotto, after I informed them during a pre-dinner phone call of my food dilemma. There were two options for red and white wine - we had red - and the chef/instructor was extremely engaged and personable. Our server Gabby was helped out by other students throughout the meal, and all were equally attentive. Although we did not inquire about a tour, other diners have noted that seeing the facilities is a possibility, so ask if you're inclined during your visit. On some evenings, a live pianist may accompany your dining. This didn't happen during our meal, but wholly appropriate Spanish guitar music set the mood just as well. Be forewarned that the restaurant has under 15 tables and the largest of these is a four top, so reservations, especially for a party larger than four, are a necessity. If you're looking for beautifully prepared, budget-friendly food in a unique environment, I wholeheartedly suggest checking out Opus Too when in or around Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great spot, nice place to take the family and you get good food at a beyond fair price. Plus  aspiring chefs and restaurateurs get to hone their skills"}
{"text":"Experience:  A friend made a reservation for us to try this place out. We had a very large group of 16 folks.  We met on a Thursday evening at 6:00pm.   Facility:  it's located upstairs at the Art Institute. It's a very small dinning room with maybe 10 tables. We took up most of the dinning room with our large group. It had a semi formal feel with the piano on the corner, the wait staff attire and the table settings. The kitchen is located behind a large glass window so you can watch the staff too.   Service:  The head chef was very friendly, welcome, and took the time to explain everything about the school and dinner. The wait staff/cooks varied. Some wee friendly and some were either nervous or just not friendly. The food was served at a good pace and the staff got you what you needed when you asked.   Food:  You get a prix fixe menu, but you have some small choices on it. You have a choice of one of three first courses, one of three second courses, and one of two desserts.  The menu changes daily, so no point in reviewing each dish. But the food overall was a tad bland. Everyone at our table agreed everything in the first course was under-seasoned and one lady even asked for salt, regardless of etiquette.  The second course had more flavor, but still a tad underwhelming.  The desserts were much better.   Overall: I'm glad I went. For the very low price...I think it was $12, you get a 3 course meal.  Basically, you get some unique upscale dishes in a formal atmosphere for casual prices. Not sure I will return anytime soon, as the food did not blow me away, but it was good and a great experience. Try it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a white table cloth affair that is run by the students of the culinary school under the supervision of a pair of professional chefs.  A 3-course, $10.95 lunch is served Tue-Thur while students are in session. We each started off with the arugula salad that included goat cheese barquettes and port wine poached pair. We were initially served the wrong entrees which were quickly replaced.  My wife's mushroom & roasted vegetable strudel with beets and a carrot ginger sauce was beautifully plated and delicious.  My baby clams and rapini over tagliatelle pasta was less successful because of the addition of chopped canned clams.    For dessert we each ordered cardamom rum cake with berry compote and crème fraiche.  The cake was not what we envisioned, but it was saved by the compote.  Given its modest price and the upscale atmosphere, this luncheon deal is hard to beat."}
{"text":"As soon as we sat down, the instructor explained to us, \"this is not a restaurant, this is a classroom.\"   I went tonight, the night after the opening, and my party of 4 was the only party there, so the entire \"class\" waited on us. The students are not experienced at all (this being their second night), but are very eager and attentive, and charmingly shy. You have to be patient when you come here, for example, we ordered a bottle of wine and the instructor had to show the students how to bring the wine to the table, cork it and pour it, and then he let the students try.   The food is very good, great for the price. 3 courses for $15?! and this ain't no Applebee's 3-course combo deal, I would say that it'd be fair to pay $35-$50 at a real restaurant."}
{"text":"I made a reservation on opentable after I had read something in passing about this place. I even got my 100 points for dining here... You are basically a practice setting for the students in the Culinary program at the Art Institute in Henderson.  This restaurant is a white table cloth affair that is run by the students of the culinary school under the supervision of the educators who are professional chefs.  A 3-course, $10.95 lunch is served Tue-Thur while students are in session. You experience the meal as if you are walking into a restaurant like say French Laundry.  We were sat by the window looking into the kitchen. It was exciting to see all the action and the effort that goes into making it operate. What was more thrilling for us was the fact that the two of us coming from the restaurant industry were able to experience first hand what goes into making a Michelin starred chef and front of house team. It is all very well executed and the food was absolutely delicious.   The three courses (appetizer, entree, & dessert) are in the style of plating of a fine dining restaurant (the places that break your wallet and have you craving for a burger right after) and you are able to order a glass of wine or beverage (extra charge) with your meal. But the price is truly a tenth of what you would pay normally for such an grand experience. At the end of the meal you are encourage to complete a comment card for feedback.  The topping was to see the great pleasure these students take in learning their art. More restaurants should send their staff to a class like this, we would have less attitude, better service and more passion for the industry.  Thank you Class of 2013 - I look forward to dining in your own restaurants one day."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of being the guinea pigs for future chefs. I loved my experience at the other two culinary classes. AI, impressed me with their extensive menu of six items for appetizers and entrees. Desserts were limited to four, but that is still going above and beyond for a learning environment.   Opus Too is only available through reservations, but it is made simple through Yelp/Open Table. I set up a lunch for my friend and I for 12:15. We got there early, checked in, and were sat immediately.   The students upfront all looked nervous and awkward in having to go live. Overall, I was not sure if they were more nervous about having to tend to real guest or doing this for a grade. Shaky on certain service fundamentals, the staff were still friendly.   I really wished we had the table in front of the large window. With a great view into the kitchen, I would have not been so focused on how ill timed the courses were. Bread and water was served immediately. Appetizers took some time to come out. I got the Roasted Butternut Squash and Apple Salad. The dressing is drizzled along the outside of the plate while the greens were plain. It was light and I appreciated the dressing on the side. My friend enjoyed her salmon dish as well. When we were finished, the wait for the entrees was even longer. A few of the staff came to apologize for the delay and went to check on it. I had ordered the Braised Beef. The sauce was wonderful, but the meat was dry. Almost to a jerky consistency. The Veal was good. We had finished with the Chocolate cake with Fig Sorbet and Banana Rhum Bread Pudding. Both were solid dishes and our favorites.   I had attended a few events thrown by the UNLV Hospitality Department and they offered comment cards. For a student, feedback would be beneficial. I wished there was a way to offer this without having to put the students on the spot. Allow them a chance to reflect on the day and make adjustments for the next would help them improve.   For $10.95, it is an unbeatable deal. I want to go back and try a few other dishes."}
{"text":"Okay. I loved this place. The menu changes daily and you need reservations. The food was first class and cheap. The negatives weren't really negatives since this is basically a class. The waitress didn't mention the wine menu or ask if I wanted any, but she was obviously a little nervous. The dining room is small and there is a large window looking into the kitchen so you can watch the main chef instruct and observe and inspect the chefs-in-training. It was a lot of fun. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the nicest experience here.  The servers were so hospitable and professional and the food was outstanding.  These students were remarkable!"}
