{"text":"Horrible service! There were bugs crawling in the walls and floors. In the bathroom there is NO sink and all the moldy pipes are showing. My hookah wasn't working right and I tried to tell the lady working but she just said its fine without even coming to look. $50 to sit in the vip area is outrageous! They don't even have any nice couches in there. They are all tore up and nasty. Worst hookah lounge I've even been to."}
{"text":"The owner is super nice. The hookah are fantastic. Its obvious where the money is spent - on the hookahs and shisha. The place is really shady looking from the outside and it's hard to find...but I'll definitely be back. The decor is a bit hard on the eyes but I'm ok with that since the quality is there for the hookah. I want to support the small business here. I don't feel unwelcome and there's good seating. We're here on a friday at 930 and there's business here but it's not crowded. Hookahs with a fresh disposable hose are 11 dollars and refill heads are 5 dollars. Very reasonable.  I took a star off for the ambience but the quality is great. I got blue mist and it tastes great- no coal taste. The owner knows his craft and they use khalil maroon hookahs. They have starbuzz and al fahkir shisha."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, pretty chill, great prices. Bathrooms kinda dirty doh. Ehhh definitely suitable for a small group but the crew can roll up as way."}
{"text":"Super sketchy went on a weekend and it seemed like a  well ..dirty place.  Nothing stood out to make me want to go here again."}
