{"text":"I'll be the first to say, Azuma isn't the place to go if you're looking for any kind of advancement in avant-guard sushi with your foie gras and nitro sauces with rice paper wrapper served on a flip-flop cos it'd be ironic. The chef has been doing this for the past 30 years and this is the place you want to go to for good, traditional sushi. Azuma is a family run business with mom in the kitchen and the daughter up front. Like a five year old telling you that you're ugly, this sushi is about as honest as it gets. Please note that there was no fruit mentioned in any of the maki rolls the chef picked for us... take that as a GOOD thing."}
{"text":"The black cod was incredible.  The sushi was unremarkable. The service was *unbelievably* slow (and we were pretty much the only ones in there for the first hour and a half of our time there...). It's possible that we ordered the wrong things, and should've stuck more to the hot dishes (we ordered mostly sushi, but based on the other reviews here and the incredible black cod dish, I think we probably should've gone with more non-sushi dishes)."}
{"text":"Sushi was very good. Authentic, good location. My fiancée doesn't normally enjoy tuna sashimi, but she devoured theirs and is still talking about it.

If it's a hot day, sit near the bar to get some A/C, as the further from the bar area you get the hotter the room is when busy."}
{"text":"Sushi here is very good. Fresh and delectable.

This is not a run-of-the-mill Sushi joing where warm sushi rolls out from a machine.
Apparently this place has seen the times and they do things here the old style.
Love it for the authenticity
 
I liked the Gyoza too! 'twas just perfect with some warm sake on the side

Decor is warm and service quick and friendly. 
I'm surprised this place has so little reviews. Must visit."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with my dinner here. Maybe I'm too hipster with my sushi, but I like my sushi to be a little more creative than the plain Jane items I always find at all sushi restaurants. But to be fair, the fish we had tasted fresh and I think there were some items on my plate that I've never seen before. So that's good :)

But the red wine they serve is just not okay. It tastes as if it had been open already for a few days, at least. Now, you might be wondering why I order red wine at a Japanese restaurant? Well, it's cause I live in Quebec and I like wine with all my meals. If the restaurant is going to serve red wine, it should at least provide an acceptable option. Otherwise, don't bother!

Will not come back. Just not for me. Might be for you if you don't drink red wine and like simple and fresh sushi. Also, the waitress was very nice! Service kind of slow but very pleasant."}
{"text":"Updating my review to 5 stars as the sushi is continually just excellent and unmatched in the area."}
{"text":"This is a gem. Traditional Japanese food prepared with great care and attention to detail. The vegetable tempura was perfect, and at $5.75 a steal. In fact the prices here, given the quality, are very good. 

Yes service is sometimes a bit slow but I think this is because they prepare everything when you order it.

One of the best and most authentic Japanese restaurants in Montreal.

(NB: they no longer serve sushi.)"}
{"text":"One of the few authentic Japanese restaurants in Montreal. No \"fusion\" or fruit in your sushi, no deep fried, cream cheese filled bullshit. This is the real deal and actually owned by an adoreable Japanese family. I am so grateful they are close to my work."}
{"text":"Picked this place based on the yelp reviews and was very happy.  First thing is first, you must, and I mean must, order the grilled Mackerel.  This was one of the most perfect examples of this dish I've had.  Even ones I had in Japan weren't this good.  It is a super simple thing, but some real skill to do it right.  We also had the Hamachi Kama, which was excellent as well.  A large one at that!  Very succulent and yummy.  We finished things off with the grilled eel.  Again very good, but in this case I have had better.  But still an excellent example of this dish.  

A good selection of saki at decent prices is another plus.  And excellent service.  I would so become a regular if this was down the street from me.  The only bummer is the day we were there they didn't have any sushi as the sushi chef was out a reception or something.  Which made me sad but give me a reason to come back to Montreal soon and try this place again.

Remember, Grilled Mackerel!"}
{"text":"Correct, mais sans plus! J'ai été plutôt déçu par mon plat de riz et crevettes tempura, c'était très fade. Mon compagnon de souper a pris le poisson du jour, qui ne venait sans rien d'autre (un poisson entier grillé, tout nu dans l'assiette). Ambiance un peu démodée, service correct. Au moins c'est pas cher, et il y a un très bon choix de plats typiques japonais! Il y a aussi une petite sélection de sushis, que je n'ai pas eu la chance d'essayer."}
{"text":"Azuma is a great place, but easy to miss as it doesn't look like much from outside. The food is amazing though and the prices are very good. It's a quiet place, without much of an ambiance but it really doesn't need much more. There is a semi-private room for bigger groups too. The menu is pretty large and I would recommend any seafood dish as they are generally great!"}
{"text":"Real authentic Japanese owned gem. Great service, great food, the shirashi we had was fresh there were at least 8-9 different items, generous with tasty pickles, sweet egg and good rice. I also liked the broth that came with it was very subtlety salted. We also had an extra green bean on the house which was thoughtful from the chef. Also the soft shell crab was very tasty will be back very soon to taste the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great lunch special, bento box, sushi and tempura."}
