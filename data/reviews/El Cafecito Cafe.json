{"text":"This is the best coffee shop in the neighborhood. I think that because of its location on a sidestreet just off Bloor many people have yet to discover it. It's spacious, cozy and inviting and the coffee is great. Bonus points for the many free newpapers, books and magazines available for patrons."}
{"text":"This is my first time at El Cafecito, and I will definitely be returning. Here is why:  1) Good seats and tables. At most other cafes the chairs and/or tables are wobbly. It makes it hard to be productive when you're going to a cafe to work. The chair and table I am sitting at are solid enough I would be happy if I had them at home.  2) Fast wifi  3) Location: being on side street just off of bloor makes it a little quieter. Not as good if you want to people watch, but definitely a plus if you want to focus.  A note on the lighting: they have soft lighting that is more conducive to being on a date than doing work. It's not bothering me, but if you like to be in a brightly lit environment when it's dark out then just be aware of that.  I don't really know enough about coffee to a judge a place on the quality of its coffee. It wasn't the best cappuccino I've ever had, but it was perfectly fine, the staff were nice, and for me the environment is what matters most."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this hidden gem in bloorcourt  village a couple of weeks ago. Spacious, high ceilings, large windows, wifi, massive patio for the summer time, great coffee, a handful of little snacks to nibble on (slightly pricey for what they are, but drinks and coffee are really reasonable), and a very low key laid back and warm vibe. It's a perfect place to study, work, read, catch up with friends, or grab an after work or lunch time glass of wine (I've done all those things just today....having taken up residence here for 5 hours). It has tons of potential, and I'm so surprised at how quiet it is during the week days and evenings! Perfect place for a music show, poetry reading, special events etc (apparently they do those sometimes too)....and they have a massive empty wall that could easily showcase a rotation of community artists. Saunter on by. ...."}
{"text":"It's a great cafe just off Bloor St.! It's quite airy and spacious, with lots of natural light. There is a couch, some barstools by a window ledge and about seven tables (fairly generously spaced out; not all squished together as in some square-footage-challenged Toronto cafes). There are interesting pieces of antique furniture here and some neat artwork!   The free wi-fi was quite stable while I was here. Very tasteful music (some jazz... Latin American, I think?) at just the right volume. The moment I walked in, I knew I wanted to hang out here. It was relaxed, quiet, and unpretentious without being a dive.  To drink, I had a latte and a capp, both of which were quite decent -- pretty strong, with a hint of bitterness. I also had a couple of very yummy empanadas (they have four varieties, two of which are vegetarian), and a tiny and lovely gluten-free shortbread cookie.  The washrooms in the basement were clean and in good shape -- far better than the downright scary spaces I've encountered in some coffee joints.  Verdict: a great place all-around. Even though I don't live in the neighbourhood, I'll no doubt be back."}
{"text":"Owner was friendly, the place was cozy and welcoming.  Lovely place!"}
{"text":"Charming little place, great espresso! Didn't get a chance to try any snacks but I loved the Spanish music and great decor. Gets lots of natural light which is nice."}
{"text":"One of my favourite coffee shops in the city.  I'm grateful to have it in the neighborhood.  Quiet, bright, great lattes and empanadas."}
{"text":"Stop #4 on my indie coffee passport! I would never have known this place existed if it weren't for the passport, and I'm so so glad I found it! Beautiful place, great location. Super central, but enough off the busyness of bloor that it feels like a private caffeinated hideaway. Lots of space and seating, lovely decor, loads of natural light, magazines and books around for reading - exchange the book you just finished for another one at the leave a book, take a book table. Amazing coffee, no charge for soy milk, and the guy who was working there was super friendly and helpful. I had a soy latte with vanilla extract added - it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This was a sweet discovery made through the Indie passport.  Although I had to visit three times before I finally caught it open - this place closes early! - the very tasty coffee made my efforts worthwhile.  The coffee shop feels embedded in the neighbourhood, tucked away, inconspicuous.  There is such a peaceful vibe:  airy, with bleached hardwood floors, classical music playing softly in the background, people busy on their laptops, speaking in low tones.  Actually, it feels more like a library than a coffee shop, and I would consider coming here to get work done."}
{"text":"Terrific coffee in a lovely space.   Quiet, bright space just off Bloor. Wonderful coffee. Have a latte. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh, my absolute favourite coffee shop in Toronto.  I've been countless times, and it's just the most pleasant space--the music always good and at a volume where you can hear it without feeling that it's invasive. The coffee is delicious (the lattes!), and so are the empanadas.   I also love that Cafecito hasn't crowded the space with as many tables as humanly possible--I'm sure you're familiar with this uncomfortable thing in many other coffee shops in Toronto. There's enough room to actually move in Cafecito, and that makes it such a nice place to work or hang out. There's a lot of natural light, and a very low-key vibe."}
{"text":"Nice cafe!  great location.  lots of space,  lovely decor, and good coffee!"}
{"text":"Bloordale's clean little secret!  I wonder how many times I walked by Westmoreland Ave. thinking \"Damn! I wish there was a place to get a $%^&&! cup of coffee around here!\"  Cleverly hidden by the unsightly flower shop extension of small grocer # 2438 on Bloor, Cafecito has been up and running for some time now.  Really good coffee, yummy empanadas, a bright and airy space with an old world feel, and a very friendly owner are a winning combo and a very welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best in Toronto. Unfortunately, it seems to be under construction or maybe even closed. Check before coming."}
{"text":"Part of Indie coffee passport (ICP) in 2011 this spot didn't impress much last year.  In addition they didn't have the cappuccino (I have a penchant for Cappuccinos )  on the drinks one can order on the Indie Coffee passport for 2012. I was given the following options that are eligible for ICP Drip Coffee (Hot) Espresso (Single or Double) Espresso Macchiato (Single or Double) Americano (Single or Double; Hot) Cortado (Single or Double) Caffe Latte/Cafe Con Leche (Single or Double) I went for the Double Cortado The barista took her time in preparing this drink which is highly appreciated. Finish was with some latte art   Espresso: Bold Crema': Thick and Velevty  Latte Art: Cortado is not really a drink to show off latte art but there was nice design in place Milk: N/A such a negligible amount that one can't judge it fairly I tried it without the sweetener first and it was decent drink after adding the sweetener it became just right for me and provided the caffeine jolt I needed on a gloomy day like today. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great atmosphere, great service.  If you have a coffee passport (even if you don't), go check out El Cafecito right now!"}
{"text":"Second time I was here and it was much better. There were a few more people with laptops. The man working here seemed friendlier and there was live music by the Latin Jazz Artist Mario Munoz.   Latte was still okay and overall the place seemed to be a little more alive. Albeit still very low-key and quiet -which is a good thing for this place, than if you were at a busy Starbucks.  All in all, it is slowly growing on me. Mario plays on Saturdays so if I do go, it will probably be then."}
{"text":"Popped in for a cold latte... every table was taken with people and laptops... and air conditioning... great latin blues playing in the background... good to see people in there.  The cafe is hidden by the corner stores flower market but there is a a sandwich board outside and new tables and chairs are put out every morning."}
{"text":"This cafe is such a secret I first noticed it on Yelp and not at all when walking, biking or driving by. I live in the area and it took me 6 months to take notice and give it a try. That's can be good or bad depending on how you view it.   El Cafecito is in a pretty spot. It's a stone's throw from Bloor, yet so quiet and serene. The building catches the afternoon sun and it warms it up nicely.  It is full of people working and I'll admit that I'm one of those people every now and then. The drinks are very basic, anything espresso based can be made with soy milk and a small selection of tea and baked goods.  The owner is friendly and the atmosphere is laid-back.  I'd like to throw in a correction in this review. A few other reviews have mentioned Bloordale in their review, the neighbourhood that is west of Dufferin. This cafe is in Bloorcourt, the neighbourhood bordering Bloor and Dovercourt. Yelp doesn't seem to recognize this 'hood though and just calls it 'Dovercourt'."}
{"text":"Fairly decent coffee with empanadas. The atmosphere is nice They have many hand made Mexican goods for sale."}
{"text":"Great espresso and latte and brewed coffee.    The owner, John, Is a friendly guy who remembers your preferences quickly and with a smile.    Although it is steady, it is never too busy or cramped.   The have a great west facing patio which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"I bet you didn't know of a cool little cafe spot in Bloordale, did you?  Well, I discovered it a while ago thanks to my friend Julia, who is a loyal patron, and we've decided that it's time to let the secret out.   Open for a few months, El Cafecito is a charming place that's located a few steps of Bloor Street. The space feels airy and open with a few tables and chairs, or on the church pew placed along one of the walls. If you prefer to sit outside to soak up the sun, you can do that too. It's a low-key, relaxed space that invites those who want to read their book or work.  I'm always on the lookout for a good Americano and the owner John makes a great one. He also sells a few treats if you're feeling hungry.   So far, I've been here for events that a few friends have organized. One of them was a clothing swap and the other was jewelry making. El Cafecito is the type of the place where these low-key events can happen and everyone is welcome to participate.   Another great thing about El Cafecito: free wi-fi!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I was at El Cafecito, I wasn't all too impressed. I remembered a number of dead wasps or flies on the windowsill beside me. Ever since then, I dreaded going back. It was not pleasant being in a cafe that wasn't so clean (chilling with the wasps, does that sound like a good cafe experience to you?).  But second time was the charm when I came in, impressed with how full the cafe was. The previous year I went, there were a lot fewer customers. However, despite being full, the cafe was quiet as people worked away or kept their nose behind the newspaper. And no more bugs on the windowsill! Yayy!  To get in touch with its Latin American roots, El Cafecito offers dancing lessons after the cafe closes down and changes the place into a dance floor. They have tango every Wednesday and salsa every Thursday between 7 PM to 10/11 PM. So if you are looking for something new to try, why not with some fun dance lessons to bring out your inner dancing queen/king? With some coffee on the side of course.  Overall, I think this is a sweet place for people who would like to study or work in peace but still be surrounded by people (does that make sense?). It's one of the reasons why I whole-heartedly love cafes: in order to work with an environment full of people. Despite it being full, for this trip and the one I did after, it was as quiet as the library, except for the light instrumental music in the background."}
{"text":"Nice, quiet place. Immaculately clean. Surprisingly spacious interior with good set up for people who want to get some work done. (Nice tables with plenty of room for laptops). Kitschy decor with coffee bean bags and soft coloured walls/floor.  Friendly older gentlemen working here. (YAY, no douchy hipster snob serving me coffee - a refreshing change).  I'm a plain jane when it comes to coffee - I just like my regular brew. The brewed coffee here was reasonably priced ($1.30-$1.90). It was nice not being ripped off for once. Brewed coffee was self serve."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great ambiance, great service.  If you have a coffee but check out El Cafecito right now!"}
{"text":"Such amazing coffee and espresso. Amazing cafe to check out, honestly. They serve both coffee type drinks and alcohol. Def. will be back since this place isn't overpacked and plays great latin music. I had a badass orange almond biscotti with my espresso! Woohoo!"}
