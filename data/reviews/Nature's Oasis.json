{"text":"Awesome new spot in Lakewood with great coffee and speciality items. The staff is very friendly and even ask customers what their favorite items are so they can order them. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Nature's Oasis today and really loved it.  There were 4 of us.  We ordered the berry, basil, goat cheese panini sandwich, the BLT, and the Veggie melt.  Every one of them was good.  We also ordered and enjoyed the Very Veggie Salad (we chose the balsamic vinaigrette dressing) and the Very Berry Salad (we chose the mandarin ginger dressing).  We also enjoyed a smoothie there.  You order at the counter and pick it up at a counter.  The eating space is shared in one corner by healthy, adventurous foods for sale.  Although we are visitors to the Cleveland area, I really look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Much more so than other coffee places in lakewood. Best coffee around. Good smoothies and the BLT is great and cheap."}
{"text":"Think local coffee shop meets local health food store.  Lots of Vegan/Gluten Free options in the market and cafe.  Delicious Rising Star & Heartwood Coffee Beverages and a Build your own smoothie with fresh fruit.  This store supports other local small businesses in their store with all Ohio beer and Wine selection.  Plenty of room to get cozy and enjoy a meal while studying.  Great addition to Lakewood."}
{"text":"All natural, local/Ohio products & ingredients, super fresh, healthy, vegan options, gluten free options, and make your own smoothie/toast/bagel options. Great place to grab a coffee (Heartwood & Rising Star), meal, grocery essentials, unique products, and even gift shopping all in one trip. Has a lot to offer including a large sit down cafe area, live music on weekends, and product samplings/events from time to time. Really convenient location and excellent addition to central Lakewood area!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Workers are so friendly and they have a great menu for vegan/gluten free! Awesome cute little spot for some coffee or smoothies with friends or a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start: Incan teas, baklava mead, vegan sriracha jerky, sea salt chocolate chunk cookies. This place will make you happy. Bring a friend and stay a while."}
{"text":"Love Lakewood even more ever since this place opened!! Delicious food with good vegan options and excellent service. I feel so at home here and love the concept of a cafe combined with a partial grocery store that includes local products. Such a good atmosphere and you are greeted with a smile right when you walk in, I always feel taken care of and also there's the fact that this place is just so cute!!! Along of great prices and even better food, this place is definitely a new favorite and will be seeing a lot of me."}
{"text":"I just love this place!  The staff is excellent! The food, tea selection, and music on point. And if you need to grab some random odds and ends the grocery area is just what you need.   Highly recommend you give this place a go=]"}
{"text":"Nature's Oasis has stolen my heart.   Their staff is friendly, their food is awesome and their prices certainly can't be beaten.  Thankful to have a healthy AND affordable grab and go-style (though you can dine in) joint in my neighborhood. You can build your own smoothie and it isn't loaded with the stuff you don't want (like sherbert and other unnecessary processed junk), but I love their Mocha Banana Wake Up Call smoothie.   Their wraps are filling and delicious, and they feature rotating specials that are equally as delish."}
{"text":"I've been feeling mentally drained today so I decided to check out Nature's Oasis for the first time since they are an option on UberEATS. Not only did they exceed my expectations, but they left a lovely message on my cup that made my day. Thank you so much to the Nature's Oasis team. You really turned my day around and I can't thank you enough. It's the little things in life."}
{"text":"Okay, so I walked into this place with very high hopes as it seems to have great reviews. I went up to the counter to order a coffee and was greeted by a very rude young woman. I shook it off and placed my order, all while receiving dirty looks the entire time. While it was already a horrible experience, it only got worse.... after she took my order and walked away, I heard her talking with her other female coworker and they were both making very very nasty comments about me and \"men\" in general. After hearing that, I just walked out; I didn't even want to get my coffee. If you like your coffee with a side of sexism, then this place is for you! If not, then you're not missing out; it's just another wannabe, hipster coffee shop among million others. I'd stay clear from here if I were you."}
{"text":"This little spot caught my attention just as I turned the corner from where I live. Nature's Oasis is a true, local establishment that offers great options for everyone. I tried the Buckeye Latte, an extremely unique, but absolutely delicious flavor. I then decided to spend a few hours here while I worked from home one morning. The staff was very professional with all their customers, and worked diligently to get orders completed with quality and haste. This place has a special vibe, and I hope to see it grow."}
{"text":"Great Little Gem Nicely presented, healthy food with a variety of fresh ingredients. Live music that wasn't overbearing. Polite staff and great value for the food. Nice decor with a small natural grocery store on one side. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last week and will 100% be back! The food tastes fresh and delicious. My friend recommended Nature's Oasis to me and I guarantee I will be recommending it to other friends as a great fast casual alternative to unhealthy, terrible for you fast food."}
{"text":"I really dig this place. It was a clean little store with a little bit of everything in it. The workers were pretty cool and helpful. They have vegan options that are yummy and tasty. Hubby ordered Mocha Banana Wake Up Call Smoothie and had banana chocolate bread that was so moist and delicious. Yummy I will def be returning here."}
{"text":"I usually get a coffee and the avocado toast , which is always amazing with multigrain bread. Comes out fresh and the employees are always kind and respectful. Perfect place to study, casual friend dare, or even just to grab lunch."}
{"text":"What a cool addition in Lakewood. I came here one morning to get a smoothie and avocado toast and lo and behold it's also a store! It was nice to be able to shop around while waiting for my order to be ready. There is minimal seating if you want to enjoy your food or drinks in house. This place is vegan and healthy friendly. They use Breadsmith bread for the avocado toast and only charge $5 for two thick slices and they also add tomato. They have a decent sized menu for such a small place. I will definitely be stopping by again to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"This spot was such a good find in Lakewood! The food was so fresh and wonderful, I got the carrot hot dog and vegan coleslaw! It was full of flavor and it didn't taste overly \"healthy.\" The coleslaw was much better than any non vegan coleslaw I've ever had. The smoothies and coffees are great too, not too expensive.   I also would recommend spending some time in the grocery area. There are great organic options and lots of variety. I stocked up on healthy protein bars, quick oats and fruit. The perfect items for a college student. ALSO, I had the best honey crisp apple I've ever had from there.   Natures Oasis is a perfect spot to hang out and eat healthy foods! When I visited there was even a live musician. Spend some time there, study, eat and shop! You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Delightful - good for vegetarians and vegans. They also have a cute grocery area that has cat grass! Buy some to take home to your cat"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The ambience is quaint, warm, and very welcoming. The people are extremely kind.  Try the Carmel Comet, it is delicious!!"}
{"text":"The staff is great, very friendly!  We go in as a family regularly for coffee and smoothies.  You can create your own smoothie or get ones off the menu board. As for the food, We also love the BLT and PB and J 2.0.   This is a great place to find any local product you may be looking for. Such a great selection of Ohio sourced products!"}
{"text":"Our new go to for quick, healthy options. Great coffee and great selection of bites. After our first time, we came back three other times that week. We now probably come here at least once a week! Ha! Try the waffles for a treat. Love the atmosphere too and it's fun to browse the market while waiting for your order! They often have someone playing acoustic guitar on the weekends and they're always really good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today, glad I did. I had been hearing rave reviews of the roasted carrot hotdog. It was so good I will definitely be going back. I added the slaw which made it even better. The atmosphere is great and so is the staff."}
{"text":"Found this cute spot while visiting from California! We came here almost every day to get their delicious coffee and breakfast.  The waffle is the best I've ever had- topped with fresh fruit and coconut whipped cream...YUM. you would never guess that it's vegan AND gluten free. They also have a wonderful variety of organic products!"}
{"text":"A safe haven for vegans. The waffles were super good! Highly recommend the coconut whip cream and berries on top. Great place to stock up on goodies for a road trip as well.    P.S. Try some of their bomb mead!    ;)"}
{"text":"We stopped in while walking around Downtown Lakewood tonight and Nature's Oasis was such a great find. I've driven passed it lord knows how many times and now I wish I had stopped in sooner.   They had a great variety of kombucha, the coffee was affordable and tasty, and we will be going back to check out the food because it looked great.   In addition to the coffee and cafe side, they have a great little store area with health food for a great price. I'll probably be back to pick up some groceries next time I'm in the area. I totally recommend."}
{"text":"Nature's Oasis is a great addition to Lakewood's local business scene! The staff is kind and inviting. Stop in for a cappuccino and a pizza bagel!"}
{"text":"I've been working in the Lakewood area for almost 2 years and I'm so sad I just tried this gem! I was very pleasantly surprised by the amount of food I got and the prices were great. I typically go to whole foods and make a salad for lunch and end up paying so much more than the price of my salad I got that was almost double the size. It was super fresh and fill of flavor. I'll be a new regular!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly, laid-back atmosphere. Great coffee and a good menu that has something for everyone. Everything I've tried from here has been wholesome and tasty- especially the waffles and avocado toast."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. So close to home and easy walking distance for many residents. Great concept and idea. Coffee shop, with snacks and quick grab items as well as a cafe for food.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm always telling my friends to go to Nature's Oasis! Such a quirky and friendly staff, and clean aesthetic/environment - I haven't even mentioned the food yet! The coffee is top notch, and I probably get a smoothie from here at minimum twice a week, but a lot of times more! The pizza bagel has a soft spot in my heart too! Nature's Oasis was a great addition to Lakewood. If you haven't been yet then you're missing out!"}
{"text":"They have a wonderful grocery section with lots of vegan items.  Their cooler at the register often has Nature's Bins prepared foods, so if you are looking for some of your favorites since they'd closed, Nature's Oasis may have it.  Definitely love finding the Nature's Bin peanut butter and chocolate slice there.  The employees are friendly and patient, but they kick into fast gear when prepping food and there is often not a long wait for your lunch to be made.  The hours are nice as well.  They are open early in the morning for stopping on the way to work and in the evening to stop on your way home."}
{"text":"I love this place! I went here with a friend and we both got black coffee, the energy toast, and my friend got a granola parfait as well. It was so affordable for the amazing quality! I am, admittedly, a coffee snob and their coffee is fantastic. I also appreciated all of the gluten free and vegan items on the menu. I will definitely be back and am excited to look around in the little market area next time."}
{"text":"This place is great. Decent vegan groceries that aren't from whole foods. The staff is kind and knowledgeable, especially celia. I only wish there was a bigger grocery space for more vegan goods!"}
{"text":"Yay! Another great small business for Lakewood.  I know this is much more than a coffee shop but they have fab java and I'm soooo lovin' their cold brew coffee.  They also have Cleveland Bagel goodies and smoothies.  We've needed a spot just like this that we can take a walk and hang out with a drink or pick up something on the way to work. I think I'll stop in the morning as a matter of fact. Yum!  Super cute space and nice people behind the counter.  http://www.naturesoasisstores.com"}
{"text":"O. M. G. If you're vegan (or health conscious in general), this is such a great spot. I just left there... went in to buy almond butter and left with $70 worth of stuff... because they have so many items I can't find anywhere, even places like Whole Foods and Earthfare! They stock Poison Berry vegan bakery items, Nature's Bin vegan deli items (macaroni salad, potato salad, desserts, etc.). But... the icing on the cake... Herbivorous Butcher vegan meats and cheeses. I had to pinch myself because I was so excited! Oh, and they have the Daiya individual cheese packs (like the ones from the mac and cheese)! I know their items change often (which I love), but I wanted to point out how many hard-to-find items they have, because no matter when you go, they'll have something you'll enjoy. Oh, and their coffee is amazing. Off to eat this sandwich... :)"}
{"text":"I hope this place survives in Lakewood (it's a little pricey) but I absolutely love this place they have everything form a little market with local items to drip coffee, smoothies, juices and bites to eat. Stopped in once around when they opened and everyone was just so friendly and nice I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Love love love it!! So happy this is so close to home :) so far I have tried the vegan waffle SOOO GOOD and the pizza bagels..  love that I can grab healthy groceries here also!"}
{"text":"I went to Natures Oasis for the first time this morning. I ordered a waffle with peanut butter and almonds. I was super excited to try it, as I've followed you guys on IG for awhile. I circled the store a few times, played my HP video game until I was out of energy, played all my lives on another game, and my waffle still wasn't ready. I got it after 15 minutes, which I thought was kinda long for 1 waffle. But it was still hot when I got home so I was pleased enough. I loved the texture, the almost \"gooey\" inside with the crunch on the outside is so amazing. But the flavor of the actual waffle wasn't anything to write home about. The peanut butter nor almonds really did anything to help it out flavor wise. For $5, I'd try it again maybe. An unbeatable value for the price, and the aesthetic is beautiful! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I just went to Nature's Oasis for the first time and I'm in LOVE. I got avocado toast on sourdough and a smoothie and they are so fresh and good. They didn't skimp on avocado at all, which is impressive for a $4.99 price tag. There were several other menu items i wanted to try, so I'll be back. I highly recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches. I love the veggie melt and my mouth waters thinking about the soup. Also, i get the smoothies before workouts and never have i been disappointed. This place has great vibes, amazing food and live music!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Staff is welcoming and the food is fresh af. I loved that most of the items are locally made. Excited to have a new lunch and coffee spot!"}
{"text":"Well i will try and go easy since cashier was sweetest gal...So ive been excited to try here. Came in an hour from closing time and they were down to a few unappealling drops left of decaf but offered a pour over. I opted for regular- (;pastrys too!..delicious) Guy after me had to also wait for what he wanted 10 minutes. Just seemed to be trying to close. I noticed very quiet except for conversation nearby; waitress said music app wasnt working.!! Air felt kind of stuffy so i left and not sure i ll be back..Great food; fix atmosphere. Thats very imp. too!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty obsessed with this place. There's nothing like a new, independent coffee shop opening up. Add food to the mix, and I'm sold.  Atmosphere: open and spacious. I love the color choices, green is my favorite, and against the wood it gives the place a nice, earthy feel. My only complaint is that I'm freezing after about an hour of being there. I wish they would crank the heat a little.   Service: super friendly staff, very welcoming and kind.  Food/drinks: I'm more of an iced tea drinker than coffee. I find their iced teas...unusual. I've switched over to juices, but that's just my taste buds. They are definitely interesting. I love their simple menu. I'm so thankful they offer gluten free bread! I recommend the grilled cheese with berries, and their soup of the day never disappoints. I'm excited to try their roasted carrot \"hot dog\" substitute.   There is also an entire section of grocery full of natural, organic products. Definitely worth a visit..or a hundred visits, if you're me."}
{"text":"Amazing. Such a nice little place! They are vegan friendly with an amazing menu. Try the southwestern \"chik'n\" wrap (veganized)! It is so tasty! They also have a lot of local bread, beer, produce, and some frozen options, too."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and able to answer all questions! Such a variety in the food and drinks they offer! They literally cater to every type of diet!! Even gluten free bagels! Where else do you find gluten free bagels in a cafe type setting???? No where, except for this cool place! Your number one place to stop and shop/eat!!! The chicken pesto sandwich was pretty damn good! The fruit tasted sweet and fresh!! Can't wait to update this review with more, once I eat more food from here"}
{"text":"I finally visited Nature's Oasis and this will not be my last time. This is a grocery store as well as a cafe that sells organic products.   I stopped in to get a bite to eat for dinner. I bought a bowl of small lentils (cooked vegan) and OH MY WORD. The lentils were so delicious that I wish I had rice to go along with it. If you love beans and if you are trying to have a more plant based diet then I would recommend the lentils. There was such a good blend of flavours in the lentils. I'm curious as to what spices, if any, were used in preparing the lentils.   The cafe also has breakfast and lunch options. I got a green goodness smoothie which has banana, spinach, yogurt (it is a coconut yogurt), peanut butter, and skim milk (I choose Almond milk instead). For the smoothies, you can actually also make your own smoothie with whatever ingredients you want. Also, for the smoothies on their menu, you can always modify it if you want to remove or add something.  There are some tables and chairs inside so you can eat your food there and also stay a while to read, study, etc.   I highly recommend Nature Oasis and I can't wait to come back soon.   *** This is my 101 Yelp review overall.  55 reviews for 2018. I am aiming for 60 reviews in 2018 but I think I can get 100 reviews."}
{"text":"The avocado toast here is great! So many vegan options, which is awesome. The market here is also neat. A very cool place!"}
{"text":"Excellent chill spot in Lakewood with great wholesome food and coffee compliments of local roasters. Highly recommended for a quick, healthy bite or meeting up with friends in the afternoon. They also have a small market with local food ingredients for shopping while waiting for your order. Love it here!"}
{"text":"I just tried this place, ordering a BLT on gluten-free bread. It was great! I will definitely go back for another sammich and to pick up some unusual grocery items. Great find!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's right down the street for my house and its my go to for coffee in the morning. The smoothies here are great especially the oasis. I love that they have flavored water to try during the day as well. You have to try the mint feta couscous salad if they have it. I'm completely addicted to eat so much that even eat it for breakfast. I've never had a bad experience here and the employees are so nice and upbeat. This would be a great place to hang out with friends and catch up or get some work done with a healthy breakfast and a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I watched the barista pour two cups of tap water into the blender to make my \"aloha smoothie\"-which ended up tasting like water with some light hints of banana and pineapple in it. Felt totally ripped off."}
{"text":"A great option for healthy food in a quick grab and go or dine in concept. Took my dear mama there for an after Mother's Day meal to let her know she is appreciated. The fruit infused courtesy water is a nice touch. Coffee is good. Smoothies are better. The mandarin ginger salad dressing blew my mom's mind. They serve breakfast all day and have Bialys bagels! The best bagels in Cleveland! They have a lot of small bites of food for sale with an emphasis on locally grown health foods. Vegan options aplenty as well. I will be coming back many times for healthy and affordable meals. The staff was very kind and helpful."}
{"text":"A cafe and coffee shop within a very small health market! A quiet space with pleasant music. Great for working and studying."}
{"text":"Awesome local coffee beverages from Heartwood Roastery and Rising Star. Gluten free baked goods from So Sweet and vegan baked goods from Poisonberry and Cornucopia. It's so wonderful to see Nature's Bin's baked goods and side salads still being served. This place has so many amazing local products and such a friendly staff. My favorite products are definitely the Sage and Spice teas and aromatherapy. I am a huge fan of her products and it's great to be able to get them at this store! Also they have a delicious vegan peppermint, dark chocolate mocha!!!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This little market/coffee shop hybrid is the coolest addition to Lakewood. A few friends and I stopped here after reading positive reviews on Yelp, and we were glad we did!  I absolutely love places like this. Great food, coffee, atmosphere, and the added bonus of a small market to explore. They have a lot of healthy options as well as items you may not find in a regular grocery store. When it comes to the food, the best item on the menu is the frittata bowl, hands down. It's one of the most delicious yet surprisingly healthy breakfasts I've had in awhile. The mixture of eggs, greens, cheese, black beans, tomatoes, and guacamole is to die for. I've also tried the waffles and as mentioned in many other Yelp reviews, they are phenomenal. You really can't go wrong here. During my most recent visit, I noticed they have a create-your-own smoothie option where you check off items on a list and they then make a custom smoothie for you, which I can't wait to try soon!  An added bonus - when I stopped by on a Saturday morning, they actually had live music. I loved listening to live guitar while exploring the market. Nature's Oasis is a lovely addition to Lakewood and I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Nature's Oasis is fantastic. Friendly staff, great food (smoothies and sandwiches are oh-so-FRESH!). Go try for yourself -- it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great.  Fresh, yummy food.. great coffee and best of all happy, friendly people who work there and call you by name.  The also have grocery selections, most of which are made in Ohio.  Lot's to choose from if you are vegan or gluten free.  They have music at times on the weekend (check their FB for info)."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review for the market part of Nature's Oasis. I have to admit that I was surprised to hear about a new natural/organic market opening up on the heels of Nature's Bin's demise, but I can see that this place is different. It looks like they're going to rely more on the cafe side. I wasn't overly impressed with the market portion of the store as it has a very limited amount of products. That being said, they just opened, so maybe they'll develop that a bit more once they're generating some revenue and have a better idea of the needs of their customers. I loved how many local products they had on the shelves, however. If you want to shop local this is a great place for you. They carry Hartzler's milk which is pretty much the only brand you can get around here in a glass bottle. It's a little pricey, but they you pay a bottle deposit for your first one and if you bring the bottle back then you won't have to continue to pay the deposit. I'm looking forward to going back and trying out the cafe part of this place. Best of luck to the owners!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to Lakewood. Good coffee and the PBJ 2.0 was a fine sandwich. Clean place and the staff really cares about what they are doing."}
