{"text":"Best value for breakfast and lunch.  Good sized portions (dare I say the portions can be almost too big?!).  Service is friendly and usually fast - even when it's busy.  Beware of the parking lot though - it's a bumpy ride with lot of pot holes :-/"}
{"text":"One of my favourite breakfast/lunch places because you get good quality food at a decent price.  If you're a fan of peameal you MUST try the Great Canadian. Their eggs Benny are yum too.  For lunch I'd suggest the chicken or pork Slovaki on a pita. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Food: 4/10 Customer Service: 1/10  Food is OK, it isn't great and it isn't terrible either. However, the customer service here is terrible. The main server is horrible, I say main server because I've been here twice and she's usually the only one around. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Good food! Good portion, very filling! Lots to eat and good variety. Might take some time but worth the wait since its fresh. Friendly staff and ample parking."}
{"text":"It's a family owned mom and pop shop in an area where there's not that much around.  We love going there on the week-ends for a lazy brunch and a good cup of joe.     I like the Cyclops which is pancakes with a soft and runny egg in the middle.  served with your choice of meat and potatoes.  Very few restos offer pancakes AND eggs on the same plate.  Salty + Sweet, what's not to love?!  I've also ordered the peameal bacon and eggs (they give you three HUGE pieces of bacon which I can never finish!) and it's decent as well.  Veggie omelet is packed with veggies and I always find it hard to finish my plate.    We've always had swift service and with a smile, and the owner always stops by our table to see if we're doing okay.    Glad to have a place like this near us....every neighbourhood should have a place like this!"}
{"text":"Right off of Hurontario St, The tacky sign is VERY hard to miss.    The place looks a bit sketch and looks like another trucker stop over. This place reminds me to NOT judge a book by it's covering. That is why recommendation was invented.  Entering the lot, it's harsh on your tires and/or heels. Gravel rocks all around but TONS of parking room.   The place itself is quite big and walking in, there's 2 sets of doors. Entrance and Exit. Not sure how busy they expected to be but coming here for lunch, the restaurant was only quarter full. Mostly from all the businesses around.  Booths are placed up all along the walls of the restaurant and regular wooden tables  in the centre, seating 4 per table.  A large silver counter with the kitchen right behind it is extended all the way, facing the tables. The owner/manager comes around often. Naturally, to introduce himself and get suggestion/feedback. I thought this was quite nice.   The food is very Mediterranean with a random burger selection too. I had the chkn souvlaki plate and it was quite large. Comes with salad and rice or fries.  It was quite hearty but nothing extraordinary.  The waitresses are all 38+ and the kitchen seems to be decent in service.  The quality of almost everything looks recycled. Not a good sign. The food is definitely well prepared and presentation is neat. The service is not the best but I was there for lunch with a co-worker so maybe it just wasn't a good day.   When bill time arrived, the debit machine went down. Again, poor quality.  I had to use credit card, which isn't a biggie, until that wouldn't work either. They had to go old school and write down my credit card number.   For $13.55 it really wasn't worth my 10minutes of driving down Hurontario, walking through the gravel lot, the uncomfortable booth and the scratched up cutlery. The personable service is the only thing that would hold this place together.   Myeh.   xoxo M."}
{"text":"Ate at this place a few times many, many years ago (under different ownership).  Decided to stop in to see how it is now - very pleasantly surprised!  Looks are a bit underwhelming but the food is great.  Everything is freshly made and prepared/cooked to order.  We had the Chicken Souvlaki and the Calamari - both were very clearly cooked from scratch and very fresh - nothing frozen or pre-made here.  Juicy, tasty chicken, good Greek salad with rice and potatoes and the Calamari was fresh, tender and hot.  Portions are pretty large.  I like to eat a lot but I couldn't finish everything on my plate.  As I said, we were pleasantly surprised and very satisfied after eating lunch here.  I know it looks like a truck stop outside because of all the trucks parked in an adjacent lot but this place outdoes itself.  Highly recommended for a good casual meal.  Fine dining it isn't, but good food it is!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Nice place once tour inside, the outer appearance has you thinking twice."}
{"text":"I came in here straight out the shower with pajamas on and no makeup. The terrible weather today made my hair all messy... I thought for sure I wasn't going to be served as well as the other customers dressed in business attire, but I was wrong. I was acknowledged right away and a very sweet older lady gave me a booth to sit in. She asked right away if I would like anything to drink to start off as she gave me the menu. She came back right away with what I asked for which was water and coffee, and took my order right away. My food came out and it was sooooo good! I usually don't eat the potatoes/hash browns but the ones made here were very tasty and I had more than I could chew!! She then came to my table about 3 times asking how the food was and if I would like my coffee warmed up or filled up again, I was very pleased with her service. The last time she came to my table, she conversated with me about the terrible weather, she was so sweet -- i know what you may think, \"its their job\" -- but she was genuinely a very sweet person. She didn't care what I was wearing and how I looked. The manager even came out and asked me how the food was... I was very happy with the service and quality of food. I usually go to Coras and I thought that was a good place even though I hated their potatoes... I recommend this place to anybody! Their customer service was above exceptional and I felt no one judged me in there. I never had to wave the waitress over because she was content in accommodating my needs.  Thank you so much for making me feel so welcomed!!"}
{"text":"Came here last year on Mother's Day and the restaurant was so packed - the line up took a good 30 minutes before we were seated and then because all the orders were backed up, food didn't come until an hour later!!  Overall the food was just mediocre but I was very displeased when I found egg shells in my eggs.. Perhaps my unpleasant experience was due to the fact that it was Mother's Day but it still turned me off and I probably wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Found a great new breakfast spot! Delicious food, friendly people and wonderful service. We will be back:)"}
{"text":"I always passed by this place and sure at first it wasn't too appealing from the outside since all you see around was the trucks but who cares and don't be fooled my friends this is a little hidden gem.  The food is great and the portions are big,  the staff is super friendly and my wife and I love this place to have breakfast. I highly recommend this place and yes they accept debit and credit cards don't pay attention to the bad reviews."}
{"text":"We stayed in a hotel close to this breakfast place and we decided to go visit and boy OOF boy how glad that we did!! The food was delicious and the plate size was quite impressive and the customer service was awesome. We went there the next day!! I recommend this place and I give it 4 star cuz am still looking for the number 1."}
{"text":"I don't like to write negative reviews, but today's meal was horrible in this place and I will never go back. I ordered liver and onions. Liver was completely dry and burned. Potatoes and steamed vegetables were over salted, only onion was good. My husband ordered the rib steak on special - he asked for medium done. Well, from one side the steak was well done, from another side completely raw.  Never, never again. I am so upset."}
{"text":"Have passed by this place soo many times over the years and finally got to go for breakfast last weekend.  Everyone was very friendly, and the inside was pretty nice, nicer than I expected. I had a regular omelette and it was very good. Serving sizes are more than enough to fill you up.  Will definitely return again, maybe try the super breakfast next time."}
{"text":"I pass this place all the time when I work in Brampton and I'm a huge fan of Greek, so decided to check it out for lunch one day.  It looks pretty sketchy from the outside, but don't let the inside deceive you b/c the inside is actually pretty nice.  They must have renovated not too long ago as the inside has quite a homey feeling.  It's pretty big with a restaurant on one side and bar on the other.    The menu was surprisingly small, and I was really disappointed that they didn't have gyros!  I ended up getting a burger with a Greek salad.  Both were delicious.  Portions were perfect and it was pretty cheap.    I stayed to do some work after my meal, and it was no issue at all.  The server continued to fill up my drink and I didn't feel rushed at all."}
{"text":"It seems like a friendly, comfortable place.  The kids shared a huge order of chocolate chip pancakes.  My pork souvlaki was also huge, and delicious -- the meat was juicy, where I've almost resigned myself to always getting overcooked dry pork at other places."}
{"text":"Nice family greek restaurant, i have ordered the SUPER BREAKFAST which is good for atleast two people. Serving staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this grill. The portions are fantastic, the price is very good and the service is amazing. And of course the food is absolutely fantastic. The chicken is absolutely out of this world and the french fries were also very good. The breakfast is a little greasy but does not turn me off. Definitely recommend this place for breakfast, or lunch. And by the way breakfast served all day. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great portions. This place is what you think of when one mentions truck stop diner. Mostly frequented by regulars and cops. Great place. Service was a little slow. But it's a place one does not go when in a hurry. Prices and food is good. I had the Olympia Super 3 eggs bacon, sausages,  ham, home fries, fruit and 2 pancakes on the side. Couldn't finish it all. Aside from the service liked the place and would come back if in the area."}
{"text":"They have a great breakfast with great service, but stay away at dinner time! There is usually one lady there, Joanne, and she had much rather visit with family & friends that are sitting around, its surely an effort for her to properly wait on you! Will never go there at dinner time again, poor service! Stay away from the chicken wings they are pricey and you get only 5, and the fish & chips are horrible, fish is real pasty and mushy..."}
{"text":"Came here for a function with buffet style breakfast. There was lot's of room and the servers were attentive to coffee refills. The food was average but the set price of $28 was very excessive for what we got."}
{"text":"I have lived down the road from the Olympia Grill for the last 20 years (before it was called Grill One). As much as I want to say that I love this place- I can't. Its mediocre. The service is decent, the owner/manager is very kind, and the food is okay. The atmosphere is strange because half the \"diner\" is sort of a bar, and other half is diner (obviously). So although the diner area is nice you can't help but notice in the far corner this weird early 1980's trucker bar. Service= 3.5/5 Food= 3/5 Atmosphere= 2/5"}
{"text":"No decaf coffee, and no wifi, I guess most truckers don't use the internet. Prices are average at best and the food was ok."}
