{"text":"The food was very good and reasonably priced. Our group of 6 all had different sandwiches, and everyone was happy."}
{"text":"There was plenty of open tables, but we waited 15 minutes because they were so short on staff. We sat down and had to wait 10 more minutes for a menu. The Waiter was professional and apologized for the wait, but they only had 2 waiters for a restaurant with over 50 tables. We have now waited another 60+ minutes and our food has not shown up. Whatever the reason, this has not been an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"We chose the rodeside to cater our wedding. I have never had such good food at a wedding.  Everybody is still talking about it. I highly recommend Pete and his staff."}
{"text":"Bar is okay and the atmosphere is nice.  Food is below average and pricey. Our food was cold and when we commented on that the sever didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and terrific food. Staff was spot on and beer was cold. Great pit stop on the way up north. If you live in the area, great place for a regular stop."}
{"text":"Just had the \"heart attack\" scrambler. The best breakfast I've had! Genuine Chorizo made the dish. Another winner, Pete."}
{"text":"Try the corned beef Reuben!!!!!! We're from Minneapolis and I will miss this reuben :( The corned beef was pot roast style, not sliced. So yummy! Our service was also fantastic!"}
{"text":"Eh.  The corned beef was WAYheyhey salty! Veggies and potatoes a bit bland. Red wine was not aerated so wasn't close to its true form. I know I know it's a grill/bar but if you're going to serve it, serve it right or not at all. We were there with a group so it was nice to have the meeting room. Service was okay but not stellar. I'll probably stick to my pork sandwich I usually have next time and not try the special."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and probably only time last night. Had the all you can eat Fish and Chicken. The fish was okay but nothing special. The chicken was overcooked and very very dry. Son had a pasta dish with chicken and he complained about the chicken having a weird taste. Service was slow. Asked for more fish, ten minutes later I had to remind him. Second round of fish was worse than the first. Maybe it had been sitting for a while because the server forgot about it."}
{"text":"Our first trip to Rodeside Grill resulted in some of the longest wait times we've experienced. 45 minute wait for two meals?! I don't think so. Alas, the place was packed so we didn't want to write it off completely. The whole northwoods cabin vibe is just too quaint.   We stopped by with the kids for brunch on New Year's Eve day. We were literally one of two tables in the place. Jackpot, we thought. There's no way we'd have a long wait this time around. We were very wrong. This time we waited over 30 minutes for four breakfasts meals, three of which were simply pancakes. Sorry Rodeside Grill, you pulled us in with your convenient location and decor, but lost us on the just ok food and ridiculous wait times."}
{"text":"It was a good service restaraunt, stopped by in the area. Nothing particular stood out but I would recommend if you are looking for a decent place, price, and dishes.  Its not my \"cup of tea\" since I do like extremely healthy options but I can't complain. I had a burger which is my weakness and it was more than filling."}
{"text":"Stopped on a road trip, with the family.  Standard kid meal fare met with approval from the kids, my burger was juicy with well-cooked onions, and my wife enjoyed the tenderloin fajita wrap.  Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. The blackened salmon is hard to beat. I also enjoy the Bacon wrapped tenderloin.  For a delicious appetizer try the fiesta bruchetta, my favorite appetizer. Service is fantastic, we particularly like Lindsay. She is fabulous. She is able to take care of our needs and makes great suggestions from the menu. We have gone four weeks in a row and plan to return."}
{"text":"Waiter's crazily polite. I ordered the wrong thing and the waiter switched my dish with no second thoughts to cover my mistake. Plus the wings, clam chowder and ribs are perfect."}
{"text":"Organized a family luncheon for just under 30 people.  The gathering room just for our group was perfect.  When setting the reservation up the customer service was outstanding.  The waiter was exceptional at handling our noise, constant chatter, bad humor and individual bills.  Since the normal cook was out, the owner steps in and did an incredible job.  He personally visited the room to make sure everything was good.  My only disappointment was in the bartenders attitude, wish the exceptional customer service skills of everyone we encountered could have included him since this is one of the first places we all stopped when people arrived.  He seemed more irritated than willing to serve us.  I was ignored to the point of walking away and ordering from the waiter (who was one of the best waiters I have had).  Overall great fun for everyone and WILL go back.  The food menu offers variety and all comments I received were positive."}
{"text":"They have 50 cent wing night on Mondays in the bar! This alone would earn the 5 stars. The wings are so delicious and seem to be made fresh. The buffalo wings are made differently than the others are always come out a little soggy. The rest of the food is pretty standard bar food.  Several of the servers are fantastic, however, quality of service varies drastically based on the staff working. Unfortunately, we had to walk out one day - took 10 minutes to get a menu (server said he would bring some but didn't so we had to ask the host) and the server didn't come back for another 15 minutes.   If you are in the road and looking for a place to stop this is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"Good bar and the food is ok not remarkable but good.  Portions sort of skimpy but they ar ealways expanding the menu.  They do have a pretty good Rib eye however but nothing else was that memorable.  I will eat there again I'm sure."}
{"text":"We went for their Friday night fish fry. Atmosphere was very nice. Fish was really good when it was hot but half of the pieces we received were clearly sitting for a while. Also the chicken for their All you can eat special was not very fresh or hot. Best part of dinner was the dessert. I had the New York cheesecake and my wife had the Chocolate Pudding cake. Both were phenomenal. We will probably go back but would avoid the All You Can Eat items since it was very hit or miss."}
{"text":"Huge variety of choices for everyone. If you can't find anything to like here, you must not like food. I got the Cowboy steak with a loaded baked potato. This thing was big(16oz)! Not bad for a bar that doubles as a restaurant and a restaurant that doubles as a bar. I would definitely come here again to try other things."}
{"text":"Great service here and really good food. The dairy is from a local farm. I had the Sassy Cow cheese curds made with cheese from a local farm and the smokehouse burger. Make sure you try their ranch, it's also made in house. Our server, Roxy, was world class. Docking 1 star because the fries weren't too tasty. The ranch definitely saved them."}
{"text":"I chose the rib dinner which was a half rack with a choice of potato and salad or soup. The salad was okay a few of the leaves were lacking color but the veggies were really good inside of the salad. The half rack of ribs we're very tasty and the meat fell right off the bone didn't even need to fight it with a knife. The sauce was had a tangy sweet taste and the garlic mashed potatoes we're okay. I don't think I'll go back for the garlic mashed but I will go back for the ribs or anything else that was in the reviews before me. I did get a dessert to go the chocolate pudding cake but I haven't tried it yet. Service was good there were TVs around to keep track of the sports or you could talk with others. It was not so noisy so you can hear each other. Amazing how I pass by this everyday on my way to work and I've never come here. Now I know I can come here with confidence."}
{"text":"Here again.I often don't write unfortunately. Loved the pulled pork sandwich.we like all.had fish recently.all good.love all who work here as well.john the bartender tonight did what is expected."}
{"text":"The food here is great the only issue is the service. There's never a host waiting to seat you, and if you choose to sit in the bar area and not at the bar itself you'll be hard pressed to get service at all. Once you stand up and track somebody down they are pretty diligent about coming back and serving you but still 4/5 times i've had to track down staff myself."}
{"text":"Traveling through Wisconsin I needed to find some \"local\" food... I found it here. I was able to order some really good fried cheese curds and some walleye.  The young man who was the waiter desired some focus, but I think it was because the young girls looked much better than myself; so I understand his attention span.  Overall, nice place to eat and the cheese curds were good."}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered Roadside while house hunting in the area...simply put...good food, atmosphere and friendly and efficient service!!!  Highly Recommended!!"}
{"text":"Stuck in Lodi for the day, I couldn't find a place for lunch, and I dared not to try \"The Pizza Pit\" in town. I thought I'd head east and come here for lunch since I didn't find anything better. Years ago, this used to be a place called Stockade and I loved it. Now it's a Badgers/Packers bar and grill.   Visible from I-90, just west of Madison, there's a cheese place (Mouse Haus I believe) and warehouses for Pepsi and Walgreen's nearby. The Rodeside Grill resembles a log cabin style fort from the outside. Years ago, this place used to be called Stockade.  Once inside, it's quite spacious with high ceilings and an all wood interior, except for the tile on the floor. The whole place looks very clean, not grungy and aged like so many bars in Wisconsin. I sat down to eat at the bar. All along the bar counter, there were blurbs and excerpts of Packers and Badgers accomplishments underneath the laminated countertop. The place even had green-colored ductwork, so I knew I was deep in Packers territory.  A big screen TV aired game highlights from the Packers-Saints NFL season opener from the day before. Large men with mustaches came in for lunch, typical Wisconsin body types. I kept a low profile and my Chicago origin and calmly requested the Friday fish fry special. Having traveled up north on many occasions, this wasn't the first time I was surrounded by Packer fans. It's not hard to deal with them if you don't disclose where you're from and stick to the menu items or make a positive comment about Jordy Nelson being an awesome rising star on the team.  The fish arrived in a few minutes and it came with a side of fries that were seasoned and coated - quite tasty in fact. Coleslaw is also a can't-miss item north of Illinois and this place has it right too. I found the meal quite enjoyable. The bartender got me another iced tea and then spent a few more minutes of admiring the place. The Packers highlights gave way to NASCAR on the TV, but I was on my way, 150 miles from Chicago once again.  While I went for the fish, Rodeside also has some good burgers, from what I saw around me at lunch that day. Worth a stop on your way to the Dells or Lodi for that matter. Just leave the Bears stuff in the car."}
{"text":"Met a client there for lunch and I thought the food was good. It is located right off the highway so it is easy to get to. There is a private lot which makes parking easy and they did have lots of options on the menu. I had the philly beef sandwich that was pretty good. The other plus is they have lots of daily specials every day. Not sure when I would be back but I would not hesitate to bring a client there or eat lunch there if I found myself in the area."}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint! Came again today for lunch (late breakfast). I had the eggs, hash browns, pancakes- so yummy. Well done. My wife had the BBQ pork sandwich - AMAZING! So good. Great portions, great service, great prices. We need to come back more often."}
{"text":"It was okay. The diablo burger was good. My medium rare was done medium well. Tap water served.  I prefer distilled or purified at the least. Hubby got the bday discount of $9.99! Chase, the waiter, was awesome!"}
{"text":"We've been there twice during football games on Sunday afternoon and found the service and food spotty. Not literally but there was a piece of wrapping on the New York style cheesecake which was too big for one, had an attractive raspberry drizzle and served with spoons. This dessert was much like the restaurant, it seemed like fun at first, but was a little disappointing when you dug into it.  My mother enjoyed the club sandwich stacker both times and thought the seasoned fries were better the second time around. The fries weren't very well seasoned or fresh when I stole a few from her plate the first time, then a little crispier yet undercooked the second time I tried them.  My apple pork chops were also undercooked and made me wonder why since we were the only ones in the dining area at the time. The thick chops were covered with a few small slivers of apple which looked ridiculous and certainly didn't warrant calling them apple pork chops. The grill marks and flavoring reminded me of chain restaurant food and the flavor didn't improve when I took them home to cook more adding plenty of apple. They were too salty with a token bit of heat, and I'm guessing loaded with MSG. The apples I cooked it with tasted better than the meat which had a weird almost rubbery consistency. The rice reminded me of something from a packet loaded with sodium but was tasty and the best part of the meal. My French onion soup was the least salty part of the meal and not bad. I also liked their chicken soup from another visit which my mother termed \"just awful.\" I think because it tasted light, which is fine by me. Although the waiter offered to have the chops cooked more I opted to take them home and eat dessert there instead.  I ordered the apple crisp and after waiting more than the promised four minutes the waiter came back to say they were out. We did seem to wait a long time for this news and got charged for it even though they didn't have any. I didn't notice the charge until the next day.  It took four days, six phone calls, a few FB msgs and four different people before someone took care of the charge. The last person I spoke with must have been an owner or something because he was the only one who seemed genuinely sorry for and able to resolve the issue. The lemonade was not good and I only got a thin slice of lemon when I asked for it and wonder if the lemons or the drink were the problem. The best thing for me in two visits was the Nutella cookie served warm in a pan with ice cream. It hit all the right notes, not too sweet, chewy, crispy and creamy. My mother tripped over the inner all weather rug both times when it got caught in her walker. Because I was there and two different customers helped us each time she got out the door in one piece.  Neither time did anyone show us to a table making me think I misread the Wait To Be Seated sign, maybe it actually says Seat Yourself in which case, okay.Although on our second visit one of the wait staff looked right at us but continued her conversation with friends. The Nutella cookie sundae was so good they get an extra star, but I've had much better, consistent food at the A&W across the street."}
{"text":"Rodeside generously supports Waunakee's Project Graduation after party with amazing items from their catering menu.  Terrific food.  We appreciate your help in keeping our teenagers safe!"}
{"text":"It's nothing to brag about. The tables always feel dirty and the service is so slow. It's nice if you just want to hang at the bar though"}
{"text":"We broke down on the road and and eat here we had a very good meal. We would stop here again."}
{"text":"Went to the Rodeside Grill for the first time for lunch today.   The service was very fast and friendly.  Our waiter was amazing and was made sure we were well taken care of.  Both my husband and I ordered sandwiches with soup.  Him, the panini with three cheese tortellini soup and I had the BBQ pork sandwich (which was huge) with chili.  The soup was served with a warm roll.  Everything was very tasty and we will definitely be going back!  I already eyed up their breakfast menu..... They have an amazing Big Bloody Mary that will knock your socks off.  It is only served Sat and Sun but is well worth going in for.  https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13267769_10154289619785555_2622894867340924069_n.jpg?oh=0873eceda7646f4a5c9c1fc9c6833d6c&oe=57DACE5B"}
{"text":"We have been here for breakfast which is excellent.  The menu items are just a bit different so you don't encounter the \"same old same old\".  In search of a fish fry, tonight we tried two other places that were way too crowded for our liking and stopped here.  Same thing, completely full parking lot!  We went in and were seated immediately at 6pm.  By 6:20 we were finishing up our fish dinner.  They offer cod, bluegill, walleye and lake perch.  The lake perch was excellent and you get plenty of it, 6 pieces!  The cod had a light batter, not heavy at all. Great food and great service!  Someday we might try the 82 oz bloody mary which has a corn dog, hamburger, wing & much more."}
{"text":"Came here for mother's day brunch. We had reservations for 11 am. We had to wait about 15 minutes for our table. Not horrible considering how busy they were.  Overall the choices for the buffet were decent. I wish there would have been a little more selection for the dessert portion as they only had carrot cake and a brownie.  I can't comment on pricing as I'm not sure how much it was as my step mom paid. But we all left full and satisfied. So I would say it was worth it.  Because of the busyness of the morning the service was lacking a little. I never was offered a refill on my coffee."}
{"text":"Started off with some bloody Mary's, they were ok nothing special. But the service and the food that was the best part. We went for breakfast and both dishes were great! Had a mimosa that was great also. And our server was friendly and efficient. We are ready to go back for dinner some time!"}
{"text":"In the area on a motorcycle ride, read about the food and had to check it out. Stopped in for the all you can eat Prime Rib. They serve you a melt in your mouth 16 ounce first and 7 ounce after. Two of my brothers had the Prime Rib and 3 extra 7 ounce steak each. I think they almost ate all the Prime Rib in the house. The waiter was very good & informative of the food. If your in the area this is the place to go for great food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Service was awesome and the food was really good. I had a biscuit that was a little hard, but mostly a great experience for me and my family. We will be back."}
{"text":"This was a great stop on a road trip! It's clean, the staff are friendly and the prices are great! My husband and I both got burgers with fries and a soda. We walked out with a tab  under $25. The bathroom could use an update but it's clean. The chairs aren't the most comfortable but judging from the bar crowd, once you have a couple it doesn't matter. Would stop again to try different menu items as the burgers and fries were very good!"}
{"text":"All excited about the tostadas. When I received them they were ice cold. The only reason for the three stars was the service was super friendly."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious and authentic. Stopped over for breakfast while over near The American Center, and was very pleasantly surprised. Jukebox, great corned-beef hash, and a delicious scrambler. Healthy? Maybe not so much, but come on, that wouldn't be authentically diner would it?"}
{"text":"The chicken wings and other appetizers are excellent.  Service is good but not always. They are very supportive of the local community so I like to support them."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars if they could figure out how to make this place quieter. It doesn't matter how slow (or busy), whether you're in the bar or dining room - or even the semi-private dining area - this place can be deafening! You really have to focus on the conversation you're having at your table because you can hear everyone else's. I feel bad for the staff because you can tell they have a hard time as well.    We've been here for fish fry twice in the last few months and have had wonderful service and food both times.  My husband likes that they have walleye as an option which he got both times.  My mom's boyfriend enjoys the all-you-can-eat fish and chicken option.  The prices are very fair and the portions are spot on.  Even though the place was packed both times (came around 5p one time, 7:30p the second time), the service was quick and the food came out in a decent amount of time.    Rodeside can hold a lot of people so don't be put off by the parking lot if it's full.  They have some arcade games and pull tabs if you need to entertain yourself during a wait =)"}
{"text":"We went tonight for Friday night fish fry, they got our order wrong (hash browns with cheese and onions when we ordered fries???).  It was fine, they brought us lukewarm fries, we piled the unwanted hashbrowns on a plate.  My daughter's burger that we ordered medium well was delivered medium rare, when asked to fix the waiter sighed and said he could throw it back on the grill.  When we got our bill, we were charged for the cheese and onions that we didn't eat or want, we pointed it out to the waiter and when we got the final credit card receipt he had not changed it.  Life is too short to have so many mistakes that came with little apology or desire to remediate the problem.   We won't be going back which is a bummer because it's a 5 minute trek from our house.  Additionally the fish was not hot, fishy tasting and overall not good."}
{"text":"The food is so-so (shaved prime rib), the service is fine, and it is very noisy. The price was fair for what you get."}
{"text":"I was traveling with my cousins from Michigan to Minneapolis, and this was a roadside pit stop for us in Wisconsin. The place looks really good but I was really disappointed with their food. We reached there at around 1:30 PM in the afternoon and they were serving brunch!! I was slightly skeptic about it and went ahead to see what they got in their brunch buffet!! Almost everything sucks in their menu except the omelette and bacon. They had some donuts, muffins, bacon, cut fruits, scrambled egg, pancakes with two different types of maple syrup, sausages, beef, ham, shrimp and some cakes. They even had a live omelette bar where the chef was standing and looking at others faces instead of letting people know that it's is a live omelette bar. Half the time, he wasn't available as they ran out of butane and hence he was taking the omelette mixture with our choice of add-ons to the kitchen to prepare it and getting it back to the customers. Everyone including me for the first 35 minutes just saw that section, didn't knew what to do and left. Later my sister figured it out that it was an omelette bar which made me go there and order one. Omelette was one of the item which didn't disappoint me. The fruits were just randomly cut and thrown into a huge bowl that was just lying in a place for a very long time which eventually changed the taste of the fruits. Pancakes were okay. The maple syrup wasn't up to the mark. Donuts sucked. Muffins were average. Bacon is good. Sausage and scrambled egg were okay. Cakes weren't good. Shrimp - I didn't even touch them looking at the presentation. The staff weren't friendly enough. They didn't even take care of us properly. They were in bloody hurry always though it was just a brunch going on . They were not changing or replacing the dishes on the buffet counter. They weren't even picking the plates off our tables until I went to one of them and asked them to replace them.  I didn't like the food and the service at this place. I don't know how it would be if I order from the menu. Maybe it would be good as per the other reviews. But they didn't pull off the brunch properly. The cost of the food wasn't worth it at all. It was a waste of money. I left the place unsatisfied and disappointed."}
{"text":"The Rodeside Grill did an amazing job tonight!  We were incredibly impressed given our last experience. We were greeted and seated immediately.  Our drinks and starters came in a very timely manner.  Both our server and management were incredibly attentive.  I had the stuffed chicken and my husband had the unlimited ribs. The food was great with generous portions. Neither of us could finish our plates.  My husband cannot say enough about the ribs and chicken special, great flavor. we also enjoyed the creamy tomato basil soup. I particularly enjoyed the homemade ranch dressing. We splurged for the chocolate peanut butter cheesecake which was also amazing.  I will certainly recommend this establishment to friends and family and I strongly foresee us returning in the near future.  Thank you Rodeside Team and Management for listening to our feedback and turning it around! I appreciate that service more than you know!"}
{"text":"The PERFECT Roadtrip pit stop! Super friendly service (he even gave us wonderful recommendations on where to go on our trip!), delicious food and plenty of awesome local beers on tap! We couldn't have been happier."}
{"text":"I ordered a tenderloin Fajitas and received my fajitas without the tortillas.  I asked my waiter for some tortillas and he responded, \"Oh yeah, he left them in the microwave.\"  I was hungry and started to eat while waiting for my tortillas.  I noticed on the menu it states that the Fajitas are supposed to come with rice and beans except on Wednesdays when the Fajitas are the special all you can eat.  It was Tuesday night so I guess I should have had beans and rice with the $15.99 meal.  I couldn't finish what I had so didn't miss the rice and beans but one likes to get what they paid for-right?  The food I was served was tasty and surprising as the edges on one side of the flour tortillas had a crunch to them so when I but that one spot on each tortilla I would hit the crunch.  Not sure how they did that when the tortillas were In a plastic tortilla bowl/server with a lit.  My husband had a chef\"s salad which he enjoyed.  It was served with a dinner roll which showed up down the road.    Both orders showed up fairly quick except for the delayed tortilla chips.  Others at our table mentioned they come there often.  One had the chicken wings and they looked big and tasty.  My husband mentioned he would like to go back to try the chicken wings."}
{"text":"My parents make a point to come to the Rodeside Grill for the Fish dinners on Friday.   We were having a family gathering and the restaurant was able to accommodate our group of nine.  Did I mention it was a busy night?  The parking lot was very full when I got there.  To the point that cars were parked on the grass, along the street, and at the neighboring hotel.  Be patient as you search for a spot or plan for a bit of a walk to the door.  I was the last one to arrive.  The group ordered nachos to stem the tide.  Word was the nachos were good and easy to share.  Most of us ordered a fish dinner.  My brother ordered the Italian steak sandwich.  It was a generous sandwich with peppers and onions.   My cousin on the other end ot the table had a sandwich also but I couldn't  tell what he had.  I had the Walleye dinner.  Fried filets of tender Walleye.  Served with coleslaw, choice of potato,  and the fixings for the Fish  (lemon wedge, tartar sauce).  I enjoyed my fish with a baked potato.   Several guests ordered mixed vegetables instead of a starchy potato and a baked cod.  Our server did pretty well with our large group.   He did mix plate locations but he checked with us a good amount of time.  He handled the bill split relatively well but handed the wrong bill to the wrong person.   He had a nice smile so easily to forgive.  It was a good night"}
{"text":"I literally drive an hour to get here for Monday night wings in the bar. Great place, great staff, great atmosphere. Wish I lived closer to try everything else on their menu!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  A group of seven of us ate at this restaurant last Saturday.  The location is very convenient.  The ambiance is very casual, yet nice.  The menu has a nice variety (sandwiches/burgers/pasta/fish).  I had a the bowtie pasta, which the menu said was spicy and it was.  Not too incredibly hot you couldn't eat it, but it diffenetly had a nice bite.  It came with a soup or salad and was more than enough food.   Others in our party had a fish sandwich, tortilla encrusted tilapia, burito, pork roast and a couple of salads.  All were very satisfied with their dinners.  I disagree with other users that the prices are high.  I found them to be extremely reasonable for the quantity and quality of food you are given.  Beers/wine also seems to be reasonable.  I had a glass of pinot grigio and it was only $4.95.  I was extremely impressed with the service.  The restaurant was busy and our waitress told us a large order had just came in and she apologized for the wait.  Despite all of the people in the restaurant, our wait was not excessive.    I wish I lived closer.  This is worth going to again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, clean establishment, and fair prices. Minus one star for inconsistent quality of food (good 3/5 times)"}
{"text":"Food is average, but for the prices they charge, it should be better.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome. Food was great waitstaff was friendly. Basically all you could ask for in a restaurant. I especially like the hometown atmosphere here."}
{"text":"Stopped in here late night on a Saturday while on the road. I wasn't expecting much being next to a hotel. I was pleasantly surprised! I had the steak sandwich and fries with a bowl of chili. Everything was excellent! All you can eat prime rib on Saturday night? I'm in! The food got out to us FAST and our waitress was Johnny on the spot! If I didn't live 120 miles away I'd be a fixture at this place! My ONLY complaint about the Roadside is their menus could use a good wiping down.  If you want a great meal for a reasonable price please give this place a try."}
