{"text":"Although the new decor is nice, I honestly rather have the old restaurant back. Portions are small and pricey, and they take forever to come. Worst of all I couldn't even enjoy the new decor as my family and I got placed in the dingy basement. How unfortunate."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight.  They have completely renovated the place and the restaurant looks nice.  

We passed on the set meals and ordered a la carte, instead.  We got black bean snails, garlic pork ribs, chicken livers with cauliflower, chive flower with mixed meats and halibut head in broth.  The dishes are really small and not really good.  The black bean sauce was too gloopy and the dishes were a tad too sweet.  You are paying a lot for each dish and sometimes you want quality over quantity.  But here you don't get quality or quantity.  You're basically paying a premium for the renovations.  
The menu is a mish mash of Cantonese, Sichuan and Fujinese cuisines.  Maybe one style might be decent but what we ordered wasn't that great.  

They have a lot of seafood set dinners, maybe they are better.  The washrooms are in the basement and there's also a karaoke/vip room downstairs too.  Not somewhere that I would frequent again, my kids said that they'd prefer to go north a bit  and queue up at Dong Kee instead."}
{"text":"Perhaps the worst, possible dining experience ever in a \"seafood\" based restaurant.

Seated for a table of 13 for Christmas Eve, and needless to say, they crammed every possible nook and cranny in the restaurant with people. The entire restaurant literally was over capacity to the point where waitresses were shoving families to move in further and having them stand up to make way to deliver the food.

Dessert was burnt. Food was bland, small, and frankly disgusting. Lots of oil, lots of bone, minimal food. For a table of 13, the bill was slightly over $500 with tips, and yet, we left still feeling hungry, nauseated by the oil, and needless to say will not be returning ever.

Hop down the street to Keung Kee, or even a take-out joint in front of YeeHong Centre is more tasteful and less of a headache."}
{"text":"They allow customers to smoke inside the restaurant. So no matter how the food taste, I won't come again and I won't recommend it to anybody (unless you are a smoker and would like to smoke indoor)."}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant of Top 1 in Richmond Hill. I have to give them credit in how they renovated the previous restaurant into something that is clean and upscale. 

But is that alone enough to bring in business? How about 10% off? Not really, as I doubt I would be back.

Soup was a not a good start as the menu described as traditional soup of the day but we got a funky snow pea sprout with corn starchy soup.

The main were not bad as the beef tenderloin though over sauced but tender but with no honey black pepper flavour. Lobster and fried rice were ok but be careful of sand inside the veggie.

Dessert was one of the worst red bean soup I ever had.  A watery soupy mess.

Service though is friendly but even the waitress realizes how bad was the dessert, I think there is an issue.

Will be a pass.. $48 for a set dinner for 2? There are way better options in Scarborough than here."}
