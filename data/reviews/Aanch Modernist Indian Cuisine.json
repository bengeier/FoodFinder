{"text":"The food here was delicious. Ordered the lamb tak-a-tak and it was spicy, flavourful and tender. The fish tikka was delicious and it came with a fresh chatni that tasted like it came right out of moms kitchen. Dal Makhni was creamy, spicy and deeply flavourful. I had the palak paneer and they got it right - it's spicy and smooth without being overly greasy. 
Friendly service and healthy portions rounded out an excellent experience. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really good place to have delicious and flavourful Indian food using good quality ingredients!We went with a large party and were given excellent service and good quality food. The chef/owner came by to check on us on several occasions. I would highly recommend the palak paneer, chicken tikka masala and kofta dilbahaar. Will be returning here soon!"}
{"text":"We're in Toronto on vacation and found this place thanks to Yelp!  We love Indian & have sampled it in cities around the world.  The interior is very nice and warm. The bar selection is extensive.  The menu has lots to choose from & the food was very good! We had the Fish Pakora appetizer to start, delicious. Then I had the Paneer Tikka Masala & asked that it be prepared mild, because I'm a wimp.  It came out too spicy for me, but was better after adding a side of raita to cool it down. My husband got the Dilliwala Butter Chicken. He prefers very spicy & this was only medium to his palate.  So spice/heat levels can vary. Service was stellar until a large party came in, then there was a bit of scrambling to catch up. 

We were overall very happy with Aanch and recommend it!"}
{"text":"I thought I wasn't a fan of Indian food UNTIL I had dinner in this place. The food is amazing, the service is great and the chef even gave us a complimentary dessert since we were celebrating my mother in law's birthday.
Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for higher end Indian.  Spacious, modern setting.  Good selection of veg dishes and a decent wine list at reasonable prices.  Good service that made excellent suggestions.  I'm putting it on my Toronto rotation."}
{"text":"It's a great place. I loved the starters/appetizers (5 star). Being an indian, I felt the main courses were little bland but the flavour is amazing. So far, it's my fav Indian restaurant in Downtown Toronto ..  Service was good and over all, it's a nice place :)"}
{"text":"Was going to order from a food delivery app. About to click \"order\" when noticed Naan bread was $5 EACH. 

Sorry, but no naan is worth $5. I've been to some pretty nice/upscale Indian restaurants in Toronto and while traveling- never seen a price like that. I'll take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I only took one star away because the service could be tweaked a bit."}
{"text":"Very high-quality food and friendly and hospitable service. 

The lamb vindalu was very tasty

Wife's chicken lambada was terrific too

Saffron rice and garlic naan great, as was the tasty mango / pistachio pudding ice cream! 

I highly recommended"}
{"text":"Absolutely superlative ! I have eaten at aroma  here in Toronto but have to say this is way ahead. The ambience , service and freshness of the food ."}
{"text":"We liked this restaurant very much. Excellent garlic naan. Surprise rice pudding mango sorbet dessert!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place as it opened at the location of erstwhile restaurant - 259 Host. I understand that the chef and staff are the same and have taken over as new owners! The place is also renovated with a new bar.

We ordered Veg Tikka, Rosemary Naan, Shahi Paneer and Peas Pulav. All items tasted perfect! The only spoiler was the wait time for the food to arrive, otherwise would have rated 5 star!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was excellent. We had butter chicken (so good) and veggie platter. If I come back to Toronto, I will definitely stop by here."}
{"text":"We're staying at the hotel next door and came in right as they were closing, but they let us in, and the food was AMAZING!!!! We ordered the chicken tikka masala and rosemary naan, and both were incredible!!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered on Uber eats and it was delicious food! Best I've had downtown Toronto. Only reason I knocked a star is because the biryani was very spicy... I loved the heat and spice level, but I think others would suffer. They should just note spice level. Can't wait to have to again!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice Indian restaurant for a birthday dinner and decided on Aanch after reading reviews on here. How they have 4  1/2 starts, I'll never know. We sit down at the table and I notice the table cloth is dirty and the wine glasses have lipstick on them. Knowing we're not going to order wine, we don't say anything. When the waiter brings us water, the glasses both have some crusted food stuck on them and we ask for new ones. The new glasses come out and this time one is clean but the other has some lipstick remnants. We order and when the appetizer comes out, the samosa sampler, they're delicious, but all the same - not really a sampler. When the mains come out, they bring us new plates that I notice have a bit of crusted food and are what looks like soot around the rim which came off with a bit of water and my napkin. This is when we decided to leave without finishing. We spoke to the manager who was very understanding and refused to let us pay for the food we did eat and promised the next time we came it would be clean. So while I'm completely I unimpressed by the restaurants cleanliness, the manager handled it very well."}
{"text":"This is really one of the nicest Indian restaurants I have been to. The service was prompt, the food was fresh and promptly served, loved the spinach and goat cheese appetizer, was a huge serving for the 2 of us, but we are it all. 
The rest of the courses were also very good, we had no room for dessert but we finally had that too...would have loved to go again but we ran out of time"}
{"text":"Partner and I love Indian food and used to come here all the time when it was still called 259 Host. We were pretty devastated when 259 Host shut down earlier this year. So when Aanch opened we knew we had to pay a visit. 

Food- 4/5. Pretty extensive menu, but vegans/dairy-intolerant people beware... almost every single dish and sauce has dairy! I ordered from the vegetarian menu, but had to ask the chef to omit dairy from the Mushroom Medley. The only 2 vegan mains are the cauliflower and the okra dishes. Vegan carbs is rice since all the naan breads are made with dairy. My vegetarian partner really enjoyed his dishes though! The rosemary naan was especially well liked. Our only criticisms about the food are that the mains were a tad too spicy and too oily. Overall the dishes are very similar in taste, quality, and selection to 259 Host. Portion sizes are also larger here compared to other upscale Indian restaurants in the GTA.

Ambience - 5/5. Clean, quiet, romantic."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Wish it were in Dallas-Food was fresh and flavors bright, just the right amount of heat, and delightful waiters. Recommend the Butter Dilliwala Chicken, Chicken Xacuti and Mughlai Korma!!"}
{"text":"If you have never eat at any proper indian fine dinning than this place is for you . Waste of money with No food taste at all . Poor preparation and poor presentation with overly hiped prices. Even there draught beer tasted like water"}
{"text":"Very exciting cuisine.  Shrimp with coconut curry was spectacular.  The Chicken vindaloo was spicy and comforting.  We had excellent services and a wonderful evening.  Best Indian cuisine I've had in a long long time."}
{"text":"Mix up with Paypal voucher and Foodora but not the restaurant's fault delayed delivery. Once sorted out delivery was prompt and food hot.
Chicken Xacuti ( relatively rare Goan dish) was 5 star. You could taste the dark roasted spices and ginger and it was tangy, just the way ti was supposed to be. Vindaloo was excellent too and the ingredients in both were top quality. The Baingan Bharta was mediocre but you could get a faint charcoal flavour so bonus points for that. The Chicken biryani was where things came apart. The chicken was plentiful and flavourful and of top quality. The spicing however was off with a cominance of some strange flavour (nutmeg?) overpowering everything else. Also too many pieces of strange green leaf mixed in (fresh coriander?) through it and I am not a great coriander fan. The rice arrived not quite cooked and with residual liquid in the bottom which told me it had been hurried and not allowed to cook properly.
As I said the place uses top quality ingredients but it comes at a price. These 4 items cost almost $90 after delivery, taxes and tips and while the quantity gave me dinners for the next 4 days I would not have paid this if it hadnt been for an unusally generous promo from Paypal I would not have ordered from here."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Spicy, but not overwhelming, even for my 7 year old daughter. We loved the chicken tikka masala and my husband really enjoyed the lamb vindaloo. It was his first experience with Indian food and I think it will be hard to beat! The food came timely, but it took a while to get the check and leave, otherwise a great experience!"}
{"text":"While Aanch has been a bit hit-and-miss in the past, the general quality of food is quite good. It is a cut above the rest of the Indian options around in the GTA, where you get the same brown sauce on everything. 

But what I like best about Aanch is that they have some offerings that are unique, like the Tundae kebabs, the Stuffed Okra or the Nutella Samosa (which I haven't tried personally) and these are the ones you should go for. The Tundae kebabs took me back to India, they were the perfect consistency, the lamb minced so fine that it needs no chewing, with the perfect crunch on the outside.

I for one will keep going back for more, and recommend anyone looking for good Indian food to try Aanch as well!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the portions were generous for an upscale restaurant. Service was excellent but I suspect that had something to do with the fact they knew I was going to review them on yelp (they brought us free appetizers and dessert...). My one complaint is that there was a lipstick stain on my wine glass. Would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Heads up that this is a review based on a Foodora delivery order, so it's probably even more amazing fresh and in person. We ordered soooo much food from here tonight and the flavours were all incredible. I'll try to remember everything: samosas (light, flakey, packed with flavour, mango mint chutney highly recommended); we got two types of raita, one with boodni, one without, both cool and refreshing; malai kofta was incredible - nutty and fragrant; rice was beautifully but subtly spiced; palak and mattar paneer - both excellent; Channa - a bit too spicy but otherwise delish; chicken tikka masala - nice thick curry with good quality white chicken breast. The only two things that weren't stand out amazing were the daal (a bit plain) and the eggplant (a bit too smoky for some), but otherwise awesome. And of course, the most important thing - the naan!!!!! Delicious enough to convert any carb hater. We didn't get any of the desserts but I'm tempted to go in person to try the full selection. Lunch menu looks great too! Super happy to have discovered this new place :)"}
{"text":"Brought a big group here to kick off a friend's bachelorette party--they were happy to accommodate us.  The food was phenomenal (and I am a huge Indian food snob), and the staff handled our group of 17 expertly.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was blown away by their authenticity on every item..these are the following items I ordered:

App:
Rosemary Naan: extremely interesting twist with drizzles of aioli and cuts of cabbage along with rosemary used as topping ... unique...

Main 
Chicken 65: spicy, seriously I heard my self snapping on small green chillies and felt the sweat drop down my forehead ...nothing like a cold glass of water won't extinguish...don't be scared it was soooooo good!

Dessert
Paan Kulfi : so the top red part is the gooo inside the meetha (sweet) paan, gravy white stuff is like ras malai liquid, and the Kulfi is the khoya Kulfi.....daaaaaamn good
It's huge 3 people can share it

Great ambiance amazing service! Delicious food! This place is a hit!"}
{"text":"Truly amazing food and my new favourite place in the city for Indian dishes.

Will update this review after I've been a few times but my first impression leads me to give this place a very strong recommendation."}
{"text":"Excellent meal at Aanch.  The tandoori shrimp were just delicious, wonderfully spiced.  Excellent service all around."}
{"text":"Everything we ate was delicious! Chickpea/spinach kebabs stuffed with goat cheese appetizer (photo attached), garlic naan, lamb Rohan josh and chicken Lababdar, which was fantastic! Nice setting and service too. My new go to Indian restaurant in TO."}
{"text":"Man oh man! This is my second time trying Indian food (I know I know). But my first time was from my friends grandparents authentic kitchen. So I think I can judge :). 

Anyways, to start. We had the okra appetizer. It's basically fried okra, and I did enjoy it. I really like okra so no disappointment there. I wanted sea food but didn't want something too saucy so I got the malai shrimp and rice. Both were really good. I'd recommend getting something saucy though as I'm sure that has a lot more flavor. My co workers got the paneer tika Marsala and the garlic naan. We shared so I got to try a little bit of everything. Nothing disappointed! I enjoyed all the food so much and it was very flavorful. To end it we had dessert, rice pudding and mango ice cream. It was the perfect way to end it. Perfect amount of sweetness.

The setting is really nice. And the plating of the food is really pretty to be honest. For sure recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious food - although pricier than typical Indian food but worth it. I find that it's rare to find a nice sit-down Indian restaurant in downtown and Aanch had a much nicer ambiance than I had anticipated. 

Initially, I had ordered Aanch on UberEats and decided that I must go try the food in person as well. It did not let down. Overall, I'd say I wouldn't pick this place as my go-to casual Indian place but definitely will come back if I am going to have a proper dinner with friends.

Mains were around ~$20 to $25 dollars but the curries were some of the best that I've tried. 

The service was great and the waiters were attentive."}
{"text":"A very average experience. I ordered a chicken thali and it came out with a very good presentation. The veggie stuff in the thali was nice but the chicken items were not that great. My main issue was with the service. The guy serving me was either lost or particularly rude. 
I'm not sure if i should return or recommend it to anyone. 
I run a food enthusiast club in Toronto and we were thinking of organizing our next meetup at Aanch but this below average experience is saving me from doing that. 
Also, the prices are definitely on the higher side."}
{"text":"I walk by this place everyday, but never really noticed it until my nephew dragged me down here for dinner. And I was not disappointed. A tidy restaurant with its modern take of classic Indian dishes. As clichéd as butter chicken is when it comes to Indian restaurants, Aanch gets special mention because it is right up there with the top three butter chicken places in town. Try it with their Rosemary naan for a flavourful experience, its like Diwali in your mouth. Reserve ahead if you are a bigger group because this place is packed, but a table of two walk-in should be easy to get with a relatively short wait time. Affable staff and a personable chef who checks in with patrons in person. My new go to place for Indian grub in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"A friend and I were looking for Indian food while in Toronto for the weekend. We popped into Aanch and the service was great, but the food was fairly lack-luster. It wasn't bad, but it was't particularly flavorful. When it comes to Indian food, not flavorful is just.....confusing. 

As I said, service was great, but prices were high and food wasn't worth the visit. There's great Indian food in Toronto - I'd skip this place."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto and got stuck in the horrid April storm of 2018! Walked into Aanch, in a large building but nice looking restaurant next to the Residence Inn. Three levels of tables, nice bar with draught Ontario offerings, one an excellent lager. Excellent service, Manager stopped by the table and all tables. The food was delicious. Papad's with two traditional dipping sauces, Lamb Rogan Josh, Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala were perfect temperature for all. The rice was plentiful and hot. Garlic and plain naan bread perfectly cooked. Excellent value for really good quality and service. You should not be disappointed, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great service, value and a delicious twist on Indian cuisine. 

I came here for lunch today enticed by the \"modernistic\" moniker in the title and also the yelp reviews. I was greeted warmly and seated at the bar where the staff promptly made friendly conversation. I got good recommendations on the menu and ultimately opted for the seafood thali. What a treat. The dish came with 3 bite size fish pakoras, lentils, potatoes, naan, pappadum, shrimp malabar, rice, yogurt, salad and a choice of gulab jamun or rad malai for dessert. The server forgot to ask my choice and brought gulab jamun, but when I asked for ras malai, he brought me that and didn't exchange it. I got two desserts! 

The lentils were a little salty for my taste, but I loved loved loved the shrimp. It's a perfect helping of 4-5 shrimp in a savoury tomato sauce. And the rice was so fragrant! The naans were perfectly tender and had a nice grilled flavour. I wasn't a fan of the potatoes, but that's not to say they weren't delicious. The gulab jamun was a healthy size and sweet! And the ras malai was liht, creamy, not too sweet, and generously showered with pistachios. I liked the place so much I topped off my meal with a steaming cup of unsweetened chai. 

This place is great, it has a nice intimate atmosphere. You should come."}
{"text":"Been here in Toronto for a while and for the most part I've been disappointed by the food. Then there is aanach! I have tried so many things from this menu all great. Some of the best Indian I've had. Biryani's are flavorful and full of color and spice! Lobster jalfrezi solid, curries are good, bread very good too. Fast service. Good people! Check it out."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful quaint restaurant right in downtown Toronto. Wonderful service, really friendly staff and their Samosas were delicious - crunchy and fresh! Their Dum Biryani was the best we have had so far! Wish I could have packed some food back on the plane :( . Can't wait to come back when we are in Toronto again."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something different from my normal lunch fare and was excited to see that a new Indian restaurant opened up in the entertainment district. The interior is very modern and is definitely the type of atmosphere where you can have a business lunch. There were definitely a few of those around me when I was there.

The lunch menu seems to focus on thali, which allows you to sample a variety of options for a single price. Apparently, there is a separate Monday/Wednesday/Friday menu and a Tuesday/Thursday menu. I ordered the chicken thali with chicken curry. I asked for the khalfi (ice cream), but I don't think the waiter heard me and I was given the kheer (rice pudding).

The thali came with an appetizer of a samosa and Tandoori chicken. I really enjoyed the samosa and the Tandoori chicken was really well cooked and perfectly spicy. For carbs, there was basmati rice, a papadum, and a naan. The papadum was thin and crispy and the naan was soft. I wasn't expecting to get both, so it was a pleasant surprise. Next to the carbs was the chana pindi, which is a chickpea dish. The chickpeas were perfectly soft and tender. I don't recall the vegetable dish, but it was delicious and quite spicy. I used the yogurt raita to reduce the heat. The chicken curry was excellent. At first, I thought it was too sweet, but over time it became less sweeter and much more spicier. The chicken was not dry. Finally, I tried the dessert and I'm glad that it was delivered instead of the ice cream. It tasted like rice in a sweet milk sauce and was enjoyable to eat. During lunch service, the chef came out and asked everyone about the food. He was very gracious.

I am not a connoisseur of Indian food at all. However, I really enjoyed the food at Aanch and will very likely come back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Lots of veg and nonveg variety of modern Indian food. The chef is very creative and combines authentic indian taste with modern presentation to make interesting cuisine. We really enjoyed our meal and time and difintely will visit soon again!"}
{"text":"The lunch thali is the best bang for your buck you can get and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Really good north indian delhi restaurant. Ambiance, classy layout, well balanced authentic food. Hand the lamb biriani - delectable. Kulchas were fantastic too."}
{"text":"So fantastic! Four of us went for lunch and got the jackfruit masala, tikka masala paneer, gohbi masala, dal bukhara, rice, and the samosa platter. Could not have asked for a better meal - we loved it! Great atmosphere and very hospitable."}
