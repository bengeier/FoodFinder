{"text":"The Coffee is great and Everyone is nice. It's on a polish hill. I enjoy it very much. They have things to eat here that taste very good. The building is made of bricks and it's building shaped which I like."}
{"text":"This spot is very cool. Love the vibe and the counter spots are awesome. There are a few extra tables in the back room, so don't let it deceive you. Service is solid.   Now, let's talk food. Hubs ordered a black tea and banh mi and I got the special, red bean French toast and eggs. The tea is wonderful, a good balance of flavors and very smooth. Hubs said I tricked him into going to a vegan place, but he ate every last bite of the banh mi. As for the red bean French toast, the flavor of the red bean was awesome with a nice level of sweetness that I didn't find syrup necessary. I was debating on getting a cinnamon roll based on other reviews and was about to grab one as we were heading out, but alas they ran out! Blast! Next time. There will be a next time!!  The food is good and I'm not sure if they have the space figured out quite yet. The advantage of sitting at the counter was the ability to see the cooking. They did a lot of prep in advance to expedite the process, but there is two hot plate like burners and another small spot to cook. There was a constant flow while we were there and the small equipment couldn't keep up. The cook was doing great with the resources and made sure the food was quality. So, keep in kind the food is great, but it can be slow.  Will report back on the cinnamon roll and, hopefully, the doughnuts!"}
{"text":"This place just opened 3/5 I came across them via wolftree donuts vegan donuts I have bought at a nearby tea shop This is a small place with about 9 tables And some counter space Looks much cleaner and hipper then the place that used to be here Menu has some yum sounding sammies With nice vegan and vegetarian choices With such offerings as eggs, Lox and cream cheese ,bagels a banh mi and punk toast (avocado) I opted for the TLT tempeh lettuce & tomato with vegan mayonnaise  Loved it thin toasted white bread made this extra yum  Lattes And coffees  And my choice was chai tea served up nice n hot in a big cup.  There is honey cardamom on the menu that's going to be my next try beverage.

{"text":"Good coffee & great  lunch - chick pea bowl with kale & red peppers & sauce -   Good food - comfortable place"}
{"text":"I had been here twice before the change and I just have to say YAY. Whilst the parking may sucketh...the food and options are improved for vegans so I didn't care that we had to parallel park on the \"wrong\" side of the street on a 90% grade.....  Good tunes, still hipster of course but I'm not bothered by that. Great Kaibur breakfast & my DH had the staple Punk Toast....we each ordered a side of setain to try it out - AMAZE. They managed to season it and it tasted a bit like bologna - weird but good for sure. Great texture.   Prices are NOT MENTAL, line ups are.We arrived shortly before 10 and there was a decent wait. There was room at the bar and at tables - a lot of takeout.   We moved away from the neighbourhood last summer but we will be heading back often now for breakfast for sure.   Great americanos as well.   Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I was a fan of Lili, the shop which occupied this location since it opened. Kaibur has taken this neighborhood coffee shop to a new level, expanding the offerings and seating. Meals are simple, nutritious and quickly served. Coffee is very good too. Staff is attentive and helpful. They've kept the vinyl turntable vibe going."}
{"text":"Went here today.  I had the Reuben and it was totally satisfying and a great price.  The place is quaint, friendly and inviting.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"What happens when you take Lil's Cafe and rebrand it? The answer is Kaibur Coffee! The business is not under the same ownership as Lil's nor is the staff the same. Their former sister cafe Lilliput has acquired some of their staff.  I am pleased with the fact that the new staff has chosen to retain both a breakfast and lunch menu that can be made vegan friendly. When you go inside you will still see some of the remnants of Lil's since they had just opened. I arrived during the lunch hour and the place was packed.  The desserts looked very inviting-especially the Hamentachen. Purim was last week so I figured they must be left over. Vegan desserts are marked with a \"v\".  I wanted get that vegan pie they were offering for dessert but they were sold out.  I was debating what to get when the lady in front me suggested I go with the vegan egg sandwich on toast. I did just that. When my turn came I inquired about a phone number and learned they took out the phone. I ordered my vegan egg sandwich made with tofu scramble, vegan cheese, and vegenaise and tomato. The man behind the counter told me he would bring it out. I saw they do take credit cards using the \"square\" system I had seen before. Prices here are very reasonable but please note that certain ad ons carry a small upcharge and they are listed on the menu.  There is a small seating area in front and additional tables in the back room next to the gender neutral bathroom. I managed to snag one of those while reading a printed menu for me to take home. Since I noticed people with their laptops I learned they are still using the same WiFi network as Lil's. Pass code available upon request.  I got my sandwich and believe me it was very good and indeed filling. I'm glad I didn't get dessert. The huge vegan chocolate chip cookie and brownie next to it looked inviting but I refrained for now.   This place is not totally vegan. You can get regular menu items. I did inquire about gluten free items and was told they have them. Please note however, the printed menu says the following: \"While we offer gluten free bread we cannot guarantee that our food is safe for those with celiac disease. We will do our best to minimize cross contamination, but we use a shared grill and toaster.\" It goes on to say that you can check with a barista and they can suggest items that minimize cross contamination.  The coffee they use comes from a shop in Philadelphia. Although they have giant bags on the shelves they are not for sale. They hope to eventually sell some. Breakfast runs until 2 pm. If you would prefer lunch they offer various sandwiches, rice bowls, and salads.  The tiny cafe is located right in the heart of Polish Hill near Herron Ave. Street parking is available.  I hope to try a lunch item next time I visit."}
{"text":"THIS IS PURELY ABOUT WOLFTEETH DOUGHNUTS BECAUSE THEY ARE WORTH AN ALL CAPS ANNOUNCEMENT.   \"Oh great, another garbage vegan doughnut baker who probably just shoved an insane amount of sugar into their doughnuts.  Super.  Whatever, let's give it a whirl and expect nothing.\"  This was my thought process when I tried Wolfteeth doughnuts at the (now) Kaibur coffee (former Lilliput cafe) last year.   Then my soul was revived and dead black heart was resurrected a little bit.  I have had doughnuts from Seattle, to Brooklyn, to god damned Japan. WOLFTEETH TAKES THE DAMN CAKE ON BEST DOUGHNUTS PERIOD.  Vegan or not vegan. (Coming from an obnoxious vegan baker who is really stupidly snobby about vegan pastries, this is big.)  Yes Kaibur has food and coffee, but the doughnuts are where it's at.  Plus, doughnuts can clearly sustain life so nothing else matters.    If it happens to be a day without doughnuts at Kaibur, FEAR NOT, indulge in the best damn cinnamon roll I have ever shoved into my face.  Breakfast sandwiches, platters, rice bowls...this seemingly small coffee shop will knock your proverbial pants off with their treats."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for coffee and breakfast/lunch. The Kaibur Breakfast is one of the best breakfast dishes I've ever tried - so simple yet so good. Their pastries and deserts are fantastic! I also recommend the tempeh. Their food never disappoints. It's consistently great."}
