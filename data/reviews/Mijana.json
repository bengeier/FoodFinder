{"text":"Great food  Large portions  Fresh.   Pita bread is so outrageously good   Kind caring people."}
{"text":"I attended on a Sunday night to watch a belly dance performance. The restaurant was nearly empty, but based on Yelp reviews I ordered my food ASAP. I was seated quickly, but the wait for service was long, the appetizer took forever to come out, as did my wine and entree, but the food is delicious. The belly dancing was entertaining, and while the restaurant feels more banquet hall, than intimate dining, I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mediterranean fare. I had beef shawarma atop hummus, and my tablemates all had other varieties of shawarma with the rice deal. It was fine, not too burnt like is often found at places that serve the stuff. The house-made pita was nice, and we had their take on samosas (beef filled mini-pies) which were called something else but same thing; pretty tasty.  The atmosphere was nice and fitting, given the theme. Middle Eastern-style music, upholstery, et cetera. The only off-putting things that stop me from giving this place 4 stars are 1) the bathroom, which was composed of all very-old elements (toilet, sink) and was pretty gross. It's an old building, I understand, but y'know. Other thing was we were seated at a table which was directly next to an exit door. Pretty sure that's a fire hazard. My final gripe for this otherwise-okay place: They brought out my food by itself and thus my tablemates had to wait. This should be a cardinal sin in restaurants; if you had seen any of my other reviews, you'd know how annoying I find it as it's pretty unnecessary. I'll save you the rant, but just say if you start a restaurant please refrain from allowing that mess.  Other than that, all was fine. I guess I wouldn't recommend going here if you want to avoid the Scottsdale (read: hoity toity) crowd, as they're all up in this place, but they were at least drowned out by the music."}
{"text":"Overall the experience was not bad. I loved the belly dancer but the food lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet.  The food was very good.  The only reason it gets 4 and not 5 stars is because nothing was labeled on the buffet so it was kind of a mystery.  I could tell a few things like the hummus and baba ganoush but I was kind of guessing at the rest.  Still, great quality and very delicious!"}
{"text":"I'd never tried Lebanese food, so I was excited about this place.  I had a kebab sampler and it all seemed very Greek -- the pita, the hummus, the Taziki, etc. I felt it was a bit overpriced as well; and the belly dancing was a bit loud and annoying."}
{"text":"I'm bumping up to 5-star for the good food + unique factor.    Went for the lunch buffet - rich flavors, enjoyed tasting all the various spreads and dips, the cucumber salad with the crispy pieces of toasted pita was particularly good.  Thought the pudding offered a good closure.    Fresh baked pita bread; still inflated like a little balloon - light and tasty.  However, please label the food - education is part of the experience!"}
{"text":"This place had mediocre food and even worse service. The pita sandwich was pretty much just lettuce and tomato, and the side fries were soggy and unappetizing. The meat that came with the kabob and shawarma was dry and chewy. Fortunately, the fresh pita and hummus was delicious.  The service was extremely slow. We waited more than 20 minutes at a time just to order or ask for a check. The server kept forgetting our order and had to retake it multiple times."}
{"text":"The first half of the night gets a 5, the second half gets a 1...so all in all a 3.  My bf and I dined here last night, and I have very mixed feelings. The first half was great, the second not so much.  We got there early, around 5:45. There was only two other groups there and we were seated immediately. We planned to stick around for a couple hours to watch the show, so we tried a few appetizers. I have to say, it is hard to find a place that has good hummus and good falafel. It's usually one or the other. This place had the best I've ever had, and the pitas are delightfully fresh. We also had the baba ganoush, but that was not as blended as I usually like, there were still lots of seeds and it was a little slimy. Our first two rounds of Adios Amigos (adios motherf*ckers) were strong and yummy, just the way I like them.   Around 6:30 they started to get busier, as people were arriving for the show (second Sunday of the month is Bollywood style dancing). Another waitress came in but that was still only 2 servers for everyone. It took more that 20 minutes before we could flag down one of them so we could order our meals and another drink. The last drink, I'm pretty sure they made with double rum and no tequila. Blech! Once we got our food I was a little surprised because I didn't think stuffed zucchini would be a chilled dish. Turns out it's not, my food was just cold, and I don't mean room temp I mean fridge cold. She takes it make, microwaves it for about 30 seconds and brings it back.  My meal tasted like they took Uncle Ben's spanish rice and stuffed it in some zucchini. He had the beef shwarma, and said it was so-so.   The entertainment was great, and our waitress was very helpful before other people started showing up. We might go back another night for more appetizers and to see a show or we may try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time. Maybe if the food was outstanding I would overlook the horrific service and go back, but that wasn't the case here.  We were promptly seated in a two top table in between two others. The tables were so close together it was difficult to sit down and all guests could hear the intimate conversations everyone was having. There was a huge SPOTLIGHT on us and it was making us hot - when we asked the waiter to please dim the light or turn it away from us, he shrugged and said he would see what he could do, but nothing was done.   15 minutes go by without a followup. No water, no how do you do. Meanwhile a large party of people (obviously friends of the owners) were escorted past us into a secluded area from which spicy aromas wafted, teasing us as we sweat into our hummus, which had inexplicabley arrived.  Hummus was tasty, oily, could use more salt... The pillowy warm pita it came with was nice and chewy.  All this, and no water or drinks yet!  Honestly I can't remember what we ordered, most likely a combo dish, it was so unmemorable. What I do remember is that our appetizer came out after our entree, and the poor waiter seemed frazzled because he had too many tables assigned to him.   The owners/management didn't seem to care.  We would've felt sorry for the waiter and left him more than a 10% tip of he had done something about the Interrogation lighting and if he had bothered to ask us if we wanted drinks, or even silverware (I had to borrow from adjacent table).  This place seems more like a place for the owners and their family and friends to hang out than a place to go if you want quality service.    Nope."}
{"text":"Here's the quickie run down:  Lentil Soup - Amazing Hummous - Amazing Pita Bread - Baked onsite... Amazing Falafel - amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Kibbe - don't even usually like this.... amazing.    All this they made for me right before closing... they rock.   Can't comment on the service but when you see amazing lebanese food... you just gotta go no matter what.  Stop reading and start driving!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food!  Great service, they were able to accomodate our group of 20 with separate checks, and the belly dancer was amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice decor/traditional music, friendly staff.   Highly reccomend the group platters: large portions feeds more than it says (we ordered the mix grill for 4 but it was more than enough for 5). The tabouli and hummus were especially awesome. The rice was excellent.   Dessert was ok, wouldnt mind skipping this next time to eat more entree."}
{"text":"So I have ordered from this place twice now. Each time they have not sent what was in the description. Each time have not answered the phone when I called  to complain. I ordered the cheese and olives platter. They don't send olives they send me cucumber??? Come on? Some dishes I have had are good but most just come up lacking. Bland flavor. Lacking in spices. This place is a pass. I wish someone had told me that when you order from then don't expect to get what it says in the description. Maybe dine in is better but delivery is horrible."}
{"text":"The food is great, and if you come on Friday or Saturday around 7:30 they have a Bellydancer. The table beside us and we agreed that the food was great, but the service really sucked! Then we went over to the hookah lounge owned by the same people and waited an hour to have our hookah. By that time I was tired and has a few puffs, before going home to bed. I didn't want to tell them this was my birthday dinner, but they should treat the customer like every day's your birthday.  Apparently some staff are on spring break, so they apologized for keeping us waiting so long at the hookah lounge, and offered me a free hookah next time. So I might give them a change again."}
{"text":"Great place to take salsa dancing lessons! Very basic, fun and you don't even have to have a dance partner!"}
{"text":"Consistently my favorite authentic Lebanese restaurant in Phoenix area! Don't miss out on the good and ambiance, and an always welcoming host! The chicken kabobs and garlic spread are a must, tabbouli never disappoints and you should keep room for kennafeh. Honestly if you love Lebanese food,  you found the right place to get your fix!"}
{"text":"FILTH, FILTH, FILTH   My wife and I arrived at exactly 5pm on a Saturday.  That is the time they open for dinner.  We were the second customers to arrive.  My wife went to use the restroom, and she came out wanting to vomit.  She states there was urine all over the toilet seat, that had been there for weeks.  So she asks me to check out the men's restroom to see if it was in the same condition.  Sure enough, it was disgusting!  There was urine all over the urinal, urine all over the floor, it stunk like a backed up sewer, and most of all there was urine all in the sink with pubic hairs.  WTH!  My wife makes mention of their current restroom situation to our waitress.  The waitress tells who we assume is the owner/manager of the restaurant of the restrooms condition.  He then makes her (our waitress) clean the lady's restroom.  Then we see the gentleman who makes the pita bread, go and clean the men's restroom.  To top it all off! Our waitress when finished with cleaning the lady's restroom, proceeds to the kitchen area, and places the dirty towel, and cleaning formula, next to the coffee maker.  Some mild mentions.  The beverages taste horrible.  They taste like they come from unfiltered dirty tap water.  The beverages ordered were a diet coke, and an iced-t.  We asked for our bill, paid and left the restaurant.     Mijana!  You need to hire a cleaning crew!  To have filthy restrooms that look like they haven't been cleaned in weeks, is highly unacceptable.  I highly recommend a water filtration system for your beverages."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat and we found this spot. Owner was very welcoming, he came to introduce himself And ask us about the food and the ambiance(he's from Lebanon).   They have a buffet this month(i think it's for ramadan) - i shared some of the pictures.  The food is amazing! Delicious mix of spices and character. I tried: Lamb with rice, kobde, Hummus, Dessert (mhalabia)   The place has some music in the week-end.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Attended a Lebanese Cooking Class for Two.  Received Recipes for Hummus, Tabouli, Chicken Shawarma, Garlic Sauce, and  Baba Ghannouj.  Cooking demonstrations were given for each recipe, then an extremely generous portion was tried with homemade pita bread. Cooking class included a discussion on the health benefits of eating Mediterranean food.  Cooking class options available through Groupon.  Class included free drink and delicious homemade baklava.  Best hummus and baba ghannouj.  Try the cooking classes and you will leave with take home boxes of leftovers and a very satisfied feeling."}
{"text":"I went for happy hour. There is a sign in front of the restaurant that claims appetizers are 1/2 price. They charged full price. When I pointed this out, my waitress said, \"The sign is old.\" She then took $4 off the bill, meant that one of the three dishes I had as 1/2 priced. This is simply dishonest business.  This is sad because I liked my meal. The quail and ful medames were very good and the kibbe was also good. The basket of pita was hot and fresh. Up until I got my check, I was satisfied.  To be fair, the manager did throw a gift card at me on my way out. A nice, if hollow, gesture (even with the gift card, I still paid more than the advertised price). I won't go back to a place that promises one price, charges another, then uses lame excuses to cover up their dishonesty. This wasn't just one bad waiter, the entire staff was dishonest."}
{"text":"I had heard that Mijana serves labneh, and so I decided to wander in...especially since I haven't been able to find labneh since I moved to the valley almost 4 years ago! They used to carry it at Trader Joe's but for some reason they stopped. Anyhow, I was unable to actually have a sit down experience but I stopped in and picked up a carry out.   The restaurant itself is well equipped for entertainment, and it sounds like they have nightly events. My server was very friendly, and I was able to get my carry out quickly. I waited at the bar for a moment while they were putting the carry out together, and witnessed a discussion between the young bartender and two customers. The customers wanted a Crown Manhattan, and suffice it to say, the bartender did not display great knowledge of bartending.   I definately hope to go back to Mijana and have  a full experience, their menu appears to be quite authentic and im always a fan of live entertainment."}
{"text":"I moved to Arizona 2 years ago and finally I found Mijana best Lebanese food ever in Arizona I go over there 3 times a week,I love it."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had in a restaurant  My wife and I used an Amazon local voucher and we were very disappointed. It took over 2 hours to get our food. People came and went and the server kept coming over and apologizing but nothing happened.  I finally complained and asked for it to go and when I opened the package at home I was extremely disappointed. This is the first bad review I have ever written about a restaurant. Don't use a coupon or voucher they will treat you second class."}
{"text":"A friend invited me..she had a flyer for belly dancing lessons at 6pm .we met up there at 630.. And there was only the hostess /waitress/bartender and a couple other employees standing around .we sat and ordered a drink and hummus .waiting for the dancers ,and slowly after 7 they walked in. I met one Rosa very nice .she invited me to her studio on 7st and camelback.so the show consist of r&b ,reggae ton and country it was fun but I would have loved to see and hear middle eastern music. All and all I was entertained. The lamb kebobs were ok and beside me searching for are hostess at the bar. She was great."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and attentive but not overbearing. Food was very authentic Lebanese, we lived in Arabia and traveled the area so are quite familiar with the food. Sish tawak and kafta kabobs were excellent. They make their own pita to order so is fresh and hot out of the oven. We will make the trip to the East valley again for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough.  They Bake pita bread for you on the spot and their dolmades are the best I've ever had by a long shot.  When I went in there was no one else in the resteraunt which concerned me at first but it must just not have ben discovered by very many people.  The staff was extremely pleasant and every part of my meal was delicious.  For those of you who don't know what lebanese food is or what it entails it's not super wild ethnic food that will keep you glued to the toilette its kabobs, hummus, things like that.  I am not a particularly adventurous eater and I loved everything I tried.  So I say try something new and you wont regret it.  Recomend: dolmades,  kofta kabob"}
{"text":"Very good food and generous portion, will come back again. The young lady who helped me with the order was super friendly, and they gave me 6 pita bread for togo, which is very generous."}
{"text":"We tried Mijana first because the Middle Eastern man working at the Honda dealership where we bought our Fit said it was the best Middle Eastern restaurant in Phoenix and he'd tried them all. When we saw the Groupon coupon offer, pay $15 for a $30 coupon, we jumped. Cost of gasoline for the round trip from Apache Junction was $8 that we included in our expenses.   Though the online menu said that there were two for one drinks and half-off cold appetizers during 5-7 pm Happy Hour M-F, that had been eliminated, along with the buffet I'd hoped to try from reading Yelp reviews. So that dented our budget from the start.   I'd decided on the lamb shank from the online menu, largely because it said there was a hamburger sauce for the rice, and every Greek and Middle Eastern restaurant where I've had lamb shank, the tomato-based meaty sauce, often with peas, carrots and onions, is the best part of the dish. No sauce of any kind. I asked the waitress, who checked the menu and saw it said a hamburger sauce, and she went to the cook to get some.   He told her that customers didn't like it so they discontinued the sauce. The menus should be updated to delete references to Happy Hour deals and the sauce. The smallish lamb shank was fine but average without a sauce. Rice was very good--moist and well seasoned. Accompanying salad on the plate had a yogurt and cucumber cup of dressing on the side, pretty bland.   The babba ghanouj appetizer at $7 was excellent and plentiful, and the freshly baked pita bread is outstanding while warm. The wait staff were pleasant and quick to respond, and the owner or manager came over to personally check on our satisfaction.   We were the only customers there at 5 pm when they opened, and by 7 when the belly dancer show was to start, there were two other tables of 2 and 4, and two tables of 14 or so that seemed to be of students and perhaps university staff. They seemed enthusiastic about what was to come, and they were eating heartily and having a great time.   So it was perhaps us, and our expectations of Lebanese food that we've enjoyed elsewhere through the past 50 years, including the Middle Eastern food at Haji Baba's nearby, a small restaurant tucked inside a grocery market. That remains our Middle Eastern favorite in the Phoenix area. Pita Jungle is pretty good, as we remember.   We'll still be on the lookout for new Middle Eastern restaurants, hopefully with the sauces and tastes we've enjoyed through the years. Good service, other than the waitress bringing my partner's Greek salad entrée a good ten minutes before my lamb shank came out.   I'm sure Mijana's is a swinging place once the dancing starts! Total bill, with only the one Margarita and one appetizer and no other drinks or desserts, including tax and tip, was $56. So we paid $41 plus $8 in gasoline. Remember, the pita, rice, and babba ghanouj are outstanding. Three stars overall."}
{"text":"If you crave Mediterranean food and happen to be in the area I recommend it. However I didn't like the venue. As for the food, the hummus had this strange peanut taste but the falafel was okay. Babaganoush was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS!! Best middle eastern/Mediterranean food I've EVER had (and I'm from NY where there are plenty of Lebanese people/restaurants and known for good food). This place is a gem. Will 100% return here soon. I seriously can't get over how good everything was. It was as fresh as it gets we saw the bread coming out of the oven and delivered right to the table. Get the Lebne appetizer and use the zaatyr (spelling??) with the pita, it's heavenly!! I got the Greek salad with gyro meat I can't tell you how unbelievable it was!! Everything was perfect and the waitress was attentive and friendly. Can't say enough about this place can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Mijana several years ago, and the experience was alright. Not particularly memorable, but not bad. We tried to give it a change again a few weeks ago, as it is located in a very convenient area for my family, but the experience was cut short...  We were seated and then ignored, despite the fact that there were only two or three other full tables in the whole restaurant. The waitress was friendly, but kept small talking to some people at another table while we waited perhaps 15 or so minutes to order. It looked like there was only one person in the kitchen, so we decided that it probably wasn't worth it.   It was slightly awkward, but we just got up and walked out! First time I have done that in my life. We ended up going to Princess Market and Cafe, which is much farther from us but about a third of the price. It is a nice, fancy looking place, but has expensive prices and poor service. Unfortunately, we won't be returning!"}
{"text":"We dined here last Saturday night. When we arrived there were a few people in the restaurant, but the restaurant filled up in the 45 minutes or so we waited for our dinner.  A few people who came in after we had ordered received their food at least 10 minutes before us.  Our waiter was not seen again except to bring our bill.   I do think $16 for a gyro plate, that consisted of half a plate of rice, lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, some slices of beet,1/8 of a pickle, and six slices of gyro meat is too much. I've had more fulfilling meals at George's Gyros - for half the cost.   Skip this place and head north to the Persian Room. More of a drive, but a far better experience for about the same money."}
{"text":"What a shame for  the beautiful Arabic word \" Mijana\" to be used as a name  for the most disgusting  food and Entertainment Establishment I have ever seen and experienced through out my Life, which made me  ashamed  of my Lebanese heritage for the first time ever. That was when I took my none Arab fiancé and her family to this place in Tempe, after checking out their web side, describing how good and authentic the food is \"The meat will melt in your mouth\" , how friendly and jenurose   the management and the staff are  and how reasonable the prices are, which made me believe all the sweet talk on the web side. But when we got their every thing was the opposite of what the website and the made-up and fake reviews  on it,  states ...there was no one at the door to greed the customers , so we start wondering around where to sit... after ten  minutes some young lady took us to where she  made us sit and left without saying a word, After repeated attempt of  me to get  server's attention, finally he  came and talked to us,  so I asked him for the menu , he told me we have only a set menu, so I asked him but, can we see what is in it? And what the prices are? He told me you will know when we bring the food and the check. I was shocked but I kept it quite,   all this was in \"Arabic\".   we ordered drinks, then an hour later they brought us the food that from just looking at it, I realized that was at least few days old and reheated in the Microwave including the meat that did not melt in no once mouth, instead it got stuck in my thought and the portion they brought for six people, I could have ate it by my self if it was decent, Instead none of us touched it after the first terrible bite.. People there is not enough words to describe how bad the food was,  how rood  the staff were Including the Owner, how loud the music was, how outrages' the prices were , how lousy the entire  experience was and how  ashamed I was to take my fiancé and her family to this shameful place . Please, do yourself a favor  do not believe the reviews on there web site, they are made up.  \"NOT REAL\" and avoid this place...It is Nasty... And to those who have been to this place already please understand this is not what Lebanese culture stands for.!!!!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Homemade Pita bread is delicious and left me with high expectations for the rest of the food which left something to be desired. I have been twice, once with a large group and once it was just me and my woman.   The service: When I came with the large group the food service was poor as plates came out at various times with about an hour gap amongst people who ordered at the same time. When it was just two of us, everything as ok.  The food:  Have had two vegetarian plates the moussaka and the couscous and both were overpriced for the quality of the food. Vegetables were definitely out of a can and was something I could have made at home for about $1.50, which is unacceptable for a 12 dollar veggie meal. It is not that expensive to grill up some fresh vegetables and increases the quality of the meal substantially. Also had the lentil soup, which was tasty and not bad for $5, but it might have been from a can as well, just harder to tell with a soup.. You are likely not going to get what you pay for in food quality but the atmosphere is nice. If you are looking for some good flavorful ethnic food try GOJO Ethiopian on Thomas, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! On Friday nights they have a live belly dancer and later they do Salsa lessons. Super fun and very friendly waitstaff"}
{"text":"I had the fatoosh salad with chicken shawarma.  The dressing was way too acidic. That was not as bad as the chicken shawarma which was hopelessly dry and tasteless. My partner had the couscous with veggies. The veggies tasted like it came from a can and nuked.  We also ordered baba ganoush and everyone called it oatmeal.  I don't plan to go back again."}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if I could!  My friend and I decided we wanted to try out a new place for dinner on a Saturday night before heading out to Old town Scottsdale. SO HAPPY we chose this place!  Staff- Extremely friendly! I loved how everyone worked together as a team. Our server was so helpful and took the time to describe the menu to us. She gave us really good recommendations because everything we ordered was really food. The owner was incredibly nice and checked up on us to make sure everything was good.   Food- DELICIOUS!!! We ordered a platter that gave us a variety of different things and everything was so good, It was also a perfect portion for 2 people! I really wish I had room for dessert  because it all looked so good.   Atmosphere- It is such a pretty restaurant, we sat on the patio because the weather was perfect! We sat inside for a bit to watch a belly dancing performance while we waited for our food. Our server told us she would come look for us to tell us when our food was ready so it wouldn't get cold (such a sweetheart)   My friend and I were only supposed to grab a bite to eat and head to Scottsdale around 10pm, and we didn't leave the restaurant until midnight because we were having so much fun!! We also hung out at the Hookah lounge right next door and ended up making some awesome friends by the end of the night.  Mijana, I will be seeing you soon! :) I recommend it to anyone who is wanting to try something new."}
{"text":"Ordered some food home today.. Got the mijana meza which is a quite a combo of the appetizers.. It was okay for me served with 3 sauces..hummus I felt it was a lil bitter  but the others were good...what I really liked was the desert knafeh I don't like it too sweet so it was perfect for me.the 3 stars actually goes for the desert!!!! All in all not bad but will have to try a diff one next time.."}
{"text":"First time here and Groupon brought me in. Very flavorful food and very kind, nice server. The owner even came out to ask if everything was ok, which is always a nice thing to do. Plus, belly dancing entertainment! What a fun Saturday evening spent! P.S. Hummus, freshly baked pita bread and shawarma were fabulous!"}
{"text":"We normally eat at the restaurant, so this was our 1st catering experience at Mijana. We ordered dinner for 120 people. Manesa, the owner, helped make the process so easy. He made food recommendations & accommodated our vegetarian guests by making special dishes not on the menu. Then the day of party, he called early in the day to confirm the order. His son, Trevor, arrived on time and delivered all the food. He set everything on the table. The food was brought in foil pans, so he left some serving platters in case we wanted to use them instead of the pans. He also included serving spoons & tongs. Trevor was so professional & made sure everything was exactly as I wanted before leaving.  Our guests kept asking where we ordered from. Everyone absolutely loved the food!!! They were so excited to know we have a restaurant in town that makes authentic middle eastern food. Lots of our guests went back for seconds and we still had enough leftovers to feed another 50 people! Manesa is very generous with his portions. Mijana is definitely my #1 goto from now on!! Thanks Manesa & Trevor!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a Groupon and now I can't get enough! I love Mediterranean food, and everything here is delicious. It is a little expensive without the Groupon, but the servings are huge! My favorite is the baba ganoush and the lamb kebabs with garlic sauce. I also went to a cooking class, which was more a demonstration, but they gave us a lot of recipes so we could try making hummus and other dishes at home. And they made a ton of food, so it was basically a show and a meal! I go here every few months and it does not disappoint."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Have been here many times with my family and have taken friends here as well. It's always tasty and huge portions for decent prices. They have a nice atmosphere and our 4 year has fun dancing when we dine here."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon for this visit and we definitely got our monies worth.  Service was excellent! The manager stopped by our table a few times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Food was delicious and came out in a timely manner.  Hummas was smooth and the pita bread was hot and puffy! Beef schwarma was incredible!!  We bought Baklava and another dessert to go. The other dessert has 4 cheese layers and a sweet syrup on top. Very good but burnt on the top.  Only 4 stars because there was no belly dancing as stated on their website. Manager and waitress could not explain why either.  We will be coming back and hopefully get to experience the belly dancing."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Mijana a few times. Saturday was clearly the worst. Only got service after we stopped a server and asked for service. Not enough staff. They must have a new cook because the plating was very sloppy and the chicken was undercooked in the mixed grill. Hope they get it straightened out."}
{"text":"They serve really large portions. The service is amazing, the waitress was very attentive. We had the mix grill for four, hummus, and kibbe and there was so much food we had to take some home. I highly recommend this amazing restaurant. On the weekends they have salsa dancing."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident as we were looking for a place to smoke hookah on Labor Day.  We walked into the adjacent hookah lounge, and found it to be cozy with large couches and charming Middle Eastern decor.  The staff was very friendly, and the bartender walked over from the restaurant and changed the TV channel from Middle Eastern pop to the football game for us.  My boyfriend was ecstatic to find that they serve kennafeh-- the only place in the Valley we've found so far!  It was very good, as was the double apple hookah.  The prices are definitely ok considering the ambiance, but we were a little surprised by the $3 charge for bottled water.      A bit later, the bartender walked over and invited us to the restaurant to view the belly dancers.  The belly dancers and the crowd certainly set the atmosphere for the restaurant to be fun and entertaining.  The bar was fully stocked with liquor, but I was slightly disappointed with their beer selection.      We went in for dinner a few days later, and were welcomed by a very friendly waitress and pita bread with olive oil to start.  I ordered the beef shwarma, which was awesome.  The spices were perfectly infused without being overwhelming.  I was most impressed by the side salad (always a vegetarian at heart), which was comprised of very fresh vegetables and dressed with amazing Italian vinaigrette.  My boyfriend ordered the stuffed grape leaves, which were also very yummy.      We finished the night on the patio with some pomegranate hookah, which I highly recommend.  The flavor was rich and didn't sting.      Overall, I highly recommend this place, whether you're looking for a quiet evening with amazing Lebanese food and hookah, or for a party with belly dancers or salsa lessons."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Beef and chicken Shawna, salads, hummus, Turkish coffees and great desserts. The door says happy hour menu but the owner said not today maybe next week? Kinda strange. Turkish coffee rings up higher than the listed price."}
{"text":"Uneven. Beirut mezza plate was yummy. Their pita is fresh baked and the best I've ever had. The lamb shank was exquisite. HOWEVER....The Chicken Biryani was terrible. TERRIBLE! Frozen mixed vegetables with diced chicken over rice. And no flavor. Service was marginal. Ran out of ice tea @ 6:30 on a Saturday night. Waited for everything. Might have had a cocktail had we not waited so long after being seated."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, live belly dancing. Fresh ingredients and spices in all the dishes that explode in your mouth. Yummie!"}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING!!!! THE ATMOSPHERE WAS GREAT! They have belly dancer that comes on about 730 on weekends which is a plus. Great for sharing for two, it was 65. The belly dancer was covered which was odd and the waitress wasn't that attentive but still had a great time!"}
{"text":"I went there recently for an event that had over 130 people.  The event leader said she had told the owner far in advance of the event and of the amount of people.    The service was predictably slow, but I mean reaaaaaallllllyyyyyy slow.  They only had 2 servers, yes 2.  We had to get up and get the server, get our own water and drinks at the bar they were so overwhelmed.  This is OK at an Arbys, but not at a restaurant.    My rating isn't for the servers, they did their best to keep up, my rating is for the owner who really didn't care."}
{"text":"The food is very good. I ordered the lamb shank, and the meat was falling off the bone. The taste was a bit bland, but the rice underneath it was very tasty. They confused our reservation time, wrote it as 6 p.m., when it was actually confirmed as 6:30 p.m. They also tried to seat us at two tables rather than the long table in the center, because they thought we were a reservation of 6 rather than the confirmed reservation of 13. They also confused my order and gave me a yogurt cucumber salad, even though I ordered the cucumber tomato. They told us that they were expecting a wedding party at 8 p.m., and wanted us to vacate the table by then, which we politely did, but it did anger me. I'm not accustomed to being pushed around and hurried out of a restaurant. My family owns restaurants, and we do not treat people so rudely. They need to become better organized and need better customer service. We left at about 8:10 and the wedding party had yet to arrive!"}
{"text":"Order delivery tonight and my food arrived within 25 min. That's very quick for a Saturday night. The chicken shawarma and hummus was AMAZING. The spices and and flavor were perfect with the hummus.  The beef quesadilla was a wonderful addition! I WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Rude owner. Rude son. Nothing fresh on      this visit.  They serve you rubbish .and if you don't smile to rubbish.and appreciate it. They will get an attitude with you.      Not worth it. When Tempe is only mins away . With some beautiful options.    Hajji Baba. Coffee istanbul .Phoenician coffee.hummus express  and so many others Delicious option .      We end up here paying $51 for hummus.  And one oz of some chicken   with no taste of texture on top  .and a fish cod dish that my  old cat will have a hard time digesting.         Pass this one ladies and gentlemen. It is not worth the money .and the attitude is sky high.      Owner and son . Need not to ask how is the food. If they can't handle the truth ."}
{"text":"Offers in their websites in no longer valid! But they keep it to drag you in! Server is bad. Management need to do a lot of changes if they wanna keep the business up."}
{"text":"Really good food, and fun entertainment. Service is a bit slow, but seriously. Just relax and enjoy. We're not in a hurry, right?"}
{"text":"I walked in on a Sunday night with a family member when there was practically no one. We were seated to a table within a timely manner. As I was skimming the menu, there was a middle-aged cook staring me down almost as if I had committed something immoral. It made me feel extremely uncomfortable. To get my mind off this man, I took a look around the restaurant, only to realize that the decor was absolutely dreadful. Boxes from their dance nights were piled up on the side and forgotten about. In addition, the paint on the walls didn't match the environment they were trying to evoke.   Nonetheless, after the two of us looked over the menu, we decided to go with bowl of hummus and their mixed grill for two. As we were waiting for the hummus, we received naan bread and some sort of dipping sauce with sesame seed and olive oil. The sauce was loaded with so much seasoning that I thought I was going to go into some sort of cardiac arrest. I waited for the hummus to dip my bread in, only for the hummus to taste as if it was store-bought. Shortly after, the mixed grill arrived, and it contained overcooked meat that had low-quality vinaigrette spread all over it.   If it weren't for my Groupon for $21 off, this meal would have totaled to over $70 (including the tip). If you want to feed yourself and one other person, I can think of a long list of restaurants that will serve you a better quality meal for half of this price. I was really let down from going to Mijana. Hopefully they turn something around soon, because their shirts that say \"Rated #1 by Phoenix New Times\" are completely redundant."}
{"text":"First time here. The food was really good! We had shawarma, hummus, salad. Service was good and we received our food quickly. They have coupons on Groupon and Restaurant.com and they let you use them on a Friday night. The place is big with a stage for live entertainment. At 7:30 on Fridays they perform belly dancing. Very cool to watch. Our only complaint was the music during the performance was pretty loud. We really liked this place and will go back."}
{"text":"I'm Lebanese and I haven't experienced any real or authentic lebanese restaurants in Arizona until I dined here tonight. We were a party of 4, as soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted by one of the employees who sat us outside. My friends and i decided to go mezza style and order a variety of things. We ordered the lebanese trio, grape leaves, kibbe, bourak, soujouk, and chicken tawook. Everything was delicious, we had also ordered a lemon and mint argileh that tasted good and didnt burn right away like most argilehs tend to do. As a matter of fact the argileh didn't burn at all! We all had a wonderful experience and had the honor of conversing with the owner who was very kind and welcoming. Definitely will come back again because I live in sedona. It's worth the drive!! Thank you for the great experience and making me feel like I was eating REAL lebanese food."}
{"text":"Great food! Great value with the Groupon. Our party of four shared the mixed grill for four and two kanafes. Everything was very tasty and prepared to perfection. Service was prompt and professional. The music and ambiance was awesome. This was my second time here and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Mijana a number of times and they all have been great experiences! I have grown up with my mom's home cooked Lebanese dishes my whole life and this food was still great! The appetizer sampler was excellent, as was the chicken shawarma plate my father ordered. An added bonus was the Al Maza beer (Lebanese beer) my father and I ordered! Great atmosphere for dinner, with music and a belly dancer."}
{"text":"My friend took me out here and we had both heard some good things about it. At the end of the night, he was apologizing to me for how awful the food and service was. We're both Middle Eastern and about the only thing we liked about this place is the atmosphere, which is the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars, I'm being generous! The Food was too expensive, and we had to flag down what seemed to be the only waiter there twice to get our food after waiting over 45 minutes. The food tasted awful and old. Tasted like it was just thawed out and cooked which made it really dry. The entertainment; the belly dancer looked tired and danced like it was a chore that she couldn't wait to finish and only went to tables where most of the drunk guys who were throwing the money at her. Music was way too loud so we had to scream at each other. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"Let me start with I Love Mediterranean food!!   This place has amazing fresh food with entertainment.  They have a belly dancer that dances while you eat and randomly select people to join them dance.  Lol. Really fun to watch. Love their chicken shawarma with rice, hummus, salads, pita breads etc."}
{"text":"My first dinner experience with Mijana was not the best and I probably won't be going back to try any other dishes.   When I walked in, the place had an odd mild chemical smell that I couldn't recognize. Not bad enough to make me leave, but it definitely didn't smell appetizing. My server brought me ice water and complimentary pita bread with zaatar.  I ordered the lamb kabob which came with rice, a small side salad, several pickle spears, and some yogurt. My disappointment began with the salad, which consisted of tomatoes, cucumbers, and romaine lettuce.The tomatoes in the salad had a slightly mushy texture, like they'd been refrigerated for too long. There is no excuse for mushy tomatoes ever, but especially during the summer months. I tried the rice which was saffron colored and decorated with a few strands of chopped noodles. The rice was unremarkable and tasted like it had been parboiled. The lamb had flavor, but was extremely tough. Even after cutting the lamb into tiny pieces, it was embarrassingly difficult to chew.   My bill came to $17 and change. I gave my waitress $20, and she never brought me my change. To be fair, she might have brought my change at some point, but it was clearly not her priority as she ran around doing other things.   No complaints about the belly dancer."}
{"text":"Love this place. Reminds me of home. Great ambiance can't wait to come back for the belly dance show."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon coupon for this place and we went last week for dinner. From the appetizers we ordered chicken wings which is blunt and over fired. I was disappointed but the chicken shawarma is pretty good and thus we continued our order. We also tried chicken kebob from the grill. This is not a big portion but sufficient.I have tried the kabob from many places and this is ok in taste.  Thier place is good for parties and the staff are prompt."}
{"text":"The food is here is heavenly. I'm head over heels for their garlic lebneh. Ordered a mezza spread with my mother and we left more than happy. Great atmosphere and very nice staff."}
{"text":"We dropped by here for lunch because of the groupon deal they were offering. Nothing special, really. The pita bread is great, but my shawarma platter  was 'meh'.   The waitress took forever and then screwed up out bill, had to call her manager, etc, so basically that groupon deal cost us 20 minutes.   Otherwise, its decent and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've dined here with my family several times.  The food is plentiful and delicious.  Love watching the belly dancers on Friday and Saturday nights, they really make the whole experience a delight!  Portions are huge, love the fatoush, but one order can feed three, lol. The beef kabobs were a delight, however we asked for them to be rare, and they were medium at best.  The rice was wonderful and the pita bread is to die for!  Hummus is great as is the baba ganoush  Kenefe is our dessert of choice and it's wonderful, perfect ending to a meal there.  My only real complaint is the service is on the slow side, but if you're not in a hurry all is well.."}
{"text":"Great food, service was ok at best. The food totally out weighs the lack of service. Chicken kabob was done perfectly, falafel was crisp on the outside moist in the middle. Large room no need to wait. Don't pass up a chance for authentic lebonese food."}
{"text":"Craving Arab food tonight amd this was the closest to my hotel. Beautiful inside, love the decor. Table cloths , cloth red napkins, dim lighting. They played traditional music, not too loud or overpowering. Full bar. Next door to a hookah lounge which is nice. Friendly service. The food was yumm. Over all, I would return."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I've NEVER had quail before, so I really don't know what's \"good\" or \"bad\" for quail but this quail was absolutely AMAZING.  The humus was great too.  As I ordered delivery and had to spend quite a bit to cover the minimum amount for delivery I also bought the Mixed grill.  I intended to eat half of each but I devoured the quail so quickly I ended up only sampling the kebab just so I'd know how it tasted (Saved it for the next day, but kebab is never as good the next day) and it was equally amazing.  The lamb tasted just a tad tough, but it could have just been because it had time to cool during the delivery.  Will definitely order again, however maybe next time I'll dine in.  This kind of food really does need to be eaten fresh off the grill."}
{"text":"This restaurant was so good. If people knew how good it was they would be packed. The food was fresh and tasted amazing. Groupon totally worth it."}
{"text":"The restaurant was not to capacity or anything when we went last night. It had a great little vibe  to it.  Was greeted promptly at the door by what I believe to be the owner. He was very nice checked on us several times.  It was dinner for 2 just me and my husband ordered the magnum Mijana  for 2. Excellent food and service.  We had a group on and were not treated any differently at all. There is only one waitress Jessie I believe was her name. She offered great service and ran around the restaurant and the bar area very efficiently. All around great night out. ."}
{"text":"We had a uye buffet lunch here today with Rand h, Norm R and Robyn N. and i can not think of to many other Lebanese restaurant to compare it to but I wish there was because even though I did not know a lot of the dishes I was eating I really enjoyed everything I tried. I look forward to going back on a different day to try some more of this delicious cuisine. So if your in the mood to try something a little different I would recommend  Mijana because YAY I am a fan."}
{"text":"The worst place and the worst service ever we ordered ice tea to start than we got coke than after asking over ten times for the tea we has to go get it. Then we asked for coffee that never showed... Again we got it ourselves and the cream was bad. Than hummace came out with no bread we had to get that. the food was horrible not as good as two years ago. i was embarrassed to even come here with my family. My father inlaw has a hard time walking he had to use a walker to walk in and out while trying to get out he was leaning against one of the outside tables because of some people coming through while his doing that the table broke off and he fell I had to call my brother to help me get him up not even the owner or anything even managed to come out to say sorry or anything!! This is such a rude place with rude employees who don't care about their job, they only do it while they have to while cussing at customers like one of the girls telling my wife f*** because she messed her drink up. DO NOT EVER COME HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Great Lebanese food and I would know because I'm Lebanese myself. What impressed me the most was that the food def. had a \"home-like\" flavor to it. We also got a great portion for the price we paid. Ordered the \"mixed grill for four\" which costs $56! At first I had doubts it would feed that many people because most places are stingy with their portions and I usually eat a lot, but Mijana def. gave us out money's worth. The mixed grill for four actually fed 5 of is and we had a little leftover. The food was very fresh and grilled to perfection. The atmosphere was very nice and they played traditional Arabic music. The service was good; our waitress was very nice but a little slow at times. Overall I would def. recommended mijana as a great restaurant to try traditional middle eastern food. Oh, we also purchased a restaurant.com gift card  for our visit which made it even more worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, Great Atmosphere. I love going on Friday's for the Salsa dancing and drink !"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Some of the best Lebanese food I've had. The kenafe was a welcome sight on the menu, though it wasn't the best kenafe I've ever tasted. The service, however, was slow. My server barely looked at me. Didn't smile. But the food made up for it, without a doubt."}
{"text":"I went to have dinner with our colleagues - a party of 5. This place was recommended by the holiday inn where we were staying. The dining room is spacious and nice ambiance. You can see berry dance show on weekend.  We ordered cheese plate, stuffed zucchini, tabbouleh salad, lamb chops, grilled meat dishes. I thought the volume was large, all of the food tested good.  Food: good Service: good Price: great Ambiance: great"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out since they offered the yelp check-in deal. The pita bread & dip they brought out before our meal was a tasty start. The waitress was pleasant & came out with drinks. I ordered the chicken shwarma platter as it was recommended to us. The chicken was really tasty & well-cooked and the rice wasn't too bad. Personally, I could've done without the salad. The waitress again came by and brought out a platter with dessert options. We ordered one which took way too long to come out and wasn't anything to rave about. Overall, it was an ok meal."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out but the first time i went i got charged 4$ over from what showed on the receipt which i knew abt when i checked my bank statement but it wasn't worth the phone call. The second time they charged me 30$(10$ each person) over the bill because they had a singer and they did not mention the cover charge when we entered , and yeah whether u like it or not tips are mandatory and will be on the receipt ( in my case 12$ for 2 meals), so i ended up paying 81$ instead of 30$ for 2 meals. We had fun that night but it would've been nice if they mentioned the cover charge before we got seated."}
{"text":"I got takeout and I didn't even feel a slight tinge of homesickness or memories evoked by this place's food.  Amazingly nice staff, fabulous service (they offered  me a drink while I waited and could not have been more courteous).  However, what Arab salad doesn't have the crispy bread pieces?  Why was my lamb tough?  Where did you get this super thick pita bread?  Who taught you to make hummus?  Save your money and go to Pita Jungle instead--other than hearing Arabic, I felt it was just as authentic as the cheaper option.  In fact, I'd go here if there weren't several other \"pita jungle' type options in the area.  PRO: they had the right pickles.  That counts for a lot.  If you want to hang out and smoke shisha, this is definitely your place."}
{"text":"I'm excited for leftovers tonight! - Backstory: My fiance loves Lebanese cuisine, I've never had it before (in the true sense) -   I happened upon a Groupon and figured we would try it.  Any doubt I had I am kicking myself for.  First, the atmosphere is wonderful and our server was super friendly as were the other employees we encountered when we were leaving.  We ordered the beirut mezza, a beef kabob and a kofta kabob.  Again, cannot wait for leftovers tonight - the beirut mezza was a great sample of wonderful, flavorful items; the babaghonouj was the standout if I had to pick an item off of the plate. AMAZING. The kabobs were wonderful and served with a side of rice that was prefect as it wasn't overly seasoned and a fresh salad of cucumbers and tomatoes.  Again, wonderful.  As we were eating we were planning our next visit and decided we definitely need to bring a group of friends, the amount of food you get (and for a great price) is great for sharing with a table so you can sample different things.  Mijana is now on our go-to list for dinners out."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night and it was completely empty, gave off a real pity vibe. A cool touch was seeing the baker working his pita oven.    Probably the best Pita, Zaatar and Baba ghanoush I've ever had which saved this from a 2 star review. Unfortunately, the main dishes were just meh and a bit overpriced. I recently moved from Glendale CA where Raffi's set the bar for grilled dishes.  I'll keep trying other places in the valley, but if I have a craving for Baba ghanoush I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had a Combo and used a Groupon. Only a view People there in the Restaurant. The Service was not so friendly, we didnt felt welcome. The Food was okay, but not more. We had to wait long to do our payment.  With a little more kindness and better Service it could be a good place."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon and decided it was time to use it before it expired.  Besides, the hubs and I had just returned from vacay and looking forward to some mid-Eastern comfort food.  We arrived about 6 pm on  a Friday night and the place was pretty much empty. Too early for belly-dancing so not many customers but it did fill up a bit by the time we left.   Service - okay, you know that is always a beef with me. Bad food is attributable to a bad night for the chef but bad service is management not taking time to educate their staff.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. It was just kind of okay. We did watch our meals get set down at another table but they never touched them so it was easy to get them back.  We started with an order of Borek. I have always had it made pie-style but this was rolled cigar-style.  Very hot and fresh, nice mixed, crispy, not oily. I never had a mix of mozzarella and feta but it was tasty. Four to an order for $7.95.  A bit pricey I think, especially with them being cut with mozzarella.  They bring you an order of fresh bread with za-atar mixed with olive oil.  I enjoy za-atar on cheesy pita or on yogurt, but this just didn't do anything for me. On top of it, while the bread was freshly baked, it was very flat in flavor, as though they left the salt out.  Dinners come with side salad and rice.  DH ordered Chicken Shawarma and I order Lamb Kebab.  Start with salad. It is a simple salad (lettuce, cukes, tomatoes) with a dressing and a side of turnips and pickles.  Nice size for a side salad. It wasn't a bad salad although I would have liked to have some of the dry za-atar mixed into the dressing to add a little pizazz to it.  But here is the thing that really got to me. I am ordering an $18 dinner.  Please bring my salad out on a separate plate so it is cold and doesn't have hot meat and rice warming it up.  I get that it fills the plate up but, seriously, I now either need to eat my salad first (which I did so everything else was cold till I got to it) or eat the hot stuff first and let it wilt more. Dilemma, dilemma. DH tried to eat them at the same time and wound up with everything just lukewarm - salad, rice, and meat.  His Chicken Shawarma was nicely spiced and piled on top of the rice.  Good size portion.  The lamb perhaps was not so spectacular. I am not sure why mid-Eastern restaurants in Phoenix insist on cooking lamb till it is well done, no matter what you ask for but they do. They insist they cannot serve it any other way - and yet they offer raw kibbee.  Go figure.  Anyway, it was spiced with allspice as expected - a little different from what I am used to from other Lebanese restaurants.  Honestly - it was dry and tough.  If they used a shoulder, it might be a little tougher so maybe they didn't use leg of lamb.  would be a shame to waste a leg by overcooking it.  The last part of the meal was the rice. Every mid-Eastern restaurant has its own trademark rice - chicken broth, pignolia nuts, almonds,  raisins, maybe some herbs, maybe plain rice or maybe basmati, etc.  I can only liken this rice to Rice-a-Roni without the spice packet. There was no discernible flavor. No spice. It was just yellow.  That's all i can say about it, it was not remarkable at all.  Borek, two dinners, and two sodas - $48 plus tip before Groupon.  All in all, it was okay. I think that I have found more flavorful alternatives here in the Valley - although they do have a larger menu than many places."}
{"text":"This place has great customer service!!  I can't wait to come back and experience the Arabic singing and dancing on weekends."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food has always been consistent and good.  I had the kibbie for lunch and it was cooked perfectly. Everything had good flavor and the service was also good.  A good place to eat if your in the mood for Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"So good on so many levels. I got a nice plate with about everything for a little over $15. It was worth it. I am in town alone but wish I had others to share how good this food and atmosphere is.  The place is traditional Lebanese. Owner is and runs it well."}
{"text":"Let's see.  I came here because of a groupon.  I saw good reviews and therefore decided why not.  I asked for a wine and it took about 20 minutes to get it.  We ordered food and I got mine at least 10 minutes before anyone else at my table (3).   Their chicken shwarma was WAY overcooked.  The service was awful.  Their only saving grace was the bread, but the fact that there was no soap in the ladies room tells me someone isn't washing their hands before returning to work.  So there's that."}
{"text":"The sambusek were tasteless and the meat inside was very dry. Really disappointing.The only thing you could taste from the stuffed grape leaves in vinegar just vinegar. The beef shawarma was nothing special either. My husband said they didn't use quality meet. Only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the naan was just freshly baked and the hummus was good but that's not enough for us to try again."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here with friends. The belly dancers are very good and fun to watch. The food is delicious and service is always great. The vibe there is friendly. The portions are large so could share dishes and get to try a little of everything!"}
{"text":"dined here on february 25, 2011.  the variety of food available at this buffet is a bit limited, but maybe this is just the nature of lebanese buffets. i believe the meats available were chicken and perhaps lamb tucked into some of the dishes.   most everything is cooked in lots of oil. this place would be good for the paleo crowd, if they avoid the bean dishes.   all the cooked dishes are kept in small pans, so everything is pretty fresh as the chef will continually restocks them when they run low."}
{"text":"Ok this is a great place was awesome service was fantastic!!!!! We had the kabobs they were delicious they served fresh made pita bread to die for with this awesome dip made of olive oil thyme and sesame seeds!!!! You have to try this place ....."}
{"text":"Service is very poor and very slow (may be acceptable in the middle east, but not in the US). Home made pita bread and appetizer were good. Main dish was very mediocre. The food is overpriced (they need to cover the cost for live music). We went there because of groupon coupons. There are many good restaurants in Scottsdale with excellent food and good service that I will enjoy, so no need to go back to mijana."}
{"text":"If only the food and service matched the looks!    While it looks plain from the outside, Mijana is large and open inside, combining a fairly casual atmosphere with near fine dining visual appeal.  If I was basing this review on the look of restaurant alone, with its tall ceilings and long family-style tables, it would certainly get a 5 star rating!  HOWEVER, Mijana is probably the most over-priced and over-rated restaurant in the entire area!  With Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food not as popular as Italian and Asian fare, many of Mijana's close competitors shut their doors in response to these tough financial times and I can only guess that this lack of options/alternatives is responsible for Mijana receiving any positive reviews at all!  I have eaten here 4 times.  Twice I went with family, two other times I went with friends to see one of the weekend evening dance specials that people I know were performing in.  While I commend Mijana for supporting local dance talent, the restaurant's primary concern should be supporting the paying patrons!  After 2 tries, my immediate family refuses to return and my friends, except for the ones dancing, have not been back!  Each of the 4 times I have gone, the service has become more and more dispicable and the food has only become less and less edible.    The reheated pans of low-grade and truly off-tasting ingredients at the buffet only seem like a \"bargain\" for the price until you actually try it.  What doesn't get eaten one night seems to get reheated for the next night's dinner service and the next, etc...  The food off the regular menu is way overpriced in relation to the quality that ends up on your plate.  The dishes are unoriginal and, despite the fact that the stereotypical Mediterranean/Middle-Eastern fare should be predictable, the only thing you can count on is that it's bland and will probably be cold to the touch by the time the server finally brings it to your table!  The waitstaff is almost always insufficient (a cost-cutting measure by a greedy owner?) with only 2 servers (if you're lucky) working most weekend dinner services.  Speaking of service, it is consistently the slowest I've ever experienced at any restaurant.  Additionally, food items do not arrive together (members of my group were often served at different times and TWICE we didn't get bread for our Hummus appetizer until AFTER we completed the main courses, even though we made the server aware) and that's just the start!    Bringing any issues to the attention of the floor manager simply results in a dismissive attitude and no results...if he is in a GOOD mood!  When he's not, he'll treat you like a dog.  The way my mom and I were spoken to when we asked about drinks (after a 25 minute wait at the table without even water to sip on) was appalling!  And, the servers could care less.  They don't \"serve\", but they sure don't hesitate to express their upset when the tip is lacking.  You will not leave feeling even remotely appreciated or valued as a customer, I guarantee it!  If you do decide to dine at Mijana, prepare yourself for a long, expensive night of substandard food and the worst customer care in the Valley!  Unless your friend is dancing there that night or you want to torture your most hated in-laws, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else...anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Do you want authentic, delicious Lebanese food!? Then look no further -- you get this and more at Mirjana. Owned by a sweet Lebanese man, it's a family owned business that offers a wide range of authentic Lebanese food. Vegetarian? No problem. Have dolmeh, falafel, and possibly the BEST tabbouleh ever! Try the beet and lentil salad-- you won't be sorry. The service is wonderful. They are very attentive. Don't forget to finish the experience with some tea and their delicious pastries. You won't be sorry!  !"}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice with a group for lunch and it failed to really impress me both times even though others in the group absolutely loved it. I think the ambience is weird with the large dance floor , & I must say that the bread was fantastic"}
{"text":"This place is great food was amazing and service was awesome. I came with my american coworkers and the owner was so friendly and welcoming of offering Lebanese food. At the end he offered us to big pieces of desert on the house which was so nice of him. He also gave me a hat with the restaurant's logo on it which i love. Thank you !!"}
{"text":"Only tried it because of a Groupon. Located next to a Hookah lounge, people smoking outside so asked to be seated inside. Almost all the chairs were on top of tables - looked like they might have been renovating or something. Got seated outside. Ordered a couple appetizers and Beef Shwarma wrap. Never again. Did not have a good experience. Dealing with the aftermath this a.m. Thank goodness for Imodium."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 Service: 3/10 Value: 5/10 Decor: kinda nice  Came here on a Wednesday night. There was a big party of maybe 20 there when I went. There was a groupon for the place and I have never tried it so I thought we would go. Waited 5 minutes to get seated. There was only 1 server, which is not unexpected as it is a week night. There was a nice big screen TV with the NFL network on, which was nice. Also some Lebanese music videos which is interesting. The owner was very personable and actually greeted us. Never had Lebanese food, but it tasted pretty much like Greek/Persian food. Hummus was fresh. The bread they made was good. Got the kabobs and they were cooked well; moist win the good flavor, not dry and overdone. The service was what really got to us. Waited for the check for a good 40 minutes before their server actually brought it to us. Not sure if it would have been better if it wasn't a night of 20 people for the server. Not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Never gad Lebanese food before but my bf and I love to try new food so we went for lunch this past weekend. We had their quail & Hummus, their grill combo and Kebbeh. All of them are flavorful! I would recommend checking this place!"}
{"text":"Lunch menu on Friday. Ordered:  Hummus/Tabouleh/Babganoush Appetizer - $9, everyone's favorite dish.  Really great value, tons of food.  Comes with unlimited hot, fresh pitas.  The hummus and tabouleh were very tasty.  Gyro w/ Fries - $7, Good, not amazing. Beet and Lentil Salad - $11, very good.  Lots of lentils, tasty dressing.  Moussaka - $10, good, very filling. Stuffed Zuchinni - $10, very good.  Perfect flavoring, simple, hints of lemon.  Groupon $20 for $10 made this priced right, otherwise it would've been a bit much.    Women's restroom is very clean and pretty with candles and decorations.  There was SO much food.  I had to dig deep to try to make it look respectable, mostly from the appetizer, it just never ended.  We were the only ones in the restaurant the entire time.  It made for excellent service.  Server was very nice and professional despite the emptiness."}
{"text":"We took our friends out to dinner & chose this place off of yelp reviews. We were excited when we looked at the website promising belly dancing and live music and a Lamb Shank that falls off the bone. So the Lamb Shank lived up to the hype, but we were the only customers there for most of our visit, which actually made it kind of nice :) and no live entertainment. So we laughed out loud & enjoyed our friends.  We tried the Quail hummus... delicious! I had the fattoush salad... the taste was good but the size of the veggies was not appealing to my mouth, I would prefer a more chopped friendly salad. My friends were happy with their choices which I tried & all the food was at a high standard of preparation. The authentic beer selection was terrible.  The service was personable, very authentic & spicy ;) I liked the feel of the place, the owner was there & checked on us - he gave us coupons for the buffet & we are excited to go back for more. He also explained that they were packed through the holidays & decided to give the live entertainment some time off, but encouraged us to come back to check it out. Woohoo!  All in all, nice find!!"}
{"text":"This was the best Mediterranean food I have had in the Phoenix area. If you are around, don't miss it if you like Mediterranean food. Freshly baked pita are second to none and the sauce they come with, you gotta try them to know what awesomeness i'm talking about."}
{"text":"Solid Lebanese place. It's a restaurant but they also offer hookah, and there's entertainment on the weekends which includes belly dancing and salsa night. There's also live music certain nights, everything is on their event calendar on their website. They give complimentary fresh pita bread with a Za'atar and olive oil mixture. I ordered the Sujuk which is spicy beef sausage and it came with tomatoes, it was delicious.  I came on a Friday night and there was a belly dancing show from 7:45 to 8:15, quite impressive that it was 30 minutes long. The belly dancer is also interactive with the audience, so she might choose you to come up and dance with her. There's strobe lights, Lebanese music, overall a great and lively experience."}
{"text":"We love their bread the most! Their pita bread is very different than other middle eastern restaurants. The portions are pretty big so be careful when ordering. The meat is good but not the best and the prices are a bit higher yet they are justified because of the portions."}
{"text":"Best Babaganush and hummus !!! THE BEST !! sesame sauce that come with fresh oven baked bread (roti) is awesome ! We always get second serving of those warm bread ... so good !!"}
{"text":"Stopped her for dinner after a long day of travel and baseball.  Restaurant wasn't very busy on a Saturday at prime time.  I ordered vegetarian platter and hubby ordered mixed skewers.  Food portions were very big.  Vegetarian platter could easily serve two.  Quality of food was fair, especially on the mixed skewer platter.  Meat was chewy and it was overload of rice and salad.  I can't compare to other Mediterranean restaurants in town, but I travel regularly and prefer to choose Mediterranean restaurants for my whole food plant based WOE. This one ranks right in the middle.  I've had better and I've had worse.  Got food quickly.  Server was slow with refills and check."}
{"text":"Love this place. I order pick up when I am working from home (I live right near by). The food is great and they´re always really attentive and nice. I love the homemade bread that they serve with the food."}
{"text":"We went at lunch and I don't think any of us really like our choices.  I had the gyro wrap with side salad.  There were only a few people in there at noon so we should have got the message I love Mediterranean so I was super disappointed"}
{"text":"Was expecting a buffet, but they no longer have it. Ordered from the menu, food was good."}
{"text":"This review is for Mijana's lunch buffet. I would recommend this to anyone who would like try Lebanese cuisine and get an opportunity to try several dishes in one sitting. The dishes are well presented and I found most of them to be very good. I do wish, though, that they would have labels for the different dishes, like some buffets do, with perhaps a brief phrase describing what each dish is; for instance: \"Dolmades - vegetarian stuffed grape leaves.\"  Our group at the buffet UYE today  (Rand H., Mike C., Robyn N., and me) kept asking each other, \"What do you think this is? ... What's in here?\" because a lot of the dishes were unfamiliar, although they were really good. The service, while friendly, could be a bit more attentive. The restaurant is very spacious and seating is comfortable. Also, parking - which seems to be a problem in most other Mediterranean restaurants - is no problem here."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and it was very filling especially for the price I got from Groupon $10 for $20. The waiter was not very good though as the place only had a few people in it and I ended up having to ask for the dip for the pita bread, did not refill my glass of water for some time and soda also. Otherwise I enjoyed the chicken and beef shawarma very much and would go back regardless of the inexperienced waiter, perhaps it was his first day."}
{"text":"I was seriously impressed. They give u so much food and it's so delicious! I ordered take out and this is what I got. Definitely will be ordering again! I loved it all."}
{"text":"The food was good. The mijana grill for 2 was more than enough for my husband and I. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for us having to sit there for about 10 min until someone finally handed us a menu and there were only 3 other tables with people. The bus boy pretty much had no personality, it was the guy who first sat us down. Our waitress was super sweet and nice though. I would come back because their food was tasteful."}
{"text":"I was traveling and this restaurant was not far from my hotel, but I didn't eat here until my last day in town. I'm only sad I wish I had eaten there first, because I would have eaten there daily! It was that good. I had the beef and chicken shawarma combo. It came with hummus, rice, freshly baked bread and an ample serving of garlic butter.  For dessert, I had the Kanafe. EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious. I bought a cheese plate for my dinner and it looks wonderful as well. I had a coupon for $25. From a well know restaurant coupon place, so I ordered 3 orders of baklava to give to the wonderful hotel staff. They were ecstatic."}
{"text":"My husband & I are recent transplants to the Tempe area, & we have a fondness for Mediterranean-style food. Our 1st visit to Mijana sure didn't disappoint! We visited on a Saturday night for dinner at 6:00. Food was excellent, & our waitress was very attentative. Mijana has an extensive menu of enticing dishes. We shared chicken schawarma with hummus, which was served with freshly-made pita bread, as our appetizer. Yummy!! My fattoush salad (with grilled shrimp added) was also delicious (loved the olive oil/lemon juice dressing), & my husband was very pleased with his lamb kebab entrée. More food than we could finish! As we were finishing dinner, we enjoyed fun cultural entertainment by belly dancers. Great evening, & we definitely plan to return! We highly recommend Mijana!!"}
{"text":"Verrrry good place  Food was fresh and delicious  Server was nice and polite  The bread is freshly made and so yummy"}
{"text":"This place is a 'diamond in the rough'. You'd never know what fun would be inside due to the outdoor signage. But it's great. Our Saturday night was welcomed with a  and a great dinner and show await. We tried this place due to a LivingSocial deal we got. We had the amazingly most Lamb Shank that came with rice and veggies (enough for two to share). They give good portions here. And we ordered the Lebanese Tradition plate which has hummus, babaganosh and tabbuleh all good with pita bread provided. The belly dancer was amazing. She danced around and was authentic and tasteful for the whole family. My daughter loved watching the performance. Place seemed clean and food was tasty. Will try again for sure. With deal only ended up paying $35 for food, drinks and desserts. *Friday nights they have open dance and salsa music."}
{"text":"Loved the food!  Great happy hour specials and our waitress was terrific!  Their homemade pitas are the best in town!  The vegetarian platter...yum!  I hear they have evening entertainment...we will be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, we all ordered the chicken schwarma dinner plate and had left overs. The hummus was delicious got it free for checking in on Yelp and my friend uses a Groupon. We are bringing friends and family, we want to see the belly dance show. Excited! And I got to try a Lebanese beer, it was crisp. Great first time experience the owner or manager greeted us and we were well attended. Thank you."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I arrived for dinner. Besides us, there was only 1 couple there.  Service was extremely poor and the food was less than good.  It took us 15 minutes to get our drinks and when I needed a refill, I had to go to the bar and get it myself.  The man told me that he was busy!  He was watching TV!!!!!  One hour later - we FINALLY get our food and my husband's lamb was cold in the center.  It was obviously microwaved and not long enough to heat the center.   The pita bread had raw dough in the center and my meal was just OK.  A bellydancer asked me how my meal was and I told her that we were a little disappointed.  She went and got the owner, who would not even let me explain why we were unhappy - all he heard was \"my husband's lamb is cold\" and he cut me off and ran off with his plate and brought back the same plate - microwaved more.  He needs to learn to listen to the customer, especially when they have a valid complaint.  It was a total waste of time and money.  It took us over 2 hours to get out of there and the place was almost empty.    Mijana has become our family's inside joke. When we are hungry, we say \"how about Mijana?\" and we all start laughing.    There are much better middle-eastern restaurants in the valley and we will never be back to Mijana."}
{"text":"came here for a friend's birthday.   they charged 10 cover to dance. my wife is 39.5 weeks pregnant literally can't dance.  they failed to give us a deal at all.  so I offered to pay with my credit card.  Cashier says cash only and I need to pay at bar.  fine.  we go to the bar. no one comes to wait on us.  sit there for 20 min waiting then the security guard comes and threatens us saying we need to pay!  unbelievable!  terrible service terrible employees. no empathy for a 39.5 week pregnant woman. hopefully she suffers mean service when she is pregnant also."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the owner is so welcoming. I have never had Lebanese food before, but after coming to this place I will never go anywhere else."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a Saturday night.  They had belly dancing which was fun to see.  I had a veggie dish with eggplant and chickpeas.  It had too much oil in it. It would of been much better with less oil.  We also had the grilled chicken schwarma.  The chicken dish was better than my dish.  There was bread with our dinner and the bread had a olive oil and herb dip with it that was very good."}
{"text":"After looking and looking for a place to take a friend from Mexico to, I came across Tumbao, Latin Fridays. It was quite the drive, but I decided, why not! I have someone to dance with.   It was quite a drive, but who cares when you're in good company. We pulled into the parking lot, and I was a little thrown off by the location -- but parked anyways and as soon as we opened the car door, we heard that Latin music playing; we knew we were in the right place.   We walked up, got ID'd by a pleasant gentleman at the door, and went inside -- only to get asked to pay $10 cover per person, which kinda stinks if you get there late. They give us like a raffle ticket which we were told were good for a free soda or bottle of water at the bar -- but when is a soda or a bottle of water ever $10?! (unless of course, you're in Vegas... but this isn't Vegas!)  The music and atmosphere was great though, and I had a fun time. I would definitely go here again as it's a laid back, and a great crowd (amazing dancers too, btw!) Apparently this is a Lebanese restaurant, and I'm sure the food is great, but we didn't get to try it... Maybe another time. As far as Tumbao Latin Fridays -- I recommend! (But get there early!)"}
{"text":"We had a Group On for this place thought we would give it a try.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was what you would expect for a strip mall. A large room with lots of tables and a stage on one end and a bar at the other.  The Food was OK but nothing to go out of your way for.  We ordered two wraps One Gyro with fries One chicken Shawarma with fries  Both had good flavor but not a lot of meat. We ordered the fries extra crispy they were not so good but edible.  Now the worst part was the service. I'm hopping this was a bartender or someone just filling in he should never wait tables again. There were long wait time in between getting things, he had no personalty and didn't seem to care if we were there or not.   I could under stand the lack of attention if they were busy but there were 4 tables at the most in the restaurant. During our meal I watched as our waiter was in the prep area eating and spending time talking with other employees when he should have been taking of tables.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone to go out of there way to try.  Oh well you can't win them all."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, server was a little slow. Has belly dancing as entertainment on the weekends starting at 730PM."}
{"text":"Wow. This was a surprise. This was a group on discount so I was not sure what to expect. Luckily it turned out to be. Great surprise. I would go back without a coupon. There were four of us and we shared three items. The first was their Beirut platter which they say feeds two. It fed the four of us. Hummus. Babaganous. Cheese fries roll ups. Fresh bread that did not taste like the normal pita bread we usually get. It was light and airy. We also tried these fried spinach puffs. And had a pizza wth gyro toppings. We had leftovers for several days.  I as very impressed with this place. It was a great surprise."}
{"text":"Food was great, however, the service sucked!! Our server didn't acknowledge us at all. Did not ask if we wanted anything to drink. When we were ready to order he didn't explain anything at all to us (it was our first time). He never came back to ask us how we were doing after we got our food. He didn't ask if we needed drink refills either. We pretty much say there waiting... & waiting... & waiting... until we flagged him down for our check. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"Mijana is the place to be. Best service and no doubt best food. A++. Thank you for the best Baptism party"}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon for this restaurant!  Great offer, no exclusions  fabulous food & entertainment on Saturday night!  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I've come to Mijana multiple times for Latin night. I get it's busy, but the service was terrible. We sat down, waitress handed us menus and off she took. We kept trying to get her attention but she kept ignoring us. Finally, after 30 minutes, we got up and Asked her and she blatantly said she had forgotten. She finally took out order. One plate came out 25 mins later. The second plate took another 30. She wasn't interested in helping, she was just hanging out at the bar. Very frustrating when you're hungry and just want to eat and have a good time."}
{"text":"Delicious food...I enjoyed the hummus with homemade, tasty pita and the kofta kebab.  It was fantastic!  Convenient location in north Tempe/south Scottsdale.  Reasonably nice interior and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is my second review in which this place deserved another update! The food was very fresh! Tasted fantastic! They had a few things off only on the order!!  If the picture shows it as a single order! I believe that's exactly what I should be getting! But this place came back out and brought me more because he tried to make up for it! Thank You! It means a lot!!!  I hate that the printed sheet they get does not print out all the information they should get? I put things in there that this restaurant did not get in the print out sheet! I read it! Things were missing!  Yelp's got to get that together! All this time I thought it was the restaurant not reading the FULL ORDER!!! YELP NEEDS TO MAKE SURE all the extras that are requested are in there!!! Thx! 10/1/16   My first time enjoying this place!  Forgot a few things in my order...Lentil soup was very good...Dolmas was good but a lot smaller than the pictures! they forgot the gyro and salad...brought back the gyro but no salad...he said he was doing his best! After I paid for what I ordered! Win some lose some!"}
{"text":"Great family dinner! We went with a group of 12 for dinner and the belly dancing show. Mijana mixed plate for 1 was enough for 2 people. Chicken was our favorite and the baba gounish appetizer was delicious. Belly dancing show was awesome, entertaining and fun. We finished with the Beruit Nights dessert, which was authentic and tasted great!"}
{"text":"BEST Mediterranean food around. The jalapeno humus, homemade Caesar dressing, chicken soup, and chicken shwarma are to die for! Check before you go for the live music- they're constantly having different bands perform. Awesome awesome spot!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had some of the freshest and tastiest food at Mijana that we'd had in months.  We happened to be in the area and found a deal on Yelp for Mijana.   Mijana is located in an unassuming location, in a strip mall northwest of the Tempe Marketplace. However, when we arrived we found a fully themed restaurant, complete with fun paintings representing Lebanese culture, and rich colors - definitely a casual and fun place to take a date. Though Mijana could definitely use a paint job or a bit of sprucing up,  I was happy to see that there was a stage in the restaurant, and so though I went at lunch time I have no doubt that Mijana probably throws down some lively music at nights or over the weekend.  i.e., If you're dancing at night you probably wouldn't notice the paint.   The service was good, and the food was pretty healthy.  The portions were large, and so the good news is that you'll have plenty of food to take home with you after a meal here."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went here tonight for dinner and it was wonderful! Good food, great service,  and fun belly dancer show. We will def be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh these guys are great.  We've gotten Postmates from there twice- the first time it was perfect and amazingly delicious.  The second time- still amazing and delicious but they forgot the pita.  Even though they don't do delivery, Trevor had someone jump in their can and come drop them off themselves.    The food is delicious and they really go above and beyond.  Thank you sand much Trevor and Mijana!"}
{"text":"I was just in Beirut & was craving Lebanese Mezze so tried it out for first time.... Was VERY authentic, I was VERY pleased with the Beirut Platter... I will def be back, next time in the evening to see the belly dancers!!!"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. On the Saturday night we were there, the music was extremely loud, even though the place was almost empty. The food was not good, although the hummus was ok. It was nothing like original Lebanese dishes, and it was not fresh. I also have to mention both my husband and I got food poisoning due to something we ate that weekend, and we both have a strong feeling it was that Lebanese food. The restaurant itself is not very clean. The waitress we had was nice, but we had to wait for her for quite some time when we wanted to order something. So I asked another waitress and she was not happy I approached her. In sum, we were sorry we went there."}
{"text":"Just had Dinner at Mijana and it was delicious as always. The staff was very accommodating as always and I always enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Where should I start from? Let's see.  Food is overpriced and average, and I mean average. Service is horrible. Went there last night with my husband, called an hr in advance to confirm that they would take our voucher, and that there is no smoking inside. Well we were told they don't accept groupons after 930. Their staff is extremely disorganized, everyone is eithrr moving tables around, or just standing there not sure what to do. I even saw a few crickets inside, which was a big turn off. They also had hookahs for a large party inside the restaurant, again contradictory to what we were told.  Bottom line- not worth it."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place that was found through groupon. Many of the reviews made it seem like a pretty good place to try. When we first got there, the staff was setting up for a wedding party so we had to eat outside-which was not a big deal since it was nice outside.   That's when it started to go all downhill. The only positive experience was the bread that was brought out before the meal. It was delicious! Many of the food and drink items were NOT available due to \"having a busy weekend, we couldn't restock,\" (which upon further inspection of reviews this seems to be a common problem at this place) according to our waitress. There was only one waitress available so the service was definitely below par, which was hard to believe since there were only three tables (including us) to serve. Then finally when the food came out there were TWO blonde hairs found in the food (and that's only what was FOUND, I can only imagine how many more might have been in there). The fries DRIPPED grease. Literally, you could twist the fries and grease would POUR out.  I would NEVER go here again, and would tell everyone to steer clear of this place. Especially if you were paying full price for these meals, definitely overpriced!"}
{"text":"I came here because I saw a post on Craigslist about salsa lessons and Latin night , nice looking place , hostess and host were very friendly and welcomed me , I grabbed a table by the bar , I ordered at the bar as I didn't see a server , it looked like they were pretty busy so I didn't worry about that , I ordered drinks and food , I took the salsa class , it was fun . Once I got back to my table , I ordered more drinks , went to the dance floor to dance and when I came back I saw a \"chair hugger\" sneaking my chair , I grabbed it back (having drinks on the table in Arizona apparently means nothing to other people) , I went back to dance on the floor and two men sat on my table , it was kind of weird how no one there wanted to respect that , I got there 1 hour before the craziness started so I would have a place to seat but people seems to not care , I am Colombian , yeah , feisty , so , please be respectful to me or you'll find trouble haha :) I would've never taken other people's chairs , don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you . After having a \"talk\" to the \"the chair hugger\" , I wanted to leave , she seemed rude , but I was there to have fun , so I looked for a table by the dj , found one and stayed there for about 2 hours , it was a fun experience besides the bad manners of some . I'm coming back here every week and I'll make sure to be on a place where no one want to seat so I don't have a bad time :)  Food was ok (maybe just what I ordered ) , I recommend the sangria ."}
{"text":"I ordered a mixed chicken and beef  shawarma for pickup the other day and while the shawarma was great and flavorful, the hummus tasted absolutely spoiled which was a disappointment..."}
{"text":"Went to Mijannas last night. What I love is getting Pita Bread fresh from their brick oven hot and puffy and steaming and wrapped in a red towell in a nice basket retaining the heat and  the freshness. They have wonderful dishes to complement their fresh Pita. The Fresh Pita starts out too hot touch. They have wonderful toppings for the Fresh Pita. The Fresh Hot Pita tastes and smells and feels so greatl that the mishmash of imperfections of this authentic Lebanese restaurant fade into insignificance!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Service was fine. Nice atmosphere and music. Kids enjoyed trying new foods. Groupon brought us in. Thanks much."}
{"text":"We've been here 4 times because of the Groupon and the past two times were subpar. Not sure if the waiter has 7 tables or if he just needs to find a new career! Tall blonde guy, the wings, were taken of the bill because they were so dang dry! Next they ran out of Hennessy, seriously Hennessy is a common drink! Next the wAters were empty for over a half hour, said he'd get a new cup with new ice and NEVER brought it and took over 10 minutes to bring the third round of drinks and that's when we were informed the Hennessy ran out, but he still brought the vodka drink, why would we want that if 2 of the 3 people weren't getting their drinks! Also the coal for the hookah took more than 20 minutes to replace! Serious improvements need to happen to say the least. Oh and lastly automatic gratuity was added and in our opinion he didn't deserve more than 5%. Very sad, I'll happily change this review if the owner would like to personally speak to me and make things right!"}
{"text":"ok, ok...so for the first 30 minutes we had fun with the name of this restaurant...but then we simmered down and got down to some serious eating business. We went with another couple on a Saturday night at 6pm. Ambiance - The place was packed with a huge party, but that just made the atmosphere fun! There was background music and a couple belly dancers.....We were seated in a private booth and could engage in conversation with no problems. I grew up in Australia with Lebanese family friends and was privy to delight in authentic Lebanese food at family events,  so I am familiar with the real deal. Having lived in Arizona for 15 years, I crave traditional ethnic food. This place did not disappoint; In fact at times I was rendered speechless. I ordered the vegetarian platter - baba ganoush (amazing and not bitter at all), hummus (thick and creamy), tabouleh (light and not too garlicky) and the most delicious light and soft dolmas I have ever had. I also ordered a side of kibbe which were tasty little morsels, but needed a little more zing. The accompanying yoghurt dressing was delicious. My friends had a the lentle soup and chicken shishkabob and said both were amazing. We are currently planning a return visit with the kids.....  oh and the dipping bread is warm and light...fresh out of the oven  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love love love this restaurant! Great food and entertainment! The belly dancers are amazing to watch. My boyfriend and I have been here several times. He is from Tunisia and loves this place. One evening they had an event with a cover charge and we just wanted drinks. Instead of letting us go elsewhere for cocktails the owner offered us seats on the patio so we could enjoy the evening with sheesha and drinks. Definitely knows how to treat a customer. Very impressed with this establishment and will be back!"}
{"text":"Food took forever to arrive and when it did, it was a disappointment. Salad was quite sour, and the grill meats was dry and didn't have much flavor to it. Didn't seem like much food, but the bill sure was a surprise!!  The only interesting thing they have is belly dancing and salsa dancing for the night."}
{"text":"This place has great Lebanese food! I came for lunch in the week day but will def come back to see the belly dancers on a weekend. I ate the tabouli salad with chicken kabob. Perfect meal, not to heavy!"}
{"text":"Well you can't give 0 stars !This was the most horrible experience from bland food to sub-par customer service. I do not suggest large crowds for this place they can not handle it. My drink was never refilled the 2 hrs I was there. Our server was over whelmed he had no help, the table was full of dishes. The food was not worth the money. Stay away !"}
{"text":"I genuinely love this place. Very good food and nice staff. Very vegetarian friendly. I recommend the sangria."}
{"text":"I purchased the yelp deal $10 for $20. My girl friend and I decided we get some dinner then head out to old town for some fun. We arrived around 9 hoping to leave by 10p.m. 10:30 the latest. We didn't end up leaving until 12:30a.m. We had such a great time. I absolutely love this place! Upon arrival we were seated very quickly, menus distributed, and we were explained the entertainment for the evening. Our server Maria was the best! I was so appreciative of the time she spent with us. Explaining their different nights, country, salsa/tango, belly dancing and review the menu. She was very attentive. I love the hookah bar next door. Hookah, music, food, and belly dancing! The service was amazing. The food was delicious, and the entertainment a blast! I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing atmosphere my husband and I came here for our date night and we loved it. The lamb shank is to die for and the hummus is so delicious did I mention the pitas are made fresh they are warm light and extremely flavorful"}
{"text":"This is our second visit and with the groupon the prices can't be beat.  There are a variety of vegetarian options.  The beef is very tender.  The chicken had a lot of flavor. The best part was there was a lot of both on the plate.  So far they have all been yummy.  Everything tastes very fresh.   Their is music and dancing on Thursday nights.  Belly dancing occurs every Friday and Saturday. Very fun place to be, with really good food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was lively, yet unpretentious. Staff was attentive as was the friendly owner. The entertainment is phenomenal and the food is excellent. I don't have one negative comment on this place, I love it!"}
{"text":"My friend invited me to dinner last night and I was super skeptical of the place she chose. I'm a very picky eater who has been trying out the vegetarian life for 3 months now and have never had Mediterranean or Lebanese food. Anyways we went on a Wednesday night around 6 PM. There was only one other couple there and our waiter sat us quickly and was very attentive.  He answered all of our questions knowledgeably and helped me decide on the pesto pizza which was delicious. Other staff we interacted with were friendly as well.   It's a very large restaurant and they were playing music at just the right level. I also noticed they have a live stage for shows which would be cool to come back for.   The only reason I gave four stars is because the computer was off-line and our order was never put in so we waited almost 45 minutes for our food.   Anyways the waiter informed us about the mishap, apologized and the delicious food made up for.   The overall experience was good and I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"We ordered the Shawarma Combo and it was juicy, and so tasty. The chickens flavor was completely different than I expected and what a treat.  The bread was Iike a pita and I made a pita sandwhich.  Highly recommend the dish.  We had the cramel cheesecake which was a little small, but the sweet taste made up for it.  Make sure to try it.  Our server was Shawnee and she did a great job taking of us. We never had to ask for water and she brought us substitutions like eggplant instead of hummus at no charge. Make sure to ask for her."}
{"text":"Pita bread was very good.  Disappointed with the fattoush. I ordered it as a carry out. When I was ready to eat it, I opened the carton and it had dressing on it and all the pita chips soaked up dressing. Also, the tomatoes in it tasted old. I threw them out.  Mixed shawarma was not like I'm used to. I had a couple bites and put it down. Not good in my opinion. The saffron rice was fair.  Hummus had too much tahini and wasn't lemony at all. It tasted pasty.   Even though I was hungry, I threw most of it out.   I am middle eastern and hear my friends say how good it is there. I didn't think so."}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday with our extended family of 16 on a Friday evening. Great choice. We ordered the family style option and it was absolutely delicious. The entertainment was fun (belly dancing). Great place for kids as well. The only downside was that the waiter was not fully attentive and we had to chase him down for water refills and the kids meals. All in - a fantastic choice."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Saturday night for dinner with friends.... and ended up staying like 4 hours!  We ordered drinks, hookah, and dinner menu items.  The food was delicious, and the homemade pita bread was outstanding. The hookah was delicious... but the real standout here was the service.  Everytime I thought we may need new coals... BAM, there they were offering us new coals.  If we were close to being out of a drink, BAM, another drink would appear! They even brought over complimentary smoothie tastings, and gave us $10 off coupons for our next visit.  After 9:30pm there was a live band that played inside and people danced on the dance floor, and there was a belly dancer performing on the patio!  Loved loved loved it."}
{"text":"Ok. More drunken reviews. I have been here over 3 times, so why then the 4 star review.   The lebanese beer and wine are crappy and they pushed it on me to try it. Bummer. But the food is flipping awesome ! Man those pita breads are warm and fresh out the oven. The chiken kababs are delish ! Yummy in my tummy. The service is very good, and we've alway left here happy. Very good overall.   Words of advice: Salsa night aint all that packed. Stay away from the lebaneese wine. Aint no good ! And the bartender doesnt know how to open it without getting the cork in ! lol !"}
{"text":"The staff was not friendly and helpful at all. She would take for ever to come back and ask for order also bring the food. We chose 3 different foods and she came back 15 minutes after taking the orders to let us know one of the foods is not available while she brought the other 2 foods !! And finally when she brought my friends salad she spilled the salad juice on my friends pants ! Not satisfied at all and will not be back !"}
{"text":"This place is classier than Haji-Baba and more gourmet than Sahara's. Please note that you pay more for this than the other two places.   *Belly dancers are there on Fri. and Sat. starting at 7:30pm.   *Though it's a Lebanese restaurant, they do have a full bar.   I love the atmosphere at Mijana's. The portions are huge and had I known I would not have ordered two things. The lentil soup was warm, thick and creamy. It tasted gourmet to me. I've never had fattoush before and it was alright. Tastes somewhat like a Greek salad to me. They serve generous amounts of pita as a free appetizer and they give you sesame seed oil for dipping. Their Arabic coffee is not sweet like at Sahara but still good. We arrived when the waitress was on a lunch break and the manager offered us a place to sit and he would serve instead. For that, he's awesome."}
{"text":"If you LOVE good authentic Mediterranean food, do not hesitate go running NOW Lol  OMG I honestly cannot believe I have not rated this restaurant before!   We love everything from here! Hands down best fresh pita bread anywhere, amazing hummus, perfectly seasoned shawarma! Ahh it's everything...  So the service is pretty bad on a good night, it's tough finding good helpers  I'm not going to knock off their rating for that, I've seen the owner himself help serve his guest and that deserves 5 stars alone. The food is amazing, so yummy we go all the time (:"}
{"text":"\"Oh, our happy hour starts later because Wednesdays are hip hop night.\"  Well, OK then.  It was a weird experience at Mijana, but I thought the food was first rate.  I started with Lebanese beer named Alamaza.  It was a refreshing pilsner like a Heineken or a Carlsberg.  Fresh baked pita are served to the table with zatar, a dried herb and oil dipping sauce.  The pita had that homemade softness and yeasty flavor.  It wasn't chewy or sweet like store bought.  The zatar had a subtle flavor but a lot of aroma, smells that reminded me of my trips to the Middle East.  Hold off on pita refills because more come with dinner.  We ordered the shawarma combo for two, except it may as well have been a shawarma combo for 8.  It came on a big platter with hummus, rice, and a lightly dressed salad.  We had leftovers for days.  (I wish there was more hummus... we actually finished that.)  The chicken was better than the beef, which was a little tough.  Both were flavorful.  The rice had a light seasoning, but didn't overwhelm the meat.  Service was slow, but not inordinately slow.  Without any complaining, they comp'd us a free slice of chocolate cake.  The place has a large bar on one end, a stage on the other, and about as many tables and chairs as you can fit in between, all in neatly arranged rows.  It seems like they use it for receptions because they do.  They also have a night dedicated to salsa dancing, one for salsa dancing, and I'm forgetting one or two others.  They also have belly dancers on some nights... there's a lot going on at Mijana."}
{"text":"MEH!  Purchased a groupon and had dinner here last night. Read that there was a belly dancing show so we booked our reservation at 7:30pm, since the show starts at 7:30pm. The place was empty around 7:30pm on a Friday night. The belly dancing show is one girl who does three routines in a 25 minute time span with breaks and it's over...so don't blink. The reason I gave this place three stars is because the food is bland and the meat is dry. Pita Jungle serves better food than this place. I would rather go and spend fifty bucks and get great food than to sit and eat mediocre \"bland\" Arabic food and watch a girl thrust her stuff for 25 minutes. We had good service because the place was empty on a Friday night. So if you want want to be entertained and eat bland food come here."}
{"text":"Very clean. Located just off the Loop 202 freeway. This place has the best Lebanese food in Arizona; not to mention their bread that is baked in house, and fresh each day. There is even live music and belly dancing on certain nights."}
{"text":"Great ambience, REALLY friendly staff, reasonable prices and delicious food with generous portions."}
{"text":"We have eaten at many Middle eastern restaurants and this is right up there with the best. Food was fresh, and tasty. Service was very good, and the belly dancers were a nice bonus. Overall we really enjoyed this place and will come back the next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tasty! The owner is welcoming and extremely knowledgeable and will talk with you about the cuisine and culture of Lebanon. We found this place through a Groupon that allowed us to take a Saturday cooking class. It was well organized and a lot of fun plus we left extremely full and happy! We plan on coming back to visit for sure."}
{"text":"We ate at Mijana on our last night in Phoenix and it was a great way to end our trip.  The food came out quickly, portions were generous, and I had an Almaza beer for the first time in a really long time.  The only problem was that my fork and knife needed to be wiped down and the glass that came with the beer wasn't clean.  I'm guessing the dishwasher isn't working right and I hope they fix it soon.  The ambiance is really interesting, the space is very industrial and edgy with the unfinished ceiling and color changing lights scattered around the room.  Thinking back on it, it was pretty cool.  I'd definitely come back here and I could see Mijana becoming a regular part of a \"last night in Phoenix/Tempe\" ritual, especially if they get the dishwasher working better."}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions!  Healthy fare, clean & delicious taste!  Entertainment Thursday - Saturday!  Group Dance lessons. Cozy dining atmosphere.  Authentic Middle Eastern music.  Convenient location just North of the 202 on Scottsdale Rd.  Free & ample parking.  Friendly Service."}
{"text":"I would love to review this place, considering we had a reservation for 5 p.m. We get there at 5, just to be turned away because they had 'a private party', but we could come back at 6.  I gave it two stars because while I was extremely annoyed at being turned away when I had been looking forward to shawarma all day, the place looked nice and smelled like something good was cooking."}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean style restaurants I've been to in a long time.  The cuisine is Lebanese and the food is fabulous.  We started with appetizers - the olive and pickle platter and the falafel plate.  Both very good - there must have been a jars worth of pickles on the plate (although definitely not from a jar).   The entrees were the stars.  The Mijana platter for one was very good but the Lentil and Beet Salad was outstanding - the carmelized onions, lentils, feta, greens, cucumbers, etc.. was a flavor filled delight.  The combination Shwarma platter rivaled the salad - tender pieces of marinated meat and chicken served over rice that melted in your mouth. We were full but based on the quality of the rest of the meal we had to try desert.  The waitress recommended the Knefeh (not sure I've spelled that right), and boy was she right, a blend of slightly sweetened cheese with semolina noodles that I can only describe as a Lebanese crème brulee.  A great way to end the meal.  We would have loved to top it off with Turkish coffee but it was late and we needed to get home to sleep... and to dream of our lovely meal at Mijana."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie- I'm easy to please, but Mijana is a cut above.  Over the past year I've made a conscious effort to try independent, local businesses with greater frequency, and I've come across some real treasures.  Mijana is a shining example of this.  I've been to Mijana several times, and it's because of a combination of service and taste.  The very first time I came in was on a Sunday afternoon, and I hadn't the foggiest idea of many of the items I was trying.  The waitress actually took me up to the buffet after my lunch, and walked me through everything I had just tried.  I enjoyed everything but the baba ghanouj, and that was an issue of texture rather than taste- I've never cared much for eggplant anyways.  Honestly, I've never tried anything but the buffet, and part of that is because I have a huge appetite.  It's not a 50-dish ensemble, but man, the 20 or so items on there are swell.  The pita bread is made on-site, and quite frankly is the best I've ever had- light, fluffy, and warm.  I plan on dining here many more times in the future, as I just genuinely enjoy it so much."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place is DELICIOUS! Everything is so fresh, so flavorful, literally the best falafels we've EVER had! Not only that, it's a spacious, cleanly restaurant. The staff is so kind; not only was our waitress attentive, sweet, and quick, but also one of the staff members brought me and my friend both bags of fresh pita bread to take home with us after we gushed how amazing it was! Do yourself a favor and eat here. I certainly will be coming again."}
{"text":"Best Lebanese Food and Shawarma Ever!  We found this place through a Groupon deal and I like Lebanese food so of course I was ready to try this spot out! After years of eating here now and this is my favorite restaurant now!  Jalapeño Hummus is a nice way to start off! Great flavor and just the right amount of spicy to it! Delicious!  The Shawarma Combo is the most wonderful explosion of wondrous flavor ever! I eat lots of shawarma and even make my own. The combo for two is quite exceptional to the point of being rather excellent, quite possibly even outstanding!  I get the pot of Turkish coffee and the tiramisu for desert for the best finale ever.   Good music everyday....   Live belly dancing Friday and Saturday nights makes an event out of dining!  They have a bar here if you want to get your drink on....  Stop by and tell them Vladimir sent you!"}
{"text":"groupon NOW!!! we've never tried this place but a friend was coming into town and requested \"some sort of ethnic food\" so we headed over to Mijana.   it was very sparse inside...a little eerie. but we were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken. i opted for a vodka limeade and it was very sour....i liked it alot!  i ordered a lentil dish, and the wife and friend ordered a tomato lentil dish. i thought both dishes were very tasty and the side of tzeziki (sp?) was very cucumbery-creamy. the side of pita bread was warm and delicious and i thought overall the meal was quite enjoyable. there were belly dancers there, but i like to eat in relative peace when i'm out with the wife so it was a bit distracting.   i thought the prices were reasonable and there are plenty of options for non-meat eaters."}
{"text":"Great friendly service. The best fresh pita bread I've ever had! The food is very tasty"}
{"text":"No nonsense fare. I've had better Mediterranean food, albeit not at Phoenix, I must confess.   This was a takeout, I ordered around 9:40pm, and they had it ready for pickup around 10:15pm.   This is a big deal if you've taken a flight into phx, hungry for something, and have prior knowledge that most restaurants in Phoenix close by 9pm.   So, for being available this late and for being somewhat punctual - that's one star each, and a third for the decent food."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. They have cover charges that they don't tell you about. The hookah quality is bad. I am always disappointed here, and will never go back."}
{"text":"I miss this delicious spot. The owner was so humble and beyond kind with me and my daughter. We ordered so much food and come to find out I forgot my wallet at home. I never felt so embarrassed I had to flag down my server and she went ahead and spoke with the owner who happened to be there and on his way out. He comped our food and I was in disbelief. Best Lebanese food in Arizona and I recommend it to anyone. It's a restaurant at day and in the evening it turns into a nightclub. They also offer food classes so you may learn how to cook authentic Lebanese food. If you have not been there please stop in and try them out you won't regret it."}
{"text":"OK so the service is slow... But it's totally worth it! The food here is amazing. We get the Mixed Grill and always have leftovers. Go for the garlic sauce on your meat- so good."}
{"text":"We had never been to this restaurant before, but it was highly recommended by some of our Arab friends. Several people at our group bough a Groupon for this first experience. Service was mediocre, i expected much more for the price, the waitress took a very long time to come take our order (there were only three other tables in the entire restaurant.) I looked at an empty glass of water numerous time, and when we asked about dessert the waitress told us that we could get up and go look at the display! Food was delicious though, I'll give the kitchen staff that much.  When it came time too pay, the waitress took the first bill along with the groupon, charged it and then proceeds to tell the rest of our party that she can only accept one Groupon per table. So, not only did I pay for the Groupon, I also paid for the full price of the meal!  The food might've been delicious, but it is not worth the terrible service. Will never go back to this establishment an will not recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Went to their Latin night and the lady at the front was not welcoming at all and borderline rude. Got there at 9:30pm. Met the lady collecting money and giving wristbands. The floor was not cleared for dancing so I said hi asked her if there is Latin night tonight or is it canceled. She had one hand messing with her phone, the other took out a wristband, shove it towards me, and said \"$10\". That's all she said to me. Not even a hi or eye contact, just \"10 dollars!\". I was a bit taken back at her attitude. I said, \"ok...when is the social dancing?\" And handed her the money. She puts down her phone, and appeared annoyed at me and said, \"lesson first then open dancing\" with a somewhat unpleasant tone. I don't know what her problem is but her attitude is very poor and demeanor is not welcoming at all, especially being a receptionist."}
{"text":"Not too shabby I guess.  I wasn't too impressed with the food here.  I ordered the beef shawarma not too sure what it really was.  The hummus was pretty good along with my pita bread.  However, that wasn't the main meal. The beef was pretty dry along with the dry bed of rice.  Needless to say, I needed some water!  I must give them kudos for the sangria. It looked pretty cloudy at first, but when you take the first sip....oh yeah it's good!   Service is pretty good and and fast.  I appreciate the belly dancing show and the floor turns into a salsa dancing fest during the evening.  I've danced here many times and it's pretty good since there's actually room for you to move around.  However, ventilation is rough....sweat! - Enjoy"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever received at a restaurant. My wife's food came out 20 minutes before mine. I ordered an iced tea, but didn't get it for almost 30 minutes. After we ate our meals we waited another half hour to get our check. The food was okay, but I wouldn't make a special trip to get some. We were ignored for most of our dining experience, while others were taken care of and treated like family. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Just barely 4 stars and that's because the food was very good.  Went here for the lunch buffet today with Rand H, Norm R and Mike C.  The buffet is small, but with lots of yummy stuff.  I only wish I knew what most of it was because nothing was labeled.  When we asked our waiter? what kind of soup, he said he didn't speak English but would go to the back and find out; it was lentil soup, and it was very good.   There was hummus, baba ghannoush and a couple other unknown dips to eat with the delicious homemade pita bread.  Check out Norm R's photos of the puffy pita pockets - they tasted as good as they looked!  There were stuffed peppers, chicken on the bone and a couple platters of red sauce - one had beans and an unknown meat - another had squash? with what seemed to be lamb meatballs.  I just wish they had some sort of dessert other than the canned fruit cocktail and some sort of pudding? that tasted good, but again, we had no idea what it was.  Baklava would have been the perfect ending to the meal.    The service was almost non existent, the music was a little too loud for lunch even after Rand asked them to turn it down a bit, and not only did we have to chase them down for our check, we actually paid standing at the waiter station.    I did check out their regular menu and while everything looks good, it seems a little pricey.  The lunch buffet was reasonably priced at $9.95."}
{"text":"First time here; enticed by Groupon special. Lydia our server was very pleasant, friendly and she had a lot of middle eastern food knowledge. We had the magnum grill for 2. Excellent!!! The jalepeno humus is delish on fresh warm pita bread."}
{"text":"Had a few great experiences here. Food is excellent. The homemade pita and Za'tar is worth coming here for alone (which I've actually done for takeout). Some of the sampler meals are big enough to be split among two people so that and an appetizer could keep your costs down. Live belly dancing on weekends too."}
{"text":"Amazing. I was looking for a nice healthy gluten-free lunch and boy did I find one. The falafel salad with hummus on the side was an amazing lunch. I am so happy I found this place. It's cute quaint and very very clean. Looks like a fun place to go for dinner with bellydancing and all kinds of entertainment. Falafel are definitely on my top fall off a list in Arizona"}
{"text":"The place in general is good .. the food is most of the times good sometimes bad .. the hookah is most of the times good sometimes bad .. almost everything in this place got its own ups and downs .. the only one thing that does change is a waitress called Olivia. .. he is always great, positive, energetic, with a big smile on her face .. me and my friends are regular customers of this place because of her."}
{"text":"Very good! Menessa, the owner was sitting outside and personally invited me in. The lunch buffet was fresh, with lots of rich and delicious flavors. I tried about 10 items, the worst I would rate at 8/10. I was in a bit of a hurry but will be back. I was planning on replacing a trip to starbucks with some Mijana Turkish Coffee, I did not try theirs today but have tried other Turkish Coffee and it is usually a delicious pick me up!"}
{"text":"Hot fresh pita Everything we tasted was super. We ordered the vegetarian dinner as an Appetizer had everything we wanted to taste.   Dinner was from the grill and was.delicious as well. We found this on Group on Drove from Peoria and will go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service... A dinner that should have only been about an hour or so took forever... Servers were very rude... drinks were not maintained... Food took forever... the music was so loud for the dancers and for the in-between time that my husband and I could not even talk to each other...  the live dancers were hmmm so so... and being from Dearborn MI ( the 2nd largest middle eastern community in the world other than the middle east) I think I know Arabic or middle eastern food... the food is nothing to write home about... save your self the time and belly ache and go to haji baba in Tempe  on main... http://www.yelp.com/biz/haji-baba-tempe this place knows Arabic.. In fact the cook is from Michigan"}
{"text":"My favorite shwarma place!! Great food and service, thought prices are on the higher end. They have belly dancing shows on the weekend. We were there last night, but there was a private event hosted inside the restaurant, so we were seated outside in the patio which was perfect because it was nice out. Despite that they were serving the private party, they managed to bring out our orders in a timely manner, got everything correct on the check, and multiple times- apologized for not filling water in time. Service was just  on point. I ordered the shwarma combo that came with chicken and beef, on top of saffron rice, with a side of salad and hummus. It was SO amazing! So flavorful and fresh and filling. I'd recommend getting beef shwarma- it will not disappoint!  They also make their own pita bread.. so warm and fresh!!  Without a doubt, you'll find me circling back to Mijana again to try their tea and some other dishes next time."}
{"text":"I was impressed, ordered delivery through Eat24. I was concerned when there was no answer at the restaurant because I wasn't sure if get my food. Boy oh boy, was I ever happy when the kind man was at my door. I placed my order around 8:50 and they were here within the hour.   We had the shawarma and humus, the chicken skewer thingy off the grill, greek salad and the baklava.  Yea, this is a great delivery option for me. There's Naan too, or something of the sort.   This was one of the nights where I was pleasantly surprised and I hope it's just as good when I order again. I will try and call to place an order next time buuuut, based on the experience contacting them tonight I might not have luck going directly through them. I'd have given 5 stars as I usually do if they'd had someone answer their telephone.  Thank you Mijana for dinner this evening it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to Mijana for lunch and dinner -I originally tried it on a whim using Groupon.  The food is fresh, authentic, excellent.  The venue is very large, spacious, and tastefully decorated.  The server was friendly and knowledgeable and also let us know about their Friday/Saturday music and dance lessons.  I have tried about 6-7 dishes by now and you really cannot go wrong -these are homemade recipes made fresh. Do not pass-up the homemade pita bread and baklava (to die for).  I am from Tempe and this is the best Middle Eastern food here!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place. What I thought would be cool was to see the belly dancing. We got there around 7:00 and got seats at the front. I ordered the chicken shawarma which was really good. My friend ordered the garlic shrimp which I tried and it tasted really good.  I would definitely go back. I checked in thru yelp and got a free order of hummus which had a very good taste."}
{"text":"We went for dinner tonight and we were not overly impressed. The food was okay, chicken on my combo plate was a bit dry. The best part of the meal was the fresh pita bread. There is much better Mideastern food in the Valley. The prices were high but the cost for us was offset by the Groupon we had. What was really awful was the service, it's Sunday night the place wasn't too busy. We waited a long time for anyone to take our order. Our food came quick but that was it. No water refills, no how is everything? no can I get you anything else? No dessert menu, etc. We were finished eating and waited 25 mins for someone to bring our check. We have a one year, and and it's 8 at night. We were ready to go. I usually always tip 20% +++, this time we didn't. We won't be back and I don't think they'll notice either way. Sometimes you can see why some businesses are always on Groupon."}
{"text":"We've picked up Mijana take out a few times and dined in the restaurant for the first time today. The food is very good.  The portions are generous and the food is fresh. We've tried the beef and chicken schwaramas, the gyro, the french fries, and the chicken kabob. It's all very mild, but flavorful.    The prices are a tad on the high side ($3 for a kid's lemonade), but if you get a groupon or a yelp deal, it helps.  The biggest draw for us is that at lunch, it's virtually empty, making it a great place for business meeting lunches because you can eat well and talk in a quiet environment. The food is made to order so it's not super fast, but if you have the time for a dine-in restaurant, give this one a try."}
{"text":"Saw the Groupon for Lebanese food and thought we'd check it out.  We had the lamb kabobs, falafel and a salad.  Everything tasted very good and the portions were huge.  Me and my friend couldn't get enough of the pickled beets!  The service was friendly, a couple of people came out to see how we were enjoying our meal.  I would definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! But the service was incredibly slow and not attentive at all and the place was a quarter full. We would have to get up and go to the bar to refill our water and several glasses of wine would be forgotten. The band was excellent I feel that they should start much earlier then 10;00pm to maximize the small amount of audience and its a long time between the belly dancer (7:30-8:30). And the time the band starts (10:10)."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food and atmosphere is awesome! We were here when they had a belly dancer perform and that was so fun. The dessert Kenafe was the most delicious part of the meal. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was a guest of a friend who was hosting a family style dinner on Arabian night which included live traditional Arabic/Iraqi music and belly dancers.  I will start by saying although I was a guest; I was made to feel just like part of the family and was told I was going to have a great time, which I most certainly did. Our evening started with an Arabic serenade and the tempo progressed throughout the evening. Our dinner was family style so I didn't order off the menu which I was perfectly fine with. The Lebanese dinner included a salad, piles of pita bread, hummus, babaghanouj, dipping oils, a fried appetizer platter, Beef/ Chicken Shawarma and rice.  I enjoyed all the food and the host ensured my plate was constantly replenished which was a welcomed gesture.  I devoured every helping.   During dinner we were entertained by belly dancers who captivated the entire restaurant.  These dancers were quite talented and had everyone out of their seat dancing and throwing handfuls of money at them. It was magical.   Aside from the great entertainment, I was pulled out to the dance floor and participated in a traditional group dance- everybody was dancing in their traditional belly dancing style.  I had no reservations showing off my best Shakira inspired \"hips don't lie\" moves.  I fit right in.  After the dance, we all took a break to enjoy some Hookah out on the patio provided by Hookah Mania which is hip hookah lounge located next door. This wasn't a dream. It really happened."}
{"text":"This place was great! Food was amazing entertainment was fun. The caprice was very acceptable. The amount of food that they serve is very generous. We will be back 4sure!!"}
{"text":"Was so impressed and excited about this restaurant! When I lived in Phoenix I drove by them for years and finally decided to get a restaurant.com gift card! I never used it while I live in Phoenix, so while out for a visit I tried it out with a friend. As soon as you walk into the restaurant you are greeted by the amazing smell of onions, garlic, and cayenne pepper! All of the smells just linger and dance at your nose! I selected a table and went through their menu. They have a great selection of chicken, beef, and vegetarian dishes. After debating for a few minutes I decided to get the chicken shwarma, which came with rice, a salad, and yogurt dip. My friend got their beef platter and a side of fries.   Before our meals they brought out pita bread with this brown dip with seeds in it that had a nice kick to it as well. I wish I would have asked what was in it as it was delicious and went so well with the warm pita bread.   My dish was excellent. The chicken had the right amount of spices and was not super salty or dry. The rice had a good crunch and I love that the salad had pickles and beets! The yogurt dip was also super tasty and I used that as a dip with the chicken and salad.   The customer service was just okay. Our waitress seemed a little pre-occupied with something in the back, so she did not stop by very much. The restaurant was not super busy despite it being lunch time, so I am not sure what was going on. One of the managers checked on us and assisted when he could. But, we did not get much out of our waitress.  With our meals and tax it only came to $35 and we took a lot of food home, so come prepared for that."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and tried the garlic shrimp which was amazing ! We also tried the beef Kabob over rice. This dish was good as well.  The meals come with fresh bread straight from the oven and dipping sauce. The wait staff was very warm friendly and  attentive.  I would definitely go back to see the belly dancing show."}
{"text":"Trevor, the manager made this experience really good. To be honest we did not get the chance to enjoy our meals in the restaurant because of our time limit. Our company came here during our one hour lunch break and we had to rush getting in and out with only one server on the floor. The manager personally went into the back and helped with cooking, packing, and processing payments. Due to our circumstance we were given a 20% off discount on our meals. Although, we could not sit to enjoy we enjoyed our food to go and it was amazing. It was a bit rushed but considering the circumstance I cannot deduct from the quality and service. Their intentions here were very well, the manager and server were extremely apologetic and sweet. I will be going back again when we do not have a time limit and sit down to enjoy. Thanks Trevor!"}
{"text":"The food at Mijana is very good.  But what made this an outstanding experience was the owner's attention to his guests.  He personally served us after I had to move away from the speakers for the belly dancing (I have hearing loss and didn't want more of that).  My wife and I were impressed that he's that attentive.  And the food was very good.  We met a party there, and they were seated at a very good table for the show (right near the corner, and the speakers).  So even before we arrived, the owner's attention to his guests paid off for our party.  They all said they wanted to return, though it's about a 20-to-25 mile drive for them.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The mixed grill plate hit the spot perfectly.  Kafta, kebab,  & chicken over saffron rice & salad.  I was switching from both the yogurt sauce & garlic sauces. I couldn't decide which one was better.  Everyone had noted on Yelp of the huge portions so I knew I had lunch for work tomorrow. I did have to control myself & not eat all the hot pita bread. The herb, sesame & olive oil dipping sauce was fantastic! Sorry I did not save room for desert.  Next visit."}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon.  We were skeptical as we arrived at dinner and there was only one couple in a huge place.  We tried the combo beef/chick schwarma plate for two and Athena Salad with chick kabobs.  Fresh pita bread was served and was tasty.  The combo plate arrived and it was huge.  It had a salad included which the waitress failed to mention.  it was overkill to order to other salad.  Wished we had known about the salad and we would have ordered Dolmas or something else.  The waitress came to advise us that they were out of the  usual dressing (Huh???)  and we choose a lemon and olive oil dressing.  The salad was drenched and swimming in dressing.  The chicken schwarma and kebobs were delicious.  The beef was a bit dry.  Hummus was fresh but I've tasted better.  Rice was typical.    Another couple came in midway through our meal and they were seated a table away from us even though the place was empty.  We heard them order the cheese plate and ask what type of cheeses were offered.  The waitress did not know and asked the chef.  The reply was feta and \"some assorted cheeses\" because he didn't really know.  Whaaat???  I would try it again only with a coupon."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from them last night and all I can say is \"woooow\". This has been an eye opening exerience and a real treat. I may just convert to Islam if all of their food is as good as Mijana's take on Lebanese! jk jk  In all reality, my husband and I were sufficiently pleased with our order and will definitely be ordering from them again!  ORDER:  Chicken Shawarma Platter: 5/5 - Hubby ordered this and hoooooly God er... Allah, this... This was fantastic. I stole a bit off his plate in order to satisfy my curiosity because I'm a Shawarma nut and am trying to find awesome shawarma to lure my Israeli friend out to the desert from New York with. This might just do it. There's definitely a bit of a kick with it and it's sincerely tasty. Hubby was extremely happy  Lentil Soup: 3/5 - Arrived cold and was a little on the bland side. Nothing a microwave and salt couldn't fix Love the cheese in it. Very interesting.  Greek Salad: 5/5 - YUUUUUUM!!! They LOADED it with feta and tons of dressing and a huge amount of veggies. They definitely didn't skimp on their salad unlike most places!   Kofta Kebab: 4/5 - This is something I've never tried before. Anywhere.... But I seriously appreciated the spice notes and juiciness of this grilled treat. It went GREAT with the sauce and the rice... Lord have mercy I may need to trade in my southern roots for more of this lemon spice rice.   Baklava: 5/5 - So amazing. Love the tons of crushed pistachios on this AND these were FREE!!!  Pitas: 5/5 - Woooow open them up for a perfect pocket to stuff your noms in.  Service: 5/5 - Super fast and the driver as a real doll.    All in all? 5/5 and I WILL be going back!"}
{"text":"Good food, lousy service. The employees are nice (at least the ones I met), but if you come here be prepared to 1) not have your food for an hour and, 2) drink very slowly as you will get a refill maybe once.  What was so weird about the service is that the place was practically empty and it STILL took forever. Later it filled to the brim as there was a belly dance performance, but the service stayed the same from the full hour of emptiness to the hour of being packed.  Mijana seems to rely on the other things it does (like the belly dances) for people to come in because the food, while good, was not good enough to justify the prices they charge nor get the incredibly slow service they provide.  Essentially, if you're going just for the food, there are better options."}
{"text":"To put it succinctly, the service at Mijana bordered on the comically absurd.    Before weaving this narrative, I will disclaim that it blows my mind that after years of being in business (and countless reviews attesting to the sub-par service) that there has been little to no improvement in that department.  Our party arrived for \"International Night\" at 7p on a Sunday night.  (The second Sunday of each month this restaurant hosts a few performers/acts from varying parts of the world.  Tonight we got to enjoy Brazilian Samba, Egyptian Bellydance, and Spanish Flamenco.  The entertainment was wonderful!  Upon our arrival, the restaurant was less than half empty.  I noticed three servers and the manager/owner in attendance.  As we were seated we immediately asked for a high chair for our toddler.  That high chair arrived about an hour and a half later.   It probably took 15 minutes before we received menus.  No drink orders were taken, no waters brought to the table  (They arrived about a half hour later).  We had been seated for about twenty minutes before I flagged down a server and asked if we could order.  Her reply was, \"she has not come, yet?\" and took off to find our server.  When our gal arrived, there were no apologies or explanations.  We pre-empted our order with the disclaimer that we were all very hungry and wanted to order right away.  So our orders were finally placed after we had been at the restaurant for nearly thirty minutes.  The beer I ordered never arrived, but I had to get up and let the server know once my third appetizer plate came to the table.  No apologies.  I ordered seven hot appetizers.  The first three arrived about thirty minutes after they were ordered.  The Quail, Fatayer, and Foul Moudamas.  Quail (sautéed over hummus): Perfect portion for one person, absolutely flavorful and delicious.  Crisp and spicy/sweet on the outside, juicy and flavorful on the inside.  Fatayer (four spinach pies with onions, sumac, and line nuts): Nothing to rave  about, basically a lackluster version of Spanakopita without the feta.  Foul Moudamas (fava beans cooked with garlic and lemon juice, topped fresh diced tomatoes, cilantro with drizzle of olive oil): Loved this, fresh and packed with flavor.  I had to get up and get more bread for our dips, as server was nowhere to be seen.  I had to constantly clear the table of plates as no one came to the table to do so.  At one point, about an hour and fifteen minutes after we arrived, the owner came to the table to ask how the food was  (the music was so loud I was virtually screaming at him and I barely heard him).  I handed him a stack of plates that I was just clearing from the table and mentioned how the food tasted great, but we were all still hungry...hint hint.  The server never came to follow up on our food, to ask if we wanted refills, or just to see how everyone was doing.  Around 8:30p, one hour after our orders were placed, I had to once again get up and find the server to ask about the remaining dishes I ordered.  At that time she informed me that they were out of two of the appetizers I ordered.  No Sambusek, no Makanek.  No apologies.  Fine, but the appropriate thing to do would have been to come to the table and inform us about this, and offer something else instead.  Long story short, she mentioned that my Chicken Shawarma Hummus was on its way, more than an hour after I ordered it.  The final appetizer I ordered, would arrive an hour and fifteen minutes after order was placed.  Hummus Shawarma (chicken over hummus with pine nuts) My favorite dish of the night, tasted exactly like Pita Jungle's version  (Just costs more).  The chicken was outstanding.  Soft, succulent, and savory.    Garlic shrimp (sautéed shrimp in garlic cilantro)  Second favorite dish.  Generous portion of gorgeously plump prawns, well seasoned and very flavorsome.  We snickered collectively when the hostess of the evening announced that the entertainment was coming to a close, and that there would be Samba lessons.  I quote, \"I hope that your food has settled so you can enjoy some dancing lessons.\"  Everyone's entrees literally arrived an hour after we had come to the restaurant, right when the hostess opened up the dance floor for some lessons.  The music was so loud that I had to stuff mine and baby's ears with tissue - we were literally yelling in each other's ears so we could hear one another.  Our sweet baby had an amazing time, though!  She loved the music and the dancers and was captivated the entire time.  We were so lucky to have the entertainment to keep our minds off our growling (roaring) bellies.  Our bill arrived close to 9p, after I once again made the journey to find our server and request the bill.  No thank you's,  no smiles, no apologies from her.    However, I would love to return for future International nights.  I will likely sit at the bar with no expectations of food or service - maybe a cocktail and some shisha."}
{"text":"First time in Az and bought a groupon for me and my family to dine. Upon entering there was only 1 other family but not disappointed because it was a Tuesday evening and I knew the staff would be attentive. We ordered the mijana grill for 2 with a side of Babaghanouj, the bread was a hit at our table and the food was really tasty. Unfortunately there was no live entertainment, they told us it was only on Friday and Saturday but next time I am in AZ I will be sure to come back and have an amazing dinner here again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food was great. It took a bit too long to get our food but it was worth the wait plus the belly dancer kept us entertained."}
{"text":"Excited a Groupon was available and after last experience, expected great things.  Was informed at the end of our meal the arayiss was no longer included in the Mijana Grill for 2 even though their website and menu had it, was told there were menu changes.....surprisingly after they saw the Groupon......disappointed..."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty, definitely took care of a craving. It could have been spiced slightly more, but was very good. The garlic butter/paste that came with the meal was amazing! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is a decent middle eastern place (Lebanese I believe), but I have a few problems that keep me from coming back regularly.  * the place is a little dumpy. I'm typically OK with kitschy furnishings if the building is a small space or a dive bar, but this is trying to look nice and really only coming across as cheap.  * the food is OK - but everything on the menu is a little too fried.  * their portions are always huge. If you like taking food home, this is great; otherwise, you'll either eat way too much or waste food.  * their service is pretty dang slow. I always get the feeling that they'll come around to me when they want to. I think most of the staff are family, which may explain the complacency.   The pros are that is has:  * other than the fried stuff, the food is very good * good location, and next to a hookah lounge * authentic cuisine  Give it a whirl, but keep the expectations down. Also make sure you have lots of time on your hands, because they certainly do."}
{"text":"Had the gyro, chicken shawarma, and the lamb so far. All of it is amazing!!! By far my favorite place!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy myself when I come here I typically get hookah next door but I always try to get an appetizer or dessert or some tea from the the Mijana Side. They never fail to impress me!"}
{"text":"Came back here for Eid with my family, and being such a normal customer I was expecting the food to be as stellar as usual. Unfortunately it wasn't that, at all. The kibbeh was cold inside(as if it was frozen then nuked in the microwave). The beef shawarma was burnt, the fatooush didnt have any salt in it. The chicken shawarma was stale, and the garlic dip had no hint of garlic in it. Truly depressing, and I looked like a fool talking so highly about this place. To let them serve us all of this \"food\" was unfortunate,  it makes lebanese cuisine look bad."}
{"text":"I went to Mijana for the first time because it was down the street from my apartment and it was fantastic! They have authentic Lebanese food and the Kanafe was amazing dessert! I had the chicken shwarma which is like a gyro."}
{"text":"Great place to get solid Lebanese food every time.  Fattouch, hummus, mananek are my favorite. You can also get authentic Lebanese beer and wine. If your thinking about it, do it :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great music, great atmosphere, excellent family place for dinner, gathering of friends and much more.  Thank you for always taking care of us!"}
{"text":"Decided to drive out to Tempe to try Mijana after getting a coupon and that we all love Lebanese/Greek food. Went there on a Friday night with our toddler son. It was quite busy and they let us know food was 45 minutes out. Not a problem. We ordered apps which came timely along with their hot bread. Then we see things happening...there is belly dancing on the weekends that we didn't know about. It went on until well after we got our food and our son was mesmerized by it. Didn't complain once about being in the high chair for almost an hour but kept his focus on the dancer. And he ate a lot!  All the food we had was amazing (we shared a platter for 2) along with the Tzaiki app (best I've had and it was so fresh) and the hummus app (amazing). When we were leaving they were moving tables as they have Salsa dancing too!  We will definitely return for the food and entertainment. The only downside was the wait for the check and to go boxes after finishing."}
{"text":"Good Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food. Authentic vibe and feel to this place. From the stage, it appears there is live entertainment some nights although not much was going on the night I visited. It was quiet and easy to have a conversation.  Definitely ask for the \"pillowy\" bread--it's delish. It's a little pricey but they offer Groupons from time to time.  Just make sure you buy the correct one (lunch or dinner), as they strictly enforce this.   The food is very mellow on spices and features a lot of saffron and humus, grilled kabobs, yogurt sauces, etc."}
{"text":"Three stars for food and dance only !!! Service sloooow and not great like they don't have enough on staff !! It's sooo freakin hot in there soo uncomfortable the whole table noticed how hot it was not one fan on why???? Service can't deal had to wait forever for food bill , water etc . The food was decent the dancing music good . But I wasn't to impressed with anything else . Not my fav Mediterranean place ."}
{"text":"If you enjoy ethnic cuisine you must try this place. The service was very attentive and friendly despite taking place on a Saturday evening. The food was delicious and portions were large. Wife and I shared the traditional hummus which came with tahini sauce and homemade pita. It was delicious. We then enjoyed kibbe which is fried beef croquette with beef, pine nuts and onions. OMG! You need to try it.We had their moussaka which is eggplant, zucchini, potatoes,  chickpeas cooked in tomato sauce and served over balsamic rice. Again, really delicious.  Treat yourself by going here."}
{"text":"Came here for the knafeh, but ended up ordering food because we were hungry. I got half cheese half zaatar manaqeesh which was fine, but if I knew that they brought bread and zaatar as a starter, I wouldn't have ordered it. Too much bread! Next time I'll get the fattoush salad, or falafel. I got a free hummus from checking in on Yelp, which is always a plus.   I've passed by this place so many times and it's funny that it took so long for me to stop in. Maybe it was the hookah place next door that deterred me since I thought it was in the same building. It's got a nice atmosphere, bigger than I thought with lots of seating. The night we went (Thursday) had a tango class going on, which was interesting. The owner was welcoming and our waitress was friendly and great at her job. It did take us some time to get our check. I'd like to come back and try their other menu items."}
{"text":"We were seated very quickly and our waitress was friendly and attentive. I was surprised how empty the restaurant was, but understood once we got our food because it was not good. The meat was very dry, the salad was not fresh, but the hummus was excellent. I would not recommend this place unless you were just going for the hummus."}
{"text":"I admit I was brought here by Groupon and a friend who was \"pining\" for middle eastern fare. I became concerned when I realized that the hookah shop was attached to the restaurant, and all the wait staff and cooks were wearing hookah T shirts. I am not a huge fan of the hookah but I have friends who are and depending what you hookah, you may or may not be able to do your job well. The waitress, who was scarce though there were only six patrons in the place, recommended the schwarma. I got the beef, friend ate the chicken. Sorry, but ugh. The tabouleh was 99% gritty parsley. So bitter hard to eat. Mine was not much more than little pieces of stir-fried meat with no flavor, then some no flavor rice. The reason for the two stars is the bread, pita style, that came with the hummus which was good. I could have been happy with just that. Wish I had. Then the poor service and the waitress who added 9$ to our check and when we showed her the discrepancy, said \"just give me what you owe me\". instead of recalculating which tells me: either she can't add, doesn't care, or has been to the hookah shop. My advice, skip this go for the hookah..."}
{"text":"I just returned from my second visit to this exotic Middle Eastern paradise in good old North Tempe. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed, but I was thrilled.  I was reluctant to visit despite its location right across the street from me. What finally won me over is that I attended an Eastern Catholic event in Phoenix and met a Maronite priest from St. Joseph. In perusing an anniversary celebration program, I noticed Mijana had catered and I asked him if the owners were Maronite too. It turned out that some of the owners/employees were standing right there and they invited me to a party that week. Well, I didn't go to the party but I resolved to try them out, as I am Roman Catholic and I like giving business to fellow Catholics.  The most important thing to know about Mijana is that it is an unmitigated BARGAIN. Now this is not the cheapest restaurant in town, but considering what I have paid, I have come away stuffed and very satisfied. The first time around I dropped $25 or so, but honestly $10 of that was a chick drink that I just had to try - Pomegranate Mojito. Nothing bad against chick drinks, I am a fan. It was delish. I love pomegranate in any form and this was excellent. My \"entree\" (I'm on a portion control diet) was Quail Mezza. The quail was well-roasted and pretty good for quail. It was served with hummus, and on the waitress's suggestion I also got a cup of tomato and cucumber to mix in. I enjoyed it greatly. To round out my meal and really rack up the calories, they serve complimentary freshly-baked puffy pita bread, which comes piping hot and has this great dip of zaatar, which you have to taste to believe. It's green and oily and drippy and contains sesame seeds and exotic spices. It makes the pita so excellent and savory, irresistible.  The second visit I tried some different stuff. The menu is huge, especially the bar drinks, and so you could visit for months without repeating a dish. This time around I was served by a sweet girl who seemed a little rushed, considering that she was serving three tables in an otherwise empty space. The owner helped out some and I found the service very prompt and attentive. First I ordered a Virgin Pistachio Shake. This is $6 and came out huge with a mound of whipped cream on top. This is when I decided that Mijana = BARGAIN. I love pistachio anything, and this shake was creamy and delicious and altogether more calories than I should've had in one go. But no regrets! My \"entree\" this time was another appetizer, the Sambuska mezza. These are pastries with seasoned ground beef served on a bed of lettuce and with a tzatziki style dip. I was not so impressed with the pastry shell, but the meat was savory and had some nice pine nuts in it. Tzatziki covers a multitude of sins, anyway. And of course I had more of the beloved fresh puffy complimentary pita to round out my meal.  After I ate, I quizzed the waitress a little bit on the dancing available, because for a year now I have been an avid ballroom and Latin dancer. They have Tango on Thursdays and Salsa on Friday nights. A nominal cover charge gets you in, gets you a lesson, and gets you hours of social dancing. When I live right across the street, what could be better?  I still need to explore their menu some to find my all-time favorite dish. I may have to depart from the Mezza offerings and try a dinner sometime, or better yet, go for lunch when the prices are lower. I wouldn't mind trying the lamb shank or other exotic type of meat dish. With drinks and free pita like this, no meal can be a disappointment. And I haven't mentioned the ambiance. It is mysterious and exotic and intimate. There is Lebanese pop playing on the PA, low colored mood lighting and a cozy, family atmosphere here. You really get your money's worth. So come out and try it today!"}
{"text":"We've been coming for happy hours and dinners for a while now, not sure why I didn't think to write a review earlier! My boyfriend loves to come for the hookah- to get drinks AND hookah you have to sit outside on the patio, which isn't ideal during summertime, but nice throughout the rest of the year! The servers are very attentive to the hookahs, frequently coming by to make sure it's working well and fixing the coals. The food is good and reasonably priced- we love getting the cold sampler platter of baba ganoush, hummus and tabbouli. The bread is freshly made and comes out warm and delicious! We don't salsa but if that's your thing the place gets packed on Latin night."}
{"text":"Went today to a cooking class that we bought from Groupon. The food was great and to be honest, I look forward to trying what we learned at home. Our waitress was good. My problem was the lack of hospitality from the owner and the chef teaching the class. It was really a turn off. For that reason, I would not recommend this class."}
{"text":"Good food and good service! Everyone was friendly and helpful and the belly dancer was very entertaining!"}
{"text":"Went here because we bought the living social deal. This place was AMAZING!  My husband and I shared the schwarma combo and it was more than enough food. Everything about the combo was fantastic and extremely flavorful. I like extra cucumbers, so I ordered the side of tomatoes and cucumbers, which made the meal just perfect for me. I also ordered the mango smoothie with amaretto. It was served in a tall glass  and you can bet it was empty by the time I was done. You will be so happy you tried this place! I even enjoyed the music and atmosphere on a Friday night  ((Good Friday). We missed the belly dancing at 730, but we were done eating by 845, and the restaurant was just starting to pick up because they were having salsa dancing lessons later!"}
{"text":"I came here to give it another try but failed again....One star for great customer service ... One star for Bread and hummus..I ordered something in the menu they don't have it. Please dont put anything in your menu if you dont have it.... Chicken is ok and beef extra dryyyy....And Please clean your restroom ....."}
{"text":"Great, great place! We met the owner and his son Trevor, both very nice people. Can't wait to come back!! Great people, great food, and Thursday-Saturday has shows and dancers :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this restaurant very frequently, and last night was an exceptionally bad experience. You can see my previous five star review below. The plate that we always share, was at least one third smaller than usual, with less rice, less salad, and half as much chicken. The waitress, Loni, was blunt in speech and didn't appear to know how to speak to a customer or resolve any issues. My husband found a long black hair in his mouth, after taking a bite of rice, and when mentioned to Loni, instead of saying sorry she instead asked 'where?' We hadn't asked for a discount or a comp, we just wanted to bring it to her attention. We have ALWAYS had a great experience at Mijana. This time, it felt like all of the newer, under trained employees were running the show and doing a very VERY poor job at it.    ---previous review---I cannot even believe how delicious this food was! I stumbled across this restaurant on Groupon, wandered in, expecting some sub par Persian and got a five star meal! This food, even being thirty minutes til closing, was FRESH, FLAVORFUL, and absolutely mouthwateringly good. The waitress, Lina, was sweet and professional, as well as informative about the restaurant even though she had only been employees there for a few months. She was a spectacular staff member. Mijana has gotten two new lifelong diners. Very impressed! -on a side note, I got the mixed grill for one and was served tender, juicy kabob meat and kofta with rice and salad. The pita was also freshly made and piping hot and fluffy. PERFECT!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Mijana, at any Lebanese restaurant actually. All four of us ordered different appetizers, meals, drinks, and desserts. Every single item was delicious! Our server had a sense of humor, proven when I ordered an alcoholic drink (Figs & Kisses) and she said, \"We don't sell alcohol until 5\". I must have looked either startled or dumb founded because she started grinning. I knew then we were going to like Mijana. Some items on our table: cheese borek (appetizer), zatar & bread (hot & fresh from the oven), chicken kebab (it's at least 3 meals!), Beirut nights (dessert), and jallab (non-alcoholic drink). After the desserts, we pushed back from the table, smiles & sighs of contentment from us all."}
{"text":"We don't head to Tempe that often and frankly, since it's where our tax accountant is, it's not always a good experience. When we do go, lunch or dinner at Mijana is always the highlight of our day! The Baba Ganouj  ( it's sorta like hummus but made with eggplant) is to die for. My favorite thing on the menu,  I swear I am not going to order it as an appetizer, but I always do. You can see staff baking the bread and when the basket of warm pita arrives with this delectable dip I eat it all-- every crumb. Then, of course, my meal arrives and I am already stuffed. Unfortunately, I did the same last week. I was able to eat half my beef kabob plate. The meat was-melt-in-your-mouth tender. The rice was perfection. I loved the salad with a light lemony dressing. My husband ate part of his chicken and we brought the remainder home (along with an extra order of the Baba Ganouj). Even the remaining salad was good the next day. Pig that I am, I put the Baba Ganouj on an English muffin for breakfast, had it on pita with the meal leftovers for lunch and finished it with dinner. Yes, I did use a spoon to get the last tiny bit out of the container! We have always had great service and (Kathy?) took excellent care of us on this occasion. i just wish this place was closer to home."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent. Food is authentic--like Siti made!  Thoughtfully prepared. Extensive menu. Beautifully presented. Service is skilled and friendly. Crowd was mixed--date night, families, single diners--all made to feel welcome. We had a mix--lovely dolmas, lemony hummus, babaganoush (best ever--smokey and flavorful), grilled chicken kabobs--tender inside and crispy outside--fresh bread with sesame spread and pickles--oh my. Brought home leftovers and they were gone this morning by 9 am. Called for reservations mid afternoon and left a message that was returned by owner within an hour. He made rounds of all the tables, checking on food and service--friendly and welcoming. The best."}
{"text":"Gave this place a 2 star review last time. A friend that took me before, asked me to give it another try and what a mistake! The two items I liked the first time (hummus and tabouleh), were horrible. This is why I canceled my Living Social deal after I wemt the first time. The hummus was heavy as peanut butter and not creamy and smooth. The tabouleh as though parsley was pulled from the stems and thrown in, but not processed. Maybe they don't like African-Americans. Read the other reviews and decide. I was treated to dinner here twice by a friend, but it wasn't a treat. More like a sentence. I'm out for good!"}
{"text":"Our sever Zaya was fastastic and friendly.  He brought made a great recommendation on mixed grill chicken, steak, and lamb, rice, and salad. Great tasting food, wonderful atmosphere, and would definitely come back.   On Thursday nights their is Tango dancing which so much fun."}
{"text":"Excellent food and huge portions. We had beef and lamb kabobs, and the Chicken Biryani (which was spicy), and Greek salad. Really impressive mix of complementary flavours and seasonings. We all had plenty to take home for at least another meal each. The zaatar is much thicker than I am used to, and just a little bland than the home made zaatar I'm used to. That's just a personal preference though.   We were finishing when the belly dancing performance began, which was fun to watch but quite loud.   The only loss of a star came from the service. While our server was attentive enough, she was indifferent most of the time, and had a few moments that seemed to be a combo of laziness and irritation (clearing plates, the process of collecting packaging for us to wrap up our leftovers). Also, despite the loud music when we had trouble hearing her, she only once moved so we could hear her better. The rest of the time we had to speak loudly up at her. This place is right near ASU, so their staff looks mostly like college kids, so no surprise she wasn't more friendly and engaging. Besides, it is a Friday night, maybe she was just annoyed at working instead of getting to go out.   Last, they do not have hookah, so there is none inside (yay!). But, people to rent them from a place in the same plaza and smoke on their patio, which is next to their front door and parking. So if the smoke bothers you be prepared to hold your breath for a minute on your way in and out."}
{"text":"Mijana has great Mediterranean food! I also enjoyed the experience of being at the restaurant, there was a belly dancer who was fun to watch. I had take out once and it was good, but I highly recommend dining in if you are going to eat here. They serve fresh pita the entire time you are there! I think it's worth it, but a little too pricey for me to enjoy frequently."}
{"text":"This is one of the few times we had gone to a new restaurant and failed to take photos of the amazing food.  Will have to do it on the next trip.  This was a first for me, trying Lebanese food. We had come in on a slower night and we sat where we wanted. The server took our drink orders. I opted for a Lebanese beer, Almaza that paired well with our meal. We ordered the humus and it was brought it with what looked like a pita however was slightly different, not really sure what its really called. This went well with the soup we asked for, one order of their version of chicken noodle and vegetable, and one of the lentil. All was great.  For the main course we had shish tawouk and paella. Both dishes we've had before and I was waiting to see how this place did the paella seeing as its traditionally thought of a Spanish dish. Some quick researched revealed that Spanish food historian Lourdes March notes that the dish \"symbolizes the union and heritage of two important cultures, the Roman, which gives us the utensil and the Arab which brought us the basic food of humanity for centuries.\" So now I know.  Enough history, and on to the food. The chicken kebabs were marinated perfectly and cooked with some awesome spices. The paella came with shrimp and mussels cooked with garlic, parsley and what I believe was saffron rice, all to perfection. An order of baklava finished off the meal. I've had better baklava in the past, however this wasn't bad at all. We will be back to try other dishes soon."}
{"text":"Order bottled water, their tap is really, really bad. When we ordered, we pointed on the menu and double confirmed the size and prices of the dishes. We ordered a couple sides and were just wondering how long it took to get them out. But the food was so good and a lot that we overlooked that. The Caesar salad was a waste thought. Only a couple tomatoes and the rest was greens for 20 Bucks! The surprise came with the check, as the waitress put all our little sides as Appetizers. So we ordered and payed way more than we wanted and everything she said was, that she thought this was better for us because the sides are really small..."}
{"text":"This rating is based on having the buffet and a sangria. Wanted to get the buffet in order to sample a little bit of several things the restaurant offers. Wasn't sure what everything was, but nearly everything was delicious. This was an impromptu dinner out with the girls, and one of us ordered the grill chicken kebab (I think)....this was some of the juciest, most delicious chicken ever! They were starting free salsa lessons as we were finishing up, and we're thinking about going returning just for the drinks and the salsa lessons. Oh, and not to forget the pita bread. It is so fresh and delicious! If you barely like sangrias, make sure to order theirs. This is how a sangria should be made. Wonderful and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"1st timer on lebanese food here! I really liked the atmosphere, this was a wed. night & we were the ONLY ones there, its a nice big place, service was great. I recommend the hummus app. its really good and u get plenty for 2 maybe even 3! The food was ok, both our entree's (something with chicken) seemed to have some dry chicken, I wish it was better i really wanted to like this place more, maybe its just lebanese food? I will give it 1 more try."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for this place on a whim the night before. Twenty dollars of Lebanese food for ten dollars? Yes please!  I wasn't sure what to expect. We went for lunch, which must be their slow time. The ambience is definitely more for a nighttime group outing. There's a sound stage and posters for belly dancing and tango. Also, the hookah lounge next door seems to be at least brothers with this restaurant. I was deforest underdressed had I gone for dinner.   Maybe because the empty restaurant, the staff (possibly the family that owns Mijana?) was very attentive. The handmade fluffy pita kept coming, which was good, because it took two of us three rounds of bread to finish off the hummus, babaghanouj, and tabbouleh plate. I ordered the lentil soup, which just tasted like autumn (that's a GREAT thing). My boyfriend had no complaints about the beef shawarma plate. I wish I had had room for some baklava for dessert!  4/5 stars: I'd like to see if this amazing food and service is kept up at night."}
{"text":"Second time here in 2 weeks! First time was lunch, now dinner - sooo good! We split the lentil and beet salad - HUGE and delish!! Enough to then take home! The red sangria may be the best I've ever had! Not too sweet! Wanted to see the belly dancers but we were way too early! Oh well, next time!!"}
{"text":"Pros:  $5 Mojito (Drink Special)  Free entertainment (Bollywood Night)   Cons: Bland food  Poor service  Our server admittedly forgot about us a couple times. \"Oops, I forgot to bring you ____.\" (Insert multiple requests)   I like the hummus better at Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Mijana since I love Lebanese food! When I arrived on a tuesday night around 7pm it was not busy but the atmosphere was very comfortable and welcoming. I was seated right away my hostess who was very nice. I ordered a couple different dishes including the cheese platter and Beirut special which were all delicious. When I was done with dinner this is where I have dropped my rating from 4 stars to three... the service at the end was really bad. By the time I was done there were only me at my table and two people hanging out at the bar. I waited about 25 minutes sitting looking around for my waitress. .. really??!!! I left at about 840pm but was done with my meal at 8. I eventually got up and walked over to the kitchen and asked for a to go box. The very sweet man making fresh pita bread helped me. That's when my waitress remembered that I was still there. .. All in all it was good atmosphere, good food, nice staff but I will not be back soon to dine by myself again."}
{"text":"3 stars = A-OK, but for the prices here the food should be quite superior, in my opinion.  For example, the kofta plate is $13.95 at Mijana, and at Pita House it is $14, but the kebab, the salad and the rice were all more flavorful at Pita House.  The filet mignon kebab is $19.95 at Mijana, while it is $16.95 at Tasty Kabob in Tempe, and I know for sure the latter is fantastic.  Hummus is $5.95 at Mijana, but just $4.50 at the wonderful Sahara which has been in Tempe for two decades.  Service:  the wait staff at Mijana was very attentive.  Ambience:  we arrived on a Sunday night around 8pm and a DJ was playing loud reggae; it was hard to talk.  There was a cover charge if you were there to see the DJ (we weren't), so clearly Mijana is not quite sure if it wants to be a restaurant or a night club."}
{"text":"Food was amazing but service was lacking. We waited forever just to get menus. Then forever for water. People were seated beside us 15 min after us and they got everything before we did. Ordered an appetizer it came with our food. Only 2 pitas provided for entire meal and we ordered the vegetarian platter. But..... Food is amazing. It is so authentic and is worth the price. It came out fast and was so good. If you're not a stickler on service, you have to come and try the food. The cooks deserve your service even if the wait staff does not."}
{"text":"I went here with my Wife and my Sister and her spouse. I loved the atmosphere! Live Music! I had the Chicken Kabob Wrap! Really awesome! Also had some appetizers which right now i can't remember what they were, but they were good as well! didn't get a chance to see those belly dancers my sister was talking so highly of..lol It was not as busy on this night that we went which was a Saturday. I really enjoyed myself, we want to go back to see some belly dancing next time! I highly recommend this restaurant for whoever likes to relax and have a good time, and try something new every so often."}
{"text":"A friend invited me out to their belly dancing show on a Friday night, so off we went. There was the option of the dinner buffet or ordering off of the menu, but I wasn't too hungry so I just got an order of pita bread and hummus. For our group of 6 people, service was off and on. After we got our food, I don't think our server came by until we were ready for the check. The pita was okaaaaaaay, have had better. The show was great though, and everyone else's food looked and smelled really good so I'd definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the entrees, but the appetizers were great. The restaurant environment is welcoming, traditional, and beautiful! I enjoyed my time there!!  Thanks for the service!!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go. Tasty Mediterranean Food.  You should try the lebanese beer Almaza.  Will go again :D"}
{"text":"Best pita bread and zatar. Excellent food. Our first waitress was not very attentive and not friendly. The  second one that took over was much better. Good entertainment too."}
{"text":"They have some of the best middle eastern food I've tried in the valley.  Try the schwarama plate (for two), and you won't be disappointed.  Always fresh and well seasoned.  The only reason they don't get five stars is the slow and inattentive service.  At least 3/4 times I've eaten here, the guy who I believe is the owner has had to come out and take orders because the waitresses simply disappear for long portions at a time, and don't pay attention to the tables."}
{"text":"Food is very good once it finally arrives. Bar is sloppy when busy- but drinks were delicious. Dancing on Friday nights are very fun, even though the doorgirl was rude and firm with us  paying cover for dancing even though we were originally there for dinner. They could definitely make this a hot spot if they tweak a few things."}
{"text":"Just completed a cooking class here and loved it! The class had an instructor(Vivian) who was super entertaining and walked us through each dish. Then we got to taste each dish. Then at the end all the left overs were left out with doggie bags so we could take some of the great food home. Also Chardonnay wine was included!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is good. The service sucks. The restaurant was very empty...3 other tables.  Took a long time to take our order...longer to get our drinks.  The waiter was not a friendly guy at all. We got our bread and zartar before our sodas even came... They need training..."}
{"text":"At first had mixed feelings of how this restaurant would be. The waitress wanted to seat me at a small dark table in the back by the bar and door to the kitchen. There were plenty of seats at the front by the windows. I asked if I could sit up front and selected an open table, she reluctantly agreed.   Once seated it seemed to take awhile before she got back to me with water and a menu. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma and let her know I had a Yelp check in offering a free humus plate.  I'm glad I sat up front where it's light as the meal when served was very colorful and well presented. The yellow chicken Shawarma is served on a bed of yellow rice with a nice salad of lettuce, cucumber and tomato and some crunchy pickled vegetables. At first the Sharma seemed slightly bland but when eating along with the potent creamy garlic sauce it was very good.  The free humus plate was awesome very good humus served with a puddle of oil and a few chick peas on top along with some flaky and hot naan type bread. Very tasty and filling meal.  Make sure to check your bill if you use the free humus plate, they forgot to subtract it. This is a good place to eat. I think they could work on their service . The waitress didn't seem to want or have time to make the guests feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious Lebanese food. Great ambiance and full bar. We'll be back to catch the live music and belly dancers on Saturday night.  The buffet was a great deal with a wide selection including vegetarian options and dessert."}
{"text":"I read that the service was poor, and, my fellow Yelpers, you don't lie.  We were greeted with a generous helping of silence, followed by disbelief when my friends tried to order off the menu for lunch.  I can't take them anywhere, but it was my fault, I know that they won't do a buffet.  So, after being told that it would take a while, we were informed that the gyro would not be coming.  After that, my friends watched me enjoy the buffet, which was followed by my friend who was now on a forced diet because his gyro didn't make it and me watching friend number two eat.  The food is actually good, and I love buffets, but I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Mijana while visiting the Goodwill that just opened up in the same nondescript strip mall.  I first saw it from across the parking lot and I walked over to investigate.  There were tables set up outside and a hookah bar next door.  A poster on the window of Mijana advertised belly dancing.  It looked like a cool place and I made a mental note to check it out soon.  A few days later I found myself sitting across from my girlfriend in the spacious interior of Mijana.  This place is huge and a great deal of effort has been put into making it classy.  There is a large stage with a sound system that is superior to most of the rock clubs in this city.  When we were there a middle eastern band was tinkering around with their keyboards, stringed instruments and hand drums.  When they started paying later into our dinner I was pleasantly surprised.  They played middle eastern styled instrumental music that was not overbearing.    The food is awesome.  Pita bread is made on site and is light, warm and fluffy which is unlike the compressed dense pita that one gets at most mediterranean restaurants.  We were brought out an olive oil dip infused with herbs that went well with the pita.  For our dinner we ordered the fattouch salad, vegetarian plate and lamb kabob.  The fattouch salad was amazing with its' lemony tart dressing and crispy pita pieces.  My dining companion commented that it may have been a bit salty, but it did not detract from the salad at all.  The vegetarian plate was composed of falafel, hummus, tabouli, baba ganoush, dolmades, salad and a block of feta.  I think that the quality of hummus is always a good indicator of what the rest of the food will be like.  I dived right in with my pita and was impressed - it was light and creamy.  The Falafel were also excellent and tasted homemade as opposed to the mixes that other places use.   Usually I hate domades (stuffed grape leaves) - I've had too many bad ones in this town but these were really good.  Tabouli is also something that I am not usually too enthusiastic about but  Mijana's tabouli was fresh and delightful.  Everything on this plate was flavorful and made of excellent ingredients.  I've never sampled a feta so delectable.  The lamb kabobs were tender and succulent with a subtle charred taste.  I usually don't eat lamb, but this made we want to eat more of our wool bearing friends.  We really enjoyed our meal and hopefully will be back soon to check out some belly dancing.  Mijana has carved out an amazing space in this lonely strip of Tempe suburbia."}
{"text":"Here Friday nights could be noisy for you, if you hate dance and music. Food is fresh and tasty. The PITA is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice however my friends Long Island tasted watered down!! I was ignored several times when it was my friends b-day so it was an awful experience i would highly not recomend this place they are super rude and haven't even taken out food save yourself the trouble and don't even spend a cent here..."}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing food! I ordered delivery three days in a row and loved the food.  It's a bit pricey but you get what you pay for, the portions are huge! Worth paying for!   I highly recommend this place, if you haven't tried it already.  I've had the beef shwarma wrap, gyro, and chicken wings so far, delicious! The sandwich/wraps bread is also amazing which a huge difference.   Delivery folks are super nice and so is the owner."}
{"text":"Maybe I don't like this kind of food or maybe it sucked (I'm going with the latter). Ether way I'm not going back. It would have been better and cheaper to get together with family at the cousins house order a pizza and visit."}
{"text":"Sadly one star for this disaster. While service was friendly it was unhygienic and disgusting. The gentleman who sat us was wearing food prep gloves handling the menus and then the tablecloth was stained so it was a bad start...then onto the food...bread and hummus were good but the lamb chops were fatty and both the chicken and beef shawarma were flavorless as was the rice. Not surprisingly even with a huge restaurant there were only two other parties at 6:00."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Been here twice and loved it both times! Get the Shwarma platter for two or four... Plenty of food... Even enough for leftovers. The Arabic tea is delicious!! Make sure to ask to add mint to it. Boyfriend loves the pita bread. I'm gluten free, but it smells amazing! Overall a great place and we will be back! Make sure to also come on a Friday or Saturday night for the belly dancing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Arabic restaurants in Arizona. If you want good hookah and delicious food, come here! The other side called \"hookah mania\" usually has terrible service and it takes them forever to bring the food and fix the charcoal for the hookah, but the mijana side is just wonderful. Service, ambiance, food, and hookah-all terrific. My party of four ordered the mixed combo shawarma for 4 and a veggie platter and every single thing included in the platters was exceptional. They are very generous with their portions. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for excellent food, hookah, and a good time! We went on a Sunday and they weren't too busy which was great :)"}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon. I thought the service was fine. Attentive and friendly staff.  We had the mixed Shawarma dish for two. Lots of food. It was delicious with a very tasty side of hummus The pita bread was good stuff too.  There was a dancer as well. She was entertaining.   I would recommend."}
{"text":"Delish, the garlic cream dip & beef dip were outstanding. Huge portions , no room for dessert Tried them out on Groupon deal"}
{"text":"Very nice people and the food is very good!  The best gyro I ever had.  House made pita comes warmed to your table.  First time here & first time eating Lebanese food, I like it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food portions are huge! Usually get the beef sharma combo for one. It it's perfect for two hungry people.   The smoothies are great , seriously try them. The pita bread is made fresh. Everything about this restaurant is amazing. I could write a novel. The hookahs are awesome to. They serve the hookah with your food like they do back east. It's hard to find places that will do that and understand the love for how awesome it is.   Restaurant staff is always kind and awesome. I have came here for lunch. Usually can't get back to work within the lunch hour. Takes about a hour and 10 mintues ( I work at skysong). Dinner is also very good. I have been here well over 40 times. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!   I had the Lebanese Tradition combo plate that included hummus, babaganoush and tabbouli.   I have eaten a lot of authentic Lebanese food, and this is absolutely the real deal. The food is extremely fresh and well seasoned.  The freshly baked pita is out of this world, perfectly puffy, warm and yummy!    I had the lamb kabobs as well, which were quite flavorful, but a little overdone for my taste, so a tiny bit tough, but still quite enjoyable.  The next time I will specify for medium rare.     I'll be going back to try other items.  I'm looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Food not very good at all.  Buffet has a few decent cold/salad items, but hot items are all made from cheap ingredients, poorly prepared and not labeled.  They were all pretty unrecognizable, as they were all stewy like dishes, with lots of sauces and very little substance, meat or veggies.  Cheap, cheap.  Signage would be good, so people know what they are eating.  Varied menu if you do not order the buffet, but didn't enjoy anything we had, and between our large party, there were many items to taste.  Only good thing was the fresh, hot pita bread made all night. Service was slow and place is a large, empty, cold room.  Pretty dark and dirty.  No ambiance.  I won't be returning, and I love hole in the wall ethnic dives, but this one sadly sucks."}
{"text":"Yelped for buffets in the northern Tempe area and spotted this place being a short ride away...  Arrived about 7pm and they were just about to get the last few hot dishes out for the buffet. The place was fairly empty and I was greeted by the owner and a lovely hostess before being seated near a window. The atmosphere was looking good and you can tell this place can go nuts with the dancer's and music other yelpers mention.  The buffet had a full line-up of Mediterranean cold dips (Tzatziki,  Babaganoush, Hummus, etc..) to accompany a salad bar, and another section for very flavorful hot dishes such as eggplant, roasted chicken legs/wings, meatballs with peppers/onions/potatoes, aromatic lamb shank on rice, cous-cous, rice with lentils, and a tasty vegetable tomato-based stew. For dessert I tried a sort of cold pudding that was adorned with crushed pistachios - very tasty!  Very happy with the meal here (any buffet with lamb has my vote), but I might hold off until a special event night where I can entertain a date or party for the $16 price tag. I would also suggest coming in early on a slow night as the owner would have little reason to keep everything topped up with an empty house (and the lamb goes fast!)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The food was hot, fresh and cooked perfectly. Will definitely come back on a Saturday to eat and enjoy the Belly Dancing entertainers. This is one thing I love about Groupon you get the opportunity to find out about different places you may not have ever known about."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here and there was a tango lesson happening. We started with jalapeño hummus, then had the chicken and vegetable soup and then had chicken skewer plate and vegetarian plate. Everything was so fresh, so amazing, and the atmosphere was super fun and lively.  We took home our food and ate it for breakfast in our hotel room the next morning because it was so good we couldn't resist. Seriously delish and highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is an amazing Lebanese restaurant. The food is authentic.    It feels like a place you would find in Lebanon. They're kefta kebab and hummus is the best. Looking forward to going back. To top it off they also have fresh pita bread and the desserts are homemade.  Looking forward to going back with my family and friends. They also have belly dancing on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and hookah is really Friday nights are the best and the music is good just very chill and relaxing"}
{"text":"This is an updated review which I will update again if I choose to give this place another chance and they do better on a future visit. I visited here before for a cooking demo which was awesome. We got to try the food which was absolutely fantastic and it was a great time in every sense so of course I had to come and enjoy dinner here. So, visited for a Friday night date night and we were sat close to the front door (also the door that leads to outside seating area). We'd just missed the belly dancing and we were bummed about that but couldn't wait to try their food because I LOVE Lebanese food. Looked over their extensive menu and decided but had a few questions. No one came to us to take our order although someone did come by with waters. Apparently the owner took our order since he saw us looking around. We learned you cannot substitute anything on the menu (at all). I don't like eggplant so simply wanted more hummus on the veggie platter but had to get separate appetizers as my meal instead. My partner didn't want rice with her meal but had to get it anyways since it came with it. OK fine, now we know for the future. The food came pretty quickly but we had no idea who our server was since no one introduced themselves to the table. If we needed anything like more water, sauce, napkins we asked the server who was taking care of the table next to us. Unfortunately she wasn't very good and turned out that she was our server as well. We only found out when we had to ask for the check and boxes. It was not an enjoyable or relaxing meal either because all the tables in the center of the dining area were being moved since they had salsa dancing on Friday nights. This was around 8:20pm or so and we were like I said, by the front door where all the tables were being moved. Definitely not a relaxing or enjoyable experience for us. Might go again for lunch during the week when it's slower and no tables are being moved around. Be forewarned if you visit on a Friday night and are looking for an intimate experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a taste for Turkish food and Mijana came up on our google search. The food was good. We will go there again."}
{"text":"Was delicious.  I got delivery so I cant speak for the service or the atmosphere but the food was phenomenal. This was my first time trying Lebanese food and I enjoyed it. The pita bread and hummus are some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"We had a GrubHub delivery tonight. Hummus and (yay for warm bread) pita bread are  excellent. Enjoyed the Cheese Borek & Fatayer Mezza. Timely delivery. LOVE the delivery guy! Definitely will order again and/or go visit in person. A+++"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Lebanese cuisine and it was a great place to have my first experience. Hands down, the hummus was perfect. The others at my table agreed, we would smear the hummus on anything and everything because it is so tastey. My fiance and I shared the chicken and beef schwarma and the dish did not disappoint.  The group also had a few appetizers and they came out fresh and nicely displayed, and it was a great introduction for our meal. My favorite was the Turkish Coffee. It was divine and a true treat to have.  I will certainly visit this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"I was there for a meeting and arrived late (as usual) so I missed out on the fabulous looking buffet. BUT, I did try and have the Soup of the Day, which was lentil soup that day. Wow, what a great meal! And it was only $5! Big bowl of tasty soup that really hit the spot as the meeting was progressing and my tummy was aching for something warm and tasty. can't wait to go back and try the rest of the tasty treats."}
{"text":"By far the best Mediterranean food near the University. Their service is a little slow. They have belly dance over the weekend which is really good. The food is tasteful, mixed of spices is well crafted. The pita was fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly dropped in here. I was so surprised; Delicious food! Big portions!   Our server was lagging a little but she seemed really busy. Food made up for it."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Mijana. We were celebrating my friends birthday. Food wise it was ok with lots of vegetarian choices ( with is important for me).  Portions r big enough to share.  Going by the menu description I was really looking forward to try their vegetarian pilov with mushrooms cauliflower and eggplants but I was disappointed it was an ok dish but it wasn't a pilov. It was fried eggplant with steamed cauliflower and CANED mushrooms ( not even fried just straight from the can) topped with marinara sauces on plain rice. Disappointed .  Babaganush on the other hand was very tasty I really enjoyed it.  Red sangria was good,  we got one big one to share.  Service was a bit messy and slow, but it was a lot of people and 2 big birthday parties at the same time.  I would definitely come back to try some other vegetarian dishes. They also have a belly dancer show which we enjoyed, and after 9 pm they had salsa dance classes  So all over it was a nice place to visit with a small bumps now and then. I would recommend to try it and see for ur self."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service was great. Had the home-made pita bread with the combo appetizer which contained some of the best Babaganoush, and Dolmas I've ever had in addition to the hands down best pita bread in town. It comes hot out of the oven. Also had some sort of oil sesame seed I don't know the name of which was really good. For the main course I had the lamb shank which was nice and soft and came off the bone and onto my rice. Yummy.  The hookahs come from next door and they were good, and the coals were added regularly without having to ask for it.  Service was great with everyone checking on us regularly.  Decor isn't the greatest and has a ethnic-restaurant feel to it but I don't mind that.  Live entertainment with Lebanese music, belly dancer next door, and people dancing was pretty nice."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Groupon, if we didn't find it there we probably would have never found this hidden gem!  We order the Shawarma Combo for 3. It was so much food it could have been for a party of 4. It was a chicken and beef combo that came with hummus and garlic sauce.  The garlic sauce was unbelievably mouth watering, DELICIOUS. You dip you meat into the sauce and it gives it so much flavor.  We thought it was another type of hummus so it was just sitting there at first and then our waiter told us to eat it with our meat.  They also have a cooking class for sale on Groupon that I want to try eventually to get their recipe.  The Jalepeno Hummus was also a winner!"}
{"text":"Its really good middle eastern food. Not the quality of Haji Baba or Byblos but very good. Great service and a really fun Hookah bar next door.  Skip the Sanbusek whatever you do. Not sue what they are doing with that.  The Shwarma is very good even though they don't cook it on a spit. Which all Shwarma should be cooked on. Oh well.  I didn't like that kids were allowed in the Hookah lounge area just because it was the owners sons birthday. Tons of smoke in there and children shouldn't be in a Hookah lounge at 12am on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Great service from Marcella and the food was excellent.  Will be going back soon for Musaka and lamb shanks."}
{"text":"The food here was very good, but it was the waiter, Trevor, who earned the extra star!  I came in, with my check-in special, and he looked at it and started making suggestions.  Since this cuisine isn't something I eat every day, I was happy to follow his advice, including the fantastic Lebanese pilsner.  I would definitely come back here for the food, the beer, and most of all the service!"}
{"text":"One server, one cook, one guy making bread. Had a Groupon so didn't do the buffet. Ordered two dips and had to ask for more bread. Also had to flag down server to order drinks. A wait for our meals and not much meat that was dry and overcooked. Maybe dinner or the buffet is better but having been to that part of the world and had that food, I wasn't impressed enough to be back. My Groupon was for $40 so when I got my bill and it said a discount for less and the amount I figured I owed wasn't the same as what I was told, I asked the server. She said she couldn't help me because the owner did the bill and she couldn't fix it. Seriously? Not good!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. There were two of us. We ordered the Mijana Mezzanine, Platter of 2 kibbeh, 3 cheese borek, 4 falafel, 2 fatayer and 4 chicken wings. Then the Mixed Grill for 1 to split. Half chicken, half beef and one kofta kebab. Served over rice, salad and pickles. Lots of food. We brought quite a bit home.They make their to die for pita bread on site. Their dipping sauce is fabulous. We eat Mediterranean food often and love it. This is a bitt different. Flavors are great, potions are wonderful.  Our server Kathy was attentive and informative. We will back."}
{"text":"Wow, what a meal.  That was sooooo good.  We both ate chicken swarma and it was awesome.  Comes with a salad and rice.  Also has an awesome garlic sauce.  There is alot of food, all of it fresh.  The meal comes with freh baked pita bread.  The bread is baked right there in a brick oven.  Big, fluffy and nicely browned.  The bread comes with this dipping sauce with oregano, sumac, sesame seeds, olive oil and some other spices.  Our waitress (gastronomic tour guide) Lydia was very sweet and took the time to explain what everything was.  They also told us that some weekends they have live music and belly dancing.  This place was very much a do over for us!  Thanks Lydia and the rest of the people at Mijana."}
{"text":"Came here because I found a groupon for it and we already knew we loved middle eastern food. We ordered the Lebanese quesadillas, which taste a lot like White Castle cheeseburgers (good). We split the mixed grill for two; it was really good. They also bring out pita bread with some kind of sesame sauce on the side. I got a fig mojito which was good too. Apparently they have belly dancing on Friday and Saturday nights starting at 730 but we got there too early. Lots of food, had to take a box home. The interior is a lot nicer than I expected. This is an expensive sit-down place FYI."}
{"text":"I wanna Mijana! This is the 2nd time I've come here. I love it. The ambiance is great, the food is fantastic, & if you get here on a weekend evening you'll get a show too. Belly dancing, live band, or salsa dancing class. Everything I've ordered here has been so good that I want the recipe. Get an Arabic tea pot with fresh mint leaves. They bring out a fresh baked pita bread to enjoy and a dip that I can't even explain except to say it's delicious. The service is happy and friendly. See yourself here because this is not a place you should bypass!"}
{"text":"This place serves food with so much flavor you go away and don't want to eat anything else for days.  What a terrific blend of spice and old-time Lebanese flavoring.  I always eat the Jalapeno Hummus, with fresh bread.  The flavor in the Hummus is amazing, not too hot, but enough bite to get  your senses going.  The fresh pita bread is cooked as you wait, it's fluffy and hot and makes you yearn for the old country.        Let me tell you about the chicken vegetable soup.  It is so good, I have actually never had soup this good.  You will love it.  Served in a cream sauce, lots of chicken and an array of fresh vegetables.  Wow!  The flavors burst in your mouth, coupled with the fresh bread and Hummus, you'll want to eat more, but there will be no room."}
{"text":"This place is AWAFUL, service is really bad, i got on restaurant.com gift card for this place and when i got there they refused to take it. Food was not good at all, appetisers we got after we ate our main entree. Hostes forced us to pay $40 per person just to get in there for music, i dont know for what kinf od music we just have been there for dinner, waiter was pushing us to finish our meal, and there was girl dancing  terrible belly dance. I dont recommend this place at all!!!!"}
{"text":"\"Is there anything else we can help you with?\" We were asked this question repeatedly Friday night. Arriving for a 7:30pm reservation we had our pick of tables as there weren't many diners. Given the choice we eagerly sat in an available booth. We both sat on the cushioned seating against the wall. Given our experience I'd recommend sticking with standard chairs, for reasons you may, or may not agree with.   \"Are you ready to order?\" Belly dancing is from 7-9pm (ended earlier). A wonderful show is put on near the stage. Tables in the center part of the restaurant (and the booths) have prime viewing. As this was my first visit I fastidiously reviewed the drink menu. To my delight there was a curious mix of drinks available. Margaritas. Long Island Ice Teas. Martinis. Jägermeister - Yeah. That was on there. As a drink. Neat. Nothing quite traditional sounding so I went with wine. In the meantime a glass of water was brought out.  \"Can we help you?\" \"Are you ready to order?\"  Erm- We'd just opened the drink menus.  Not quite. I explained this was my first visit. Hoping to hear something, anything. a handout to what a mezza might be, instead I heard. \"I would recommend ordering the Mixed Grill for Two...It has mwah mwah mwah mwah\" said incredibly fast. I blinked. She said the name of another dish quickly. I blinked. And then -  \"Do you need a few more minutes?\" Yes. I suppose so.   36 seconds later - We opted to try the Vegetarian Platter (huge) as an appetizer.  Hummus, Babaghanouj, Tabbouleh, (3) Falafel and (3) Vegetarian Dolmades. That's plenty of food to share with four people. Ambitious for two.  We were granted time to deliberate our entree order a few more minutes. Instead of the Mixed Grill shared plate (which sounded interesting: skewers of Chicken Kebab, Kefta Kebob and Lamb Kebob) Lamb tempted us. Specifically Lamb Shank and Lamb Kebabs.   The menu is separated into cold and hot mezzas. We made out like bandits quickly picking what we did. The food is stellar here.  At this point we began an interesting game I'll call \"Moving of the Plates and Glasses\". We were curious what our entrees might taste like once they were dropped at the table. So we got up and moved them from the far side of the table. You know, within fork reach. Then we slid the appetizer platter out. And the bread plate. And our empty water glasses. And my wine carafe. And the empty beer bottle. (Later I had an even larger collection of glassware.)  Where did everyone go? That's ok. I was distracted by the Fred Flinstone sized portion of my true to description, falling off the bone, lamb. Honest to god, I almost died.   But then - oh - my date reached suddenly behind my head with his napkin. His expression frozen with intent. I paused in only what second date behavior in public warranted.   \"Oh? Everything ok?\" \"Uh. There was ... a .. bug.\"  (IT WAS RIGHT BY MY HAIR. In the dark.) Later I asked my date to describe the bug. It's Arizona. These things happen. He said it could have waved at me. I have little hands. It was bigger than the tip of my thumb. (Also, it apparently got away.)  I recommend stand alone seating.  FOOD The Lamb Shank shocked me in sheer size. When I poked it with my fork gingerly the meat sighed. The grilled vegetables were delightfully seasoned, grilled and layered on top of a wonderful bed of rice. I wish I had grabbed an appropriate photo of the Lamb Shank. This is a dude's platter. Not for a girl on a date!   THINGS TO KNOW + Service is hit or miss. I finally flagged down a very nice man (possibly a manager) for my 2nd glass of water.  + Salsa lessons Fri/Sat night. Lights go off. Disco balls goes on. + Baklava is bone dry and hard. It was difficult to break into bite sized pieces. We returned it.  + Turkish coffee is divine! + Time your dinner well before dance class. Service ...changed as dance class preparations began.  DANCE HERE + It's a happening spot. When I left there was a line outside the door and beefy bouncers. Inside spectator watching (almost) made the service level worth it.   + $5 Drink specials! + Friday Night Salsa is produced by AZSalsa.net \"Tumbao | Latin Fridays\". + Come dressed to impress!"}
{"text":"I have dined at Mijana three times now, each time I have to ask myself why it has taken me so long to come back. The food is without at doubt very good, fresh, flavorful and authentic, but the wait staff could use some sprucing up. Every time We have been there the wait for water refills or just to order have always taken longer than I would like, but they do have the BEST FRESH pitas! The owners/management has always been very polite, helpful and generous and on Saturday nights they sometimes have belly dancers, which adds to the over atmosphere and ambience. Portion sizes are enormous and I've left with a box full of leftovers everytime. I highly recommend the shawarma platter for 2, or the mixed grill for 2, and the Lebanese tradition as an appetizer. You cannot go wrong with their stuffed grape leaves either! The only complaint would be mediocre service, but the food is so good We come back every few months and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Great atmosphere!! Service is great...bread and dips were superb!! Food was great!!! Next time going for apps and drinks and for the belly dancing!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really great, service is awesome and the food is good. It was so much fun watching the belly dancer while waiting for our dinner and then staying after dinner for salsa dancing (I think that is just a Friday thing). I will certainly visit Mijana again. P.S. If you order the shawarma wrap, be sure to order the garlic sauce to go with it!!!"}
{"text":"So at first when I was eating the zahtar and made in house pita, I was wondering how does this place only have a 3.5???  Well after the whole meal I know why.  The zahtar and pita bread are amazing. Honestly why I decided to come back after trying this place almost a year ago. It's complementary, so it's even better. You get this amazing home made bread and zahtar, for free.   We started with the Kibbe and cheese Borek. The kibbe was good, not my taste, but I recognize it was good and tasted like it should. The cheese borek had gotten a little cold so it wasn't as enjoyable. It was like eating a Luke warm, stiff feta cheese stick.  I got the chicken shrawma wrap, and my partner got the falafel. The shwarma was good nice flavor. But the pita wrap was dripping with sauce so it was very soggy, and messy to eat. The falafel was not crispy on the outside,so it was like a bean paste almost.  But the worst part was waiting 35 minutes for the check. We weren't checked on in that time. We had our plates stacked and napkins on top of them. It got irritating trying to get the attention of the waiter.  Over all, the zahtar was the saving grace and why I wasn't too dissatisfied."}
{"text":"I've never had Lebanese food before, but a co-worker highly recommended Mijana. I was a bit hesitant, since there are so many phenomenal food choices in Tempe. The menu was easy to read, as there were photos next to the descriptions. For starters, the complementary pita bread was hot, fresh, airy and delicious. The bread went perfect with the Jalapeño hummus, which wasn't overly spicy. The kebabs in my entree were also perfect. The steak was tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. The portions were very generous and the prices were reasonable. This is a great restaurant if you want to stray a bit from your comfort zone. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The service here was horrendous.  It's not that our server was bad, it's just that she hardly ever came back, even to take our order.  Dined here on a Wednesday night and they only had 1 server....she looked like she was working as both the server and bartender.  The wait times in between her coming back to our table were ridiculous.  We were sat and she came to take our drink order....but after that, I don't think we saw her again until the end.  One of our friends had to get up and go get who looked like to be the manager or owner to take our order, because we had already waited at least 20 minutes.  We finally order and then they're out of what I ordered, and wasn't told of this until after we placed our order.  The food was only ok.  For what I paid for the lamb.....it wasn't even juicy and lacked flavor.  My boyfriend did not like his quail at all.  From the time the plate was set down it looked like it was completely dry. ...and it was.  Had absolutely no flavor or anything to it.  He was not happy at all with it....especially for the price.    This place has potential, but with the service and cost for bad to decent food....we will be visiting other places over this one."}
{"text":"Their rice is amazing! The kabobs, stew and dessert were all amazing too. I would say the rice and dessert were my favorite parts though. The dessert was a pistachio honey ice cream they make homemade on site! Absolutely phenomenal! A bit pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"My wife blindfolded me, took me for a ride and told me I was getting a surprise dinner that night. When I was unmasked, it was excited to try cuisine I never had before. I could not stop eating the fresh baked bread with the olive oil mix.  I had some kind of combination meat dish and each was cooked perfectly. Great service, reasonable prices. I think I'm going to go again this week."}
{"text":"This is an interesting Lebanese restaurant.  My wife and I went there on a Friday night.  It was a little slow.  The following are our observations:  1) Regarding the decor it is well done  2) The menu and fare does have a lot of Middle Eastern/Lebanese fare, but it is not as true to the Lebanese fare as my wife and I had hoped.    3) They had a few menu listings that were more \"Westernized\", as well as having some menu listings that were more South Asian (Indian/Pakistani) rather than Lebanese.  They had things like tilapia on the menu, as well as biriyani.  Tilapia is now farmed everywhere, but its origin is Malawi in Africa.  Biriyani is a rice and meat dish that originates from the Northern part of the Indian Subcontinent, and perhaps is Persian or Turkish origin if not Indian.  Even the way the biriyani was presented, it is quite different from what I remember eating in Delhi.  Regardless the food was good.  Just do not expect them to be like the traditional.  For the record the food that we ordered was the following:  1) Baba ghannouj (typical Lebanese) 2) a tilapia fish entree (a hybrid of Lebanese, and other things) 3) chicken biriyani (a hybrid of Lebanese, Indian, and other things)  All was good.  I have no problems with the quality.  Just do not expect the traditional Lebanese or Middle Eastern fare.  Lebanese fare is there and present, but there are things that are decidedly none Lebanese, or not only Lebanese."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of this place.  The food was decent -- not great but decent.  But not anymore.  Was there recently with my family and two things pissed me off.  Even with a food bill in excess of $150, they charged us extra for extra sauce for our meats and $2 processing fee for using a restaurant.com voucher.  This may not seem like a big deal, but little things like this make for a regrettable event."}
{"text":"We ate here a couple months ago (forgot to review then) and while the food was phenomenal, the service was mediocre. All the servers seemed very attentive to their tables but ours wasn't around much. All our cups were empty frequently and it was hard to get refills. Our server rarely checked on us and when she brought our food, she dropped the plate on one of our guests lap and feet. It made a huge mess! She quickly apologized but left us to clean up the table and mess. The belly dancers put on a fun show and we ultimately enjoyed ourselves and the food. The manager did remove the spilled from our bill which we appreciated, but just wish our server had been better. We will still be back but hopefully get a different server next time. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Great food amazing service, decent prices. Belly dancer was ok not the best but mediocre. We will definitely be going. Already have made plans to meet some friends here in few weeks"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants but it's not easily visible from Scottsdale Rd, so I worry that it won't get the attention it deserves.  The place is one giant open room with a huge amount of tables, a stage for a band, and a floor for dancing. There are three massive circular areas for parties, two of which are raised. But you could also have a party at the long tables that are in the center of the floor. There is a full-service bar.  Mijana is great for late night feasting and partying. They have Wednesday Salsa night. On other nights they have live bands and they bring in belly dancers. Men and ladies actually do get up and dance. The dance floor was packed the night we stayed there late enough for the dancing. The entertainment is scheduled to start around 9 but it doesn't usually get going until about 10, and they'll stay open as long as people want to party, usually until 1 or 2 am.  The food is amazing! This is a vegetarian's paradise, though there is plenty of meat. I'm vegan, but one of our meat-eating groups of friends that we brought loved the food. We brought a second group of meat-eaters who didn't care for the meat so much. The vegetarian plates are all amazing. From my point of view, the meat plates look rather boring, but I'm not the one to rely on for a meat review...  Our favorite dishes:   1) Moussaka - (eggplant with chickpeas, onions, green peppers, in an amazingly flavored sauce. AMAZING!  2) Eggplant Rehab - this is an eggplant dip with pita, cucumbers, and tomatoes plus other flavors. It's got a gooey texture and I hear that some Americans are turned off by the look and feel of it, but it's so flavorful. It's one of my favorites. People should get over their fear of goo and try this. Yum.  The pita is not like other pita you get at most places. It's the best. The hummus, babaganouj, falafal, and all the other vegetarian items are all so good. Vegans -- just make sure you tell them no tatsiki or feta cheese, etc.  One of the unusual things about this place is that it really doesn't start buzzing until 10 pm. At 10:00, Lebanese families start flooding in and that's when the party begins. Until about 9 or 10, you are likely to be the only people in the restaurant and if you don't know to expect it, you'll be shocked to see the place suddenly on fire after 10.  A couple other things: the owner is so friendly. He has never forgotten us since the first time we discovered his place. And the ambiance of the restaurant is great. It's very nice and there's a patio. The hookah vendor next door will even bring out the hookahs late at night on the weekends for you to smoke.  We've come for a quiet meal as a couple, we've come to party for my birthday -- and also just to party -- and we've brought our children. It's always good."}
{"text":"Don't do the cooking class, but do eat here!!   I bought a Groupon for a date night, we love to cook! However, the cooking class was not as I expected/hoped. The class was a demonstration and then serving pre made foods. There were a lot of people and we were seated in the back, in combination with their soft voices, I had no idea what was happening. We were hoping to be more interactive. They also didn't let us know when the class was \"done\", so many stayed to wait for dessert. But there was none.  However, everything we ate was AMAZING. They completely changed my opinion on eggplants. Previously I hated them and was very intimidated to try anything with eggplant in them. Their baba ganouj was fantastic with their homemade naan (also amazing). They used a hint of cinnamon in their shawarma, which was great and paired perfectly with a tart garlic sauce. I would also recommend their hummus and tabouli.  Now the desserts were by far my favorite. Baklava is one of my favorite desserts, so I may be biased. I wanted to try some new desserts and ordered creme caramel and the knafe. Both were awesome!   I would highly recommend this restaurant for eating but I would not recommend the cooking class."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Went with a couple friends and got some delicious food with freshly baked pita bread and a cold beer.   Got a hookah and chatted on the patio. Comfortable setting. Nice staff. My new favorite restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and a family favorite now that our favorite Lebanese food place closed. The food is delicious, I definitely recommended vegetarian platter. The service is very very slow though. They only had one server working, forgot our drinks and brought out our yogurt dip about 20 minutes after our courses. The food makes it worth it but don't come if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"We went here with friends last Saturday, 7/27 for the second time.  They know and are friends with the owner.  He helped us order and we got quite the spread - Beirut Special, Vegetarian Platter, Kofta kebabs, lamb shank, and makanek.  I've never liked babaghanouj before I had it at Mijana.  It was so, so, so good!  Tabbouleh was also great and pita bread with zatar was also good.   The food was fantastic, but the service left much to be desired.  The lamb shank and kebabs came out lightening fast - making me concerned about the kitchen and how prepared it was before we ordered it.  Then it was a good 15 minutes before the rest of the food came out.  We had to ask twice for the pita bread, and my water was empty more often than full.  The waitress had a \"greater than tho\" attitude and was not very friendly.    They often have live entertainment and/or dances,  Last Saturday was no exception, but the gal that danced when we first got there wasn't great.    If I could, I'd give 2 stars for service and 4 for food.  Hurray for authentic Lebanese food and an ethnic experience in what can be a rather dull and homogenic restaurant scene."}
{"text":"While visiting my dad for Thanksgiving, our entire family came here to eat one night.  It was a week night so not busy at all.  There was one girl serving (and bar tending) while a bunch of men played backgammon in the corner.  LOL.  There were 6 of us including my 9 year old daughter.  We ordered a magnum mixed grill along with a couple of other dishes to supplement the meal.  In the end, I think we have food for at least 10 people.  Everything was delicious.  The meats were more done to my liking, but still good.  The bread is phenomenal.  I would have stuff my face with several pieces, but I was saving my appetite.  I understand there is belly dancing (on the weekends?).  Maybe next time we're in town, we'll check out the entertainment."}
{"text":"I have been eating alone at Mijana for 20 years, since coming to Arizona, but ONLY with Entertainment (20 years ago, no longer buy them), Living Social, or other 50% off vouchers, which the owner is participant of many.     Most recently, I bought vouchers supposed to be used for lunch only.  Says you can purchase up to 10, so I bought 8, just for myself, because I like lamb.   In May, 2016, I told the waiter what I wanted to order, he went to place my order, then came back and apologized that Mijana got rid of their lunch menu and cheaper lunch prices.  I asked to speak to the manager because I had called earlier that day and owner told me lunch ends at 2:30, but when I got there and ordered my lunch, same lamb shank for $14.95 (lunch price) I had 2 weeks before, I was told that there is no more lunch menu.  I have to pay dinner prices.   I was so disappointed and blown away because I cannot order as much for my $20 voucher.  Manager said they did away with the lunch menu because the waiters \"the different lunch prices was so confusing for the waiters\".   I told the manager \"Wow you need to hire NEW waiters, waiters that GET it!\".   He did not agree.  Also my waiter was very new, I think it was his first day.  He did not even set my table, brought my pita and dip with no table settings, so I got utensils, napkin, and plate from another table and served myself.     I gave him a little less tip than I would have, cos he did not ever come and check on me, either.  I saw outside where there were two men at the next table, one man used the F word, every other word, and it was really disturbing to me.  I almost thought I would have to move inside, the day was so beautiful to sit outside on the patio, but that F word man also smoked.  They made my meal so much less enjoyable.  I was so relieved when the waiter brought their check and they left.   I never came across anyone who used the F word every F***ing word, and he looked late 30's or early 40's, not some young punk.  Quality varies, one time I got horrid brown-colored rice, tasted like it was put in a take out box, then put in the sun for 3 days. It was even slimy.   Server traded me for saffron rice, much better.  Another time I had spoiled vegetables.  Another time the kabob was burnt and dry and hard.  I sent it back.  I usually order the lamb shank, which does not come with any sauces, just dry.  The pita is especially good here, warm and the dish of black tahini that it is served with is one of my favorite reasons for coming to Mijana.  I give that 5 stars.    Mijana Mezza - awful, I sent it back.  The chicken wings were all dried like jerky, could not pull meat off the bones, and nothing I bit into, tasted good enough to take another bite.   It was expensive too $20, so i sent it back, and ordered my lamb shank again.  The squab was pretty good, but not much meat, and sometimes it came over cooked, like the chicken wings, dried up.  Many meats are over cooked here, I feel.    The belly dancing show starting at 7:30 is very short, maybe 20-30 min.    I will probably no longer go to Mijana, because the prices have increased, they no longer have the lunch menu (where dinner size plate can be had for much less $), and also the Living Social deals are no longer 50% off."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences at a cafe. Ordered a drink and a hookah, drink tasted horrible had to ask them to take it back. So far no big deal, but hookah came with black un-lit coals, when asked to change it as it was not hotting right, they changed it with more black un-lit coals.   We decided to leave so our night wouldn't be ruined and go somewhere else. When we told them we should not he paying as we didn't have any of the orders right, they insisted on receiving payment.  $30+ down the drain"}
{"text":"Hmmm.... last time I went it was better...  The belly dancer didnt come til after 7:30 when they were suppose to come in at 7.  The lamb shank didnt have alot of spice that I would expect from a meditarean place  The vegetarian platter had a variety of stuff, but it's just not my taste except for the hummus.    Overall, I would still come here because of the ambiance and belly dance performances while you eat for visitors."}
{"text":"Outstanding food every single time!!     Tonight they were slammed with deliveries and the owner himself made a point of driving dinner to us directly since his staff was busy delivering elsewhere.     Can't say enough great things about the food and the people!"}
{"text":"Love Mijana- home to some fabulous belly dancers and the best paella I've ever had!  Came here with girlfriends on a Saturday night and enjoyed what can only be described as a \"bevy\" of terrific dancers. We arrived at 7:30 and when we left well after 10pm, there were still new girls coming out to entertain! I love this about Mijana and I love that the women were of various ages and body types. Score for diversity!  On to the food- I ordered the hummus which was absolutely delish, and the paella which was to die for! It came with saffron rice, tomatoes, cucumbers, mussels, and shrimp. It was so so good! My only wish is that this place was closer to where I live! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We moved to the area recently and have planned to visit Mijana many times, but only made it out tonight. We arrived just after they opened for dinner, so it was pretty empty except for a birthday party by the stage area.  The waitress was attentive and had drinks and food for us very quickly. I'm a freak about hummus and make my own pretty regularly, so I know what I like. The hummus here was absolutely wonderful; a good traditional creamy hummus.  The first batch of pita that came with it was nothing special, but the second batch was wonderful. It was hard to believe these came from the same kitchen, but I'm glad we asked for more.  My wife had the lamb shank dinner and I had the Kofta kebab, and we both agreed that our meat was delicious, but the rice was spectacular. The salad that came with the meal is always like garnish to me; good but nothing special and certainly not the star of the meal.  If I have the chance I may come back for the lunch buffet, but the dinner was great, even if a little expensive. For the lamb it seems appropriate, but kofta/kefta always seems like it should be cheaper than it is.  Hummus: 5/5 Pita: 4/5 (second serving was much better) Lamb shank dinner: 5/5  Kofta kebab: 5/5  Service: 5/5 Clean: 5/5"}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery and got the baklava for dessert and got the Beirut special for the main course. The special was good to great because there was so much diversity. That baklava though was a fantastic dessert. Heck, I would order from or go there just for that... and my wife would tell you I'm not a dessert person!"}
{"text":"I love Lebanese food and have had a lot, but this restaurant is my favorite. We ordered delivery and it was fast & fresh. The tabouleh was so fresh, hummus was very flavorful and the pita bread was still warm. We will definitely be going in for the love entertainment we heard about from our friends next time we go out! Thank you Mijana!"}
{"text":"Dope place. The regulars are kind of judge-y when you eat there, for god knows what reason, but the staff and food is amazing! Can't wait to eat there again :)"}
{"text":"I have had some pretty good Lebanese food in LA, and I was expected mouth-watering flavors and the tangy flavors of the cuisine.  I think I set such high expectations, but the food was still good nonetheless.  I would have to say the hummus was delicious.  The price was pretty reasonable, but I think some of the other entrees could have been seasoned with more Mediterranean flavors."}
{"text":"So I will start off by saying this....I reserved a table for a party of 17 for my father's 70th birthday. I will say that the food was delicious and came out on time. No complaint in that department.  This review isn't so much for the food as it is for the arrangement made to celebrate my father's 70th birthday. When I called in to reserve a table 3 weeks prior, I informed the person who reserved our table? That we would like to also make sure we would be present for the main entertainment for Saturday night. After our meal it was already 10 and the music began. Management came to us and informed us that our table was reserved for another party! I was super embarrassed that I had to turn and tell our whole party that we all had to leave. They did try to accommodate another table for us, but it was smaller and wouldn't fit everyone. So most of our party left and a few stragglers stayed behind.  In my opinion, if you have two reservations for one table? Let a party know. I would've taken my business elsewhere.  We spent about 1,000 with food and drinks combined and had we stayed longer? We would've spent more. IF THERE WAS a time frame per table? They should've informed us when we first called to reserve so we could've planned our evening accordingly.   Other than that, the food was really good. Again, no complaint on food. Just the way the night was handled. that is why I am giving this location a 2 star."}
{"text":"Awesome food & beautiful dancing. Always a good time here. Cathy took great care of us!! Thanks all!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here 3 times. The drivers and staff I've talked to have been very friendly, but as others have stated, I found the service to be dreadfully slow on 2/3 of my orders. As for the food, I really enjoyed it when it arrived. The fresh pita was great, and the rest of the food was good enough to order again. However, if I ever wanted Mijana again I would be traveling to the restaurant, rather than ordering delivery."}
{"text":"A little mixed. I have been here twice. First time-great service and I thought the food (beef and chicken shwarmas) were excellent. Second time there was during the friday night belly dancing. Service was slow. Restaurant wasn't that busy, but everyone looked in the weeds. Got the chicken kabobs and first thought was that there wasn't a lot of chicken. It was very good tasting, just seemed like a small portion in comparison to the shwarma. I'll give the place another try and see how it goes...."}
