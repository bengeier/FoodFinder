{"text":"Good food, albeit slightly overpriced. I recommend trying the LA wrap. I've had their salads and I think the chicken they use is gross. But most everything else they have is worth a try. 

Don't bother coming if you don't work nearby. Its good for the office folk but not worth the hassle and drive if it is not by your place of business."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome food , great service, Nick is so accommodating and he is always so gracious. thank you for great food and service!"}
{"text":"I work in the CenturyLink building in Phoenix where CMD is located.  For one, the food is mediocre at best.  The prices are outrageous and the staff is rude.  When I say rude it is an understatement.  Not a single person that works there has ever been friendly.  If I didn't work in the building and have to show any type of professionalism I would have told the hag behind the counter exactly what I thought of her. I have no idea who they think they are since it's the patrons that ultimately pay their salary but I will not be going back.  Food is subpar and services SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Bacon on breakfast sandwich tasted weird, how can you mess up bacon? Ordered from an unfriendly person.  Thought I'd try something different, but I won't be going back. There are so many other great restaurants in this area, I was bummed!"}
{"text":"Was there just now.  Service was fantastic.  Purchased two gatorades, two smart waters and a bacon egg and cheese WITH tomato.  Was super stoked to get back the office and whale on it but they forgot the tomato.  Oh well.  I guess there's greater tragedies in life.  Place should totally do a Groupon.  Was slow on a Friday."}
{"text":"Just had their Brie and Mushroom soup. AMAZING! It was exactly what I wanted!! Once again, great food, great service! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Great place with a personal touch! The owners always remember my name- and the food is very good as well. I've only had their breakfast, and need to try lunch here.  It is a very clean and well-maintained place to go, and the prices are reasonable. The Esplanade needed other alternatives to Starbucks and this restaurant really fits the bill. Recommended!"}
{"text":"This place wouldn't be so bad if everything wasn't so overpriced. The sandwiches and salads are decent quality, nothing spectacular. However, I don't mind eating here because its so conveniently located next to my office. That being said, it's hard to justify it when I'm not getting what I'm pay for. Furthermore, what's even more upsetting than the mediocre quality and sky-high prices is the service. 

The women that answer the phones and work the front desk are atrocious. Incredibly rude, impatient and unhelpful. I came in with a big group and kindly asked if she could split up the checks in two. She reluctantly obliged, after huffing and puffing and rolling her eyes at me, TWICE. I get it, it's probably annoying to have to go the extra mile. But isn't that your job? We all have things we dislike about our jobs, be it in service, sales, retail - whatever. That doesn't justify her nasty behavior. 

The management team here needs to seriously assess the faces of their business. Even though it's the closest eatery to my office, I'll avoid it strictly to avoid having to interact with these women again."}
{"text":"Quick, fast and delish.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"First let me start by saying that I went there on the second day they were open.  Perhaps with time some of the kinks will be worked out, but there are alot of kinks.

I went with 2 friends, and the first thing we noticed is the horrible layout of the place.  1st of all there are 2 registers each with their own line but the registers aren't close enough to each other that its apparent that each are available to take orders.  Second the registers are both very close to the entry doors so if there are more then about 5 people in line the line is out the door, making it difficult for people already inside to leave with out disrupting the line.

Aside from the layout problems with the lines, the line did move fairly quickly and we were able to place our orders in a fair amount of time.  After we placed our orders we sat down at one of the tables and waited.  While waiting we noticed more layout issues.  The spot where the orders come up is on the opposite side of the store from the tables, so if you are sitting down its difficult to hear if they are calling your number (someone calls it out with their voice, there is no loud speaker or microphone).  Plus to make matters worse the lines from the registers are between the tables and the order up counter making it even more difficult to get to your order once it is called.  A third aspect that complicates the issue is that many people are waiting for their order to go, but there is no real place for them to wait  except right in front of the pick up counter (which is about 3 feet from one of the registers).  On this day there were about 15 people waiting in an area that was probably about 10 by 5 feet.  It felt like a crowded elevator - uncomfortable.  Oh and not to mention the soda machine is in this area also, so people are coming and going to get to that as well.

So anyway after about 10 mins or so of waiting for our orders one person in our group went to the pick up window to check on things and was informed that the printer in the cooking area malfunctioned and that all the orders taken in the last 15 mins had not printed out.  So we had to tell the cook directly what we had ordered.  I understand mistakes can happen but it would have been nice if they announced something instead of us having to go and ask.  After about another 10 mins 2 of our 3 orders came up (again it was very difficult to hear if it was indeed your order, and if it was to navigate your way through the crowded area to the pick up window).  Another 5 mins or so went by and our 3rd person still didn't have his order so he went up and asked and it turns out they never put it in with the cook even after we re-ordered due to the broken printer.  So they rushed that order in but when he finally did receive it, it was not prepared the way he had ordered.  Frustrated that he had waited a good 20+ mins and still hadn't gotten what he wanted he asked for a refund which was given to him.

Of the food that we actually did get it was decent, nothing that great but it wasn't bad either.  However it wasn't good enough to over come the short comings in the service.

Overall, I probably won't visit again.  Too bad because the offices in the area have been waiting for a good option that was within walking distance.  Many people were hoping this could be it, but it appears that it will be marginal at best."}
{"text":"This place is on the first floor of the building I work in and is very convenient to go here since all I need to do is go down stairs. It is a little on the pricier side of comparable places but that is what you get for convenience. 
The smoothies are pretty good. Most lunch items are decent. I generally go here in the mornings to get a breakfast burro. I get the sausage burro with a spinach tortilla. Pretty good. Overall, if you don't mind the price I say give it a try."}
{"text":"This is for the location at 2201 E Camelback Rd #130B

My office orders from here a couple of times a month. They have FREE delivery with an order of $20 or more (most of the time, sometimes the driver is out). My 2 favorite things are the Anthens Wrap & the Santa Fe Club sandwich. Always tastes fresh. We've never been there, so I can't speak on the deli itself. We always have the same delivery person & he is nice as pie. The price is right on the mark considering the part of town we are in."}
{"text":"I've stopped in the Esplanade shop a number of times.  These guys do a great job - excellent sandwiches served quickly and reasonably priced.  If you go in there more than once they'll probably know your name by the second visit."}
{"text":"After a second visit and again waiting over 15 minutes to get food (a burger) and when I finally asked it turns out sandwich was one of two I had watched be placed on back counter 10 minutes prior and ignored while taking additional orders. Place was busy at 1pm on a Friday and seemed understaffed. Food is excellent, prices fair and staff polite but unless you have lots if time to wait you might be disappointed. I will probably not be back unless coming with another group."}
{"text":"It is lunchtime. I want it to taste good, be served quick, and priced so I can come here everyday. Look no further than City Market Deli. Randy Kasab is the man and the selection is so large you'll never have the same thing twice. No other place to lunch like this in Biltmore."}
{"text":"This is your classic expensive office quick deli sandwich place. Nothing fancy at all but just good solid sandwiches. I've been here twice now and gotten the pastrami and corn beef sandwiches on rye. Definitely enough to fill you up, just nothing to get too excited about. The prices are a bit steep too, expected for this type of office space"}
{"text":"Moth in my salad and the girls have long hair and no hair nets. Put your hair up and stop touching your face!!!"}
{"text":"I've tired CMD for breakfast times and have had several different sandwhichs for lunch. I call ahead and have never been told more than 5 minutes. The orders are always ready for pick-up. I think they've done a good job of engaging thier patrons on a personal level. Its a definite plus to the complex. I also think they have a nice variety of sandwichs as well. Great inputs: Boar's Head."}
{"text":"Pretty much the smallest, skimpiest sandwich you can spend $9 on. Menu and service is fine, but you do NOT get what you paid for. My sandwich literally has 1 piece of ham on it. 1 piece, folded over to look like more than what it is. The red onion on it was cut at like a 1/2 inch thickness, again probably to make it look bigger than it really is. So $9 for 1 slice of ham and giant onion, with lettuce and tomato. Also - never order the hamburgers... the menu makes them sound delicious... but turns out they just nuke frozen patties and put them on buns. Don't do it! Being inside a corporate center, I get it that they can prey on workers who don't have time to leave the property to eat. I didn't have a choice today and opted to waste $9 instead of not eating at all. This is a terrible lunch option, if you have other options. The store itself is fine, and the staff is really nice. But the value for what you get is awful. Great snack for a rich CEO, disappointing and costly lunch for a working schmoe."}
{"text":"God this place sucks now.... IDk what went wrong since l was here last but the wheels really fell off... Crap service, cashier had an attitude, and the food was just so-so. It's like they stopped trying... l wont be back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm fairly regular here since this place opened.  Prior to the remodel (which I was hoping would result in a change-up of their menu as well), I was happy with their sandwiches but not happy with the processed meat in their salads.  Since they reopened, not only have they not changed up their menu but they have changed their deli meat provider and the meat is now HORRIBLE.  I cannot even eat it.  I'm told that they stopped using Deitz (which to me isn't even comparable to high quality of Primo Taglio or Boars Head anyway) and are now using Hormel meats.  At nearly $8 a sandwich (and over $10 after tax for a combo), I would expect better quality meat than Hormel.  My opinion matches the general consensus of the people in my office.  The owner needs to re-evaluated if its worth it to downgrade quality on their products, when they are losing a large portion of their base in the process.  

If you're an Esplanade tenant, pay a little bit more and get something from TEN, which is exceptional every time."}
{"text":"Very basic processed lunch meat sandwiches not worth your time when there so many other great options in the area."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch a hand full of times because it is a short walk from work. I like their soups, that's about it. They get my order wrong at least 50% of the time, and on two occasions have completely forgotten about my order. The people working there are nice, but they just can't seem to get it right. If you do go here, make sure to check your food for correctness before leaving!"}
{"text":"Meh...I kinda don't understand how this place got such a high review average. 
The food is mediocre, at best. It's definitely overpriced for what you get. 
The workers there kind of have a \"whatever\" type attitude. 
I know I ordered a sandwich as a combo. I noticed after the fact that with the combo you get your choice of side. She didn't even ask me what I wanted so I walked back up to the counter to tell her which side I wanted. When my food was ready (stupid me) I didn't check it until after I got back to work and saw the side which I was supposed to get wasn't there. So I paid almost $12 for a small drink and a bland sandwich. Awesome. And I wasn't going to go back just for the side. I'll just write if off as a reason to not go back."}
{"text":"The convenience, speed, service, price, selection, and taste that you expect from your favorite lunch spots.  It is your standard sandwich/salad fare but the menu is inclusive enough for most tastes.  A welcome addition to the neighborhood.

If it is any consolation to Kerstin B, their new to go menu has a current phone number."}
{"text":"This place is new in the area, and has a lot of potential.  I unfortunately had to witness business practices of theirs that was not at all professional. They try to compete with the Starbuck's next to them when they should be working together. Sandwiches and coffee are not the same thing, an indirect market to be competing with.  Sorry to tell them, Seattle's Best IS Starbucks! *Shakes Head* One of these days I'll go back and try their food again because it's not bad, it's the service and their business approach."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 3200 E CAMELBACK LOCATION WHICH IS NOT LISTED ON YELP...

I've noticed food quality has gone downhill the past 2 months as have my co-workers.  Save your hard-earned money and walk across the street to the Safeway deli - trust me!!!

I bought a Snickers bar there right before Christmas and the chocolate was all discolored and it was bad.  I looked at the expiration date and it was that same month - no wonder!  Exchanged for another which was also bad.  Threw it and my money away...

Ordered a taco salad last week and here's the skinny...  Was on the menu as being served in a edible taco shell - let me tell you, the taco shell was far from edible.  The taco shell was burnt tasting.  Now, how do you burn a pre-made taco shell that is sold in the masses?  Take it out of the package, put it in the microwave and warm it up.  As everyone who has ever eaten here knows, everything is purchased as a pre-packaged item.  Nothing is \"FRESH\" by fresh standards.  It's all bought like Costco products, in bulk and all pre-packaged and I mean everything!

The menu reads it includes a 5ounce portion of chicken.  Not only was there not 5 ounces, it tasted like frozen, rubber chicken.  No flavor, no seasoning, bland and yuck!!!  There was barely any shredded cheese on top and the salsa was the worst tasting jarred salsa I've ever had - ever!!!  I have eaten and liked jarred salsa but this was truly awful.  There was also supposed to be red onions.  I found 1 tiny sliver of one piece of red onion in the whole thing.  

The sour cream was provided in a squeeze on packet just like they serve their packaged cream cheese in the morning with bagels.  

Overall for $9.00, I was ripped off.   If you go to a restaurant at lunch and spend $9.00 on a taco salad, not only is it fresh, it actually tastes good.

Myself and my co-workers are pretty much done with this place.  The prices are too high, the food is not fresh and for the prices charged and the quality of pre-packaged food they are getting is grade school quality.  I would never recommend anyone to come into this building to buy lunch there, go to Safeway, more bang for your buck and the food quality is far superior!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, though it's hit or miss. I've had food that's awesome, and I've had food that's meh. A little pricey for what you actually get as well. Great service though and the manager is awesome."}
{"text":"I love to hate this place. the food is always great! Seriously that is the reason why I keep coming back. The customer service is horrible! I've worked in restaurants and in customer service and this place has horrible customer service.  It's not that they are rude, here are some of the things that have made me love to hate this place.
 I just sat on hold for 15 minutes only to be disconnected. When I called back I told the lady and she seemed apologetic about it. Also while I was on hold I tried calling from my work number to see if they would take my order (without loosing my place on hikd lol) but the line was busy, so that means no one else was able to do a phone order for 15 mins as well.
In the past I have been told they can't deliver because they are short handed or they are training and can't leave the new kid. 
There have been times where they didn't call to let me know they were on their way and my food has gotten cold while I waited for a call.
There have been times where they forgot to bring my order when they did a big building order all at once.
I've been told they would do a group delivery at 1130am and nothing for me came till 1pm (it's ordered at 11 so that was a 2 hr wait.)
So just a heads up, it takes forever to order or get your food but it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I carpool into work with my partner so a lot of days, I do not have the car on me. This place delivers all the time to the building I work in. I work in a building with a lot of employees so they do come here a lot. They are ALWAYS SO friendly and so quick. The food is always delicious and I think their prices are VERY fair and you get an excellent serving size. Delivery is always quick and SUPER friendly. I always meet Maria the Manager and she is SO KIND hearted and ALWAYS has a smile on her face. Me and my colleagues love to order here and they are a life saver in my situation. Lots of different choices to suit different tastes and moods. HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Once again I receive nothing but the best. Jamie is as, always a daily pick-me-up with her smile and how she greats people by their 1st names. Rob is a master chef. The bbq burger I got today was truly a piece of art and every bite had flavors of bacon, beef, lettuce and the special BBQ. Yesterday, Erica helped me order the Chicken ranch sandwich on a crossiant and it was simply mouthwatering. Give them a shot, worth the stop. Even my elderly parents stopped by to get some coffee and cookies and they are greated with kindness and great service. Keep it up City Market."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down over the past year or so. The management is non existent, and for the most part the staff has no idea of what customer service is. Simple things like \"Good Morning\" or \"Thank you\" or \"I'm sorry we screwed up your order again\" don't happen here. I work in the building this \"Deli\" is in, and most people in our office avoid this place. 
Considering what they charge versus what you get, you're much better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"The service at this place is horrible. I work in the office building and I often stop to pick up a quick cup of soup to bring back to my desk. It takes forever. I've often waited for 15 minutes while I can SEE my soup just sitting there! The food is not bad but the only reason I still occasionally come here is because it's in the building."}
{"text":"Convenient and quick. The food is usually great quality. It is a bit on the expensive side. I guess that's what you pay for convenience."}
{"text":"I ordered a bagel and ask for it to be well toasted and it was barely warm. The sandwiches are also not very good. It was early morning and they had already run out of coffee which makes me believe that it wasn't fresh or they don't refill it often or something is wrong there. It is never very busy and now I see why."}
{"text":"This establishment is great for a quick lunch. Almost everything is priced at $9.99 for a sandwich, chips and a water. I had a very good chicken, avacado, bacon, lettuce and mayo. I was in a hurry and I was in and out in twenty minute. (Ordered an ate)"}
{"text":"OK so today someone in my office brought me a sandwich from City Market Deli. It was the Santa Fe Club. Oven Gold Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato, Alfalfa Sprouts, Chipotle Mayo served on Our Toasted Multi-Grain Bread.

The bread is very good and the sandwich has a good amount of flavorful turkey. The chipotle mayo has just the right amount of heat. Overall a very tasty sandwich!"}
{"text":"The Good: sandwiches are mostly very quality and are made quickly. Not crazy about the Tuna salad - too rich. Same goes for the Chicken salad sandwich. The beef sandwiches are really good. 

Not so good: they seem to have a high turnover rate for employees. The man who seems to be managing is more often than not engaged in loud conversations with vendors and other people. He is often arguing with people related to the Esplanade management. It does not create a pleasant ambience. I am fed up with this guy and will not be back."}
{"text":"Great prices and selection. I wish I would have found this yesterday when I got there. Concierge from Canby told me about it though! I was looking for a wheat or multi grain bagel and they had them. Also had salads, snacks and lots of great sounding sandwiches. Check this place out. Next time I come to this area I will stop for lunch."}
{"text":"LOVE their Chicago Dog!  The food is well priced and made well, the breads, meats and veggies are wonderful.  The service has never been bad, and always friendly.   If you like meat and even not, there are salads, skip Paradise across the street and try this instead!"}
{"text":"The nicest young woman works there and she is a delight to see. Plus, their food is high quality."}
{"text":"Not very friendly service. No hello when we walked in, nothing said to me except, \"is this all you will need?\" And gave me my total. There was no one in the place, so they were not busy with other customers. I hope the food is good here, because the personalities are at level 0. We just grabbed a few snacks for my kiddos, so I cannot give a review on the food. We will not go back to try."}
{"text":"Highly convenient if you are in the Portales Business Center in Scottsdale. FREE delivery to any office for any amount of food in the 2 building complex rain or shine, early or late. I ordered a cheese danish for $1.50 and got it delivered. That kind of service is rare and worth this review.

The food menu is very reasonable. My lunch with combo is never over $10/day. I cannot speak for the coffee side since I dont drink coffee. But the overall atmosphere, the quickness of the ordering and giving and the general inexpensive without eating crap is really great. 

If you are coming through Scottsdale during the day and looking for a gem with good food and solid prices this is a nice change."}
{"text":"The Andrew person below is insanely out of his mind, Jamie is the worse and extremely rude. Maybe it helps if you're a dude and she can send you a Facebook friend request and try to holla. This place recently switched ownership to 'One Coffee Co' a do am hoping for significant changes, or I still won't be returning, and I know this holds the same for the majority of the people in my office that are also done with 'the deli'"}
{"text":"Nice friendly place fast service, I come here for my lunch break sometimes, city market burger is my thing but the Chicago dog is hard to resist. Covered Seating outside if you wanna enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"The Owner and Employees are nice people, but there is definitely an advantage for City Market 2 being located in a corporate building because they can charge ridiculous prices for the convenience. I try to avoid ordering from them as much as possible. This morning I ordered an Americano (1 shot espresso and water) and a cheese Danish and it was 5.50. The Danish was a few days old because it was hard as a brick and was uneatable. I will seriously never, ever order for them again."}
{"text":"I love going down to the deli! Great food even friendlier staff! Bonnie and Jamie seem to know everyone by name and always have a smile on their face, even when the place is jam packed! The cook, Jacob, is awesome and never fails to throw a quick wave. They have had to overcome some hurdles this past year with a little bit of staff turnover, but always seem upbeat and positive with the changes. Thank you for providing great customer service, you guys rock!"}
