{"text":"What a great find for a quick lunch. The place was packed on a Monday afternoon,  but barely any wait even though there was a line. The roti chicken was delicious, along with the crispy yucca fries and a side of sweet plantains. Be sure to try all the pepper sauces the are all very flavorful and really complement the dishes nicely!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today, and loved it! Chicken flavor and texture is very good, cooked just right. Sweet potato fries, good amount and very crispy. The corn salad, with edamame, cilantro, tomato, cucumber and feta was awesome. The dressing was soo good. Clean, bathroom clean. Just great experience for \"fast\" food. Only drawback is music is too loud!!!!"}
{"text":"Got to go of Arroz Chaufa (Peruvian fried rice) for dinner. It is too much salty like they put some kind of lot of soy sauce in it. Despite of being very hungry i couldnt eat much of it becuase of its very salty taste."}
{"text":"Peruvian food is finally getting some recognition in Charlotte!  Viva Chicken has really good roasted chicken, with two amazing sauces to dip it in, and some delicious side options.  The plantains are always a good choice, but I haven't had anything that I didn't like.  The quinoa stuffed avocado is also amazing!"}
{"text":"Maybe one of my fave Peruvian restaurants that I have been to in the states. The chicken = perfect. Yucca, plantains and alforajes, all were amazing. The staff was friendly and the food came out fast. I was there at lunch. We were in and out in 50 minutes. Also, the prices were consistent with lunch prices in this area."}
{"text":"Amazing little place! We were looking for a place to eat on Sunday and it was one of the few top rated listed when we searched and it has definitely lived up to its rating. The food is delicious. We had the 1/4 chicken with infused rice and plantains and the classic saltado. Everything was cooked wonderfully, and absolutely delicious. There was also two types of sauces served with the food that were really different and insanely flavorful. We also had the maracuya juice- highly recommend it, as an islander. I also really liked that they served everything on biodegradable dishes. And to put that fifth star on there- the service was very gracious and attentive."}
{"text":"I didn't know what Peruvian food would be like, but it's amazing. The food is just plain flavorful, and an incredible value to boot! Chicken is outstandingly moist, and the accompanying sauces pack a major taste punch. Sides are consistently good, too, and the tres leches cake is a sugar bomb in the best way. A wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! The chicken is fantastic, you can make it as spicy as you want with their sauces (which is good for those of us who love it burning). The rice is awesome. Overall a great experience, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Incredible chicken and sauces, plantains were flavorful and the passion fruit mousse is heaven!"}
{"text":"Yelp brought me and my vegan friend to this Peruvian place. Employees were so nice they answered almost every questioned we had and helped us to find the right dish. Then we sampled all three house special drinks and decided to go with the maracuya and chicha morada. Don't ever miss their special drinks. Here comes the food, herb grilled rotisserie chicken with plantains and cilantro rice. I loved it and my friend choose to go with naked peruvian wrap with sweet potato fries and we decide to end our feast with tres leches. Food was very good and served with great hospitality. Small place, big taste. Give a try when you get a chance."}
{"text":"Second trip. Oh my god. This Saltado is so good I want to eat my mouth."}
{"text":"Quinoa stuffed avocado with the pulled chicken has never let me down. I highly recommend this uptown spot!"}
{"text":"This is always my first and last stop when I'm in Charlotte. Phenomenal service, sauces, sandwiches, sides - everything about this place makes my heart happy.

The quinoa stuffed avocados are a favorite, and definitely try the chica Moraga and herbal lemonade. Flavors you will not find anywhere else."}
{"text":"I had the quarter chicken.   All white meat with a side salad and sweet potato fries.  Great salad mix, skip the dressing and use the roasted pepper sauce, nice and spicey.  Fries were fresh,  hot and awesome.  Chicken was good, rotisserie style.  Seemed small but I was full in the end and I think this is a good place."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is awesome!  I went here on the recommendation from a friend and was not disappointed. I tried the classic saltado which was amazing. Fresh ingredients with so much flavor.  The staff are so helpful and friendly. They walked me through the menu.  This is a great choice for a casual sit down meal or take-out for your family!  They also have some great beer to pick from!"}
{"text":"We were looking for authentic Mexican food and it was like a regular food chain . The rice was dry  but the drinks were amazing !"}
{"text":"Ballantyne location:


Oh, woe is me.

What have they done ?  Why?

This place was a solid 5 stars, but now I have to lower it to 3 stars due to management stupidity.

In a serious lack of judgement, Viva Chicken has eliminated some of its most interesting and delicious menu items.

Gone is the spectacular Maracuya Mousse, the amazing flavor depth and complexity of the Tallarin Saltado, the surprising Chocotejas with their mixture of chocolate, caramel and pecans are soon to disappear.

And the Huancaina!  A Peruvian Specialty.  How and why would you eliminate this classic dish?

It seems like Viva Chicken has opted to go the way of mediocrity and removed many of the dishes which those of us seeking a true ethnic experience have been enjoying.

We were visiting this restaurant from SW Charlotte at least twice a week and spending a substantial amount of money each visit. I can assure you we won't be visiting often unless these amazing items return.

Very sad turn of events, indeed.

Guess I'm going back to Genaro's ...sigh."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken lives up to the hype! Can't believe it took me this long to have lunch there, had to get the quinoa stuffed avocados since I have seen them instagrammed multiple times, they were awesome, don't miss out on the yuca fries! This location was packed at lunch time, but service and food was super quick and friendly"}
{"text":"This was a chill spot for some Peruvian food.  Had the Limena Chopped Salad with pulled Rotisserie chicken - Kale & Romaine lettuce , peruvian Corn, Edamame, Queso Fresco, Bacon, Chickpeas, Aji Amarillo Ranch Dressing. Pretty good salad. My freind had the The Great Sandwich-Pulled Rotisserie Chicken, Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion, Rocoto Mayo and a side of sweet potato fries. We got a side of plantains and yuca which came with a creamy queso fresco sauce. Everything was good but the only complaints we have are that the fries were cold. For me, the Yuca tasted weird. It was crispy on the outside but creamy on the inside, which ive never experience with fried yuca. Other than that, the food was great."}
{"text":"We love this place!  The food is delicious and many healthy items are available.  Perhaps best of all, the staff is always extremely friendly without being intrusive.  This will remain a go-to for us for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"Order the Inca Wrap and thank me later. The Inca wrap is crammed full of rice, delicious chicken and zesty salsa (my favorite). I order mine with a side of plantains. I highly recommend the yellow sauce. It's not really spicy but add enough zing to your meal without burning your taste buds. 

Please try their drinks. I've been there on several occasions and the drinks have been different but I've enjoyed all of them. They included interesting ingredients like purple corn and lavender. But If you're an adventurous eater then your taste buds will be happily surprised. 

Overall, Viva Chicken is a go-to eating spot. I am never displeased with my experience."}
{"text":"the place is a get in line to order and bring a number to your table  type of restaurant.  I had the Butieffa or something like that, sweet potato fries, and yuca fries.  My wife had the \"the great\" sandwich with Plantains.  My pork sandwich with onion slaw was good  ..but wasn't something I would get again.  The sweet potato fries were generic.  Now, the Yuca fries were good as long as you don't dip them in the sauce it comes with because it taste like cheap nacho cheese.  Now, there was a secret yellow sauce they served both my wife and me that made everything alot better.  I ended up putting it on everything.  my wife's sandwich had chicken with it that was a little dry and very bland.  If we go back we will try the chicken alone because it seems like thar was what most people were eating.  All in all, the prices were great and the food was on the healthier side."}
{"text":"Mahvelous!!! Great food prices service volume quality. Sangria is home made daily. Sauces are the best. Stuffed avocado is remarkable. First time already planning our return. The owner came to our table and all the servers are just excellent. can not get over the volume and quality of the food for the money the flavors are undescribable! Wish we could give them 12 stars! Ok"}
{"text":"Our family thought it would be a good place to try after seeing such great reviews. This place was amazing! Five star food, environment and service. We will def be back real soon."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. Haven't had everything on the menu but I can tell you I have never had anything bad. I really enjoy the fried rice with chicken added. The sauces are all great too. Just wish they stayed open longer :/"}
{"text":"Disappointed totally. The presentation of the food was sloppy and un appetizing. Ballantyne location is 100% better and consistent."}
{"text":"I really did not understand how this place kept coming up as a top place to eat in Charlotte...until I tried it. The chicken is so savory and those SAUCES. The mint sauce is my favorite though you can't go wrong with any of them. My go to is the quarter chicken with green beans & plantains."}
{"text":"I want to love Viva Chicken.  I really do.  I LOVE peruvian food and live just two minutes down the road.  I have now been three times, and it has slipped each time.  

Every visit I have shared the chicken and the classic saltados (stir fried beef, tomatoes, onions, and french fries in a vinegary soy sauce.)  My first experience was a solid 4 stars.   The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the saltados were on point.   I should mention that saltados would likely be my desert island food choice.  I love almost every version.  
On visit two, the chicken was ok.  Not as flavorful as I remembered, but still good.  The saltados however were kind of dismal.  Dry, tough beef and completely disintegrated fries.  It was almost like it had been sitting for a while, even thought I know that wasn't the case.   I left just a little unsatisfied.  

Round three was just kind of sad.  I was determined to relive my fist experience, so I returned again.   The chicken skin was cold and flabby.  The saltados had a weird, charred quality to them with no decernable sauce.   Even the dulce de leche cookies for dessert were bad; sandy and stale this time.  

The service however is impeccable.  They really try to provide a great experience.  If only the kitchen had the same consistency."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The employees are so kind and quickly fix any problems. I am seeing myself here again."}
{"text":"The power salad is a homerun!

The fried rice, usually ordered to go with chicken, get smaller every time I order it. Bought it yesterday and the container was just over half full. Does rice keep going up in price or something?

It's expensive, so how about not being so skimpy with a little rice?"}
{"text":"OMG!!!!  My new favorite restaurant.  The food is so good.  The chicken is wonderful.  Everything is so fresh and healthy, I love it.  The huacatay sauce is insane good!  I put that on the salad instead of the dressing.  Has a nice kick to it.  The Great sandwich on ciabatta bread is also amazing.  My boyfriend gets the chicken and rice and he's very picky.......he LOVES this place.  Seriously you have to try it.  Its not too expensive and they have a rewards program too.  

Food is fresh, delicious, well priced, order is always correct, people are friendly....."}
{"text":"I'm loathe to rave about this place for fear of making the lines even longer, but this is the best rotisserie chicken in the city. Husband loves the various sauces like mad, and I think their quinoa-stuffed avocados are the best thing on the menu. Neither of us has tried something we didn't truly enjoy. It's our go-to takeout place for supper."}
{"text":"I've been to Viva Chicken several times now and love the food each time I go. I have tried several different sandwiches and each one thus far has been delicious. I also love the sauces that come with the sandwiches and sides. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very healthy food and good for money and fresh food I will go back again and refer to my friend and family"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Quick and tasty! Yummy sauces!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  The avocado with quinoa?!?!  Yes. The wait at lunch is forever long but waaaaay worth it. I recommend both the green and yellow sauce and definitely the pulled chicken. 

Th patio is really lovely in the summer - all around lovely :)"}
{"text":"Best chicken in town. Eat healthy and quick, with a great upbeat vibe. Love this place."}
{"text":"First tried Viva Chicken as takeout at my job - we had it several times over the course of two months and let me tell you, everyone I work with adores Viva Chicken.  I went to the actual restaurant location last Saturday (wanted my mom to try it) and was even more pleased.  It is a little bit of a hike for me since I live in the Ballantyne area, but it was worth it!  I haven't branched out to multiple menu items (not yet!) because I typically stick to the rotisserie chicken and two sides whenever I order.  Viva Chicken is so delicious though and knowing that I'm going to partake in their tastiness usually improves my day drastically :)  I order the chicken with fruit (trying to be somewhat healthy) and fried yucca (yeah, there goes the healthy).  I haven't had good fried yucca since I ate Cuban food in Key West, but Viva nailed it - delicous and creamy with lightly salted and crispy exterior.  The chicken was cooked perfectly, with signature moisture.  My mom had the cilantro rice and of course we poured their signature sauces (green and yellow) over everything.  I enjoy it so much, I think I even dipped the fruit in it.  We finished the meal off with some cookies that I cannot remember the name of - sort of like really soft shortbread with powdered sugar on it and sandwiching some nutella like sauce - also amazing.  Service was prompt and polite and several times, people came over to ask if the food was good and to refill water/take plates away, etc.  Everyone there seemed happy to be there, which made for a welcoming and pleasant atmosphere.  In my opinion, this place is a gem!  Some people might think it is a little pricey, but we paid around twenty bucks for our meals - keep in mind this is a hefty portion of chicken, breast and leg meat with a hearty helping of sides as well - so I thought the price was fair.  I feel like I can't go out to eat for 2 people without spending close to twenty bucks these days anyway and with far less satisfaction than I had at Viva Chicken.  And I am very excited to report that I was told they are potentially opening a location in Ballantyne!  Woo hoo!  I might never cook again!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. It is healthy yet not boring. Unique flavors are blended to make delicious food! It is different... But different is good! It is a really good place to eat! You can't really go wrong with any of the food! Even the drinks include a green lemonade and a berry juice. It is a great lunch stop! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food tastes great while I was scarfing it down. However, it wasn't as good coming back up.

Pretty sure I got food poisoning from eating here, as I got sick about 4 hours after finishing my meal.

Maybe I'll try it again in the future, but certainly no time soon."}
{"text":"Fast Food Peruvian! Who knew that was even a thing? If you haven't found this or should I now say these little treasures as they are expanding all over town, then your missing out! Hands down the best new concept to hit this market in a long time. The food and service are spot on. The prices are decent, however the portion sizes and friendly staff make you quickly forget about that. I hope to see more locations popping up soon. Hopefully around Concord, Southpark and Northlake? A boy can dream..."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  Was to be a Sat lunch exploration.  Loud.  Confusion.  And that was before the order place.  Order taken but told it would be a 10 min wait to get seated.  Really?  Not worth the time."}
{"text":"I knew I was in for a treat when I walked through the door.  It smells delicious in here!

 Everything on the menu sounds amazing so it was hard to make a choice. I decided to go with their specialty: the Peruvian rotisserie chicken. I got the 1/4 chicken (white meat) with plantains and fresh fruit. For my drink, the choice was a little easier because they let me sample the specialty beverages. The Peruvian passion fruit was quite tasty. The food was delicious. The chicken is seasoned well and I love the dipping sauces. The green one is my favorite. 

I also got the tres leches cake for dessert. OMG. It was excellent. It was so moist and sweet. They give you a pretty big piece, so I recommend sharing it. 

This place has a really cute atmosphere. I love all of the plants surrounding the outdoor patio. The service was fast and friendly. What a great spot!!"}
{"text":"YUM!  Everything I've had here is fantastic ~    The salads are huge and so fresh and good.   Every time I am in that area (one in Huntersville too) I stop in."}
{"text":"This is such a GREAT addition to this area. I have ordered at the Johnson Rd location many times and been very happy with the food. Tonight was my first experience with the Waverley location and I have to say that I was blown away with how friendly and professional the young staff were. You've done a great job training this crew. Congratulations. If you haven't been there yet get there! All of the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Had the half chicken, rice and green beans which were delicious. It only took a couple minutes to get my food. The staff was really polite. Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely be back.

Get dark meat only. The white meat was very good, but the dark meat is on another level!"}
{"text":"Viva Pollo! This place rocks. The chicken soup they serve would piss off Jewish mothers everywhere because it's better than what they make. Large portions and reasonable priced. If you go there hungry you won't leave that way. Excellent value."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Viva Chicken on Sunday as it was the only eatery open on Elizabeth Ave. for an early dinner. What an amazing surprise! Judging from the menu, we knew this was our type of food and when they brought it to our table, WHOA! Our order: Chicken Caesar Salad, Stuffed Avocado with added chicken and Sopa de Pollo... Everything tasted fresh, lightly dressed and delicious! It's an order, get a number and seat yourself type of place... with EXCEPTIONAL service! The servers that deliver the food to your table politely smiling and in a non-rushed manner ask if there's anything you need. There were also 2 other employees (one may have been a manager) that asked if we needed anything. I don't get that kind of service at a formal dining experience. We were so happy and will be headed back every weekend!"}
{"text":"I go to Viva chicken easily 2+ time per week. The food quality and taste is amazing. The only reason I am not giving it 5 starts is a technicality I hope they fix with my suggestion. I find it hard to understand why when you order 1/2 chicken and 1/4 chicken the sides are exactly the same size, specially the plantains. The sides should be proportioned to size of the order. Other than that don't miss out on this place because it's probably the best rotisserie chicken in town. I'm habitual so I always get 1/2 chicken with 2 sides."}
{"text":"So glad to have an alternative to all of the other typical chain places around Concord Mills. The food is wonderful, and they always do their best to make sure that you are taken care of. Will be back on at least a weekly basis."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything I've tried has been delicious. Great prices, great quality, definitely a great value! I typically eat here if I'm in the mood for a quick, healthy option. But it's great for everyone with their wide array of options on the menu. Everyone raves about the stuffed avocado, and I also love the salads and wraps!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is a great spot when I'm having a craving for something comforting! The chicken-rice dish is amazing (...I don't know what the actual name of the dish is)! I'm just a little disappointed with the service. It always seems like it takes a long time to get food after I order. It's just a little slow for a place that is supposed to be quick."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Especially if you put one of their sauces on whatever you order. And LOVE the fact they're very eco-friendly"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch at the recommendation of a work friend. Outstanding! Had the half chicken platter and ate every bit.  The Peruvian chicken recipe is perfect. They had sauce to dip, which were good in themselves, but I thought it took away from the chicken itself so I didn't use them. 
I will be back."}
{"text":"Their food was OK, but I was thrown off by the \"one $,\" as this place was not cheap in my opinion! I have been to better Peruvian restaurants that were a lot cheaper! I got the Viva Chicken Salad and expected the chicken on the salad to be seasoned, but it was not. Very bland. The Sweet Plantains were the only good thing about this place, but you can get those at any Peruvian joint. Also, we sat out on the patio in the afternoon and they had really annoying club music blasting through the outdoor speakers. When I go out to lunch, I want a relaxing, quiet atmosphere. Maybe that's just me. Overpriced IMHO, and I think what we were paying for was the \"trendy\" atmosphere, NOT good food."}
{"text":"I have no idea how I have lived in Charlotte this long and have not been to Viva Chicken until the other night.

Since it is Elizabeth, parking is never good. However, we were able to get a street spot down from the restaurant. (not a bad walk). 

Between my girlfriend and I, we ordered the half chicken and the with green beans and chicken soup and the herbal lemonade. We then went to the sauce area to grab one of each of the sauces.Man, these sauces are A-mazing!! The chicken was cooked to perfection.  The sauces on it were a great combo. Next time, we are getting the full order! The green beans were nicely roasted. However, as crazy as it sounds, the winner of the night was the chicken soup. It was so basic (chicken, broth, veggies, rice) but so incredibly flavorful. Also, so glad I took the recommendation from a fellow Yelper to order the herbal lemonade cause it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's busy all the time which says a bunch. I've had a handful of different things - all really good."}
{"text":"OMG. I would walk to Peru if this place ever closed down. If given the choice between easing into a warm bath or into a vat of their roasted rocotto sauce, I would choose the sauce. Do yourself a favor and grab lunch/dinner here."}
{"text":"My family and I are ADDICTED to this place.  In addition to the outstanding food, the owners are generous to those who are less fortunate.  If you bring someone in who is \"in need\" their meal will be comped.  They also offer a 10 percent discount to Presbyterian Hospital employees and CPCC students.  People \"in need\" are also fed for free Monday afternoons.  This is a local restaurant that has heart."}
{"text":"Place was super busy maybe because it is close to two schools and the hospital but employees took it in stride!! They were helpful and quick. Friendly and fun service! Had the chicken sandwich, with fries. Yummy! Tender chicken, just the right amount of crisp on the fries. Everything was seriously good. Also, try their drinks! The juices are amazinnnng. Their special sauces are so good too,  particularly the orangeish colored one, forgot what it was called..but it had just enough spice!  The others were good too. I love this place. And will most definitely be here again - soon!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place about once a month or so. You can't go wrong with the quarter or half chicken combo. I usually get the cilantro rice and either yucca or fried plantains. My favorite is the yellow sauce....I could put it on everything. I've also been known to get dessert from there when a sugar craving hits. Best tres leches I've had in Charlotte and the alfajores melt in your mouth. Go now!"}
{"text":"Amazing food from beginning to end. Don't miss the quinoa stuffed avocado. The Classic Saltado is scrumptious! Great kids menu too :)"}
{"text":"I am so glad I decided to give Viva Chicken a try. The first time I dined there, I ordered the Classic saltado. OMG. Basmati rice, sirloin served on a bed of fries, yummy deliciousness!!!!! I ordered a side of plantains to accompany the whole dish. Seriously. I can't get over how good this dish is!!!! My friends had the rotisserie chicken, which they have become addicted to as well! I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Try the Naked Peruvian as a wrap. It is less messy and still delicious."}
{"text":"Our first time eating here and enjoyed the meals. The mint flavor drink is refreshing and delicious."}
{"text":"Really good! Unfortunately the patio was closed for a private party and the ac was on a bit too strong, otherwise it would have been a near perfect dining experience. It was unexepectedly casual, order at the counter, serve your own drink, paper plates and plastic cutlery, but that was ok. The food was quite good. My wife and i shared avocado with quinoa which she loved more than i. However i had the fried rice with chicken. Big portions and a nice flavor that was even better when i mixed in the spicy green sauce that came with it. My wife got a quarter of roasted chicken with beans and great sweet plantains. We both got passion fruit, maracuya, juice which was delightful. All this  for 30 bucks. I thought it was a great deal for some tasty food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat whenever I visit Charlotte. Love their salads with rotisserie chickens."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh. Staff is always friendly and fast! Favorite place to eat in Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"Clean, fresh, delicious, fast, affordable , accessible and flavorful ... Also! Green conscientious !"}
{"text":"Came here for an early birthday lunch with my husband. The food is great. Everything was fresh. Herbal Lemonade is on point."}
{"text":"Went on a friday night and it was almost empty. However the food was very good. I had the great sandwich gf had the inca wrap. Mine was a little on the small side but still good. My gf could not finish her wrap it was quite large. The fries were excellent and crispy style. The sweet potato fries were great as well. I highly advise going here."}
{"text":"Great food in a casual atmosphere.  I am a big fan of the yucca and plaintains.  Great stuffed avacado."}
{"text":"My husband and I are obsess with this place! We can never again eat rotisserie chicken from a grocery store ever again! I was iffy about this place at first, but everyone I know that have ate here has loved it so I had to give it a try. The chicken is super delicious and tender and the dipping sauce just add a bonus to it! We also love their fries. My husband works at the hospital so we also get an extra 10% discount  on our meal. We have started making this a dinner meal every other week or so. Definitely worth a try! :)"}
{"text":"Great food best in town. Wow. Charlotte needed this. The great sandwich is awesome.great deals after 230"}
{"text":"What can I say about Viva Chicken? Total yummers! Every time someone in my office walks in with this for lunch, I know where they went and start craving it as well. My coworker introduced me to this restaurant and I'm hooked! 

Before visiting here, I had never had Peruvian food. I have to say, it's a new favorite of mine now. Their chicken is so good, but I usually don't order the 1/4 chicken and 2 sides, unlike my friends. I'm a little bit more adventurous and it has worked out in my favor here, with the exception of the herbal lemonade (VERY herbal, just not my style and not for the light of heart). The quinoa stuffed avocados are SO yummy. I could make an entire meal off of two of these, but I never do because I can't resist the cilantro infused rice every time I go there. It's some of the best rice I've ever had. \"The Great\" is also a winner in my book! Hold the onions, please. Choose ciabatta bread or a wrap -- whatever floats your boat.  

The chicken is an honorable mention, but the true star of the show at Viva is the Aji Amarillo Sauce...soooooo good, I can't even describe the flavor goodness, but I've ever had anything like it. This sauce is truly addicting! 

The parking across the street is a bummer, as the lot is usually full at lunchtime. Come early -- it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat at!! always busy for a reason, the juices are healthy substitutes for Soda."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Love how great the chicken is! The place is very clean and the staff is helpful. I'm not Peruvian but my sister in law is and she loves it too. Makes her feel like she is at home."}
{"text":"Oh Viva, I love you! Ever since the first time I've gone to get their chicken, I've been hooked. The sauces compliment the chicken perfectly. The plantains are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Tender, tasty chicken and herbal limeade have my praise. The side options, while plentiful, are a little disappointing for someone looking for gluten free items--not because Viva Chicken has to cater to gf eating--but because what they offer could be made gf but isn't. Cilantro rice and green beans are safe, but many of the other choices are not."}
{"text":"The chicken here is phenomenal. I really love how tender and juicy it is, and it just falls apart in your mouth. The fried yucca is a must try!

The service is as good as the food, if not even better. The waiter even offered to refill my fountain drink for me!

It is a bit pricey, but well worth it! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Hey there! We just tried the new Ballantyne location that recently opened for the first time. Staff was very helpful and courteous and the food was just as yummy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Get the fries! Crispy outside and great way to sample all of the dipping sauces. 

Viva Chicken has a fun lunch atmosphere with very generous servings. There are options for the \"I just want meat\" people and any Trader Joe's clientele."}
{"text":"Great Service!  The Herbal lemonade is amazing.  The food is great and perfect for lunch.  It's not too expensive and you get more than what you pay for!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"My favorite new place! I've tried a lot of things on the menu, and never been disappointed: tacu bowl, classic saltado, inca wrap, wow lomito an the great. The hardest part is deciding. 

Great food, great prices and the sauces really seal the deal"}
{"text":"Just so you know I did not want to make this comparison, but they made me do it!  

The wife and I went yesterday to check it out and we both got the quarter chicken with two sides.  Her sides were salad and fried yuca and my sides were salad and plantains.  The yuca was fried crispy and dry and not oily at all.  The plantains were delicious and sweet.  Now for the chicken.  For the most part is was good, but I have had better at Boston Market.  My main issue was the fact that there was a portion of the chicken that was still pink and undercooked.  Some of the meat \"refused\" to be pulled from the bone.  The best way to tell if a chicken is well done is when the wing pulls easily from the breast meat.  The wing on my piece and her piece did not want to  pull easily from the breast meat.  In fact it did not release at all.  The part that was done tasted okay, but if I am paying it all better taste good.  You guys try it and tell me if you like it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and seating. Large amount of food for an affordable price. Outdoor seating under heat lamps makes for a nice meal on a sunny, winter day. Coming back here to try something new because everything looks great."}
{"text":"Been here 7 times since they've opened. Love this place. Food is great and service is good too."}
{"text":"A great addition to the Charlotte food scene. The menu is original and the authentic Peruvian style cuisine is unlike anything you can try at most places, and at a good price ($10-12 per person). This place has great food, and big portions, but don't got there expecting much besides their specialties: rotisserie chicken, rice, sandwiches, and great ,great sauces. The place is well decorated and has a nice outdoor patio, and the service is polite and friendly."}
{"text":"The quinoa-stuffed avocado with chicken was so good my husband and I came back 3 days later to try the rotisserie chicken... which was slightly disappointing. They serve it in these cool metal trays, which are great for looking at but not great for cutting into your food (with bendy plastic silverware). My chicken was a tad dry, but I liked the side of beans and the fried plantains (how could you not like fried plantains?) - but my husband liked his chicken and didn't think it was dry. I think I have high standards since I love Pio Pio so much, though.

Service is nice, friendly and helpful and they will come around and re-fill your drink for you, which is nice.

So, I'll definitely think we'll be back, but I'll stick to the quinoa-stuffed avocado. Overall, a great, healthy addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything negative about Viva other than the crowd (because it's so good)! The price is reasonable and I always leave very, very full. 

Options range from rice bowls and salads to quinoa-stuffed avocado with pulled chicken on top. It's all rich in flavor, and the chicken is so moist. There are 3 sauces you can put on your meal: mild, medium, and hot, and they are all delicious depending on your preference. My boyfriend's favorite is the Wow Lomito steak sandwich (though I can't stray from the chicken). My go-to is the Tacu Bowl, which is a rice bowl topped with fresh avocado, veggies, and a heaping pile of Peruvian pulled chicken. 

Viva defines fast casual. The last 3 times that I've been, we order, walk to the drink machines and get our favorite sauces, and by the time we find a table, they are sitting our food down for us as we are sitting down ourselves. The timing has been flawless. 

If you choose to go during lunch hour during the work week, be prepared for crowds and the noise level that comes with having many happy customers."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is a great place to get a quick and casual bite. If you haven't guess by the name, yes it's totally Americanized but they have done it in a clever and totally likable way. The food is flavorful and consistent. Try the Wow Lomito if you aren't gluten-free, counting calories, carbs or any other nonsense. If you want to take it a step further, get some yucca fries and bathe them in one of their signature sauces and then wash it down with some Maracuya (passion fruit) juice. If this doesn't add some passion in your life, you're hopeless."}
{"text":"Really cool concept to make a Peruvian food restaurant modernized. The chicken and sides are really good. For sides I'd recommend Yuka and the rice. My only critique would be that their chicken are kind of small. Everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken never disappoints! My go to is the Tacu bowl and there's plenty of food to get two to three meals out of it. The selection of sauces are perfection! The green is my favorite. And try the herbal lemonade! It's amazing!! Great service and easy for pick ups too!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to Viva Chicken. I had heard great things and seen it on foodie call, but I needed to try it for myself. I was not disappointed! The food was amazing! It was healthy and tasted great! To top it off the staff was equally awesome! I will definitely be returning in the near future!!"}
{"text":"Food is great as always... i just wanted to give props the Yvonne and the staff for taking care of my family and i... first time for my family doing viva. Very informative and nice folk...the food is a no brainer, Yvonne was outstanding!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Huge portions.  Great flavor!!  Nice staff.  Patio seating available.  This location gets super crowded but they move fast.  Consider ordering online/via phone for faster service.  Limited parking. Wish they stayed open later than 9 pm, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Be adventurous and try the in house juice blends. Yum! Also don't overlook the side items like I did and miss out on the yucca or plantains. Kid friendly with highchairs. Oh and it's all about the sauces."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. I usually get the 1/2 chicken with infused rice and sweet plantains and it is very filling. The herbal infused lemonade is overrated in my opinion. I don't like the taste. It'll be nice if they introduce some special hot sauce for the chicken and rice (they only have mild and medium)."}
{"text":"So yummy every time!! We love it here... And there is always a large selection too choose from. The kitchen is a little loud considering there's always cooking and informing each other and there is no sound barrier (glass, wall, etc.) but it is pretty good from me!!!"}
{"text":"This place makes the best rotisserie chicken in south Charlotte and the place is always packed at lunchtime. Even with it being so busy the line moves quickly, food comes out in about 10min and the quality doesn't suffer."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good! I had the quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken and it was awesome! People have said that it was hard to find seating but if you go after the lunch crowd you\"ll be all good."}
{"text":"The quinoa-stuffed avocado is delish! Can't wait to try it with chicken"}
{"text":"This place is awesome -- best service I got in town (even though the people here doesn't work for tips, as you pay before you get food etc), and best food I had in a long while!  Definitely try their chickens (I mean, they have it in their store name for a reason!), Peruvian drinks are nice, and the classic saltado is neat as well.  Will come back to Charlotte for them :)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The customer service I have to say was excellent, and I didn't have any complaints except for one. I asked for ketchup assuming that I was gonna be getting a bottle or one of those squeeze bottles that you see at some restaurant. I was brought small packs of ketchup. It made me shake my head. But over all the food was good along with everything else."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant the food is delish and we love the family oriented environment. Have ordered there tons of times and I have never been disappointed. The staff is really friendly and the prices are affordable. Location is also a plus to next to the mall and Walmart.
My favorite juice is the passion fruit a must try."}
{"text":"Service was great! Our first time because of a gift card, otherwise we wouldn't know about it. Tried the 3 sauces and they are delicious. The quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken has a delicious sauce. Will be back tonight for more!"}
{"text":"Filled with college kids. Good sign. Very crowded. Good sign. Healthy options. Good sign. I walked in somewhat confused. Long line. Finally made my way to the front where I picked up a to-go order. I have a family to feed. 4 to be exact. 5-6 if friends are over. Bojangles and Popeyes just won't do. Fried chicken gets boring. The family meal is on point. This chicken is king. Thank you Viva Chicken."}
{"text":"Love this place! My to go place in Charlotte. I always get the quarter white chicken and quinoa stuffed avocados :)"}
{"text":"Talk about one of the best places to eat in Charlotte! Viva Chicken is one of the best values in town. For a great price, the meal is filling, fairly healthy if the correct sides are chosen and a great atmosphere. I recommend checking them out. I will be going back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Delicious Delicious!  Better than some of the formal sit down restaurants around.  The food is so good fresh and the  staff was so nice and attentive.  I went to both the Concord and Huntersville  location.  The CHICHA MORADA and HERBAL LIMEADE juice was so good.  This is my new favorite spot in the Charlotte area :)"}
{"text":"My husband son and I decided to drive into town after reading the reviews here on Yelp. We are so glad we did! It was only a twenty minute drive and well worth it. We had excellent service and the wait was quite acceptable for a Friday night. The food all around was delish even my fifteen y.o. was very happy. The sauces definitely turn it up a notch and we all had fun trying the different flavor combos. Our favorite was the Gringo Killer. We'll definitely be back for more of that and the Herbal Lemonade it was so so good."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Viva Chicken yesterday. The place was packed and we were worried about finding a table, but no issue. I had the Viva Tacu Bowl with chicken which was perfect with the huacatay sauce. My wife had the white meat quarter chicken with beans and infused rice. Her chicken was a bit dried out, but the overall meal was very good.We both had the herbal lemonade with basil, mint and rosemary. This in itself is a reason to return. Prices are reasonable, so I don't know how anyone can complain. We were too full for dessert, maybe next time! All and all, good food, great concept...they should think of moving to a larger location."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a 3.5. I had the arroz chaufa which was really good.  I felt it had too much red onions for my liking, but it was still really good. The sweet plantains were amazing (drooling). The yuca fries was alright. It wasn't season at all except with salt which you could barely taste. The atmosphere was nice and family friendly. People started to show up as soon as the place open meaning this a good place. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"ok so since my very first visit to Viva Chicken I have been addicted.. what are they putting in the chicken!! and sauces, don't get me started..

I love it when something so simple is done so well and Viva Chicken has done it. while they offer a variety of menu items from stuffed avocados, to salads and unique sandwiches, My favorite is of course the 1/4 Chicken with 1 green sauce (on the spicy side) and 1 yellow ( milder) sauce. The chicken is seasoned to perfection and you can taste a variety of herbs and spices in  the sauces. I also love the herbal lemonade because of the fresh herbs including basil mixed in.My favorite side is the yucca which comes with another yummy sauce or the infused rice. I try to get the green beans or salad most of the time to keep it healthy but after an after work run the yucca along with the chicken hits the spot.
  
These guys have something awesome here and maybe one day they will open more locations which I think would be a great fast casual competitor to a Boston Market or something Like Zoe's kitchen because their food is definitely great tasting and fresh.
the churros aren't half bad either."}
{"text":"Excellent location, great food! The outdoor seating area is really nice as well. I like to get the half chicken with two sides, or their famous rice."}
{"text":"So glad to have Viva Chicken in Ballantyne. Food is fresh, service was great. Unique favors, sandwiches and plates and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have been hearing my coworkers rave about this place for weeks so when Girls Night came around I jumped at the opportunity to visit VIVA Chicken. I ordered the quarter chicken with sweet plantains and a house salad. I was not disappointed. The sweet plantains were delicious, just like my grandma makes them!! The chicken had great flavor and was oh so tender! 

We sat outside on the super cute patio. The servers came out and refilled our drinks and were very attentive. I also love that they have eco-friendly serveware and they recycle. 

I would definitely recommend trying it. Keep you the good work Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"Popular fast casual dining restaurant.  Try the green limeade! Love the quinoa stuffed avocado salad.  Refreshing ad perky flavors."}
{"text":"This is my second review. The first one was positive for the most part but I don't have many good things to say this time. I've been going into the park road location regularly since my first visit and it's gone down hill since - or my first visit was just lucky. Nobody at the registers knew anything about the menu and didn't give me a straight answer on anything I asked. And then got my order wrong. It took so long to get my to go order the first time I didn't even bother getting it fixed, the food was okay but I could tell it was sitting in the box for a while. While I was waiting an employee came to check on me and told me there were a lot of new people working there. Makes sense since nobody at the register could answer my question! The people who took my orders before were knowledgeable and polite and this visit ruined viva for me. Viva should spend more time training and keeping their employees happy enough to stay instead of hiring a ton of new people. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it first opened and it never disappoints! My favorite is the WOW Lomito Sandwich (Marinated Steak Strips). If you want some magical goodness add avocado and yellow sauce(yourself). Next would be the stuffed avocado with chicken. The cilantro infused rice and rotisserie chicken are always on point. Every once in a while I may order their fries which are soooo crispy and good they remind you of the bootie call you want - she comes over - she leaves and you're left with about 30 seconds of guilt. You're watching your weight and you know you shouldn't do it but DAMN - those fries were good!"}
{"text":"Excellent food for a weekday lunch! The prices hovered around $11 for meal and drink, but the slight bump in price was well worth it. Excellent chicken in both dishes that my husband and I tried. Plenty of fresh ingredients and creative combinations. The sauce variety was fun and delicious, and the unique drinks and deserts were all tempting. 

Seating is limited during peak lunch hours, but the crowd seemed to move pretty quickly. 

We found abundant street parking a block or so from the restaurant (and the police were definitely checking the parking meters)."}
{"text":"NEW FAVORITE PLACE!!! The chicken is amazing, but its the healthy options and choice of sauces that puts this place over the top. The stuffed avocados topped with chicken is one of the best meals I've ever had without the guilt of eating a high calorie meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely stellar food.  Love to eat here.  Downside is extreme crowding and overheating inside Btyne one.  That's tough.  Call ahead !!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Chicken was perfectly seasoned. Sauces are exceptional. Cilantro infused rice is my favorite side. I was skeptical that my kids would like it. They are picky eaters that are ages13 and 8, but they loved it as well."}
{"text":"Viva chicken was excellent and great customer service! Quinoa (sp may be off) stuffed Avocado was sooo good! I suggest that if you like avocados! I had the Classic Saltado and it was great! My husband had the tallerain Saltado and that was good too! I will def be going back!"}
{"text":"Viva la chicken, viva la life! This fast casual style restaurant is a healthier, tastier alternative to the other mass produced crap you can find in any major American city. It is in a trendy location with a trendy interior that offers clean inside and outside seating if you don't want to take your food to go.

Ordering is quick and simple and service is even quicker. I ordered a quarter chicken with sweet plantains and chicken soup as the sides. The chicken soup was an interesting take on a classic. It was chock full of vegetables with very tender chicken and a hearty broth, but something missed the mark. Maybe it was a lack of grain that took away from the more traditional chicken noodle soup I am used to. The plantains were average, but the rotisserie chicken was above average. The skin was crispy, not really oily or overly fatty like many other chicken restaurants. It was spiced well and the meat fell tenderly off of the bone. Definitely one of the better rotisserie chickens I have ever consumed but you do get what you pay for and it is more expensive then what you can find somewhere else. Their signature sauces are an added bonus to the meal. Their mild sauce (with hints of garlic and a touch of heat) was the best. I did not try their medium (some sort of green sauce) and their hot was comparable to medium sauces at most other places. It lacked the dynamic flavor that the mild sauce had.

My girlfriend ordered the quinoa stuffed avocado with an added portion of chicken. It is definitely one of the more unique items on the menu and I was taken aback when it was served. They really do put a full avocado on the plate and they dress it nicely with their signature sauce and chicken. My girlfriend greatly enjoyed this healthy eating option, but for someone like me who is not very partial to large doses of avocado it was very overpowering.

If I lived in the area, I could see this restaurant becoming a go-to favorite for a healthy take out meal option."}
{"text":"Best food ever fast and healthy. I cant even describe how in live i am with there food and service."}
{"text":"I had to review this place again... I normally get fries and the cilantro rice as my sides, but tonight I decided to change it up a bit. After reading great reviews on the green beans and plantains, I decided to give both a try and glad I did.  I can't really say anything negative about this place. Everything here is pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to Viva Chicken.

For months, my husband has been encouraging me to have a meal here. His work caters Viva Chicken frequently and he always raves about the wraps and green sauce.

So two weeks ago, we went to the Elizabeth location. I was IMMEDIATELY hooked. I have even dreamed about the place! Since then, we've been 2 more times (Cooper Way location). The Naked Peruvian wrap is amazing, as are the quinoa avocados and ever single side I've tried (hint: they're all delicious). 

I would smother that green sauce on every single thing I eat for the rest of my life, and it still wouldn't be enough. I crave it like nothing else. 

Yesterday, my husband texted me and said he was headed to Viva Chicken for lunch, so I put in my order. Well, he seemed to have missed the text so he graciously offered me the other half of his Naked Peruvian wrap that he didn't get to finish. He then told me that giving up that food was one of the hardest things he's ever done in his life.

So yeah, you all have something amazing going on. If I was a millionaire, I'd buy a franchise for the end of my street. 

Thank you for delicious, healthy, AMAZING food."}
{"text":"Man... My friend introduced me to this after playing golf. Been hooked ever since! I live in Indian Trail, NC so it's not easy to get to this side of town. But when I do, I make sure to take a tacu bowl home with the sauces. Great place and service!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is supposed to be an authentic Peruvian restaurant...and it's not. You can tell whether or not a Peruvian restaurant is legit by their Lomo Saltado. Lomo is one of the best Peruvian dishes. However, the Lomo served here is not good. The meat was tough, very tough. The tomatoes and onions were barely cooked. The sauce was ok. I was very disappointed to find that one of the few Peruvian restaurants in Charlotte was this bad and this highly rated on Yelp. 
As a fellow Yelper mentioned in their review, this place is, at best, a Pollo Tropical (South Florida)."}
{"text":"Got some lunch for me and the family this past Monday and quickly realized this is one of my favorite restaurants in the area!!

The place is very clean and the people here are very friendly and helpful.  I ordered a whole roasted chicken with 3 sides, which were White Rice, Yuca Fries and Maduros.  I paid $22.00 for this delicious feast!!  The chicken was absolutely perfect!!  Very tender and juicy inside, yet perfectly roasted outside!!  The white rice was as good as white rice can get, next time I'll try their seasoned rice (can't remember what they call it).  The Yuca fries were very good and so were the maduros.  But the star of the show was their dipping sauce!!  The mild sauce was fabulous and was a big hit with us!!

Overall, I think it's a great place, well-priced and they serve delicious food.  Might stop by for lunch today again!!

Nice job Viva Chicken!!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town.  Chicken is delicious and I love the sauce with the salad, the cilantro rice is amazing, and sangria is pretty good too.  The best part, it's not expensive at all.  You get a lot of food for the price.  My bf and I love to pick this up when we are too busy to cook anything."}
{"text":"Wow, this place's food is quite unbelievably good.  Everyone I take here loves it too!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't great, when we ordered I guess they forgot to give us a number so when the guy came out to give the food he told us it wasn't ours even though it was (he didn't speak great english either) There seems to be a lot of staff hanging around as well, like they had too many people working that shift. Food is OK, I got the Amazon Caesar and they forgot to give me my dressing for it, even though the place was mostly empty. My mom loved her rice bowl though. Not sure if I'll be back to be honest."}
{"text":"My favorite quick stop shop. Chicken is the truth. Service is also cool, workers are clean and polite. This chicken is better than sex. I fux witcha!!!"}
{"text":"I will be back! This was my first time and their customer service was great! They even told me how to earn points for a free Chica Morada (purple corn drink). I ordered the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado, 1/4 chicken with plantain, and cilantro infused rice! This food was beautiful packaged and I'm sold! O yes, try the Chica Morada it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Service and location are excellent.  The quinoa stuffed avocado's were fantastic and I would recommend them for an app, but they are rich so sharing with up to 4 people is definitely possible.  The food otherwise I felt was good.  I wasn't overly excited for this food though the people I ate with really enjoyed it.  $30 fed 3 of us with leftovers so definitely great value."}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Fast, friendly staff. Very yummy food. This is as close to authentic Peruvian rotisserie I've had yet in Charlotte.  Half chicken with green beans and yuca fries. The green beans were crisp and had a vague Asian style/ginger flavor. The yuca fries were so tender! I'm used to yuca bring flash fried and have a tough, veiny exterior - a pleasant difference!  Everyone on staff was very working and would walk around cleaning, checking in with guests, and taking half a second to joke with coworkers. It's obvious they enjoy what they do. Bathrooms are clean, but single stalls. The music is an upbeat techno (do people even use that word anymore?) and low lights - I felt like there was a nightclub nearby."}
{"text":"Delicious food; clean, friendly environment; and sustainable products. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Fresh, tender chicken. Large menu considering it's primarily chicken. Healthy options and salads for an easy weekday meal. Especially loved the quinoa stuffed avocado and churros!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile.  I live in Huntersville and CAN'T wait for that location to open!  My coworker and I went for lunch and it was everyhing I expected & more.  I got the quarter chicken, infused rice and fried plantains.  I will say, I didn't like the plantains so much as they were a bit mushy.  The chicken and rice however, were on point!  I can't wait to go back--and next time I will be getting the quinoa stuffed avacado!"}
{"text":"If I'm ever around this neighborhood I would definitely be back again!!! Everything was good. Only thing is wasn't hot. The rice was Luke warm and the fried plantains was also. Besides that it was tasteful"}
{"text":"Always great food and great service. Food is always hot and fresh. 

Surprise of the menu - how good the French fries are. 

Order the inca wrap and you'll be happy.

And... this location has the most efficient layout."}
{"text":"This is not another review to sing the praises of VC.  I wanted to share 2 hacks if you were going to order the Andina Power food salad (and I suggest you do)

First- if you order the salad with Rotisserie chicken, the portions are huge and you could easily get 2 meals out of a $9 salad.  Not bad.

Second- if you are a vegan ( yes we know, you're vegan) order to-go with the quinoa on the side and they fill up the bowl with the hole left where the quinoa normally is.  Mostly lettuce but with a good distribution of toppings as well.  

Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love it but it was just ok.  Not bad but just ok.  In general I've had peruvian at several east coast and Florida places and this one was slightly bland.  Maybe they're catering to a more conservative population, who might not care for salt.  I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Food was good and staff was helpful in helping my decision on what to order. I had the appetizer of an avocado with quinoa on top and added chicken on top I that an made it an entree. Highly recommend the dish."}
{"text":"This place was really good! My boyfriend and I went during the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday. It was rather crowded and seating was a bit hard to find. I had the pork loin sandwich with sweet potato fries. I had to pick quite a few onions off the sandwich because there were SO many; it was still super tasty. Boyfriend had the half chicken, infused rice, and fresh fruit. He was really satisfied. I highly recommend the herbal lemonade! I was a bit intimidated when they gave it to me because of the green color but hang in there, it's awesome! The service was great. Everyone was super friendly and working hard to keep the busy space in order. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I am not sure how many people that have given this place such good ratings have ever been to Pio Pio, but as far as I am concerned it is not really that close of a contest.  Not that anything I had here was bad, but when comparing it to a place like Pio Pio, I think it is just average at best. I have eaten here twice tried things similar to I would get at Pio and just have not been impressed. The sauces, the chicken, the drinks I would prefer to eat at it's competitor.  Easiest way to put it, this is a 3 start place and Pio Pio is 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is unique and delicious! The restaurant is really nice inside and the patio area is beautiful! They serve wine! Woo hoo! Lots of Healthy options and delicious juice drinks!"}
{"text":"For a casual environment, this place will wow you with their excellent food.  Been here (and the other location) four times now. Have not been disappointed once with a single thing.  Actually, my only complaint is that it gets crowded with too many people. But that's because word spreads quickly when there is a great place to eat and - compared to all the pricey places in Charlotte - this one is a great choice.  This location has a cool / funky wall that appears to help with noise reduction and I really appreciated that as well.  Too many restaurants either ignore the issue or seem to encourage loud noise levels - which I hate.  This place tries to minimize it."}
{"text":"Got sick on the chicken, it tasted as it was spoiled ! Heard great reviews about this place and went their during B/trip. Maybe not used to Southern cooking , we all got real ill from this place ! The staff is really cool and gave us our money back. They didn't seem to notice the chicken was spoiled ! They must have iron stomachs in NC, maybe it was a bad week for chickens. Customers seemed happy with their chicken, as we could hear the happy groans of  NC eating their meals."}
{"text":"I loooove the place! They are super friendly and helpful! Never left the place without being happy. 
Dogs are allowed on the patio!!!"}
{"text":"While I was already a fan of Viva Chicken in Elizabeth. The Park Rd. Location is closer to me and they got a ton of staff and more room than their previous location. Great food, good customer service. Tried the inca wrap, yuca, and stuffed avocados. Do yourself and body a favor try the mint lemonade. All delicious!"}
{"text":"If I had the finances, I'd probably eat here almost every day. They have THE BEST, most tender, moist chicken and it's so flavorful! Omg, and the sauces?! I LOVE the green and yellow sauce. I always get extra. 
The papas huancainas is probable the best potato dish I've ever had in my life. I order it EVERY time. The downside is the cilantro infused rice isn't very cilantro-y. There are specs in there, but you can't really taste it. 
The people are friendly and the restaurant provides a relaxing environment. Definately a must-eat."}
{"text":"4.5 stars... My little family dined at Viva Chicken last evening on the recommendation of a coworker; I'm so happy we did. I just looked up the reviews while enjoying the leftovers, and was surprised to see so few reviews so far (though I know they just opened recently). We had a great experience, the people at the counter happily answered questions about the menu and were very accommodating (they're still working on a kids' menu). My husband tried the 1/4 chicken with fries and beans, and I tried the Arroz Chaufa, both of which were delicious - great flavors! We thought the prices were very reasonable and serving sizes generous (enough for a full lunch for me today, still yummy). It took a little while for our food to come out (not compared to a sit down restaurant, but perhaps for a counter-style place), but we were still very pleased with the friendly service throughout our meal (stopped by a few times to check in to see if we needed anything and to clear items from our table). Easy (and free) parking in the lot across the street. We'll be back..."}
{"text":"This place is really good! The staff is friendly, fast and efficient. The food is really tasty, especially with the sauces! I'd recommend Viva Chicken for lunch or a quick dinner, there's something for everyone on their menu."}
{"text":"Love the rotisserie chicken and sauces. Everything we've tried has been good. The employees are extremely helpful"}
{"text":"The food is good but the portions are terrible - especially on the $10.00 chicken salad."}
{"text":"If you eat in here it is wonderful - food proportions are large - and the price is excellent.  The flavors are WONDERFUL!!!  Highly recommend - but dine in - carry out is still a bit skimpy with proportions."}
{"text":"Can't say enough!!  Awesome food!  Great to have a healthy option!"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite places. The last two times we have come something has been off.  With everything.  This is my first ever review. That's how disappointed I am. What's up Viva?? Where is the flavor?  Please fix it. Fast!! We all will be back if you do!"}
{"text":"I'm not a Charlotte native...but was on a quest for peruvian food. Lomo Saltado to be exact. It was too salty...great portion, but too salty borderline inedible."}
{"text":"I fantasize about this place in my free time.
Viva Chicken consistently puts out delicious and healthy food. Their staff is courteous, friendly and thankful. I suggest Viva Chicken to anyone and everyone in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken consistently puts out delicious and healthy food. Their staff is courteous, friendly and thankful. I suggest Viva Chicken to anyone and everyone in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Thumbs up!
Cashier was friendly recommending dishes and the food (chicken, beans and soup) tastes great! Will come back for more."}
{"text":"Nothing but great food and service!! Love this place! Consistently delicious every time we go. I plan to try everything on their menu...so far I've not been disappointed. Yum!"}
{"text":"So many points to make...where to start?!
1. LOVE that all of their plates, silverware, to-go boxes, etc. are compostable. 
2. Appreciate that they have a couple of vegan options and/or ways to make something vegan -- even though they aren't a vegan establishment.
3. While the non-vegans I dined with loved the cuisine, mine was just ok. The Inca Wrap was good...but I personally don't care for carrots & peas in my rice (yes, even though I'm vegan).
4. Last, but definitely not least, THE SERVICE WAS AMAZING! One girl helped right when we got in -- noticing that we had a baby with us. Made sure we snatched a table for 4, and brought us over a high chair. The bussers were there every time we turned around -- making sure everything tasted fine, cleared our plates, and grabbed us a to-go box. And I wanted to give a shoutout to Juan at the register. I told him I was vegan after placing my order, so he went through the individual ingredients to make sure they were all vegan...and recommended a side he knew was vegan...all with a smile on his face. :) So thanks, Juan!"}
{"text":"love, Love, LOVE Viva Chicken! It's an easy gathering place for friends, an awesome place for families and a go-to take out spot. From the chicken, yummy yucca and plantain that my one year old and I like and the the butifarra my husband digs to the chocolate almonds that we all can't get enough of ... we go to VC pretty much every week! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food. Quick and tasty! Though it may be quick it is not fast food, it fast good food Lol. If you're in the area try it, if you're not still try it!!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken continues to be one of my favorite rotisserie houses in the city of Charlotte. The ambiance is upbeat and postmodern. The food is tasty and consistently prepared. The service far exceeds other restaurants with a comparable price point."}
{"text":"Be prepared for delicious flavor and large portions. Look like a pro when you know there are several dipping sauces: mild, medium, hot. Don't be scared - hot isn't all that spicy! Truthfully, it's closer to what you expect for mild. Super flavorful and enjoyable without the fire."}
{"text":"Take it from the other great reviews- this place doesn't need much explaining, it's fantastic. Don't wait, just go to Viva Chicken, order anything on the menu that looks good, try all the sauces, try a tea or lemonade and leave happy, it's really that simple!"}
{"text":"The BEST AND I MEAN BEST Peruvian restaurant in Charlotte!!!! Love this place. The food is fresh and great tasting. The staff are friendly and I will always come here as long as they keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  The food here is terrific ... for what it is.  Don't come looking for high end cuisine.  But if you're in the mood for a bit of \"south American street flavor\" (a little more refined and packaged than that, but that's the theme).

Some of their sauces/sides are ridiculous.  

Outstanding creativity in combining their ingredients.

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great! Excellent food, everything I tried tastes awesome, high quality ingredients, the place is always super clean and the staff is super friendly,     the sweet potato fries are something else. A must when in this side of town."}
{"text":"This is one my my most favorite joints in Charlotte.. The simple yet explosive (flavor wise) menu combined with some superb drinks and sauces.. The herbal lemonade is out of the world.. If I am not trying to experiment and just want some awesome food, Viva Chicken is the place."}
{"text":"Vegan Friendly!

Been many times. Staff is always in a good mood, knowledgable and happy to please. Quick to fix any issues too. PR is on point. Prices are reasonable and portions are generous. Thank You!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here for lunch.  The food is always great as well as the customer service. Would recommend to anyone.  I also love their herbal lemonade."}
{"text":"First time here and we'll be back. 

We both got the 1/4 chicken and 2 sides - rice, canary beans(?), yucca, plantains. And Sangria. 

Pros: With the exception of the beans, everything was really good (+ Sangria). Comes with 2 sauces which were also very good.

Cons: Beans were average. But there are other sides to try out."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, but the service was not. In addition to taking almost 30 minutes to fill my order (2 sandwiches and fries), the person taking my order answered call-in orders as I was in the middle of giving mine. At one point, both order takers were on the phone while people in line waited. I don't blame them as they were decent people, but clearly the management hasn't thought this through very clearly.

Ordered 2 Greats and the Tres Leche dessert is outstanding. Too bad the service was so slow as it spoils an otherwise good experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful food with wonderful service!

Let's visit Viva...

Parking is a headache waiting to happen. Just pull your vehicle around back and avoid the nightmare in the front parking area.

Viva's entry is a bit Showmarsesque...in that you feel a bit packed in a hallway, waiting to get on a ride. However, who doesn't like to get on the rides? The bustling atmosphere of Viva is a combination of their customers and the layout of the establishment. Everything is moving, energy is created...and you feel like you're in a place that is going to offer you something everyone wants.

Fortunately for Viva...we do want it! The food here is great! They are smart in their approach to food here. Rotisserie chicken? How do you mess up juicy rotisserie chicken? Everything they make...they make in a foolproof manner. This is impressive to me...and l enjoy eating at places that have smart people running them.

I could go on about the food...but every sentence would end in, \"perfectly done, great, fantastic, can't go wrong.\" 

If you enjoy great food and energetic places...Viva is for you. 

Try: Anything

Avoid: The lunchtime rush"}
{"text":"Peruvian chicken finally arrived.  We ate before at a different location now it is so close to home.  Healthy & Delicious rotisserie chicken and fresh sides. 

I usually order \"The Great\" wrap, with avocado, so good!  Staff is always friendly and the food is always fresh and delicious.  We can finally eat and take-out healthy with the kids when they want to eat semi-fast food!  I highly recommend, beware weekends dinner time crowded, but they are fast!"}
{"text":"5 stars every single time! I always order one of the two options: stuffed avocados with chicken or half of chicken with rice, beans, yuca sides and herbal lemonade. The employees of this location are very helpful and friendly! The managers are always there and make sure that the place runs smoothly."}
{"text":"I'm completely hooked on this place.  Really good flavors and altogether healthy, provided you get the right sides.

Great place.  They need to add a way for people that place carry out orders to get their food without waiting in line.  Kind of defeats the purpose of calling in.  Other than that, one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Flavorful answer to quick dining with a decent sangria and different beverage offerings than a classic soda bar. Loved their use of spices."}
{"text":"Tried Viva Chicken for the first time on Friday and it was amazing.  Everything we had to eat was full of flavor and the service was exceptional.  Not to mention, the atmosphere and design of the restaurant alone will keep us coming back.  We have already returned once, and it has not even been a week since our first visit!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh the staff is super and for price you won't find better value for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This location provides the best customer service every time I go in (at least once a week). There's an employee named Natalie that always greets me with a smile and a positive attitude. They all do though! Keep it up Viva on Elizabeth Ave! You're doing a great job!"}
{"text":"An amazing and tasty restaurant. Highly recommend the Quinoa avocados and \"The Great\" sandwich. The juices are equally delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is always fresh and delicious.  I have tried salads, sandwiches and wraps...all of which are wonderful.  However,  my go to is the white meat chicken with fresh fruit and plantains...it's divine.  My only critique (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is the small space and the awkward layout. The placement of the drink counter makes it difficult to maneuver, especially during peak hours like weekday lunch. The atmosphere can be quite hectic and stressful if you visit during a peak time, but the food is certainly worth it."}
{"text":"I knew I loved this place the first time I tasted the chicken-The soup is incredible, and I am not generally a soup person. The portions are great, and it is always fresh. But when I visited recently with my 88 year old Mom, who had recently had a stroke, struggling with speech and mobility, the owners treated us like Royalty! I was almost brought to tears by their generosity and kindness. This will always be my Go To Viva chicken! Please try it-you will love it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Viva Chicken and used to drive to Elizabeth a few times a month to eat there...well the drive is over. Now I have one right next door.
I haven't ventured far from my favorite dish, 1/4 white with green beans and side salad. But that alone is reason enough for me to return time after time. 
As boring as this meal may sound to some it truly hits the spot and keeps me CLOSE to my healthy eating plans. 
I love to double dip my chicken into the yellow mild, then the green medium and a drop of red to top it off. The green sauce is perfect as the salad dressing giving it a mildly spicy kick that won't burn your buds. But the real deal is to top the green beans with just a touch of the mild yellow and VOILA...its the perfect amount of flavor and a TINY bit of heat."}
{"text":"Niiiiceee!!!! Great food, setting, & it's a busy place! It's good to order ahead if you don't have a lot of time"}
{"text":"Food is great but bad customer service. I came in to pick up an online order and waited an additional 20 minutes before I was even was acknowledged (it wasn't even busy). I went to the cashier and told him that I was picking up an order and he told me to wait as someone was walking in to place an order. The gentleman that was coming in even said that I was here first but the cashier (young guy) continued to take his order. I spoke to the manager and all he said was that he was going to talk to him about it. Disappointed. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Very good rotisserie chicken!  I've always been a Pio Pio fan, but was persuaded to try Viva Chicken by friends. I'll definitely go back. Easy place to grab lunch during the week, although the lines can get long. They move people through without sacrificing quality or making anyone feel rushed."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! The food and service are always on point.  The quinoa stuffed avocado is unbeatable! The yuka and plantains are always great and the chicken is superb.  A+!"}
{"text":"Found this place in Yelp...fantastic chicken, fresh green beans and brown rice. Will definitely be back again when I'm in the area. 

I wrote this original review almost two years ago to the day. Upon returning to Charlotte for business I knew I had to eat here again. It did not disappoint in fact even better than I recall. Wish they had a location in Minnesota. LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"Huge fan!!!! I've eaten here several times. Never had a bad meal. The chicken is amazing. Fried rice...yum! Stuffed avocados...delicious! Great lunch spot. Not a long wait, regardless of how busy it is. Definitely a spot to check out!"}
{"text":"Treated myself to a delicious lunch at Viva Chicken today after my mammogram (deserved the treat!).  I had never been to Viva before so the manager's advice on the menu was friendly and spot-on.  I had the Andina Quinoa Salad with pulled chicken without raisons or onions.   Delicious!   I can't wait to take my family and try other menu options!....I just saw Mike R's review from today.  I'm happy to say I definitely did not have that experience but I had already talked to the manager (who approached me when I looked confused) when I came into the restaurant so I was prepared with my order."}
{"text":"I work for a large financial firm in Charlotte and Viva Chicken on Park Road catered our lunch for 40 employees and executives last week.  I admit, I was a little nervous about using them for the first time to cater such an important event but they came thru like champs!  They were on time, set up the service beautifully, provided plenty of utensils and sauces, and the food itself was really tasty and plentiful.  I heard so much positive feedback from my team. Most had never had VC before but they've already told me to add them to our unofficial list of preferred caterers.  Fyi, we had the quarter chicken, cilantro rice, canary beans, house salad and passion fruit juice.  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today.  It is a busy place.  The food is good and mostly healthy for \"fast\" food which is hard to find at times.  I thought the price was a little high for portions.  The rotisserie chicken in my dish could have been a larger portion IMO."}
{"text":"I used the order online and take out feature. I ordered from the parking lot across the street (Lifetime) and selected the 7:30 pick up window. I was there to pick up my food by 7:23pm and it was ready! The chicken wrap and sweet potato fries were absolutely delicious. Everything was hot and fresh. For a special treat, don't forget your special sauce!"}
{"text":"Love the quinoa stuffed avocados and the purvian (sp?) wrap is sooo good!  They have the best French fries too! Nice and crispy on the outside and great dipping sauces!  Definitely a place I recommend giving a try if you haven't been!"}
{"text":"This is a good Peruvian Restaurant and the flavor profiles are good.  The restaurant seems cramped and the typical fast food or fast casual feel to it. the food was good overall but, the chicken seemed a little salty on the skin. The veggies were lime overdose to a point with the bite in the back of my jaw like a lemon would do.  
However, the presentation and overall satisfaction of having a different restaurant selection is welcomed and I would suggest you trying.  
Portioning sizes are good and well thought out."}
{"text":"I had the 1/4 chicken with cilantro rice, and green beans.  It was delicious!  If you are looking for fast, healthy, and delicious food, you have to visit Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  I assumed it would just be a standard place with chicken, but the chicken is extremely well made and tasty.

The first time I went I was eating vegetarian, and their Quinoa Stuffed Avocado was amazing.  I tend to eat a lot, so if you (like me) area always hungry, it would probably be best to order more than just that.  My husband always gets the Arroz Chaufa with chicken and can't get enough.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've gone twice in the past week and this is now my new \"go to\" place for fast casual.   

I had \"The Great\", a wrap with pulled chicken.  Best chicken I've ever eaten!  Second time I had the Arroz Chaufa...it doesn't seem very Peruvian...more like Chinese Fried rice....but the flavor is amazing.   I got it with the chicken which was amazing.  Don't forget the salsas...delicious.  

Portions are big.  Not the cheapest, but a great value.  

I used the online ordering, so you just get to the register and your order is waiting for you.   Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This place has become one of my favorite places and is in my weekly rotation.

The Low Lomito is awesome.  I also love the 1/2 chicken w/ cilantro rice.  But their tres leche cake is the best in town.

Now that they offer online ordering, this is one of my top 3 favorite carryout spots.

Awesome food!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this location since it's near my job. I always have received great service from the waitress's and waiters. 

But recently I went in with my family for my lunch break & I was not happy. The girl that was at the register and that brought our food out must have been new. She was a young African American, and I believe she had glasses on.

When she brought our food out she didn't bring it all out at once, & when I asked for the silverware she told me I had to go get it inside the restaurant. I looked confused because I had never received an attitude from any of the employees. The Hispanic waitress must have heard the young lady direct me to go inside to get my fork. So the Hispanic woman instead quickly went inside the restaurant and brought out napkins and silverware out to our table."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and pretty good place. The flavors are interesting and the chicken is cooked well. The kids menu could be a little better though."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. The chicken is delicious, as are the sides. The taku bowl is just amazing. Honestly, haven't had a thing I didn't like. Great food at a great value."}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch. Ordered the Inca Wrap and a side salad with passion fruit vinaigrette. Service was ok (cashier seemed distracted and had to confirm my order twice). Food arrived to my table quickly. I had taken my daughter to the restroom and the food was there when I returned. I didn't like the idea of my food being left unattended in a restaurant full of strangers. After brief inspection, it looked fine, so I dived in. The wrap was delicious and so large I could only eat half. The salad was fresh and the dressing was very good. I liked the food and will return to try other menu options."}
{"text":"Try the Tallarin Saltado for a delicious vegan meal! It's amazing and never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I'm going to have to poo poo on all the hype and ecstatic reviews on this one.  Viva Chicken is just not all that!  I heard great things before visiting and had pretty high expectations.  My experience however was underwhelming, to say the least.  The menu options were minimal.  The chicken, not \"all that\".  It was also highly overpriced.  Overall, highly overrated.  Sorry folks, I wanted to like it.. but I couldn't even finish the meal.  Upon leaving, I actually went and ate somewhere else.  Yuck."}
{"text":"Yum. I come here mainly for the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado salad with the pulled chicken and the sauces. The sauces are out of this world, I could write sonnets if I had any poetic inclinations. They have a nice variety to the menu and the herbal limeade is really good, too. I wasn't as over the moon about the Maracuya (Passionfruit) drink and the dark purple Chicha Morada (corn, cinnamon, clove, pineapple, lime) drink, but I am glad that they have them to switch things up on occasion. Those drinks are sometimes served a little warm, so I tend to grab some ice at the self serve fountain to chill it some more. Don't be too afraid to come in when the line is a little long, it moves fast. It's a little claustrophobic in there, so try to get a table out of the way- or just get your stuff to go."}
{"text":"It is my #2 Favorite grub in Charlotte! There are so many health options. The food is so fresh and clean eating! I feel guilt free everytime. The music is pumping, they have outdoor seating, you must try all of the sauces! I am a HUGE fan of the Avocado stuffed quinoa, with or without pulled chicken. Also I adore the plantains YUMMMMMM. I truly think about this place at least once a day and I pimp it out to everyone I know! Try it YOU must!!!!! Last but certainly not least the people who work there have top notch  EXCELENT service. They are above and beyond. They are very knowledgable if you have questions and I have even had the. Give me sample tastes of certain things I was curious about. Everytime I have eaten there, I have been greeted table side during my meal by a manager asking how things were. Again this is above the rest. I am a lifer!!!! Mmmmmmmm Viva is my jam"}
{"text":"This quickly became a weekly favorite of mine after my first visit and I have hooked all of my family on it. The Wow Lomito is aptly named because somewhere between the marinated stir fired sirloin and onion with tomato and Rocoto mayo on fresh baked Ciabatta Bread the world slows down for sec and I think... WOW. 

The La Butifarra and the Classic Saltado share equal space in second place but can easily hold there own if I'm feeling like mixing it up a little for the night. Check this place out if you haven't already, you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken with salad and fries. I'm not sure what my husband ordered but we enjoyed everything. I also ordered the Maracuya drink. Do not leave without trying it! It was very refreshing. forgot to mention the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Shout out to Daniel one of the managers.
Best salads and great cookies.  We enjoyed our dinner and the  service is great.   We will be back soon for more delicious food."}
{"text":"Amazing spot in Charlotte. Kendra and Justin were very helpful for a first time guest. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent choice. Ordered the ARROZ CHAUFA
for myself, and the rotisserie chicken with sweet potato fries from the kids meal for my daughter. Was very impressed with the ARROZ CHAUFA. Could not finish it. Healthy portion they give you. Will happily save the rest of lunch for the next day. My daughter was very satisfied with her meal."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonably priced. All of the staff we encountered were very sweet. They genuinely listened and were patient. The only issue I had was the music was a little loud. Other than that it is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Yesssss! Thank you Viva Chicken for opening a location in the south side of the city! Furthermore, thank you for opening a location walking distance from my home!

My husband and I finally got to check out Viva Chicken for dinner on Sunday. This was just as amazing as the Elizabeth location. There was a little bit of a line, but it moved fairly quickly.

For drinks, I got the sangria and my husband got a Corona. The sangria was really delicious and a nice sized drink! For food, we split the 1/2 chicken with chicken soup and sweet potato fries. 

As we were waiting for the food, we got the \"stop light\" of sauces. The yellow one was definitely my favorite! The chicken was perfectly cooked. Even better dipped in the sauce. The sweet potato fries were also delish! However, the winner was the chicken soup. I can't even describe how amazing this is! What's so awesome is it is super basic. Chicken broth, rice, chicken, veggies, cilantro. It is just so much better than your average run of the mill soup. I want to be sick just so I can make my husband get this soup for me!!!

We will 100% be back! Great job Viva Chicken on another location!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how I have lived in Charlotte this long and have not been to Viva Chicken until last night! I love this place!!

After perusing our Charlotte restaurant bucket list (yes, we literally have a list on our fridge), we decided to check out Viva Chicken. Turned out to be a great choice!

Since it is Elizabeth, parking is never good. However, we were able to snag a street spot in front of the restaurant. I did notice that they also had a small side parking lot. Upon entering, we walked up to the counter to place our order, passing by the delicious looking chicken turning over and over roasting. 

Between my husband and I, we ordered the half quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken and the quarter chicken with green beans and chicken soup and the herbal lemonade. We then went to the sauce area to grab one of each of the sauces. Ya'll, these sauces are A-mazing!! The mild one was probably my favorite. The quinoa avocado with chicken was perfection. I love love love avocado and this was spot on delish. The sauces on it were a great combo. Next time, we are getting the full order! The quarter chicken was perfectly cooked and so tender. The green beans were nicely roasted. However, as crazy as it sounds, the winner of the night was the chicken soup. It was so basic (chicken, broth, veggies, rice) but so incredibly flavorful. Also, so glad I took the recommendation from a fellow Yelper to order the herbal lemonade cause it was delish! 

Excellent meal Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"Being from the DC area there are two things that I've always said Charlotte doesn't have enough of...Peruvian food and fast casual restaurants.  Viva Chicken delivers big time on both!  To test this place out, on my first visit I went with the classic quarter white, beans and cilantro rice.  The chicken was very moist and well seasoned.  They serve it with both the mild and medium sauces...couldn't decide which I liked better.  I was also impressed with the cilantro rice.  Beans I could take or leave but tried a friend's yucca...crispy outside, creamy center, delicious.  Second visit I tried the Viva Chicken Salad.  A large plate of greens topped with pulled chicken, feta, avocado, a little onion and tomato and their house dressing which is maybe a sweet balsamic. I'd take this salad over one from Crisp any day. Aside from the food, the staff is extremely courteous and helpful, the prices are very reasonable, the restaurant is eco-conscious and it doesn't hurt that it's next to my favorite music venue.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The green sauce is to die for (I would put it on anything!).  I have been to a lot of peruvian chicken places and this is by far the best one i've been to.  Their fried yucca is the fluffiest i have ever had."}
{"text":"Loved the stuffed avocados with chicken. The sauces are delicious and are out in containers so you can try them all. The rotisserie chicken and sided is a bit pricey for the potion size, green beans are great!"}
{"text":"If I'm ever back in charlotte again, I'll definitely come back here. Their rotisserie chicken has a spice rub that is so good that I want to cry! I had a half chicken with cilantro infused rice and green beans. The beans I think were cooked I the same spices and tasted awesome! The cilantro rice is also good. And don't forget the sauces. The hot sauce they had is so good, I can just grab a cup of that and dip my finger and go licking all day."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a really good, authentic Peruvian cuisine, skip this place and go somewhere else. I've given this place three chances, two different locations and each time I have been underwhelmed. Way too many red onions, food that is under seasoned unless you drench it in one of their sauces and I've found bones in every chicken item I've ordered. Not to mention the seating in each location has been terrible. I won't be going back. Pio Pio is much better."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here. Their chicken was delicious and seasoned perfectly. We ordered a whole chicken, which comes with 3 sides. The chicken was broken down into 4 pieces (2 white meat and 2 dark meat pieces), which was helpful. The meat fell right off the bone. You get 4 sauces with the chicken as well. There were only 3 in our bag, so unfortunately, I didn't get to sample all of them but their mild sauce was my favorite. Ordered the plantains, yuca and Peruvian corn salad for our sides. Their plantains and yuca (like a more fibrous French fry) were good, but nothing quite as memorable as their chicken. Their Peruvian corn salad had less corn and more fava beans and tomato. I wanted to give it a try, but probably wouldn't order it again. Their fried rice was ok - a little on the salty side. Loved their passion fruit juice. I would go back just for that."}
{"text":"Love this place and the new location on Park Rd!  Great chicken , plantains, green beans , rice etc!  I have never gotten anything that was not amazing! Fresh, delicious and between $8-12 a person !"}
{"text":"The food is really really good! Little on the expensive side but it's worth every penny. The staff can be rude and somewhat distant. They don't make you feel welcome and comfortable. Will go again later for sure just for the food. You got to try their fried rice dish (forgot the name)."}
{"text":"Prices are a little high for me *personally* to make it part of my weekly lunch rotation, but I think the quality substantiates it when you do go. I love all the sauces, and the plantain side is just the treat I need to finish the meal."}
{"text":"Nice lunch place and affordable. They don't have much variety but few healthy choices. Fried rice is good"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice now but both meals have been great! Tonight I ordered the quinoa stuffed avocados with chicken, taste and presentation were great. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Viva Chicken on 2/21. As many others have noted, the Quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken is wonderful. It's fresh, flavorful, well seasoned and substantial. My wife thoroughly enjoyed it. 

I had a quarter rotisserie chicken with canary beans and plantains. The chicken is moist, tender and very flavorful. (Get the half chicken if you're hungry, the leg/ thigh piece I had was a little on the small side.) The sauces that come with the chicken are very good also, the more spicy yellow sauce is worth the price to take home a bottle. The canary beans were cooked perfectly, tender, creamy and well seasoned. The fried plantains were great also, not greasy at all.  Fresh brewed iced tea was not too sweet. 

The staff was friendly and helpful. Can't wait too go back and try some other menu items. If we lived closer, this would be weekly visit."}
{"text":"This location was not as nice as the one at Huntersville. It was small, kinda messy and the floors looked dirty. The sauce station a mess. Our table was wabbling from side to side and we had to clean our own table. Had the stuffed avocado again but tasted different, sweet potato fries were very greasy. Will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"loved the food, the service and that they are enviromentaly conscience"}
{"text":"THE FRIES ARE AWESOME!!! I had \"the great\" chicken wrap and it was really nice also. The orange looking sauce they make is a must to go along with it! Personally i didn't like the cilantro lime rice or green beans, they didn't have much of a good flavor. The chicken is really good though."}
{"text":"We like the food the most of all things. Customer service perfectly fine. Sierra mist was a bit weird but who cares. Decor was very nice and food was brought out to the table within 5 minutes. 

They have outdoor seating and indoor seating. Definitely will come back and recommend."}
{"text":"Best food in Charlotte! Chill place, quick service, clean restaurant, and amazing food. If you are in a pinch, need lunch, or just want an easy dinner, stop by Viva Chicken! Not sure if I have a favorite, stuffed avocados are great, and be sure to try to spicy sauce!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Viva Chicken since I started traveling down here for work over a year ago and I only just now tried it today.  Why that is... I have no idea.  I feel like I've been missing out on life for so long.  I first attempted to order via Postmates, but the place was so busy that they cancelled my order and stopped taking new ones.  So... I hopped in an Uber and made the short drive over to the restaurant and picked up my phoned-in order.

The minute I walked into the restaurant I knew I'd made a good decision.  The place was insanely busy and it smelled amazing.  I was able to quickly pick up my order via the dedicated order pick up line.  Make sure you throw utensils inside because they didn't include any with my takeout order.

I ordered a 1/4 chicken combo (comes with 2 sides for under $9!) with a chicken soup and sweet potato fries.  The rotisserie chicken here is probably the best I've had anywhere, including a few Peruvian restaurants in NYC.  It was extremely flavorful and almost didn't need any sauce to go with it.  The chicken soup was also delicious, but for some reason all the veggies were almost raw - not sure if it's supposed to be like this.  The sweet potato fries are pretty standard and slightly soggy.. might taste better if you dined in.  

They have 3 sauces with different bases, but you can choose from mild, medium, and spicy.  I went with medium, which was a lime/cilantro flavor with a kick as well as the spicy, which was more creamy and pepper based.  I liked both, but neither are like the green sauce I've had at other Peruvian places.

I saw a lot of people get their fresh drinks... may have to try that next time too.

Overall, an excellent deal for delicious rotisserie chicken and sides.  The menu is pretty clean too and nothing too unhealthy (you can choose all white meat, too).  YUM!"}
{"text":"Always great food!  The chicken was delicious and the plan tunes were tremendously good."}
{"text":"(I'd give a 3.5 if possible.) One side of my family is Peruvian, so I'm very familiar with the cuisine. While Viva is not traditional Peruvian at all, they do have good food for a quick meal. My favorites are their Chicken Soup and fried yucca. There are 2 tweaks I'd suggest. At our last couple of visits,  the chicken -- while still wonderfully tender -- was really lacking the great seasonings that used to be used. Also, with shreds of chicken as large as are in this great soup, you really should provide soup spoons -- impossible to eat without dripping from a tiny spoon......."}
{"text":"The chicken was great, sauces tasted fresh, yucca and salad were good. Food, price and tea are better than at some competitors -- and Viva has a patio.  If you're looking for true traditional, this isn't necessarily the place.  But if you're looking to try Peruvian for the first time, it's a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Love the Peruvian chicken and plantains.  But especially love the yuca fries (with the green Peruvian aji sauce) and chicha morada (sweet purple corn and spices drink).  Lots of other things on the menu too. Fast and good food. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I honestly have endless positive things to say about this gem of a restaurant. It's a very convenient walk if you work or go to school at cpcc central campus. 


First off, I would just like to say the quality of their food is just perfection. I'm a very big fan of avocado and you can add avocado to any of your dishes for .75 cents. And perfectly ripen fresh cut avocados not the type of avocados that have been cut and mashed and left in the fridge for weeks. 

Rotisserie chicken is what they are known for and it's amazing. I personally love the stuffed quinoa avocado with shredded chicken. Very filling and healthy.  \"The Great\" sandwich is obviously great as well. Finish everything off with the maracuya drink and that's a perfect lunch for you."}
{"text":"Second time I've received completely burnt plantains while using postmates. Normally they're good is amazing in the restaurant but I won't be ordering new take out again."}
{"text":"This place is the best! I love Viva chicken. This chicken is seriously the most tasty in this city. Reminds me of Brazil. And the cilantro infused rice with green sauce is amazing. Don't forget the green sauce!"}
{"text":"Such a cozy find thanks to Yelp. My friends seemed to have enjoyed their meals. And this place seemed to be popular with the locals as well. I choose well! 

I think The Great (aka chicken sandwich) was pretty tasty. The chicken was fresh, but it could use more seasoning as it was more on the bland side. You have the option to make it a sandwich or wrap. Mine was the sandwich form with ciabatta as the bread. It overall had a great mixture of both meat and veggies. That thing was huge too.

There's also a side option with this entrée. I choose the yuka fries. It only came with 4 jumbo pieces. It was okay and nothing too wowing imo. The French fries my friends had was delish. It was coated with the right amount of salt, and the crispiness was just right as well. Okay. I'm partial to these fries. Lol. The sweet potato fries were okay imo. 

There was a sauce that accompanied these entrees that was delish and had a slight spicy kick, very slight. I wasn't sure if it was for the entrées or side items, but either was a sound choice. The maracuyu (passion fruit) drink was delish. It had just the right amount of sweetness. If each member of the group is going for this drink then purchase the half gallon option. I think it's cheaper this way as my friend choose this option after two of us had ordered individuals drinks already. Lol.

Parking was unique. There is a parking lot, but it's only accessible from one end of the restaurant. The other side has parallel parking. It's free on the weekends though as my friend visited here last Sunday."}
{"text":"The best rotisserie chicken. Ever. Seriously if you haven't tried this place yet, you must go now!!  The chicken is organic, free range and insanely delicious.  Start with a chicken meal so you can appreciate the chicken in all its glory. Recommend the cilantro rice on the side and give the plantains or yucca a try. The yellow sauce is good on almost everything!  Then venture out next time for the avocado appetizer (add chicken of course) or the fried rice. Yumeeeee."}
{"text":"Juicy, peruvian style chicken with a large variety of sides options. I had the 1/4 chicken with crispy green beans, chopped red peppers on top and a salad. They flavor tge ckicken under the skin so it tastes great all tge way through. They have amazing cookies called alphahores. They serve beer and wine and have a good lookung outdoor area..tent in winter. Colorful atmosphere with good music. Very clean. Sauce options at condiment station and hand wipes for cleaning up ur sticky fingers. About $10 for my meal. Worth it. They also have a whole chicken to take home for dinner."}
{"text":"The whole family loves this place! The sandwiches, salads, desserts, all fantastic. It's a nice option for healthier food that still tastes amazing. My sister loves the sauces they make here. It's very fast-casual and has a great outdoor patio. Prices are good too for the quality."}
{"text":"I had the 1/4 chicken meal with sweet plantains, a house salad and mint lemonade.  The service was quick and the food was delicious! The chicken was moist and juicy."}
{"text":"Why I haven't reviewed this place I'm not sure!  It is AH-MAZ-ING!  Love their food.  So fresh and tasty. I always get the 1/4 chicken with 2 sides..usually green beans and yuca or plantains. My husband usually gets the naked wrap (not sure if that's the exact name of it). He can never finish it so he always takes it home. 
Fast service and family friendly too. Lots of healthy options. Thanks Viva chicken for coming out to South Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Tried here for the first time the other day for lunch and I loved it! 
I got the Quinoa stuffed avocado and my husband got the 1/2 chiken with plantains and rice. My avocado dish was great & although it wasnt my husband's favorite, I like the chiken too. It was very flavorful! I will def be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Their food is okay and that's why I give 2 stars.. only because their food is okay. However, their customer service is sh*t. I ordered the classic saltado (sautéed steak, fries, onions, tomato, and white rice) and went all the way home to find out they gave me a box filled with juice and steak only. I don't know how they can mess up that bad, I had to drive all the way back (about 20 mins) to get my correct order and they had me wait about 15 minutes to give me my order and they just came out with rice and fries and not a brand new plate. When I asked for fresh steak too (because by now my steak is cold), the cashier took my old steak as she rolled her eyes and threw it away and told the cook to make new steak too and had to wait about 45 mins for that. That was enough for me to say I'm NEVER coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times and it is always delicious! I get \"the great\" sandwich. Yum! Fries are pretty awesome too. Make sure you use that dipping sauce they give you (it tastes pretty good on the sandwich too). Wish I lived closer or they had one in the Raleigh area!"}
{"text":"Delicious. So flavorful and the ingredients are very fresh. I had the 1/4 dark chicken with quinoa and canary beans. I also tried the quinoa stuffed avocado. The quinoa was tender and bright. The beans had a little spice. The stuffed avocado was tremendous. I loved the dressing/sauce on top. The chicken is phenomenal. A plus is that they use enviro-friendly disposable tableware. I will be back."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this Viva Chicken location because I want to give it the benefit of the doubt. Every time I come something is wrong. The last time I came the food was warm. I got a churro and it was so sugary when I bit it the sugar went all over me (even after I tried to pat it off). I decided to try it tonight because I was too hungry. My friends order came out wrong, 2 of the workers did not understand what we were saying to help us correct it. When we got the food again, it was still wrong. I am very disappointed. The Waverly location is much better."}
{"text":"Visited this place on my stopover in Charlotte, NC after many hours of driving. Fast food Peruvian and the food is great. Ordered take out though since I stayed at a hotel nearby. Portions are generous. Had the grilled chicken breast with Cilantro rice and beans. It was indeed delicious so are their native sauces which add a burst of flavor to the food. I do recommend this place if your looking for good, freshly made latin fast food."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. Chicken is cooked to perfection. Plantains are on point. And they have a good size menu. A must stop after a work out."}
{"text":"Having quinoa stuffed advacado.  It was really great!  Had a chance to sample the Sangria! Oh my it was so good.  The location required a little maneuvering to get to the parking.  The ambience both inside and outside was magnificent.  I cannot wait to return for an early evening \"pre-concert\" dinner and drinks!!"}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful, and I'm so glad they have a location so close to my house now! The quinoa stuffed avocado and the naked Peruvian wrap are the BEST."}
{"text":"This was the best chicken ever!! I will have to stop myself from coming here everyday. Were have you been all my life?  The staff is awesome. The restaurant was clean and welcoming. I think I have found my new go to restaurant. Five stars was not enough to give."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Charlotte and I am so happy that I could find Peruvian restaurants. I have to say that I was vey surprised with this one in particular. Everything is 5 stars at this place. From the service, the location and overall the food. It is a great place and the service is excellent something that I have never seen in any Peruvian restaurant in the US before. Excited that they are opening a Viva Chicken close to my place, I am sure that I will spend a lot of time and money there."}
{"text":"Fresh herbs, GREAT chicken, amazing juice (passion fruit and others), plantains...this place is the BOMB!!! I've found the best rotisserie chicken in the QC. It's everything. Juicy, the flavor is like \"WOW\". It's just perfect. You can tell a lot of love and care goes into the products here at Viva. they have a lunch special that's 1/4 chicken, fries, salad, and a drink for $5.95 (2-4pm). Can't beat that with a stick! Make sure you get your \"loyalty\" card when you go. Work your way up to a freebie ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to the huntersville location a few times but this new location rocked it. Friendly people and despite the lunch rush they got my order in and out quickly (quinoa stuffed avocado with pulled chicken, yummmyy) . Quality was good and just what I was expecting. First of many visits to this location. Have yet to visit on the weekend with mall traffic but if they keep up the service and quality how I had they'll do great."}
{"text":"Fresh food, clean, friendly staff, inexpensive, authentic Peruvian food.  Modern vibe on classic Peruvian fair.  A Must in the QC."}
{"text":"I love this place! Super good food with healthy options. A decent deal for the amount of food and quality - but not cheap. Expect to pay a bit but you will be astounded by the amount of food you end up getting. And how good it is!"}
{"text":"It isn't fancy, but it sure is good! The restaurant is simple and seat-yourself. There is a patio that looks out to a parking lot, but you wouldn't notice because the sides are surrounded by clever planters suspended in front of the non view. It the temperatures are pleasant, outside is where you want to be.
Now the food. Yum! Marinated Peruvian style chicken is the highlight of the menu. Your choice of whole , half or quarter chicken & sides. I got a quarter chicken because I wanted the appetizer too. The appetizer I chose was a composition of chicken salad covered with yumminess & garnishes. I think brides should have it instead of wedding cake. Lovely to look at & livelier to eat.
The sides that we had were infuses rice, beans green beans (get this! So good!), & plantain chips.
The beverages are worth a trip in themselves. 3 house specifies plus sangria, fountain drinks & beer.
I only regret I didn't have room for dessert. They looked delicious.
You should eat here and try everything."}
{"text":"Food was good, setup and atmosphere was clean and polite, servers were friendly and appropriately attentive, and no tips were asked!!! I don't know what can top that when you dine out. It reminds me of (ahem) any restaurant outside of the States where they don't expect you to tip. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Some friends of ours love Viva Chicken & took us here for dinner. I'm a huge fan of Hispanic cuisine, but I've never eaten Peruvian before, so I was eager to give it a try, and I was not disappointed. We had chicken with sides and it was all excellent. Chicken was perfectly cooked & the yuca sticks were delicious. The hot sauces weren't really very hot, but they were tasty & plentiful. Service was ok, & in spite of it being extremely busy, the staff got us a nice table in sunroom/patio area all to ourselves. All in all we had a great meal with great friends. I highly recommend Viva Chicken if you want a good meal without breaking the bank. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with good value.  Use their pick-up / take out service a lot and pre-orders are usually accurate (95%). Tremendous salads (all of them) and like the wraps.  Would like to see more grain & wheat free options on the wraps."}
{"text":"Love the different options and flavors this place offers. Parking at the Elizabeth location can be challenging but not impossible. Plan ahead. Great lunch or dinner place. I recommend the fried rice which will give you two meals! Sauces can be spicy so dabble lightly at first. For lighter options any of the salads will leave you full but not guilt ridden. The stuffed avocado is also a great lighter option. Usually crowded during lunch but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love Viva Chicken! I typically only eat there when I'm in Huntersville, but now that one's closer, I'll be going more often. 

The Great is delicious, and the sweet potato fries are pretty good too. Just wish the fries were a little crisper, but that's hard with sweet potato fries. 

Really wanted to try the yuca, but they don't currently have it due to a shortage of yuca crop. Will definitely have to try it next time I'm there. 

The staff was super friendly and attentive, which is good because it's brand new and super crowded right now. They will also give you samples of the juices they have, which are amazing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Seriously...I can eat here twice a day for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Viva Chicken to me so I went.  I got the classic saltado and it was good - good portion size and plenty of steak in my dish.  At the register, you can order your food for take-out or eat-in and take a number with you to where you would like to sit and then they will bring you your food when it is ready.  Napkins, sauces (all were very good), silverware, and fountain drinks were self serve.  I will be back again to try the arroz chaufa and tres leche cake."}
{"text":"Go get the quinoa stuffed avocado immediately! Add the chicken, get some of the mild sauce and you will be happy. Trust. :-)"}
{"text":"The smell in the vicinity of this place forced me to go inside for a taste.  Only disappointment was I didn't get the 1/2 chicken. Everything was seasoned well the chicken and sauce is awesome. And the green beans were very tasty."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Peruvian cuisine and this was my first time trying it in Charlotte. I decided not to play it safe with the traditional meal with fries and rice. Instead I ordered Quinoa as well as green beans to pair with my chicken. The entire meal was full of so much flavor and the sauces were just an added bonus."}
{"text":"I am so glad we tried this place-- we're from out of town and were looking for a reasonable place good for kids.  Bingo on both counts.  The best part though?  The food was delicious.  My husband and I both had the 1/4 rotisserie chicken.  We asked for white meat, and it was so tender and moist, it tasted like dark. Our meals came with two sides (the kids' meals did as well).  I got sweet potato fries and the cilantro-infused rice-- both were excellent.  I have to say the different sauces were a close second to the chicken itself. You order at the counter, and they deliver--paper plates and plastic silverware, but it definitely felt like a sit down place because the service was friendly and attentive. We sat in the lovely, closed-in, heated garden patio. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for some good chicken this is a good place, they are quick and food is great, suggestions: Fried Yucca, Inca wrap and of course the CHICKEN!!! All is good and you have to try ALL the sauces. Give a try."}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! My job is 1.6 miles from VIVA Chicken and  I've never seen or heard of this place until now. My  friend (he's a die hard fan of this place) suggested eating dinner here. Boy O boy....the food was delicious!!! I will definitely be back!!! Especially...on my lunch breaks. =10 star's"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great quality for a great price. Get the whole chicken and share it with the whole family. Personally I love the Peruvian salad, it is a corn and bean salad with onions, peppers, and cilantro. Delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I cant wait to go back. they have this yellow sauce that is amazing. The staff was great and there are a lot of different option on the menu! They have vegetarian friendly options which was surprising given the name."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian food spot around Charlotte, great food, causal ambiance, great service."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, I've never had anything bad here. The sauces are incredible. One of the best casual places in charlotte"}
{"text":"AWFUL experience at this location!! Half of my party waited 30 minutes for their food. So one half had to sit and watch the other half eat. Then the minute we got done my table was TOLD to leave the  restaurant because people were waiting. We were NOT asked to leave. Never in my life have I been told to leave a restaurant to make room for other people. No one else was asked to leave but my table. Awful customer service and totally disrespectful. I've contacted corporate and I will he following up."}
{"text":"Great casual Peruvian place. Had the grilled chicken with beens and rice. Make sure you get the green sauce. The chicken was cooked to perfection. Just spicy enough green sauce and great rice. Will definitely come back again. Looking forward to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken may be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte right now. The ingredients are so perfectly paired with one another and the atmosphere is light and modern. I've had two different things and the one I vouch for is the chicken taco bowel with avocado and a side of the spicy green sauce. Wow! I'm in love! It's a layer of rice, beans, moist chicken, and cilantro onions and tomatoes and I usually add avocado too. I think it's about $11 after you add chicken and avocado which for lunch I think is a great deal. 

I also got the quinoa stuffed avocados and they were delicious but I didn't like all the spicy mayo on top. I'm not a mayo fan though so that's probably why. 

The owner is a sweetie always helping and inquiring after his customers and the staff is receptive, timely, and helpful.

I also love all the plates and silverware can be recycled."}
{"text":"We went today just after 11:00. Ordered the chaufa. Sorry to say the rice tasted like stale leftovers from yesterday. Chicken was not shredded, as advertised . . Just pulled off in strips. And the whole dish was barely warm. Staff was friendly and nice. Sweet potato fries were excellent. Disappointed that they would serve lukewarm leftovers, especially after all the good reviews."}
{"text":"Occasionally I travel for work and you can be sure when I'm back in Charlotte I will again hit this spot.  The food is absolutely delicious.  We ate here for lunch and had the chicken, rice, and avocado.  It was the best rice and chicken I've ever had and I frequent five star restaurants!   The seasoning and marinade on the chicken are superb as are the flavors in the rice.  I will pay for that rice recipe!   :)

Again, delicious food and please open a restaurant in California!"}
{"text":"At least 1 employee is always sick in that restaurant, At least try to keep it clean by not running my food or taking my order... It's very unsanitary, either tell them to go home or don't bring them in"}
{"text":"I will never stop singing your praises, Viva Chicken!!!  I am very sorry for not having reviewed this wonderful place (specifically the Elizabeth location) before now, but today's efforts were Herculean.  No contest, you are my favorite go-to for catering ever.

Let me set the scene... It's 11:15am today, my director of HR comes over and says, \"Oh hai!  I totally forgot but we want lunch today for a meeting of 30 people, and we kinda don't want pizza.\"  ... Me: *blink, blink* *deep breath in, deep breath out* *send panic stricken email to Emily Ortiz (catering director at Elizabeth Viva Chicken) begging for immediate defcon 1 help.*  

Knowing poor Emily is probably out delivering lunch to a ton of places who actually gave her 24 hours notice (ie: not me today), I call.  It's now 11:26am, and I get General Manager, Anthony Hartsell on the line.  He puts me on a SUPER brief hold just to ensure his kitchen can handle the excess order during (read: DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF) the lunch rush... then he comes back and says YES!!!

I get to Viva Chicken at 11:45.  I am pulling away with ALL promised food as well as all cutlery, serving-ware, plates, napkins, sauces, and a generally awesome package of necessary accoutrements and then some at 11:56pm.

I make it to my office, get it set up, and get lunch served by 12:15pm.  

Dear Emily, Anthony, and your ENTIRE crew of rock stars over there, I love you.  I will forever be grateful to you for today, and you will NEVER lose my business! 

To wit: May Viva Chicken forever be showered by blessings from the gods of catering!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. Always get take out so can't comment on anything else but it's aways packed with people when I pick up my food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Food is delicious!  I have been here numerous times and I've never had a bad experience. The customer service is great. The only thing I have noticed is the soup is inconsistent, but even when it is not its best it is still really good."}
{"text":"We picked this place randomly from what we saw on Yelp and I'm glad we did. Viva Chicken is a Peruvian Rotisserie joint specializing in Pollo a la Brasa.

For lunch I ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken and picked french fries and plantains for my sides. The chicken was absolutely delicious and so were the plantains. The fries were not your average fries and when you combine them with the house sauces, it's a winning combination. I also had their herbal limeade which was lime, basil, rosemary, and mint. 

For dessert I ordered their Tres Leches which is a white sponge cake soaked in three milks. Great portion size and amazing taste. 

If I'm in the area, I will certainly be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best \"fast casual\" restaurant in Charlotte. Their chicken is cooked very well, and the flavor and sauces are excellent - comparable in quality to the gourmet restaurants I tried when in Peru. All of their entrees are also very good. Their salads are also my favorite in the city - even their vegetarian options are probably the best you can find around the CLT. 

You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience here! The food was awesome... I had the 1/4 chicken with the 2 sides, Yukon potatoes and the plantains. Both sides were delicious and the chicken was moist and flavorful. I also had to try the avocado appetizer so I got a half order of it and it  was the best part of my meal! 

The service was also incredible. I'm assuming this place is more of a fast food place but the service I received was not fast food like at all... I had two employees come and check on me and made sure I was happy with my meal and one of them filled up my water cup twice! I felt bad having him do that but he insisted! Even the customers were great.. Everyone was recommending food to me left and right! I highly recommend this place and next time I'm in charlotte I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Foods always fresh. I enjoy the chicken especially. Never actually sat down inside, but have gotten take out many, many times. A great go-to."}
{"text":"First a little deterred by the lack of table seating and service. But quickly disproven after we ordered at the counter and was a joyride experience to the end. What a monumental, model-breaking restaurant. 

SUPER friendly service, both the manager and several ppl came to check on us, despite again, not having to \"tip\" or feeling like it was owed. 

90% of the ppl eating here are not white. I love that its deceptively cheap, family-friendly, yet the quality is super high. Food came almost instantly. Really authentic, juicy Peruvian rotisserie roast chicken, with my favorite sides -- super fluffy crispy yuca fries, delicious caramelised plaintains, an enormous salad with feta and honey dressing. I still can´t believe my family ate for under 50 bucks AND we had booze (housemade sangria with lots of fresh fruit, and nice selection of beer).

Homemade churros sealed the deal. 

Not to mention the help-yourself sauces, with the green spicy Peruvian mint one being my favorite."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tacu Bowl and it was covered in onions and no tomatoes! What happened to the tomatoes? I've ordered a few times and they keep dumping it with onions. 
The sauce is great and definitely tops it off but tomatoes would have been preferred...
Also the food tends to be too salty. 
Their andina quinoa salad is on point though and always delicious! I just wish Viva was more consistent."}
{"text":"I used their catering service at this location and was extremely happy with the service.

The food was everything you could expect if you've dined in before. The catering staff was prompt and helpful.

I will definitely be using them again for catering in the future!"}
{"text":"I have just recently discovered Viva Chicken and I have to tell you that I am crazy in love with their sopa de pollo. I could eat it every single day!

We are visiting this location within days of their grand opening and so far the restaurant is very clean and the wait staff exceedingly friendly. As it is with all of their restaurants, the staff is happy to explain the dishes to you and make recommendations. My partner had the quarter chicken with the two sides. He chose the Peruvian corn salad and plantains. The chicken was well-cooked moist and delicious. The skin has a little bit of spice on it which provides a nice kick. I had the chicken soup, which is a large portion of shredded chicken with a variety of fresh vegetables on top of it including onions, red peppers, green onions, carrots and peas. I add a little bit of their green chili sauce to add a bit of a kick and the soup is fantastic. We also ordered the herbal limeade and the mango drink. Both were fresh and delicious and are served without ice, like in Peru, so you get a full glass of drink. I like both of them equally.

We ended the meal with the Dulce de leche cake, and while I wasn't a big fan of the whipped cream icing at first, after a few bites I decided that it was the perfect topping to a very delicious version of this cake. I will definitely be having it again.

The only downside I can speak to is that they don't have baffles on the ceiling and so it is very loud in the restaurant. If you're wanting to have a quiet conversation, you won't be having it inside. Fortunately they provide a few covered tables outside and despite a lot of traffic going by I suspect it is quieter than inside the restaurant.

Having said that, I would highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Viva Chicken and i was really impressed! The restaurant was very clean and its evident as soon as you enter that you are gonna have a great, fresh meal.  The staff is also very pleasant and helpful as you navigate the menu.

I ordered the Sopa de Pollo (chicken soup) and it was fantastic! It comes topped with an amazing assortment of fresh veggies and is very filling.  No noodles,  just a lot of chicken with rice.  I also had the Yucca Fries side. Comes with 8 fries and a delicious dipping sauce.  Definitely a delight.  Crisp and light and a perfect side dish.  I would also suggest getting the Herbal Limeade.   It's different from other limeades but oh so delicious.  The mint flavore comes through and is so thirst quenching! 

I'll definitely be returning to try and review additional items!"}
{"text":"I was hungry after a long flight from Australia.  Didn't want to cook but look for something different.  Yelp to find this place.  As I walked into the shop, I realized I was there once long time ago.
I didn't know what to order, a Russian employee explained to us in detail.  Finally a whole chicken with 3 sides for 2 persons. Yum!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I heard so many good things about Viva Chicken. We decide to give it a shot. We walked in they were busy lots of seats taken families all over the place. I like the fact that you order your food up front and go and sit and wait for it to be delivered. 

My wife ordered a chicken bowl which according to her was amazing and too much food but she had leftovers for the next day (Bonus!!) She also got the plantain fries which she loved. I ordered the Quarter chicken and two sides now I wasn't a big fan of the sides but I am a picky eater. Now the Chicken was amazing cooked perfectly had a seasoning on it that was absolutely the best thing on a chicken. AMAZING!!

Staff was friendly the price was decent and the place was clean all good for me!

Try the place out it is some of the best chicken you will have in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves the best chicken anywhere, hands down. The flavors are unbelievably good and have tons of depth. The chicken is always tender and moist, never dry.

The sides are great - make sure to try the organic canary beans and the peruvian corn salad."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant. The chicken is out of this world good. Spiced to perfection and slow roasted on the rotisserie. The corn salad is quite tasty and refreshing, and the bean soup was also very good. 

I wasn't a huge fan of the plantains (too much sugary glaze), but my wife loved them. Overall, this is great food at a good price."}
{"text":"Meh.

A 1/4 chicken here is little more that a drumstick and thigh. Flavorful enough, but oily and with gelatinous skin.  A side of plantains is two pieces, the soup was better.  Wrestle your way into the corner for utensils and napkins, drinks and sauce. Wrestle your way out of the corner past those wrestling their way in.  $16 didn't add up here, at least not for me."}
{"text":"Excellent! Every time I'm in Charlotte this us the lunch spot. Love love their herbal lemonade. Asian Salad with chicken is delicious.  Great service, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place it's good for fast 
Meal and good option 

For me it's not tasty 
I like the green beans 
The chicken not tasty 
Price it's not cheap"}
{"text":"Man! This place is BUSY! I'm adding another star for excellent customer service. I came in on friday at about 12:30. Woah! All of the tables were full and the line was about 15 ppl deep. The line moves fairly quickly. I ordered my rotisserie chicken, side salad, and plantains to go. There were so many people waiting for their take-out, but no one seemed to mind. An employee began passing out free herbal tea lemonade to those of us waiting and apologized for the wait. It was green tea-y and delicious! I had to wait about 10 minutes, but i didn't mind. The food is well worth the wait and the extra attention to detail and lemonade was an added bonus! I'll be back soon, viva chicken!!"}
{"text":"After a movie date to see Darkest Hour which is one of the best movies I have seen in recent memory, my wife and I enjoyed lunch at the new Viva Chicken Peruvian Rotisserie Joint. The ordering line was divided into two separate lines: one for on-line pickups and the other for takeout / dining in. We were given a marker with a number to put on our table, and a server brought the meals to us. Service was reasonably quick. There were numerous families with children. 
Linda had the tacu bowl with cilantro rice and pulled chicken. I enjoyed the arroz chaufa with pulled chicken. We each had an Incan cola. The food and sauces were delicious, and we plan to return."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Chicken was so flavorful. Highly recommend the avocado quinoa. Just discovered this place but we will be back. Loved the variety of healthier options."}
{"text":"Always a favorite for the whole family.  While we have had many dishes the arroz chaufa with chicken is my standby.  It is always amazing.  The service is friendly and food is ready quickly.  The real secret is the green sauce.  Now that they have it self serve by the drinks it is much easier!  We go through a lot of it.  The side dishes are really good.  The beans are my favorite.  We normally buy one kids pulled chicken meal and split it between our two kids.  It is a ton of food.  The arroz chaufa is big enough it usually makes two or three meals."}
{"text":"After parking our car back by Pike Nurseries and riding our bikes on the McAlpine Creek Greenway, I noticed Viva Chicken in the same parking lot.  I had heard good things about the one in Elizabeth, so we decided to grab an early dinner to replenish our energy.  

Knowing it was our first time (and there wasn't a line behind us), the super-friendly and knowledgeable cashier walked us through the menu and gave us tiny samples of their three homemade juices.  Since the rotisserie chicken is their most popular dish, I knew I had to try that.  I also spent the 75 cents more to get all white meat.  1/4 chicken was more than enough for me (although some hungry eaters can get 1/2 chicken).  You get two sides with your chicken meal, so I immediately gravitated toward the yucca fries because of their uniqueness and then chicken and rice soup.  I had the most difficult time deciding between the three juice drinks, though.  All of them were amazing.  I eventually went with the lemonade infused with basil, rosemary, and mint.  I think I could have drank a gallon of it; that's how deliciously refreshing (and also unique!) it was.  

After ordering at the counter and picking a seat in the very clean, modern dining room, our meals were brought out to us.  The chicken was amazing.  I don't normally like chicken served on the bone, but I'll make an exception for Viva Chicken's  Peruvian Rotisserie Chicken (Pollo a la Brasa) any day.  It was so flavorful and moist.  To make it even better, we're given two dipping sauces -- a yellow Aji Amarillo sauce and a green Huacatay sauce, both of which I had never heard of or tried before.  Both tasted amazing and offered a little heat.  They were perfect for the chicken and the yucca fries (which were delicious as well).  The soup was good, too, but I could have stood another helping of yucca fries in its place.  (I tried to duplicate them at home, but no no no...)  

Anyway, I can't recommend Viva Chicken enough.  It's our favorite new \"fast food\" place for a delicious healthful meal, awesome drinks, friendly staff, modern atmosphere, and a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Viva is pretty good, but it's definitely on the more expensive side for quick food. It tastes good, but it all kind of tastes the same. One thing I absolutely love from there is the basil limeade. It's very unique and really refreshing. I stop here for lunch occasionally, but it's not somewhere you go if you're on a really strict lunch budget."}
{"text":"Typical chicken joint. Taste is ok. Bit on the expensive side. Crowded always. I guess they are doing something right."}
{"text":"Perfect \"not cheat meal\"! We cook up to 8 times a day for our lifestyles and it is so nice to have someone else do it for us without cheating on our diets! Viva Chicken is delicious, affordable and very close to home! This location is even better than the one in Lake Norman!"}
{"text":"My mouth waters just thinking about the meal I had here! I had the Classic Saltado... The steak was extremely juicy and tender. The fries were crisp and really complimented the meat and vegetable medley on top. Oh and the au jus... I think Jesus came and made it himself! I even asked for extra which the GM had them whip me up some since everything is made to order! Also the dining room attendant Dennis really was great too! Very attentive and extremely helpful. I will continue to visit this location!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. It was one of the best dining experiences in a long time. It is eco-friendly, Peruvian-style rotisserie chicken - and so much more. Get the chicken, get the sides, get the juices, and definitely get the desserts. The service is excellent, the food is fresh, tasty, and wonderfully spiced. All reasonably priced. Just great."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food is the arroz chaufa with chicken! I also ordered the Viva Chicken salad today with chicken, avocado, feta, tomatoes,
Romaine lettuce and a little kale. The house dressing is balsamic and it's a generous portion.
Arroz chaufa is fries rice with chicken and a bit of spicy seasoning. I love the ajillo garlic sauce for flavor and delicious taste!!"}
{"text":"How do you throw customers out a few minutes before closing?! We arrived at this location 5 minutes before closing and an employee approached and said they were closed and only doing take out orders!! Really?!! If the kitchen is still open, would it be so bad to just take our order!! what kind of manager allows paying customers to just walk away like that! With this kind of service I will never  step into a Viva Chicken again and give them my money!"}
{"text":"Everything positive you read about this place is not enough to describe how good the food actually is! Haven't tried anything that I wouldn't eat again...go blindly and pick anything on the menu it will be amazing !!"}
{"text":"Oh my!  The first time we tried to visit this place, we were turned off by the long line of people waiting to order and the loud music. We wanted to eat, not dance!   Lol. We tried again, after a friend told us how great the food was.   We were not disappointed!   The chicken was delicious, the side orders too and portions were generous.  We enjoyed the \"yucas\" (fried cassava).  Never had them so soft before; the Canary beans are somewhat  different (they were a little spicy),  the maduros were overdone but sweet.  

The best part is the self-served bar with 3 different sauces. The green one (a mix of coriander, black mint and lemon with a kick), the traditional yellow sauce a tad spicier (made with yellow hot peppers, we detected cummin too) and the  hottest, a pink sauce, the hottest of the three (made from red hot peppers).

For desser we tried the \"alfajores\"; they were the best we've ever had.  Ethereal; not cheap,  they call them shortbread  cookies, highly recommend.  The best deal was the whole chicken with 3 sides  (upgrade for a few  dollars if you want all-white chicken); it is a good deal.   

We like Inca Kola, a peruvian soda,  but it is an acquired taste.  Some say it tastes like bubble gum! 

 Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to boring lunch options.  Great food and amazing sauces. I get the Great Wrap and sweet potato fries. The rotisserie chicken meal is awesome too.  They don't have great nutrition info on their website or in the store so calorie information is simply a guess here.  

Services isn't speedy. They give you a number and bring it to your table. I'd say it rivals Panera's speedy level. 

Place is always clean and well stocked."}
{"text":"Their cilantro rice is cooked with a prefect balance of cilantro. It's fragrant and delicious.  Their rice makes it stand out than any other Peruvian restaurant in town. I also like the quinoa stuffed avocado. One can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches too. All of them are great! The herbal lemonade and maracuya drinks are refreshing and it's always nice to finish your meal with the Churros and/or alfajores!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Crazy good flavor.  Good service, even with a long line. Prices are a bit high, but it was really good and good portions."}
{"text":"I really like the service and the food at this place.  We had a about 8 people and the employees were able to put together tables on the patio for us as soon as we walked in.  When I was getting sauce another employee came up to me to explain about the sauces; since this was the first time that i had been, it was extremely helpful to me.  The food was really good too.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday and since my wife is a vegetarian she order a serving of, Sweet Potato Fries, Sweet Plantains, (not a big selection for Vegetarians) and I ordered the Inca Wrap, Green Beans, Fried Yucca.  The food was good,  my Inca Wrap was between room temperature and hot..... I was looking for something more Peruvian and less American still Peruvian food."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken & sauces!!! The green sauce is like crack. Seriously. The dish similar to fried rice was okay to me but anything doused in their sauce is going to be delish. Their quinoa is the best I've ever had. I crave this place!"}
{"text":"Love the chafua (fried rice) with chicken!! It is the best entree and super delicious. I also tried the stuffed avocado with quinoa. The avocado was tasty but served cold, which was odd. I think the portions are generous & very yummy."}
{"text":"Love love love the plantains!! The chicken is always seasoned well! My favorite Peruvian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very clean, professional staff, and great food!!!! I only went there for the first time a couple months ago, but I will definetly be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken has become our favorite new place to go for a quick, delicious meal.  Our first visit, we went to the one in Ballantyne; on our second, the one in Elizabeth.  I'm usually not one to like a meal with chicken on the bone, but in this case, I'll make an exception.  Whatever Viva Chicken does to their rotisserie chicken works.   It tastes so delicious on its own (I get the all-white version), but when you add their unique yellow Aji Amarillo and green Huacatay dipping sauces to it, it's out of this world!  I also can't get enough of their yucca fries as a side (I wish they served more!).   As my second side, I've tried the chicken and rice soup and the canary beans.  The soup was good, but I think the canary beans were better.  I'm not a big fan of green beans, but I've heard that theirs are pretty amazing, so I'll have to try those next time as my 2nd side (I'll never not get yucca fries as my 1st side).  

Also, all three of their juice drinks are amazing.  Skip the soda and water, and order one of these -- you won't be sorry.  Tip: Ask for a tiny sample of each and see which one you like best!  So far, mine has been the lemonade infused with basil, rosemary, and mint, but the other two are delicious as well.  

The Elizabeth location has indoor dining and a BIG outdoor seating area, too."}
{"text":"The plantains are perfectly done as well as the yucca. The staff is friendly and the menu gives plenty to choose from. The food is fresh and well seasoned. A good place to grab a quick bite to eat.  By the way the parking across the street in the lot is convenient. Not sure what it's like during the weekday but after work and weekends I have no problems."}
{"text":"Traveling through, picked up 5 dinners to go.  Everyone was happy, happy, happy.  The choices are great, the soup was so nice as a side option without increased cost.  LOVE"}
{"text":"Slow. What is the joint of the promised ready time when its 15-30 minutes off? Online ordering is pointless"}
{"text":"Too good to be fast food! The chicken was so juicy and flavorful, the chick soup was good, the plantain was perfect. Very good quality of food"}
{"text":"This chicken is delicious I mean you can seriously just eat the chicken by itself especially if you have their famous dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh! Top notch customer service! The avocado side is so good. Service is fast. Nice to have healthy options."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER!!!!!!!!! LIKE EVERRRRR!!!! Customer service is decent but the food is phenomenal. Excellent selections and great atmosphere.  Yummmm"}
{"text":"Wow
Great experience from start to finish.
Place order as you walk in, get your number, fill up your beverage and head to your table. Cozy atmosphere. Very friendly staff stops by after food is served to check on you.
Inca wrap with chicken and green beans side so filling and great!
1/2 chicken moist and tasty. Canary beans some kuc
Beer and sangria available.
Fernando was right...best tres leches in town!
Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is always quick and delicious. You won't be disappointed! The sweet potato fries are my favorite, and the sauces are delightful.

The only downside is that it's pricey for a mid-level restaurant that serves like a burrito joint. If there was one closer to my beating path I would eat there more if the price was a little lower."}
{"text":"Been eating here from day 1. I usually get the Great and fries. It's so dang good and the fried yucca is good too. I tried the sautéed green beans for the first time last weekend. OMG!!! very very good!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's always so so clean and everyone is always so nice and helpful. 
Have never had a bad experience. Come to this one all the time, not just because I live down the street."}
{"text":"I normally try to take pics but I started eating and forgot too . We were just passing through the city and became stuck in traffic. Not unusual for the Charlotte area though. Anyway found this place off of the highway and decided to try something different. The chicken was excellent. (Hormone free) There were four of us so we ordered the family meal which is a whole chicken cut in quarters and three sides. We ordered rice, salad and fries. It was fresh and other than the fries, something I felt good about feeding my family. Very reasonably priced to. I think the family meal was $23 plus drinks. Would definitely recommend and return again."}
{"text":"I was a fan after the first time, but after sending several emails to corporate requesting nutritional information, I still haven't gotten a response and therefore am losing interest in this place.  I can't seem to find anything online, and for those on dietary restrictions, that can be very frustrating.  Viva should have more respect for their customers.  In addition, the take out doesn't seem to be nearly as good as eating it there.  The portions seem much smaller (sides) and the rice tends to be pretty dry."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. To describe this food as delicious would be an understatement. Viva was highly recommended by all of my coworkers. Before this visit, I tried to eat at this place twice and struck out miserably. I was determined to try this place ASAP! 

I'm that person who looks at the restaurant menu beforehand so I have an idea of what to order. I thought I was ready but I wasn't...I wanted to order everything! I settled on the arroz chaufa with chicken. Yummmm! The serving was enough for leftovers the next day. I added cilantro on top of my rice to add a little extra kick :). My only complaint is the scarce amount of chicken sprinkled throughout the rice. I ordered sweet plantains on the side; these were perfect! To drink, I chose the herbal lemonade, a heavenly mixture of fresh herbs and lemonade chilled and sweetened to perfection! The overall experience was great. The staff were very friendly and patient. I have a feeling that Viva will definitely become one of my go to restaurants!"}
{"text":"I can't begin to count the compliments I am still getting from having Viva Chicken cater my 4th (well -3rd) of July Party.  Being a big fan of the food already and having them save me from the kitchen when having guests over before - I decided to just let them do all the work and cater a much larger group.  My guests are still calling me to talk about how great that food was. Chelsea (the Catering Manager) was an absolute delight to work with.  She was so gracious, flexible and attentive.  She actually made the delivery and set up herself and was on time and had everything I ordered perfectly.  I have been in the F&B business for over 30 years - and I can say she is one of the best I have worked with!!  I would hire her in a minute.  Wondering what to order? I would say - order  more chicken than you expect you will need and for sure more quinoa avocados than you think your group would possibly eat.  Trust me - you will not have any leftovers!"}
{"text":"Really good food, always fresh and tasty. The 1/4 chicken combo is what I usually get.
Try the sauces!!! Love love them, specially the yellow. Also the Sangria mix drink is really good too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is so fresh and delicious. The solterito is spicy fresh so good. You have to get the herbal limeade, infused with basil, Rosemary and mint. They may have to throw us out before we drink it all."}
{"text":"I searched Yelp for Peruvian food while I was in Charlotte last month and I was sooooo happy with what I found!! The location is wonderful, you can see the skyline from the restaurant, you can go for a walk and just really enjoy the area. But anywho, the food was to die for! I have been back a few times since. We usually order the whole chicken with 3 sides and change the sides up every time. We've now tried the whole menu and haven't been disappointed once. And let's not even get started on the drinks they make! The chicha morada and the basil lemonade are my favorites! And the staff is ridiculously friendly and kind. They even have this beautiful little outdoor eating area surrounded by flowers! It's just so nice."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual dinner with the family. Chicken offerings are great, love the sauces, love the friendly service. Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome the bowls are delicious and I would recommend it to anyone, cool atmosphere with outdoor seating. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Viva Chicken. We had been patrons of the the location in Elizabeth and were so happy when they opened one in Ballantyne. The food is delicious especially the sauces, yucca fries and plantains. We typically eat here at least twice a month. We love taking new people to try it. The prices are great and the service is always friendly and fast. The only very very minor thing we aren't crazy about is the strange club type music that they play over the speakers."}
{"text":"So good! Healthy, quick casual restaurant that serves up some non-traditional ingredients. I had a salad with pulled chicken. It was amazingly flavorful. I also ordered a side of plantains and they were delish- caramelized and so sweet. My son had the kids chalufa and remarked numerous times that he wishes we had one in our home town. 

Only negative feedback is the lack of bathrooms- one stall for a big restaurant seems a bit skimpy. The staff and the food however were top notch!"}
{"text":"After you come to Viva Chicken once, it will consistently be your go-to place for a quick and delicious meal.

You really can't go wrong with any of the dishes, but if you are unsure I would recommend the classic chicken with a few sides.  The cilantro infused rice and plantains are my favorite sides out of the bunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat. Prices are good.  I can't find anything to say about improvements. ..friendly service and great customer service.  I might be back until next year because I am from L.A.  but please open a Viva Chicken in So.Cal."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to grab a bite to eat!  As a family we tend to order whole chicken meals with salad,  yuca (which have gotten disappointingly skinnier) and plantains. Have ordered several other menu items without disappointment. I do wish they had advertised veggie plate (is available, just have to ask) or vegetarian kids options. Great flavors and consistently good!"}
{"text":"Just as good as I remember....I seriously love this place. And I'm so glad that there's one closer to my side of town! 

One of the best things about this location is the service! Everyone was so kind and attentive!! They offered great suggestions and refilled our drinks, checked on us to make sure that we enjoyed what we ordered and thanked us for coming in! Simply awesome! 

I tried something different today and was very impressed with my order. I started with the half order chicken stuffed avocado. That thing is a pure piece of heaven. It's half an avocado topped with quinoa, shredded chicken and balsamic dressing....yummy! Like every bite was better than the last....and the previous reviews are correct this could totally be a meal! I'd definitely recommend ordering it! 

I also ordered \"The Great\" sandwich with Yuca fries. The sandwich is chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, onions a spicy mayo on a ciabatta roll. Another excellent choice....the chicken is soooo good! And they are not skimpy with the amount! That sandwich could really feel two people! Oh and let's not forget those rolls.....delish!!! The fries were a nice addition but I look forward to trying some other sides next time! 

Whatever you decide on will be worth every delicious bite! I'm already ready to go back...."}
{"text":"I was picking up lunch on Elizabeth one day and accidentally spotted this place.  After reading all of the reviews I definitely had very high expectations (sometimes not a good thing).  However, this place did not disappoint at all.  I got the rotisserie chicken, plantains, and yucca.  The chicken literally falls off of the bone and is extremely tender and juicy.  It is also packed full of authentic flavor (I say that having been down there).  The plantains were amazing.  I could have had only those for my entire meal.  The yucca is rather bland, but that is how it is supposed to taste so it is cooked how it should be!  We also got the \"Famous Huancaina\" appetizer which is basically grilled potatoes with cheese sauce over the top.  Very nice appetizer to share.  The staff are all courteous, friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt.  The atmosphere is inviting as well, especially the patio covered with flowers.  

There were a couple of aspects of the experience that could have been improved upon.  The chicken portions are rather small, so if you are hungry get the half chicken not the quarter (I know, I know, the portion sizes are probably sufficient but this is 'Merica and we like our food portions huge).  The appetizer came out actually after our food came out, so that was a bit of a problem.  There were several of us there and we had nothing to do later so we wanted to more or less relax and not rush to eat.  If you want to sit and share a drink or two before dinner, do not order when you get your drinks, as the food comes out rather quickly (*note: This is not necessarily a bad thing if you are in a hurry, just something to keep in mind).  We sat at the corner table on the patio, directly under the speaker, and it was very loud.  Overall this is one of, if not my absolute, favorite chicken places that I have found in Charlotte.  Definitely recommend this to anyone. 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is the answer to the prayer you didn't even know you had. It provides high quality, inexpensive, healthy food muy rapido!  The casual restaurant has counter service and a sleek, modern interior with a large side covered patio with super cute planters in painted gutters (which is an odd thing to mention in a review, but it really does add to the airy ambiance).  This place had some formidable predecessors - anyone remember the institution that was Anderson's with their great down home $3 eggs or the Starbucks where there was never a line?  But Viva Chicken fills the void and more.

The menu offers Peruvian features with rotisserie chicken at the centerpiece.  You can always get traditional quarter or half chickens with delicious sides such as pan fried plantains, spicy beans or rice pilaf, and the chicken is delicious like Genaro's (better than Pio Pio). Or you can get the beloved quinoa stuffed avocado, salad or sandwich. The first time I went, I got the Naked Peruvian which provides perfectly ripe avocado with veggies and I neglected to order chicken on it. Well it was such a happy accident because it didn't need it- the smokiness of the grilled ciabatta compliments the veggies so much it is one of my favorite vegetarian meals! (Tip: the grilled ciabatta really is better eaten there and gets soggy if you take it to go)  The creamy aji amarillo (yellow pepper) complements the sandwich and just about all of the chicken dishes and adds some zingy spiciness without setting your mouth on fire.  In fact, even though I don't usually like creamy sauces, this is my favorite sauce I've ever had at a chicken place. The steak sandwich offers a more substantial option and is a house favorite. 

Desserts feature the alfajores (powdered sugar dulce de leche cookies), tres leches cake and flan. I make tres leches at home and I have to say that this is the only tres leches cake in Charlotte that holds its own against mine if I do say so myself. It is super moist and delicious without tasting of preservatives. I look forward to trying the Sangria sometime.

I am a huge fan of this place because of the food, décor and service so it already earned 5 stars in my book, but it gets extra credit because Mondays they donate portion of proceeds to a designated local nonprofit, and they use eco-friendly corn-based \"silverware\".  I'm surprised they don't use actual silverware because that is the most eco-friendly, but happy with the corn-based stuff. 

Tip: Go Mondays!"}
{"text":"The quinoa stuffed avocados were amazing! The kids had chicken (\"best I've ever had\", green beans and sweet potato fries . Excellent healthy Peruvian style lunch."}
{"text":"Que pero que rico! Food is amazing. Mi gente hispana, necesitan probar de este lugar. El poyo, arroz, yucca y plátano maduro es lo mejor."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes the online ordering is the best thing ever. Anything on the menu is fantastic, the hot sauce is to die for. One of my faves in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Food here is worth your money.  Flavorful chicken, unique sauces, and the beloved YUCCA!!! So happy to find a Venezuelan place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"When the family's happy, momma's happy. Picked up some Viva Chicken and sides and they were all delicious and fresh. Everyone enjoyed the flavors Peruvian (?) flavors. Always enjoy the avocado quinoa concoction. Pure deliciousness! A definite go to when you're just wanting a consistent delicious meal."}
{"text":"Being Peruvian and eating here is not that great. The food is ok but I wouldn't go back. Knowing how it should taste and eating this is disappointing. If you want real Peruvian food go to milo and Lala restaurant. It's great."}
{"text":"Fast service even when busy! I just recently tried this place and fell in love with their food. I got the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado with Chicken on top. It was so delicious and fresh. It leaves you with that clean-eating feeling.  I absolutely loved their quinoa, as well as their Sweet Potato Fries! For the sweet potato fries, if you get a side they give you enough to fries for 2-3 people, so I was excited that I had leftovers to take home. I will Definitely be back here to try more of their choices!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places for a great meal. If you care about taste and value then look no further. I recommend the fried rice with a half chicken. As an added plus this establishment took the amazing step of offering a discounted meal on Memorial Day for veterans \"dine with a vet.\" This place remains a family favorite."}
{"text":"First time here and already in love with the place!
Great environment, súper helpful and nice staff.
Food is delicious.
Coming from a family with Peruvian roots, I really enjoyed the flavours and spices. My dad also enjoyed the \"taste of his Peruvian roots\".
I fully recommend this place."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is a great go-to place for a healthy lunch or dinner at a relatively low price. It's one of the best restaurants in Charlotte at any price point and they have convenient locations throughout the city. Definitely one of the best restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The last few times we've been here, the nicest young man named Joshua has taken our order at the register. He has always been so welcoming as we approached and very genuine. Thanks Joshua, you're one of the reasons we come back often, and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Viva! It's a bi-weekly \"go-to\" for us. I love The Great sandwich. The bacon, cheese and avocado are a must add to the sandwich. Can't go wrong with the cilantro rice and fruit cup! Great staff and service. Very fast!"}
{"text":"If God made fries, he would throw them away to eat these fries. It's a beautiful moment when you get a hot basket of these little miracles."}
{"text":"They should rename Viva Chicken to Viva Fries. Without question, the best fries on the planet. Don't believe me- go there and try not to weep softly while you eat them. The chicken is good too, but you will know who the star is when you eat a fry."}
{"text":"We ate lunch here the other day, and really liked the food.  Everything was very tasty, and the only suggestion would be to cook the chicken and fried yucca a little more.  Other than that, we will def. be back to try the saltado and other dishes.  Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Amazing little chicken spot tucked away in uptown charlotte. Try the plantains. Try the chicken. Don't forget the green pepper sauce. I went back twice in the span of two days when visiting. And I left feeling healthy both times. 

Wash it down with the mint lemonade. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Great food, but \"club\" music is waaay too loud. Hopefully, that is only because they just opened.  I had the stuffed avocado and it was fresh and delicious. My husband had a sandwich and the bread was warm and fresh and the cilantro rice was great!"}
{"text":"Co-worker ordered a sandwich last night while we were working. He scrapped all the meat to one end, and then cut the sandwich in half to make nearly a sandwich.. No value at all on the sandwiches, and the chickens are SMALL...."}
{"text":"We love this place. We eat here everytime Jonny is in town from Atlanta. The chicken is tender, the service is quick, the prices are acceptable for Charlotte. 

LOCATION
Near CPCC, next to Earl's Grocery right on the \"trolley\" line. There is plenty of parking across the street. Don't be a noob and go for the side parking. If your car is even slightly past the white line, you will get a ticket.. plus, why would you want to pay for parking? 

AMBIENCE
Feels like a Peruvian Chipotle... except that you don't actually get to choose every ingredient that goes into your dish. There is seating enough for about ~50 people including the \"greenhouse\" area... but it does get very crowded. Try to avoid dining in during lunch and evening hours. 

FOOD
We like everything. It's all yummy. If it's your first visit, try the 1/4 chicken plate. That's a must. Try all three sauces (none of them aren't spicy... don't be deceived). Our other favorites are:

Quinoa-stuffed avocado  (add chicken)
The \"Great\"  wrap with sweet potato fries (ask for these extra crispy.. sometimes they're just not great)
Chicken Soup (small is enough.. the large is enough to feed at least 3)


They have an online take-out menu that you can order with. Use it. Do it to it, folks!"}
{"text":"The sauces really won me over. Quinoa stuffed avocados, fries tuca, chicken soup are all highlights"}
{"text":"This is the best Peruvian food, like ever.
They've got all kinds of choices (the sauces being the most important, of course), and I love how there is covered outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Ahh an old favorite. I'm still a huge fan of this place! And I'm super glad to have one on my side of town. 

We arrived just before the lunch rush. So we walked right up to the counter and placed our order. But beware - this place get super busy! So if you want to be in and grab a seat I'd recommend getting there any time before noon. 

I ordered the ¼ chicken with two sides - the yucca and a house salad. Everything was just as yummy as I remember them being the first time I tried this place. The chicken is so tender and packed with flavor. The yucca is cooked to perfection and the house balsamic dressing is amazing. 

All the sauces in the back are self-serve. I'd recommend trying them all....I like one for my yucca and a different one for my chicken. 

I really enjoy the food here. No matter what you chose you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Great service, the rice was pretty good, and the chicken...awesome! The sauces are excellent, the flavors, the passion fruit juice is absolutely delicious, and the vibe there is great. It's just a bunch of chicken lovers, loving chicken! I need to try more from their menu! Keep it up Viva! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tried their rotisserie chicken for the first time- absolutely loved it! Will def come back!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! Loved the staff & the options for health food & uniqueness!

You can watch your food being prepared & the wait is minimal for the amount of effort put into the food. I would recommend this place in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Had to wait 25 minutes for a $45 order, and of course it was messed up.
Asked two separate times \"where is my order, and why are people coming in after me getting their orders\"
Love the food, but if you cant manage a simple queue then I will go somewhere else"}
{"text":"My wife is from Peru, she cooks authentic food. This is one of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte and the closest to her cooking skills. The green sauce for their chicken is amazing! I go there at least once per week with our family."}
{"text":"Nicest staff ever!! Customer Service is a 10! Food is also equally delicious. Favorite location hands down."}
{"text":"not sure all the hype 
believe me it was busy
when i went to the counter to order and tell the girl it was my first time there and i was interest in some recommendations she could have cared less!  reluctantly she told me a few items, i ordered and my food was super dry and honestly nothing special"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today and it was my first experience with Peruvian food (though I've been to neighboring Ecuador, and they have many similar dishes).  I got the Sopa de Pollo (chicken soup) and Hey, Causita (best described as a little tower of alternating layers of chicken salad and mashed potatoes).
The soup was OK, not overly flavorful, but not bad... Just kinda there.  
The Hey, Causita was very good.  Chicken salad and mashed potatoes may sound like an odd mix, but it was delicious.
The staff was very friendly and service was fairly quick.  I'd go back for the Hey, Causita.  Check out the little Elizabeth Creamery ice cream shop next door as well!"}
{"text":"I love going in the summer and sitting on their patio - it's so beautiful! Hey causita is yummy, but tastes quite similar to the quinoa stuffed avocado so I wouldn't get both. The quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken on top is so good and I always have some left over! The inca wrap was good also and had a nice blend of flavors - but nothing to write home about like the avocado. The herbal lemonade is addictingly delicious. The food always comes out super fast so it's great for a quick lunch before getting back to work."}
{"text":"A nice play for grab and go Peruvian. Though I have another favorite in the city. Very reminiscent of a Peruvian Salsarita's. Great for take out - get the family meal deal for sure."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  I drive from Southpark frequently to get their fabulous roasted chicken and the amazing aji amarillo (yellow pepper) sauce that goes on everything - get one to dip sandwiches - SO GOOD.  Highly recommend: \"The Great\" pulled chicken sandwich with smoked pepper mayo - add avocado, very fresh crusty bread.  Don't miss the chicha morada - purple corn drink that cools your tongue after the spicy aji sauce.  Herbal lemonade equally delicious.  OH, the quinoa stuffed avocado is REALLY good, order with pulled chicken on top for an entree.  Service is always excellent and owners are friendly and welcoming.  Great patio.  Great for casual dates. Love!!"}
{"text":"Good food, I really liked the quality and the service was great. Order the Tacu Bowl with chicken and loved it!"}
{"text":"Peruvian Happy Hour?!?! Well, I don't mind if I do! 

I stopped in for the lunch special which includes a1/4 chicken, fries, salad AND a drink for only $5.95!!!

Let's start out with the staff...they were all superb! I was welcomed when I walked in with a smile, asked if I had any questions or needed suggestions and then given a reward card...it only takes 5 purchases until you get a free meal free!!! Whoo hooo!

I didn't have to wait long, and my food arrived. I loved the salad. It comes with cucumbers, tomatoes and feta cheese. And the dressing was delicious!!! My taste buds were very happy!!! 

The chicken and fries arrived HOT. Very, very tasty! I loved the crispy fries and the well seasoned and very moist chicken. Yummy!!! I really enjoyed mixing the chicken and the fries in the accommodating yellow sauce which was a little spicy, just like I like it! 

There are so many more things on the menu that I look forward to trying off their menu! I definitely can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Experience:
We had family in town from Canada. We had three adults and four children; two of them under the age of three. We ordered Arroz Chaufa, the Whole Chicken with three sides, and drinks for the table. The two youngest ones were busy being young children. The waitstaff was amazingly helpful to get us set up to eat by getting grabbing all of our plates and cutlery, the napkins, and even got all of our drinks and sauces at the station. Such kindness from the waitstaff to the point they were constantly attentive to ensure we were able to eat. I requested to speak to the manager and unexpectedly got the owner who was kind, personable, and extremely appreciative.

Floor and Ambiance:
We actually eat at this restaurant every once in a while for lunch and the restaurant is super busy during those times. The restaurant is always clean and well stocked. The tables and chairs are always wiped down almost immediately after someone gets up from a finished meal so that you can sit to eat. They have a small covered outside patio that you can eat and the delivery of the food comes right to the table immediately after being cooked. The only slight drawback is that the sauce counter and soda fountain is a hotspot for foot traffic within the restaurant, but can easily be remedied.

Food:
The food is excellent! From the rotisserie Peruvian chicken to the Arroz Chaufa, they blend the best combination of leveled savory tones which and cook it to perfection keeping the chicken soft and moist. I've not experienced one single dry piece of chicken yet. With a similar spice profile, the fried rice is exceptionally filling and plentiful. The salads are humongous and the sandwiches are hearty. I always take a to-go box home with me and share with the kids. We had a couple of the desserts and both the tres leches and churros will fill that sweet tooth longing, but not make you feel overly saturated with sugar or overindulged. 

Cost:
This, in my opinion, is the best part and a fantastic value for such a reward when you think about everything that you get with your purchase. One example is the rotisserie chicken and three sides. 

Cleanliness, exceptional service, fantastic food, large portions, and low prices make this one of my favorite places to eat. I want this place to continue to be successful so that Charlotte can continue to expand it's culinary diversity and keep places like this around."}
{"text":"So, I'm conflicted. 

During my first two visits I ordered \"The Great\" ($7.50) (Pulled rotisserie chicken, onions, tomato, lettuce, smoked rocoto mayo, grilled artisan ciabatta bread) which was delicious both times. Most recently, I ordered the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado ($7.95) (organic quinoa, onions, cucumber, tomato, cilantro, olive oil, lime plus pulled chicken $1.95). The sandwich was delicious both times but the stuffed avocados, though pretty looking, just didn't impress me.

The chicken was dry and flavorless and the avocado was not ripe enough making it difficult to eat. Another at the table complained of dry flavorless chicken too and unfortunately for him he had the 1/2 platter. A big bummer because, until this trip Viva Chicken, was easily my favorite lunch spot in Charlotte.

I will still absolutely return and know to stick with the sandwich. PS: the sauces (don't know what they're called) are DELICIOUS. Also, try the Yucca!

I do love the interior and the patio with pretty gutter planters. Order at the counter, grab a number and they'll bring it out to you. VERY busy if you come right a noon, may even be busy if you come at 11:45, but the lines and food does seem to come quick.

So one mediocre trip out of 3? Viva, you're still a four in my book!"}
{"text":"Best place in town for a quick, healthy and good meal!  The food is fantastic, especially the chicken and green beans.  The sauces are great as well, I recommend the orange one."}
{"text":"I've heard so much hype about Viva Chicken and it had been on my bucket list forever. Though now that I've gone, I've got to get back and try the quinoa stuffed avocado or chicken plate with sides.

As a newbie, I stressed out at order time and just went with the viva chicken salad. It was still delicious but next time I'll branch out more. I was so impressed at how tender yet flavorful the pulled chicken was. Well done, viva, well done. The house dressing was fantastic, and is similar to a balsamic. In addition to the delicious house dressing, I also opted for some of the ajo amarillo (mild) sauce - I can see why it's a crowd favorite! The salad was pretty big, so you're getting your money's worth. Service was prompt, and each person I encountered was friendly. 

FYI - they do have wireless in there as well, though I wouldn't recommend sitting in there to work during the busy lunch/dinner hours where table space is a necessity. Luckily, all Viva lovers in North Charlotte can be happy they also have a location next to Whole Foods Huntersville."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for a quick and delicious meal. Fast but NOT fast food. It's all good and the flavors are terrific. Counter service so no hassle and no tipping. Always friendly. Always fresh and we have visited MANY times. No bad experiences."}
{"text":"My first time here and the food was very good.  Very juicy chicken and I loved the various sauces for dipping.  However, next time I'll take it to go.  This place was so loud and I felt like I was in Peruvian nightclub.  When I left it really hit me how unnerving it was.  So food is good but if you're looking for a relaxing lunch, forget about it."}
{"text":"Omg absolutely love this restaurant. I had the rotisserie chicken with the cilantro rice and fried yucca. Everything was absolutely delicious especially when u add the sauces!!!  

I've been trying to find something similar to a Pollo Tropical (Miami fast food restaurant) and this compared to be better. I like redact that they are very Eco friendly and the staff were friendly and very attentive to your needs. 

I'll definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The best chicken EVER!!!!! So much perfect flavor, so perfect everything, spunky music, nice service! The sweet potato fries are the best fries I have ever ever eaten ever!!! The fresh fruit is super good, I love the amount that you get. They have fancy juices that I didn't like, oh well! Please go!!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service.  Cannot wait to work my way through their entire Simple menu.  Wholesome.  Tasty.   Becoming a weekly staple!  Im obsessed with the soup.  And salad."}
{"text":"I have mix feeling about viva, food is way overpriced and is not the best.
I feel that if their concept is a Peruvian fast food, they should try to be more authentic to Peruvian Flavors, is just a chicken place with a Peruvian twist... love their stuffed avocados ..."}
{"text":"I really don't know where to start with this place. Everything is good. EV-ERY-THING.  I find the best value with the Tacu Bowl w/ Chicken; it's so much food for less that $9.  Every layer is always perfect from the rice & beans to the onion/tomato salsa to the shredded rotisserie chicken.  Don't forget to order extra Aji Amarillo sauce because you'll need it.  This is quite possibly the best \"sauce\" I've ever encountered.  I swipe my finger to pick up the remains every time, so that says it all.

As far as the sides are concerned, nothing is short of excellent.  I've had fried yuca many times before including South Florida (and one anonymous place down Central Ave here in CLT), but Viva consistently delivers the best I've ever had.  Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside.  Dip that bad boy in the Aji sauce and you're in business.  The fried plantains are also clutch.  I haven't ventured toward much else, but why would I?  I'm here for the Peruvian food.

Viva has a great product and they're booming.   They've got healthy, delicious food that you order at the counter.  Don't forget to wash it down with one of the eclectic Hispanic beverages, Cheerwine on tap, or local beers!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience!  Love the new location at North Hills in Raleigh, NC!  The Andina Power Food salad was delicious (definitely add the peruvian pulled chicken to it).  The sides are all so yummy.  Service was very attentive and prices were more than reasonable.  Will definitely be back!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Just got Viva Chicken to go. Started eating my salad and then noticed that the chicken on top is pink and raw..... omg. So disgusting. I really hope I did not eat enough of it to get sick! Picture attached..."}
{"text":"Absolute winner winner chicken dinner, or lunch, or take out. Viva is delicious with from scratch sauces that allow you to customize every visit. The chicken is the best rotisserie you'll find. Looks fast casual but way way more and better. Wish I lived closer because this would be a weekly staple."}
{"text":"It's hard not to like this place. The food is well flavored and good quality. The prices are reasonable and the service is friendly. The atmosphere is fun and has an energetic vibe. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The food is usually delicious, but today rotisserie chicken wasn't done all the way it was pink I told the waiter that it was paid and she tried to give me an excuse why because of the way they cooked it, so she bought me another chicken and the quarter legs was pink, all they can do is apologize,... Friendly warning double check your rotisserie chicken to make sure that it is well done expecially the dark meat!"}
{"text":"We visited just as they opened on a Saturday lunchtime.  Not very busy when we arrived but more folks by the time we left.  I liked the fact that they had a local beer option.  I had the quarter chicken white meat with green beans and infused rice.  The chicken was extremely tasty and the sauces that they provide are fantastic.  I was very impressed with the way they cook the green beans.  I could tell that they were pan grilled just before being placed on the plate.  Nice place.  Clean. Relaxed.  Yummy food.  Good beer.  All at a reasonable price.  A must go if in the area.   They rated one of my rare five star ratings!"}
{"text":"The family loved it -
Fresh flavorful food 
Nice variety of sides and sauces. 
We ordered on-line and picked it up - 
Our order was correct 
On time 
The food was hot and plenty of It. 

We would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This review is going to be easy and short...

Awesome! 

Try it. I'll bet you'll love it. Instant favorite!"}
{"text":"I noticed all the great reviews on Yelp. My girlfriend I recently visited this restaurant and we loved it. I have always loved Peruvian food. We ordered the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado and the Classic Saltado. The wraps look good also, I may try that next time."}
{"text":"Great chicken, chicha morada and fried yuca!!!  Small place but great to grab something to go! Fast service!"}
{"text":"Up until recently I used to love this place. On Thursday I did a take-out order and a short while after eating my meal I got very ill= excruciating stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea. I contacted the establishment via their website form to let them know about this and politely requested that they double-check their products. The email I received in response was callous and defensive; a denial that anything was spoiled/contaminated and indirectly calling me a liar about having food poisoning! Mind you, that was the ONLY thing I had eaten so far that day [plus I couldn't consume anything after that except drinking Pedialyte] and up until eating their food I had felt great. Needless to say, after the email I received from customer service rep Randy I will not be giving anymore of my business to an establishment that values their egos more than their customers health! Eat there at your own risk and be prepared for a \"It couldn't have been us\" response in case you do get ill from the food and inform them of it.

Update: the Health Dept did an inspection after I contacted them about this issue and found several violations! Feel free to look it up being it's public record."}
{"text":"Very nice experience.   Very cool atmosphere.  Service was incredible.   Food quality and pricing pretty good also.  Fried green app was awesome.  We are looking forward to going back in the summer time and enjoying the outside deck & rooftop."}
{"text":"I love everything about Viva Chicken..especially their chicken soup.  And now they are opening at the Waverly. so cool"}
{"text":"First let me say I love Viva Chicken, but this was my first time at this new location and wow!! I didn't think I could love them any more but I DO!!  Park rd location is so clean & fresh, the staff was amazing!!  Friendly, kind & taking care of their guests. All of the utensils, napkins, sauces and accoutrements were fully stocked.  Wait time was minimal even though it was quite busy on a Tuesday night.  The great staff checked on us several times to make sure we were doing ok, engaged us in friendly conversation, refilled our drinks/sauces for us several times so we didn't have to get up.  The food was amazing as always, consistent with the Viva that we love!!  A family favorite for sure!! The manager should be very proud of their staff and chefs at the Park rd location.  We could not have asked for more. Awesome dinner experience after a hard day.  Love that this location is so close to us. We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat! Love the rotisserie chicken, the fried rice. Fried yucca. Salad. Chicha Morada. You can't go wrong here! Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"For being a chain fast food restaurant, I have to express that I am impressed. Every location that I have been to has been clean, fast, and most importantly the food is fresh and tastes delicious. I love the options on the menu and the chicken tastes so good! A great place to go with the family and while it's a more expensive fast food restaurant, the cost is seen in the service, cleanliness and quality of the food!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally get to try out Viva Chicken. I have heard the rave reviews for months but never had the chance until now. I did try to come once for work lunch, but the line was way too long. It is clear that this place is popular. The service was extremely friendly and the cashier was extra helpful with explaining what everything on the menu was. Here is what we had and what I thought:

Fried Yuka- Amazing! Love some fried yuka
Beans- Really great beans! Extra smoky flavor
French Fries- They have really great fries here!
Chicken- Chicken was good, but nothing better than your average Peruvian chicken place. We were disappointed that our chicken was not very warm. 
Tres Leches- Way too sweet for me
Passion fruit Juice- Delicious!!

The sauces for dipping were really great! The one bummer was the chicken. I would recommend this as a quicker option for someone who likes Pio Pio. This place does not beat Pio Pio but it is a solid place!!"}
{"text":"So glad to see another Viva Chicken pop up. The service was extremely friendly and the cashier was extra helpful with explaining what everything on the menu was. Customer service success yet again at this new location.

Here is what we had and what I thought:

Fried Yuka- Amazing! Love some fried yuka
Beans- Really great beans! Extra smoky flavor
French Fries- They have really great fries here!
Chicken- Chicken was good, but nothing better than your average Peruvian chicken place. 
Tres Leches- Way too sweet for me
Passion fruit Juice- Delicious!!

The sauces for dipping were really great! The yellow one is addicting"}
{"text":"Viva is fantastic!! This is the second location I have been to and the service is just as great. 

Quick post for Quick dining: the rotisserie chicken is so flavorful and not dry at all. The servings are pretty hefty- my husband and I split the 1/2 chicken and 2 sides and were stuffed. In the past I've tried the sweet potato fries, the fried plantains and the regular fries. All excellent side choices. Today we went with a little cleaner option and did green beans and chicken soup with our half chicken. Still yummy! Their juices are soooooo good! You'd never think to put some of the flavors together the way they do, but it works. 

My absolute fav thing is the quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken. Holy crap. Add a little of the red sauce and that's what I call a meal. Oh speaking of sauces- literally you could not like anything on the menu and dress something up with one of their sauces and rejoice. Just excellent. 

All in all, this is what I would call Peruvian comfort fast food, and they do an amazing job."}
{"text":"Chicken and yuca fries are great.  I can't eat the rice or couscous because they put so many raw onions.  Looking forward to trying more!"}
{"text":"The quinoa stuffed avocados with chicken are almost life-changing. The sauces that come on it are the perfect finishing piece for this dish. Would order this 100x over again. Also split a 1/4 chicken with rice as well ... didn't disappoint at all. Their mild sauce for the chicken is orgasmic. The rice was a HUGE portion with huge flavor. This might be my new go-to spot when I'm in the Elizabeth Square area! 2 thumbs way up for this little place."}
{"text":"This location is closer to me, but I got sick the one time I came here. Had the 1/4 white chicken meal.  Maybe it was a fluke, but have eaten at two other locations with no issues."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is my new favorite lunch spot, but I had to give this three stars because three times out of the six times I've been here, there has been an issue with my order.  

I always order the quinoa-stuffed avocado (a must try if you haven't had it!) with a side house salad.  The first time, my avocado arrived with chicken and had to be sent back.  The second time, I received a salad with chicken (no avocado or house salad).  The third time (which happened yesterday, 5/19), I placed an order online for pick up that, according to the confirmation email I received, was to be ready at 12:44pm.  I arrived at 1pm to pick it up, and the order had been lost.  I showed the email to the staff at the register.  I did not receive an apology from the staff, all I was told was that the kitchen was backed up and that they would try to push the order through.  I received it ten minutes later.  

Will I go back?  Probably, because I love the avocado.  In the meantime, I think I will be taking a break so hopefully I'll have better luck next time."}
{"text":"Customer service is PHENOMENAL. The bus guy is so so so nice. He's so positive, full of energy and genuine. Literally make my day and meal so much better every time. 

Everything is good here. The juice and the green sauce is a MUST. I come here when I want to be healthy (wanting chick fil a)  but not too healthy (salad is too plain) lol

P/s:The location in uptown near CPCC offer student discount."}
{"text":"My first time was great. I have a Caesar salad with chicken. It was good and well priced for lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I love but somehow manage to forget about and then when I remember again I think to myself, why don't we come here more often. 

I tend to order the great sandwich- add provolone and add avocado, with fries. I love this meal and it will always be a favorite of mine since it was the first real food I had after giving birth to my baby girl. 

My husband has ordered several other menu items, including the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado, which looked delicious and he confirmed it was and his favorite lately has been the Classic Saltado which is a delicious combo of beef, fries and rice. i have tried this and truly enjoy it- but still like to get the same sandwich b/c I am such a creature of habit. 

Eating in has always been a pleasure as everyone we have encountered who works here has been super nice and helpful. I really like that all of the products they use are eco-friendly as it seems so many places tend to use Styrofoam and i am all about saving the planet and all that jazz. 

Now that I have written this review I will have to remember to go there again soon."}
{"text":"So good! Love the chicken soup! So glad we gave it a try.  My husband gets the quarter chicken and has tried several sides.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So this place comes extremely highly rated everywhere around Charlotte so after an exhausting round of golf (mostly exhausting because of how bad I played), I figured viva chicken would be a quick meal on my drive home.

Peruvian fast food who would have thought...

This place is packed at 4:30 on a Sunday. Families, college kids, old people, basically everyone was here.  definitely a cross section and diverse clientele..... great vibe.

The staff was very helpful and Jocelyn went out of her way to make some recommendations and also to walk me through the process.

The cashier recommended a sandwich, but I want fried rice, and also the 1/4 dark rotisserie chicken.  Eyewitness her recommendation for the green beans the plantanes, but when I sat down and was waiting for my food Jocelyn asked me if I had gotten the French fries. After trying the green means I probably should have gotten the fries.

The chicken was very tasty.  It's tender and has a very good seasoning. The plantain's were excellent, and perfectly cooked. But, the green beans were average at best, nothing special. As a matter of fact, trying them just before I left, they were better, so apparently they're better cold."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.   I thought it was going to be just chicken (a la the name) but they had a number of vegetarian options.   I had the naked peruvian wrap which was delicious!      Great, cozy atmosphere and part of 4 (including 1 glass of wine) for under $40!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome Food, Atmosphere and Service!

I've been here approx 6 times.  My favorite is the Naked Peruvian with Chicken and Plantains.   Also love the fried Rice and Wow Lomito"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, the best chicken in the world!
I love the flavors they were able to add to the chicken. The skin was crispy yet the meat remained flawlessly juicy.
Their french fries (my go-to side) was impressively crunchy as well!
The fried rice was pretty good, although slightly bland.

The wait is worth it.
The crowd/ruckus might get annoying but I'm telling you, their food is unbelievably good.
Amazing deal for how much amazing food you get!
Just try to avoid rush hour times."}
{"text":"If I only had a rotisserie apparatus attached to my grill, I wouldn't need to visit this place so often. 

I usually order 1/4 chicken with plantains (island girl at heart). On a recent trip, my buddy ordered the Arroz Chaufa with chicken. (Fried rice, red peppers, green onions, eggs, ginger, and Peruvian soy sauce). I added a the ajillo pepper sauce and have been hooked ever since. It's guilt free food, healthy and tasty.

My last visit, I placed a carryout order. I got a kids meal, which comes with a drink and a side. No guilt, as it was lunch and dinner...had arroz chaufa, extra chicken, plantains and an herbal limeade...came out winning."}
{"text":"It was our first visit and we got decent service at the ordering station. I know some of  the other reviews rave about the friendliness, maybe our guys had a loooong day. Anyway, the decor is clean with warm dark colors.  The food arrived quickly. We also liked how you can see the cooks prepare. The beans looked like Northern beans, which was fine and tasted good. Not sure if they offer black beans, which we love. The cilantro rice is yummy with the added greens peas and carrots.  The chicken was moist, tender, and flavorful. My only problem was mine was red in some spots, which they quickly fixed. That happens in any place where they rotisserie the chicken. Plaintains were cooked perfectly. The prices were reasonable and moderate. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time. Had the Quinoa stuffed Avacado starter and a delicious chicken-rice bowl. I want one of these places in my town! So easy to find paleo-type meals. Or at lease gluten and dairy free.

The dips/sauces accompaning the dishes were flavorful and just the right level of spice.

Ordering is similar to McAllister's where you place the order and get a number so they can find you. Nice covered patio for enjoying the weather. Oh, and serve yourself drink fountain.

Definitely worth many repeats."}
{"text":"Finally today I stopped in to place a take out order. I decided to try the rotisserie chicken - 1/4 white meat with plantains & green beans. I tried all 3 sauces and my favorite is the green Huacatay sauce. This stuff is so delish!

The chicken was perfectly seasoned... it tasted great on its own and with the green sauce. I love plantains and these were very good. I ended up getting green beans as my second side. That was a good choice because they were roasted with little bits of red bell pepper and had a nice seasoning...tasty!

All of this delicious food for only $8.75 (before tax) makes this a nice go-to lunch spot that offers great food at reasonable prices.

I did not try any of their beverages this time since I was getting take out...but after seeing some of the other reviews, I know I want to give some of their beverages a try in the future. (Purple Peruvian Corn and Herbal Lemonade both sound yummy!)

They also have some yummy sweet treats, which I did not try on this visit. But I love Tres Leches & Churros, so I will definitely splurge on dessert on one of my future visits.

If you are just going for takeout, you can order online before you go. However, despite my going in at a very busy lunch hour, I placed my order when I arrived and it was ready in under 10 minutes!

Also, they have a catering menu online so if you if are having an event with 15+ people, they have some nice options starting at $6.50 - $10.00 per person (depending on which package you choose.)"}
{"text":"Their quinoa stuffed avocados are out of this world! Their chicken is also delicious, as are their sauces (not too different than any other peruvian chicken I've had).  But seriously - don't miss the quinoa stuffed avocados - sort of have a sushi-inspired flavor.  I crave these things! So good! The ambiance is nice, too - inside is nothing special (do have some cool light fixtures) but their outside patio is walled in with plants and makes for a nice, slightly private feeling."}
{"text":"Super clean & healthy. Great lunch spot. Although this is an order at the counter type of place where you pick up your order and seat yourself... the staff was super friendly and will ask you if you need anything at your table."}
{"text":"don't get confused by CHICKEN in the name of restaurant. Lot of veggie options. Food tastes really fresh . all dipping sauces are yum. yuca fries were great.fast service and mint juice was very refreshing."}
{"text":"Seriously get food here for your next lunch or dinner. It is amazing! It is affordable bliss! Everything is good so try something new each time. Enjoy"}
{"text":"What an amazing lunch! We shared our choices and everything was incredible. My personal favorite was avocado stuffed with quinoa. Wow! As a fan of all things avocado, I was absolutely blown away by this dish. Had a half order with sweet potato fries and couldn't finish. Did  a have a bite of 2 of the wraps. Both yummy.. Can't go wrong here. Very flavorful dishes. The sauces were all good and fun to mix up and try. The red pepper one had quite a kick! 
My husband had the herbal limeade-seemed to be basil-infused. Yum!
Fun to enjoy some unique flavors in everything we ordered. I'm ready to go back and try something different! 
A real value for your money. A must try and a must return!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants that I go on my lunch break. I ordered the quartered chicken white with plantains and salad. It is delicious! Try the mango drink- it is so good that when you get half way drinking it I add ice to prolong it. Lol it's that good. The prices are decent and worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. It's always good. The staff I have encountered have been awful. Very rude and just very duhhhhhh. Anything you ask for seems to frustrate them and don't ask a question and expect a response. I guess you can't have everything!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised as I was expecting a fast food experience and taste. 

The flavor and quality of the food was amazing. 

The Aztec wrap with pulled chicken is very tasty. Not greasy or dried out like some other wraps you will get at competitors. 

Delicious"}
{"text":"This place didn't really impress me. Their chickens have no meat on them, almost like their chickens were starving just like their customers after they walk out of this place. This place is a little pricy compared to other places, I would give them a 3 star compared to El Pollo Loco and Boston Market. It's worth trying it at least once, make sure to try their green sauce."}
{"text":"We visited Viva Chicken on Saturday 1/3/15.   Finding this restaurant was a great find.  The food and service were great. 
Food: Great 
We both ordered the 1/4 chicken with two sides. This gave us the chance to try four different sides: Canary Beans, Yucca Fries, Cilantro Infused Rice and Sweet Plantains.   
The chicken had a great flavor and was very moist. It came with two sauces a mild and a medium sauce.  The mild sauce (yellow color) was my favorite.  Although it wasn't hot, it had a lot of great flavors.  The medium sauce (green color) was good, but didn't have as much flavor as the mild sauce. 
The sides were good.  The Cilantro Infused Rice was our favorite side as it had just the right flavors.  I can't wait to try several more of the 11 different sides that they have available.
I mentioned visiting Viva Chicken to a co-worker.  Her family is from Peru, she se mentioned that this is their favorite Peruvian restaurant.  It offers the most authentic Peruvian food that her parents have tasted since moving here. 
Portion Size = Perfect
The portion size of the meals was also great. I was full and still had a little food left on the plate.
Service = 5 star restaurant.
At first glance the restaurant seems to be a high scale fast food restaurant.  A place where you fill up your own  soft drinks and get your own napkins and utensils from a condiments table.  But the service I received was better than I've received in many upscale restaurants.  It was almost as if the waiters were reading our minds.  As we filled our cups, the waiter offered to give us straws and lids.  Once we got to the table and our food arrived, the waiter saw I had forgotten get a spoon for my soup.  So he brought a spoon over to me. When he noticed that my wife and I were tasting each other's sides, he brought over a spoon for her also.  He also offered to refill my drink.  We also had a manager stop by to make sure we were enjoying our meal.
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes rotisserie chicken, Peruvian food or just looking for a great new place to eat."}
{"text":"Visited Viva Chicken's Elizabeth St location today. The food was very good; but the overall experience was not as good as our trip to the Ballentyne location. 
We had the 1/2 avocado appetizer to start. I had The Great pulled chicken sandwich with extra avocado and a side of fries. My wife had the 1/4 chicken with cilantro rice and green beans.
Food:  very good
We were happy we choose to order the 1/2 avocado appetizer. Since there were only two of us it was the perfect size.  We thought it was good not great.
My chicken sandwich was good; but a little on the dry side.  The fries were very good.  
The 1/4 chicken was also a little dry; but still had a good taste.  The rice was very good.  The green beans were our favorite. They were grilled and had a lot of flavor.
Service.  We were disappointed by the service.  At the Ballentyne restaurant we received great service. At this location it truly felt like we were in a fast food restaurant.
Overall I thought it was a good meal; but next time I will take the extra few minutes and drive to Ballentyne."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Elizabeth!  The food here is very delicious and I love the fact they use environmentally friendly items!  Get the rotisserie chicken!   Its great!"}
{"text":"This is for real my new favorite place to eat for casual dining in Charlotte. I've always loved Peruvian style chicken but for the price and the quality, this place can't be beat! Not to mention the staff is top notch and super attentive and helpful.

I can't wait to eat there again. I dream about it sometimes."}
{"text":"Nester, was very nice and accommodating,  He gave us suggestions  on some of the menu  items, great choices, chicken, green bean and plantains. Great Service,  Thanks
P.S. The Basil Lemonade  was  excellent!!"}
{"text":"I order here from all the time and today was just awful. My sandwich had a giant piece of fat in it and it was disgusting. It made me not want to eat the whole thing. Usually they're really good but today was awful. I don't know how they missed it because it was so huge. Hoping it was just a fluke."}
{"text":"What can I say other than Deeeelish! This is my new favorite place to eat. Healthy and affordable. I usually go to the Ballantyne location. Amazing food."}
{"text":"Millennial version of Boston Market. Fair but  a little pricey.  Boston Market better value for the money and taste."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken catering on Park Road is absolutely wonderful. My company orders catering often and we have officially added Viva Chicken to the list. Kate the catering manager is a delight to work with. Our company was pleased with the service and LOVED the food. We highly recommend Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 1/4 Rotisserie chicken with cilantro rice and side salad .  Order at walk up counter and they bring it to your table.  I didn't care for the yellow mild sauce it had a creamy texture I didn't want.  The chicken itself was very delicious and had a nice seasoning.  The cilantro rice was fantastic, butter and had peas and carrots in it.  Good way to sneak in some extra veggie.  The herbal lemonade was amazing, sweet, sort of a rosemary flavor.  
This was so much food I wasn't even able to eat the side salad.  They have lots of other things, so I need to go back.I loved the eco-friendly vibe, compo stable tableware and lots of awareness.  That was nice.  I parked across the street for free."}
{"text":"Great food!  The chicken, plantains and the Peruvian sauces awesome.  
Was on a business trip and we tried it one evening, and before the week was finished we went again for lunch."}
{"text":"We have gone here for work related functions so many times and everytime it's a winner. If your feeling under the weather try the chicken soup. It's amazingly good. I've never left there disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my second time at a Viva Chicken, the first at this location since it just opened a week or so ago. IT WAS PACKED! However, the line moved pretty quickly. We were getting our order to go, so next time we will likely place our order online. For some reason, I don't remember being as impressed with the food as I was this time. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sides of green beans and cilantro rice and fries were so yummy! I love, love, love the spicy sauce. It pairs so well with the chicken, I even dunked my fries in there. This will probably be my \"go to\" spot when I want something healthy. I'll order the chicken and green beans only."}
{"text":"5 stars for customer service. They reached out through yelp after my review to apologize again and offer me a gift card. Very awesome customer service !! And the food is delish :)"}
{"text":"I haven't tasted Peruvian food before. I love the food here it tastes so good. I tried grilled chicken with two sides. Fried yuka and plantains are my favorite. The sauces are so good too."}
{"text":"I went to pickup food for the office and me and 3 other employees got really sick within minutes of eating!  I was the only vegetarian and ordered a side of fries not knowing how huge a side was so I shared them. I'm sure that's why we're sick and I have no idea how this happened but I'm taking a break from Viva."}
{"text":"I headed here for lunch (on a weekday) with fellow yelpers, Dion L. & Katie S.

While I can still see the old Starbucks layout in my mind, Viva did a great job remoldeling this space & making it their own. The interior of the restaurant is warm & inviting, although it is very small. 

The lady at the register was very friendly & clearly has a good memory. She knew by heart was Dion would order. I on the other hand went against chicken & chose the \"Wow Limito\" (sirloin steak sandwich) & fries.

We decided to sit outside on the patio - which is lovely, by the way. You're surrounded by plants all along the \"walls.\" 

We didn't wait but about five minutes & all our entrees arrived.  My sandwich was perfect, the toppings fresh & the steak cooked thoroughly. The fries we hot, crispy & plentiful. The mustardy-yellow sauce that accompanied was delicious! It had a nice \"kick\" to it.

The prices are hit & miss. Some entrees/dishes seem to be a bit overpriced, while others are reasonable.

If you're a fan of Pio Pio &/or Peruvian food, do yourself a favor & head on over to Viva Chicken."}
{"text":"I didn't feel like cooking tonight so I ordered takeout online.  Decided to try it because of the fresh organic ingredients. I was not disappointed! I had the haucatay Caesar salad with pulled chicken.  My husband had the limena chopped salad with chicken. And our son had the pulled chicken w/fries from the kids menu. Wow.  The place was packed yet so clean. Walked right in and and grabbed our food. The flavors were delicious and the food was fresh. I  fed the family for $25 and didn't have to cook. A win/win! We will be back."}
{"text":"If you have not tasted Peruvian food, then this place is a must visit. I am an eggetarian and I love their Arroz Chaufa and Tacu Bowl. The price is affordable with great taste. The sauce is their unique selling point. I do not know their names but they are out of the world. It adds unique taste to the dish."}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could! The food is so flavorful, a great serving side (I try to save some for lunch the next day but lack the restraint), and the employees are kind quick and efficient. Make sure you don't forget to get the sauces while there or before you take a to go order. The sauces really take this food over the top! 

Thanks Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"I love there food!!!! It's pretty good! Never had a problem with the service. I had Peruvian food before. This place is quick but really good"}
{"text":"Bored of eating the same old sub or salad everyday for lunch?  Me too, I  really needed some new lunch choices and something close to work and boy oh boy was I happy to find Viva Chicken.  If you haven't tried Peruvian food yet then this is your chance, and you will not be disappointed. 

Thanks to JJ G.'s review I went for the Tacu Bowl (but with chicken) for me!  It's the delicious green sauce that really made the dish, I don't recall the name but I'll take a gallon of it please.  Fresh avocados and plenty of food to fill this hungry belly.  The menu has plenty of options even for the picky eaters out there.  I also noticed a summer menu at the register featuring some good looking salads.  

While looking around the restaurant you can see just about every patron munching on the Pollo a la Brasa (Peruvian rotisserie chicken) I know this is the thing to get at this restaurant and I can't wait to get back to try it.  You can even order a whole chicken and sides to go walla dinner is served. 

For lunch or dinner Viva is a great choice the outdoor patio is awesome and filled with plants and cute decor.  Even though it's counter service you still feel like your getting full service at you table.  Fast, healthy, and authentic just what I was looking for!"}
{"text":"I'm a long-time lover of Peruvian cuisine and anything that even hints at having plantains, yucca, rotisserie/grilled chicken, and South American pastries....or anything with \"Dulce de Leche\" in the name. I'm a sucker, I know, but Viva exudes all of the aspects of a staple in town for a quick-service resto. It was pretty astonishing to learn that this joint is totally Charlotte-based. 

There are so many things that gave this experience 5 out of 5 for me. 

Service: Holy cow. The woman at the register was super helpful. She gave me some background on everything I had questions about. I'm a firm believer that the more questions you ask, the more likely you are to find out what you'll end up loving. The gentleman working the line was equally helpful. He gave us some background on the housemade drinks, Inca Kola (tastes exactly like bubblegum, by the way), other processes, Peruvian cuisine, and the back story. They give you a number if you dine in and bring your order to your table. They were even so kind to spell everything out, give some info on flavors of the different Aji (sauces), and came back to ask how everything was. Top notch service indeed. 

The flavors. Oh, my. First, The Great. This is the staple chicken sandwich under this roof and it's a force of culinary nature. It all starts in the \"Green Oven\" they have straight from Peru. It's a rotisserie/grill hybrid that gives the chicken immaculate flavor. Imagine pulled, tender, juicy chicken with charred flavor and absolutely no compromise in texture/chew. I was astounded. It is served on ciabatta with red onion, tomatoes, and a spread of some sauce. Add avocado and provalone. You won't be sorry you did. 

The yucca and plantains were top notch. Dunked heavily in the Aji Amarillo and the green Aji sauce. I'd eat these with every meal. 

We also ordered the avocado stuffed with quinoa. Sounds odd, looks odd, tastes AMAZING. Balsamic is a nice touch. Don't be scared. Just try it if it's your style. 

The alfajores, shortbread cookies with dulce de leche, are incredible. Coated in powdered sugar and only beckon a tall glass of milk. Buy them in two or four packs. They make these suckers in-house, too. 

Inca Kola. Loved it, so interesting, can't wait to have it again. Ever wondered what a liquid version of Bazooka bubblegum would taste like? Here ya go. 

Prices vary on dishes. Some of the entrees are a little more pricey (as expected) and the sandwiches, sides, and apps are a bit more modest in price. Definitely a little more pricey than some, but you can get out the door with a meal under your belt for between $10-$15 no problem.

The whole experience was awesome. I loved all of the background on the concept, preparation, kitchen, etc. Such a nice dinner and I'm already planning a menu for my next visit. That chicken is just too damn good to not be in my life. Viva...Viva Chicken indeed!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as everyone says it is. I even tried the herbal lemonade everyone raves about. It's different and interesting. I can't wait to go back. The smell coming from the fresh cooked everything should make you want to eat there."}
{"text":"We placed an order to go last week for a work lunch.  I had previously never seen or heard of the place, but was impressed with their menu.   Their chicken is all-natural,  free range and slow roasted.  I opted for the vegetarian selection of the quinoa stuffed avocado with a side of plantains.  Wow . . . I was incredibly impressed!  You are served the largest avocado I have possibly ever seen.  Each half ifs filled with well seasoned quinoa and topped with a chipotle ranch/balsamic drizzle and served over a bed of lettuce.  Due to the size, I ate only one of the avocado halves and saved the other for a different meal.  The plantains were rich and well seared on the outside, not too dry or overcooked like they can be at many restaurants.  We had nearly a dozen different dishes between the whole group and I didn't hear a single complaint out of anyone.  I'll definitely be back to visit Viva in the future!"}
{"text":"We had the rotisserie chicken and liked the flavors! The sauces are yummy - the red one is very hot. The fried plantains are authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"It took a while to try Viva Chicken and we are glad that we finally did.  We could smell the aroma of the chicken cooking on the rotisserie as we approached the restaurant.  Nice casual decor and a great value for our dining dollar.  Another good option in a widening array of ethnic restaurants in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is a great place to stop if you are looking for a meal that leaves you full but not full of regret. The chicken has such great flavor and their sauces (my favorite is obviously the hot) add another interesting layer to it. I got the 1/4 chicken which comes with 2 sauces and 2 sides. The beans were not your standard sweet baked bean but more of a grilled flavor, if that makes sense. The plantains were like a secret dessert (hey its a side, technically) and were just tender and sweet enough. When you get the quarter chicken you can pick light or dark meat, and Jake, who got the half chicken, said next time he would just go for the light quarter since there was not a ton of extra meat on the dark section. A quarter chicken meal runs you $8, which feels super reasonable for all the food and flavors you get. I'll definitely be back to eat my way through a whole flock, one quarter at a time."}
{"text":"A friend had recently asked me to help him pick up a new bed arrangement at an apartment here in the same complex. Pretty tempted to say no, but against my better judgment I told him I would. After powering through that cluster, we swung in for a bite. 

Another precursor. Been trying to keep up a healthy diet. After eating right throughout the day, hitting the gym for an hour, then helping my buddy out, the last thing I wanted to do was roll to a fast food joint at 8p and undo everything I did that day. So stopping in at Viva was a great choice considering. I ordered \"The Great\" wrap with some green beans as a side. The meal was pretty damn good to say the least. Definitely a healthy option without lack of flavor and satisfaction like similar dishes elsewhere.

So if you haven't figured it out already, this place mainly serves dishes with some form of chicken and \"healthier\" ingredients. From what I've noticed simply by means of food watching, I was generally impressed. Most dishes served here are very well put together and look delish.

Another item which I tried and would like to highlight is their Herbal Lemonade. Let me just rave about this a minute. Absolutely. Fantastic. Recipe. I have never had anything so refreshing. A little on the sweet side for me, but after adding a little water and ice from their fountain I was able to get what I wanted out of it. This is a must try here!

The service for this location was absolutely great- very attentive. Great modern atmosphere and décor. Not crowded- at least for 8p anyway. 

Word on the street is they are planning to open a Huntersville location- close to me- can't wait!"}
{"text":"There has been a lot of buzz going around over the opening of this chain fast food restaurant in Concord!  Concord has limited cuisine choices so the addition of a Peruvian restaurant is awesome!

So...love love love the pollo ala brasa!  Got a quarter chicken, perfectly cooked, seasoned, and super juicy!  And the Sauces are excellent!!

We had a choice of sides and we got the cilantro rice and sweet potato fries which were very good. They did not have the yuca available. 

Now, we also ordered the quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken, kale salad with pulled chicken and a chicken wrap.  Out of the three I liked the chicken wrap the best. The chicken on the salad was dry and the Chicken on the avocado had a mayo sweet sauce that did not compliment it well. (My opinion, my friend thought it was good)

I would definitely go back but I would stick to what they do best the pollo Ala brasa. Don't deviate!"}
{"text":"Very good quality and healthy meals. I would have given 5 stars but I typically get take out and there seems to be a language barrier with recording a name and repeating it back.  I often waited 5 to 10 minutes longer waiting for my order because they entered it incorrectly. Incorrectly by missing the first letter. Give them Darin and they start calling out Merriam... Huh? Oh well, food is great! Just need better English speaking employees working the register."}
{"text":"The ingredients were very fresh and the portions large. Tres leches was on point. I especially enjoyed the fresh made sangria. What topped the meal was the service. Everyone was very friendly and attention despite it being a self serve restaurant. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So after a follow up visit about a month ago. This has quickly become my favorite lunch spot. My first visit I ordered the Arroz chaufa with pulled chicken. I didn't think the chicken had much flavor. Now, my second visit I actually ordered the rotisserie chicken. Wow!! It is GREAT! The seasoning is A1 and about the best I have ever tasted!!! The side dishes are all equally awesome. I only had two very small issues: an order of Churros is actually just a (single) Churro for $2.50  and there is way too much \"stuff\" at the registers."}
{"text":"This Viva Chicken location is everything I liked about the Elizabeth location with the bonus of being walking distance to my house! Being a Peruvian rotisserie chicken joint, expect very flavorful roasted chicken, colorful dipping sauces, and a laid back atmosphere.

Upon my most recent trip here, my wife and I split a half roasted chicken which comes with 2 sides. We ended up getting sweet potato fries and chicken soup. If you are a fan of any soup, I recommend this one as a side. It's broth based, but they don't kill it with salt and load it down with huge chunks of chicken, rice, vegetables, and cilantro. A must have if I get sick this winter! Also the chicken is a can't miss. Don't forget to get the dipping sauces located in the back of the restaurant. I recommend the yellow (tangy) and red (spicy). 

I also like the new layout of the place. Glad they could carry over the patio vibe from the Elizabeth location. Overall a solid meal at a reasonable price. Makes for good eats after a few cervezas at Brawley's. You can probably catch me again here sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Really good food. First time having Peruvian cuisine and it didn't disappoint. Food was fresh, fast and affordable. Highly recommend for a quick lunch or even dinner!"}
{"text":"What to get: quarter chicken, cilantro-infused rice
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: fast casual
Wait: 3 mins (Friday 4:30PM for 1)
Parking: parking lot across the street

The Experience:
One of the best places I got to eat while visiting Charlotte. 

Parking is free and right across the street. You order at the counter and although there is a line, it moves extremely fast. I wasn't even ready when I was called up to order. Generally very clean space with two rooms to sit and eat in.

I tried the quinoa-stuffed avocado first. There were a lot of ingredients on top of both the quinoa and the avocado that I didn't really see either until I started eating. Not quite what I expected, but I loved having so much avocado at once. It's interesting to try, but I think one time is enough.

For my meal, I had a quarter chicken, cilantro-infused rice, and plantains. The chicken was juicy, tender, and flavorful. I also appreciated that it was dark meat. I was surprised by the cilantro-infused rice since I've seen other versions make the rice green, but this was more of a stir-fry with carrots and peas. I also love plantains, so you can't go wrong with those.  I ate this so fast and finished it all, which is unlike me. I honestly could have this multiple times a week and not get bored with it. I secretly wish I could get a slighter larger servings for the sides to fill the plate more, but I'm thankful for the pricing I got for the meal.

Highly recommend frequenting Viva Chicken if you're in town."}
{"text":"I felt guilty for coming here because I am loyal to another local Peruvian chicken place. Just had to get that off of my chest.

But this is more of a California type of fresh rather than a homey, hole in the wall type of restaurant. So actually, it is completely different from Pio Pio.

I had the aptly named, \"The Great\" sandwich and it was amazing and incredibly well priced. 

The service was super friendly and the atmosphere matched the bright, fresh flavors of the food.

It is a winner for all these reasons and because it is a few blocks from my house.

Glad to see this place open because this unit has been cursed.. even Starbucks closed here.. They are here to stay."}
{"text":"great food great service. get the stuffed avocado with chx. I come here everytime im in charlotte for good reason.                  ."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here on a Thursday night to break up the monotony of the week. Judging by the volume of people in the restaurant, it appears we were not the only ones who had this in mind! The takeaway is simple open-pit concept cooking that creates savory meals at a decent price.

When we walked in we were greeted by a wonderful aroma and the view of a 6' long rotisserie fire pit working it's magic on what was soon to become my next meal. I ordered the 1/4 chicken with a side of chicken soup and my wife ordered a quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection. Both my main and side dish were very simple, but packed a ton of flavor. My wife's dish had a few more ingredients, and packed even more flavor. Whatever you do, don't forget to grab the sauce. Even if you have a thing against condiments (it's OK, I will only judge you a little bit), this will take your meal to the next level. I recommend getting all three sauces as each has it's own unique flavor. 

I see the appeal of having this as a grab-and-go lunch place, but they do have a fair amount of indoor and patio seating so don't be afraid to eat in. I enjoyed both the concept and the resulting meal, and based on the menu, I can't see you going wrong with any of the choices. I definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I have been to every location in town with the exception of Huntersville and the quality here is consistent with all of the other locations, which is something many other restaurants struggle with. Viva Chicken is one of those places you eat at and you don't feel crappy after! The freshness is evident and I would say most, if not all, of their menu items can appeal to someone who is health conscious or has food allergies. I am super stoked to have another Viva Chicken in the area--awesome work and awesome concept!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken never fails to please me. Their chicken is delicious, my favorite has to be the Arroz Chaufa meal. Their dressings are amazing and the fries are my favorite. I always come here when I don't want to feel guilty about eating a lot! They have so many good salads, Quinoa stuffed avocado, getting hungry just thinking about it. 
If you are ever near here, make sure you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Love it, worth every penny, though I believe this is a little closer to two dollar signs if you consider what they offer. The ambience is more like a one dollar sign place though."}
{"text":"Run, dont walk to this place!  The chicken, the sides, the sauces, the sangria, the arroz chaufa were all fabulous.  Walked over here from the hospital across the street and so glad we did.  The grilled Peruvian chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly, so tender.  The green beans were seriously perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The yucca, the plantains...yes, please.  And dont leave without trying the arroz chaufa...a fusion style fried rice...OMG!  The sangria was exactly to my liking, not uber sweet, nice and cold with lots of fruit chunks.  If i lived here, i would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"You can't not love this place! Tons of options including my faves the great wrap, arroz chaufa and quinoa stuffed avocado! Plus they make there own sauces fresh each day!"}
{"text":"The quinoa avocado bowl with pulled chicken was amazing! I can't wait to return to order the same thing. The limeade was pretty good as well, so refreshing. The customer service was top notch. Everyone was super friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"The chicken was sublime. Rice was a little dry but good taste. The sauces were yummy and service fast."}
{"text":"What a unique restaurant with so much vegetarian options....

My colleague ordered the avacado appetizer which both looked and tasted delicious.... I had the noodles which were good and especially the green chutney they give along is awesome....
The bean soup is also very good and the juices are great too..... 
Keep coming back at least once a week for lunch!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious EVERY time! The sauces are amazing. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I recommend the Arroz Chaufa, The great with Chicken and their fries are so crunchy and yummy. mmm"}
{"text":"Was in town for business and went there after reading reviews on yelp and it didn't disappoint. The chicken was fantastic and the sauces were great! I loved it so much that I went back the next night! I need them to come to Texas! :)"}
{"text":"A unique concept we don't have in Cincinnati - the other Queen City. A chicken and sides easily feeds at least 4 adults and a few kids. Fairly healthy and fun variety. Love the salad with chickpeas and plantains the best!"}
{"text":"Peruvian cuisine at a convenience. You can order anything from a quarter chicken - full chicken, salad, chicken stuffed avocados, wraps, plantains, rice, etc! I really enjoy their wraps and the stuffed avocados the best. I find that this place is much better as a lunch spot than a dinner spot because of their casual atmosphere. They turn food around quickly and have friends and accommodating wait staff. You order at the register and they will deliver to your table.

{"text":"We love the chicken as well as everything else this is Purvian food and very authentic.  Wish they would branch out. It would be a big hit in Az"}
{"text":"Chicken is awesome here!  So are all the sides.  We usually get the family meal and I eat all 3 of the sauces.  Nice kick with the red and green sauce.  Been here several times, always great!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots in the Charlotte area.  Viva works well as both a sit-down restaurant and as a take-out spot.  

I have been here twice and ordered the Wow Lomito each time.  WOW is right! This twist on the steak sandwich works well on many levels.  The ciabatta bread is soft and warm (wouldn't work the same if it was cold and/or hard).  The steak has a wonderful, light, grilled smoky flavor to it and the onions and tomato are the perfect complement.  You can't forget to add cheese and avocado as well!  We're talking down right, good food y'all!

My roommate is fond of ordering the 1/2 chicken with two sides for $11.50.  I've tasted it several times and I can also give this menu item my certified stamped of approval.  You can't believe how tasty this all-natural, free range, rotisserie chicken is.  This isn't what you pick-up at the Teeter or Food Lion.   You can tell a lot of love and time has been put into each chicken they serve.   

It is a welcomed addition to the Elizabeth area of Charlotte.  I plan to continue to patronize Viva and hope to continue to explore this vast and unique menu."}
{"text":"Greatly favored chicken, healthy portion size just wish the pricing was more economical."}
{"text":"Quinoa stuffed avocado is AMAZING!  Staff is very friendly and personable!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty busy, but service is decently fast. BOMB food."}
{"text":"Food is good. But do not order delivery. They short change you on condiments (sauce)- which is crucial for flavors. For a whole rotisserie chicken, they will give only 2-3 oz sauce. So you will be effectively eating roasted bland chicken"}
{"text":"Delicious food but disappointed they have NO nutritional information. When you have special diet restrictions it's helpful to know nutritional info. Also, NO WiFi"}
{"text":"TAKE THOSE 5 STARS, TAKE THEM ALL!

This business is genius. 1. the food is TASTY and not super heavy on the stomach. They have healthier options and also more hearty ones. Food comes out warm, the service is generally friendly. Very casual environment. 

They have high chairs for the little ones and also they serve food for the kiddies too. They also sell beers so this place works to bring the whole family. Again, it's very casual and laid back.... you have to order your food at the counter but I will absolutely be returning to Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"Best chicken ever. 

Not dry at all, cooked perfectly with great seasonings. The yellow sauce was my favorite. The plantains and green beans were really good too. 

Highly recommend the quinoa stuffed avocado (I added pulled chicken to mine) and whatever the green colored tea is 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is always pretty busy, but I came here last night (Friday) and they were SLAMMED. Regardless.....the line moved super quick, I received my food fast, and it was just as delicious as always. I got the Naked Peruvian with added chicken again, but this time on a wrap instead of ciabatta roll - Yum. Yum.  I've promised myself to try something new next time, but this place is so good I'm honestly not worried about what to choose."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I am impressed with how good the food is!! Always consistent, friendly, and clean. I used to travel like 30 mins to a Viva towards the South end because its such quality food, but so thankful there is a closer location now!! I will always recommend Viva to people!"}
{"text":"YAY for Viva Chicken!

Viva Chicken opened fairly recently in the Shops at Toringdon off of Johnston Road.  It's a great looking and modern restaurant specializing in Peruvian rotisserie chicken, also known as Pollo a la Brasa. Any my oh my, is it good!

My hubby and I visited on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and while it was busy, the experience was smooth and the service was super attentive.

We shared an appetizer - the quinoa stuffed avocado - it definitely could've passed for an entree.  It was awesome - fresh and savory.  My husband had the chicken soup and it was amazing.  I had a 1/4 chicken with yucca fries and the chicken was so flavorful - the 24 hour marinate was really apparent and the yucca fries was a welcome change to the ordinary potato. We also shared the Pumpkin cheesecake - a perfect ending to an amazing lunch.  

We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I always make it a point to stop by Viva Chicken when I'm in Charlotte! Tasty, quick, cheap, and possibly even healthy - VC has everything I look for in a restaurant. 

Starting with the slow-roasted rotisserie chicken: a quick trip to the heart of Flavortown. It's so simple, yet soooooooo delicious. Easily the best Peruvian chicken I've ever had (also the only I've ever had). Viva's sauces are great, but not even necessary as the chicken itself packs a serious punch. 

The sides held their own as well. I'm not a huge green bean guy, but really enjoyed these. Pretty standard sweet potato fries (not at all an insult), and cilantro infused rice was well flavored and far from bland."}
{"text":"I am glad they opened this location closer to my house. Best rotisserie chicken in the area and i love their yuca fries and their sauces (especially the green sauce). Great service too."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is healthy and good.  Really like the mint drinks.  Great variety.  Another new favorite of mine.  :)"}
{"text":"This is what the food will be like in heaven. Yelp wants me to make this review longer, but that's all you need to know. The plantains, sweet potato fries, sauces, and EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE MENU is just s'good."}
{"text":"I went on a business meal for lunch around noon and it was busy and relatively loud. Didn't have to wait long and food came quickly. One of the best Viva Chicken locations!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!! My second time here. Smells amazing as soon as you walk through the door. The last time I ordered the classic saltado and it was amazing. It had so much steak and was really filling. This time I've ordered the quinoa stuffed avocado. Also amazing, added chicken. Don't forget to ask for their sauces. Try them all"}
{"text":"When I moved to Charlotte I found it strange that this place showed up so high on yelp and trip advisor but after eating there once, and then 30 other times, I totally get it. It's so amazing. This is the only Peruvian food I've had and I love it. I get the 1/4 chicken with double cilantro rice. Their sauces are what really get me. I prefer to douse everything in the yellow sauce. It's incredible. I find myself taking an extra home to put on a sale or bed of rice. It's usually busy but quick and you can always order online. There's a parking lot across the street with free parking at the Elizabeth location."}
{"text":"My first thought when eating this food was how did I not know about this place ! The chicken is delicious and the rice and sides (veggies) were too ! The portions were generous and the cost was affordable! 
No complaints .... just delicious chicken! 
Don't miss this one !"}
{"text":"I was dragged here by my sister for lunch one day. I wasn't really expecting much, so I was very pleased with my meal. First of all, the place was packed. Every table seemed to be taken. That was definitely a good sign. 

I ordered \"The Great\" sandwich, which had pulled chicken, onion, lettuce, and tomato, and a side of cilantro rice. The sandwich lived up to its name. The chicken was moist and the veggies were fresh. I didn't branch out to try the sauces they had, but I'll be sure to try them next time. The rice wasn't my favorite, but I tend to be fairly picky about everything I eat. 

We were able to grab a table outside in the covered patio area, but after we took our seat, there was no other table left for the people who came in after us. Lucky for us, unlucky for them."}
{"text":"Love....love.....love this place and am so glad we have one in Concord now.  The food is always amazing and the wait is not bad at all.  My husband and I frequent this location now since it is closer to our home but we love the fact that the food is fresh and healthy as well as filling.  Staff is always friendly and helpful when trying to decide On Their amazing menu....Arroz Chaufa is my favorite dish to get with the sweet plaintains as well as the yucca."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! Must go!!! Delicious food, relaxed atmosphere,  low prices,  and great service.   The green beans were AMAZING."}
{"text":"Today I called the Elizabeth Ave location to place a pick up order. I ordered 1/4 chicken and 2 sides and requested that the chicken be pulled because they have done this in the past. The girl informed me that they do usually chop the white chicken and I said that is fine, I just didn't want it on the bone. I go to pick up my order and the person who grabs my bag with the food in it comes over to the other 2 cashiers and says \"Uh, we aren't allowed to do this anymore. We can't request pulled chicken. Whoever did this you can't do that, that's wrong and you shouldn't have done that.\" The girl ringing me up said \"well it wasn't me!\" and the other girl glances at me and snarkily says \"well, she insisted.\" It was unacceptable for the one person to scold workers in front of a customer and the fact that the cashier lied and said I insisted it be pulled was so rude! I couldn't believe the unprofessionalism from a place that is typically so great - at least the Ballantyne location is. Very dissatisfied with the service today.

Of course, the food is amazing! Just wish the service matched."}
{"text":"Delicious. Every time my mom is in town this is the first place she wants to go. Love the arroz chaufa or the stuffed avocado. Major thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Viva Chicken, welcome to one of my top ten favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Viva Chicken in the Ballantyne area is the type of place you go to for Peruvian soul food and I don't say that lightly. My family and I have been going here for over a year and one thing that I can say for certain is Viva Chicken has never once let us down, the meals have always been consistently hot, fresh, delicious and addicting. You just can't wait to come back.

I found out about this place just driving through Ballantyne and if you're familiar with Ballantyne then you know there are many restaurants to pick from. But, I was in the mood for something like a healthy alternative to burgers, pizza and Indian food, so I checked out Yelp, big shout out and found the best reviewed places in the area. Viva Chicken was one of those places and I stopped in.

The customer service is top notch, if there are any problems whatsoever, it's handled quickly and with a smile, the restaurant is always clean and neat; the condiments and utensils are always filled. When you walk in, you're instantly greeted with the aroma of slow cooked Peruvian style chicken, the decor is simple and warm, the seating could be better because depending on the time you come, you may not have a decent seat. 

But let's get to the food, I usually order the half chicken with sweet potato fries and solterito. No matter how many times I've had this dish, it's always been delicious. Viva Chicken also has  salads and sandwich wraps but I've yet to venture there yet!! Regardless of what you order, you will be pleased. For the the price and quality of food, Viva Chicken is hard to beat. Check them out when in the area and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The quinoa stuffed avocado with pulled chicken is to die for!  The service is great-take out or dine on. The yuca, plantains and jasmine rice, all good!"}
{"text":"I went to Viva Chicken with my family for lunch after hearing it was delicious from a coworker of mine. It did not disappoint! The prices may seem high, but after having a taste and seeing the fair portions you will want to come back. My 1/4 piece of dark meat chicken was well seasoned and so tender. I had a side of fresh fruit and something else, I forgot the name. All of it was very tasty and the service was quick, even when it was busy. 
I wish to see more Viva Chickens close to me in SC, it's a great business."}
{"text":"For a while we were getting take out from here 2-3 days a week. It's so good! Always get the stuff avocado appetizer. Huge portions too."}
{"text":"Just newly opened in Waverly this Viva Chicken location does not disappoint! The dinning room and patio offer lots of seating.... But seriously you came here to eat that delicious chicken.   

Like the other locations the menu is the same and all the sauces are there should you decide to need them. The chicken is delicious and the rice - both jasmine and cilantro infused are both yummy. 

The new Waverly location is noisy . The background music is loud and the ceilings are high which adds even more noise than you'd expect .  

Great food - excellent service !
Way to go Viva Chicken !"}
{"text":"One of the few Charlotte restaurants in my weekly rotation. The full chicken meal with two family style sides is one of the best values in Charlotte to feed a group. 
Don't miss out on the stuffed avocados. Also well known as some of the best french fries in charlotte. #teamyellowsauce"}
{"text":"Just open Viva's door and get ready for the friendly assault of the scent of rotisserie chicken. Look the menu over, and know that whatever choice you make, it will be the right one."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service as always!
Tried their alfajores cookies today and the tres leches cake ! 
The alfajores cookie is good, it has a dulce de leche filling, the cookie is crumbly and has a toffee taste. I would rate it a 3/5.
The tres leches cake however is amazing, it's sweet ,creamy and moist, it tastes like heaven ! It's so good,OMG! I could not get enough of it ! 

Viva Chicken is the best!!!!"}
{"text":"After relocating from the Raleigh/Durham area, we were looking for somewhere comparable to Alpaca. Viva Chicken exceeded our expectations. The staff were very helpful and knowledgeable and the service was fast! The chicken....awesome and so are all of the sides. I can't wait to try the stuffed avocado next time. We could eat here several times a week! It's just that good."}
{"text":"Sides are okay but the chicken is a ripoff. Another case of trendy crap. Many better options for less. Everything here is too salty. Salt is not a spice. Not worth the price or the wait."}
{"text":"It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to good fresh clean healthy food. This place has it all. Eating healthy is extremely important to me. I ordered a chicken bowl with flavored Ice tea. When the food came it looked amazing. A Big portion, fresh everything
 The tea was infused and tasted better than any tea I have ever had. Not sugary.
I eat a lot but was almost un able to finish the whole bowl. Definitely enough for 2, or bring home the rest for later. The staff were verry friendly answering questions. The server who brought my food over explained to me the 3 different sauces. This place is very clean and we'll run. Busy but with a flow that keeps things moving.
5+  stars from me Viva Chicken."}
{"text":"Wow,  everything was so good!  We need this in Atlanta.

All of the dishes had lots of flavor,  from the chicken to the quinoa and veggies.   I'm going to have to take some home with me."}
{"text":"Pretty good rotisserie chicken. I like that they have the sauces out for your choosing. 

 I really like the lomo saltado (beef) sandwich. 

The yuca fries are tasty. 

The tres leches and alfajores are both a nice sweet dessert.

However, it seems like the fast food of Peruvian cuisine.

They're are better and more authentic places near Charlotte for that experience.

{"text":"I have gotten several things from viva chicken and finally decided after getting the soap de polo yesterday I will not be back. I was given a container of broth and another container of rice with various raw vegetables.  If I wanted to make my own soup I could have done so at home. For almost $7 , this was a mess. I took the \"soup\" back and got my money back. This place is always packed and reviews are great, I just don't see what others are seeing. My coworker's chicken was way undercooked. It ended up in the trash.  NO VIVA CHICKEN for our lunch break."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the chicken is always delicious and for sides get the cilantro lime rice and the french fries you will not be disappointed.  Make sure you have time to wait because it is always packed for good reason"}
{"text":"Viva chicken has the most unique and great tasting food hands down. I always get the arroz chaufa, which is basically fried rice, scallions, red peppers and some other veggies, and I choose to add chicken for a small upcharge. It's wonderful, I order it every time and I don't think I could ever get tired of it. I've been to a few of their locations and each time it's been really busy and kind of chaotic with a long line to order at the register and everyone trying to get their own drinks and grab some sauces and napkins, etc and it can be hard to find a table at times. so I would recommend getting a to go order to avoid all the craziness, but the food wont disappoint!"}
{"text":"Lunch can get busy so order ahead and pick it up. Must gets are yuca fries and plantains. The sauces are a perfect compliment to the food. The green sauce is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Run, don't walk. I was dreaming of my next visit while still sitting at the restaurant.  My first time eating Peruvian food and I loved it.  Split the whole chicken, cilantro rice, green beans, and sweet potato fries.  Unbelievable how good it was."}
{"text":"Oh em gee!! Try the quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken! Explosion of flavors!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently great. There's a rare occasion of hard rice in the arroz chaufa but the chicken veg and salads are always delicious. I also like their sangria and the maracuya."}
{"text":"I live a few blocks from viva chicken so I decided to check it out. I ordered the quarter chicken with two sides and a drink. The chicken was falling off the bone and very tasty. I got a side salad which was awesome (the balsamic dressing is amazing) and the white rice. They have a cilantro infused rice that I heard others order  but I am not a cilantro fan.  

What made this place stand out the best is the service. I was thrown off a little at first because when you order you walk up to a counter and get a number and sit down, food is delivered and that's it. Not here the staff regularly walks around offering to refill drinks, get you a spoon and take your plate when you are finished. I also like the fact that most their paper and plastic products are recycled or are compostable. 

All in all I think Viva Chicken is a great place for a quick healthy meal, awesome staff and earth friendly."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD. Extremely fresh, tasty and amazing service. 

Must try the veggie food, it's soo good. 

The juices are extremely refreshing and their tres leches cake, to die for!"}
{"text":"When my friends made recommendations for dinner, one of them was Peruvian chicken at Viva Chicken.  When I heard this, of course I exclaimed that was my choice... No one cooks rotisserie chicken like Peruvians do!

I was very impressed with the portion size and quality of the food. My half chicken with was cooked and seasoned perfectly with sides of fried yucca and green beans.  All were very good, but perhaps a little salty.  Make sure that you save room for dessert... Some of the best tres leches cake I have ever tasted!  

And best of all, it is super cheap! I got a half chicken, two sides, a bottle of water, and a huge piece of tres leches cake for just about $20 with tax.

I like that the place was very casual, but there is not much ambience. We did sit outside in the covered area, but it was not super special."}
{"text":"Authentic, great staff, good is so delish!"}
{"text":"Im a fan of peruvian food (must be bc its the best food in the whole world, and bc im peruvian haha) I was so excited to go to Viva chicken since its closer to uptown and I dont have to drive all the way to pineville. It did not dissapoint me at all. The chicken is great and my ultra favorite yuccas still taste amazing. I loved the avocados with quinoa (you have to try it) and the alfajores are to die for :)
Overall the place is great, not too big and a sort of deli look. I wish they did make more entrees but I guess they wanted to keep it simple and classy. Great job :)"}
{"text":"I was not sold on my first experience in Huntersville, but the Concord location despite being very busy is rocking!  The avocado quinoa bowl with pulled chicken was huge with a whole avocado split and stuffed with quinoa and chicken, a great option for health conscious diners.  Also tried the half chicken with sides and of course the sauce (yellow is best).  Don't forget the limeade with basil or other fruit drinks all are great."}
{"text":"love viva chicken! Great variety of food that won't make you feel super guilty after. The sauce bar is the key to life! Drinks are great."}
{"text":"This location has only been open for a couple of weeks, but it is amazing. The staff was friendly and helpful, the wait was very short and the food was delicious. I ordered The Great in a sun-dried tomato wrap with avocado and cheese added and a side of plantains. The wrap was packed full and did not disappoint. So happy to have this wonderful food option nearby!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed our lunch at Viva Chicken.  There are many different flavors of sauces to chose from with your food, and the rice is good too! Yes, you can get Chicken from Boston Market, but the Chicken at at Viva is all natural free range Chicken.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, I love this place. I'm disappointed in myself for not checking it out sooner. I am a fan of their quinoa stuffed avocado, as everyone seems to be, and will be back for more. I love the decor and the outside space, although it's clear this place could be twice the size and still be packed. I also very much enjoyed their Tallarin Saltado, which is like an Asian version of Linguine. Can't wait to come back and try their chicken!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite eating joint. I like their french fries and sauces. The people at cash counter needs little more customer service training"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! The food is always on point and the service is great! It's a good bang for your buck. Especially because the portions are just the right size! If I could go everyday I definitely would!"}
{"text":"We stayed at a hotel close by and walked over for lunch. We both had wraps and loved them. I had the Inca without chicken and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the Great - he really enjoyed it. I had a bite of his just so I could try the chicken and it was probably the best rotisserie I've tasted. Wish I was here longer to try more!!"}
{"text":"Diana and the catering team provided excellent service for a recent order we placed at my work! Diana even went the extra mile and drove out to our office to drop off extra sauce that we requested and wasn't included when I went to pick up our order. It was very reassuring to see exceptional customer service from Diana! We will definitely use Viva Chicken catering for future needs."}
{"text":"I'm happy Viva came to my neighborhood; I'm a huge fan of all things slowly roasting on a spit.  Our visit was as expected:  seemless service, prompt delivery, and good quality.  We sat out on the patio and didn't feel abandoned wayyy out there.

I'm going to upset some of my Yelp buddies, but I think they have good chicken for a franchise, but not great  (OK, go ahead and stop following me and take me off your friends list).  My wife disagrees, too!  I expect all this from a company with multiple locations.

I still think, however, that for all their quirks, both the Roasting Company and Pio Pio have a wonderful participation in the rotisserie chicken space, too.  Now I have three within 5 minutes of my home.  Welcome, Viva!"}
{"text":"Okay I'm a little annoyed cuz I got charged $6.50 for the Inca Wrap when it clearly says $6 for the wrap. Yea... I count my pennies. I'm on a budget. 

Other than that, the wrap is really good. Especially when you get an extra green sauce, and pour that sucker in there. Uh! Like love in my mouth. 

The fries are okay. I like them a little thick. Definitely not good reheated. 

I'll keep going because I get a discount. That definitely makes coming back a little sweeter."}
{"text":"It's the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado with chicken for sure!  My first visit I chose \"The Great\" sandwich and it was really good, but when I saw my wife's stuffed avocado, I HAD to try it, so we went back last weekend.  I wasn't disappointed!  And if you're not limiting sugar intake, try the Tres Leches for desert --- never had anything like it!"}
{"text":"When you come, order the stuffed avocado with shredded chicken. This restaurant is absolutely amazing and their food is all natural, organic choices. Every time I visit Charlotte, I make it a point to stop at ViVa Chicken."}
{"text":"Great Service and Excellent Food. Salads are full of flavor and the sauces are great too! This is definitely on the rotation now of places we frequent!"}
{"text":"Always consistent! It's a chain I know but it's still so good. New spot in Waverly. Parking sucks in the Plaza but there's a lot of restaurants so it is to be expected"}
{"text":"Great location, great building. The food was good, but personally, I'm not sure it would have been worth it had I not been with my family, only because of the ridiculous line we waited in in order to order. (Excuse that awkward wording). The place was tremendously crowded and loud as well. That being said, the food was very good and it definitely has something that no one else in the area has, in terms of food and even ambiance."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The menu is advertised as Peruvian food. Fried plantains, cilantro and jasmine rice, yucca, and chicken are all staples. 

In a group of 3, we all enjoyed our dishes. Two of us had the chicken combo with two sides. The other one of us ordered the tako plate. There was nothing left behind."}
{"text":"Really good fast casual. Fresh ingredients and delicious healthy options can be found here. 
For my first time I wasn't sure what to expect, there is a line and a chalkboard style menu on the wall. The girl at the counter was a little impatient. So maybe check out the menu  and have an idea of what you like before you go. 
I had the viva salad and my husband had a taco bowl. Both very good.  Two Birdsong jalapeño IPAs to round out the meal.  Also couldn't resist a slice of tres leches. Very sweet and rich, enough to share. 
Great prices for the quality of food. 
Beautiful modern decor inside and a great patio. No music playing while we dined which seemed strange. I will definitely be back to try a rotisserie chicken, or maybe get it to go."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken - what an excellent find in Charlotte! I have ordered the Viva Chicken Salad, which is delicious and flavorful, topped with their amazing rotisserie chicken, veggies, feta cheese, and several hearty slices of avocado. I have also had their whole rotisserie chicken with three sides - amazing deal to feed several people for only $22! The chicken was full of flavor and very tender, and I enjoyed all three sauces it came with (especially the aji amarillo sauce). You can't go wrong with their cilantro infused rice and canary beans, which go excellently with the chicken, but the star of the show is their sweet plantains. Amazing taste, perfectly fried and ripe. I'm anxious to try their other offerings at some point too!"}
{"text":"Daniel the Shift leader was very professional, he made me feel very welcomed, I will defiantly come here more often, Viva Chicken is one of the best restaurants in Charlotte!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Last summer when I was here, I kept hearing about all of the hype at this place. My job ordered it in one day. And although it was good, I was completely going crazy. BUT...this time, I was indeed! My mom was in town this weekend so I wanted to take her to a place true to Charlotte and I'm a cool area, so we went to the original location. At first we were overwhelmed by the amount of options. One of the employees behind the register realized and literally came around to point out each thing to us, explain each dish, talk about her favorites, and say all of the different options that we had. Just her enthusiasm for her job and the stuff that they make made us excited and ready to eat everything. My mom and I ended up sharing the stuffed avocado salad and then got a quarter chicken with two sides. One was this cold salad type dish with corn, edamame, and a few other things. My mom absolutely loved it! And then I chose to get yuks, which I only had one other time at a Cuban restaurant. We dipped that and the chicken in their mild sauce, which deserves a moment of silence, it was so good. I also tried one of their houses made juices, which tasted just like Christmas. Everyone around us seemed to be eating the fried rice, so I definitely have to get that next time."}
{"text":"Even for pescatarians this place is heaven sent. The Peruvian fried rice with avocado all the way to the yuca(which I'm a sucker for) to even their flavorful drink selection. I'm all for recommending this place to anyone never disappoints"}
{"text":"I like the food here but the service could be better. Last time i ordered to go i felt like i just got ripped off. I had arroz chaufa that was half full and the inca wrap was so small it looked like a taco. Which was completely not the usual servings. I called to let the mgr know my disappointments but he completely disregarded it...and just to quickly get me off the phone he promised to send me vouchers by post mail....it's been 3 weeks still waiting...lol!"}
{"text":"Absolutely obsessed with this place. I heard a few people talking about it and decided to try it. So glad I did! I ate their 3 times in the first week :) The green sauce is amazing, and the chicken is so flavorful and tender! Yum!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The food is yummy and fresh.  I definitely recommend they stuffed avocado and sweet potato fries. Make sure you try all of the dipping sauces!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place when we want a peruvian chicken fix. The chicken is awesome. Fried yucca - great. Sweet potato fries - really great. Even the regular fries are very very good. Last time I went, I had the taco bowl (Viva Tacu Bowl) and it was fantastic. My only complaint is that they went waaaaaaay craaaaaazy with the red onions on top. It was a mountain. But after removing about 70% percent of them, I dug right in ;)"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of Peruvian food but my work ordered it for us for lunch. I LOVED IT! I'll be by for more this weekend!"}
{"text":"As a peruvian myself, I know that Viva Chicken serves authentic, amazing peruvian food! The classic saltado was just like my grandmother makes and the stuffed avocados were so delicious. The staff was super friendly. I can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"owner got in contact and was super nice and understanding and rectified the mistake. I'm back to being a regular customer and highly recommend the viva!"}
{"text":"I ate here after a convention at the Grady Cole Center. My quarter chicken with plantains and solterito was reasonably priced, filling, and interesting. This place obviously caters mostly to non-Peruvians, but the flavors seem to be traditionally Peruvian, rather than being toned down to suit American tastes. If I was in this area more often, I'd eat here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Weekday lunches, this is a packed place with a long line. You stand in line, order, and they bring the food to your table. This is that type of place.

The lunch crowd fueled by its proximity to the Paul Mitchell School, CPCC, the hospitals and numerous medical offices. Enjoyable, positive vibe inside the place. 

Parking is questionable. No signs were visible as to the best place to park. Street parking (coin slot M-F) is there, and a few lots. 

Having visited Peru twice, I wondered if any Peruvians would actually work there. This was answered quickly. I asked the cashier if he was Peruvian - he was. He gave me a recommendation: Quinoa-stuffed avocado with pulled chicken added.

And I was pleased to see Inca Kola available at the counter. Inca Kola is a yellow Peruvian soda tasting like cream soda which was safe to drink in Peru, and was a familiar sight anytime I sat down to eat in Peru. This soda isn't particularly wonderful. It's just that I'm a sentimental person.

I enjoyed the dish. And I was so proud at how healthy I was eating. \"Super food\" avocado plus the popular-as-ever quinoa, known for its healing powers and for empowering supernatural abilities in those who eat it. It's a good lunch. It works.

The dish included two stuffed avocados, but I was satisfied eating only one.

Cost...I don't know how to compare their prices, since I know of no such menu around town. Seemed slightly more expensive than it needs to be."}
{"text":"Clean, nice interior,  well staffed with nice people, environmentally friendly, heat lamps on the patio, and the food is delicious. My causa from last night made a great breakfast today. Oh, and the herbal lemonade is sooo good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For what it is - a mini-chain, QSR Peruvian chicken place - this place knocks it out of the park. We got:

* Whole chicken, perfectly roasted (and not dry)
* Canary beans? They were AMAZING, and great as leftovers.
* Green beans - also great
* Good fries
* 3 sauces that were all excellent.
* A salad

This fed a family of 4, for about $36."}
{"text":"I hate to do 3 stars but I don't really have a choice.

The hype I read online for this place was unreal but I was not blown away at all. Rotisserie chicken not much different than the grocery store? Also I was meh about the sauces. I know - I'm a crazy person. I just feel that the hype led me to disappointment. The herbal limeade was way to herbal for me also. 

Maybe I will go back and try something different on the menu and be blown away. I should've tried the stuffed avocado. I am hoping I can go back and change my opinion! It just wasn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"First time, loved it. Chicken is flavorful and all the different sauces are delicious and worth trying. Saw lots of delicious looking food going by as well, will be back to try some other dishes. Had Caesar salad with chicken."}
{"text":"Peruvian sandwich without mayo and feta is sooooo great for vegans!!!! Something for everyone here."}
{"text":"This is so close to 5 stars I can't stand it. 5 is perfect and it's nearly there. If you like south American definitely give it a try. Great selection and taste of food. Not too big a menu. Beer and wine offered. Easy in and out. Great service."}
{"text":"What a refreshing, delicious meal! Efficient ordering process with a quick turn-around time to dinner service. Fear not, some of the best Peruvian food I've had! Appearances are deceptive, and it offers some of the most succulent chicken complemented by a bed of well-seasoned, cilantro-infused rice that has me wanting for more. As one who loves spice, this hits the spot. Top that of with the sweet, char-grilled plantains! What a delight.

Super affordable. Eco-friendly. Only complaint regards the often overly-eager employees that often request to dispose of plates prematurely. Still, the food has me coming back for more! 9/10!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is very good and very fresh. The people are super friendly and I love the patio."}
{"text":"We keep coming back. The food is amazing and the service is just as good. Desiree is great!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, love all the free sauces too! My favorite is the Tacu Bowl with dark meat chicken!"}
{"text":"VivaChicken is my new favorite for a quick, filling meal. Generous portions of deliciously flavored food in a relaxed casual atmosphere. 

The chicken is a bit on the dry side but the great sauces take care of that."}
{"text":"Full disclaimer:  I know the owner, Randy Garcia, so I want you to know that if I hadn't enjoyed the food, I would just not talk about it. Who wants to refer someone to a place that's bad? Not me.

A group of nine of us (all girls) went last night and it's easy to order (order at counter, self serve your drinks and sit while they prepare your food to order). 

I had this amazing Fried Rice dish with chicken. Savory, fresh and full of flavor. I also got the appetizer with fries and chozio that comes with three dipping sauces. 

I think almost everything on the menu was ordered by someone at our table and we shared our food with each other as we caught up on our lives. 

They have delivery and take-out is quick and easy, as is the parking right across the street. It's also one of those places that you can grab a quick bite to eat while your by yourself without feeling odd about dining alone. And speak of dining, the dining area is a little small, but there's a heated seating area that looked to be quite large and they welcome pets there.

I should have grabbed a menu so that I could be more intelligent about describing what we ordered, but you'll just have to take my word for it. This place is that good!"}
{"text":"Hey guys you just keeping  better and better every day we had the classic saltado  four of. Us and we love the meat was tender. Juicy. And fries still crispy kudos to Viva chicken. Will be bringing my family this weekend  I want to try arroz chaufa with beef"}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation from a friend, a few coworkers and I tried this place for lunch.  We were thoroughly impressed!  You can always tell when a restaurant is doing a solid by the amount of clientele you see, and Viva Chicken is very popular!  A little bit crowded, but the lines to order move quickly.

I ordered \"The Great\" sandwich on ciabatta, with their Peruvian rotisserie chicken, assorted salad green lettuce, tomatoes, lime-pickled onions and what they call a \"rocoto mayo\".  On the side I got an order of French fries and their \"Aly Amarillo\" sauce.  Food quality, presentation and flavors were all TOP NOTCH, I can't recommend this sandwich enough!

My associates also got their Viva Taku Bowl and the Classic Saltado.  Very good flavors and presentation, they agreed.

Atmosphere is a modern layout with rustic tinges, from the wood-bottom chairs, metal stools and antique filament incandescent lights overhead.  Clean layout, but can be a bit loud.  They also have a covered patio they enclose in colder weather.  Would be awesome on a spring/summer day for a good lunch or after 5 meal.  Several varieties of beverages including a few regional Peruvian favorites.  A few options for beer/wine as well.

We all agreed we would be back, and recommend them highly for a quick, flavorful and healthy meal."}
{"text":"Let's just say I ate a lot of peruvian food where I used to live.  When I first heard of this place I was pumped.  They have traiditional appetizers such as a huacachina which was pretty on point.  Though, this isn't really a peruvian restaurant with traidtional peruvian plates.  Its more of a sandwich shop infused with Peruvian food.  At first, i was hoping for the latter, but after I took that first bite I knew this would be one of my favorite spots.  They do use pollo al a brasa ( rotisserie) and have lomo saltado, but basically this is just a banging sandwich place.  For the price this can't be beat. Great sandwiches, great taste, and inca cola mudda trucker. 

Tip- always use the green aji sauce.  My god I wish someone would bottle this up and sell it like siracha.  I would buy a keg of it."}
{"text":"The stuffed avocados are amazing! The sauces make the meal. Chicken was a little dry but didn't bother me. Must eat here!"}
{"text":"The chicken at Viva is delicious! When my friend told me about this place she said it tasted like Boston Market, but clearly she has no taste buds. OMG viva chicken seasons their meat so well & cooks it perfectly nice & juicy. I also got the cilantro infused rice, the rice was okay for me not the best because you couldn't really taste the flavor it tasted like jasmine rice, the plantains were deliciously cooked! Perfect amount of crisp and seasoning."}
{"text":"Believe it or not this was my first time here.
The vibe is nice, decoration cool, the staff polite and attentive. 
We went to Concord mainly because I wanted to go to Nothing Bundt Cakes in a different spot that I normally go so we decided to dine in the area and my husband picked Viva Chicken since That would be my first time and because we were in kind of a rush and had no time for a sit down restaurant.
So we both went with 1/4 of chicken with two sides. I had fried yucca with chicken soup, maracuya juice and we split a churro. My husband picked green beans and cilantro infused rice for his sides. 
I was impressed how crowded the place was, the line was huge and people did not stop growing even then our food got ready so fast! I loved how they were well prepared for the rush.
My food came and it looked interesting, the chicken was falling from the bone, juice and full of flavors, the yucca was crunchy but did not taste the way I was expecting. My favorite without any doubt was the maracuya juice, even thought I do not drink industrial drinks I opened an exception for this one and it was worth it!
I did not like the soup, not because it tasted bad or anything, but there are some much raw onions and peppers on it that was hard to get them out of the way. I do enjoy onions and peppers but when they are cooked. 
I like the fact they have biodegradable plates, they looked so good that I only realized they were paper by the end of my meal. 
The churro was okay, it was bigger than I thought. My husband loved it!
He also enjoyed his meal a lot!!!
The food it self is not expensive and they serve you a pretty amount but if you add drinks and desserts it can become quite expensive for the type of food and place.
Personally I am not looking forward to go back, not because I didn't enjoy the experience or anything, it is just not my type of place. My husband loves it, my friends love it and if one day I have to back for some reason that is not my choice I would not oppose it."}
{"text":"Great quality chicken and sweet plantains! Only complaint is that some employees hover by you if you sit in the booths near the drink machines. That gets very annoying. Other than that, it's a great place!"}
{"text":"So yummy! I ordered the 1/4 chicken with quinoa and green beans. I loved the green beans and chicken but wasn't feeling the quinoa, next time I'll get the rice. Overall great experience and great food! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is a frequent meet up spot for lunch.  I get the 1/4 roasted chicken with sides because I can't get enough of the yummy sauces. The green sauce is my favorite but I like them all.  I switch up side options every time and they are all good but the green beans are exceptional.  I have never had green beans prepared that way, kind of crisp with diced red peppers and delicious seasoning.  It pairs so well with the chicken.  The cilantro rice is also a favorite.  In fact, after writing this review, I think I need to go there for lunch!  Don't sleep on this place its a gem."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place so when my aunt and grandmother were looking for lunch I suggested we try it out. The menu is straight forward and I rather liked that. I decided to get the quarter chicken with fried yuca and plantains. The chicken was delicious and I loved 2/3 of the sauces. The green \"mint\" sauce was okay but I personally think the other two are much better! The yuca was yummy and the plantains were really thickly cut. My aunt got the same thing I did and my grandmother got a salad. Everyone enjoyed their meals! All in all the portion size was very filling and I would absolutely come back again in the future, but most likely for take out! The only downside in my opinion, and the reason for preferring take out is it's VERY loud. The music was up too high so everyone had to talk over it making the noise levels too much for me."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite places around town to eat. Food is always amazing and the experience is good as well. Highly recommended for a great place for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Despite this place being called Viva CHICKEN, there are a handful of awesome vegetarian options. The Naked Peruvian is my favorite wrap and you can't go wrong with any of the three lemonade / tea options. The plantains are a delicious side and both the alfajores and churros make for a delicious dessert. 

Service is quick and despite this being a \"fast\" food type restaurant, there are still employees walking around, refilling your drink, etc. 

Nothing bad to say here! Viva is great!!"}
{"text":"This location seems larger than Elizabeth.  It seems a little cramped towards the back seating. The patio was tolerable on one of those hot, hot Charlotte July summer days.  Had the Arroz Chaufa w/steak.  Always a fan!  One of my Peruvian favorites yucca.  Get that every time.  Viva Chicken is great for a wonderful tasty meal that is quick & healthy."}
{"text":"The Saltado is the bomb.  The meat was incredibly tender.  The fries that soften when the sauce from the meat soaks in are divine.  The chicken - Pio Pio or Viva Chicken - Viva Chicken is a clear winner.  It is tender & 3 sides.  It has a punchcard as well so build up to savings on a purchase.  The atmosphere is very zen like & the restaurant is green using compostable cutlery that does not have a funky taste or smell that is sometimes associated w/compostable items."}
{"text":"I love Viva! Awesome flavors and great customer service. I probably visit the new ballantyne location once a week. The infused rice is so good with the yellow sauce and their chicken is so flavorful. I have had The Great sandwich before and it is good as well. I really haven't had anything I haven't liked."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I should spend the next couple of minutes writing this review or calling my husband to go pick up round 2 for me...

This place is ridiculous and I am seriously upset at myself for taking such a long time to check it out and therefore depriving myself of this deliciousness for so long. First of all, I LOVE Peruvian rotisserie chicken and have been obsessed with it for over 8 years now. I went to school in DC and fell madly in love with \"The Chicken Place\" in Falls Church, VA. Ever since moving back, I have pretty much boycotted Peruvian chicken places since I didn't think I would ever find anything that could compete, but I was wrong. 

Today my husband picked up Viva Chicken and brought it to me at work. I ordered \"The Great\" sandwich, with fried Yucca as a side and all 3 sauces that they have available. I believe that sauces are extremely important in Peruvian cuisine and without good sauce you've got nothing, so let me start with the sauces in order or spiciest to least spicy: Roasted Rocoto Sauce (also known as the Gringo killer) although I am not a Gringa, I do not think this sauce lived up to its name as far as spice goes, but MORE than made up for that in flavor. It is a little spicy, a little vinegary and completely full of flavor, I think it kind of tasted like a vinegar based South American BBQ sauce! The Huacatay sauce was also very good, it is dark green and full of different herbs, making it slightly spicy but full of flavor. Now, for the Pièce de résistance, the Aji Amarillo sauce. It is not spicy at all, but I don't care and no one else should because this is the tastiest damn sauce on the face of this planet. This is the essence of Peruvian cooking, I just want to put it in a bag and inject it into my veins intravenously 24/7, its magnificent. It's the kind of sauce that makes you not want to brush your teeth for three days just so you don't lose the flavor!

The sandwich I had, \"The Great,\" came with pulled rotisserie chicken, onions, tomato, lettuce and smoked rocoto mayo on ciabatta bread. It was a really good sandwich, but once I put the Aji Amarillo and Roasted Rocoto Sauce on it, it because a fantastic sandwich. To be honest, Yucca normally always requires sauce because it can be a little dry, but this Yucca was perfect all on it's own. It was not dense at all, it was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and although it didn't need sauce, it was perfection dipped in a mix of the Huacatay and Aji Amarillo.

The food was just fantastic and I cannot wait to go back and try something else (probably tomorrow)... and drench it in unhealthy amounts of the Aji Amarillo sauce!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious! The chicken is always tender and juicy, the yucca fries are amazing, and the staff is super friendly! Even with a packed house, orders are taken and delivered promptly. If you haven't tried this place, it's a must! Viva Chicken!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and come at least once every other week but recently I have found chicken bones in my meals.  This is a massive problem I've noticed recently and would rather not choke on one of those things. Otherwise, the food and service are really good."}
{"text":"Visited Charlotte on a work trip and any time I travel I love to try new places. Honestly, especially something that looks like it could be a fresh new chain. Viva Chicken has my seal of approval. These are flavors you don't get conveniently anywhere else. I also love exclusivity in flavor and sauce and they had three bold condiments I couldn't get anywhere else. The menu ranges from a whole chicken with sides to wraps, sandwiches, and bowls of rice and veggies you can add chicken to for a small additional cost. Correct me if I'm wrong but vegans or anyone on a not too strict diet could enjoy this place. I applaud Viva Chicken and look forward to an Atlanta, GA location. 

P.S. it is rotisserie chicken so there can be bones in the food so watch out. Notice how that didn't stop me from delivering a 5 star review."}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING SERVICE! I just got a dog and i came here and they were welcoming me to sit on the patio and they brought me a water bowl for my pup (Paco) ! Avocados stuffed with chicken are Soooooo good! cant go wrong! THANKS viva chicken! AWESOME JOB!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Viva Chicken. I ordered the Andina Power Food Salad. Fresh and colorful. I thought I would get pulled rotisserie chicken, I believe it was boiled? Whatever the case, I did not like the flavor and/or the look of it. I scooped it into a napkin and ate the tasty salad. The vibe was great, nice music, it was clean and very was busy. I will definitely go back again to try the rotisserie chicken, which seems to be the popular dish."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fresh ingredients. Great sauces and their chicken is so so so good. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I love all the Viva's but this location is my favorite.  It is large and has adequate parking and seating.  The sauce bar is located away from the soda area so it creates less congestion.  Their food is phenomenal.  The quinoa stuffed avocados are delicious - I always add the chicken to make it a meal.  The arroz chaufa is my favorite dish - it is a Peruvian fried rice.  The Great is my go-to sandwich there.  I've never met anyone who didn't like their cilantro rice.  Probably my favorite casual restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! All the ingredients from the meats, to the sides, to the original drinks, and even the salsas had such a fresh taste to them. Peruvian food is typically bland, but Viva Chicken has done an excellent job of adding bold flavor without losing authenticity. My family is Peruvian and I cannot wait for them to try this place!"}
{"text":"When I tell you that I can eat the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado Salad with chicken every day, I can! It's the only meal that I order. I also love the plantains too! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times for lunch and I am completely obsessed with the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado appetizer. I've gotten it every time I've been there and it doesn't disappoint. The avocados are always the perfect consistency - never too firm or mushy, and the quinoa is the perfect pillow for the pulled chicken that's drizzled with the yummiest mayo and balsamic sauces. My only critique is that I wish they would put more of the sauces on top! It's so delicious that I often find myself craving it. Case and point: I had leftovers in the fridge at work from my visit earlier in the week and it's all I could do to make it to the appropriate lunch hour, so that I could devour it without being judged.

Service is typically good, though on my last visit my manager received her food and I had to wait for what seemed like a good bit of time before my food came out, despite ordering right behind her. Nonetheless, it was worth the wait. Definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Ballantyne area looking for a new lunch/dinner option."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because there is never enough seating! The chicken is absolutely amazing and I love all the different sauces they offer! They have so many healthy options on the menu! I really love the chopped salad with edamame on it. During my visit yesterday a sweet lady came around to our table and suggested different sauces to us and refilled our waters. Great customer service and they even accommodated my allergy needs without problem! 

Updated Review: Still always a solid choice for lunch or dinner and recently I discovered the stuffed avocado which is to die for! I always love coming here and don't guilty after eating because most of the menu is very healthy. I seriously love the green beans which have ginger in them! If you haven't been here you are missing out!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to eat if you are going low carb or are eating gluten free-ish. Nothing here can be certified gluten free, but it's easy to avoid. We had a 1/2 chicken with green beans and a house salad, and a 1/4 chicken with green beans and rice. It was all delicious and fresh. We dined in, and while it took a bit to be served, it wasn't horribly long. The reason for the three stars is the service and atmosphere. The server brought the order and my meal was wrong. She did take the plate away but didn't say anything to me and it took longer to replace than we expected. My companions meal was almost cold by the time I was served the right meal.  This location had only been open for a day, and I think every Viva Chicken manager within a 500 mile radius was there. It was interesting none were female. The amount of Bro Bonding going on behind me, to the side of me and in front of me was ridiculous and distracting. One guy even had his fly open. Slightly disturbing while trying to eat after seeing that. Don't get me wrong here. The food is great. The service was not, and the manager meet ups going on all around us for our entire ruined it for us."}
{"text":"I'm living la viva chicken foreva!! Literally, one of the best places in Charlotte. They have it all figured out. Don't forget the derlicious sauces and drinks!! You can not go wrong with anything here"}
{"text":"Diana was a GREAT person to come
In contact with here because I SIMPLY mentioned that they forgot to bring my churro (and I still had the number on my table) walked up to the cashier and told him, went back to sit down thinking they would bring it to me because I had the number on my table but no, he signaled to me to get up and get the churro from him. Diana came to the table for a courtesy check and heard briefly what I said about having to get up and she offered amazing customer service for the slight experience. She the best at customer retention!!! My first time here and won't be my last. Food was ok, but Diana was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Food is great.  If you call in the phone line will ring busy.  When I told them that the phone rang busy, the person at the front just said ok."}
{"text":"Omg. I have found my heaven! I'd never had Peruvian chicken or food before. I walked in and Christian helped me to pick out infused rice, 1/4 chicken, green beans, and a slice of tres leches cake. It was amazing! The green sauce that came with the meal was awesome. The chicken was well seasoned, green beans were sautéed perfectly, and the rice was cooked to perfection. I have been to this restaurant 5 times in the past 2 weeks! Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good. Had the quarter chicken dark, cilantro rice and a side salad. Very tasty. Service is quick."}
{"text":"So good! Love Viva Chicken! It is fast quick food and I prefer to pick up because the music is too loud inside. However their food is awesome. The chicken is great. Fries perfect. Stuffed avacado quinoa amazing. Cilantro rice my fav!!! And all the sauces! Compared to an authentic Peruvian place it is right up there but with a modern pep to it."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  This by far exceeded my expectations!  The most fresh ingredients ever! We had Viva Chicken in Waverly NC deliver lunch for a small group of 10 people this week during a meeting and what was supposed to be a 30 minute working lunch ended up being an hour love fest over the flavors and freshness of Viva Chicken. 
If you love fresh, clean and healthy food I suggest you RUN don't walk to a Viva Chicken near you! 
Check out the locations in their website.  
Please come to Atlanta soon! 
We are waiting for you! 
Brookhaven GA near the Whole Foods (AKA Chamblee GA) is where you want to be!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"BESSSSSST Rotisserie chicken EVER!!!  First time to Viva last night, ordered take out half order rotisserie chicken with plantains and chicken soup as sides.  So glad we finally tried Viva and immediately felt remorse for not trying it out till yesterday, lol.
The chicken is cooked perfectly ( please replace 'perfectly' with a better word, if you know one). we ordered all white meat and expecting the breast part might be a little dry (like most other rotisserie chicken) but to our surprise it was super juicy and came right off the bones.  Also the chicken breast size was normal and not too big ( I hope that's becoz they use all natural chicken and not ones grown feeding hormones for extra weight/fat).  The skin was perfectly charred and loved the taste of it, whatever spices that are rubbed on it - is just perfect. THIS IS our new go-to place for some yummy roasted chicken going forward.
The sides - fried plantains were super delicious and with that hot sauce it was too damn delicious.  Chicken soup was just amazing, loved the taste (a lil bit salty) but loved it.  Even their sauce is magic, we took the hot sauce and it was god damn delicious. perfect touch to their yummy, delicious, soft, juicy Rotisserie.
Now have to try the other items on their menu ;)"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, they have a bunch of vegan or vegetarian options. The fries are vegan, which is super important lol and I usually get the avocado quinoa salad thing with no mayo. Super delish! And you can make almost any salad vegan here. 

For vegetarians, there is the inca wrap, which my husband raves about. 

Fast & friendly service, but place gets packed quick!"}
{"text":"You can feed a family of 4 for $25!!!!! Every item on the menu is packed with flavor and the fries are really the best in Charlotte. It is good enough to reheat in a convection oven and taste as good as when they first made it. The solterito took me by suprise because the corn is 3x the size of a regular corn kernel! The mint limeade is awesome and has a little kick to it. I absolutely love the cilantro lime rice and next time I will double the order. The side salad that comes with the family meal is huge! The sauces they have are super good and I pretty much douse my food with it. 

The staff is very attentive and they work efficiently. Great job by management. They are always looking to make sure a table is spotless and quickly, too. 

 Viva chicken is the Chipotle of chicken joints!!!!!!!I LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name of the restaurant steer you away if you're a vegetarian. They offer Quinoa Stuffed Avocado that is very tasty and filling. It's under their appetizers but I consider it a meal, maybe even for two. They top it with some kind of chili mayo dressing which really doesn't need it, so I suggest ask for it on the side or if you're not in the mood for those extra calories and fat. Their yuca is one of the best I've had, perfectly fried, not soggy or stale. Their plantains aren't greasy like others so it's a good treat."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I will not be visiting viva chicken ever again. My boyfriend and I had terrible gastrointestinal symptoms within 30 minutes of eating. We both had a few items in common -- the sauce, rice, and chicken soup in common. We were both well before eating and hadn't eaten anything prior. It was so bad I had to get electrolyte replacement from the drug store. It was so severe we kept having to pull over on the side of the road because we were sick :("}
{"text":"There are so many things like about Viva Chicken:

1. Affordable price
2. Cute location
3. Plenty of parking
4. Oh yeah fresh and delicious food
5. Sangria they serve sangria
6. To die for patio

Icing on the cake is that Viva Chicken feeds the homeless for free one night of the week EVERY week.

Their food is fresh, flavorful and pretty healthy (you can can also go all in here too)

You can't go wrong with any sandwich, stuffed avocado, chicken with two sides (plantains and the amaze rice)....

I love a good sauce I usually cover my meal with one to three...maybe a bit excessive -none are too spicy but all have some zing.

Oh yeah those plastic forks and stuff- they are compostable people!"}
{"text":"Their food is consistent and tasty, but sometimes their service leaves something to be desired. I ordered takeout last night and was then scolded at pick up for not specifying side sauces on the phone. Um, you should ask me if it something that needs to be pointed out earlier."}
{"text":"The food and staff here are fantastic. Make sure to try reach one of the sauces as they add a LOT of flavor to the already delicious chicken. The fried plantains are also on point and the staff is incredibly attentive."}
{"text":"Had my order to go, do I could enjoy back at the hotel. Had quarter chicken, with jasmine infused rice and side of green beans. Hot back to the hotel and food was just the right temp, presentation was very nice and the smell was wonderful.  All items were equally delicious, can't wait to go again, meal price was reasonable"}
{"text":"Great chicken and all the sides are amazing. Sauces are also to die for but the main thing for me is the customer service. Couldn't ask for a better wait staff."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I can't stop ordering The Great as a wrap with either a salad or plantains as my side. Everything is so yummy! The sauces are to die for! The mild (yellow) and the hot (red) are my favorite! The alfajores cookies are also AMAZING! I tell everyone about this place and have gotten two of my clients hooked on Viva Chicken."}
{"text":"Yum-yum-yummy. Picked up lunch and it was still nice and hot when I got home. Okay; I admit the sweet plantains didn't make it home. They were that. good. The chicken sandwich was good, but the bread made it wonderful!"}
{"text":"They have a great selection of sandwiches and salads. The Wow lomito is awesome. You can not go wrong dining here. Their service is on point and the ingredients are always fresh"}
{"text":"The food was very different with lots of flavor! I am not a big fan of spicy foods so I was limited in things to try but overall I really enjoyed my meal.
The outside seating area was wonderful and the overall environment was just very pleasant.
The staff was also extremely nice. Took time to explain the menu to me and make recommendations, especially given my extremely low tolerance of spicy foods."}
{"text":"Fantastic, really fresh food!  One of our new favorites.  I love the Great sandwich; the bread is always spot on with the perfect amount of crunchy crust and chewy bread.  The chicken is so flavorful and moist.  The sandwich doesn't really need any sauce, but the accompanying sauce on the side really does add a new depth of flavor when added.

Customer service is impeccable as well.  My 5 yr old spilled his very full cup of fruit all over the floor.  They immediately came to help us clean up and brought another fruit cup free of charge.  I really appreciated this as it was totally our fault that the fruit cup spilled in the first place.  It's small, kind gestures like this that will make me a dedicated patron.

Thanks to the owners and management for a well trained staff and great, healthy food choices!"}
{"text":"Very modern and clean interior. Open and spacious dining area, which is definitely needed because this place is insane during lunch time!

Ordered the Peruvian Rice with Chicken and a side of Plantains. Food came out very fast and smelled great as soon as it was on the table. Rice was cooked great and a good mix of color and different crisp veggies that all worked well with the chicken and rice. The plantains were delicious! Definitely going back for more!

One thing that was a bit of a shock is the price, I thought 10+ for a Fried Rice dish a la carte was a bit much, that is until they bring it out. Take my advice, bring a friend and split an entree. Wow, normally I wouldn't be bothered by so much food but it was a TON and I wasn't really in a situation to take any to go. I'd estimate it was 1-1/2 to 2 lbs of food.

Only real complaint I'd have is that I thought their tea (half sweet/unsweet) was a bit weak in my opinion. That being said a lot of places around Charlotte over-brew their tea and you end up with a bitter taste, so I'd rather have under-brewed than over brewed. Just a nit-pit, your mileage may vary.

Make sure to give their pepper sauces a try near the soft drink machine. They have a mild, medium, and hot. The hot is nicknamed \"gringo killer\", don't let that stop you! It's not extremely spicy and gives a nice bold-tangy flavor in small quantities.

Looking forward to lunch again soon!"}
{"text":"Fast casual, clean and perfect food! Had the 1/4 white meat chicken, green beans and salad. Green beans were perfect and deliciously seasoned. Chicken was spot on and juicy. Side salad was perfect, mixed greens and great portion. Atmosphere is A+++, patio is amazing with cool natural shades. Menu also has sandwiches and other great selections! I can't wait to go back! PS - Eco friendly!"}
{"text":"So damn good. Just go. Do yourself a favor and go. Like, now. I got Arroz Chaufa and drizzled some Aji Amarillo sauce on it. Three thumbs up. 

Service was awesome as well. Nice family environment."}
{"text":"Such great food! We can walk there from our house and it's definitely a go to for dinner. We have never been disappointed in their food and have always gotten awesome service. Make sure you get a lot of the yellow sauce! It's medium spicy and sooooo delicious. It goes with everything!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Yellow sauce is life! I would suggest the arrow chaufa, limena chopped salad, or the great wrap."}
{"text":"This is possibly the best place to eat chicken in the city of Charlotte. I am extremely impressed with the quality of food they serve for the money you pay. You can smell the quality of food the moment you walk in the door, and not to mention a very friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"There are a number of things in life that I repeatedly choose to do even though I secretly know they're certain to end in heartbreak. Buying scratch lottery tickets comes to mind, as does going to see Adam Sandler movies. And on the food side, we have rotisserie chicken. It always looks so great with its glistening crisp skin, but when you get this at a restaurant, you are almost certainly assured to bite into something with the approximate moisture content of the Atacama desert. 

Viva, however, has defied the laws of \"gastrophysics\". Let me count the ways in which this chicken reigns supreme:

1. Moisture: When I started at the breast, I seriously thought I had accidentally grabbed dark meat instead. But no, it was merely the juciest roasted white meat I have had the privilege to come across. Yowza.

2. Flavor: The Peruvian seasonings on this stuff are mysterious but deeply satisfying. While the skin is of course the best part, even the meat itself had a complex flavor profile.

3. MORE flavor: If the seasonings weren't enough, the chicken comes with two sauces. The yellow one is sort of mustard-y, and the green one is more garlicky, sort of like a chimichurri. I literally spent the whole meal alternating between the two and thinking \"This one's better. No, THIS one's better. No, the first one was better.\" If I hadn't eventually finished the chicken, this probably would have put me in an asylum.

Add to this experience a truly fabulous Peruvian response to chicken noodle soup, and you have an utterly undeniable reason to head over to Elizabeth."}
{"text":"I figured since I've been here 4 (5?) times in the past month, it was time to write a review, although it won't be much different than the others. Viva Chicken is phenomenal- truly delicious, inexpensive, unique food that I haven't found elsewhere in Charlotte. I always look forward to going and trying something new because I know it will be tasty. Be sure to try their drinks as well- especially the purple corn juice (sounds weird but tastes great) and the herbal lemonade. The employees are always attentive and helpful as well. 

I am already looking forward to my next visit to Viva Chicken because I know I won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place gets a 2star from me on technicality only. The food was good, the service was okay. What really ticked me off about this place was the  process and thoughtlessness. I order $50 worth of food for me and a friend. The food comes with drinks that they fill the cups with the beverage of choice up at the cash register. I put in two orders with two drinks. They served me the drinks up at the register, one with a lid and the other without (disaster waiting to happen). I also order Tre's leche cake for desert. The manager assists the lady at the counter in putting my order in and gathering it together. He gives me my drinks and cake and also a number so they can identify who ordered the food when it's being delivered to the table. I pay and head into the dining area to find a seat. 5 minutes into waiting for the food, the manager makes his way to our table to tell us that he had given us the desert (1 Tres leche cake) but the girl up front didn't ring  it up so we hadn't paid for it. He admitted that it was their mistake and asked for my credit card to charge it. At this point, I'm skeptical but I hand him my credit card so as not to make a scene. He charges the card and doesn't even bring back a receipt or anything for me to sign. I was there with a friend and didn't want to cause a scene but my mind was on that charge and how it was done. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but I think it speaks volumes. The restaurant made a mistake, that happens but have some class and don't come back and ask to charge for something that should have been done the first time, especially when we just went through a big ordeal at the counter with miscommunication. I was aggravated, to say the least, at the counter and when he came back to take my credit card, it just show incompetency. Moreover, you take my card and you don't even bring a recipe back?  On top of all these events, as the food is being delivered the $6 cup of uncovered red wine sangria is tipped over bu the server all over my friend. It was an accident and the server was helpful and did her best but there were other staff who just stood there and watched. After cleaning ourselves up, they didn't ask us for we want another drink, I had to ask for it and the server was kind enough to go and get it. The whole visit just set the wrong tone and the visit was just very unpleasant."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken deserves all 5 stars in my book. It is hands down my favorite quick serve restaurant in Charlotte, mainly because of the amazing food flavors. From the cilantro-infused rice to the sauce bar to the plantains and rotisserie chicken, you will leave feeling full and satisfied. There are plenty of healthier options (my favorite is the Andina Power Food Salad) and some sweet tooth desserts (my favorite are the Alfajores) if you're in the mood to treat yourself. It does get pretty crowded around dinner time but the service is quick. Put it on your list to visit if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Viva chicken honestly is one of the best places I've ordered rotisserie chicken. It is so savory and tender. It was a little pricey, but it was most definitely worth it. The female cashier was extremely friendly and provided exceptional service! The sauces also added a little zest to the chicken. I also liked the outdoor area. I would most definitely come here again the next time I visit Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I get lunch from here while at work about once a month.  Each time I do so, I have another excellent experience.  I order online and my food is always ready when I go to pick it up.  They are always slammed when I come in but I still get excellent customer service.  I have now had almost everything on the menu and all of it is tasty.  I particularly enjoyed the chopped limena salad, the jalapeno bacon adds some spice and gives the extra crunch.  I never thought I would look forward to a salad, but it always fills me, and I feel like I am eating healthy.  This place is a must."}
{"text":"i totally love their chicken. everytime i'm at PMC Novant, i have to eat here. I love the canary beans but the green beans need to be seasoned and cooked more. I'm glad they have another location.  Nice service and priced right for the product."}
{"text":"The food is so amazing, I tried his place out because it was recommended by a friend. The Service was great, I will be returning and bring more people."}
{"text":"My new go to Peruvian spot !! Yummy and the sauces are so good. We got 2 quarter chickens that came with 2 sides we chose fried plantains and cilantro rice (w/ green peas and spot pieces of carrots) it was all very tasty! My one complaint is the rice portions could be a lot bigger. I mean seriously it's the cheapest thing on the menu and it's barely enough rice. Definitely no leftovers! But still I will be back to try more. The flavors alone are worth it. Also tried a chicken wrap don't remember the name. But my fiancé loved it. We were almost tempted to go back for dinner the same day ... But we contained ourselves."}
{"text":"Busy place during lunch, but the line moved quickly and we were served hot meals.  While we waited, the staff came to our table and refilled our self-serve drinks (awesome!).  Food is delicious, healthy and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service.  New location does not disappoint.  Much bigger than Ballamtyne; seats more people and line moves quickly.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  We love Viva Chicken!!"}
{"text":"I had the 1/4 chicken and it was awesome. The sides were even better (string beans) are fantastic. I love the atmosphere and highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are still very nice, but the service has declined over the past few months. Most recently the person just said \"next in line\" and then seemed to be unnerved if you ordered outside of his normal script. They also ditched the compost/recycle option in favor of just a general trash can. They also used to bring water and a treat when you brought your pup - that nice touch is gone, too. 

Hopefully things don't continue to decline as they've started to franchise."}
{"text":"Just gonna say - yummy. I was a newbie and met a friend for lunch.. I ordered the menu item that I could best pronounce correctly and hit a winner. Portions are generous... Tastes are complex and prices are affordable.. I will be returning for round two.."}
{"text":"This popular rotisserie chain is always crowded for a reason - it delivers on all counts! The food is excellent, as is the service, and the atmosphere, particularly at this new location in Waverly, is roomy and festive. Compared to its compact location in Ballantyne, the dining room here is cavernous and attractive.

You wait in a small queue, somewhat reminiscent of Disney World, and select your entree from five main categories: Rotisserie chicken (their specialtu), salads, wraps and grain howls. The rotisserie chicken is tender and delicious and has wonderful dipping sauces from mild to hot. Can't go wrong with any of the sides either.

This was our second trip in a week, both on Sundays at lunch time. We tried the Peruvian Fried Rice, the Viva Salad and the Limena Chopped Salad which consisted of Kale Romaine Mix, Solterito (Peruvian Corn, Edamame, Queso Fresco), Jalapeño Bacon, Crispy Chickpeas, Aji Amarillo Ranch Dressing and added the pulled chicken. It ran about 10 bucks. Was excellent but next time I will ask for the dressing on the side and nix the Peruvian corn. 

Last trip everyone in my party chose the Tacu Bowl with pulled chicken. It included Cilantro Infused Jasmine Rice, Canary Beans, Salsa Criolla (Lime Marinated Onions and Tomatoes), Avocado, Green Onions. Everything was fresh and delicious. Quantities are substantial.

Everything is also affordable and the place is immaculate (of course, it should be, as it is spanking brand new). In a shopping center full of blase chain restaurants, this one is definitely a Gotta Try! I plan to return very soon."}
{"text":"Viva has a special place in my heart. I wont make this review too long, but below is what you need to know:

1. Order the quinoa stuffed avocados every time and add chicken! My husband and I always split them, but it's also big enough for a meal. I usually get the 1/2 order with a side of plantains for my meal.

2. Plantains are a must here! Sweet, savory and delicious. TIP: Dip them in the green sauce- it's so good! 

3. Speaking of sauces- they have 3, but my favorite is the new red sauce. A bit of a kick, but not too overpowering. All are made from different types of Peruvian peppers! 

4. The Arroz Chaufa is awesome- plus add the chicken. Mix in the sauces and you have a dynamite meal! The ginger gives it a little bit of a kick, but it's so darn good! They usually have this as a weekly late lunch special too during the week (2-5)  so be on the look out for that! 

I can go on and on, but these are my top picks here! You can't really compare them to any of the other Peruvian restaurants in Charlotte. They aren't completely authentic, but the food is awesome and it's a great fast casual option that never gets old."}
{"text":"Avocado, check. Chicken, check. Quinoa, check. Sauce from the heavens, check. Sorry guys I just described the best thing ever that you MUST try at Viva Chicken! The quinoa stuffed avocados (with Chicken) are to die for. They are actually on the appetizer menu, but I recommend getting it as your meal. If you get the full order you get a WHOLE avocado (cut in half) or you can opt for the half order, which is a half avocado. I hold food very deep to my heart and I'm telling you now that you won't regret ordering this!

Besides these god sent avocados they have other awesome dishes. I recommend first timers to try the plantains and the white rice with the yellow sauce. I have also had their fried rice with chicken and it was amazing! It's always on their lunch specials too ($6) and the portion size is HUGE! You can easily split it with 2 people.

Now I'm kind of upset that I wrote this review because I'm craving these avocados- maybe I'll head there for lunch :-)

ps. No matter what time I've came they have always been busy so be prepared to search for seating, but I promise you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Viva Chicken for the first time and it was delicious! We heard from several friends how good it was so we had to try it out. I was a little skeptical going first thing in the morning (11AM) for fear we would get old food from yesterday but every morsel was fresh and delicious. 

We searched Yelp (of course) before ordering and went with some food suggestions (1 whole chicken, cilantro rice, plantains and a variety of sauces). The hubby went and picked up the order and was treated to samples of fresh juices that he raved about to me. Next time we will definitely go eat in the restaurant. 

Kids loved the food so we're excited to have another place to go with them, knowing we're not wasting money. Thanks Viva for our new fav place to dine."}
{"text":"My husband and I just left there today. The food and the service was great! I had 1/4 chicken with two sides when I say it was great it was that great!! Our lunch/dinner was less than $20.00. Place was very clean. And that's why I give this restaurant a five star.

I'll be back again and again"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  Yes, it's chicken but chicken can be great if it's slow roasted and combined with incredible ingredients such as plantain, quinoa, and three amazing sauces.  This is convenient food made heathy and made right.  Go get some!"}
{"text":"If you want to eat good flavorful food and not feel guilty about it, this is it! I got the chicken breast, plantains, and green beans and they were amazing! I can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken was so delicious and fresh! Reasonably priced good food. Really enjoyed the quinoa stuffed avocado and all of the sauces. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"one of our favorite places to eat in Charlotte including my daughters. Everything I've tried is great and fresh. Salads, chicken, cilantro rice, fried yuca, etc. etc."}
{"text":"The chicken is always delicious, the sides and sauces are excellent.  Plus the staff is super helpful and friendly.  Always a great experience"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever trying Peruvian food, let alone Viva Chicken and my taste buds fell in LOVE!!!! I really enjoyed the Latin flavors without a crazy amount of seasoning. The soup \"Sopa de Pollo\" was phenomenal because of its simplicity. The Yuca fries are my favorite fries of all, which is a lot to say for myself. They're larger than the typical fry-size, but the Yuca \"meat\" on the inside has a wonderful taste that's not bland and the batter on the outside wasn't too thick and lightly salted. I ordered the 1/4 Chicken and 2 Sides with the cilantro infused rice as my other side. Chicken was cooked to perfection; the meat wasn't too dry and the skin wasn't too greasy. Overall, Viva Chicken is probably going to be my go-to spot for simple, yet heart-warming dishes."}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious. I have had several things off of the menu and not once been disappointed. Th e chicken is so good whether it is in the bone of off the bone mixed in stir-fry or salad. The dessert is very good also and the different beverages I have enjoyed as well."}
{"text":"The food is consistently delicious here. It's not fancy but it's amazing comfort food that won't make you feel guilty afterwards! I adore the Tacu Bowl (hold the onions) and love all three sauces you can get for the dishes (I honestly can't pick my favourite).

Quick, no frills service, generous helpings and a great little covered patio during warmer weather. A little neighbourhood gem in Elizabeth!"}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced for the walk up, order and seat yourself model.  My wife is Peruvian and we struggle to come up with why rotisserie chicken is associated with Peru.  It's our opinion and conclusion that it's a convenient way to use chicken as the conduit for getting all the Peruvian sauces and sides on the menu. 
Overall, the food was good.  Decent portions, nice plating, everything was hot.
Not nearly enough seating at the Elizabeth location.  We felt rushed once we were close to being done, almost hovered over.  

If I happened to be in the neighborhood, I'd likely try other joints out first.  If I were invited for business, I wouldn't object, it just would not be a \"have to go\"."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is consistently fantastic at each location. We are so thankful that the Waverly restaurant is open. Everything is great on the menu and allergy friendly. So many options and fantastic service!  If you need a quick bite and don't want to sacrifice quality you should definitely try them out."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is simply amazing. Great food, great service. My favorite is the Inca wrap and passion fruit juice! I heard the nachos and quinoa stuffed avocado are so good and will be trying those next!"}
{"text":"Wen't here because Lemuria said she liked it and that was good enough for me. I'm usually vegan for cholesterol reasons, but I needed some chicken. I went on a long hike. I could feel myself getting sick and I knew I needed something more than tofu protein, so I bit the bullet. I do this about once every 6 months in an act of desperation. It never works. I'm home sick today writing this review, but I really enjoyed the chicken so meh it was worth the break!  After a couple of years being vegan I don't usually enjoy chicken but this was so good. The Peruvian spices were excellent on the chicken and the the rotisserie was fresh and tender, but the side sauces were insane. I especially liked the green one. I'm definitely going back on vegan days because they also had this amazing avocado stuffed with quinoa and tons of other sides I didn't get a chance at that look amazing. Ooh and dessert. I didn't get my dessert. Noooo! The tragedy of being sick! Viva Chicken we have business."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!! GREAT SERVICES!! NICE EMPLOYEES! Parking was easier then I thought, found a great parking spot. So why did I not give it 5stars? Because that places is SUPER loud, PACKED, and small. That's my ONLY Downfall about this place"}
{"text":"Ate lunch with mom and sister here today. Easy to get to from hospital so we just walked across street. Place was supper busy when we arrived at little after 1 but the line moved fairly fast and service was just as fast. 

I had The Great wrap and it was delicious. Used the medium sauce and gave it just enough bite. Tried the fried plantains but they were fried without \"smashing\" and frying twice which is the way I prefer, so one.less star just because I like them a little different. 

Sister had Sapa De Pollo and.she used hot sauce and throughly enjoyed her meal. Mom had 1/4 chicken with green beans and house salad. Mom is very old fashioned and picky southern person but she.liked her meal and wanted the recipe for the chicken. So if they were able.to impress my mom then the food was really tasty."}
{"text":"Had a great first experience here everyone was friendly and while it being healthy it's beyond delicious. Stopped by there for the second time when I went to Charlotte could have got better service but the food was still amazing !!"}
{"text":"I like this spot. My coworkers and I went on lunch. It wasn't too busy. Service didn't take too long. I got the qtr chicken, fruit and cilantro rice. Nice lil meal. Kinda wish I got the half chicken. But I thought it was gon be too much. But anyway, put some sauce on the rice. It ain't gon do anything but enhance it. And the rotisserie chicken as u might've guessed by me wanting more is A1. I'll be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"We are out of towers in Charlotte for a wedding and came to Viva Chicken to try out some of their staples - the quinoa stuffed avocado and the great sandwich. We also ordered the taco bowl at the suggestion of the worker who took our order. We found seating outside which was quaint and beautiful with lots of plants and flowers. We had been traveling that morning and ate breakfast so we weren't incredibly hungry. But the food gave us appetite for more! The taco bowl surprised me the most, the soft rice topped with red onions, chicken, pinto beans and the side sauce for a little kick. The avocado was very filling though we got it as an appetizer - it could probably be a meal for one. Everything was delicious, customer service was great. Five stars in our book! :-)"}
{"text":"their chicken.... the best! the stuffed avocados are delicious and I could live off of the herbal limeade."}
{"text":"I love this place! Good food, service, portions and prices. The one location is now connected to the new Trolley which goes right into Uptown."}
{"text":"When I am in the Carolinas, I usually look for barbecue or for Southern comfort food (frahd chicken and banayna puddin', in particular). Although I am aware that Charlotte is a major city and home to several global financial institutions, I still was not expecting to be so deeply enamored with a Peruvian restaurant in North Carolina.

Viva Chicken is somewhat of a local chain that serves up a fantastic pollo a la brasa (tender, moist, tasty, honest-to-goodness, rotisserie chicken rubbed with a mildly spicy seasoning). The arroz chaufa (China Peruana fried rice) with pulled pollo a la brasa is another hit. What takes all this deliciousness to the next level of awesomeness is the house made sauces. The roasted rocoto sauce is the spiciest but also packed with the most flavor. The aji amarillo is smooth and creamy with a slight kick. The huacatay is basically a blend of jalapeños and cilantro; spicy, but not that special. 

The alfajores (chewy shortbread cookies with dulce de leche - caramelized milk - sandwiched between them), are a great way to finish off the meal, and the passion fruit juice and chicha morada are instant refreshment in the North Carolina heat."}
{"text":"Viva chicken, what is not to love? 
While there we had staff check on us twice, and they cleared our plates and offered refills. 

While getting my drink, the machine got stuck turned on so lemonade was simply streaming out! But the staff came quickly to my rescue and fixed it! Yay!

Don't forget sauces for your meal!"}
{"text":"We catered the viva chicken package for a work meeting and it was a big hit. We ordered chicken, cilantro rice, green beans and fruit. The delivery was prompt, and the associate helped us set it up. Loved the silverware wrapped in a napkin and square plates-- it looked great. The food was delicious and including the green and yellow sauces. We debated which was which, only to realize they were labeled on the other side! Ha! The sweet tea was very sweet and the pink lemonade was good too. Highly recommend catering Viva Chicken for your next event!"}
{"text":"If considering this restaurant for delivery through postmates or other you should know they rarely get the order right. They pay little attention to detail and management is full of excuses."}
{"text":"Omg.  I just finished eating.  I would have spent 3 times the price for this food.  I had  a half order of the stuffed avocado w/chicken (you must add the chicken).  Gourmet caliber.  Make sure you get both sauces on it. I also had the chicken soup .  SO fresh and flavorful ( if you are not a cilantro fan you can probably tell them not to put it on) Delish!
I had a side of the beans.  I found them good but compared to the other elevated items, a little bland.
I ordered and paid online.  I was in and out in 3 minutes."}
{"text":"Love the chicken!  Always good, done perfectly with lots of flavor.  First time at this location, but same good food.  Also had the fried yuca and the sweet potato fries.  My date had a rice & vegetable dish that was very tasty too.  It was kind of loud, but it was crowded so I guess that is to be expected."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating at Viva Chicken. My fiancé had always told me about loving to go here. This has to be one of the fastest and healthiest places to eat. The menu is creative and plenty of options. Today I had the Inca wrap with white rice and add chicken with sweet potato fries. The wrap is a generous portion, so I had to bring the other half home. My fiancé had the stuffed avocado salad and add chicken. The sauces looked amazing on his food. The staff is friendly and helpful with the menu. They offered me to try their homemade juices. I made a \"Vivosa,\" which is one of their juices mixed with champagne. It was delicious. There is self seating, including outdoor seating. It is covered and has netting to keep bugs out. This was a perfect, quiet dinner. There is also a register for people who ordered online to pick up. I feel that this really helps with the flow of checking out. Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"We ordered catering from viva chicken for our little sister's graduation party, and it was absolutely amazing! Lindsay, the catering coordinator, was extremely kind, and it was so easy to get a hold of her. The food was ready right on time, and once we brought the food home, everything was delicious! Everyone loved the food-- we barely had any left over! We would recommend their catering for any event!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, amazing chicken, and great variety! Since we've been in Charlotte, this has become one of our go-to places for lunch or dinner. Our entire family loves this establishment! The chicken is so tender and juicy, and there are so many sides to choose from. Not to mention, their avacado with quinoa is absolutely fantastic. They also have a catering service, and my family is very excited to have them cater for our graduation party this year!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Viva. The staff are wonderful. The food is incredible. The location is excellent. They give discounts to employees at local businesses like the hospital and us at Uptown Church.

I've not had anything don't love there. Of course. The Peruvian chicken (rotisserie) is the main thing. Just falls off the bone. I usually get a half or a quarter chicken with a couple of sides. But I will sometimes get the arroz chaufa, so good. They have great Peruvian sides! One of the best is the stuffed avocado. I will sometimes get a couple of these as a meal and I never regret it. Stuffed with chicken and quinoa, over lettuce. Other great sides are the yucca fries, the white beans, and the green beans.

Also, the sandwiches are great! You can't go wrong with The Great.

I highly recommend Viva Chicken."}
{"text":"OMG Amazeballs!!!! This place is THE ONE! Like seriously! The food is soooo delicious and the staff is great! I'm drooling just as I type and reminisce on my most recent trip to Viva Chicken. I must return very soon! Yep, a must! Thank you Viva Chicken for satisfying my tastebuds!"}
{"text":"yoyoyo my nigga this is my joint! my god these chickens are divine! its so good that it feels like im having an orgasm"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken takes rotisserie chicken to the next level, and it's a fantastic option for a (relatively) clean meal that is super satisfying.

1/2 chicken with green beans and plantains was quite a bit of food and more than enough for me, though I think a quarter would be too little. The entrees sound really interesting, and if I actually lived in Charlotte, I'd probably work my way through the menu.

I can see how the restaurant would get SWAMPED during lunch considering its location across the street from the hospital. Parking in the lot is a little confusing, but I wasn't towed...YOLO?

Viva Chicken was exactly what I wanted in a work meal on the road, and I'm happy to see a local business succeed with the fast casual rotisserie chicken concept."}
{"text":"Had catering delivered from the Elizabeth Avenue Viva Chicken to our firm yesterday.  Everything was on time, fresh and appealing to look at even down to the square paper plates.
I had great positive feedback from everyone. Great job by  Emily Ortiz the Catering Director.
We look forward to using Viva Chicken again."}
{"text":"Viva chicken is consistently beautiful fresh ingredients combined with interesting flavors and great chicken. What more do you need?? My favorites are the stuffed avocado- secret- you can get half and add chicken and it's prefect size for me. The stuffed avocado is literally a full half of avocado filled with quinoa and then I add the chicken and it has 2 sauces that go on top.. I love them both. Gosh I love that, but their chicken soup is my favorite ANYWHERE. Just such a clean broth and fresh herbs on top.. so good. They have specialty sauces at the back of the restaurant but they're all too spicy for me, I just request more of the brown sauce, I think it's a vinaigrette. Don't forget the juices when you order. They make 3 in house daily all fresh marinated with fruits and herbs, you can't go wrong. So excited I have one so close now!!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Very far away from where I live however.  Hope they open one in Mint Hill!"}
{"text":"Better than PioPio for all my friends who think there's a comparison. I just tried this place for the first time and I love the food (rating based on food, time to order, sit, and receive food, and the staff's service and knowledge). I tried some type of steak fried jasmine rice plate, quarter chicken, salad, quinoa avocado wrap, and plantains. Everything was very flavorful and cooked perfectly with nothing over-seasoned. I'll be back soon, but not between 12 & 1, the lunch rush is crazy."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner after a long day of moving, and I have to say, I'm glad I did!
The employees were polite and constantly buzzing around filling napkin dispensers, sauces, and clean the tables as fast as people were leaving.
The food was good too!
I got a bowl and wasn't sure what to expect."}
{"text":"Peruvian makes a Great pre-movie meal for the North Carolina Opening night of \"STOKER\" !  Korean Director Park Chan Wook's First American-made Movie!  My Friend (you know what I mean) is From Ecuador and he said this Beef Dish reminded him of Home!

Sweet Plantains were as good as they are like a Dessert or Appetizer or Side or, or

Outdoor Patio was perfect for early Friday evening"}
{"text":"Just in town for the Great Wolf Lodge. Got the 1/2 chicken with green beans and cilantro rice.  We also got the sopa de pollo. Both excellent. Rotisserie style chicken. The soup broth was very good. Will definitely come back when we are in town."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while and finally did.  Food was good and there were a few items I will like to try in the future.  Chicken was tender and had a good flavor.  Clean restaurant and friendly staff.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is solid. I got the 1/4 chicken with Quinoa and fries. The flavors were excellent and the sauces that come with it are all amazing. 

Prices are very fair and the food comes out quick (but not too quick). Ambience is just okay and the outdoor patio isn't heated very well in the winter. 

I will definitely come back here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Really cool concept! Great atmosphere- a little dark tho. All the sides and chicken are really diverse and prices are pretty good. The chicken was a a little salty and grizzly with some kind of charred guts still on it, eek! But the sweet potato fries, Yucca and salad with in house balsamic was so on point. Customer service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"So I needed to update my review ... The last time I came I enjoyed it okay but wanted to try it one more time with more of an open mind. This place is hyped up so much and I couldn't understand why ...Well now I do. I ordered my food on the phone for pickup. Food was ready when I got there I'm less than 10 minutes. The service was excellent and everyone was friendly. For me that goes a long way. I got the kids meal with pulled chicken and cilantro rice. Excellent choice. It even comes with a drink including the speciality drinks. I appreciate that! Don't limit me to fountain drinks I'm here because I want to try what makes you stand out. They allowed me to sample them which was great. My favorite was the purple one...It has a hint of cinnamon ... Very appropriate for the winter. And the food was just enough ! If you are not super hungry you will do good with the kids meal. I had a little leftover. My favorite sauce is the orange and yellow I mixed it all in the rice and chicken. Delicious!!!!!!!!! It was so fresh and flavorful but beware as the sauce can be a little spicy which I like.  So although I was trying not to join the hype of this place I have . Nothing beats excellent service and excellent food with a good price. Try them out!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken, which pegs itself as having good food and good mood, does well at accomplishing both!

Perched right on Elizabeth Avenue, you can sample their delicious food while watching the new Charlotte Trolley go by. It's also near a point where you can board the trolley to your next destination if you so choose.

The restaurant offers a variety of vegetarian options for everyone from salads to sandwiches and wraps and even signature juices!

I had the Inca Wrap on my first visit and  highly recommend it! It's delicious! It's a tomato wrap with canary beans, rice, avocado and salsa. You can add chicken or steak to it if you're more of a carnivore.

Also, the highest you'll pay for anything on the menu is $12.50 for the Classic Saltado.

It's a nice chill atmosphere very conducive to conversation. 

Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Had the quinoa stuffed avocado last time so trying out the Naked Peruvian with chicken. It was great in a wrap with sweet potato fries. The cashier was patient and willing to make suggestions when i was asking about the different items even though the line was getting long. Great experience!"}
{"text":"The chicken is excellent and the balsamic dressing is very tasty!!!!!! Healthy, delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We love, love, love Viva Chicken. It's quick, convenient, fresh, healthy, and flavorful. You can't get much better than that. The three sauces make just about anything delicious and we like to grab extra to take home. Our favorite it the verde sauce which is the \"medium\" choice between yellow and red. My go-to the taco bowl without chicken. Despite the name, I am very happy with the numerous vegetarian options. My husband loves the Inca wrap with a side salad. We have also enjoyed several of the entree salads and the sweet plantains are just perfect. This spot is great for everyone, solo diners grabbing a quick weekday lunch, families, or couples on a date. You can't go wrong with anything topped with the sauce, and adding a quinoa stuffed avocado to your meal is never a bad idea."}
{"text":"Overrated if they had a La Granja here from SoFlo they would be out of business. Way over priced for some rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"I continue to be impressed with the Viva Chicken team!!Their food is delicious and keto friendly (think quinoa avocado minus quinoa add chicken). They are well organized with catering from ordering to pick up. The food is well packaged. They thank you for your business! And best of all their support our local community! 

P.S. Viva Chicken thank you for your support of the 2018 Charlotte LUNGe Forward 5K, Walk & Rally! May 19th at Park Road Park ??"}
{"text":"Took me a while to finally get here and it was phenomenal.

My first experience with Peruvian food and man have I been missing out.

I got 1/4 Chicken with Cilantro Infused Rice and Green Beans with mild, medium, and hot sauces and a Herbal Lemonade to drink. Chicken was so moist and I wasn't a huge fan of the green beans but I really like the rice. I liked all the drinks they make in house as well.

I can't wait to go back here!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of chicken, and anything chicken, I'll definitely eat it.

I'm really happy that Viva Chicken was a great chicken place. Stopped by on a Tuesday to grab some lunch with my boyfriend. He had the 1/4 chicken with sweet potato fries and a salad. I had the linguine entree. His fries were tasty and crunchy. We both loved it. OMG I love the sauce that they used for the salad. That was the best part. The chicken was perfectly cooked and still had juice. It was delicious. My entree was good, but I wished it had a little more flavor. Towards the bottom, it became salty. I really appreciate all the chicken they used for the entree, though. We also ordered their passion fruit drink. LOVED it! We had to get a 2nd one. The inside was nice and comfy. The designs reminded me of korean restaurants in korea. I had no problem what so ever here.

We came back the same week on thursday and it was super busy. Maybe Thursday is one of their busy days? The cashier guy recognized us, which is good cause that show he knows his customers. My boyfriend got the same thing he ordered on Tuesday but this time, the chicken was a little dry and the fries were soggy. Of course the salad and the sauce were still good. I LOVE the sauce. I just tried the stuffed avocado that a lot of people were suggesting. It was really good. I'm guessing they used the same sauce as the salad dressing for the topping because it tasted and looked like it. Don't get me wrong, I love avocado and chicken, so obviously I liked the appetizer, but it's nothing to raved about. I was really good food though. 

Really enjoyed the experiences here and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Do you need another positive Viva Chicken review?  Probably not but here goes. Finally got to try this place for the first time when a girl from work went for pickup orders. I have been missing out!  I got the Inca wrap with chicken  and a side of the chicken soup. My next advice to you is do not sleep on the soup!Get it!  It is not your average chicken noodle and I'm already craving it again. When I'm well I want it and if I get sick I'm going to hoard it. Also...that wrap! Fantastic! I'm sure the plain chicken is great. All for about 9 bucks I believe plus the sauces. If a to go order was this good I'm sure eating inside is even better. I'll be back to this viva chicken for sure."}
{"text":"I go to viva chicken all the time and it's always delicious. The specialize in their Peruvian style roasted chicken and have lots of variations and sides to choose from. The restaurant is almost always packed in the evenings and on weekends. You can usually find a table, but you'll be dodging people and waiting in line for sauces. Parking is somewhat limited, but you can always find something within a few blocks near Elizabeth. 

I usually get a quarter roasted chicken with green beans and sweet potato fries as my side. All of the sides are pretty great, but these are definitely my favorite. The chicken is tender and very well seasoned. The skin is absolutely delicious. The stuffed avocado on quinoa is also a very good and fairly healthy dish to go for. 

The sauces are awesome. The yellow sauce is my favorite. I sometimes take extra home to sip other foods into as well. 

They have a small selection of local canned beers along with fountain sodas and lemonades. 

I always enjoy eating here and plan to keep it in my regular rotation!"}
{"text":"I was asked several times if I was ok, can we refill your drink, and how is everything several times throughout my visit. Much appreciated and well received from someone who doesn't expect much at a $10 price point. 

Not to mention the food is amazing and the sauces are nothing like you have had before!

If you're looking for an amazing experience, all around, take a trip to Viva!"}
{"text":"I wish I could have tried everything. Ordered a 1/4 chicken with sweet potato fries and a side salad. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and fell off the bone. My wife had the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado with Chicken and a side of plantains. Definitely going to be back soon to try some more items."}
{"text":"Found this place after a 20 mile bike ride and the food it really tasty fresh and enjoyable. The staff is very helpful and always polite. I have been there a few times after my first visit and always really happy with everything. The soup is amazing along with everything else I have had. The price is a little high for a walk up food place and I suspect this is due to it being so fresh. I will be back again and again. I love South American food and it reminds me of being in Colombia. Overall AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Quick, check. Healthy options, check. Large portions, check. Nice staff, check. Great sauce spread, check. We get takeout here almost weekly. Great location in the heart of Elizabeth too. It's unfortunate they aren't open later - check and make sure you don't try to get a late bite here, you'll be disappointed. They are almost always busy, but they get the food out very quickly, which I very much appreciate. The wraps are great, and they can sub ingredients no problem. I appreciate they always get it right too, which sometimes lacks with quick food. The salads are my favorite-awesome, healthy ingredients. Thanks Viva!"}
{"text":"THE BEST! This place will blow your mind. Basically rotisserie chicken with great sides. Plantains, quinoa, sweet potato fries, and spiced lemonade are to die for. Service is always helpful and food is quick. They also cater. If you are not an adventurous foodie, this place is still for you. I find most of the food to be mile unless you choose one of their 3 sauces to take it up a notch."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Great food, great atmosphere, knowledgeable and friendly staff. This has become one of my favorite places to dine in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Was in town from Los Angeles and decided to stop by before heading back home. My only regret is that we didn't stop by sooner! Super awesome atmosphere, amazingly delicious food and great staff. We ordered the half chicken meal with sweet potato fries and green beans and the quinoa chicken stuffed avocados = AMAZING! it hit the spot perfectly. It was enough to fill us my husband and I up without being overly stuffed. The chicken was moist, the veggies and fries tasted fresh and the side dipping sauces, OMG!!! The fambam originally wanted The Habit down the street but they were SO glad we vetoed their decision. Everyone definitely enjoyed it!!! We will be back whenever we're back in that area! 
P.S. we've tried many Peruvian chicken places out here in LA and I can say this is definitely in our top three places!!! THANK YOU FOR MAKING AMAZING, FRESH, HEALTHY  FOOD!"}
{"text":"I LOVE viva chicken. I feel like I've eaten at every Charlotte location, but the Ballantyne location is closest to where I work. I always get the adina power food salad, it's hands down one of my favorite meals... from anywhere... EVER. I eat at Viva probably once every other week if not once a week. I really want to give this location 5 stars because I love the food so much, but I have a problem with the employees. Every time I eat here (usually between anywhere from 2pm-4pm) it seems to me they are annoyingly overstaffed. Like all the employees don't have anything to do, so they start trying to find things to do to look busy. I've had someone come lean over my table and clean it while I was halfway through my meal. I've sat at a booth close to the kitchen and had 5-6 workers leaning all over my booth shouting and laughing at each other while I'm trying to eat. It happens almost every time I'm there. Now I just get take out because I can hardly stand to eat in their dining room anymore. Still love the food, just not a huge fan of the dining experience."}
{"text":"I must admit I have never been to the actual  restaurant which I'm dying to do because what I receive from delivery is the best food ever! 

They should NEVER stop making the tres leche cake! Most nights I attempt to order it, it has already been sold out, but when I do get to eat it , it's divine. Onto the main courses, I started with their rotisserie chicken and it was so good I began try everything on the menu to see what they made the best. Needless to say I was not disappointed. I order from them each week wether it be sun dried tomato wraps, ginger green beans or seasoned rice, it's all good and it all in one place VIVA CHICKEN!"}
{"text":"Service, service, service people... the number one reason I rank this restaurant a 2 is service.  I walk in and I am promptly greeted and my order is taken. My order of 1/4 Chicken with 2 sides is complete by 12:46 pm. I literally wait until 1:03 pm before my order is handed to me and I'm out the door. Now I understand it's lunch and a Friday, but come on guys. You are clearly fully staffed. Everyone appears busy, but your system is horrible. Unless this bird was piping hot (which means they just cooked the chicken) to the point of me having to wait until it cools before eating, there is no excuse for the time it took to prepare a very basic, and non modified order. Do better. Set a better standard for yourself. Until then, I'll take coin elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not bad Viva Chicken, not bad. I came here because of the rave reviews. Nice fast casual spot and a refreshing change from a place like Chipotle. 

I ordered the 1/4 chicken (white meat), with the cilantro rice and plantain for my sides. The chicken was flavorful and fresh. The rice was sticky, as in slightly overcooked so that was a bit disappointing but it wasn't terrible. The plantain was tasty.  I enjoyed the assortment of sauces available.

The restaurant (including the bathrooms) was super clean. The staff was friendly which is always a plus to me!

I wasn't blown away but I had a very pleasant experience nonetheless and would love to go back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Awesome stop for a \"fast food\"/\"quick service\" for Peruvian food. 
I almost never drink juice but when I'm in St George I can't turn down a chance to have their chica morada (peruvian purple corn) or maracuya (passion fruit) drinks!
I only wish the huacainia sauce was spicier!"}
{"text":"Delicious & yummy food, tasty salsa, reasonable price options and clean surroundings too.  I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Was randomly told about this place and since I was in the area, I decided to give it a try. The staff was so helpful with me being a newbie. They were patient with telling me the ingredients of some of the side items and even gave me a sample of all the juices (all of which were very satisfying to the taste). When it came down to getting my meal, the manager made sure I was aware of the sauces and then brought them out to me when the line was too long! The chicken was simply delicious. I only ordered a quarter. But when I finished, I was wanting more! Definitely need a second trip to this place!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, deliciously seasoned, impossibly moist chicken with an interesting array of side dish choices to choose from. We came on a sunny spring afternoon, ordered a couple of Mexican beers, and sat out on the terrace to enjoy our meal. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hot-diggity-dog this place is good!  My fiancé and I were in town from Portland visiting and we read about this place online and had to visit.  It's a solid five star establishment.  Prior to walking in the delicious aroma of this place swirls around you outside and sweeps you into the restaurant.  I had the 1/2 chicken meal with fried plantains and sweet potato fries.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  If I had a complaint it would be that it was so much food, but let's be honest that's not really a valid complaint.  The plantains reminded me of when I visited Belize and tasted very similar.  I can't wait to come back and try the stuffed avocados!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. A great and reasonably priced lunch spot. Heaping portions that you can stretch to two meals if you felt like it, but it's so delicious that you may not be able to resist. So glad that they are currently building a third location in Charlotte over in the Montford area."}
{"text":"A crazy busy Saturday night and this place is crazy busy, excitedly loud, and smelling yummy.  The manager, Justin, and his helper, Corey, are smiling and treating everyone with love and kindness.  The food is excellent as always.  The crew is efficient and making it s fun experience.  It is clean and happy and what it always is here--a wonderful experience.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Gorgeous outside section, immediate service, excellent food and great value. They offer a variety of delicious drinks, from the Maracuya to the Inca Cola. The Wow Lomito is to die for. My one complaint was that the plantains were over cooked. If not for this I would give them 5 stars and if I could I would give it 4.5. Good music too."}
{"text":"After much debating about Peruvian cuisine, the kitchen and fast food like counters made me visit this restaurant! The ambience was good in rustic style of black and brown colors with dim to medium lighting. I took a chicken menu with soup and French fries.  We were given number boards and the waiter came to us with steaming hot chicken in a few minutes. God! They had the best French fries that I have ever eaten. They were so soft and crunch and freshly made. Made me realize how bad the McD fries are. They also had sauce presses and had three kinds of sauces. I didn't know what each of them were but I liked the green one becoz of its tangy flavor. All the three sauces made the chicken even better. Soup was ordinary - big chunks of boiled chicken immersed in spicy water with boiled rice in it. I decided the next time, I will not order soup and instead go for flavored rice. The only complain I would have is that the chicken was a bit too much oily and feeling soaked of oil. It's Rotisserie chicken, can't help. My advice don't order anything more than a quarter chicken if you are a normal being"}
{"text":"This is my second review of a Viva chicken restaurant! Loved the ambience and the dim lights added such a warmth to the environment! The menu has a lot of incredible tasty and healthy options! I came here with my friends for dinner and ordered some fried rices and chicken with various sides. The juices were extremely colorful and a delight to drink rather than the regular coke and sprites. I loved the Green thingy concoction they call the herbal lemonade! The flavor from the mint  was freshly exhilarating! It didn't take long for the food to arrive at our tables and boy, they were hot and fresh - we dug in immediately giving no time for nature to cool off the tasty stuff! Added to that, the staff did remind us to pick up the three different sauces behind us and man, they raised the flavor to a whole new level now! Have to agree, We were tripping on food! 

Definitely recommend everyone to try this restaurant- especially if you are not from NC or Utah, cause currently Viva Chicken is blessing these two states only!"}
{"text":"The very best roasted chicken and the salads are perfect.  I can not say enough about how wonderful everything was.  The patio is also great.  This was our third time eating there and it is now a weekly destination.
Thank you."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not THAT great either! Seeing all these 5 star ratings I could be fooled to think this is the best restaurant in Charlotte -which trust me, it ain't!

Order at the counter,  eat out of paper plates with plastic utensils - they SUCK for carving roasted chicken- and....go, leave, please don't forget to clean after yourself!  In my book this type of establishment doesn't even qualify as a restaurant. Got no clue why people like places like these, assembly lines meant to get customers in and out asap, period.  

As for the menu ... well no seafood whatsoever, none - which is funny because seafood is really what makes Peruvian food shine and so different from it's neighbors. The chicken was an OK plump \"Peruvian flavored\" chicken, but not the best while everything else was totally Americanized. 

Normally the green hot sauce is so hot that I can only use small dabs of it, here they call it \"medium hot\" and I could gulp it by the spoonful. In fact I dumped the whole container on top of the tasteless Canary beans in order to be able to eat them.

The \"hot\" red sauce (aka \"gringo killer\" ) was mildly hot, not bad it went well with the chicken but it tasted a lot more like a hot BBQ than anything Peruvian. The sweet potato fries, again not bad but 100% American.

Not saying this place is bad, but it's like ordering from Pizza Hut, then claiming you've experienced great Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and the service is excellent.  Sometimes you have to wait a little while but that is just because they are busy!  We have ordered to go and eaten in the restaurant and the food is always amazing!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is the best spot for a quick meal! The food is so so good. The chicken is cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. They have special house made sauces to spice up your meal if you'd like too. All very tasty! For the most part everything is very inexpensive, and worth the price! Would strongly recommend. Vegetarian options as well!"}
{"text":"I was craving some spanish food and was recommended this place. It's absolutely delicious and definitely hits the spot. The chicken is very good and not dry at all. My only complaint is that the rice was a bit on the dryer side, but other then that, every side was very yummy. 

Also, the homemade juices are really good! So a definite must and their sauces! So so good."}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot offering healthy meals that fill you up for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Yuca trust this review. Ha..get it? Yu ca....you.....
Never mind.

That was the aim of my visit. Yuca fries. I couldn't imagine a Peruvian restaurant wouldn't serve them, so upon spying the restaurant after a most unpleasant trip to the hospital, I sought comfort food. Fried starchy comfort.

(I'm fine. Thanks.)

Walking in, it was busy with noticeably diverse customers. Queens University students, a few families, doctors, 3 hipsters, an elderly women's book club, some Wells Fargo employees. Don't know why that is noteworthy but it was noticeable; perhaps speaks to the wide market the place serves. Let's go with that.

Chipotle-y layout, plus a nice enclosed shaded patio. Approached cashier, who seemed new but was doing her best and was cheery & pleasant. (She recorded my name completely wrong. After a worker called throughout the restaurant for \"Savannah\" with the order, I figured as much.) Ordered a side of yuca fries. $3.90 or so. Ready in less than 5 minutes. Marvelous. Perfect. Fresh, thick and crispy, and the sauce was a perfect match. Yuca bet I'll be back."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place. Everytime I go I am so excited to try something new, and everytime I am more impressed. The chicken is awesome (don't forget to try their sauces) as well as the stuffed avocado and chicken soup. The fresh juice is also great, and something different that most places do not offer. Quick, easy and super tastey. I love Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"My best advice is to place a call ahead order in advance.  Lines can sometimes get a little bit out of control but that's a really quick way to get good food fast. I always opt for the quinoa stuffed avocado topped with rotisserie chicken, it actually makes my heart sing. I don't know how they do their quinoa but it is always cooked to perfection and the perfect addition to a half of a wonderfully ripe avocado. And make sure you order a side of fried plantains... those things are crazy delicious."}
{"text":"I LOVE Viva Chicken. It's slightly overpriced but quick service and great food. My absolute favorite is the quinoa stuffed avocado topped with rotisserie chicken. You can definitely get the half order and a side and feel full. My side of choice is the plantains. Extra delicious. It's super easy to get your food to go and you can always call ahead and your order is usually ready in less than ten minutes even during the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Had the Arroz Chaufa bowl with chicken. AMAZING!!! Flavor explosion. I must go back and try it all."}
{"text":"Awesome food, everything we got was really flavorful and you can taste the freshness!  Service is outstanding, it was our first time here and the staff was very helpful. Plenty of options for vegetarians as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Friendly! Fresh! Get the green beans as your side, so good! Love the yellow, red, and green sauces."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the chicken, Yuca fries and plantains. So good that I'm going back in a few hours for breakfast."}
{"text":"Maybe next time I need to order something more...saucy.  The chicken, plantains and yucca were good, but I think, living on the west coast, there seems to be more Peruvian in the Peruvian restaurants and the taste is in the sauce/ spice. I liked what I ordered, it was cooked exactly right - but I need to try again to get the give star effect (if I am ever in the area again).  I dined alone here so maybe a little more company would have helped.  I wanted to LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Aight check this out! I'm about to tell some mad truth so listen up....story goes like this: The other night I'm driving home from the mall, getting some new swag. Thought to myself \"hmm I'm hungry. I need something delicious, fast and healthy - VIVVVAAAA.\" I call in the order - 1/2 chicken with green beans and salad. Show up 7 minutes later, 8:58pm to be exact. They're closing...dang it, now I'm \"that guy\" calling in at closing wanting my food which technically will take longer to prepare than they have to close up, whoops. I thought they closed at 10pm and will not make that mistake again as no one wants to be \"that guy.\" Anywayyy I get my food, the essential delicious sauce, one of each of course, and head home. Wooooo hoooo hot Viva next to me, driving extra careful, precious cargo ya know, smell just tempting me, and knowing I'm only 5 minutes away from flava town. I get home open the bag and lay out the spread - oooo yeaaa I said in my Macho Man Randy Savage voice. BUT this is where stuff gets real....ready for this bullcrap (language I know, but i was upset).... in the bag was one of the most amazing dishes Viva has - ARROZ CHAUFA. Problem with this? My out of shape @$$ is eating low carb, hence the chicken and no carbs in the order. I was HANGRY! Dang you Viva you let me down. So I went to the website and told them in a polite way that i received the wrong food. 

I went on to eat my delicious green beans and salad, but this carnivore needed some meat so I picked out all the chicken in my arroz chaufa. Exactly 12 minutes later I get an email notification from Viva and I think to myself \"I'm not talking to you,\" I'm still upset that i'm eating the equivalent to Tweetie bird when I really wanted Foghorn Leghorn. I look at the email anyway and was stunned - the email was from the general manager. THE. GENERAL. MANAGER and not some automated nonsense reply, but an actual concerned response. I'll skip over the unimportant details of email here and there and get to the point of this 5 star review: Those awesome employees over at Viva actually gave me the correct items and I had ordered the wrong thing. I explained this over email and admitted my mistake to the general manager. Not only was he extremely helpful, polite, professional, personal, he made me love Viva that much more because of his professionalism and expectation of excellence. Needless to say I felt like an idiot, but I love Viva that much more. My only suggestion is to eat carbs and make good decisions...which eating at Viva is ALWAYS a good decision."}
{"text":"The chicken tastes so good, especially with their sauces.
Wish the sides were bigger ( plantains, yucca). They are very small but taste good."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: I'm a vegetarian. So this isn't catering to me. :)

The DESSERTS they have here are SO GOOD THOUGH. I especially like the passion fruit mousse, and these weird Peruvian chocolates that have caramel in them... ugh, decadent! 

The rice dish and plantains are also super yummy. Not my favorite Peruvian restaurant in charlotte, but I'll be happy to accompany my omnivorous chums if this is what they're craving."}
{"text":"Best Chicken in the Charlotte area!! Wish they would open one in Matthews!! We have tried several menu item and have never been disappointed!! Quinoa Avocado with Chicken still my favorite!! We like that they carry sparkling water!"}
{"text":"This place reminds of my fav DC/Maryland Portuguese chicken spot, Nandos! Taste was fresh, chicken well seasoned the sides of fried yuca and plantains were ON POINT! Note the hottest sauce while spicy is not scary, the flavor is robust. One of my favorite new to Charlotte finds."}
{"text":"aaaaaamazing!  I get into a groove here and want to go alllll the time!  The Arroz Chaufa with chicken is my go to with the awesome sauces!  The herbal limeade is good too!"}
{"text":"I'm seriously addicted to this place and so is everyone I've introduced to it. Please open a location in south Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Get the stuffed avocado and yuca fries for a well-rounded and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Hands down the best chicken I have ever tasted. The soup is amazing. The rice with cilantro is awesome. Quinoa stuffed avocados with chicken - delicious!"}
{"text":"Love love to their  avocado and quinoa dish. Found them after the taste of Charlotte street fair. Park in the lot in front to avoid the meter. The staff super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"This was our first stop on our road trip from ATL to NY.
When we got there, the line up was almost to the door, and I am glad to say this place well deserves 5 stars from me. Almost want me to start driving as I am writing this. haha;

My wife who usually goes chicken? what chicken? fell in love with this place. The seasoning was perfect and cooked perfectly.

The wrap was nice too and the sweet potato fries were to die for wife says, and I agree. They are crispy on the outside, and tender inside with right amount of salt to it.

oh and if you are getting a drink, make sure to try their herb lemonade. It'll make you wonder why you never thought about making a lemonade that way."}
{"text":"First time visiting, and glad I did! Everything was really yummy and the service was on point. I ordered the quarter chicken (dark) with the cilantro rice and canary beans. The cashier gave great recommendations, and had me try all the juice options. All were delicious, but the passion fruit really wowed me. If you are lucky enough to be in there when Cory is working, be sure to take his sauce recommendations. Not only does this guy excel at customer service, but he knows his way around flavor. Wonderful experience and I'll be sure to be back!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is soooo good!I have been here several times and have tried a variety of their items on the menu.  My favorite is the Tacu Bowl. The sauces top it off so well. I really enjoy their juices too.  They can be a little heavy so I would say make sure you eat enough of your food first so you won't get full off of the juice. The prices are decent too. I don't have a huge appetite so I'm always able to have leftovers from the Tacu Bowl.  I actually just saw the other day while driving they are opening another location near Concord Mills so that is exciting. Go grab a bite..you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Our office eats here often and the food is normally very good.  Because this location is busy we pick up instead of eating in. Today was not so good.  Soggy limp sweet potato fries that were obviously put in the cardboard carryout container under cooked and hot. The issue is when I called to get them to make it right all I got was excuses from the manager.  Then the only option he would give me is to come back in again tomorrow since we didn't want to drive back over just for fries.  Lacking in the basics of customer service."}
{"text":"Incredible food with a super friendly staff. Arguably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Think of this restaurant as the Peruvian Chipotle. Ingredients are fresh, chicken is free range cooked in a wood charcoal rotisserie and the sauces are amazing. Would highly recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone is extremely nice and the food and service is exceptional. Tacu bowl with chicken was fantastic with their hot sauce. Herbal limeade is refreshing."}
{"text":"I love the inca wrap. It goes great with the sauces, my favorite being the cilantro sauce. Also, would recommend the passion fruit juiceS"}
{"text":"I really think this place is great.  It's delicious real chicken with a plenty of fantastic and healthy side options that pair nicely! These are the types of places that I'd like to see more of because you are getting a great value for the price you pay.  Nothing fancy here but great chicken and sides so it's definitely a place you have to come try out.  The location in Elizabeth is a little small but the location on Park Road is perfect.  Love it and plan to come more regularly.  Don't forget to try the sauces here because they make the chicken even better!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for lunch or a quick dinner!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place. When I heard about the ballantyne location, I got very excited. They're service is always perfect and their food is exceptional. I love the stuffed avocado app. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"I got the 1/4 chicken and rice with sweet potato fries!  Wishing there was one in Marietta, Georgia!  Quick service too!"}
{"text":"We didn't feel like cooking, but we wanted something relatively close. I was actually searching Yelp for someplace that served a killer salad, and the first result was Viva Chicken. So...

The place is smaller than I thought, though the outdoor seating was closed for winter. At first glance, the menu looks a bit limited, but there's actually a good bit of variety. We got a whiff of the chicken and I decided that a salad would have to wait for another time.

We considered the quinoa avocado simply because it looked great, but my wife dislikes the peppers and I'm not a big avocado guy. We both decided on the quarter chicken (white meat) and two sides. She got the cilantro rice and yucca, and I had the plantains and green beans.

The plates, utensils - pretty much everything - is biodegradable or Eco-friendly. Which is great. Except the forks are a bit flimsy. Found it hard to wrangle the green beans... Our meals were brought to our table.

There is also a sauce bar, of a sort. We both went with the mild, garlicky stuff and it was strong and tasty. The chicken is Peruvian rotisserie style and has a unique, lively flavor without being spicy. Very very tasty, both the meat and the skin. My wife enjoyed the rice, but was smitten with the yucca. I found the plantains sweet, which made us wonder if they were fresh. They were good, though. The green beans were pretty good too, especially with the garlic sauce.

My wife had water. I sampled the herb lemonade, and liked it enough to order it. It was very strong and flavorful as well as refreshing. Could do with a bit more tanginess, but that's my opinion. I quite liked it as it was, and am picking nits.

The portions were fine, but we did think it was just ever-so-slightly more expensive than we expected. Our meal came in just under $25 for the two of us, but the food was excellent. And we were not alone. The other restaurant in the same building was nearly empty, while Viva Chicken was jumping. And the food certainly deserves the attention. Recommended for anyone in the area of CPCC or if you're in Uptown and don't mind a jaunt. Note that the streetcar stops right next to the place."}
{"text":"Super mundane and kind of boring. We went based on reviews and recommendations but there are a thousand better places to eat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is out of this world! You walk in and your options are chicken or more chicken.  I love a place that knows what they are good at! Joking aside the have salads as well but you can get the rotisserie chicken in quarter, half, or whole with sides. All the sides seem really good, I personally enjoy the plantain and yuca the best. If you have gone a few times and want to change it up the stuffed avocado is out of this world. Make sure you get to Viva chicken as soon as you can."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been amazing. Try the herbal lemonade. It gets super busy at lunch, however."}
{"text":"I love love love Viva Chicken!  My favorite is the chicken, cilantro rice, and green beans.  It is sooo good!  Also, the canary beans are good.  When I do not feel like cooking, it is so convenient to be able to call or go online to place my order.  The service is good and I can't wait until I can go visit Viva Chicken in Waverly. 

Lunch time on a week day can be a little busy, but the line moves pretty quick and you just have to be on the look out for an available table."}
{"text":"Knocking off a star because it's pretty pricy for the amount of food you get, and I'm not one to complain about pricing of food. However the food is phenomenal and very unique."}
{"text":"Great Peruvian chicken! Love this as a fast causal option in Charlotte! I highly recommend their salads as well as there chicken, which is what they are known for! Give it a try, you won't regret it! Awesome option that's budget friendly as well as delicious!"}
{"text":"I eat here basically every day so I figured I should give it a review. Everything is delicious. The serrana cobb salad is my go to. the Lime vinaigrette is AWESOME."}
{"text":"Viva Peru! 
I love the fact VC now has multiple locations. I can lunch here if at work or home thanks to that. 

If you are into Quinoa and having something healthy, definitely go for the Andina Power Food and add chicken. But honestly, you can't go wrong w any of the dishes."}
{"text":"It took me a little while to go in here... It's very close to my house, and therefore dangerous.

Those quinoa stuffed avocados though.... Amazing. It's the only thing I've had so far because I can't not order them.  The first time I got them I didn't change them at all, but I always add chicken. I think the balsamic is a little overwhelming, so now I order it without. And it's so good! I can't even explain it. Just the right size, filling, but about $10. So it is a little pricey, but delicious. 

The people are always very friendly and helpful here. It's a clear your own table kind of place, but someone always offers to take my plate for me and refills my little water cup."}
{"text":"The chicken salad is my favorite, with the yellow sauce as the dressing. The Yucca is fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. I got the quarter white meat, corn salad, and fries. The chicken here was so tender and full of flavor. My favorite thing is something that is perfectly seasoned. I was not disappointed. Their fries are perfectly done in the middle with a delicious coating and fried to perfection. The corn salad (there is a different name for it) was very earthy. It was ok. They have three sauces that are all to die for. Please check it out everyone!!"}
{"text":"One of the best fast casual dining places in charlotte! Good food, fast service and affordable."}
{"text":"Cheers for Viva opening in Concord and closer to me :) I was a little surprised to see Viva come this far north since Concord is not particularly known for diverse dining options. 

If you've been to a Viva Chicken before then you know the deal. Fast casual Peruvian restaurant known for its deliciously juicy rotisserie chicken and sauces. This location is located not too far from Concord Mills in the same shopping center as Lowes and Famous Toastery. There happens to be a Jason's Deli opening up next door soon so expect the already cramped parking lot to get even more busy.

I typically call in my order so that it's ready for pick up when I arrive. When the location was still freshly opened, the wait times got to be longer than I had time for so I just started calling in my orders.  Service has always been friendly and I appreciate that they read back your order to ensure accuracy.

The sauce station is where all of the magic happens, truly. There's usually a group of people huddled around pumping their favorite sauce into tiny cups. Personally, I'm a yellow and red fan. 

I usually rotate my favorites when ordering: the great wrap with avocado & jalapeno bacon, the naked Peruvian wrap, viva salad, or the quinoa stuffed avocados with chicken. I recently discovered that their chicken soup is so delicious and packed with all of the veggies and hearty pieces of chicken. It is sure to cure whatever may ail you."}
{"text":"Viva el pollo, my friends!

Viva is located in the charming little section of Elizabeth nearby Earl's Grocery. There are two parking lots - one right across the street and one that is a little further down the street. I met my best friend right after work (a little after 5:00) on a Thursday and had no trouble finding a park. 

When you walk in, you will be welcomed with the mighty aroma of Peruvian spices wafting off of the bounty of rotisserie chickens. It's walk-up/order-at-the-counter style. There are paper menus around the restaurant so you can grab one to look over while you wait (if there's a line) or a large menu right above the registers.

Since I had been looking forward to my Viva visit, I had already spent a good amount of time reading their menu online so I came in prepared and ready to order the quinoa stuffed avocados with pulled chicken and a sangria to drink.

Once you order, you're given a number and sent off to choose your own table. Since it was a nice evening, we grabbed a table on their patio which is enclosed with an array of potted and hanging plants. No sooner than a couple of minutes of us sitting down, our food was brought out to us.

I could tell from my first DELICIOUS bite of the avocado, that this dish was going to be quite filling. The avocados are topped with tomatoes and their house made sauces. It is literally a complete meal, even though it may not look like it. The sangria is amazing and something that I could happily drink a pitcher of without blinking an eye. It's served with orange and apple slices that are extra delicious after you've slurped down the sangria and they've soaked up the juice :)

Even though there's no typical waiter/waitress service, there are employees who come out to check in on your satisfaction and bring out anything else you may need to accompany your meal. Every single employee I encountered was extremely courteous and helpful.

Viva is Peruvian-inspired not completely authentic Peruvian food so don't come here with the latter in mind. What's most important is that the food and drinks are made with fresh ingredients, served efficiently and delicioiusly.

I happily volunteer as tribute to try every single Viva menu item between now and the end of the Summer."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while visiting a friend in Charlotte. I was a bit skeptical because of the amount of people. I didn't want it to be one of those places that was just over hyped. But the food was great. We ordered the stuffed guacamole, 1/2 chicken and yuca fries. All of the above were amazing. They have great service too. Even on a busy day (we had to hunt down a chair) they were attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  The food is delicious here!!  We always order the rotisserie chicken with plantains, salad, and cilantro-infused rice. It's always hot and perfectly seasoned.  The restaurant has a cool vibe, it's lively and almost always full. We usually get take-out and even when the food is reheated at home it tastes amazing. One of our favorite eateries. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing food! Rotisserie chicken and rice and fried yuca and plantains - perfecto!  Didn't try the other things but the whole menu looks amazing. Love that they have a lot of avocado in their dishes. The place was packed even at 4 in the afternoon. After eating there I could see why. Reasonable prices for amazing food. Fresh, seasoned perfectly and juicy chicken and sides were awesome!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm... 

The fella and I visited Viva Chicken after I heard about 37 different people proclaim it as their favorite place.  Even with high expectations, it didn't disappoint.  

As others have said, it's in the old Anderson's building right in front of Presbyterian Hospital, and parking was easy on a Wednesday night right across the street.  I was worried about seating, but there were easily enough tables to seat 30 or so people inside and even more outside on the cutest covered porch I've ever seen.  If it hadn't been 93 degrees outside, I would've tried it.

The minute we walked in the door, a guy behind the counter enthusiastically said hello and welcome and gave us the rundown on the menu.  The lady behind the register was super nice and gave us some good suggestions on what to order, so I got the rotisserie quarter-chicken (all white meat) with plantains and yucca and sangria, and the fella got The Great sandwich with fries and white wine,  which is stored in a tiny bottle in the mini fridge on the counter along with some desserts and other beverages.  (Trust me that this is super cute and not bizarre.)  

We took our number and our wine, found a table by the window and waited maybe 3 minutes til the food came out.  The chicken was hot and perfectly seasoned, and I had to force myself not to eat the plantains first; they were worth the wait.  The yucca was really good, but I'd never had it before, so I can't compare it to anything.  The two sauces it came with (on the side) were a little spicy for me, but the food didn't even need sauces.  Fella said the sandwich was really good and could've used more meat and less \"stuff\" (a.k.a. - lettuce, tomato and onions), but he's a serious carnivore, so that statement could be said about meat pie.

The prices are reasonable, the service is better than some fine dining establishments I've been to, and the food is to die for.  I can't wait to work my way through the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Short and simple: Viva Chicken is amazing! Their rotisserie chicken is awesome and the green sauce is out of this world. Great choice of sides. I like the fried yuca and green beans. I need to try more than their 1/4 chicken plate as I've heard their other dishes are pretty good too. The bowl is very filling also."}
{"text":"Been to Viva twice now and it is already one of my top recommendations to friends or out of town visitors. Their rotisserie chicken and excellent sides are quality at a very reasonable price. Ive had the 1/4 chicken plate with the Yuca fries and green beans as well as the chicken and rice bowl which was a TON of food.

Very modern and appealing interior or a shaded patio surrounded by plants and herbs.

Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"So disappointed because I love the Huntersville location. I ordered online and still waited in the restaurant 9 minutes past my pick up time. There were a lot of people in both the pick up/online and dine-in lines while only 1 person taking orders for each line. There were quite a few employees in front of house standing and not helping. Not the experience I like for a $14 meal, very unorganized and no established process from observations. Ive been here 2x since opening and both times experienced the same thing."}
{"text":"I got introduced to Peruvian chicken over 20 years ago in DC area.  Ever since, I consider Peruvian chicken as best of the best hands down.  


I had business trip to Charlotte so first thing I did was look up Yelp to see what's good in this town.  When I saw Viva with top rating, I had to try this.  

Good thing I did.  I ordered 1/2 chicken w two sides.   Gotta have my yuca and tried their rice. (They don't offer rice n beans like most of other Peruvian places).  I got all three sauces from the sauce bar, and waited for my food to come out

It was as advertised, and actually exceeded my expectation.  Chicken was crispy and juicy, sauces were all excellent.  Definitely deserves 5 stars.   Hope they open one in Jacksonville.  Now I got something to look forward to when I come up to Charlotte."}
{"text":"This was really good! My wife had the Quinoa stuffed avocado and she added chicken and I had the Arroz Chaufa! We paired the food with 2 of their signature juices: Herbal lemonade and the Maracuya! Mmmmmm this was insanely delicious! The service was amazing! It was packed as we went during the lunch rush (Noon) but the staff were all friendly! Very clean bathroom, clean restaurant in general, social buzz (people talking no cell phones)! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place is our go-to for lazy Friday nights or any day when we don't feel like cooking. The chicken quality is superb and the prices are very reasonable. I grew up in Washington, DC eating authentic Central and South American chicken, and this is just as good! We really like to eat a healthy and balanced diet, but don't always have the energy to cook. Viva Chicken lets us be lazy and still get healthy rotisserie chicken and delicious sides. 

Our favorite go-to is the whole chicken with three large sides. The salads come with amazing mixed greens, crumbled cheese, fresh cucumber, onion, and tomato and a not-too-sweet balsamic vinaigrette.  We also really enjoy the cilantro lime rice and the green beans which come with little pieces of red pepper. 

The three standard sauces are delicious too. There's one in there for every taste. (Mild, medium and hot.)

As a bonus, for those of us who care about these things (like me!) the chicken is all 100% natural and free range, and cooked every 45 minutes. Nothing is ever old or of low quality. For this quality of chicken, the prices are incredibly reasonable!

For the earth-friendly nuts (also like me!), the cutlery, plates, straws and cups in the restaurant are all 100% biodegradable, and their take-home containers are extremely durable and very reusable. We have a stockpile of them and use them to pack our lunches every day. They even survive the dishwasher, dozens of times over! :) (Free Tupperware?! Yay!)

If you eat at the restaurant, they have beer and wine, which is a very nice touch.

All in all, we have been there many times, and we plant to keep going back on a very regular basis."}
{"text":"The service? Wow! The food? Wow!

This place was fantastic and everything I had was delicious. The chicken was succulent and juicy, and every bite was bursting with flavor.

The sides were great as well, everything was hot and crispy and they also have Inca Cola which you don't see very often."}
{"text":"This is literally one of the best places in Charlotte. It may have been part of the reason I moved to Charlotte  would highly recommend everything on the menu. All items are good and delicious."}
{"text":"Loved having lunch here! 
My chicken was cooked perfectly and the cilantro rice side went with it perfectly. I'm not a huge sauce person, so I had the chicken plain and it was delicious. I also had the chicken soup, which I would pass on in the future since it had a lot of raw onions in it. However, Viva gets lots of bonus points for the cilantro explosion in the rice and soup-- love it!

Loved eating outside on their patio as well. Beautiful and delicious place to eat."}
{"text":"The perfect spot for a quick and delicious dinner! We've been there a number of times and have thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered - especially the quinoa avocado (with chicken), the Arroz Chaufa, and half a chicken. Portion sizes are pretty good as well - you definitely won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"So I have it 5 stars because it's the total package! Very reasonable prices and the guest service was above and beyond! The food was really good! I had the Arroz Chaufa ~ Fried Rice, Red Peppers, Green Onions, Egg, Red Onion, Peruvian Soy Sauce, Ginger. It was so delicious! Although I wish I had said no onion. The hormone free chicken with the fresh vegetables were just right! Everyone was super friendly and engaging. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! I eat here all the time and am always satisfied. And it is so fantastic that they have a plain white rice option! (Normally I do not order rice at South American cuisine because I hate cilantro.) The passion fruit punch is my favorite."}
{"text":"This is one of the most affordable Peruvian restaurants, it has many go to dishes available, but they don't do the ceviche here. Only chicken and steak, definitely try the Arroz Chaufa with chicken, or their signature starter, Quinoa Stuffed Avocados! The BOMB . COM"}
{"text":"We LOVE Viva Chicken but the Concord Mills location is a complete disaster.  We waited 50 MINUTES for a takeout order of 2 items.  There were many people waiting over an hour for their order.  Complete chaos."}
{"text":"This is my favorite quick bite restaurant in Charlotte. The decor and atmosphere are awesome. There is a great patio. The service is outstanding. But, the real reason to go here is the food. My go-to is the quinoa stuffed avocado, which I add chicken to and use the green \"medium\" sauce. I've never been disappointed. This place is a little crowded at lunch time, but, that is because it is sooooo good."}
{"text":"GOOD LORD. So good. So so good. I was actually reluctant to go here since I wasn't in the mood to start with another cuisine, but my friend convinced me it was *that* good, so I obliged. It wasn't terribly busy when we got there around 12:45 on a Monday. I had already decided to get The Great or The Inca with steak pending what the cashier's recommendation was. Before that could even happen, my friend said we could split the two, which was good with me.

I ended up with half of The Great on ciabatta and half of The Inca on ciabatta with yucca fries. We decided to eat outside. My friend's The Great came out way faster than my The Inca, but once they both came, we dug in. Something about both of the sandwiches was just really satisfying. Maybe it was the excellent meat (chicken was probably a bit better than the steak), maybe it was the great bread, who knows. It was just really freaking good. Then I discovered the sauce. Some of the best sauces I have ever tasted. Both the yellow and green sauces were out of this world. They went great with both of my sandwiches and the yucca fries. 

The service, as others have said, is phenomenal. Whether it's holding the door for you as you go outside or checking on you as you eat, they know service. Way to go. 

I found myself craving Viva right after I left which I take as a great sign. I think I'll head back for lunch today. Just fantastic all around."}
{"text":"I've already written a 5 star review for the Viva Chicken in Ballantyne, but now I will write one for this Viva Chicken after my recent visit. Plain and simple it's just really freaking good.

Went for lunch on a weekday and it was packed. Almost a bit disorganized, but the line moved quickly and a table opened up on the patio. I got The Great sandwich like usual, adding bacon and avocado. And like usual, it was incredible. Tender, flavorful chicken, great bread, and the toppings all added something to the sandwich. The yellow sauce is absolutely out of this world and the green sauce is pretty darn good, too. Yucca fries were excellent as they always are.

The staff is always checking on your table and offers to refill water and clear plates--always super friendly. Parking was easy across the street in a lot. While I doubt I'll come back to this location anytime soon, I'll be at the one in Ballantyne as much as I can."}
{"text":"I love Viva Chicken--see any of my other reviews (Elizabeth, Ballantyne, Huntersville) and you will know I'm not lying. This location; however, has been a swing and a miss two out of two times for me. The employees are friendly, restaurant has a great ambiance, but the food is worse than the other Viva locations. Today it was some cartilage in my The Great sandwich, and last time the chicken was pretty bad as well. 

You'll still get a good lunch here, but the quality control needs to be stepped up to match the amazingness that is the other locations."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Have been here 2 days in a row. First night had the chicken and I will never make chicken again- The best. Today Andina Salad and it was over the top fantastic. The yellow sauce is my fav. Husband loves the spicy orange one. YUM"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is always top notch and the service is the best. We were waiting for a to-go order and some nice young man came over and asked us if we would like some water. You have to try the plantains - they are the best:)"}
{"text":"I don't eat a lot of chicken these days, but after reading positive reviews of Viva, and driving by it on may way home from work most days and smelling the wonderful aromas wafting from their kitchen, I had to give it a try.  I was hooked.  Moist, moist chicken, fantastic canary beans (which I'd never heard of), and decent lime-cilantro rice.  

I had carry-out, which I would likely do again since I live only a short distance from there, and the seating looks like it fills quickly.  Looking forward to my next Viva Chicken meal."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is totally one of my favorite places in Charlotte. I love everything about them. Their food is amazing. They have super friendly service a Amazing food + friendly service + awesome value = 5 stars! I'm a pollo a la brasa junkie... Something about the seasoning and slow roasting just makes that chicken irresistible. Add the Huacatay & Roasted Rocoto Sauce and I'm in heaven! The quarter chicken plate ($7.95, $5.95 for lunch!) is more than enough food for me. I love the sweet potato fries and salad. The feta cheese and sweet/tangy dressing make the salad. I would highly recommend trying the purple corn punch and the passion fruit punch. Both are delicious! They also serve beer & wine. Parking is free and plentiful across the street. I can't wait to explore more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Very Good quality rotisserie chicken, but SALTY-SALTY-SALTY!!!!  Drive on to Harris Teeter for similar quality at less than 1/2 price and WITHOUT the blood pressure spike!"}
{"text":"Came here and loved everything about it. It reminded me of a better a Pollo Trapical back in South Florida. It was quick to order and receive our food. Service was great and we loved the food. 

I had the roasted chicken, rice, and sweet plantains. Food was hot, fast, and good. She had the same but had green beans with her's which was really good too. 

I really enjoyed the service and food, so this will definitely be a place we will come back to again and again"}
{"text":"Avocado and chicken is excellent!

It is stuffed with quinoa and has a balsamic vinegar drizzled on top.

It's kind of like sushi in the sense that you can eat a lot and at no point do you feel disgustingly full.

Pretty healthy menu as well!"}
{"text":"Ate at Viva Chicken on a business trip and it was something that stands out during my 5 days in Charlotte. Good food and good service."}
{"text":"Full and happy after my first visit to Viva Chicken!
I decided to play it safe with a \"The Great\" sandwich on multigrain ciabatta (nice touch) and yucca fries.  I'm usually more adventurous.  But Viva can even make a chicken sandwich really wonderful, hence the name...Yucca fries were hot, crispy and not greasy.  They must keep their fryer at the right temperature - something busy lunch restaurants are often challenged with.
It's a counter order place where they give you a number and deliver your order.  I'm a little weary of this service style, but whatever works.  They were busy, and it didn't take long at all for our food to be delivered.  Employees are friendly and helpful.
I plan to try more of the menu soon.  
Now that you've read how I can go on and on about a (anything but) simple chicken sandwich, don't you want to try Viva too? :)"}
{"text":"Healthy, fast, good, and reasonably priced... All things I like in a restaurant. I pretty much order the same things - chicken with the gringo killer hot sauce, green beans, and plantains. I could eat it all the time. Everything is flavorful yet simple. I also like the canary beans. This is a family friendly place, too, as it's very casual. If it's nice outside, the patio area is very quaint for a cheap dinner date."}
{"text":"Wow. Our friends suggested we meet for dinner here before a show at the Visulite, and, not knowing a thing about Peruvian anything, I was a bit hesitant, hoping I'd find something I would know what it was. I took a chance on the Inca Wrap, with chicken added, and holy moley! It was so delicious. I got the Yucca as a side (not knowig what Yucca was either - yeah, sheltered life I suppose) and apparently the dipping sauce was supposed to be for the Yucca, but I thought it went on the wrap, which actually made it even more delicious. It was such a large wrap I only ate half and hubby got to have the other half for lunch the next day. He said even cold, it was amazing. I can not wait to go back! Only 4 stars right now until I try everything else. Friendly and quick service, too. Highly recommended, although I don't know why I'm sharing what should be my new \"secret\" go-to spot. Now there is another reason to go to shows at The Visulite Theatre!"}
{"text":"Ready? Here's a quick rundown of my experience here. I walk into this joint with my girlfriend and best friend, as this is yet another one of the \"places to try in Charlotte,\" and the smell of this place just smacks me in the face! Very few times in my life have I smelled something this delicious upon entry. 

After looking at the menu for all about 2 minutes, I knew I had to try the soupa de pollo. I'm handed a number and head on over the the drink station, where I run into Yaneth - an employee of the restaurant. As I went to fill my glass with pink lemonade, Yaneth tells me to stop! Because I'm dating a Spanish woman, I know better than to act as if I never heard her and continue filling my cup. She reaches over and makes me fill the other half of the cup with water, then proceeds to add a small collection of lemons. Speaking through my girlfriend in Spanish, she tells me to try this. Man... This stuff was delicious! Very light, but had just enough sweetness. 

So, the waitress comes out and trades us our food for the number on our table about 10 minutes after ordering and our feast begins. My girlfriend had the Amazon Cesar salad and gave it two thumbs up. My buddy, Andina power food, which he literally inhaled. Let's just assume that was a good thing.  My food... Well, I scooped a heaping spoonful of the chicken soup from the bowl and shoved it in my mouth. I'm certainly glad I did, as it was bar none the best soup I've had in a long while - possibly ever! A caramel filled churro complimented my soup quite nicely for desert. 

Keep doing what you're doing, Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food...
Facility extremely too small for lunch crowd!!! Most every time I walk up to entrance door, someone is stating they are leaving due to not enough seating to support crowd!!"}
{"text":"Have tried about half of the menu across several visits and everything has been top notch! The combinations are simple, yet delicious and eloquently prepared. The only downside is that it is a little on the expensive side, otherwise I would be back more often."}
{"text":"I had the tacu bowl with all white chicken and it was amazing!! The ingredients were so fresh. I didn't need to add sauce. This was my first time trying this and I'll definitely be back. Now i see why this place is so popular. The food is amazing and so is the staff!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! Any location I've been to has been amazing. It was busy when I came in on Wednesday to place a to go order. However, the cashier was smiling and the staff was efficient. The restaurant was clean and the food was fresh. I order the tacu bowl with pulled chicken and it was amazing! The flavors meshed extremely well together, that I didn't need the sauce. However, when you eat at VIva, you have to get the sauce! I am a customer for life!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty but the attention to detail is lacking. I ordered a wrap with chicken only to bring the order home with no chicken added. It's the entire reason to come to viva chicken is the delicious Peruvian chicken so now I suggest you only order food that you can see if they got right without needing to unwrap anything"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. The chicken is full of favor and cooked perfectly. If you are seeking a place that is healthy, try them. There 3 flavors of sauce compliment any meat selection."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is one of my families favorite places to grab food. We love to grab the Viva Chicken Salad or the Viva Taco Bowl. I think that's what they are called? However they are so delicious! You have to get their sauces though! It makes the meal!! If you order them off of Postmates then you have to specially ask for a variety of their hot sauces. They are really yummy and they pull the meal together and make it unique. Its what I love about the place. It is also relatively healthy for eating out compared to most grab and go restaurants. Every dish is based with rotisserie chicken! They really do make it really well, and rather healthy too. Don't forget the sauces, though. That's the best part!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It is a very popular lunch spot, so get there early or wait for a table.

The quinoa stuffed avacados were yummy as well as the 1/4 chicken with 2 sides. I love their cilantro rice with the green sauce as well as the side salad. Really everything here is delish!"}
{"text":"So Fresh! Very friendly staff. Fried yuca was so soft, not over fried. The quinoa stuffed avocado was delicious. Chicken was very tender and juicy. Get the medium sauce!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken was so great! I showed up during lunchtime and the place was busy, which is a really good sign. I usually take a look at other peoples faces when they are eating and it was smiles all around. Got my food pretty quickly after I ordered and enjoyed my delicious meal. Will be back!"}
{"text":"There was a lot of buzz about this place that recently opened and now I understand why.  I had the quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken & it was DELICIOUS!!!  Listed as an appetizer but definitely will fill you up as a meal.  My Husband got The Great sandwich and loved it just the same.  Fresh, unique tastes and excellent service!!!  5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets in Charlotte for roasted chicken. Everything on the menu is so fresh and unique. All the sauces are wonderful too. Don't be afraid to try the \"hot\" sauce. It's a green sauce that is soooo good on everything. 

The sides are wonderful too. If you get the fried plantains or yucca I suggest getting them slightly well done so they're super crunchy on the outside while still being tender on the inside. My WHOLE family loves the chicken and fries for lunch (even my very picky daughter). For about $6 you get 1/4 chicken, fries (or side) and a drink. Not only is it a value, but considering most of the serving utensils are recycled/bio and the food is FRESH with a capital F, it's a miracle they can stay afloat. 

For an extra Peruvian feel, sit outside in the \"garden\" while you dine."}
{"text":"New location that just opened up. My little family have been a couple of times and service has been great each visit. We went during dinner rush and the line looked long but moved fairly quick. I do appreciate the quick service and quality food as well as their eco-friendly dinnerware.

Must try the Maracuya (Passion Fruit Juice)!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited Viva Chicken for the first time last night.  We both loved it!  We both ordered the quarter chicken with two sides.  The chicken was soooo good.  It didn't need any of the sauces.  I ordered the corn salad and sweet potato fries.  They were both good.  My daughter ordered fruit and green beans.  she wasn't crazy about the green beans.  She doesn't like \"crunchy\" green beans :-).   But, they have plenty of sides to choose from.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Viva Chicken has something for everyone with their variety of dishes and sides. Don't miss out on their sauces!"}
{"text":"Food is really good but a little pricey. Love the sweet potato fries. Churros are ok (stale, I think) which is a little disappointing, Costco's churros are better. Only issue when it's busy the line goes really slow and can take a while to get thru to place an order. Parking is virtually nonexistent the way it is set up."}
{"text":"I mean .... Avocado & chicken.... yes please! This is one of my favorite lunch spots. I usually stick with the stuffed avocado (+ chicken) which is a belly full of happiness. Add a tiny bit of the yellow sauce to it to make it a little guilty. The sopa de pollo is fresh and full of flavor plus the size is more than enough to feed 2-3 people. Green beans have a great kick and the cilantro rice is also incredibly fresh. I would eat there daily if I wasn't worried I'd turn into an avocado!"}
{"text":"LOVE Viva Chicken! The flavors are authentic and delicious. Menu also features chaufa arroz (Fried rice, Peruvian-Chinese style), roasted chicken with sauces (e.g. aji sauce), quinoa, drinks like Maracuya and Chicha Morada, and alfajores (cookies). 

Viva Chicken, in my opinion, would be perfect if Chicken Aji, one of my favorite Peruvian dishes ever, was on the menu. Go! It's good!"}
{"text":"First timer at Viva and everything was awesome.  Great atmosphere and food.  Polite and attentive staff.  Overall great casual experience with unique and flavorful food."}
{"text":"I have been eating here too often to get around to writing a review. Viva Chicken's reputation is well deserved; delicious food in a comfortable environment with a neighborhood feel.

No need to be intimidated at first glance when you see Peruvian. Viva Chicken does a great job making the menu feel very familiar. Any trepidation will quickly vanish once the smell reaches you in the parking lot. 

I have made my way through most of the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The taco bowl is one of my favorites as I am a sucker for pickled onions; and Viva knows how to pile on the onions. The serving is large enough that I always make two meals out of it. 

Try everything once and discover your favorite. Each item has its own favors, making it a great place to frequent. 

If all this wasn't great enough, they also serve some tasty sweets and juices. Also, Elizabeth creamery is just a block away - get some ice cream after your meal and enjoy a walk through Elizabeth."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food, the bomb! Drinks,  the bomb! Customer service, the bomb! Oh, I almost forgot , the steak is too chewy...don't get the steak."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!
Before coming here, I had not had Peruvian Food. But, how can you go wrong with rotisserie chicken? I usually get the 1/4 chicken and vary the sides. It is always enough food for me and I'm a pretty sizable guy. However, there is always the 1/2 chicken too if you are really famished. The two sauces (I only know them as green and yellow) are both delicious and unique. Great for dipping chicken or fries into or pouring over your rice.
The stuffed avocados with chicken are incredible and worthy of an appetizer to try or get two and make it a meal.

Now, here is why I give them five stars. I came one time with my family and my mum brought her guide dog. They asked a few questions regarding the dog being in the restaurant. Being protected by the ADA and having several non-accommodating encounters over the years, we were not in the mood for a fight and politely but abruptly answered their questions and then went to sit down.
A few minutes later they brought out a dog dish with water and gave us two treats for the dog for later because they understood he was working. We were blown away. Their questions, while bizarre in presentation, were actually trying to determine if it was appropriate to give the dog a treat. In 32 years, I cannot think of one restaurant that has ever done that for my mum. I have been in several where they just pet the dog without asking or try to secretly throw it a scrap or sit us out of the way or flat out try to refuse service. But never this.

And their customer service did not just shine then. Every time I've been in there, the staff is friendly, and seems to always do at least one thing that I'd consider above and beyond most places.

I'd go back for their food alone, but they are one of those places that simply deserve to be a lifelong staple n the Charlotte restaurant community."}

When I checked in, I commented \"I got here as soon as I could!\" I did not know it was opening day until I got to the register and thought it had been open a week or two. I usually avoid openings because so much can go wrong and the lines are too long. I'm really okay with delayed gratification.

That all being said, they were flawless in their opening which indicates to me this place is going to thrive with high quality and delicious food. I've reviewed their original location and am no stranger to their food. I will be a regular at this closer location."}
{"text":"I've been seeing this place in St George for a couple of years now and finally tried it today. I thought it was kinda pricey when I looked at the menu, but let me tell you, it was worth every penny. I've always loved the crazy chicken guys, but this place is definitely a cut above. Absolutely delicious. The best part was that the chicken breast wasn't dry. Moist and tender, unlike the other guys. I can't wait to go back again. I don't know what it's marinated in, but it sure is good!"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a healthy lunch. I had a small salad-quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken over romaine. It also had diced red bell pepper and a basaltic dressing. (The small order comes with half an avocado, the large order comes with both halves). The house sauces were delicious. I liked them all but particularly enjoyed the gellow pepper sauce and the green sauce with its unique blend of mint and cilantro. Very clean restaurant with a nice atmosphere. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is too good. This is not a place to pass up. You have not had this stuff before. The chicken is awesome. I cover mine in green sauce. No idea what that stuff is, but it is spicy and delicious. The cilantro rice, the fried plantains, and the canary beans are my go-to sides. The green beans are good too. It's not pricey, but not super cheap either; bottom line is that it's worth the money. I usually order a quarter chicken and two sides, plenty of food (but it is so good you may want more). Also, the patio is pretty cool with the plants growing around it and all. The staff is nice and friendly. It's not far from Uptown and is good for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place is frickin' awesome! They have some rockin' chicken options and the rice and beans we had a side with the fried plantains were all great. I would recommend this place to anyone who is interested in truly authentic tasting, fresh food for a great price.  The restaurant itself is also really cute. The outside eating area is super-nice and has some very pretty planters. If we're ever in Charlotte again, we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I really like Viva Chicken. I think the food is fresh and very tasty and the seasonings are great. I normally get a chicken with the green sauce and vegetables. This place is usually packed so it can be hard to get a table. But its definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place may not seem very vegetarian friendly with a name like Viva Chicken, but there are definitely vegetarian options - to my delight. 

Every time I've been here I've ordered the Viva Tacu Bowl. It's that good. (I have heard good things about the meat dishes from my omnivore friends, so if that's your thing - then I'm sure you won't be disappointed)

If you've never been here, heads up - it's more of a fast casual place (opposed to a more traditional 'sit- down' restaurant) and the prices fortunately reflect that."}
{"text":"How have I never been here?!?!  This was the best meal I have had in and around charlotte in forever!  All night long I just kept thinking \"wow!  That was delicious!\"

I loved EVERYTHING that we ordered. The plantains were unbelievable-perfection!  
And the prices were so reasonable. 

I'll be back at least once a week!"}
{"text":"So I wasn't in the mood for Mexican but I wanted a healthy meal and something different so I chose Viva Chicken. This is a casual dining restaurant where you order at the counter and bring it to your table once it's ready. 
They specialize in rotisserie chicken that is marinated for 24 hours and then cooked over charcoal. They have great flavor and it the chicken doesn't take like your local grocery's rotisserie chicken. They also have real good sides I normally get the green beans and the canary beans they with rice. The beans also have great flavor. Also for those who are health conscious the chicken is hormone free. 

On my most recent visit I had the Rice stuffed avocado (it's actually the Quinoa stuffed avocado but I'm not a fan of quinoa so I had them substitute it with rice) this taste just like a burrito bowl and was really delicious. They have 3 sauces that you can use to put on your meals and they just like the stop light red for hot , green for kinda and yellow is mild and my favorite. I used the Yellow with a splash or green ion my stuffed avocado. 
They also have daily made beverages including herbal limeade, and maracuya made from passion fruit juice."}
{"text":"You must eat here. 

I teach at CPCC, steps away from this fabulous gem of a restaurant, so this is my go-to place for late afternoons at work when I realize I have absolutely nothing to feed the cherubs. 

I usually order the same thing ... I confess. A whole rotisserie chicken with a double side of yucca. Sometimes I order an additional side of plantains. Always I crack open the fried yucca to sustain me on my long ten minute drive home... The sauces are amazing. 

The food has been delicious every time. One day, I'm going to hang out and test out the sangria! It looks so, so, good. My sitter is Peruvian and a Peruvian chicken connoisseur - this is her hands-down favorite CLT restaurant for rotisserie chicken. She eats here often and brings her college friends and chit chats in Spanish with the friendly owners and staff. This place is the real deal. So happy to have it close by!"}
{"text":"This place amuses me at the most. A lot of meals here are served (without Chicken)??? 
So, why do they call it Viva Chicken, yet you have to actually Add Chicken? Other folks I know have saidcthe same thing. Why not just call it \"Just Add\" Viva Chicken? Anyways, everything I've had here has been great."}
{"text":"First time visiting. I ordered the half chicken with the cilantro rice and yuca with green beans. I also ordered a glass of sangria. The chicken was simply outstanding, the reviews for once were spot on. There is only one chicken better than this one and it is located in San Juan, Puerto Rico by the name of Bebos BBQ. However, this chicken is definitely something especial. 

The green beans and the cilantro white rice were also tasty. The sangria not so much. One of the worse I had in a long time. The service was simply outstanding, the atmosphere was perfect and the areas including the bathroom kept clean. I'll be back! Great job guys!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say??? I love Viva Chicken and their customer service. I always order the wrap and sweet potato fries.

Clean, consistent, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"First timer here! I got an order to go and it was amazing! I ordered the Arroz Chaufa (Peruvian fried rice) and I added rotisserie chicken into it. I also tried a side of plantains, the herbal limeade and I also ordered the tres leches cake. Everything was good!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. A lot of people said it was really good, but I was skeptical because of the name. It's like panera in that you order at a counter and a food runner brings it to your table.  The food comes out quickly and is full of flavor. I tried the sopresito, something I've never heard of or had before.  If you are looking for a side,  I highly recommend it! 

I also love that the cups, plates, and cutlery are made from recycled materials!"}
{"text":"Very crowded at lunchtime but we found a table. Very interesting and delicious menu items with quick service. Enjoyable experience"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are a rip-off.  Hardly any meat but lots of bread. The chicken is a much better deal if you want to pay close to $15 bucks for a half chicken and drink. I'm glad I went, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place, avocados are so delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch food. The inca wrap is spot on. The sweet plantains are TOO good for take out. I still can't believe it."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they first opened in 2013!  The Tacu bowl with the green sauce and their fries are fantastic!  Also try the Chica morada juice and the passion fruit juice! So refreshing!"}
{"text":"THE BEST CHICKEN! I could drink the sauces they have, especially the green one! And the quinoa stuffed avocados- TO DIE FOR!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much I spent some time on my birthday here. Chicken is DELICIOUS. Sauces are AMAZING. I've also ordered take-out from here numerous times and never had an incorrect order or cold food. The fruit juices they make are really tasty as well."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! My husband and I tried this place after seeing the great reviews on Yelp. We had no idea it was an order at counter type of place and thought it was a sit-down waiter service type of restaurant. Loved it so much we have been back almost once a week and brought our children. Although it is order at counter type of establishment, the employees will come check on you and take away empty dishes. Food is great! We are not vegetarians but are trying to eat less meat so our favorite dish is the Audualian (sp?) salad. It has quinoa and avocado. Their sweet potatoe fries are crispy, fresh, hot , yummy!! Their roasted chicken is tender, seasoned well, delish! The place is always crowded and we know why. The value is great. A family don't have to break their bank to have a nice delicious meal with family. My mouth is watering as I'm writing this review. Love their drink choices too! Great job! You raised the bar for other eateries. Open more Viva Chicken, PLEASE!!"}
{"text":"Everyone suffers from an indecisive battle when it comes to what you should eat from time to time. Fresh, clean, and fast. Viva Chicken is always a good choice! Easily one of my all time to go places.

*Arroz Chaufa (Peruvian fried rice)"}
{"text":"Awesome! Love Viva Chicken. Fun and funky with great menu and fun staff!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Viva Chicken (and here it comes) BUT I had a pretty poor experience here on Friday 12/9.  I ordered a Caesar with chicken and a friend ordered the stuffed avocados, no chicken.  We end up having food brought out that was incorrect for both of us, two employees came out at separate times to ask again for what we ordered and it was eventually brought out just for me to notice I still didn't get chicken on my salad.  I hated asking the guy for the chicken but it is what it is and it was eventually all corrected and the manager brought out a juice for each of us.  Nice gesture, just 20 minutes that had I been with someone else could've felt like an eternity! Anyways, I'll obviously keep going!"}
{"text":"I came here during lunch on a weekday and it was packed! The line went all the way back and around to the sauce station. This was due to only one person taking orders. So be prepared to wait unless you ordered online or called in ahead of time. There's a separate register for that. I saw many people do that and it seemed like a good alternative. 

After ordering, the food surprising came out pretty fast. I got the taco bowl which is pretty good. A bit too much red onion on top and a lot of beans. My mom got the 1/4 chicken with cilantro infused rice and sweet potato fries. She said the chicken was really dry and the sweet potato weren't fresh like they had been out for awhile but she did enjoy the rice. 

There's not many parking spots in front of Viva Chicken but plenty surrounding the building beside it. I've seen many people park over there and walk to Viva."}
{"text":"Great Place for a quick bite. Very casual slow food. Did have a lot people for a 3:30 Sunday Afternoon. I ordered 1/4 chicken white meat + 4 sides. I enjoyed the yuca fries and soup the most. Additionally, the sweet potato fries and green beans were good options as well. The chicken was particularly flavorful and juicy. I enjoyed the \"hot\" sauce which had a kick+ bit of cilantro but wasn't truly hot. Would definitely recommend as something quick. I ordered out and it was ready promptly upon my arrival. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"One of the best rotisserie chicken spots in Charlotte! Huge portions for me is always a good start. I enjoyed the cilantro rice along with the platens. I would like to see more spicy sauces. Other than that I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. And it was great. The food was delicious , staff was friendly and place was clean. Prices are fair. I will def be back!"}
{"text":"I am ever-passionate about Peruvian chicken. I grew up eating the tenderly roasted delicacy and consider myself a true pollo rico fan. While I'm more accustomed to authentic, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, I was pleasantly surprised by the Viva Chicken approach. 

Seemingly out of a cool California operation, with its eco-chic interior and practices. Celebrating sustainable and recyclable practices, Viva seems to care about its impact on the environment and clearly has a heart too. On a select weekday night, they'll feed someone in need for free.  

To acquire some of the best chicken you're bound to ever eat, simply place your order at the counter and then patiently wait for your take out or dine in (should you choose to stick around, there's indoor and patio seating available). I opted for the pollo a la brasa (1/4 white meat) and 2 sides (cilantro infused rice with canary beans). While it plays host to fast food ordering, the dishes taste anything but rushed. For a mere $7.95, I dove in to my meal and compare it to the best of places I've visited. Were I to call myself a Charlotte resident, Viva would be in regular rotation."}
{"text":"A couple of friends recommended Viva Chicken.... it was so good. I had the 1/4 chicken and salad. The sauces with the chicken were like crack, the chicken was juicy and good. I could have probably eaten a whole chicken. The salad was a nice mix of lettuces, very fresh with a good tangy dressing. But the chicken stole the show. It is addictive. 
The service was very quick and polite. The restaurant itself is cute, I got carry out."}
{"text":"The food is so good! I was a little skeptical by just looking at the menu but I decided to give it a try anyway. The food is delicious. The ingredients are fresh, service is great. The only bad thing is the restaurant itself is a little small. Other than that, great place!"}
{"text":"OMG THE SALADS!!!!! I had no real idea what to expect. I mean it's a salad, right? The Andina Power Food Salad (add rotisserie chicken) is fantastic... the tropical dressing is delicious. I was working in Charlotte for the weekend... i ended up buying two more salads before I left town. I will be back for sure. Tried the stuffed avocado, plantains and churro. PS the salads are HUGE!!!"}
{"text":"We always order the Family Style/ Whole Chicken with 4 sides. The cilantro-lime rice, yuca, plantains, and quinoa stuffed avocado.  All of their sauces are yummy. Love their green ginger-mint lemonade. Always consistent with service and food."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today - ordered online for pickup at 1pm. Got there around 12:50, waited 10 minutes at the take out register before someone even showed up. Got my order and left. Turns out my Inca wrap is cold, I got plantains instead of sweet potato fries and got 2 sauces I didn't order (ordered hot and the green sauce) and both sauce cups weren't even half full. Not sure I'll go back and definitely won't be visiting during lunch rush. Only positive is the sauce I got is actually good but I miss the green sauce. I can imagine the wrap is really good if its warm.

Edit: raising to 5 stars because I replied to my confirmation email about the mix up and they called immediately to resolve it. Lunch rush happens - might just stick with dinner next time."}
{"text":"I was there this week twice..awesome food...taste great...and a cool staff ....great job with this new location...dish that you should try stuffed quinoa avocado. .Yummy"}
{"text":"I live for the Lomo saltado here!!! Fresh ingredients and very consistent quality. Don't even get me started on the green sauce!!! If you've never been, it's order at the counter style and also offers carry out."}
{"text":"When the parents of my mentee said they wanted to take me and the family for supper, I quickly determined that lunch would be better as that is my 2nd biggest meal and that I'm preparing for a competition.  With that, I knew Viva was my choice. 
Not only is the food awesomeness,  I can actually partake in eating something!  My choice was 1/4 white chicken with quinoa and canary beans.  If you're like me, you like beans that are full of flavor, and the canaries were sauteed with some garlic and other seasoning that just worked well.  The quinoa was flavorful, but cold;  I would've preferred them served warm, but still,  very tasty.
You can expect quick service and reasonable prices.  My dish was 8.95 for example. 
Also, they offer specialty drinks. My favorite is a corn and cinnamon based drink (the purple one) but the passion fruit is the more popular,  but I don't think you can go wrong with either. Their fried rice with chicken, eggs, and onions is very good. 
The seating is ample with and outdoors area.  This place staffs friendly workers and two separate members of  management stopped by and checked in with us. This is a must try if you're in the area for great chicken, service, and prices."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  My son took a bite of \"the great\" and you would have thought he'd never eaten food before.   I had the chicken salad and it was very good, the presentation seemed old on first take as the balsamic dressing was rather clumpy and the lettuce was just a huge mound of just lettuce with a few feta cheese pieces but again very good taste overall."}
{"text":"While this place is more 'faster' service, it does not taste like fast food at all.  The rotisserie chicken and avocado stuffed with quinoa is soo tasty and fresh. 

Corn salsa side with feta hit the spot. 

They also have good fried rice that u can add chicken to. 

Would not recommend the yucca fries as they seemed more frozen, breaded to fried style and not like a real yucca that u bake or fry. 

I hear the plantains are good if you like the sweet plantains. 

This place has patio and inside seating and looks like they are expanding next door."}
{"text":"Great place! Great food! Great customer service! Especially that one guy named Dennis. Was refilling our drinks and cleaned up our table. Very outgoing staff! Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I ordered two meals and two juices to go. Got home (25min away) and one of the meals was missing. I called and they said my only options were to come back for it or have them write my name down for a future in store credit. 

I don't live downtown so this is equivalent to keeping my meal and my money for months. Managed could not partially refund money without card present. This was July 1, here we we in September and I still haven't been back to that area 

The food is good otherwise. Check your to go orders before you leave 

Update. The management sent me two $5 gift cards in the mail so that I could come in at will to get my meal. Happy with that, glad they care to make customers feel cared for. Finally came in to use it 10/2017"}
{"text":"Just fantastic.    So good.  So filling.  Such great service.   Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"This place is good. I got the Tallarin Saltado, which is a linguine/veggies/soysauce/ginger dish, and it's delicious. And very filling
Plus, they have Eco-friendly everything: Cups, plates, napkins, even eating utensils!! Super awesome ^_^"}
{"text":"A place of vegetarians! Yay!! So I was visiting for the weekend and my cousin told me about this really good place that's better than Chipotle so I told her \"I'm down to try it.\" There's a lot of healthy options like sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc. I ordered the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado which is basically two avocado halves stuffed with quinoa and red peppers on a bed of lettuce with a chipotle mayo drizzled on top. For a drink, I ordered the Maracuya which is a Passionfruit infused. The cashier thought I said I wanted a sample so she gave me one! Yay for not ordering a full drink if I happened to not like it! I ended up sampling all three which were the Herbal Limeade (Basil Infused) and the Chicha Morada. If you're not into cinnamon and cloves, don't order. I preferred the Maracuya over them all. We took our food to go and once I got back home, I devoured it. Super lite meal. Oh, and the Yuca fries are good. Didn't order them but I stole some of hers. It's even better when you dip it in the yellow sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"My dining mate in I had lunch at this  Peruvian   chicken restaurant.
 It was very busy at lunch time. One  orders at the counter and then gets a table and waits for their order brought to the table. Atmosphere comfortable.
 The restaurant features chicken which is hormone free, marinated 24 hours with Peruvian spices and then cooked in a charcoal oven.
 The menu not only features their chicken with several sides but also a variety of salads soups , sandwiches and wraps plus a  kids menu. Even vegetarians will find something on the menu.
  A nice variety of sides which feature: green beans, canary beans,  rice ,sweet potato fries, French fries  quinoa,  plantains   yuca, chicken soup , house salad and fresh fruit.
 Prices are reasonable, food is plated attractively ,comes out hot with good portion size.
 We ordered the quarter chicken with 2 sides. Everything was tasty and quite delicious.
 We would certainly  return and try something else from the menu."}
{"text":"As a Peruvian, I have to be very carful about this review :-P

First time at the restaurant for lunch and it looked like a McDonald's in Paris (packed!) the concept is unique... it's fast food Peruvian... Everything that they had is quickly put together on the spot. I had the tallarin saltado with beef and it was surprisingly good. Everyone seems to be enjoying their meal. The Peruvian rotisserie chicken is pretty good.  

If you want a quick glimpse of what Peruvian food is with an American production twist, this is the place for you. Prices are a little high for my taste for an everyday lunch place. 

Try the inca kola, it's what all Peruvians grow up with... The national soft drink."}
{"text":"After moving from NYC, I'm always looking for places to eat (bookmarking most of restaurants in Charlotte) and I finally found my go-to place to get rotisserie chicken and sweet plantain. This place is very casual and fast service - either dine in or to go, all the staffs are very friendly. I made my second visit last Sunday and I'm devoted to try every single one of them on the menu!"}
{"text":"I come to Viva Chicken for the Arroz Chaufa. DELICIOUS and very huge portions. You can essentially split between meals! I suggest ordering ahead though because the lines are typically long! :)"}
{"text":"It was enjoyable and I'll absolutely return to try out other menu items. Husband and I shared a chicken platter with green beans and cilantro rice. The rice was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was on point - cilantro is one of my favorites and in my opinion, often under utilized. Greens were great. I was over the moon with the chicken, but certainly appreciate the time and detail invested in their cooking process. The Peruvian seasoning is actually put under the skin before they roast in a charcoal oven. This results in juicy, flavorful pieces and if you're not a fan on skin-on, don't fret... because it peels right off. Viva also makes three specials sauces to accompany their menu, but I don't eat spicy food at all so was unable to sample these. My husband loves it and goes often with his colleagues - he definitely feels the sauce 'makes the chicken a 5.'"}
{"text":"Everything about this place and food is 100!
I get the stuffed avocado and wow! Truly delicious! 
The chicken soup is also top notch. 
But their Herbal Limeade?! Yes! Get it!!! So addicting, so good!
Side note: I waited what seemed to be a long time. But it could've just been that time of day, also this is real food, so it's worth the wait if you do end up waiting a little longer then expected."}
{"text":"Go to Pio Pio - much better choice if you want authentic.  While this place isn't bad it's more of Peruvian fast food.  The rotisserie chicken is much more tender, juicy and flavorful at Pio Pio.  Here it is dry and bland.  The sauces are so so.  Didn't seem authentic.  If you have a choice Pio Pio is much tastier and better value - you get a salad in addition to 2 sides."}
{"text":"Everything is wonderful here. Friendly, fast service. Healthy ingredients with large portions."}
{"text":"MAN OOO MAN, the food here is super flavorful. It was so good I had to return the next day. I've tried several of the menu items now, all of which were great! The prices are fine and the restaurant was clean. The staff was very friendly and answered many of the questions I had while trying Peruvian for the first time. Definitely don't sleep on this spot, it's delicious."}
{"text":"They catered a lunch (chicken, rice and green beans) for our adult class of 55 people after church today, and they did a great job.

The food was plentiful and very flavorful, and they supplied all the place settings, napkins and serving pieces.  

Thank you Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"This place is my new chicken favorite!  It is absolutely the best chicken I have ever eaten. It is fresh. Tender. Flavorful. I love it."}
{"text":"Food continues to be awesome.   Arroz Chaufa is out of this world.  Can't wait for the Northlake store to open."}
{"text":"I had a great experience there at around 4 o'clock, I received great service from the cashier as to what to order as it was my first time, I liked the easy access to all the sauces and the self service feel that provides. I got the 1/4 chicken (white meat) and 2 sides of a fruit cup and french fries! The fries were natural and good and the mixed fruit cup was a pleasant surprise of orange,pineapples,mango, and green apple. I thought the chicken was perfect and plentiful with delicious hormone free meat! Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! Great place for vegan/vegetarians and meat eaters!! My family loves this place considering we all like something different. And they have the most delicious drinks behind the counter - i would give this a 10/5 if I could!!!"}
{"text":"EVERY VIVA CHICKEN IN CHARLOTTE IS AMAZING! I have eaten in at this location twice and picked up food to go once. Same great amazing experience EVERY time. Seriously, these guys know consistency. 

Thank you for providing our area with healthy quick food alternatives. I love Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"I went with a coworker for Lunch today, 5/28 around 1145. This was my first time there as I'm from WI. I had the Naked Peruvian wrap with jalapeño bacon and Solterito as my side. 
The wrap was tasty and stayed together, unlike wraps at other places that fall apart after one bite. 
The Solterito, wasn't something I cared for, but went off of my coworkers recommendation. I'm not a fan of onions and this side dish had plenty of them. Other than that, it had plenty of flavor and was fresh! 
The atmosphere was clean, fresh and friendly! 
Would recommend going here"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Viva Chicken fan, and now that there is one in my backyard I'm ECSTATIC. This is the best place to get good, healthy eats FAST. The salads are perfectly portioned, but don't forget to order chicken. Also, mix the green and yellow sauces at the condiment bar. It's so good! Thank you Viva Chicken for opening this location!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing super great food and super great service! Definitely try the Inca Kola soda it's great!"}
{"text":"The quinoa salad I had was on point. I stopped in to try it out and saw that it was a kind of Americanized, corporate Pollo A la Brasa spot so ok. It get locals accustomed to comida de Peruano, that's Peruvian food for those that don't know.
They're brought Charlotte some flavor...literally."}
{"text":"The lunch I had today at the new Waverly location was terrific.   I chose a Cobb salad that had the freshest ingredients, including golden raisins, avocado, the hugest kernels of corn I have ever seen, and roasted pulled Peruvian chicken.  Although I have dined at other Viva locations, this was my favorite experience so far. The food just tasted so FRESH!   We sat outside on the patio in perfect autumn weather.  Everyone who worked there was super friendly, almost unbelievably so.  Oh, don't forget to get a side of the yuca.   The world needs more yuca!   Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We both got the Tacu bowls, one with chicken and the other with steak. Both were great, but would recommend the chicken as that what they are known for. Someone had recommended the stuffed avocado to us, so we tried it and were not disappointed!  I would suggest not getting avocado on your bowl and instead, ordering a stuffed avocado and putting it in your bowl."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is in Concord, so happy!
Viva chicken will also provide catering for our events.  They do delivery if you place a catering order over $150.00 in sales."}
{"text":"Aside from Colombian food, Pueruvian food is on the top of my list for all time favorite S.A. food. I have had authentic Pueruvian dishes so I am not going to say that its 100% authentic but as far as other restaurants in the area,cheese sauce is what makes this dish) and their Rotissarie Chicken, ALL of which were delicious. The services is relatively fast and very friendly. You can order online and pick up! I love the modern and welcoming spin. Great welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Viva in Ballantyne. The staff friendliness and food is not the same. Viva is not true Peruvian but a twist and more Americanized (let's just be honest) but it's good. My biggest disappointment was the sauce! They now have self serve sauce and they have watered down the recipe. What I loved about Viva has allowed itself to drop in quality. What a shame"}
{"text":"I love Viva Chicken. My favorite location is on Elizabeth. I'm so happy you opened one in Indian Trail. I wasn't impressed with my food today. Clearly the cooks are not reading the boxes when it says no tomatoes or no avocado. Both sandwiches came with both. Also the steak wasn't well done. I'm still hopeful some kinks need to be worked out. It's still the first few days of their grand opening."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything is fresh with wonderful flavor. They have large portions For the sandwiches and wraps , easily can split between two people. You might need to order an extra side of frys through. The regular fries are amazing, sweet potatoes frys are so-so.  The avocado appetizer is a favorite , and they have two in house sauces that I put on everything!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with the fam Saturday night. My brother-in-law had a better idea to satisfy my Mom's and my craving for chicken. This Peruvian chicken hit the spot. The flavor was fantastic and everyone ate quickly. There were three different kinds of sauces you could grab from dispensers near the water/soda fountain and I tried all three although the chicken really didn't need it. 

I had a quarter of chicken and two sides. My sides were the chicken soup and sweet potato fries. Too many onions in the soup for me to handle so I traded and finished someone else's green beans, which were delicious. Everyone had some of the sweet potato fries and quite enjoyed them. As for my drink, I chose to branch out and try something new: the chicha morada. Peruvian Purple Corn, Cinnamon, Clove, Pineapple, Apple, Limes. Tasted like Christmas. That unique flavor alone was fascinating. 

This is a stand in line to pay at the counter and collect your number kind of spot, but someone checked on us often to see if we needed anything, took away plates, and filled up drinks. Impressive service. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent Food. My favorites are the avocado w/ chicken. I also like the tacu bowl and fried rice. My boys like the wrap sandwich."}
{"text":"I have ridden by this place multiple times.  My wife decided to go pick us up something and I had their half chicken.  Chicken was awesome and juicy and their green sauce with my chicken and the rice were spot on.  It will be a main staple in our going out to eat diet since I didn't notice unnecessary ingredients and seemed pretty healthy.  At least I am not going to do research on it and prove myself wrong.  Overall a good place with different menu items than I am used to seeing.  Not a huge place inside but they do have some patio seating."}
{"text":"I had lunch at the Ballantyne Viva la Chix... My first time.. OUTSTANDING!   Highly recommend the quinoa stuffed avocado w/ pulled chicken!  5-Stars!"}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! I ordered half of chicken cilantro rice and French fries. I also had some Ají and mixed it with the food. I also ordered a drink called Chicha Morada and an Inca Cola. It sounds like a lot food and it was but I loved it. To top it all I ate some delicious 3 leches. People come and eat at this place you'll love it."}
{"text":"Amazing food so glad I found this place the flavors are outstanding!!!  The funky music adds a different kind of vibe.  I've been the 3 different locations and they all stay true to theme and taste which I love. Knowing that whatever side of town I'm on I can rely on this place to be yummy and never disappointing"}
{"text":"One of the best Peruvian restaurants I have tried in NC!    Plantains and fried yucas areee sooooo good! It's definitely worth it! Whole chicken and its 3 sides were enough food for 8 people! People are super nice and the place is very clean :)
Can't wait to be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Immediately when you walk in you have someone from the staff talking to you. Actually I'm pretty sure almost every employee that worked there asked me how the food was. Whether you are coming for lunch or dinner, this chicken is always a great healthy option and it was delicious. I hope they open a spot in Charleston."}
{"text":"This is a cool fast food chicken place. I think no one makes chicken as good as the Peruvians do and this place keeps that idea intact. It was juicy, tasty and the yellow sauce was just fabulously delicious. This came with 2 sides.. you can get yuca fries and plantains both of which were excellent. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"TO. DIE. FOR.

And I don't say that lightly.

We ordered this in to cater a work function last week and it was one of the most PHENOMENAL things I have ever tasted. I had the Wow Lomito - FULL of steak, no skimping. I could only get down half of it before I was full enough to burst.

Will definitely be returning. Frequently. If you get a chance to try it out, DO IT! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love viva chicken. It's reviews suggested it would be a slam dunk. Unfortunately it ended up being a mayonaise-y, lackluster execution of some novel food ideas. 

I had the quinoa-stuffed avocados. They were great - the bland mayonnaise sauce they were topped with was gross. 

I tried all three of the sauces. The best is the mild (green). The medium (yellow) was greasy and loaded with mayonnaise, we couldn't stomach more than a bite. The \"gringo-killer\" hot (orange) sauce had a bit of a kick but plenty more mayonnaise limited its appeal.

The chicken was fine. 

The plantains were decent, but tasted like it had been in a steamer tray for a while before being served. 

The restaurant is self service with adult beverages and a nice selection of house made juices. They use compostable dinnerware which is cool."}
{"text":"Great place!  Gets very busy during the lunch hour. The food is always delicious and the menu has plenty of healthy options. I go to is the 1/2 Chicken and green beans and yuca but today I had the quinoa."}
{"text":"If I could have Viva everyday I soooo would.. Everything on this menu is delish... And the service is excellent."}
{"text":"First time at Viva Chicken. This was some of the best chicken I've had. Different kind of spices - not too hot, well balanced. Great flavor, cooked perfectly. Plantains and Cilantro rice was great. Don't miss some of the special sauces (but watch out for the hot one!)

Service was good, staff was friendly and helpful for us first timers."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian with a meat eating family this is a great place to go. Fresh food and cooked/prepared perfectly. the sauces are great. the beverages are delish. My mother goes to the Park road location. I prefer elizabeth! Nonetheless, this is a place you def. need to hit!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good thinks about this place.  The food and service is amazing.   The staff is always so friendly and helpful and the quality is consistent."}
{"text":"it was good, but not THAT good. I've had far better peruvian food in my life than this. Crowded, and you should skip the sangria. not that fantastic."}
{"text":"Finally able to eat at this place this week.  Every time we walked by it was overcrowded but today we went early at 11am.   It was still busy but we sat down inside.   I love Peruvian chicken places and our favorite is Pio Pio, so that is what we base our review from.  I ordered what I normally order at Pio Pio, a 1/2 chicken and a side, they didn't have my tostones,  :(  but they did have yuca and sweet plantains.  We also had the Chaufa with chicken.  The chicken was good, nothing to say I needed to have it again but  decent not what I expected,  thought it would be better after all the reviews raving about it.  The Chaufa was on the sweet side, didn't have the Peruvian taste I expected and besides picking out a few large bones it wasn't bad.  Once again I expected to be blown away by this place but just felt like an ordinary meal, nothing there we had would make me desire to return.   The yuca sticks were good as well as the sweet plantains.   The price also I thought was a little on the high side for what we had, even the area taken into consideration.   $22 for half chicken,  chaufa (fried rice with chicken).  For taste and price Pio Pio is much better in our opinion."}
{"text":"Had to fly down on Super Bowl Sunday for Monday morning meetings that start at 8 AM (who starts meetings at 8 AMs after the Super Bowl???). With a little help from Yelp and friends in the Ballantyne area, ended up going to Viva Chicken just to pick up food.  Now first let me say this, I'm an active weight lifter, so destroying a whole chicken is no problem.  I get them all the time from other latino-infused places....as well as Costco's famous $4.99 whole rotisserie chicken deal.  You may call me a rotisseries connoisseur :) .

So from an ordering perspective, went with half a chicken and two chicken soups.  The chicken was very good.  Perfectly moist, the marinade has the right spices, and of course rotisserie along with the unmistakable taste charcoal cooking provides.  Got all three sauces to try and while I was expecting a lot of flavor, I honestly wasnt blown away by them.  Still good though, but not a sauce that sticks out to me like a good spanish aioli.

Tasted the soup and it is perfect.  This might sound weird, but will be a perfect pre-workout breakfast in the morning to fuel a workout with the rice, veggies, chicken, and broth.

Many of the other sides looked good as well, so future visits will lead to future sampling.

Overall, very good and would recommend it. If I lived down here, I would certainly be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Arrived about 30 minutes before closing on a Thursday evening. The drink machine is out of ice and another dine-in customer and I are sharing the same table delivery number. The place is obviously popular as at least six customers are waiting for take out. The rotisserie chicken breast was delicious,  but small. The plantains we're awesome and the salad premade in a plastic container. Considering I could have had fresh carne asada and unlimited chips and salsa for the same price, I felt a bit slighted. But,  it was convenient to the hospital which was a plus."}
{"text":"The chicken and chicken soup are amazing! My new favorite restaurant in charlotte! Great value and price! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Solid place to sit in for lunch or dinner or perfect for a quick weeknight pickup. Your getting Peruvian style food so it is relatively healthy with a good number of sides to choose from (hit the green beans and sweet potato fries quite a bit). 

Pro tip: if it's your first time try each one of the sauces  (yellow, green, red). You won't know which sauce you want for your chicken and/or side till you've been a few times.

Shout out: goes to the cashier lady who helped me after I blew my pickup order (called the wrong location) - she fixed it and was super cool about the mistake. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is pretty good. They have an interesting menu of offerings which are a little different from my other favorite Peruvian chicken place. High points are the maracuya juice and the maracuya dessert -- I like sour flavors and they are most delicious. The quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken is another winner. Most of the sides are pretty tasty. I would say that everything comes off a little more \"fast-foody\" than other Peruvian chicken I've had in town. It's something about the spice blends -- there's a lot of intensity on the salt and black pepper but some of the more subtle flavors are lost, and items that aren't peppery, like the various potato salads, can be just a bit bland. Which is not to say that I would not eat there again. It's an overall good restaurant experience, the patio is a lovely place to sit, and the sangria is delicious and not too strong to drink at lunch."}
{"text":"When looking for a lunch or dinner option that's out of the box and packed with fresh flavors from South of the border, not to mention easy on the budget and the schedule, Viva has become my new go-to.

The focus is on rotisserie-style chicken made in-house.  The outside is covered in seasoning and cooked to near fall-off-the-bone perfection.  And then you get your choice of sauces, all made on-premises, that are each show-stoppers in their own right.  One creamy with just the hint of a spice kick, one packed with diced cilantro, and another red with the chili pepper base and a smoky flavor with a just a bit of kick at the end.  All 3 very different, but somehow each work perfect with the chicken.

Most meals also come with a choice of sides, which are anything but an afterthought here.  Rice seasoned with cilantro, beans modestly spiced with a cumin and other herbs, and even a small green salad with red onion and a balsamic vineagrette all show the kitchen's skill and focus on flavor.  Even the regular fries and the sweet-potato fries are elevated due to a coating that makes them particularly crunchy upon presentation.  The same can be said for the fried yucca.  A great alternative to the fries, these wedges have a slightly sweet and earth flavor that pairs well with creamy sauce.  I've also found the sweet plantains to be well done here, with just the right consistency, not too mushy and not too firm.  

This is not to say the other menu offerings are second-class citizens, however.  The Lomolito sandwich is quite nice, for example.  Thin strips of seasoned stake and vegetables are served an a super fresh roll that finds the right balance between crunch and chew.  Vegans and vegetarians can rejoice with the other options here, including the uber-healthy avocado stuffed with quinoa.  

I also like the restaurant's decidedly green focus, using compost friendly plates and utensils while also making an effort to separate the trash to increase recyclables.  Even the patio in the back is earth-friendly, with hanging gardens of herbs and flowering plants.  The only ding I can find here is the music.  It's a constant club dance mix that's just a tad too loud, especially at lunch time.  While it is lively, its a little off-putting for a mostly-business lunch crowd.  Still, it's worth the fist-pumping beats to chow down on some of the best fast-fare you can find within earshot of uptown.  The quality is all there and the flavor quality is superb.  Here's to hoping for a very long life for Viva, a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I just discovered Viva Chicken recently and I keep going back.  The food is fresh and delicious.  Love all of the very refreshing herb and fruit  infused drinks.  Always busy, but the wait never seems too long."}
{"text":"The fried rice with chicken is super good, make sure you get some of their amazing yellow sauce to mix into it. I wasn't a big fan of their speciality drinks, but that could just be my preference. We have been in the process of moving and haven't had any pots or pans to cook at home and this has been a great takeout option because it feels healthier/more like a real meal than fast food."}
{"text":"Arroz Chufa is basically the best thing ever. Everything is delicious and a good price but I definitely get arroz chufa (fried rice) with chicken almost every single time. They have different sauces you can try, but my favorite is the yellow one. It's so good with the fried rice. They are usually pretty fast and have plenty of seating-- though we usually get it to go. One order of fried rice feeds two adults easily. I tried a few of their speciality drinks once and didn't really like them, so I would try them before you purchase. This is one of our regular go-tos when I don't want to make dinner."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken does not get enough credit. I loved the different sauce options, the healthy options, and how fresh the food was. Great to grab for lunch or dinner on the way home."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I have eaten in Charlotte in my short time here.  It was FABULOUS!  We were tired of Thanksgiving leftovers so we decided to try something new.  I didn't realize it was only a few blocks from my job.  I loved the Arroz Chaufa with chicken and my sisters and friends shared a whole chicken with green beans and plantains.  The plantains were awesome and extra fresh!  I didn't try the green beans. The best part of Viva Chicken were the sauces!  I loved the Roasted Rococo sauce mixed in the Arroz Chaufa.  I was so impressed with the food that I went back the next day and got the same thing for lunch and ate half of it that day and left the rest for the next day.  Ok...so I may be a little addicted but I'm sure it will die down eventually."}
{"text":"I can not stop eating Viva Chicken. It's the best food in this world. The stir fry rice is my absolute favorite for lunch but their hot sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"The food here is extremely fresh healthy and flavorful. Will definitely come back. The staff was really friendly and the prices are reasonable. I would recommend this as a spot for a good flavorful food and eating healthy"}
{"text":"Usually it's me doling out the advice on where to eat, but this time around my friends, who are Charlotte newcomers, recommended this place to me and boy were they right! Being an Elizabeth resident, I obviously knew this place was here, but I was kind of thinking \"eh, how great could chicken be?\" VERY GREAT, APPARENTLY. 
I got a quarter chicken, white meat, with cilantro rice and plantains. Of course, I had heard all about the yellow sauce and had to try it. I intended to try the other two sauces but I ate so fast I didn't have time. Oh well, guess I'll have to go back! My food was AMAZING, I loved every bit of it. The staff was so friendly, asking me if I needed anything and clearing tables and restocking supplies. I messaged my friends to let them know I had finally tried it, and my message said \"I think I'm just going to keep ordering food and live here forever.\" I have a feeling that living there is against the health code, but they can't stop me from coming back until I try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Love my experience at ViVa! I had such a great lunch Friday that I was still craving it Saturday! The sauces were delicious and you just can't go wrong with the chicken. The bowl is my go to and it's too good to pass up. It's kinda like chipotle you get everything in it since I can't ever decide what to get. The fried rice is also great and highly recommend it. 

It does stay busy so be prepared to wait and be patient! Everyone is hungry just like you. :-)"}
{"text":"I had never been to viva chicken before until a couple days ago and it was awesome! Some people had told me it was just like chipotle but I disagree. I I thought it was way better than chipotle. There menu items were very good looking and I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"It's authentic Peruvian place.Every thing fresh and nice flavory smell.Its good a option for vegetarian people.I tried \"INCA WRAP\" and \"Fried rice with egg\" it's really delicious  lot of beans and vegetables inside bonus with stuffed avocado."}
{"text":"Please if you're looking for a something different don't deny yourself of the freshness and unique taste and there twist on chicken.  I especially like the sauces from which to choose. All i'll say is the sauces will make your mouth water."}
{"text":"Viva is 1 of my favorite restaurants in town. So I just had to try this location and it didn't disappoint. They were very well staffed the food was fresh and they we're very organized to handle the crowd of a Saturday afternoon. Keep it going guys!"}
{"text":"Eat here often. Never fails. Quick service. Stand in line. Order. Take a number. Grab a table, get your drink, napkins, and silverware. DON'T forget the sauce! I prefer the green, it's in between. Not too spicy. Love that green drink too. They clean up your table when you leave. I get the 1/2 white meat chicken, cilantro rice, green beans or salad. The fried rice is good as is a winner by my husband, my kids like the steak sandwich. I also really live the stuffed avocado. Can't wait til they open their Waverly location off Providence at 485."}
{"text":"There used to be no greater fan of viva chicken than me. When they first opened, I was there once a week or more.  I often let them know how well I thought of them. I would take friends and fam there.  I even once declared, \"I want to marry Viva Chicken\" on Yelp.  But no more. The honeymoon is definitely over. LOL!  The staff has gotten rude.  The management is argumentative, does not value loyalty, and does not appreciate its long time customers. The pricing - which has always been on the high side - for ubiquitous things like rice, beans, and chicken - has increased. The reward point value was slashed. The set up is even more awkward than it was before now that customers have to wait in line to pump their own condiments. And the kicker is that the chicken can get dry and stringy if you don't time your purchase right and you will definitely need the toothpicks they now make available. How disappointing.  Qué lástima. :-("}
{"text":"Based on all of the reviews I was expecting something extremely special.  I had 1/2 chicken with the beans and fries. It was slightly better than average.  The hot sauce was pretty good.   

Service was quick and everyone was very nice."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken oh how you've stole my heart!  Yes, it's fast food.  No, you'd never think that as you're devouring this delicious rotisserie chicken!  As fresh as you could ever expect or want, and with a distinct flavor of the Peruvian style!  Don't miss out on the rotisserie chicken with its slightly charred exterior, and the plantains, canary beans, fries, sweet potatoe fries, and solterito are all fantastic!!
Viva Chicken is similar to the Chipotle model, and somewhere I'd go to more often if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The chicken is delicious. Cooked perfectly. Not the dry rotisserie chicken you get at the supermarket that sticks to your teeth! The service is awesome also. Chloe refilled my drink and took away the plates. Will definitely return! Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"I love Viva Chicken! It's one of my favorite places to eat :-) I usually get the Tacu bowl, but this time I tried the new pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. It was amazing! The ciabatta bread was very fresh and the pork was tender and juicy. The daikon radish gave it a great texture and it had a generous amount of cilantro, which I love! The sweet potato fries were perfect too. Usually sweet potato fries are soggy but these were perfectly crisp. I will definitely order that again."}
{"text":"So let me give you the insight on Viva Chicken.. Although it is obvious that they specialize in chicken, as it is in the name, it is also a great place for vegetarians to indulge in!!

In my pre-pescatarian days I would always get the half chicken that was cooked to perfection!! Now that I have eliminated land meat from my diet, I have ventured to other items on the menu that is just as good! The Naked Peruvian is a wrap that I enjoy grabbing for is I want something quick for lunch. I get it without the cheese easy on their special mayo and some of the green sauce to drip it into. It's filling, and simply delicious!

Now onto my FAV non-meat item on the menu.. The Arroz Chaufa w/ a side of green beans that I mix into the rice and top with the spicy red sauce!! OMG it is soooo good!!! I order this at least once of week for takeout. You can request it without the egg for a super tasty vegan dish. The portion is plenty and the container they serve it in when you order to go is super handy to hold onto and keep. Wash everything down with their herbal lemonade and you will not be disappointed!!

I simply love everything about Viva Chicken, from their quality food and friendly customer service. If you are living in Charlotte and have not eaten here.. Your Missing Out!!"}
{"text":"I brought my parents to Viva Chicken in Elizabeth on a Saturday for lunch. We ordered a whole chicken to share, which comes with three sides. We selected the cilantro rice, canary beans, and plantains. After seating ourselves, we treated ourselves to the sauce bar, and waited only a few moments for our meal to be delivered. 

Our chicken was presented to the table in a paper-lined basket, and our sides in family-sized bowls. The rice was perfect and was the first thing to disappear from each of our plates. Very tasty. The canary beans were flavorful and had a slight heat to them. The plantains were excellent, but I wish there were twice as many! Note to self: grab a double-order of plantains next time. 

The chicken was unreal. Served at the perfect temperature, it fell apart with hardly any effort when digging in with a fork. The seasoning was generous and mouthwatering. My father is watching his diet and as I watched him remove the skin from his portion of the chicken, I quickly snatched it up to enjoy for myself. So good. 

I chose Chicha Morada for my drink, and it was delightful. The menu lists it as a drink made from Peruvian Purple Corn, Cinnamon, Clove, Pineapple, Apple, and Lime. It's a beautiful rich purple color. The drink teetered on the edge of being too sweet, but the spicy and fruity flavor perfectly complimented the savory chicken and sides. I'd order this again in a heartbeat. The cinnamon and clove make me feel as though it would be especially enjoyable in the wintertime.

While it was very busy during our visit, we received exceptional service. Everyone we encountered was kind, helpful, and engaged with their work. 

My only complaint -- and I understand it's not specific to this location -- is the disposable plates and utensils. Granted, they're not cheap, flimsy pieces, but it would take a wonderful meal to the next level to enjoy it on a real plate with actual silverware. 

After winning my folks over with such a great experience, I know we'll be back. Extra plantains for me."}
{"text":"Wow! What a yummy quinoa salad I got there! I was amazed by the favors this salad had and it was very filling! Very clean and sweet staff. The tres leches cake was okay. Not as moist as it should be."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 10 stars, but 5 was the max. 

Since discovering Viva about 2 months ago, I eat here at least 1 a week and the experience has been consistently awesome. Great Food, Fast and friendly service, hassle free parking....What else can you ask for? To top off, there is a gentleman that goes around checking on all the customers and make sure that the place stays clean. You can tell that they have a passion for good food and service.

The rotisserie chicken is a delicious classic. Try it with the yellow sauce.

The Chaufa with steak is absolutely amazing.. Don't forget your sauce lol."}
{"text":"I saw great reviews. The chicken is tasty. I got that and 2 sides. The portions were small. Perhaps okay as lunch portions but definitely too small as dinner. The cilantro infused rice was dry. The plantains were good but I wish there was a little more food. The service is great, and the managers come and check everything is okay."}
{"text":"Yum! Fast and delicious Peruvian food.  I had the Tacu Bowl with chicken. Delish!  My husband has the 1/2 rotisserie chicken with plantains and rice. We also got a basket of fries which were very good. Nice and crisp. Good portions. I couldn't  eat all of my bowl... so I'll enjoy leftovers later. Saw a lot of people getting takeout as well. Service was good as well. 4/5, I enjoyed it, would go again, but it wasn't mind blowing."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place............
GO. GET. NOW. NOWWWWWW.

I went for the first time today and I am SO glad I did. I went with a friend and we ordered one whole chicken that came with three sides (yes, call us fatties). Honestly, we had no idea how much food we were about to be given.....But for the price? OH YAS PLS. Luckily, we went RIGHT before it started getting super crowded so we copped some seats. Our order came out within 5 minutes and we were extremely surprised at the amount of food that was set on our table: 1 whole chicken, courteously cut up for us, 1 full basket of sweet potato fries, 3 cups of fresh fruit, 1 huge mound of cilantro rice, and 4 different delectable sauces that I have imprinted on my tastebuds for the rest of my life.

The chicken was absolutely perfect--seasoned to perfection, cooked to perfection, and the cilantro rice complimented it SO well. The rice was so delicious it still makes me sigh thinking about it. It wasn't seasoned in the salt-and-pepper way, per say, but it was infused with cilantro that was seriously packed with flavor. It's not like the cilantro rice from Chipotle where they just sprinkle a few cilantro flakes on the rice--this is LEGIT cilantro rice. The sweet potato fries were FRESH and so good as well. The fresh fruit (consisted of chopped green apples, pineapples, and oranges) actually blew my mind as well: 1. They were ACTUALLY fresh, 2. this combo may seem like nothing special but oh gosh, you have to try it, and 3. it is the perfect fresh, citrusy/acidic combo that refreshes your mouth in between bites of the chicken and rice. The thing that impressed me the most here though was their sauces... I don't know what kind of crack they  put in that stuff but it is the BEST I EVER HAD. I can't.. like....wut?? Wut even?????? I can't even describe what the taste is like because it's just GOOD. like REAL GOOD. Like, you have to try once in your lifetime good. It goes soo well with the rice, fries, and chicken.. If they sold just the sauces separately I would totally stock up.

Next time, I have a bunch of other things I want to try, including their sangria. I definitely feel like I will become a regular here. Plus they are environmentally conscious!"}
{"text":"My coworker introduced me to this awesome place. I am so in love with this place. The food here is so delicious. It is not just the place for the meat eater and it is also a great place to eat for the vegetarians. My coworker got the Arroz Chaufa which it is fried rice and the portion is huge. I got the Inca wrap the vegetarian style, you can also add chicken or steak to your wrap. It comes with a side item.  I got the fried yucca so darn good. Next time I will try the plantains. If you go during lunch time, the seating can be limited. They have three sauces you can try. I love the yellow and the green sauces. Also, you got to try their juices. My coworker recommended me the passion fruit juice."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I would say\" if you haven't had Viva Chicken and you live in Charlotte....ya not Living\"!!! Food here is amazing!  I'm hooked- thank God I live around the corner"}
{"text":"We visited Viva again for to-go, and of course I got the delicious herbal lemonade again. I love that they don't put ice in it. This time I tried the arroz chauffa with chicken.  It was pretty dern delicious.  The most impressive thing is the amount of food they give you with this dish.  I ate dinner and two lunches off of it.  A hungry man could probably eat it for two meals.  For my little tummy though it's the perfect dish to stretch over the week. I also love their green (spicy) and yellow (kinda sweet/savory/mild) sauces they make.  Such a unique flavor."}
{"text":"Sorry to say the food is starting to suffer. Viva has always been my go to take out place.  But the last two times the chicken has been dry and over cooked. Plus they didn't include the sauces even though I ordered them. The sauce would at least have helped with the dryness. The quinoa is ok but way over salted.  I will be looking for another Peruvian chicken takeout."}
{"text":"I really love the food at Viva Chicken and have dined there quite a few times. Love the sauces! 
I have never has an order problem when I've dined in. However there seems to be a takeout order fulfillment problem at this store. The two times I've taken out the order has been wrong (I've only taken out two times.) First time I ordered a whole chicken (all dark which they'll do which is cool.) I came home and there was only a half chicken. When I called to complain they offered to change it if I came back. I didn't want to go out again so they ended up comping my food. Correct response. 
Tonight I called in my order for a whole dark chicken and went to pick it up. Thankfully I checked my order before I left. This time they had given me an all white chicken.
Anyway, moral of this story is you need to check your takeout before you leave (which we shouldn't have to do.)"}
{"text":"I tried Viva Chicken due to Yelp review, so I'm passing it on. This has quickly become my go-to spot to meet friends for lunch, take out-of-town guests and just grab a delicious meal.

My husband and I like to share the whole chicken with sides when we go and have leftovers to take home.  Our favorite sides are:  fries (my favorite, there's something addicting and SO good about them) and plantains (my husband loves them so much he won't try any other sides!).  My niece ordered the kids chicken fingers today and she loved those too (ask for a kids menu, it's not on the main menu).  

What is remarkable about Viva Chicken is that no matter what time of day I go in (2pm late lunch today), the food is always fresh, hot and delicious.  The service, which I don't normally expect at a \"Fast service\" restaurant is superb.  Such wonderful and friendly people!  It makes me happy to go there.  

The flavors in the chicken are outstanding.  It's a MUST TRY place!"}
{"text":"Best Peruvian chicken I have ever tasted. Very moist and the seasonings are amazing. I'm not a huge fan of the yucca fries but I don't like them anywhere. 

Also - their tres leches is a must."}
{"text":"Yelp never lets me down. What a fantastic place. The rotisserie chicken is incredible. I just finished eating here for lunch. I ordered the 1/2 chicken with plantains and fries. Wife ordered the classic with steak. So much peruvian flavor, affordable and service was terrific. If you are in the city you got to hit this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite takeout spots in Charlotte.  The chicken is always moist, the sauces are good, and the rice with vegetables is light and refreshing."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. It is the kind of restaurant that I like to go to when I am exhausted, overworked, and just need a pick-me-up that will be delicious and satiating. I have ordered numerous things on their menu from their salads to quinoa stuffed avocado, to even their half-chicken with sides...and all are on point (I've never had a bad meal from this place).
The amarillo sauce is my favorite, and I think if my palate could tolerate spicier sauces, I would probably enjoy the other sauces too. Nevertheless, this place is amazing and would recommend this restaurant for any occasion (e.g. visitors passing through charlotte, a quick meal after work, a date, etc.)."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed  with viva chicken. Food was ok but service and attention to detail was not very good. I had to ask someone to find my food for me and it was cold...i think they just over looked my order. They were not very busy. I hope this is not a trend. I had been there several times before and it has always been fast and hot food and a manager always ask how the food and service was, not tonight. Something was just different  to night."}
{"text":"Food: I have been here to eat a few times and each time I have not been disappointed! I always go for their rotisserie chicken. Whatever they season it with is delicious and the chicken always comes out juicy, never dry. For their sides I went with the sweet plantains and cilantro infused rice. I wanted to branch out and try plantains although I must say they weren't my favorite. The rice, however, was yummy!

Service: Customer service there was equally as enjoyable. I liked how the owner came out to check on our meals and ask us how everything was. 

Atmosphere: Mid-century modern style with an emphasis on recycling which was a plus. Their outdoor seating is very lovely as well.

I will definitely be coming back to this place to try out more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Food was good as usual. However service was seriously subpar

Came with out of town friends to show them the food her. After a 10-15 minute wait in line, got to the cashier and told 40 minutes for rotisserie chicken because they were out.

Forced to order other dishes and pay extra for a meager amount of chicken. I felt like if they've managed to run out of chicken at 6pm the least they can do is offer complimentary chicken for their other dishes instead of forcing customers to pay extra for so little extra meat, or reduced price sides since the main thing we always get are the family chicken plus sides to share. 

Instead the only thing out friends got to try was some fried rice and saltado. Great dishes,  but not really the same experience as trying a larger variety of dishes and sides. 

Also they were yuca which was unfortunate, but the crop being bad is out of their control and glad they're willing to not skimp on food quality. Props on that decision."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! Right outside of uptown Viva Chicken has been one of my favorite finds since moving to Charlotte. The atmosphere is fun and great for any group of people.

The food is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. Their chicken is moist, flavorful and always tastes delicious. The fried yucca is great and pairs well with the dipping cause. I swear the dipping causes have crack in them because I can't stop eating them. I have also tried the sweet plantains, despite not being a huge fan of plantains I thought they were tasty. I have never been let down!

The staff is always great and service is always fast. I will keep coming back that is for sure!"}
{"text":"I came here Aug. 16 for dinner and the employees there meased up our orders. They could not even be efficient with our orders. When one of their employee came to our table to give us out food, she gave me my order and took it back. The employee there refused to give me my food order when I clearly KNOW what I ordered. I was astonished that she even argued with me that the order that she was holding in her hands wasn't mines. She kept arguing with me that it wasn't my order when I know for sure what I odered. She then started getting rude and giving me an attitude. First of all, they messed up. She should apologize that's the first thing you do to your customers. She did not even apologize and just went straight to arguing. I understand there could be miscommunication in the kitchen with the servers, but if you're rude to your customers on top of messing their orders that's not a good combination."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The chicken is so good.  I have had the soup, chicken and salads and they are all great.  I can't wait to try the stuffed avocados.  This is a good option for \"fast food\" that is also very healthy."}
{"text":"OBSESSED is an understatement.  I go to Viva Chicken AT LEAST once a week.  My favorites are the Wow Lomito steak sandwich with extra mild sauce, the Viva Chicken salad (with mild sauce instead of balsamic), and the quinoa stuffed avocado with, you guessed it, more mild sauce.  You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches, which are served on soft chewy ciabatta bread.  Don't forget the mild sauce :)"}
{"text":"I really like this place and have eaten here multiple times but what happened today is just not done. Found a shredded piece of black plastic in my Arroz Chaufa that I had ordered to-go. Hygiene should be foremost when it comes to food guys. This is not done."}
{"text":"You can't beat the value for your money! The atmosphere is nice, clean, and casual. The food is wonderful. There's not a lot of variety but, that's not why you come to Viva chicken.
   The service is pleasant and attentive from the person who greets you to the one who takes your order to the table. It was a great experience from start to finish!"}
{"text":"Great new location for Viva! Staff was super nice and food was great, as always. Portion sizes are huge. I love the arroz chaufa with chicken. There is a nice seating area outdoor too."}
{"text":"It was good, but not great. Staff was friendly for our first time we had ever been and answered questions we had. I wish they offered samples of some if the sides as we had no idea what it tasted like. We got the half chicken: the breast was dry and I did not care for sauses (my own personal reasons, others at the table enjoyed them...I am not a horseradish fan). We also had the green beans and they seemed over cooked and slightly mushy. The can beans tasted like they sound. Over all service was good, but food did not hit it out of the park. We gave it a try tough."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, especially this location. Every time I've come here the place is packed because of their great service and quality of food. I like getting the super salad or the 1/4 chicken w two sides both are so yummy. I tried their soup the other day and was super satisfied with it, my new fave. All food is priced well and if you decide to dine in it's almost like you're at a sit down restaurant because the employees will come and offer refills on drinks, to go boxes, or extra sauce (yellow and green sauce are bomb) so nice! I always have layovers in uptown and this is my go to spot. A must if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Got it to go so I can't speak to the actual restaurant inside or service but the food is some of the best I've had. Think chipolte meets Peru. Great portion for your less than $10 price and the sauces are amazing. The food is absolutely yummy without the three sauces but I couldn't get enough of the sauces. I wish I lived in Charlotte and could get this more often."}
{"text":"It was the pictures of the Chicken Fried Rice that drew me to Viva Chicken today. Sure, they call it something else and it's definitely an interesting idea, combining Peruvian Pollo A La Brasa with the classic Chinese fried rice. They do a great job of it here. Very large portion, very tasty, lots of chicken. Very reasonable price of $10 for the massive platter of yumminess.

They have a soda fountain, urns of sweet and unsweet tea, plus pumps for their three different sauces that range from mild to hot to atomic. I stuck with the mild today. Delish.

My order was ready super quick and brought to my table still very hot on a neat paper plate that went into the bin when I was done. Neat, clean, tidy."}
{"text":"I went for the first time last week during lunch rush and I was in and out in 10 minutes! I ordered a Tacu bowl and added chicken and it was a great decision! It was a pretty large portion easily shareable and all the vegetables are fresh!! I tried all 3 sauces but I would suggest trying all 3 before you decide. The prices are great especially for the amount of food you get!!! Great customer service also!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The chicken was so tasty and delicious. I got it with a side of sweet potato fries and rice. The fries were perfectly crisp. Rice was yummy. I even ate the leftovers a few hours later and they were so good. 

Service was quick and helpful. They were packed during lunch hour during the week so would suggest to go for dinner if you want a quick grab. 

I got their lemonade which was okay, not up to my taste buds but that's just me. 

I'm definitely making lots of trips back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have great tea there and the staff is really friendly.
The restaurant is always nice and clean and it has a Peruvian sort of feel. I visited a McDonald's in Peru while traveling abroad and it was just like a regular American McDonald's. This place is kind of like that but Peruvian and just like an American place, so it's really good.
I still haven't tried any chicken, but it has to be good, right?
Try the tea."}
{"text":"I really wish I had the chance to dine in but this was the first place I saw because I was visiting someone in the hospital. Therefore, I only wanted something small and light because I had to get on the road.
I viewed Yelp pictures of course while inside and I saw the herb juice that they offer. There was a green and a peach colored one. The cashier was nice enough for me to sample both and she suggested they are good mixed. She was right!
For my snack to get on the road, they have caramel churros and they are delicious! Very long and I ordered two so plenty for a snack to get on the road. Next time I visit I want to dine in and eat an entree."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Ordered online and picked up. When we got back to our hotel, they forgot to include the sauces. I would usually check but when I picked up, she even listed the sauces we ordered. Food was so dry, $30 ended going to waste. Maybe next time Viva. Edited this review from 1 star. 1 star is not fair and we ate here at our last charlotte trip and it was good."}
{"text":"Ordered the viva chicken salad for lunch. The chicken was delicious and everything was fresh. We got our meal very fast and the staff is super friendly and customer service driven! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time here today. This place seemed like a pretty healthy place to grab a quick lunch. I ordered the quinoa stuffed avocado and added chicken. It was very good. I came in today around 1 o'clock. It was still pretty crowded but the line was short. The only thing is this place doesn't have many places to sit. In addition, all of the tables were really close together therefore if you were having lunch with someone you knew you were also having lunch with someone you didn't know. I didn't like that. The food was good, it was quick and friendly. I would return but maybe during a less busy time or definitely only to go."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to pass this spot on our way to Savannah with hungry bellies. Everything is good. I love their drink basil lemon cilantro. I wish to come back but it's almost impossible since we live in NY. But definitely MUST go for!"}
{"text":"I am not big on salad but the balsamic salad dressing here makes me LOVE salad. The chicken is always fresh and yuca is amazing!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I get the quinoa avocado!! Great option for vegan eaters and it's really refreshing. I love how quick but efficient they are and very friendly. The place is always clean and a cool hangout spot."}
{"text":"1st time trying Peruvian food! AMAZEBALLS!! It was between 1/4 roasted chicken (my sides were cilantro rice n fried plantains) or shredded chicken quinoa in an avocado bowl. I couldn't decide so I had both. So yummy. Plenty of left overs to bring home...my 2nd dinner. Lol

They have very friendly staff...cute and bubbly. 

Highly recommend! U won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food (and sauces!). The only thing I would change is the music...something a bit more mellow perhaps?"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! It's pretty much our go-to for delicious and easy (and also healthy!) take-out whenever we don't know what to eat! Granted, I order the same thing every time lol, but it's so good! The roasted chicken is to die for, and so are the yuca fries..... And don't forget to order the avocado appetizer with the shredded chicken on top. YUM!"}
{"text":"We eat here constantly. It's healthy and delicious for our whole family. We love the Peruvian vibe. My favorite are the chickens with dipping sauces and then the fries are great if they're hot, don't try them to go. Also the cookies they make are just too much goodness. They are sandwiched in between caramel! Yum."}
{"text":"Amazing. Even if you don't like chicken, you need to come here. Great vegetarian options! Get the avocado apps!"}
{"text":"The rotisserie chicken at this hipster restaurant in Charlotte is bomb, you can also try a couple of things since its pretty cheap. Not only is it moist, it's also savory and the prices can't get any better. We tried one of the special drinks (can't remember what it was called but it was purple) and it was really tasty. The quinoa is delicious too, small side but if you can't decide get this healthy option. Don't leave without trying the Wow Lomito sandwich, the sirloin is so flavorful. 

The only negative is the area it's in. It seems like it's a white neighborhood, so when me and my boyfriend stepped out of the car we got weird and passive aggressive looks from three white men and dozens of people in another restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"Well just took the plunge! We were not disappointed. First I have never had Peruvian food before. My wife and I didn't know what to order. The staff was helpful. Lots of options for both meat eaters and vegetarians. The food was flavorful. I like putting sauces on everything, but didn't want to because it didn't need it. My wife loved her wrap. We can't wait to go back and try something different."}
{"text":"Viva is my new go-to roasted chicken place.  I have ordered their chicken there and also gotten it to go.  Not only is the chicken moist and flavorful, they have some great sauces to go with it.  I've had both their mild and medium, and they were both pretty fabulous (that medium packs quite a heat!).  All in all, it is rather reasonably priced.  If you dine in, you can get a quarter quicken and two sides for around $8.  Last time I got a whole chicken and three sides for $18.95.   My partner and I had plenty of leftovers the next day.

As far as the sides go, I've had their beans, yucca, and plantains.  My partner really enjoyed the beans and I thought they had a good flavor.  They have just a touch of sweetness to them.  Their yucca is seriously the best I've ever had.  They texture is much lighter than other ones I've had, so it did not taste too starchy.  Finally, their plantains have a great level of sweetness to them.

If you dine in, you can also order their sangria.  It was quite different than others I've had, but still very good.  I could swear I tasted a little tequila in it.  

Oh crap...now I'm hungry for their chicken!  Viva \"Viva Chicken\"!"}
{"text":"I was told by several friends that the food here was delicious, but I keep putting off stopping in. Finally one Sunday night I didn't feel like cooking so I went in and order a family meal 1 whole chicken and 3 sides, rice, fries, and green beans for $28. Oh my goodness, it was so good for a good price. It was yummy and fresh, everything that I was told. I can't wait to go back to try some of the other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Another upscale type fast food place. Large portions but they come in a resealable plastic container for making plates easy to go. Delicious food."}
{"text":"So - We're RIDICULOUSLY jaded after a few years in San Francisco.  This food and concept could CARVE (maybe violently) a niche in any number of districts in the Bay Area.  Why they haven't yet is beyond me.  Don't walk - RUN here.  The food is lovingly prepared, the service is perfect, the flavors are sublime.  AND - walk-up prices for better than table-service quality food at 95% of the restaurants in Charlotte - you can't go wrong.  GO GO GO!...."}
{"text":"Sweet Mercy, if I'd known places like this existed I would have been a better man...

I'm going to forego too much of a description and rather give a PRESCRIPTION for eating at Viva chicken.  (Briefly, decor is Chipotle-eque and price is somewhere between cheap and moderate).

Here's what you need to do:

1.  Don't eat lunch.  You need to prepare your body for the experience.  A light breakfast is appropriate but you must cleanse yourself before the transformational experience that is Viva Chicken.

2.  Order the Arroz Chaufa with pulled chicken.  Order a side of fries.  Order a soda.  Close your mouth and step away from the counter, lest you alter from this path to glory.

3.  While waiting for your order collect some of each of their sauces, your fries will serve as little more than a delivery method for these delicious spicy ambrosias.

4.  Upon the arrival of your food turn off your cell phone, breathe deep and consume the deliciousness until sleep or exhaustion overtakes you.

Good luck traveler.  The journey you embark on shall change you to your very soul..."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian inspired food! Friendly service and amazing good.  Nice place to catch up with friends!"}
{"text":"Best healthy fast food around!!  Everything is delicious and everyone that works there are nice.  Love coming here for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm really giving 5 stars because of Natalie. She always has excellent customer service and goes out of her way for us."}
{"text":"Good food all the time. The Tacu bowl & fried rice are my favorite. I could eat this everyday. And don't forget the sauce!!! Order on line, it's much faster, they are always busy, which says a lot"}
{"text":"I had a delivery from Door Dash today. After the first 2 bites of eating my chicken tomato wrap from Viva Chicken, I abruptly called the local Ballantyne location and asked to speak to a manager. What was my issue? I explained to Jefferson (the manager) that my food was recently delivered *AND* this was my 1st time EVER eating at Viva Chicken. A little hesitant and cautious, Jefferson was listening for me to drop a bomb. I explained to him that I knew that anytime a customer calls and ask to speak directly to a manager, 99% of the time, it's something negative. This was one of the BEST chicken wraps that I've ever eaten. And it's healthy. (quick note: I am a very picky eater, especially with chicken). Thank you Jefferson and the entire Ballantyne Viva Chicken location. #customerforlife. I hope this puts a smile on someone's face. I choose JOY. Just be nice. It doesn't cost a thing."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best concepts out there! Big future for this franchise! Everything is well prepared and delicious.. Try the quinoa stuffed avocado or the fried rice with rotisserie chicken, don't forget the yellow sauce!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place a few times. Overall the experience is usually 'good' but this time was terrible. Chicken was small and looked like it fell off a truck (broken leg and such). The mild sauce was watery and the cilantro rice was served 'luke-warm'. The cashier was rude and impatient. And the dinner did not agree with my stomach......
Perhaps the place is under NEW management...although I noticed some familiar faces. But as I was leaving I looked at the sanitation score: 90
I will not return to this place....if you like Peruvian cuisine, then I would suggest going to Pio Pio, Genaros, or Viva Chicken in Ballantyne area.

{"text":"I have absolutely no complaints, not even about the parking. I've never tasted such a wonderful combination of flavors in my life. We came to Charlotte for three days, and found this place the first afternoon we were there. Needless to say, we got it for our drive back to NYC as well. If you haven't gone here, go. You're truly missing out. 

Btw, service was excellent each time, and very fast."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast, but I need more yucca!
My wife and I ordered a whole chicken and 3 sides. The chicken came with all three sauces so we were able to sample the flavors, all of which were good. The sides, however, were not quite on par with the chicken. The sweet potato fries were pretty standard, the beans were plentiful but bland, and the yucca fries were perfectly cooked, but we got so few. Oddly, the sweet potato fries came in a big basket, the beans came in a large plastic dish, but the yucca only came in a small cup. I would guess we had about 6 to split between the two of us. For comparison, they were so generous with the beans that we took half of them home with us. I would definitely go again, but I hope they start giving bigger portions for the yucca fries."}
{"text":"I would have thought this place was a chain, but it is not! The decor is very modern and \"green\". My boss took me here and I was very impressed, you can watch them make the food, and it is very clean in the kitchen from the looks of it. We ordered a full chicken with 3 sides of fries, sweet potato fries, and plantains. They were delicious. 
This place is rather casual with an energetic vibe, so I personally would not take anyone here on a date, but very trendy place, I can't wait to see the lengths of where they expand to!"}
{"text":"I moved here from California about 8 months ago, and I can easily say this is the restaurant my husband and I have visited the most! I wish they would branch out to CA, if you ever do-DM me! I'll be your manager. Lol! But really- their sauces are to die for. I like the yellow one (mild) and my hubby does the reddish one (hot.) half chicken and two sides is enough for us to split, but their cilantro infused rice is soooo good we get an extra order of it on the side. Trust me, give this place a try."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise. This isn't just another chicken and rice establishment. The food was very fresh. The chicken was well seasoned and really could be eaten without the famous sauces. But the sauce....The roasted yellow pepper sauce (forget the name) is probably the best sauce I've eaten with chicken...or anything else for that matter!   The rice was nice and fragrant and refreshing, if that makes sense. It wasn't sticky or heavy at all. This place stays very busy. I'd suggest attempting to save a table before you order if possible. The only negative is that this location seems to have more tables than space. So it can get quite crowded. But otherwise, a great place for healthy and tasty food! Can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"Love the food! Avocado and quinoa appetizer is a full delicious meal. Add chicken, and it is one of my favorite meals in Charlotte.... especially if you are sav"}
{"text":"YASSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 4 of us from work ordered Viva Chicken at lunch today and I have never had this place. I am a pretty picky eater but this place is awesome!!! I got the 1/4 chicken, white meat, with sweet potato fries, rice, and tres leches cake. The tres leches cake is real tres leches, absolutely fan freaking-tastic. I would have gotten a picture of my food but i ate it so fast. The rice has perfect flavor, not too much salt, carrots, peas, amazing. We even paid $20 for delivery and I would do it again in a heartbeat. Thank you Viva Chicken, Thank you!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  A perfect mix of healthy options but not sacrificing flavor.  I had the  Tallarin Saltado with chicken and it was awesome.  Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Have been a regular to Viva Chicken but this was my first time at their new Waverly location.  Since it was a new location, the wife and I decided to break away from our regular stuffed avocado and saltado order.  

I got the tacu bowl with chicken, and it was outstanding.  Really important to order this with the cilantro infused rice as it adds a nice layer.  The pickled onions on top were a perfect sour note to counter the 'red sauce' that I could eat with anything...I was a happy camper.  

The wife ordered the 1/4 chicken, but the star of the show was the solterito side. It had two kinds of beans, feta cheese, pickled onions and fresh tomatoes... Super fresh.  

For the first time, we got the Tres Leches, and while it cream soaked sponge cake with a marshmallow frosting (sooo good) it was actually light.  The denseness that usually comes with a dessert was not there.  

As for the location, I am so happy I don't have to drive to Johnston Rd now.  There is plenty of parking, and after dinner, we were able to walk around Waverly and grabbed a drink next door."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place! I use to only get the chicken but recently have been venturing to other items on the menu which have all been delicious. The soup is amazing and they have a delicious vegetarian option the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado!"}
{"text":"What can I say? 

Delicious chicken
Awesome sides
Good service 
Great other options!

There's a reason they're always packed."}
{"text":"Amazing wraps and salads! Always really fresh and quick and an overall great place to grab lunch!"}
{"text":"Other than the music being a little too loud, my family and I enjoy Viva Chicken for a fresh quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Y'all, the hype about this place is real - Viva Chicken is seriously bomb.com and I'm so happy I got to experience it for lunch with my coworkers.

First and foremost, it's a bit of a drive for us to make it to the Concord location, so we didn't have a ton of time to dawdle on the lunch hour. This said, we were all through the order line and barely in our seats when our food arrived - speedy fast!

I got the tacu bowl and added chicken and it was SUPERB. The dish is so flavorful, felt healthy and light, and was extremely filling. Bonus: I have enough left over for lunch tomorrow. My mouth is already watering! (...but seriously)

I love the different sauces and that you can pick and choose (and refill!) as many as you'd like. I was also pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the restaurant. The space was pretty packed as we came right around noon, and usually sauce stations at restaurants get a little sloppy and sticky with the heavy use - which was not the case here. Extra props for that.

Can't wait to come back with the hubby!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Charlotte. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and everything is reasonably priced to boot!

If it's your first time here, the pollo a la brasas are highly recommended as this is a \"Peruvian chicken place\" after all. The rotisserie chickens are incredibly juicy and come in a variety of different portion sizes ranging from 1/4 chicken with 2 sides to a whole chicken with 3 sides (\"family style\"). Yet somehow, no matter what portion size you order it always ends up being too much to finish in one sitting!

In addition to the rotisserie options, Viva Chicken draws heavily from \"chifa\" (Peruvian-Chinese) cuisine as well in the Classic Saltado and Arroz Chaufa options. Both are delicious, but I wanted to highlight the Arroz Chaufa in particular as it puts the fried rice in all the Asian restaurants in Charlotte to shame (and I've been to a lot of the Asian restaurants here). When I'm craving fried rice, I come to Viva Chicken for the Arroz Chaufa.

Last but not least, no visit to Viva Chicken is complete without the churros!! Though some conscious eaters may find these a bit too indulgent, these caramel-filled, cinnamon coated treats are definitely worth the guilt!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently good.  The food is fantastic and the customer service is great.  My only complaint is the jam up at the drink machine.  I try to branch out and try different things each visit and I've never been disappointing.  You cant go wrong with the arroz chaufa and i like a side of plantains as dessert."}
{"text":"The food was fairly disappointing. The service and staff are great.
I got the chicken and rice. The rice was quite bland and the chicken was not very tasty"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Viva Chicken what seems like a million times and always loved it. (See my previous review.) But, recently catered a large event with the Elizabeth location and felt the need to update my review... Their catering service is top notch! I was able to review the menu, make special requests and place my order all over email. Big shout out to Emily O. for taking such good care of us! Emily answered emails within minutes of my sending them and made the entire catering experience from order to delivery totally painless. 

If I have my way, I will use Viva Chicken exclusively for all my catering needs from here on out!"}
{"text":"Have all Viva Chicken locations changed their yucca or just this one? I must go investigate! If only Elizabeth wasn't ripped apart due to construction for a trolley. Anywho, I don't love this new yucca... It was more like a potato wedge than the Viva Chicken yucca of the past that I've come to know and love. Change is hard, y'all. 

Besides yucca-gate, all is well at the Park Road Viva Chicken. The place was packed at dinner time on Monday night but they got everyone through the line and food out to our table quickly. I could still drink the green sauce all by itself. And, the chicken was piping hot and delicious, the green beans crunchy and savory, just how I like 'em!"}
{"text":"Good food...a little inconsistent. WAY too loud. Even my ten year old complained. We sat there in silence because we couldn't hear each other talk. The girls at the counter were nice but seemed unprepared/young and a bit clueless. AND, they need to SPEAK UP! Wish they had a drive thru! 

I literally had my hearing checked after this episode. It's very good."}
{"text":"Get the rotisserie chicken with the green sauce! It was a great go to for lunch. I also ordered the plantains with rice. The rice could have been a little better, but it was  good pairing with the chicken."}
{"text":"Holy Chicken!!!! I love this place. My favorite Yelp Buddy Nancy suggested we eat here. The food was amazing!!!

Parking is located across from the restaurant. This restaurant is small. We arrived around 5PM-- the after work crowd. Lots of small families with children. Walking in you experience the aroma of Peruvian Spices! Decided what to order---umm, one of everything? Lol I would've--No Shame

The restaurant is clean, and the staff is patient and helpful.

The food, I was contemplating what to order-- I opted for the Quinoa Chicken with Avocado with a lemonade! This is my FAVORITE!!!! I could eat this every day! Super healthy and full of flavor, the chicken was cooked to perfection!! Also there are sauces/dressings to add to your meal, sooo yummy!!! 

I feel like my time was limited here. I need to come back in the AM hours to enjoy everything this place has to offer."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and just realized I haven't reviewed it yet! I LOVE viva chicken. I'm so glad one of my co-workers told me about this place otherwise who knows when I would have come across it! 

I'm a creature of habit so I haven't tried too many different menu items but I plan to soon! I usually get the whole chicken with 3 sides for dinner so that we have leftovers for lunch the next day. The chicken is so good, it's so tasty and far from dry. The spice blend is perfect. And don't even get me started on the yellow sauce...omg I could put that on everything and I may be guilty of getting a few extra containers to bring home every time I get take out! 

We always get string beans as one side and then alternate the other two. We've had sweet potato fries, cilantro infused rice, side salad, and fried plantains all which are deeeelicious. My personal favorite are the plantains and fries, you can never go wrong with either! I need to try some new ones next time though! I've heard the quinoa stuffed avocados are amazing and I definitely will be trying those next time. 

The few times we've sat in the restaurant and ate were rear. Super friendly staff and really accommodating. The guy walking around was refilling our waters and making sure everything was ok which I didn't expect since it's not really a \"sit down\" restaurant where you are served. I'm impressed every time I eat there and always look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I'll give them a couple stars back because both the manager and owner reached out to apologize. Never any complaints about the food, but customers and their time should be of the upmost priority. I'll gladly give this location another try."}
{"text":"Holy crap, dude. Viva Chicken is the hero Charlotte needs and deserves. Is it possible to get cheap, ethnically accurate lunch with fresh, healthy ingredients prepared with a modern twist right here in the Queen City? Say it with me: \"Sí, se puede!\"

I went ahead and got a quarter chicken lunch with plantains and salad, even though the quinoa-stuffed avocado was gently whispering, \"Aubreyyyyy...\" in my ear. The Peruvian chicken is seasoned with just the right blend of South American spices to give it that extra succulent edge, but without overpowering the comforting taste of chicken we all know and love. Plantains are a winner every day. Dat salad doe...the dressing they put on it was INCREDIBLE. I won't go into great detail to describe it; I'll only say that you have to try it to believe it.

Based on all of the above, I would give Viva Chicken a five star review. But they get extra bonus points for having alfajores (more common to Argentina than Peru, but I won't tell anyone..... except you), having a chic, modern interior, and for playing a trendy mix of loungy club music that would put almost all the shittacular clubs in Uptown to shame. I mean, epic shame, dude. Most of those clubs fucking suck.

So, let's see: five stars for food, extra stars for alfajores, ambiance, and music, plus a few more because I'm feeling generous this morning...

12 stars...?"}
{"text":"Holy Jesus christ master off all things good and righteous, this food has changed me on a fundamental level. Please, sir, bring all the money you have."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best chicken I've ever eaten (anywhere).  A little pricey...  but it's ORGANIC ..  so I think the value is reasonable.  Love the aroma when you first arrive. If you are not hungry before you walk in the door, you will be instantly hungry the moment those spicy fragrances hit your senses.  They need to rework the sauce dispensing area.  The sauces are so good,  and people stand in line just to get the sauces..So they need a separate area for that, since it can get a little congested and is right next to the door that goes out to the patio.  Food was amazing. I've been there more than 10 times already."}
{"text":"Love this place. If you go, get the whole chicken as it comes with 3 huge portions of sides. The cilantro infused rice is a must as far as sides go. The red sauce is my favorite (warning: it's a bit spicy). Will go well with just about anything! Their specialty drinks are also great. They'll give you a sample if you have a hard time choosing. Last time I went here, there was a staff member that came to our table and was super helpful offering to get us to go boxes and extra sauces. This place is close to a stop on the Gold Rush Streetcar and is also close to bike stations too."}
{"text":"My job in Charlotte is OBSSESED with Viva Chicken. The best thing on the menu by far is their stuffed avocados. A normal dish comes with two halves of avocados stuffed with Quinoa over a bed of lettuce (get chicken on top). Doesn't sound like a lot but I couldn't even finish the second half! It is a great healthy lunch that isn't too much. Their chicken in general is very delicious. They also cater, so it is a great item to bring into work for those long days of work meetings."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  I was in Charlotte for work and was looking for someplace to go for lunch.  Did a quick Yelp search and Viva Chicken was my choice.  It had great reviews and was only five minutes from where I was working.

When I got there it was pretty busy but the line moves right along.  I ordered the quinoa stuffed avocado, with the pulled Peruvian rotisserie chicken and the homemade limeade. They give you a number to place on your table and they bring your order to you.

There's quite a bit of seating in the restaurant.  I didn't wait long for my food at all.  

All I can say is that this was the best lunch I have had in a long time.  The quinoa stuffed avocado was amazing, definitely get the pulled chicken with it.  The chicken is seasoned perfectly.  The homemade limeade is lime,basil, mint, and rosemary.  Amazing! 

I liked this place so much that I came back the next day and ordered the Andina power food salad, kale romaine mix, organic quinoa, seasonal fruit, edamame, toasted almonds, red peppers, avocado, with a lime passion fruit vinaigrette and of course the rotisserie chicken on top.  The salad was great and it is a good size salad.

I would definitely come back to try some of the other items on the menu.  Check this place out you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Hooray! So glad Viva Chicken opened a location in south Charlotte.

They've only been open two weeks and I've been twice. Once for to-go and another for dine-in.

Food is just as delicious as I remember from the Elizabeth location. Quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken? I think I could eat this everyday.

My only minor complaint is really just to let the owners & staff know (and I'm sure it's because they're new and working out the kinks) when dining in, please don't have your staff check on a table once every 2-3 minutes. I'm not even exaggerating. A few times, one worker was leaving our table after asking how we were doing as another approached to ask the same question. Literally - seconds apart. I know it seems crazy to complain about too much customer service, but that's what we experienced. My dining companion said she'd experienced the same thing earlier in the week.

The service at the original location is great - attentive without being overwhelming. I'm certain the Ballantyne location will get it figured out soon too."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I'll be back, for sure!

I wanted to try so many of their menu offerings, but opted for the highly recommended quinoa stuffed avocados. I shared sweet potato fries & plantains with a friend. It's fair to say I've been craving all three items since my visit last week.

There was plenty of staff working here on a weekday evening & they visited our table several times to check on us & offer water refills. 

Despite the summer heat, the covered patio in the evening, with the fans going was the perfect place to hang out with some friends.

The only drawback that gives me pause to make a quick stop on my way home from my uptown office is the parking situation. I ended up parking a block up the way on the street at a meter. My friends said there was some parking in nearby lots, but there's so much construction in this area right now & restricted lots for the hospital, I wasn't sure where I could park. Alas, a call to restaurant in advance didn't shed any light on available lots since they couldn't give me specifics about which lots were available for their diners."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and their herbal lemonade should be sold by the gallon. Only issue with this place is the music typically is loud and you're normally fighting for a seat if you have more than 2 people. It's completely worth going and I visit often. Don't want to fight for a seat-- take your food to go. I've never had issues with my order."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is soooo good! We got the whole chicken which comes with 3 sides. The sides served with the whole chicken are family style so it's more than enough to share! We got the house salad, the chicken soup, and the cilantro infused rice and an additional side of the yuca. The chicken is cooked on a rotisserie for 24 hours with all of these Peruvian spices. It's SO DAMN GOOD!!! They have tons of other options too...salads, wraps, sandwiches, fried rice :). All super delicious! Be sure to get the green sauce too, it's wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Quick and friendly service. Food came out in less than five minutes. I ordered the Taco Salad (with chicken) and my husband ordered Adinah salad (with chicken). Delicious and to die for. This place is priced perfectly because they give you a lot of food for your money. Coming from DC area, many restaurants need to take a lesson in quality service and qualify food from Viva. I will be coming back for the Belk Bowl in a few wks.."}
{"text":"The chicken is full of flavor. Always PERFECT.  Try the Herbal Lemonade."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Had to wait a bit as it was really busy at lunch time. But definitely worth the wait . Very fast and efficient servers and waiters. Loved the mint lemonade. Hope they expand locations soon."}
{"text":"Food was grrrreat! Service was fast, friendly and excellent! Loved the atmosphere and environment! I would recommend to anyone and will definitely be going back to eat there again! Was recommended by a friend prior."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken in the Ballantyne area...  same great menu as all the other locations, just different venue.  This shopping center is pretty popular across from Earthfare and also is home to the round-about that no one knows how to use properly, but there's a Midwood Smokehouse location here along with other stores of interest so its a prime location for Viva Chicken to be in.

Once you survive the parking lot, the front door has a set-up of rails like a Carowinds ride (for dine-in)... and then there's a separate register/pick up for online orders to the right near the drink machine.  Makes for a weird flow and there are two separate doors for each area...  probably makes sense when they are super busy, but I dined in and constantly saw people wandering in and not knowing where to go from the entrance.

Staff was nice and the food came out fast per usual.  The dining room has a smattering of tables and the high ceilings makes for some noise, but overall it's a great option for the folks at Ballantyne.  Looks like there's a covered outdoor seating area as well, but there weren't many people cause it was a cold day when I went."}
{"text":"Love this new location of Viva chicken! It's so much better laid out than the original location and a lot bigger on this inside than it appears from the outside. 

Inside there's a line where you can place your order.  On my initial visit I ordered the 1/2 chick with Yuca and their cilantro rice. They also suckered me into one of their specialty drinks, the herbal limeade.

On the opposite side of the restaurant, there's a counter for all the sauces - I forget the names of the sauces but all of them are delicious but I think my favorite is the green sauce. I found myself dipping the chicken, the yuca, and smothering the rice in the sauce.

The chicken is flavorful. The meat is tender. The yuca was a nice change from usual fries. The rice on its own was a bit disappointing but mixed with their sauces it was fantastic. The limeade had a nice basil flavor but it was a bit too sweet for me.

The one thing that concerned me about this location when I saw it being built was parking. There was only a small parking lot for the building unless they had approval to park in the office lot next door and that's what they did. So don't let parking worry you. There's a sign stating you can park in the neighboring lot. Whew! 

I love this place and their food. Definitely glad to see them expanding!"}
{"text":"Gluten Free - Yes, item specific
Casein Free - Yes, item specific

Viva Chicken offers Peruvian fare to the masses without losing its flavor. This local chain(?), also with a single location in Utah., offers a quick, cheap, and filling meal that doesn't skimp on the quality. 

Notes/highlights: 

+The Ballantyne location is tucked into the Shops at Toringdon. Though the outside design does make it stand out from the other business in the same strip

+ Request an allergen menu if you are unfamiliar with their offering. With the exclusion of a few items, there is a relatively high number of GF items as well as CF items.

***Sadly the plantains are NOT gluten free as they are fried in a shared fryer and the risk of cross contamination is quite high. I was impressed that individual helping me at the counter was aware of this and extremely knowledgeable about their allergen menu and able to communicate the risks without me having to ask or offering this information.

+ On nicer days, there is an open patio type space to enjoy your meal, or you can dine indoors, though it is a bit louder.

+ Price - cheap for the quantity and quality of food provided

+ Service was friendly and extremely helpful

Tips: 

- Parking can be a pain, especially during the lunch time rush, so account for extra time if your leaving the office

+ They offer online ordering, which will require you to setup an account. I'd recommend it during the lunch rush/"}
{"text":"Loveee Viva Chicken! The \"maracuya\" juice is to die for. I ordered the lomo saltado, it was so good,  we took a whole chicken home and it was delicious , loved the sweet potatos!"}
{"text":"We were in Concord for a wedding, and looking for something light to eat so we don't starve before dinner tonight.  I thought Peruvian chicken sounded good, so we tried it.  I got the Cobb salad and added pulled chicken.  My husband got 1/2 chicken with fries and a side salad.  My salad was flavorful
And fresh - loved it!  There was just enough salad dressing - seriously, the perfect amount!  My husband's meal started bad because his fries were cold.  He told a young man who looked at him and said, \"Cold fries?\" as if it were unimportant.  That (of course) ticked him off.  He did ultimately get fresh, hot fries, and his meal was good.  I also had the passion fruit juice, which was great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible restaurant, great atmosphere service and prices. The chicken is so good!! I just wish we had them back home in St. Louis! I will definitely be coming back every time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We tried take out one night and were pleasantly surprised. I am so glad we can add this to our rotation of regular spots. We ordered a Caesar salad and a whole chicken that comes with 3 sides so we did the Cilantro rice, green beans and plantains. The chicken was super moist and flavorful. This is no supermarket rotisserie chicken! The sides were awesome the green beans have a soy and ginger sauce they are cooked in. Delicious! 
We also tried a bunch of sauces with the chicken, they were so good it was hard to choose which was the best. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"An excellent meal with excellent sauces.  Definitely worth stopping here for a meal.   The salad are great and the other meals look awesome. You will be happy to have stop here.  It is right in front of Presbytrian (Novant) hospital. Main hospital."}
{"text":"Ive been here three times now. Each time theyve been ridiculously busy. The food is GREAT!!! Love everything ive ordered, but the layout of this restaurant makes you wanna scream. Theres no flow from line you wait in to order, to soda machines, to trying to gind a seat..
 Its terrible."}
{"text":"Dear restaurant owners, PLEASE COME TO DURHAM!! Love everything about this place. Panera-style ordering with great service and insanely good food. Don't miss the refreshing herbal lemonade and melt-in-your-mouth alfajores!"}
{"text":"Great chicken.  Love the green sauce and the cilantro rice.  Passion fruit drink is awesome too.  Must try it.  Too bad they don't get free refills.  Rotisserie chicken but they have chicken fingers for kids."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  The chicken fell off the bone and the 3 dip sauces were out of this world.   I will be back and definitely recommend.  

I ordered half a chicken with plantains and cilantro rice and a Ceasars salad.   The salad had lots of cheese and artichokes which gave it a yummy different flavor."}
{"text":"Oh man! This is such a great addition to the Charlotte community.

I love independent businesses. I love helping community. I love good food. This place is a favorite. 

The heart warming stuff- they work a lot with the homeless community. I cannot stress enough how incredible I find this. This makes me trust these guys. This is why local businesses are so important. They are INVOLVED in what is going on in our community. 

The delicious stuff- the food is seriously good. The Quinoa stuffed avocado is a delight (IT IS HUGE). The chicken is always moist. The sauces are delicious (especially the yellow sauce). I absolutely love coming here and ordering a couple of appetizers, sides and chicken. We eat it for multiple days. IT IS AMAZING.

There is a little outdoor area that is very nicely done.

Oh- and they were open during the snow days. These people are serious about their chicken."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place through numerous people, and they've all said it was a good place to eat.  I gave it a try a while back, and I have to say that this place doesn't disappoint! 

I definitely recommend their Incan wrap (I add chicken with mine). Their wraps are fulfilling to where I usually have to take the other half home to eat later.  Their chicken soup is also really good!  Their herbal lemonade is definitely something different, but in a good way.

If you're looking for something different and not greasy, this is a great place to try out!  It can be a bit on the higher side with price, but I do feel that you are getting what you pay for."}
{"text":"Yes.  Eat here.  Now.

We came on Sunday right before the lunch rush and found a table in their outside patio in the middle of January.  The heat lamps were a real plus, as we never felt uncomfortable without our coats.  A friendly busboy helped us find takeout menus since we'd never been there before (and most people order off their posted menu, like Chipotle) and then gave us some recommendations.  

We followed those and got Quinoa-stuffed Avocados (awesome), the Great sandwich (should be the Good sandwich, but still solid), and a 1/4 Chicken with Yuca fries and Fried Plantains (so, so, so good).  The sauces were incredible, the food was much better than I expected, and the price was ridiculously low for the food we consumed that day.  You can tell all the ingredients are fresh and real, something hard to find these days.

We will be back regularly now that we've tried it.  Flavorful, different, and memorable.  It's 8am, and I want to go eat a chicken.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"avocado quinoa dish rocks!  purple natural drink is really different and no added sugars.  just the best place for a quick meal that's healthy as well."}
{"text":"Great flavor and amazing atmosphere,friendly staff too! I'll be back for another quick bite very soon."}
{"text":"We really love the food here but they really need to pay attention to portion sizes on their to go orders.  Ordered the whole chicken and sides.  The container of beans was 3/4 liquid with about 1/4 cup of beans, if that.  There were only 8 yuca fries and they were very small. but This wasn't reasonable for 3 people, especially given that beans are dirt cheap and I'm sure the yuca isn't  too pricey either.

I've noticed this becoming a trend, and I think when you are paying these prices the portions should at least not leave you hungry.  This is not the first time that I have had to eye the food worried that everyone wouldn't even get a small serving of the sides.  Last time we had guests and had spent a lot, and we barely had enough for a first serving."}
{"text":"I really like Viva Chicken over all.  There is a good variety of items, the food is prepared well and quickly and is a good portion size.  It is a little pricy for lunch I think, but worth the splurge.

I love the service... the staff are very prompt and willing to help you.  I like that staff stays on the dining floor to keep things clean.  There is no-one that just stands around doing nothing.

I like and will drive to the location at Park Road even though when I pick up my sweetie we are closer to Elizabeth."}
{"text":"I think this a great take on fast-food.  Limited seating is available and it can be hard to find a place to sit although it turns over fairly quickly.

The food is fresh and good.  I had salad with avocado and pineapple and added chicken.  Chicken was moist and plentiful.  I took some home!

I hope the three stars doesn't put people off.  I really enjoyed it, I just want to be conservative on this first review.  I hope to visit again soon and add a star!"}
{"text":"Rotisserie chicken seasoned to PERFECTION! A nice, healthy alternative for lunch, dinner, etc. Cilantro in fused rice was yummy too. The Churros are to diiiieeeee for o__O"}
{"text":"This is a must visit restaurant. The food was amazing and was such a treat. The overall setup and feel of the location is pleasant and the line flows at a quick pace. The only negative is the fruit cup is lacking mellon."}
{"text":"Very good Peruvian Chicken.  We split a 1/2 chicken with 3 sides.  Everything tasted very fresh and was full of flavor.  We would eat here again.  A great alternative to normal fast food."}
{"text":"Love the experience! I have tried several things on the menu and each one is better than the last! All of the food tastes fresh and light! My new favorite spot for lunch."}
{"text":"One of our go-to dinner spots. Absolutely delicious,  chill atmosphere, and amazing service! I always get the 1/4 chicken and it's always moist with lots of flavor! My husband likes to get the wraps (great wrap is his favorite) and they are always pretty generous in size. 

This is a good spot to come to with a group, or to get takeout, or even come to on a date. Technically it's fast casual, but the servers constantly come around to check on you and get you refills, so it feels like a more upscale restaurant. We usually sit out in the terrace, and the manager will even come check on us and ask if we need the music down or the heater on. It really feels like a cheers-type restaurant even though it's a chain. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love the authentic Peruvian food!! I can convince my friends to try it because of all of the delicious sauce choices!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food for a good price. I ordered the whole chicken (comes with 3 sides) and the classic saltado for about $35. It was more than enough to feed a hungry family of four, and we even had leftovers. 
I did a takeout order online- and arrived early for pickup but they were able to deliver quickly! Extremely fast and friendly service- they were able to have it ready 10 minutes earlier for us. 
The chicken is well spiced and not dry. The sauces are amazing, especially the green one. They aren't too spicy like hot sauce, but instead are very flavorful and have the right amount of kick. 
It's a bit of a drive for me, but definitely worth it. We used to like a Peruvian place called Genaro's but it closed down and this is a great replacement for our rotisserie cravings."}
{"text":"This isn't anything exotic, although it is new.  Think of this as an alternate version of Boston Market.  The prices aren't anything to get excited about.  The menu has the usual suspects, fried root vegetables that try to hide the fact they are terrible for You (I'm looking at you yuca).

The food is fine, or ok.  For me this isn't an incentive to go out to eat.  I would rather stay in."}
{"text":"I am in love with their Quinoa! I come in just to buy a large side order! 
I would give 5 stars BUT I have 2 buts:
If you have children in a stroller it is hard/ impossible to navigate through their line turnstile.
I am a big fan of the herbal lemonade but I must had gotten the first pour of the day so I got half a cup of pulp and sediment. Make sure you taste before you leave, I had to run the juice through a strainer when I got home...
These are two minor things, I will continue to frequent this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I think we hit Viva Chicken on an off day.  When we got there the line was almost out the door (which is normally a good sign) but come to find out their computers were down.  Instead of waiting in the long line, we decided to order our food through their app which came in handy.  The food was good but had a hard time giving it more than 3 stars.  I'd definitely go back but there are many other restaurants in Charlotte higher on my list.  

I ordered the half chicken with 2 sides (cilantro infused rice, sweet plantains) and the Quinoa stuffed Advocado's.  The chicken was tender and went well with the two different sauces it came with.  The Quinoa stuffed Advocado was full of flavor and very unique - would definitely recommend ordering.  The sides were just OK."}
{"text":"GREAT lunch spot. I always order ahead so I don't have to wait in line during the rush. This has become the spot that I go to when I didn't bring lunch from home. The Great Wrap and plantains cannot be beat! I have tried the chicken with sides, as well as the Viva Chicken Salad and there is no fault that can be found. I'm so glad this is a convenient stop, close to work. They also have one in Ballantyne, which is great when I'm at home and the craving strikes."}
{"text":"Back again for another Naked Peruvian! Scrumptious like the first time, and on top of that the Passionfruit juice is absolutely amazing here. Plus, I finally tried the dessert and I must say I'm impressed! The churros and the Mil Hojas were so good! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The worst tres leches  ... very disappointed it wasn't like that before .....  now its so dry and it doesn't taste good"}
{"text":"Cute spot for lunch or a quick bite. Service was so so but the food hit the spot. Definitely try the plantains"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food they prepare is excellent, and the cost is relatively cheap for what you get. The way they prepare their meats is great and full of flavor. I highly recommend stopping by and trying their unique and tasty cuisine."}
{"text":"I have a hard time not waxing poetic about this place. We took my husband here for his birthday because it's become our go-to spot for healthy, flavorful comfort food and it has never disappointed. NEVER.

Between us we've tried almost everything on the menu and each have our favorites. Arroz Chaufa is his, usually with chicken, and the stuffed avocado with quinoa is probably mine, though I would walk a mile through snow in bare feet to get to a fresh order of their plantains. He's also returned several times to the traditional saltado.

Then there are the sauces. Holy crow, the sauces.

What he does - and I started doing - when he gets the Arroz Chaufa is to put a stripe of each of the three sauces across the top of the dish so you can mix the flavors if you want or enjoy them separately. My favorite is the yellow sauce, his the green. If you get takeout, be sure to hit the sauce bar to get extra before you leave."}
{"text":"My husband is obsessed with this place. I've only eaten here twice and both times have been very good. I most recently enjoyed the 1/4 rotisserie chicken with a side salad and fried yuca. I also tried the yellowish sauce. Everything is great. Very original food and good service. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian style restaurant in Charlotte NC. I frequently eat here for lunches and at times dinner when I get a chance to bring my Daughter."}
{"text":"At The Best Peruvian Restaurant in the Park Rd, Charlotte, NC.

I travel around Charlotte, NC and Indian Trail, NC, I have visited and reviewed most of their locations. Fast & Friendly Service."}
{"text":"Sun Valley's Best! Best Peruvian Restaurant In Indian Trail, NC -Charlotte ROAD ANGELS Welcomes VIVA to the 28079."}
{"text":"I'm only doing this for a couple of reasons :  this is one of my favorite Peruvian rotisserie chicken restaurants and I would hate to see it getting sloppy and because I leave so close I order and eat there often, hope this helps improve.
We decided to order out this time, it's cold out we are watching the Saints loose the division game (shamelessly) and we didn't feel like going anywhere. Well, my chicken was undercooked, a bit bloody near the bone  very disappointed because i didn't want to go back out to restaurant and bring it back and face that Waverley traffic that is getting worst by the minute and I'm pretty sure I just got a bit of a stomachache. This place is great in service and I've never gotten bad food before, I can see it's always busy, has become one of the most popular places in the new park. If you read this please keep an eye on your food quality you don't want to risk clientele or even worse get people sick.

1/15 Update :

I was contacted by Viva Chicken with an apology for my experience, this speaks loud of their excellent service and will to continue being one of he best, thanks for listening to your customers :) I will continue going to your restaurant and invite all to try their food if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Fast service, great food options, nice employees, chilling atmosphere! I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been here five or six times, and I've loved it each visit. The 1/4 chicken is good, and I've enjoyed the fries, canary beans and cilantro rice as sides. All white meat is .75 cent upcharge, which is worth it. The green sauce (Huacatay Sauce) is good, but too spicy for my tastes. I recently tried the yellow sauce (mild, Aji Amarillo) and I'm mad at myself for not trying it earlier because it is yummy. 

My favorite dish is the Arroz Chaufa (fried rice) with chicken. The Viva Tacu Bowl is good too, think like a Chipotle burrito bowl, but I wouldn't order it again because the canary beans got to be too spicy for me. I've only tried their Herbal Lemonade specialty drink, and it is cool and refreshing. I tried their lunch special today (the 1/4 chicken with 1 side and drink for $5.95) and it was a great deal! My sister tried their the Great rotisserie chicken sandwich yesterday and loved it.

 I will definitely come back to Viva Chicken often and try out the rest of their menu. I highly recommend this place, and it's wonderful they are opening a 2nd location in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Ordered the rotisserie chicken infused cilantro rice with plantains and it was very good!!  Spice it up with their sauces yum!"}
{"text":"Great chicken, but please don't go when they are close to closing, they guys sweep around your feet and table while you are still eating. Very rude , even after I asked that he wait until I finish eating . Management needs to address this issue with the cleaners."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is our new favorite fast-service restaurant. Everything that we have eaten here has been fresh and delicious. The rice is always perfect texture and the chicken is always moist and delicious. Toppings are always bright and fresh and the prices are very reasonable, especially for the quality.  Their housemade sauces are excellent as well. Sangria is my favorite. It packs a punch and is always topped with delicious fresh fruit (apples, oranges, pineapple, etc).

Service is always super friendly and the restaurant is consistently spotless."}
{"text":"I had some time to kill so thought I'd try this new location.  It's another place using the \"clearly confusing\" Chipotle business model which I do not enjoy, but I'm already inside so I keep going.  It'll either blow my socks off enough to come back or it won't.  Of course they have a timid little girl whispering at the register which also irritates me because this is my first visit and I need some guidance.  

I ordered a Tacu Bowl with chicken and a Basil, Rosemary, mint drink.  The drink is outstanding, but it's too thick to drink it with a meal, so I had to go back and order a pepsi which was over $2.00!  Keep in mind this is a plastic cup, pour it yourself kind of place, so $2.00 for a fountain pepsi I think is too much.

My bowl was tasty, but had way too many beans in it.  I thought it was pricey for what I ended up with.  I wasn't bowled over by any part of my visit, so I don't think I'll be going back, but if you enjoy this type of food and environment, you'll probably enjoy your time there."}
{"text":"Their rotisserie chicken is the best!  Love the green sauce and the yuca. However I'm not as big a fan of their beans. Enjoy the beans at pio pio better bc they taste more authentic."}
{"text":"I had heard from all of my co-workers that I HAD to try Viva Chicken. The way they were raving you would have thought Viva Chicken invented sliced bread. I finally broke and checked it out. I went with their recommended dish of Arroz Chaufa with Chicken (basically fried rice). I also got sides of all of their sauces because I had heard they were essential to the experience. 
I don't know if it was them constantly telling me how good it was/going to be, or just my visit, but I was immensely disappointed. It was ok, but I would take normal asian fried rice over this any day. They were fast and the sauces definitely added a different flavor, but I wasn't over the moon with the Arroz Chaufa. Maybe next time my co-workers go I will try something else and will have the same amazing experience they all had."}
{"text":"Stuffed avocado with chicken - enough said. It was great to find a new place to get healthy, innovative, affordable, and delicious food! Perfect for take out after work. On top of that, the staff is friendly and the service is all around great. 5 stars, no doubt."}
{"text":"Great food! Sauces are amazing. The yellow sauce is my favorite. The pulled \"great\" chicken sandwich is amazing! I love avocado on my sandwiches and the combination of toppings is a fantastic taste. Staff is great! Also almost everything is compostable and recyclable."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked into Viva Chicken everything just unfolded perfectly. Incredibly nice servers asked us if we had been there before, they suggested I sample some fresh juice, and made recommendations on their specialties.

 As mentioned below, Viva has a fast-food set-up but the food is fresh and lovingly prepared. I went with \"The Great\" sandwich with avocado and plantains and my husband went with the pork sandwich La Butifarra with sweet potato fries. The sandwiches are served on the best Ciabatta I've ever had (soft on the inside light and crisp on the outside). My husband's sandwich was the better of the two, but both were exceptionally good. The meat very much has that distinct wood-fired flavor that when combined with the sauces, veggies, and bread is heavenly. My plantains were nice and caramelized - I would definitely order them again next time. 

They are very eco-conscious here and surprisingly have a large selection of veg-friendly options (I counted 8). They also have a lot of Asian inspired dishes which I can't wait to try. 

The outdoor area would make a great place to grab a bite to eat with a friend/date, it also is completely covered in herbs/plants which makes for a very cool vibe. The only tiny suggestion I would make is to turn the techno-beats a tad down during the lunch hour. 

My hubby and I both agreed we can't wait to return for another one of those mouth-watering sandwiches. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"OMG...don't miss this.  Excellent food.  You order at the counter.  I had a rice dish and had chicken added.  Was so delicious.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Super delicious & healthy!! The green beans were absolutely amazing!! Will be making a trip back ASAP"}
{"text":"Great place! Wish we had one in Roanoke (VA).  Service was quick & food & drinks very tasty! My daughter's fried rice dish was awesome; I'm getting this next visit. I liked the variety of healthy options, organic & many foods had a bit of spice (heat) that I like! They had an attendant that checked on us regularly, even though it was a Crowded Sunday during peak lunch rush. The gal that took our order was very helpful, too since we'd never been here before. Only downside was the noise level. Oh, and the bathroom was very clean."}
{"text":"Chicken and corn salad was amazing. Can't wait to go again and try something new. Always busy but I ordered online and pick up was ready at requested time. Friendly staff. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"This is a very good low cost, high quality rotisserie chicken joint with a Peruvian spice twist.  All around solid.  Try the yucca fries and plantains as a side.  Absolutely delicious.  Not much more to say that this.  There's no way you won't enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Like with any other Viva Chicken, I love the place! Lot's of delicious Peruvian-style meals with chicken as an option (despite the name). Basically every menu item has a vegetarian version standard. Chicken costs extra. Lots of teas/juices to choose from, local beers in cans and even sangria. All of the utensils, plates, bowls and cups are either biodegradable or recyclable. I don't suggest you come to this location for lunch on a weekday unless you have the time to wait. It's difficult to get in here and back to the office in under an hour unless you're close enough to walk from work. They definitely get hit hard and it can be overwhelmingly crowded. Last but not least, value and volume for your money here are always great. I suggest getting the arroz chaufa with chicken or the quinoa stuffed avocado (full order!)."}
{"text":"How many Viva Chicken locations have I reviewed now? God I love this place. And now there's this new location dangerously close to home. Arroz chaufa, rotisserie style pulled chicken and quinoa stuffed avocado. Where can I go wrong?

Honestly even the prices are a perfect match to the food at every Viva Chicken. You can't possibly leave here hungry. The arroz chaufa is a seriously huge portion. These days I almost never finish it in one sitting. No mind, lunch for tomorrow! They have some (usually local) beers available and lots of good house made drink options. Don't hold off on the sauces. Not sure what they're called, but the yellow is best closely followed by the spicier green one.

I've never been disappointed by service at any location although my biggest dislike would be the noisiness. I guess that's what popularity gets you! The icing on the cake for me is that they're incredibly environmentally friendly with most of their entirely disposable dish and utensil line-up being plant-based and compostable. Viva!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this gem. Everything is supes fresh and full of flavor. Don't be afraid to try something you've never had here and add a side of plantains, no matter what! S'good. Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"Viva chicken is a bi weekly staple in our house!!!   The arroz is amazing.  The portions are huge and I highly recommend at least 3 tubs of yellow sauce.  The sauce makes the meal. 

I also love the andina power food salad.  Add feta cheese to it and you won't regret it.  Since I'm obsessed with the yellow sauce, I use that as my dressing.

The quinoa stuffed avacados are delish and could be eaten as a meal.... with the yellow sauce of course!!  

Viva is fast, delicious, and fresh.  They even have a cute patio out back!  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered viva to go again for the second time in the past two weeks!  It never disappoints!  Our favorites are the Arroz con chaufa, the stuffed avocados and the great.  Make sure you check out their new sauce bar.  The yellow sauce makes the meal.  They also offer a rewards program for each dollar you spend!"}
{"text":"Got one of the best salads I've had in a while! The limena chopped has roasted chickpeas, edamame, queso fresco, jalepeno bacon, peruvian corn. Just listen to those toppings! Added pulled chicken of course and also got an herbal limeade (mmm). Boyfriend got the two piece chicken plate with fries and a side salad. Not nearly as exciting as my meal IMO. The food was great, and the cashiers were friendly. The setup needs a little work. We went at prime dinner time and almost the whole time we were there someone was filling up tea jugs (for catering orders I assume) so it was hard for anyone to get to the sauces and drinks which are all shoved into a tiny corner. Speaking of sauces-- mmm the green one. This would be a great option for togo food, they even have a seperate line for pickup orders."}
{"text":"The food here has a lot of flavor but that's about all it has going for it. You pay $10 for Arroz Chaufa with chicken and you get about three ounces of meat. It's all rice and a complete rip off. I tried to get extra chicken and they tried to charge me an extra $5."}
{"text":"I have been a long-time fan of Viva Chicken (specifically the one in Ballantyne, if that is important), so when we noticed that they had added yet another location, this one near Concord Mills, we decided to stop in.

To begin, it's unbelievable how this area continues to find places to add new businesses. But they do. That is neither here nor there when it comes to Viva, but I just thought I'd mention it.

Beyond that, this location isn't too different than the Ballantyne one, so if you've been there, you'll likely be familiar here. Still, there is something... different. Most noticeable is probably the light. It just seems to be a little off. Where in Ballantyne it's a bit intimate - not romantic, but just dim and moody or something - here it is coming in at an odd angle and so you feel that things are not lit quite right.

Aside from that totally irrelevant item, the staff at the counter is friendly, and they are happy to give you a taste of a drink or help you to figure out your order, though their description of items can be a bit off. For instance, the solterito was described as \"spicy corn\", when in reality it had some of those monstrous corn kernels, and a bit of a kick, but really it had other things in there (I don't even know everything) - I think there were beans and definitely some cheese, but beyond that, it was more than spicy corn. 

Still, all was good, and it's just that more details would be useful. Unfortunately the service at this location, while friendly, has a tendency to be a bit slow - it took a while for food to come out, and some of the tables would gather a bit before being cleaned. All in all not bad, but I just prefer the Ballantyne location a bit more."}
{"text":"Rotisserie chicken Peruvian style is one of my favorites, and viva does not disappoint. The chicken is well-seasoned with herbs and their sauces are decent. I always get the fried yucca as a side and sometimes their plantains (maduros/sweet and ripe fried plantains).

The price point is great. It is a quick-service restaurant - so you go to the counter and order and they bring out your food. Their covered patio is nice, but finding a table at lunch is sometimes difficult."}
{"text":"This place is so good! We had heard about this place from a friend and thought, \"oh it must be just one of those places\" but no, this is a gem! For starters, the quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken... wow! It is the best form of avocado I've had, and that includes the very delicious guacamole! It is also rather filling so I just decided to have it as an entree instead of an appetizer or a side. Also, the chicken! It's mind blowing. I have no idea what they marinate it with, but whatever they use has to be made with something unicorns and rainbows! I'm a fan of dark meat chicken and my boyfriend loves white meat so the half chicken is perfect for us. Oh and the huacatay sauce! That's my favorite and my boyfriend loves the milder Aji Amarillo Sauce. I want that stuff on everything I eat!! This time we also happened to order the Arroz Chaufa which is a kind of fried rice which I'm definitely getting again next time! The sides are very delicious too... My favorite are the yucca fries and plantain fries and my boyfriend loves the cilantro rice. Oh and the Inca soda! It's kind of a cream soda.

Overall this place is amazing. if you've never been here, now would be the time to try it. And if you've never had Peruvian food, then this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but good things about this place and always wanted to try it. So glad I finally got to today.You order at the counter and take a number and find a spot to sit and they serve you your food. There were about 8 people in front of us and I was surprised at how fast the line was going! Guy at the counter was really helpful and friendly. We gave him our order and he thanked us for coming here for dinner. 

We each got the half chicken and two side items. Chicken was juicy and delicious!! Half chicken was so big I could only finish half of it. I got cilantro infused rice and chicken soup. Rice was good and not dry. There was little flavor to it but every now and then I would get a kick of cilantro flavor. There were small pieces of carrots and peas in it. Soup was good. I wish you could get a bigger version of it. There was pulled chicken in it. It had rice and red onions and peppers in it. Very good and flavorful. It would be perfect for a cold day or even if you were sick. I got the \"gringo killer\" sauce. It went so well with the chicken and rice. 

My fiance got green beans. The beans had chopped red peppers in it. He also got the quinoa. He was surprised it was served cold and he loved it! It had cilantro, red onions and peppers in it. He wasn't sure what type of sauce was in it but he loved it. He used the green sauce for his chicken which was mint and jalapeno base. 

This restaurant was super clean and so was the bathroom. The staff was really friendly. We had someone that worked there walk up to our table and asked how everything was. There was also a guy that worked there that did such an awesome job cleaning the restaurant and give excellent customer service. He was cleaning tables so fast so people can sit down and eat. He was also walking by and offering to take your empty plates. He cleaned the drink and sauce station. 

I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, place is clean and food is amazing - the managers are helpful and polite. My favorite is the stuffed avocado chicken quinoa salad - I have to get it at least once a wk.  make sure you get the passion fruit drink too - it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been to Viva Chicken several times but this was my first time at this location. We came around 11:15 am and they weren't busy at all. I'm sure if it got closer to 12 it would be packed. We ordered right away and got a booth by the window. 

I got the 1/4 chicken with the rice and soup. The chicken was so tender and fall off the bone. The rice adds a nice touch to it. I was so full by then I took my soup home. The soup is my favorite part. It's so flavorful and perfect for a cold night!! 

Service was good and the restaurant was super clean!"}
{"text":"Went here with hubby on a Saturday afternoon due to the great reviews and many healthier/whole food options. He had The Big sandwich and added avocado and sweet potato fries. He said it was delicious, fresh ingredients and quality chicken. I had the stuffed quinoa avocado and added chicken. Portion size was more than enough to have leftovers. Mine was very very tasty and like nothing I ever had before. There was a good amount of romaine and tomatoes added so it felt like a salad. Service was good. Restrooms were clean and even though it was busy, there seems to be plenty of staff to make sure tables and the wonderful sauce bar was maintained. Definitely will be back to try some of the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food.. Great atmosphere.... Insanely amazing herbal  lemonade.  Kids and parents approved!"}
{"text":"This place has absolutely awesome food.This is my first time tasting Peruvian and its a 100% great experience. Also the prices are moderate.We tried the quarter chicken with two sides ( sweet potato fries and fresh fruits), the chicken was so moist and the seasoning is absolutely delicious.We also tried the avocado stuffed with quinoa and it was too good."}
{"text":"If anyone from Viva chicken is reading this... PLEASE!!! Bring one to NEW YORK!  it would do so incredibly well up here!  

My husband and I came here for dinner last night.  All I could say is that I wish there was a spot like this in NY!   The main chicken selections are rotisserie style.  I ordered the 1/4 chicken which came with two sides.  I selected the chicken soup based on reviews and the cilantro infused rice.  

The chicken was one of the best rotisserie's I've ever had.  I normally don't eat the chicken skin but this time I did, bring it was nice and crispy and packed with flavor.   After you order your meal, over on the side there's a variety of sauces you can try (I have them pictured), the Aji armadillo sauce (mild yellow Peruvian pepper) and the huacatay sauce (black Peruvian mint, fresh cilantro and jalapeño) were my favorite.  I was also a little bold and combined those two sauces together and formed a love child lol.  Seriously- try it!   I topped it over the cilantro rice.  

The chicken soup was unlike anything I ever saw or had.  Packed with herbs, onions, chives, and deliciousness.  Initially when it was brought to me I honestly thought it was the wrong order but after further inspection I came to realize how uniquely beautifully this dish was.  Also- don't leave before trying the Yuka.  

I hope to come back once more before we go home."}
{"text":"I never leave bad reviews, nor do I mind a busy or crowded place but the staff really made it a bad experience. One of their bussers hit me with the door on the way in and didn't acknowledge or apologize. After ordering my to go lunch, I waited 15 minutes with others orders/names being shouted out who had placed their orders AFTER me. When I finally got to catch a manager I asked if they could check on it and he saw that I had been waiting for almost 20 minutes and that no one even started my order. He had someone make it and bring it out but never once apologized or said thanks for being patient. Love Viva-Chicken but not this location!!!!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is not only hip and healthy, it's quick and convenient and a great spot for dine-in or takeout."}
{"text":"Excellent food that is fresh and well executed.  We had the whole chicken with cilantro rice, fries and plantains and everything was delicious!  Drinks and local beer were also good.  So excited to see that they are also opening a location in North Hills.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great chicken dishes & best French fries I have ever had! Green beans are a great side there as well. We really like the rice bowls as well. A bit crowded sometimes & parking is terrible, but that's true of most of the Waverly complex."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience with this location today. I placed the order online and ahead of time, to my disappointment my order was not ready. When I got there the cashier looked around for my food and when she couldn't find it she told her coworker to place my order. I requested my order to be cancelled since I was on my lunch break and couldn't wait for them to make my food (I had already been there for a couple of minutes waiting for my order to be found), so the cashier went ahead and grabbed her manager. The manager grabbed a bag that was sitting on their to-go rack and insisted to the cashier that the bag he was holding was my order (which was not). He eventually started to cancel my order and process the refund, as he was doing that he advised me my food was sent back because I got there about 20 minutes after the time I requested my food to be ready. Then he told me the refund was going to be sent back to my card, I requested a receipt or something showing it was indeed going to be refunded & he said \"no, we don't have that\". 

In total I was there longer then I needed to be. I am extremely upset they took it upon themselves to get rid of my (already PAID) order instead of calling me to re-confirm whether or not I was going to pick it up. I will never return here, customer service doesn't seem to be one of their top priorities."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great food, great service. The atmosphere is nice and they play nice music looks like an upscale chipotle"}
{"text":"When I am looking for a meal I can pick up on nights I work late and dont have time to cook, I pick up viva chicken. I had just attended a conference accross the street and couldnt resist picking up an avocado bowl with pulled rotisserie chicken before heading to my next appointment. I love that you can order half which is more than enough for me. Here, it is ALL ABOUT THE SAUCES! They are each delicious and I love them equally the same. If you are taking it to go, dont forget to take home plenty of sauces. Trust me you will see people just loading up on these! I found this location to be consistent with the others in Charlotte. It was clean, fast, and the staff was very friendly. I always receive the correct order which I appreciate. I would also suggest the cliantro rice! Yummers!"}
{"text":"This is a great location! Not only is it conveniently located in Midtown but the ingredients and end products are so fresh and delicious. As with any Viva chicken, the sauces is where the magic is at. DO NOT FORGET TO TRY THE SAUCES. Some of my favorite dishes include the bowls and salads. The cilantro lime rice is delicious. The dining area is always clean. The staff are very accomadating here as well. The only downside to this Viva is the parking, they share a lot with Jimmy Johns and there is not much parking there, I often have to park in the office buildings lot next door."}
{"text":"Viva chicken....fast, fresh, different. I have to say that the quinoa stuffed avocado or the tacu bowl are my favorite. Get the chicken! Come on...you know that's why you came here. The sauces make the dish so make sure to try them all. this location is right next to my work and is very dangerous because I will come here a lot. They have the best service!"}
{"text":"The Quinoa stuffed avocado was amazing! The flavors were so good together. The canary beans were like spicy pinto beans and they were yummy. Will go back!! Busy place at lunch."}
{"text":"The 1/4 chicken had no meat on it and was not good. Canary beans good. Yucca fries excellent. Passion fruit excellent."}
{"text":"Outstanding little eatery. Their stuffed avocados are out of this world! Thank you for bringing this place to Indian Trail!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. it's a convenient place i visited a couple times when i was in Ballantyne area"}
{"text":"Too close to home! This location is great for us, it's busy but there's always some space, and a nice semi-outdoors one too. If you haven't had their Peruvian chicken, then get that first along with the cilantro rice. It's a great alternative to all the fried chickens out there in Charlotte. The whole chicken and 3 sides deal is pretty good for 2 people, but not if you're hungry. I now get the arroz chaufa w/ chicken and she gets the tacu bowl which adds more substance for the $10 each price point. We usually pass on the desserts, minus the fried plantains, which is really considered a side. Yep, definitely get the fried plantains."}
{"text":"I love viva chicken - the food is so good my review could be bias being that nothing can effect my mood when i am about to eat some vivas! I love that they have healthy options and offer variety of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Whatever you order, don't forget the cilantro infused rice. It completes any dish! Service was fast and friendly. Will definitely be back to this location. I'll even try some dessert!"}
{"text":"Really loved my first experience eating here. I've really been missing good Peruvian food after moving from Raleigh and Mami Nora's! I was surprised to find that the food here was very comparable! We ordered a whole chicken and 3 sides (yuca fries, quinoa and salad) between two people. The portions were huge, we ate our fill and had some to take to-go. The salad wasn't worth getting but their chicken was so very delicious. They also had all the great classic sauces (not sure the names- but the green one and the yellow one!). The place was very busy and crowded. I would probably choose to take my food to-go next time! but the server was also very courteous. Overall, really great food and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner last week and I'm so glad we did! This was a great experience all the way around! The food was excellent!! It was so fresh and flavorful. Wonderful option for eating clean food that tastes amazing!! The service was fantastic!! We will definitely be eating here again! So glad this place came to town!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it!! We walked in right as they were opening for lunch this Sunday afternoon. As first timers, we spent a few minutes off to the side looking over the menu before we ordered at the front. A really helpful staff member told us their specialities and gave us suggestions for first timers to try. I ordered the 1/4 chicken and substituted my 2 sides for the recommended quinoa stuffed avocado. The chicken was juicy and tender, not dried out! It came with mild and medium sauces. LOVED them both!!! My husband had the Inca Wrap with chicken and french fries as a side. Wrap was tasty, but not as good as my roast chicken. The fries (which were recommended by the staff member) were like he said, probably the best in town! They were crunchy, not greasy at all! The food was presented beautifully and was served quickly! They also have nice patio area off the the side, would be perfect come spring! 
I'll definitely be back! All of the staff were efficient and gave great customer service!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and it never disappoints. Their chicken is so juicy and flavorful, favorite sides are cilantro rice, beans, and sweet potato fries. And to top it off, their aji Amarillo sauce pairs well with the chicken. Service is always great and space is always clean!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at this location recently.  We enjoyed the food very much.  I had the quarter chicken with green beans and sweet potato fries.  The chicken is very moist. I am very picky about green beans, but I loved these and I think the sweet potato fries are my favorite part of the meal.  My husband had a beef and rice dish.  The presentation of the dish was remarkable.  He said it's almost to pretty to eat. But, he did eat it, and he enjoyed every bite of it.  The servers were excellent and the whole staff was pleasant and observant of all the customers.  Everyone should try this place.  You'll go back!"}
{"text":"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Dear Franchise Lords - let this take off and be in every city everywhere. 

So much freaking amazingness in one place. Everyone seems to think so too because it was PACKED. 

Think... Chipotle-ish, but like a million times better obviously. 

Order your food at the counter, take a number and sit down and your food is brought to you - FAST. 

The service is kind of ridiculously amazing for a sort of fast food joint - they walk around and check on you, get you refills, have smiles on their faces, work fast, and are all around just pleasant. 

We ate dessert before lunch because... I just wanted to do that...now let's talk about the TRES LECHES cake that will change your life. Just take a bite into heaven and soak it all in. I can't even describe it - it is just that delicious. Forget whatever diet you're on and ORDER THIS. 

Get the dark meat chicken - so moist... so flavorful... and drench it in the yellow sauce they give you. You will not be disappointed. The green one had too strong of a cilantro flavor for me. 

Other winners were the green beans and sweet potato fries and don't neglect the HERBAL LEMONADE (mint, basil, and rosemary deliciousness) Sounds weird... tastes amazing. 

I just cannot say enough good things about this place. I want it every day."}
{"text":"I am a women of tradition and tend to get the same thing every time but honestly, that is ok because the chicken is great. I always  order a quarter chicken and then the plantains, after that, its always a toss-up between the yucca and the rice for my second side. I highly recommend trying the yellow and green sauces they offer. I am not completely positive what is in them, just the fact that they really elevate the chicken and rice. 

Also, it may sound strange, but their herbal lemonade! If you haven't tried it yet, I definitely suggest it. There is something about it. I have never had it before and I have yet to find it anywhere else. Its a staple on my Viva Chicken list. 

The only issue with this location is space. If you come during lunch in the busy hour, seating can be difficult. The seating area is not large and while they do have some outside seating, that is also limited. Parking can be a little tricky too with the lunch hour but I have yet to not find a spot in the lot across the street."}
{"text":"Wish I could get it more often.  My stomach is growling just thinking about their sauces, chicken and rice."}
{"text":"After seeing such high ratings and good reviews everywhere, I was definitely left disappointed after my visit. Maybe I had too high of expectations, but nothing seemed special at all in my recent visit.

I ordered a quarter chicken with fried yuca and sweet plantains as my two sides. The rotisserie chicken was very juicy and you could tell it hadn't been sitting around in a warmer or anything, but it didn't have a lot of flavor overall. The sauces were great, however. The aji amarillo (yellow) sauce was excellent, very salty but with flavors I couldn't quite put my finger on. The huacatay sauce (green) had a strong cilantro and mint flavor and a decent bit of kick; it was slightly similar to salsa verde and I really enjoyed it as well. The fried yuca was almost like a slightly larger potato fry, and they were fried perfectly. There was almost no seasoning or salt on them though, so they definitely had to be dipped in one of the sauces (but the sauces are awesome so I probably would have anyway). The fried plantains were a huge letdown for me. They looked awesome but they were undercooked and were still very tough and chewy. They were also a bit sweeter than I expected. 
Overall the chicken and yuca were decent but really needed the sauces to be good, and I did not care for the plantains at all. I was also a bit disappointed in the portions. I received 4 yuca fries and 4 pieces of plantains, not to mention 1/4 chicken isn't really that much meat. I was also really let down by the time it took to get my food- exactly 20 minutes. I understand that it was in the peak of the lunch rush, but the gentleman at the table next to me complained to the manager because his food had taken almost 25 minutes."}
{"text":"I have tried several dishes here, and they have all been great!  The tacu bowls are delicious, and I love the green sauce that accompanies them.  The plantains are also very good!"}
{"text":"I go here every other Thursday. The chicken is so juicy and tender. The different types of sauces for the meats are very good! The quinoa stuffed avocado is crazy good!"}
{"text":"We placed a large catering order for a group lunch and it was wonderful! They delivered the food (and it was A LOT of food!) and help set everything up. Kate was extremely helpful throughout the process. They are great!"}
{"text":"I come here for the Inca Wrap. I can tell they make it with fresh avocado, cilantro infused rice & other ingredients. Also, the plantains are really good. I just wish they had more plant-based items to choose from. My boyfriend is a vegetarian and there's another wrap on the menu that he can eat. I'd give this place 4 stars if they served more of a plant-based variety!"}
{"text":"Viva chicken is great! Love their food, employees are super helpful and friendly! And they keep the restaurant clean, even in busy times!"}
{"text":"First time there yesterday with the family... my wife and I liked it so much we stopped by today for lunch!  Great healthy, fast food concept!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken, I can't quit you.

The quinoa stuffed avocado is still my obsession. I love that there is a half order option. Make sure to add chicken to it. Add to that obsession list- the fried rice. During my most recent visit, one of the workers brought me a sauce from the kitchen. Game changer. It's like a hoisin type and is absolutely delicious. Sadly, it was just a seasonal sauce they had for a salad. I'm a big fan of all the sauces here. They're all so different and tasty. The chicken is amazing. I don't think there's a wrong way to order here. The herbal limeade and passion fruit juices are made in house. Note: there's no free refills on those specialty drinks. So, show some restraint and don't chug your drink. 

This place gets pretty busy, so I typically get my food to go. You can order online for pick up now. All the workers here are really nice. It's one of those places where you can't help but leave happy."}
{"text":"The BEST Peruvian food in Charlotte! Definitely go you won't be disappointed. Their chicken is great and the yellow and green dipping sauces are so good."}
{"text":"I was driving by and remember they now have a Park Road location and I totally turned my car around to go back!!! Tried to place an online order while driving but this location doesn't show up yet. I was able to place a phone order. The person taking the order was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions. 
Getting to the location may seem hard but if you continue down Abby Place and cut through the parking lot you are able to get to the parking easily. The outside of the building is very nice and they have two entrances and a patio for sitting. Since they just opened they had greeters at both doors handing out menus and give you directions to the counter. Everyone was very friendly. 
I stood in line for about a minute and then was able to speak to someone at a register. I was amazed that my order was ready when I arrived cause it literally took me only 4/5 minute to get there. They work fast. I was also directed to the condiment station. I was able to grab some more of the yummy yellow sauce for my Arroz Chaufa 
Upon opening the Togo container the wonderful aroma of ginger hits you! The Arroz Chaufa was delicious and the yellow sauce gives it a little spice. 
I'm soooo happy they have a Park Road location. Since it is so close to home and work I know I will be a regular to this location!!!"}
{"text":"I was initially reluctant to go to Viva Chicken as a vegetarian, but man was I blown away by the awesome food and diet-friendly options!

I recommend going early to beat the lunch rush, like my boyfriend and I did (arrived around 11:30am). After much deliberation over the myriad of choices, I settled on the limena salad (w/lime vinaigrette instead of ranch) and my boyfriend got the Inca wrap w/chicken. Also, shoutout to the awesome herbal limeade.

The service was extremely fast and the food was fresh, delicious, and affordable. My salad had perfectly crispy chickpeas, edamame, queso blanco...what more could you ask for! My boyfriend ordered the side of quinoa which was really creamy and I highly recommend ordering.

I can't wait to go back and try more of their food. The name is quite deceiving - it's so much more than chicken!"}
{"text":"I wish that this restaurant could be given 10 stars. I just got back from Miami last week and I tried the same dish in an \"authentic Peruvian restaurant\" down there and I can honestly say there's no comparison. This place is way better. I travel with work quite a bit and every time we are in Charlotte we order from there or go eat there."}
{"text":"Super friendly and helpful staff! Food was simple ingredients with LOTS of flavor.  A little spicy for me but my man was in love with it! We both got 1/4 chicken.  Great ambience! Try their homemade juices! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this meal very much. The sauces were delicious, and definitely the high light of the meal. Portion size was huge, so be sure and come hungry. Service was good for how busy they were, and the food is brought out very fast. The chicken was seasoned to perfection!"}
{"text":"Whoa!  I found this restaurant by chance through a Google recommendation.  I decided to give it a chance today for lunch with a co-worker. I had the 1/2 chicken all white meat, infused rice, salad  and it was absolutely tasty!!!  Check it out if you are in the area, great service, atmosphere and background music. The fruit drinks are spot on too. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This Peruvian inspired restaurant is AMAZING! I would go as far as saying that it's Charlotte trolley's best stop. It is tucked away in Elizabeth, between CPCC and the hospital. A gem that everyone seems to be raving about!

This place is my guilty pleasure, as I can always find something on the menu that I enjoy. It's main focus is a Peruvian style rotisserie chicken. Who doesn't love chicken!? Some of my favorites are \"The Great wrap\" and the \"Quinoa Stuffed Avocado\". In my opinion, these are probably the most popular meals here. As for sides, I always get the Yuca fries. They're so addicting and pair well with all three of the homemade sauces. Also, Their prices are very reasonable. I never spend over $10 dollars, and leave full every time. 

The food is prepared very fast, and the customer service is great. I alway get a good vibe from the workers, as they seem to enjoy serving the customers. I really like how they have it set up to place orders. It is very similar to Zoe's Kitchen where you place your order and they take the food to you when it's ready. Although you don't have a \"server\", there is always staff going around to check to see if you need anything. I recommend Viva Chicken to anyone looking for outstanding service and delightful food!"}
{"text":"Originally, my friend and i were going to go to Mily & Lalo but because it was so packed and getting late we didn't want to wait. I yelp another restaurant and came across this one and I'm so glad i did. 

This place wasn't busy and I'm surprised it wasn't. The chicken was so good. Super juicy and the meat fell right off the chicken legs. The white meat was also pretty juicy and not dry at all. We ordered the combo of $25 that came with the chicken, salad with avocado, sweet plantains, rice. OH, and their green sauce was delish! That is a super great deal i have to say. We didn't finish and packed the rest of the chicken home. While I was there I enjoyed a cheerwine that I Typically don't have access to living in Virginia Beach and while I was eating and the drink was almost empty a thoughtful employee by the name of Vadim came over and asked if I would allow him to refill my drink (WOW did that just happen?) and after I finished and was engaging my friend in some casual conversation another wonderful employee by the name of Yisenia had come over and requested permission to take away my plate that was obviously finished. I cant remember the last time I was in a fast food establishment that treated their customers so good! Next day, reheated the chicken in the oven and it still tasted so good. We ordered the corn and cheese for appetizer, which was something we weren't use to, and i didn't like so much.

Service was great, food was great, and loved the decor! I will come back for more!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place-- even as a chain! The food is to die for and I don't eat meat  ! The quinoa stuffed avocado and side of green beans are my go-to! Very healthy! 

Also, there staff is amazing. So friendly at the counter. One guy is constantly cleaning, another is walking around filling up water, another is picking up your trash, and the girl who brought my order over (I was getting water) waited until I got back to read off the order and ensure she delivered it right!

The best!!! All of them need raises because they work hard!"}
{"text":"I liked the place, but it wasn't totally mind blowing.  I had 1/2 a chicken with yuca (cassava) and plantains.  The herbal lemonade was different, but in retrospect I wish I'd just rocked a sweet tea."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian style chicken in Charlotte hands down. The flavor of the rotisserie chicken is fantastic and it's always cooked to perfection. Very moist. The menu is more dynamic than other similar restaurants with sandwich options, Asian type rice bowls and of course their signature rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Viva Chicken so I was anxious to try it out. I went for lunch today and I was BLOWN AWAY!!!..:and though the food is good, that wasn't the (main) reason I was.  The reason is because this wonderful young lady named Flavia was so helpful!  She did her job, and WAY above and beyond it!! I can not recall ever having service like that at any restaurant. When I arrived, I was not sure of what I wanted and informed her that this was my 1st time here. She asked me what I was in the mood for and explained many of their offerings. You could tell she didn't just work there, but also enjoyed the food she spoke so highly of. 

Flavia took my order and then brought me over to sample some of their signature juices (I purchased the Herbal Limeade). I ordered the 1/2 chicken meal  since she said I would want to take some home. My sides were the plantains and chicken soup. I also ordered the veggie Arroz Chaufa rice and the Tres Leches cake for dessert.  

Flavia's assistance didn't stop there. Once I sat down, she brought me out some sauces to take home with my to go order, and grabbed me some to enjoy with my meal. She also brought me some cutlery and napkins, and checked on me throughout my meal to make sure I was good!  The food was very good...very flavorful and I loved all 3 of the sauces. They complimented the meal very well.   Flavia also brought me out a yuca fry to try, which was good. 

I was full and so glad I stopped in today for lunch here. I'd visited another Peruvian restaurant and their service/attitude was nowhere near as top notch as what I experienced here. Also, and for me this is big, they are not willing to share their sauces. For your meal you *might* get 2 small cups that are half full, but any more WILL cost you!! I so appreciate having the option to enjoy all of the sauce I care for at Viva. Thank you - you have no idea what you've done by providing that option, but my guess is if others have tried that other restaurant and then come here like I did, they will stick with Viva!

I will definitely be back...again, of course for the food, but ESPECIALLY because of Flavia. You are a true gem, and I really thank you for making my first experience a really enjoyable one."}
{"text":"Great place on Elizabeth that I want to come to lunch for soon! It's a vibrant Peruvian Place and can't wait to come back. I understand all the hype!"}
{"text":"I was encouraged by these folks to give them another try. I decided to come back. I tried the steak and it was good. The salads have a nice presentation. My friends and family all enjoy Viva"}
{"text":"I love, love, love Viva. Everything I've tried has been amazing. I go back just for the sauces! Their balsamic dressing is some of the best I've ever had. The mango juice is very good, also."}
{"text":"Best sauce, chicken, soup, rice I've had in a very long time. Even their weird juice is good...the herbal lemonade?? I think it was called. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken has 
fresh wonderful meals. Everything is healthy, delicious, free range and the staff is great. The GM Sergio personally shook my fiancé and my hand tonight and thanked us for joining them. 

This place is on point for lunch or dinner. A new staple!!"}
{"text":"Quinoa. Stuffed. Avocados. The only thing you need to remember when placing your order!  I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"Viva chicken never fails to disappoint! I love the quinoa stuffed avocado with pulled chicken for lunch.  It's so filling I usually just get the half order AND it's so affordable! I also love the plantains and the green sauce is so addictive. Perfect for quick and healthy meals that taste great."}
{"text":"Love this little place. Fresh food, healthy options. The dining area is on the small side, but it's very casual. so whether you're in work attire or just getting out of the gym you'll feel comfortable having lunch or dinner there. I usually pick my meals up to go. The chicken is tender and I crave the fried plantains :)"}
{"text":"The Great wrap and the stuffed avocado are my favorites. Try all the sauces. They are spicy but not so spicy your mouth hurts."}
{"text":"It's a good product, but online ordering system is really buggy. The product had promise, but they are overreaching with an online system that isn't stable"}
{"text":"I was very excited to visited Viva Chicken from hearing all the reviews and how packed it always is when I drive by. Unfortunately, it wasn't what I expected at all! I decided to visit after lunch because of how packed it usually is but I guess the staff mentally zones out after lunch too. When I walked in I was puzzled to where to order and even what to get. With no assistance I looked for a menus and began to search for something to order.

The girl behind the cash register wasn't really any help on what to order when I asked, so I ended ordering the 1/4 Chicken, Cilantro rice and fries. Let's just say it was very bland with no type of flavor at all. I was very disappointed being that the customer service atmosphere was sub-par. I was really hoping that the food was going to be great. 

I did order a drink as well and they didn't even have the sweet tea filled up. As I left I notice an older gentleman greeting people and asking them do they \"need assistance on the menu.\" I thought to myself \"where was this service when I walked in!\" I guess I caught them on a bad day for first impressions."}
{"text":"Big fan of Viva Chicken!  Never had anything I did not like there and the sauces are amazing.  I like all three but if you like some heat with your meal, go for the red/orange sauce, so good!  But the other two will not disappoint. 

My favorite thing to order is the stuffed avocado with chicken.  Filling and delicious!  But of course you cannot go wrong with an order of 1/4 chicken and any of the sides.  Personally, I love the plantains and sweet potato fries.  

And while you're at it, try one of the Peruvian drinks!  They are different and pretty authentic to some I've tried in Peru."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere! Super affordable! Quick service with beer & wine!!! We had the chicken with yucca and plantains. Everything tasted great. We shared papas huacaina. (Grilled potatoes over salad with an amazing sauce) a must try!!! Passion fruit mousse for dessert - loved it! I can't wait to tell all of friends about this place."}
{"text":"I've eaten at both of their Charlotte/LKN locations and the food is delicious. I get the Naked Peruvian wrap (it's vegetarian) and it's awesome. Their sauces are amazing too, I dream about this food, seriously. I go with plenty of meat eaters and they all seem to love what they get as well. Lots of people have said the quinoa stuffed avocado is good too."}
{"text":"I ordered the rotisserie chicken it was tasty with sweet potato fries and infused rice. I also ordered the herbal lemonade it hit the spot. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"After Brenda from Viva Chicken reached out to me about our recent visit I am raising my review to 3 stars until we eat there again. When a manager or owner reaches out it shows how much they care about their business. Like my first review said the staff were so friendly and nice. Plus they were all either working or cleaning which is a great impression to make on diners. What is everyone's favorite dish here for us to try? 



We finally made it to Viva Chicken today for take out after work. The staff and cleanliness were over the top. You will not find nicer employees who were happy & friendly. Having a 99.5 grade from the health department is very impressive. The food however left us wondering what the big fuss is all about. The french fries were crispy and tasty. The chicken however was so dry and tasteless I would have returned it had I not already been home. There was no flavor even in the skin. Not sure if this was supposed to come with a sauce or something, or if sauce would have even helped. The green beans were limp and very dry, like they were leftover from lunch or day before. The Churro was the main reason I would ever return. When Chicken is part of the Brand name it should be the main go to reason to visit this place. Again the help were so nice and everyone was cleaning while I waited that those 2 things get the stars not the food."}
{"text":"This chicken wad so good, moist and flavorful!  I love the infused rice with it hint of cilantro!  The green beans were fresh and crisp.  I usually am not one to get a dessert in a restaurant but this one is comprable to anything you will get at Amelie's. The caramel is on real!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch twice in one week and loved the food both times! I had the 1/4 chicken with 2 sides and the quinoa stuffed avocado. When I was ordering I thought 1/4 chicken was actually 1/4 of a chicken but when my food came it was only a thigh... which means next time I'll be getting half! Or maybe split a whole chicken if I came in a larger group. I also got the herbal lemonade which is VERY basil-y and rosemary-y so I drank some and then diluted it with some water and it was still pretty strong. I'd still recommend getting it because the flavor was so unique. Probably my favorite part of the meal was the sauces though. The Aji Amarillo is so good I would eat it by the spoonful if that were socially acceptable. None of the supposedly spicy sauces were very spicy however which was kinda surprising.
For dessert, I tried the churro and the tres leches cake. The churro had filling which made it a little too sweet for my taste but it came piping hot which was nice. I like that the cake comes in a container because I took it home and devoured it when I wasn't so stuffed. SO GOOD!!! I loved the whipped frosting because there were granules of sugar mixed in that gave it a slight crunch.
When I came on a Thursday around noon the place was PACKED and I had to wait maybe 5 minutes before I got a seat but I guess that's what happens when a restaurant serves addictive food. Also, maybe because the restaurant was so crowded but it was really loud inside which is my only real complaint."}
{"text":"I love it.  Anyone from Florida who knows about Pollo Tropical. ..this is the closest that you will get in NC.  Same concept with a swankier look and different sauces to dip your chicken in.  I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they are part of the same parent franchise.  If there were more of these Boston Market would go out of business.  Everything I've had has been yummy.  The staff at both the uptown and huntersville locations are peppy and happy, and they have yet to get my orders wrong."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot the first time I visited. That's why I was really eager to stop in again this morning. However, I was really irked to get there 30 minutes past opening time and find the door locked and shades drawn. Sign on the door about being closed. 

May be back, but with so many other options close by, who knows."}
{"text":"I've been to Viva Chicken twice and it was equally good each time.  Both times I have gotten the 1/4 chicken or 1/2 chicken with two sides.   I recommend the dark meat as its the most tasty but the white meat is good as well.

I don't think the meat by itself is 5-star quality, but the two sauces that come with it put the meat over the top.  The yellow sauce (mild) is my Fav, but the green (medium) is very good as well.

Where Viva Chicken really shines are the side items.  To date, I've had the green beans, sweet potato fries, and plantains.  All 3 of these items are excellent.  The sweet potato fries are fairly similar to what you get at other places, but great quality overall.

The green beans are very unique with an interesting/spicy flavor combination and they appear to be skillet cooked by their texture.  Overall best side item IMO.  The plantains are great.  I'm not an expert on plantains by any means, but I love the ones here.

The herbal lemonade is amazing (if you like lemonade) so I really recommend that as well.  Overall this is a a great lunch place and a good chill dinner place.  Overall very casual atmosphere, really love the porch."}
{"text":"This place is getting busier as busier and it's no surprise.  The food here is incredible. I always got the rotisserie chicken with platano and cilantro rice however I heard about 'the great' sandwich and had to try it.  Best decision I've made at this place. The great takes some rotisserie chicken, puts it on a ciabatta bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, and an optional avacado. After adding the yellow sauce that comes with it I finish the sandwich every time. Service is good, food is great, and the space (especially the patio) is comfortable."}
{"text":"Went here had a breast wing with canary beans...delicious, and the cilantro rice also pretty good.  The chicken was very good,  it was just a touch too salty in my opinion but still delicious.  I definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"As the current Duchess of this Viva Chicken location (& I don't even eat chicken) I guess it's my duty to finally write a review!

I've been in here quite a bit since last April, around the time I started going to the Greenway nearby regularly. I usually start at the Piper Glen side & turn around once I get to the Johnston Rd bridge, but one time I decided to keep going ahead. After a certain point, there was a fork in the trail & I had to pick left or right? I picked left & about 5 minutes later, I knew I had made the right choice.. Because I was starving & once I went up a hill, I saw the back entrance of Viva Chicken!

Anyway enough about that.. You just want to hear about the food right? My go to for awhile was the Andina Power Food. It has everything I like in it! Kale & romaine based with avocado, edamame, red bell peppers, \"seasonal fruit\" (which is always oranges apparently), and sliced almonds. The only thing I could do without is the quinoa.. For some reason I'm not a fan & I think it's because of the heavy cilantro flavor. I prefer the balsamic dressing (the one on Quinoa Stuffed Avocados) over the passionfruit vinaigrette it normally comes with.

Another item I've been getting a lot lately is the Inca Wrap with Plantains. The wrap is so good & filling, with cilantro infused rice (I know I've been hating on cilantro but I feel like the flavor is more subtle in the rice), salsa criolla, avocado, & canary beans. After a few bites of the wrap, I take a bite of plantain so I can have a bit of that sweet & savory action going & I like to save one plantain as a \"dessert.\"

Their juices are also tasty & sometimes I get all 3 because why not. The Maracuya (passionfruit) is delicious, but compared to the other 2, it's a bit boring. The Chicha Morada has some kind of spices in it that makes it a unique drink, but the Herbal Limeade is my favorite! It's refreshing & has hints of basil & rosemary in it, which sounds weird but it's a real treat. 

Sauces are all good as well. My favorite is the Aji Amarillo (yellow) sauce. Idk what's in it & it's the mildest one but it's so tasty! The Gringo Killer (peach colored) sauce is my 2nd fav & honestly I don't think it's that spicy. Huacatay (green) sauce is my least favorite because of the strong cilantro presence but I do enjoy it in small amounts. 

Food comes out relatively quick & service is on point. It's a great rest stop for me before I head back to the Greenway & walk an hour to my car. Thanks Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"Round up your llamas! This Peruvian place is legit! 
I know my Peruvian food. I've spent time eating \"Cuey\" in Cusco. Cuey is the national food of Peru, guinea pig. Unfortunately, this restaurant doesn't serve Cuey. But they do have some amazing Peruvian food. 
The quinoa stuffed avocados were amazing. They put some chicken in with the quinoa, and the avocado was grilled to perfection. It was delightful. 
We split a half-chicken, the stuffed avocado along with some yucca fries and fried plantains. The food was marvelous. Seriously delicious. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The avocado was stuffed with quinoa and chicken, and roasted. 
The best part of this place is the sauces. They have a variety of authentic Peruvian sauces of varying tastes and levels of heat. None of them are incredibly hot. 
The service was great, and the decor was interesting. 
I saw that they even sell Inca Cola, the Peruvian version of Mountain Dew. It's awesome."}
{"text":"I've been to one other Viva Chicken location before, and was already impressed with that.. Today for lunch I went to the Park Rd location (its second day open, I believe) and got a wrap and a side of plantains.

It tasted amazing, especially the plantains with green dipping sauce.

Even though it was only the second day, and it was PACKED, the staff knew what they were doing and were extremely nice.. if they can keep this level of quality up there as the months go on, they'll have a customer for life."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Viva Chicken for lunch with a coworker since we were in the area.  Took multiple trips around the parking lot to find a parking space, when we arrived at 12:45.  Finally Got inside of the restaurant, even though the line to order food was to the door, it moved FAST! Ordering was seamless.  

Now finding a table - #savage style!! Good luck when they're busy.  I would hope that they find a better way for seating when all tables are occupied.  A guy literally ignored that I was waiting for the table to be cleaned and proceeded to call his friends over.   Luckily, another table came available a couple of minutes later. 

Although busy, our food came out SO fast and it was hot!  I ordered the Chaufa Rice and added the chicken.  Chaufa rice is Peruvian style fried rice.  Very flavorful, portions were plentiful!  My only semi complaint is that it had too many scallions on top and throughout the rice portion (which I picked off).  I ate until I was full and took more than 3/4 of my serving home for dinner.  Crazy to say - it was even better for dinner!! 

Guys - the staff!! Insert heart emoji.  They are super friendly, very caring and attentive.  Tables were cleaned off fast. 

Great food, food prices were fair ($6-$10 options) and our dining party was very satisfied with their food.  I feel like their menu has something for everyone from salads, rotisserie chicken, yuca fries, fries, rice infused with cilantro, all of which I've had on previous VC visits and loved! I'm always very satisfied when I visit any Viva Chicken Location.  

Lost a star due to parking & table/seating situation."}
{"text":"Viva chicken has a reputation of having amazing food, so when it came to close to where I lived I got extremely excited. The Viva chicken lives up to the hype. 
Viva Chicken gets five stars from me, because of the quality of food and the value. 
While I am no expert in Peruvian cuisine, I continually come back to this place for the delicious rotisserie chicken and unique menu items like the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado."}
{"text":"Had the tacu bowl and it was very good. The portion size was enough to fill up on and take a little bit home for later. I would definitely return again"}
{"text":"For a place called \"Viva Chicken,\" they have a really great veggie wrap. I ordered the Naked Peruvian through DoorDash and was surprised by the freshness of the ingredient and the flavor. Also, the cilantro infused rice had a nice texture and was far from bland. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent but it is almost always crowded. They have opened up their outside a bit to provide more seating. I haven't had anything there that was bad. My wife and I come back as often as possible but try to get in early before the rush. They have opened up more restaurants around the city so be sure to check one of them out!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing!...I've been here a few times and they never slack on the flavor. The service is prompt and servers are always very nice. I'm  glad it's finally warm enough to enjoy the patio space. 10s  across the board!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this restaurant! I always order the same thing, quinoa avocado w/ chicken, half chicken white with double side of yucca (delicious!) and herbal lemonade. YOU MUST GET THE LEMONADE! We live so far away in Huntsville, AL, but this is the number one place to eat when we land in the city. I usually order online. Food is always cooked to perfection. Service is great and there isn't a long wait. Oh how I wish they were local!!"}
{"text":"The food was so good that I  forgot to take pictures  (which is rare ).  We came here twice during our trip to Charlotte.   The first time was for dinner but rain was so heavy that we could not get out if the car.  It was so heavy that the restaurant was flooded.   We had to order to go.  The second time we came for lunch on Saturday before our drive back to New York. 

Whole chicken with 3 sides are $22 which is  very reasonable.   Chicken was tender,  piping hot and delicious - 5 stars

{"text":"Had their ARROZ CHAUFA with no meat and it was surprisingly delicious! I wasn't expecting the rice to be so tasty. I'll definitely look out for this place again."}
{"text":"It doesn't take much to please me...but these guys go above and beyond in their service. Not only is their food delicious but their staff is incredibly helpful and peppy at all times. For service like this I will continue to come back and work my way through their menu."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. It's the place I seek out when I'm about to cheat on my diet because I am in serious need of comfort food. It tastes like its bad for you.... But it's not!!!! Yay! 

I get the chicken stuffed quinoa avocado. I also get the chicken stir fry plate that comes with rice, avocado and other goodness called \"arroz chuafa\" with chicken.

The Green Sauce is crack. Put that stuff on everything!!!!"}
{"text":"Unlike its Ballantyne location this Location feels very rushed. It's very small, and all the tables are wayyyyy too close together. 
In fact a viva employee say right next to me, too close to me... I had to move my purse she was so close...Considering there were other places to sit, this wasn't appreciated. Her coworker came up and started eating off her plate while he was working, then continued to run food to tables... This is also pretty gross.
If I come back, I'll order to go. I don't care for the setting."}
{"text":"Fantastic rotisserie chicken and plantains. The yellow and green sauce are great compliments to dip the chicken or mix your rice into.  The chicken is perfectly seasoned and not too mention they give you a large portion for a fair price."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that quinoa stuffed avocados are what foodie dreams are made of!!! This place is amazing. You can order online and they're very happy to meet customizations (light mayo, things on side, etc). Always friendly when I go in with a minimal line and easy/breezy check out.... I am almost ashamed to admit I've not even eaten the chicken - I tried the stuffed avocados and haven't strayed. Perfectly seasoned/salted and the avocados are blemish free. My husband loves the \"great\" chicken sandwich and I've heard so many gush over the green sauce. I'm very happy viva chicken is here and being able to order from the treadmill (at nearby gym) doesn't hurt on the weekends. Ballantyne loves you Viva Chicken! Stay here for good please!!!!"}
{"text":"Love love viva chicken, rotisserie with awesome sauces! They used to be pretty stingy with the sauces you got but now have started setting the out. Great amount of food but I feel like the sides are a bit too healthy for me and lack a little flavor."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The QUINOA STUFFED AVOCADO is my absolute favorite. Definitely add chicken if you're a meat-eater. It comes on a bed of lettuce, so it's essentially a small salad with a whole avocado and quinoa and it's incredible. Another great option is the Naked Peruvian Wrap w/chicken and get the Balsamic Vinaigrette to dip it in and it's essentially the stuffed avocado in a wrap form and it's slightly more filling, although both are very delicious and filled with the same things - you just get a tortilla wrap and a side with the wrap so that's why it's a bit more filling. But my go to is the avocado dish. It's truly incredible. Their herbal lemonade is so yummy too! You won't regret dining here. Take out or dine in :)"}
{"text":"I loved this place soooo much! Wish we discovered it sooner! I got the Naked Purivian on the sun-tried tomato wrap - amazing. Truly so good. Added chicken. Dip it in the yellow sauce they have there (forgot the name) adds even more yummy flavor. Paired it with the house salad that has a very tasty dressing. Only giving 4 star cause my Husband got the Wow sandwich and the ciabatta roll was a bit dry. Other than that it was all great :) oh, and if your thirsty, grab the herbal lemonade too. So very tasty and refreshing."}
{"text":"Decor is certainly better than any Peruvian Chicken spot I have ever been too. However, the chicken was just ok spice wise. It was served hot and fresh it just did not have the  kick I'm used too when eating Peruvian Chicken. But all in all I would come back when visiting the area"}
{"text":"Well...I loved it until I got the avocados stuffed with chicken. The moment I left the restaurant my stomach started hurting. I went home and was sick all night. I definitely had food poisoning. It was unfortunate because their food isn't cheap! I haven't been able to eat avocados since."}
{"text":"The Stuffed Avocado with chicken is surprisingly amazing!  The Arroz Chaufa with chicken is also Very Very Good.  The dishes are made with spices that make a basic dish full of flavor.  The garlic green sauce is also great with the rice and chicken.  Ill post pics next time, yep the food has magically disappeared."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Chicken is seasoned to perfection, yuca is very good, rice is yummy, and sauces are to die for. I don't have a bad thing to say about this place!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Would love it if they would make more vegetarian options. For instance, their soup looks amazing but you cannot asked for it without their signature chicken."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying out Viva Chicken. My cashiers name was Chad and definitely knew what he was talking about when it came to the menu and specialty drinks and even helped me pronounce the things on the menu lol he was very informative and seemed to love his job as well as the other employees! Definitely will have to come back soon! Loved my food!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! I got the Peruvian Fried Rice with steak and to be honest it was a littttlee bit salty at first but I didn't notice it as I kept eating. My sister got the same thing except with chicken and that one was pretty good too! Her boyfriend got the roasted chicken with fries and oh my goodness the fries were SO GOOD. Overall I would give the food a 4 but the reason I am giving this place a 5 is because of the service. The manager was very attentive and came asked how everything was. The place was very well staffed and everyone was very nice. I don't live near the area and stopped by just to get lunch during our road trip but it made the trip worthwhile :)"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. The entire staff is friendly. Online ordering ahead is available and easy. Very cool atmosphere. And extremely reasonably priced. Again, I can't stress how delicious the food and especially the sauces are. I try to make it at least once a week and always go for the Tacu Bowl. It's so good I haven't been tempted to try anything else."}
{"text":"Chicken was marvelous, juicy, tender, and with a lot of flavor! Great job! The sangaria was fine too.  But the chicha something taste is special. Not my thing."}
{"text":"I just moved into town this week, and have no idea where to go. I was looking of local food joints, and i went here based on the Yelp reviews.....thank god! The food was amazing. 

So good! like others have said, you MUST try it out."}
{"text":"Great place to eat,  nice vibes . Try the tacu,  and don't be afraid of the Gringo Killer Sauce,  it's not that bad."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  This was our first visit to Viva Chicken, but most definitely not our last.  When I compare this to Pio Pio, though (which we've eaten at half a dozen times), I think Pio Pio's quality slightly edges out Viva.  But, they are a sit-down restaurant and also more expensive, so they are in sort of a different category, although the food is similar.  

We started with the quinoa stuffed avocado, which everyone has raved about on Yelp.  I know I'm in the minority by saying I wasn't a fan of this dish...it tasted too mayonnaise-y to me.  I would have preferred a simpler quinoa with just a little of the sauce on top, rather than sauce mixed throughout the quinoa.

For my entree, I had the quarter chicken (white), with cilantro-infused rice and sweet plantains.  The chicken was tasty, but a smaller portion than I usually get at Pio, and slightly less tender.  The green sauce was my favorite of the two that came with the dish, but it wasn't as flavorful (or hot) as the sauces served at Pio.  I loved the cilantro in the rice, but could have done without the peas and carrots.  The plantains were very good, and some of the best I've had.  My biggest complaint was that it was a little hard to eat the chicken with cheap, plastic utensils.  Viva would be better served to at least upgrade the utensils so it's easier to pull the chicken off the bone.  

My hubby had \"The Great\" sandwich, with avocado, cheese, and bacon.  Her really loved this sandwich, as well as the beans he ordered as a side.

I usually don't get sodas at restaurants, but they had an interesting herb-infused lemonade that I had to try.  I'm not sure how much it cost me, but it was really tasty, and I'd order it again.

Viva's patio is really nice.  It's covered and surrounded by planters, so it's well-shaded.  But there are only about ten tables out there, so you have to get there early to snag a seat!  The mood music they play is also a welcome change from the pop crap that most other businesses play!

Another thing I really liked about Viva was the service.  Even though you order at the counter, the staff are very friendly and check on you while eating to make sure you are happy with everything.  We didn't see a tip jar out front, and so we left a small tip on the table as a thank you.

I've seen a few complaints about parking, but I've always been able to park in the lot across from Viva (it's free) without any issue.  There's also a large gravel lot next to the tequila bar on the other end of the restaurant strip which is designated for these businesses.  It's not far to walk from Viva from that location, so it's a good backup lot if the main lot is full.

Overall, we paid $35 for our meal, including a beer for my hubby.  That's a little more than I would have expected to pay at a casual place.  Regardless, we plan to return because the food is good and the outdoor seating is so nice."}
{"text":"This place is really good!  Igot their chicken just to try it out for the first time and it was delicious!  It came with a side of chicken soup and green beans (2sides of choice). Both were so good. The price is way less then iwould be willing to pay for this place."}
{"text":"Super good. Don't care for the goat cheese in the sides but that is a personal preference. The chicken rotisserie is well worth it !!! Try the cilantro rice."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I don't live in Charlotte anymore and I seriously wish they would franchise to Michigan. It's so yummy. Stuffed avocado is seriously my favorite thing. I have to stop in here whenever I'm back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken had been on my radar for awhile, and my mister and I finally made the trek over  after running afternoon errands. The location is a little bit tucked away, so it's kind of behind Midwood Smokehouse if you become a little lost in strip mall madness. 

I certainly agree with the other reviewers that the quinoa stuffed avocados with added chicken is where it is at! I eat avocados pretty frequently, and had never thought to pair them with quinoa. The chicken adds some balanced protein to the meal, so it was very filling. The chicken itself was very good; nice heat and spice to it. I added the green medium sauce, but enjoyed sampling the red and yellow sauces as well. I tried the purple corn juice, but it wasn't really my thing. I wish it was served over ice to help cut how syrupy it is. My mister tried the herbal lemonade, which was more my speed and very refreshing."}
{"text":"Great food, Great experience!  Peruvian chicken was not on my radar during my visit to Charlotte, but this place was great!  In addition to the chicken, I had a yucca fries and a small salad.  The salad, which I anticipated to be lackluster, came with a great dressing and was a hearty portion of romaine.  I also had one of their drinks-chicha morada (it's only ten cents more than a soft drink?!), definitely a good choice.  It wasn't as sweet as I would expect something that color to be, which was a great relief! 

The place was packed with a long line, but things moved quickly and our food came out to our table quickly as well.  We hung out here awhile after finishing our meal chatting and catching up but never felt rushed or that we needed to give up our seat."}
{"text":"If you're even thinking of going here just YES!!! I had the quarter chicken with plantains, white rice and their dipping sauces. The chile dipping sauce is my favorite. 

The chicken is moist, juicy and savory. The outside is cooked to perfection as well. Taking some if the chicken in a sauce and some white rice is the perfect flavor combination. They also have cilantro rice which sounds delicious but I haven't tried it yet. 

The plantains I had were quite possibly the best I've ever had. Soft and sweet on the inside and crusty and sugary on the outside. It's not even fair how good they are. I've heard their fried yucca is amazing too; I believe it after eating their food. Seems like they're on point with everything."}
{"text":"Delicious! Especially the yucca fries! As far as the food 5 stars but I will have to give a 4 star rating because the music was too loud. We arrived around 12 noon, not very crowded. The music was so loud it was difficult to carry on a conversation however, we will visit again."}
{"text":"In short: food was great and cheap. 

I stopped into viva chicken because I was going to a concert at Visualite theatre, which is about a 30 second walk away, so convenience was a huge plus for me. There is nearby parking of the street is full, just drove around the block and you're sure to find one of the lots you can use.

I ordered a quarter chicken with the mild sauce, yucca, and canary beans. I didn't care for the yucca, which I would blame on personal tastes, but from what my friends who lived in South America said about it, it actually wasn't prepared particularly well, so take that for what you will. 

The chicken and canary beans, on the other hand, were amazing. The mild sauce had a wonderful taste to it, but even the chicken with no sauce would've been great. I'm not sure what all was included in the beans, but they were also great."}
{"text":"The five stars are because when a place is good there is nothing else they deserve. However, my last visit to this location I noticed something unusual. I will start by saying that viva Chicken got my full trust three years ago when these two guys got together and made a difference in their first establishment by being true to their people. You could see the energy in their team. They were always moving around taking food to tables, talking to customers, ensuring the place had energy ...... etc.
Last time I was in the ballantyne location I noticed there was a new manager and his energy level was not there. He stood around, walked around dragging his feet, never visited a table, and most importantly- didn't create the energy that I was used to. Luckily, I still noticed a guy wearing a shift lead shirt that was touching all points and a chef in the back of the house pushing his team. I am only writing this because I love this concept and I want you to stay true to what your beliefs were and if there is someone that doesn't carry the same energy that the founders used to carry then they should not be part of this movement."}
{"text":"Pros: AMAZING fried rice with shredded chicken [dont get it with steak...you may be dissapointed].
Yummy food 
Nice staff
Able to order online for pickup

Cons: Very long waits during peak times"}
{"text":"Oh how I love Viva Chicken! My husband and I have it once a week as its a staple on nights we don't cook. I've heard great things about everything on their menu, but the rotisserie chicken is where it's at! Some of our favorite sides are yuca, sweet potato fries, plantains, and green beans. DO NOT leave this place without the sauces. Especially the yellow sauce. We pour it on everything and it's especially tasty. We've brought several out of town guests here and they all love it just as much as we do. We've done sit down orders or call ahead and they are always very fast. If you haven't been here, you must visit!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and healthy food. My chicken dish was very good and I will definitely will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Really awesome Peruvian food.  Incredible flavors, outstanding sauces!!  Best thing on the menu is the Saltado!!  Can't go wrong at any of them!!  Sometimes can be crowded so beware of the lines"}
{"text":"Flavorful chicken! The Yucas are really good! The cashier was so nice giving us sides samples!"}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in to this location on a whim, having never heard of it but seeing good reviews here on Yelp. I am very glad we did. It was very yummy! My son got the kids rotisserie chicken and absolutely loved it. He rarely eats chicken off the bone but he pulled it clean. I had the Arroz Chaufa which was wonderful. The chicken was a little dry but not so much that it took away from the flavor of the dish. The rice was cooked perfectly and the portion size was huge! I was very hungry, and admittedly can put away a lot of food when I want, and I still left with about 1/3 of it to-go. My only complaint really is that the environment is quite loud. If you're looking for a nice quiet spot for a romantic date night, this is not the place for you. Other than that, we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch spot filled with authentic fresh delicious Peruvian favorites. Really good options and their chicken and rice is delish."}
{"text":"I love this establishment don't get me wrong, but I was disappointed in the food I received today. As always, I ordered the quarter chicken with fried yuca and cilantro infused rice. My chicken was so dry (which could be masked by the tasty sauces thankfully) and my rice was so hard so it did not seem fresh to me. 

Besides this, service was on point. I would give it 5 stars. I had people constantly checking up on me, asking if I needed more water, asked about dessert, etc."}
{"text":"WHY IS THIS PLACE SO GOOD!!!??!

I usually don't come to this location since it is so far from me, but I will do anything to get my hands on some Viva Chicken! Every time I come here, I order the same thing. I get the 1/4 chicken (dark meat) with cilantro infused rice and fried yuca. The chicken today was so succulent and tender. Sometimes, they cook it for too long and it ends up being too overcooked but I'm glad today was a good day for them.

The purpose of writing this review is to tell you that if you are coming with others, don't order separately. I made that mistake today and I could've gotten a lot more food! If you order the whole chicken as opposed to just getting 1/4 or 1/2 individually, you end up saving more money and getting more food! They are able to choose not 1, not 2, but 3 sides! Keep this in mind next time you are making a stop at VC!"}
{"text":"I love this place.. wait.. I LOVE THIS PLACE. Fresh food, roasted chicken and a little bit of a posh atmosphere. I keep inviting friends and they love it too. My favorite of course is the 1/2 chicken with cilantro rice and sweet potato fries. I just had the yuka and quinoa-stuff avocados with the mild sauce  the other day and lets just say nothing short of amazing. It packs such a flavorful punch. I appreciate the value. I think the sandwiches are enough for the mightiest of men."}
{"text":"Tremendously tasty food. I've had the chicken with sides, yucca, plantains, salads, as well as just the salads with chicken added. All super fresh, wonderfully flavorful, and you can amp it up with the sauces they offer."}
{"text":"Wow! Incredible food. Fast service and great values. I've been there four times this month. My family loves it too!"}
{"text":"this was a double experiment. As a food business owner I want to see how these new services can help. The best way to find out is how your order is brough to you. It was perfect, I love the food but as a chef that studied trur Peruvian cusine I love at this as fusion and it is amazing . The mashed potato chicken salad is a fusion Aji de Galina and they some other twist on the mountain of the ariquepq areq"}
{"text":"So yummy!  I always get the quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken. Trust me on this one. The blend of flavor a is unique and will fill you up. My friends get the salad which is also great or the fried rice. The latter portion is huge. They also care beer from NoDa. The music is a little loud for lunch but certainly drowns out any other conversations. They also have a patio which is roomy for after work drinks."}
{"text":"Just call me Dez Bryant because this food will make you slap your mama! 

Best fries in the game right now. Like before we get to anything else let's give credit to the fries. And I had to get used to them not having ketchup. They have 3 different original sauces that I had to get used to. All the sauces are very good though.

I love the wraps. You can't go wrong with The Great or the Inca wrap. The secret is to add some chicken or bacon to it. Then you gotta dab it in one of the sauces before each bite. That gives you maximum flavor to bite ratio. I know this because I am a scientist.

Are you watching the NBC hit dram \"This Is Us\" yet? You totally should. I know that it has a reputation for making people cry but it's not a sad show. It's an emotional show. But we can all use a good cry. Don't bottle your emotions up inside. It's not healthy. 

And maybe you'll get to see the awesome acting of Sterling K Brown or Mandy Moore. Is that so bad? What do you have against great acting performances that make you feel something? Is that not the whole point of acting? 

Just take my word for it. Watch \"This Is Us\" and get back to me. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"This location officially opens on Monday May 14.  I had the honor of visiting during their soft opening with my wife.  We ordered out favorite dishes and were blown away by the execution.  This isnt our first Viva Chicken Rodeo after all.

For those of you not as familiar with Viva Chicken allow me to introduce you to the food that will change your life.  First of all this is a Peruvian Rottiserie Joint that only uses the finest ingredients and spices for its food.  Chicken, steak, or vegetarian; they got you covered.  Some of the best salads and sandwiches I have ever had.  In a day when it is hard to find awesome food that is actually healthy, this place hits all the right spots.

Sauces galore at this place for you to dip or pour on your food.  Nobody judges here.  My favorite is the Aji Amarillo for use with the fries and chicken.  

If you have room for dessert I highly recommend the Alfajores or Tres Leche.  

This store gets 5 stars for food, service, friendliness of staff, and atmosphere.  I wish them the best of luck when they open officially and will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I've had the chicken dinner and the wrap. The food was delicious, the sides are amazing. It is my new fav!"}
{"text":"I have been back here a few times recently and have discover the stuffed avocado.  Absolutely amazing!!!  I saw some other reviews about it and had to try it.  The flavors mesh together so well!  A smooth and creamy taste of deliciousness in each bite.  

At lunch time it gets packed, but they move quickly and the wait is never long.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  

Still love the limeade-yum!!! And recently had the yuca!! Love it!  Almost like potatoes.  It is a root vegetable and tasted good plain or with ketchup."}
{"text":"Viva is a good place to have lunch.  The new space at Waverly is very large and spacious.  There are many windows all around to let in a lot of natural light.  It's very clean, fresh, and new.  The staff is extremely  nice and even come around filling up drinks and taking trash.  They obviously don't have to and not a lot of places like this do, but it's a nice added touch.  It makes one feel welcome.  Plus you can also tell they work hard.  

The food is good like always.  I like the stuffed avocado and of course all the sauces-yum!  This particular location has a large shared lot for parking and it's not really hard to get a spot."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm chickennnnn. Amazing Latin fusion chicken. Great sides and fantastic sauce. Uhhh yes please. Anyone who hasn't been to this place stop what you're doing now and goooooo!"}
{"text":"So excited to have one of these close to our house now! We went 2 days ago for dinner and both got the 1/4 chicken with 2 sides...delicious!! And she let me try a sample of the juices which was basically genius because they were AMAZING and I'll will definitely be getting one next time!"}
{"text":"So delicious! The staff is friendly and helpful! You truly feel like a guest and they want you to be happy! Would give 5 stars, But......the music is horrific and maddening. If you are sitting near a speaker you will want to run away screaming after 5 minutes or as soon as you realize it is the same line repeated over and over to some weird not music cacophony!!! Please get some real music!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The chicken and sauces are outstanding. Servics was great! I recommend this place to anyone! Love viva chicken!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worth the 5 stars. Food was amazing. Prices were on point. Portions were perfect. Service was fast and friendly. Anyone in the area should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always crowded which means people like it. Their chicken is super flavorful and delicious. Not to mention their fries are some of the best I've ever had. Would highly recommend this restaurant for a quick stop to get lunch."}
{"text":"I thought the food was fresh and healthy. I ordered take-out and had zero issues with portion size or food quality. I ordered the 1/2 chicken with green beans and plantains and chicken fired rice. Both were excellent, but the star was the chicken. It was seasoned well and cook to perfection. In other words my chicken was juicy- YUMMO!!! It was a quick in and out experience and a friendly staff. The décor was welcoming and hip as well as a nice covered patio. If you haven't tried Viva Chicken you should give them a try- they will not disappointment."}
{"text":"What a find in the city of Charlotte. Both my friend and I got the half chicken with green beans and sweet potato fries (sides suggested by the employee). The chicken was utterly succulent, the sweet potato fries on point (when are sweet potato fries not though?), and the green beans had a distinct taste that was delicious. Although, in retrospect I would have gotten the yucca, this place is a must visit while in Charlotte. The portion sizes are generous especially for what you're paying for ($13 for my entire meal). The place is extremely clean and the food was out in less than 10 minutes. Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Ballantyne's Viva Chicken didn't disappoint me. This was my first time visiting the Ballantyme location after being a regular uptown. I seems a bit more spacious than the location in Elizabeth and better suited for groups. Comparing the two, the only difference I noticed was in the green beans, which have more of a fire grilled taste of the Ballantyne location. There is parking in the front and back if it's crowded. Viva chicken is on my list of the best thing since sliced bread."}
{"text":"Viva chicken lives up to the hype. Ordered a whole chicken +green beans + rice + fruit. Chicken was delicious, infused with herbs and spices. This came with three sauces. The yellow sauce, sprinkled with angel tears, is easily the best and reminds me of an aioli. Green sauce is spicy. Reddish sauce is tame. Green beans were fresh and had diced tomatoes. Rice was on the dry side, but with yellow sauce came to life. Fruit was made mostly with pineapple, apple, and orange. Fruit portion was enough for 2, whereas rice and beans could serve four. I also had their papaya juice. It was so, so. Sweet, but I'll get water next time.

The format is that you walk in, order food and pay at the counter, where you will be given a number and can seat yourself. Food is brought out to you. There were several staff members on hand and a nice guy whose name started with a V and had a beautiful Russian accent was very helpful explaining the menu items in depth and making recommendations. He also came over and asked if we needed a high chair for my baby niece. Thank goodness for helpful people.

Combos $9. Drinks $2.5 Whole chicken + 3 sides $21.

Only recommendation for improvement are bigger plates. I'm also not clear whether tipping is appropriate here. It's more self serve, but the staff was very helpful and kind of assisted when they saw fit. Overall, great value if you have a family."}
{"text":"I've given this restaurant two opportunities to wow me and I just haven't gotten that.  The food is good but nothing \"so good\" that I need to go back to get it again.

What really ruined my experiences was the climate control issues.  The first time I went, we sat inside and there was no A/C.  Mind you it was early July and about 80 degrees inside.  I could barely eat my food I was so uncomfortably hot.

A month later my husband talked me into giving them another shot. On the plus side, the have added wall mounted (close to the ceiling) A/C units.  The down side is that they are set on an oscillating mode, so every 30 seconds you find yourself in the middle of an arctic blast.  Each time, my napkin would go flying off my lap to the floor.

My husband likes their food, so I will probably return to this restaurant for him.  Otherwise, I would never chose on my own to return."}
{"text":"Rotisserie chicken at its best. We were traveling through and had the craving for Peruvian chicken and found this on yelp. Going there thinking there is no way this place will be as good as Pio Pio back in NYC but was I wrong. I am not saying its better than Pio Pio but it is definitely right up there. Viva does have Pio Pio beat on the free rang all natural chicken that they use. And their sauce, oh the sauce super delicious, all 3 heat levels but I must say the red sauce is definitely the best out of the 3. The stuffed avocado was also amazing and I saved the best to last, their tres leches cake....omg....omg...it is to die for. By far the best tres leches I've ever had. Took 5 slices home with me. I would give it a 5 star but I feel like I would be betraying Pio Pio. ;)"}
{"text":"Peruvian chicken, wow this place is awesome. I was craving it for three days straight after I went there my first time. All the sauces are delicious and the rotisserie chicken was tender and spiced just right. I've been back many times since and their consistency is great.

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place great food great service.
Love the concept. Roasting chickens is something simple and complex at the same time and sometimes simple things are the best. There is a few decent place in charlotte where you can get rotisserie chicken and I think that I have visited most of them .but no place like viva chicken !!"}
{"text":"Fast Fresh Healthy Inexpensive & DELICIOUS!  Definitely enjoyed it. The chicken melts in your mouth and the cilantro lime rice is awesome.  The best thing on the menu is the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado - add chicken!  Will be back soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place- the rotisserie chicken is the best- I always pair with yucca and green beans.  The sauces are to die for and herbal lemonade is bomb. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, Delish!! I'm having a giant wrap with beef, rice, beans, avocado, and red onion. Wow!! Fried sweet plantains are perfect. I dipped them in one of the sauce they give you a choice of. I chose green, it's nice heat to it. Tastes like cilantro and jalapeño.  I also ordered the stuffed avocado with quinoa, so delicious! Everything really good!!"}
{"text":"First time checking out this spot, my good friend loves this place so I took her here for her birthday and I was not disappointed. The walk to the counter I was greeted by the smiling cashier that made ordering super easy. We both got the 1/4 chicken with two sides. I choose the yuca & cilantro infused rice as my sides and it was def comforting to have a meal that tasted like my meal I cook at home. So with that, I'll be coming here when I don't feel like cooking.  

They also have a variety of sides like quinoa and so much more. Also offer sangria which was super tasty! I will def go back to this spot when am
In the concord area."}
{"text":"I am always a fan of this chain. Especially, this location is too convenient. They have a separate counter for takeout- called Call in to order. This section also has seating area for people who have placed order for takeout. The customer service is quick and efficient , unlike the other location at Elizabeth , which is always crowded and waiting lines are longer than expected. 
Viva Chicken, please come to northeast - NYC, NJ soon."}
{"text":"Beautiful chicken! :) Yes, I love their cilantro infused rice as well as the chicken of course. So well marinated and the chicken actually melts away in your mouth. Loved this place. It is so simple and easier to stop by anytime of the day and have a full meal like a 1/4 chicken with rice and beans, or just the avocado stuffed with quinoa and chicken. These two are my favorites. Their sauces are amazing!! 
Overall, I wish Viva chicken opens up in the NYC metro area as well."}
{"text":"I recently went to Viva Chicken with my pretty picky family. We were all impressed by this place!

The chicken was well-seasoned and moist. The rice was nice and sticky. The green beans (which I don't eat ever, but tried them to see what they were like) were INCREDIBLE. My mom's \"The Great\" bowl and fries (oh my word, those fries) were awesome too! We also got the chocolate cake and the tres leches cake, which were to DIE for. And the herbal lemonade was surprisingly yummy (but there were no refills on it).

The yellow-y sauce that they give you is PERFECTION. My mom and I dipped everything that we got in that sauce. I took home a container, used it as dressing, and fell even more in love. My stepmom tried it and fell in love too. We've both declared it as our favorite sauce ever. I want to buy a bottle and use it on EVERYTHING.

This place was pretty great, and I only don't give it five stars because I don't think it has enough seating and the people working at the registers weren't the nicest. The food was great though. I'm definitely going again!"}
{"text":"I had the classic saltado, it was delicious. The steak was well cooked and the fries were amazing."}
{"text":"Great food! The stuffed avocado is a must try. The wraps are great too. The restaurant us always clean and airy. If you go during the mid day rush you may feel rushed by the staff. Great place to enjoy a healthy option on the go."}
{"text":"Great food, and good portions!  Try the passion fruit juice!  It's not quite as good as what you'll get in South America, but was the best I've had in the USA."}
{"text":"I just got a Quinoa Stuffed Avocado and added Roasted Chicken to go. It was literally one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. Huge portion too. I'm trying to decide if it would be weird to go back for dinner. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu. The place smells like heaven too when you walk in. Only complaint, I thought some items were kinda pricey. My meal came to $10.75 and it's on the app menu. But whatever, it was so good it's worth it."}
{"text":"Tasty food for lunch in a place that's really cranking but handling it well. There is plenty of service staff roaming the floor to make sure everyone has what they need (and to keep em moving)."}
{"text":"So so good.  The sauce they have for their chicken (yellow sauce) is awesome! I want to take a jar of it home with me!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly tasty! Who knew rotisserie chicken could be so yum. Loved he yucca fries & the desserts were spot on. Tons of food for a good price"}
{"text":"Summary: They were rude. I walked out. 

I had never seen the menu before. I was taking some time to look it over. This apparently was a problem for the people taking the orders.

At one point, the two people behind the counter literally started talking about me as I stood there looking at the menu board. There was no one behind me at that point. But the guy taking the orders put his hand on his mouth and whispered to the other one \"He can't decide what he wants.\"

\"That is true,\" I said. The guy looks at me, and walks away. 

Now, no one else was ordering at the time. I was alone in the line. So, why does this place need two people to NOT be helpful and offer to answer questions I might have about the menu or offer suggestions? 

One unhelpful employee would seem sufficient and would be far more efficient.

At that point, I finally noticed that they have little paper menus also. So, I took one of those and walked away.

And while I'm looking over the little paper menu, I processed what had just happened. And I decided I didn't need to waste time or money in a place that didn't want my business. 

Now that I'm writing this, I feel like an idiot for wasting that extra minute or so looking over the paper menu."}
{"text":"Best chicken in Charlotte! Green beans and yuca fries are amazing. I'd eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"Best. Chicken. Ever. And the green beans are amazing. My husband who doesn't like chicken loves this place. It's just that good."}
{"text":"Seriously for the flavors are phenomenal!! Went here with a group of 5 and we loved everything we got! Value is great as well! We were just in charlotte for a day and half and wish we went here more often!"}
{"text":"I've now been to Viva Chicken three times, and I've only ordered the Quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken. It. Is. SOOOO. Good!!! Everyone is so polite and the atmosphere is very nice. One time, we ordered from here for lunch. I was glad we ordered online as it was PACKED when I got there to pick it up. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"As a resident of Charlotte I'm on a mission to find the top 20 restaurants in the city..! And I think I've decided on my first 1...! There's a lot of things that goes into being on the list atmosphere, staff knowledge meant of menu , hospitality and most of all quality and taste the food..! Now understand this list is not in no particular order..! But congratulations to Viva Chicken..! I love everything about this place and I will be back..! Atmosphere allows you to bring a date , have family time or just hang out a great job..!#@Viva chicken?"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken was better than I anticipated. We got a family meal with an extra side. The staff at the counter was very helpful. We told her that it was our first time and asked for recommendations. Her recommendations were perfect. My family wished the plantains were cut smaller before they were cooked, but I liked them as they were."}
{"text":"got the sopa de pollo for a friend who was sick because i didn't know where else to get chicken noodle soup.. and it was surprisingly super filling! has rice in it plus lots of chicken.. definitely a filling soup!

they have gift cards too FYI!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Consistently great food in a fast-casual environment. The tacu bowl is delicious, flavorful, and reasonably healthy for a meal out! Full of fresh veggies, tender chicken, and perfectly cooked rice and beans. This is my go-to takeout food and has completely replaced chipotle for me from a \"burrito bowl\" standpoint. You can order online so your meal is ready when you get there which is fantastic because it tends to get crowded with long lines at the counter. 

Whatever you do, don't forget to grab some sauces! The yellow (mild) and green (medium) are my favorites. If you're one of those picky chicken people, you can request all white meat in anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent good the stuffed avocados the fried yuca and plantains and chicken where delicious will come again"}
{"text":"So excited for this new Concord location to open.  This place never disappoints.  Quick, delicious, Peruvian chicken.  The locations are always clean, the staff is friendly.  This new location has a great outdoor patio.  So many favorites on their menu the chicken, cilantro infused rice, canary beans, yuca, quinoa stuffed avocado.... its hard to pick just one item.  Their house made sauces are addictive!  I have to have one of each color every visit.  YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My husband and I are addicted and got our friends addicted to it too! I always get the same thing: quinoa stuffed avocado, whole chicken (all white) , cilantro rice, green beans, canary beans and tres leches (to die for) for dessert! Also be sure to get the sauces. I love all 3!"}
{"text":"Viva Chicken is pure awesome.  Delicious seasoning, so juicy and tender, with three dipping sauces to complement.  The yuca, salad, and chicken soup sides were also outstanding.  Very clean place with friendly staff.  Please expand beyond Charlotte!"}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite place for chicken.  We've gotten their $18.95 whole chicken combo a few times now, and haven't been disappointed yet.  We'll pick one up for carry-out, and every one is still moist and delicious by the time we get home.  The plantains are pretty tasty and their beans have a special place in my heart.  I'm not normally a big fan of that style of bean, but these just rock my socks.  Their sauces are what really set them appart though.  They have three different sauces all at different heat levels, but each also has it's own unique flavor.  My favorite is the light green one, but all three are great, and I don't find them to be too hot.   

The combo will feed us both for a couple days, or we'll use the chicken in a recipe.  At that price it's pretty hard to beat.  I'm pretty sure Viva will remain our go to place for that lazy night when we just can't decide what to make or get."}
{"text":"Can not speak highly enough of this place. I always get the 1/4 chicken with two sides of sweet potato fries and their quinoa avocados! Pair their deliciously seasoned chicken and sweet potato fries with that red sauce they have !!! Heaven"}
{"text":"Great place good lunch. Food is steps above chipotle and the atmosphere is great. Definitely try the Chicha morada our the Herbal tea."}
{"text":"Addictive. The best chicken in Charlotte.  Crisp skin, layers of flavor. The sandwiches are delicious and filling. Try the Wow Lomito - it will linger in your taste memory, you'll return for another one. The side dishes, especially the plantains are perfection. So worth the trip. Expect to wait, too many people know how good it is!"}
{"text":"The food here is soooooo good, but man do they need to work on getting their pickup orders right. Considering the taste of all of the food here and the kind staff at this place I wouldn't hesitate giving this place 5 or more stars. But I did have to dock it 1 star since the last 2 times Ive picked up takeout from here I got it home to realize it wasn't the correct order. Perhaps getting sandwiches for takeout versus just chicken and sides makes it too complicated for the folks that put the takeout orders together. 

For the past couple of years of getting takeout ( and eat in) from this place I have never had an issue until the last month or so. About a month ago I ordered the naked peruvian sandwich with steak on ciabatta etc. When I got it back to the house the sandwich only had steak onions and tomatoes on it. I was so disappointed (since what I actually ordered is super yum) that I called in to the store. They didn't hesitate in offering me a corrected sandwich if I wanted to come back in or a credit for the one I ordered and paid for the next time I went in. I took the latter option since I was already in my comfy clothes in front of a movie at home. That couldn't have been any more painless.

Fast forward a month to last night when I got take out again. Called in on the way to place the order. We were planning on getting the sandwich we had a credit for and 2 orders of the quinoa stuffed avocado....I mean we all love those right?! We called in and the guy on the other end of the phone told me the worst news I had heard all day ....\"WE ARE OUT OF THE QUINOA STUFFED AVOCADOS\". Those words echoed in my head like a nightmare that would never end. What was I to do? How could I go on (with my order)? We settled for 2 of the naked peruvians. One with steak and one with pulled chicken, both with the bean soup, 2 herbal lemonades (liquid heaven) and a tres leche cake. We checked it when got in the car to make sure everything was there and it appeared to be that it was right and we had 2 naked peruvians, but when we got it home we noticed both the sandwiches had steak...no pulled chicken in sight. Didn't have the energy or balls to call again but considering the list they had for credits this isn't too rare of an occurrence. Both times the receipt said the correct order so had to have just been made wrong. Oh well...food sure was delicious though, as always.

One more gripe/compliment combo to throw in to the mix. Consider this a plea if you would like to. But why in the world would they get rid of the passionfruit mousse? That stuff was so friggin good. Please bring it back!! Ive tried all the other desserts at this point and while good they don't come close to the passionfruit mousse. Hear my cries."}
{"text":"Viva Chicken! Yes Long Live the Chicken! This Peruvian style cuisine fits the idea of great seasoning without the spice. Chicken is flavourful and embodies a richness of moisture and is well cooked. On the other hand, if you have spicy palate like myself you may want to order this chicken to go. The spicy condiments provided are 3 varieties of spice, but if you consider spice to be filled with a habanero, Scotch bonnet, or a ghost pepper then the 3 spices offered are not for you.  The Yucca (Cassava) fries are my favourite thing next to the chicken. It is crisp, crunchy on the outside and has soft inside.  After every bite, I felt I had both fried and boiled yucca (cassava). 
Alfajore cookies should be made a tad bit similar with a high quantity. That would preserve a bit of authenticity to the cookies. Although, I know this place is sort of a fast food Peruvian spot. 
Salad balsamic dressing has a sweet taste and bite sour bite to it. It is mostly cabbage, onions and tomatoes with cucumber.
Juices are pretty extremely sweet, I found myself consistently mixing it with water. 

Outdoor Patio area is a terrific place to get work done with a nice beer!"}
{"text":"Holy moly this place is AMAZING!!! Our food was unique and crazy DELICIOUS! I fell in love with their Inca chicken wrap and added the yellow sauce. I would have put that yellow in my cereal if I could. The food was fresh and didn't make me feel overly full. My mom ordered the quinoa stuffed avocado and it looks and tasted great. This is our new favorite spot! Very clean and service was great. I speak Spanish and it was nice talking with them about their menu."}
{"text":"This just was not my favorite- the other peruvian chicken place where sabor now is located was better than this for me."}
{"text":"The naked \"wrap\" (we got it with ciabatta) is delicious with the chicken added. Tres Leches  always makes me smile."}
{"text":"Food is great! Passion juice is great, salads ,side dishes but best of all avocados dish is unbelievable"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is about with this place.  The service was good... there were employees everywhere bussing tables and running food etc. so that was good.  The prices seemed a bit expensive.

I ordered the half chicken with solterito and cilantro infused rice.  The chicken was just ok... it reminded me of a grocery store rotisserie chicken. About the same flavor but maybe a bit more greasy.  The solterito was good and the feta cheese gave it great flavor.  The cilantro infused rice was bland but after adding one of the sauces it was much better.

meh."}
{"text":"Love this place. My bf got a job here after tasting the food. The chicken is GREAT! Really everything on the menu is delicious. They have a many vegetarian options, but you can also add chicken or steak to them. Two of my favorites are The Great sandwich with provolone and bacon, and the Peruvian fried rice with chicken. They have fried yucca which is amazing, if you haven't had it before, get it. And I know it seems weird to mention, but this place has really good French fries. Go, try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wonderfully juicy marinated chicken, incredible herbal limeade, yummy yuca fries, sweet and crispy plantains, edamame pepper salad: Solterito. Great stuff! The desserts I could've left... tres leches cake was ok, very creamy but needed more flavor, alfajores cookies (shortbread with caramel/dulce de leche) were extremely crumbly.

Price point is around $10 per person. We ordered the family meal which includes a whole chicken and 3 sides. Perfect amount for 3-4 people if you order drinks or dessert.

I went during Sunday lunch and the place was so busy! Good sign. We found a table for 4 people and squeezed 5. The food came quickly considering the sheer amount of people there. The place looked clean and organized. Their mission was inspiring because they try to be green with recyclable plates, cutlery, and napkins.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Viva Chicken in Concord at the suggestion of my hairdresser. She herself is a very good cook, and can be very picky about other people's food. I was not disappointed, I went on a Saturday afternoon because I was in the Mall area (I rarely shop on Saturdays, but this was an exception) and decided to take her advice. Although the restaurant was crowded, the line moved quickly and efficiently. I ordered takeout of 1/4 white meat chicken, the cilantro infused rice, and the string beans. Alejandro, my front counter server, very graciously allowed me a sample of the rice because I was unsure of the taste, and I am a rice lover! It was so good, I ordered a second for the next day. The chicken was very tasty, well cooked and moist, and the string beans were fresh. I remember when they began building this site, and I am glad I finally got to visit. I will definitely visit again, either to eat in or take out, just not on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"Good Salvadorian Food. Always clean. 1/4 chicken and salad are my favorites with plantain. If you want a super-sized serving, their rice with choice of chicken or steak is cooked to perfection. Good job."}
{"text":"The goods: 
The chicken is EXCELLENT!! We also enjoyed the lime/cilantro rice a lot! The serve your own sauces were a nice compliment to the food and it was nice to have a fresh fruit option as a side. 

The not as goods: 
The quinoa was unimpressive. Slightly over-cooked and bland. The Solerito was, unfortunately, not that great. The line/order/delivery system is a bit of a mess (during busy times, at least) and only one ice-machine & drink area. The place was packed so that got a little crazy!

Overall we REALLY enjoyed this trip. The food was well worth the money despite not enjoying a couple of the sides (next time..2 orders of rice!) Will go back for durned tooting sure!"}
{"text":"Price, quality of food and ambience make this a must go! We came here for lunch on a weekday and it was packed! We ordered for 4 people the whole chicken with 3 sides: solterito, plantains and the cilantro rice. Ok, so the solterito is basically a salad with corn, edamame and tomatoes that is on point! Both the rice and solterito came in big portions, but the plantains were in a small container, so I'm not sure about that for the side portion size. Ok, I know this is weird but the FRIES are amazing. We ordered an extra side of these. I don't know what they coated them with, but they were crispy, hot and perfect. We weren't able to finish all the food with the 4 of us! So good portion size!

Chicken was really good, white meat was a bit dry but, nothing was too salty. I think it's a great deal. I asked about the drinks b/c I would have gotten them if they didn't have sugar in them butttt they did, so I opted out just b/c I'm trying to eat less sugar!"}
{"text":"Cheap, creative, flavorful, in a relaxed atmosphere. Order at the counter and food is brought to the table. This is my go to place for a quick wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Good food. Great for my family I eat. Order at the counter, sit down and they bring it out to you. Chicken was juicy, yuca fries were like fried potato pillows. So fluffy in the inside. Didn't get any dessert but it looked good. Rice bowls looked big. Might get that next time."}
{"text":"Everything is FANTASTIC ALL THE TIME. I started with the stuffed avocados.  I couldn't stop ordering them. Their chicken is some of the best I'll ever have!! The avocados are soooo delicious. Then I tried a wrap, the wow lomito. YAS. So good!!! The flavors are insane and the sun dried tomato wrap is great. Classic Saltado- AMAZING. Even their FRIES are insane!!! Choose your sauce wisely, the hotter the better!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Have had the Naked Peruvian, Inca wrap, and the Qinoa Stuffed Avocado and have to say I was not disappointed with any of those. The sauces are quite tasty - I preferred the spicier sauce. Have been there a couple of times for lunch and one take-out dinner. It is also a fave with my two kids."}
{"text":"Ok so back to the basics this is a 5/5
- Chicken is absolutely DELICIOUS, juicy and perfectly seasoned. 
- The sopa de pollo tastes like home! 
- The fries fresh and crispy 
AND THE AJÍES BAR OMG!!! The ají amarillo is soooooo good. 
The people: amazing! Viva made my day today"}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is always on point. Try the Inca Wrap, so delicious!"}
{"text":"There are few restaurants in the area that offer gluten free options that are actually tasty and this is my top pick! The chicken soup, arroz con pollo, and quinoa stuffed avocado are all amazing. The staff is super helpful and friendly. They do tend to get pretty busy during lunch and dinner but it's well worth the wait! Also be sure to try their herbal lemonade it's to die for"}
{"text":"We love everything about Viva Chicken. The food is to die for! So fresh and unique. My husband can not live without their balsamic dressing :) Everything we have tried is always fantastic. Not to mention the service is always 100% They are so kind, helpful and extremely attentive!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic food. This place is a keeper. Price is also reasonable. It was about $8 for a rotisserie chicken. Would definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"Just happy this restaurant is open. So far so good. Love that it is close to the movie theater and 10 minutes from my house. We need more fresher food options in this area."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I never thought I would like visiting a restaurant that has \"chicken\" in the name, but this place was fantastic! It is upscale fast dining with wonderfully fresh food. I got the Tiku bowl (which is easily 2-3 servings, depending on how hungry you are) which featured canary beans, cilantro rice, pickled vegetables, and I added avocado for a small upcharge. It was DIVINE!! I also tried the Yucca fries which are crispy and completely unlike french fries. 

There are SO MANY vegetarian options, but I think the Tiku bowl is the best bang for my buck. 

I highly recommend this place and plan to take everyone I know :-)."}
{"text":"If you're reading this trying to decide whether to go or not...just go and you'll be very happy. I got the quarter chicken white and half chicken stuffed quinoa avocado. I forgot the side I got but maybe the sweet potato fries. The chicken is tasty and if you're trying to eat healthy you can do it with just that. If you're trying to eat healthy and want the stuffed avocado order it without the sauce. Still great and I really didn't think it needed it anyway. 

Get all three of the sauces and start dipping away. The hottest sauce isn't really hot at all and you'll like the change of pace with each one. I didn't get the green or purple drinks, just iced tea but my co-worker did and loved the green drink. 

Place gets packed but what place that has great food isn't?"}
{"text":"Delicious! 

The customer service was fantastic! It's my first time here and they helped out tremendously! The chicken was even better tho!"}
{"text":"I love Viva Chicken! I've come here several times and loved everything I've had.

My go to orders are the quinoa stuffed avocado salad with chicken and the friend rice with dark meat chicken. The fried rice portion is huge, you'll definitely have leftovers. You have to try the dipping sauces too. I love the house made juices they have! All of them are very good, but my favorite is the herbal limeade. The yucca fries and alfajores are also good.

It is so loud during lunch here. It's crowded with really bad acoustics and they play really loud music. Parking is also a pain at lunch. 

The last time I was there, they didn't shred the chicken and it was really dry. I think it was an anomaly though because it's been great every other time. 

I love the food and it's unique for Charlotte. I would highly recommend trying Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible!! Just walk in, go to the counter, order and grab a seat. I had a delicious 1/4 chicken with cilantro rice and house salad. The chicken is delicious!! The cilantro rice was perfect! But what really made this place delicious was the sauces!! OMG try them all. Each is different and delicious!! I enjoyed this so much! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Best Peruvian/Latin food restaurant in the Charlotte area. Portions are great, presentation, taste and concept are perfect every time. There has been not one single thing we didn't like, half chicken, yuca, stuffed avocado, tres leches, sandwiches, salads, passion fruit juice...could go on forever!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here than go. If you don't like it then get help because your a crazy person!"}
{"text":"Jumping on the bandwagon but love, love the quinoa stuffed avocados... Have tried the baked chicken, soup, rice bowl... All well done. Nice place for a quick, fairly inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"This was a great find!  We're in town for a few days and saw a line out the door. We go by the mantra of \"if you see a line for food, get in it because something good is coming.\"  Viva absolutely lived up to that. We didn't realize it was a chain, but who cares?  It smelled awesome as soon as we walked in, and the chicken, rice, and plantains didn't disappoint. There was a huge crowd for lunch, but service was great nonetheless. The green sauce is my favorite - I could drink this stuff!  The tres leches cake was amazing. PLEASE open one of these in Nashville!!!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness.  Has that reeled you in yet?  I had stopped by Viva Chicken for lunch and I fell totally in love with it.  Alright, I didn't have a chicken dish, but the Classic Saltado sounded too good to pass up.  The place is small, but I don't care, I was more interested in the food since it smelled so good upon walking in.  I ordered my food at the counter and it wasn't too long of a wait to get my food.  I would recommend to hurry up and get a table as it can get pretty crowded during a lunch rush!  The sauces that came with my dish were to die for!  I just kept dipping and dipping.  No shame man, no shame. 

What's cool about this place?  They are also very eco friendly!  Yay for trying to go green!  The servers are wonderful and everyone is so super nice.  When I had ordered at the register, the guy probably noticed I was a first timer and let me know about the dishes I had questions on and also informed me that they have a loyalty card.  Did I get a punch that day?  Heck yeah I did!  I plan on going back for more punches in my card!

I've definitely have to go back and try some of their chicken dishes too!"}
{"text":"Sooo good with healthy eating options!! 

I got the 1/4 chicken with cilantro rice and sweet plantains. 
Omg the cilantro rice is amazing, definitely will be using their recipe for my rice at home. 
There chicken is pretty amazing and sauces are so good along. You can choose between white meat and dark meat.
Sweet plantains were soo good I wish I had more than 4 LOL. I usually can't ever finished my food but it was that good .

CONS; lines can be so long that should expand their checkout 
Tres leches cake; not really a fan at all. There's a half of a inch of milk at the bottom of the container which I've never seen before. It was good but wasn't the traditional tres leches cake"}
{"text":"Horrible at answering their phone and when they do after leaving you on hold 5 minutes or hanging up on you they are rude and have no phone etiquette."}
{"text":"Good prices,  fresh food,  bright ambience,  staff is super friendly, the outdoor patio is shaded, they accept the Ballantyne Corporate Discount card... yeah,  they rock!"}
{"text":"I have eaten takeout from Viva Chicken several times, so we decided to take out of town guests here for a casual meal. It's a little noisy and chaotic inside, but the food is worth it. The plantains were some of the best we've ever had, and all the sauces are delicious. Love that you can try (taste) their specialty beverages. Next time I'm getting one!"}
{"text":"This place has become my go-to. It's fast, friendly, and most importantly delicious. Get the Viva chicken salad. It's simple, but has all of my faves: feta, avocado, red onion, chicken, and the most addictive sweet balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I usually order extra dressing -- it's that good. There are three locations, and I only wish is that they expand to the South End. It gets so busy, but the staff is great about getting your food out quickly. 

I'm new to Charlotte, so I can't wait to try the other items on the menu. But geez, that salad is so good it seems like sacrilege to deviate from my norm."}
{"text":"The chicken was a little dry the first time we went...it was late, but still.  The second time a little better.  Loved the Purple juice, very different.  Not sure I was overwhelmed with the service.  Let's just say they don't go overboard to please, but it was mediocre.  Clean location in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Although incredibly crowded and a significant wait for a takeout sandwich at lunch time, Wow Lomito is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had! Well worth it!"}
{"text":"So delicious every time.  My favorite and go-to is the quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken with a side of plantains.  But every thing I have had off of their menu is great!  And I cannot say enough about their french fries.  Maybe the best in Charlotte.  Seriously, I could eat the whole basket of them - perfectly crispy and hot on the outside but still soft on the inside.  Service is always great and food comes out quickly, even when very busy at lunch time!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great, inexpensive place to eat with nice portions, this is the spot!! Everything we got was good! My fiancé and I got the quinoa stuffed avocado (amazing when you add chicken), the whole chicken, green beans, plantains and fresh fruit. Came in hungry and left stuffed with satisfaction. Our meal was only $30 too! I'll be back quite often after this"}
{"text":"I have been here in the past to dine in. This time I did carry out. I arrived durning the busy lunch rush and just as last time the place was hopping. Only problem is the place doesn't have a lot of room so if you are waiting for food to carry out there is really no place to stand without leaning over someone's table as the eat or in the way as others pass by. I guess that's a good problem to have (being busy that is). When I arrived home the food was the bomb actually better than when I had it from this location in the past. Over all would I return yes."}
{"text":"Very good peruvian chicken. Love the green sauce can't wait to go back and try something new"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY love this place. The tacu bowl is to die for and so is the limena chopped salad. Really anything you get here you won't go wrong. Their 3 sauces they offer are all delicious and I usually end up using all three. They also have sangria which is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken, sides, and service.  We were very pleased with our lunch at Viva Chicken.  The only fault I would give them is the 1/4 chicken was tiny for a $9 meal.  The sides were excellent and made up for the portion.  I wouldn't give this a 5 star review as I wasn't blown away by the place, but will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic option for fast casual with very high quality and tasty food.  My new favorite place.  Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is my jam!! Quinoa stuffed avocados are fantastic. Along with the rice and sweet potato fries. To go orders are quick and friendly too. Keep up the good work viva, I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"It was super good. I think its super expensive for chicken but very good. You can get the Pruvian chicken at wholefoods just a few doors down but I guess the sides will not come with it. But neither wil the price tag. I though the taste was amazing and some of the sides were good.The sweet potato fries were soggy by the time we got home but the chicken tasted great"}
{"text":"Love viva chicken.  Wish they had an APP  as we like to order it on the way home and pick it up. Each time I have to fill in all the info again. If I had an account it woudl make it easier.  But love the freshness of the food and the sides. yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!  Love the Viva Chicken Salad & Viva Chicken Caesar Salads especially."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Delicious food. Love the Inca wrap with pulled chicken. Super picky father in law couldn't get enough of the rotisserie chicken and rice. Can't get enough."}
{"text":"Okay. Pretty fast, nice environment. Do not like the side rice and green beans. Like the side plaintain and chicken soup."}
{"text":"This Viva Chicken location is very clean and like any other location it's amazing and a must visit! Great environment and interior. The staffs are extremely helpful and friendly. 

Food is delicious like always. I'd never had Peruvian food but Viva Chicken made me fall in love with it. I love their taco bowl and quinoa stuffed avocado. The flavor and quality of food was amazing for a so-called fast food. Not to mention, I'm in love with their sauces as well!

4-stars because sometimes they put so much sauce on my quinoa stuffed avocado and the chicken in the wrap was dry. The price is reasonable for only some dishes.

I would definitely come back to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It's fast and efficient. We usually get the whole rotisserie chicken with Cilantro rice, beans and plantains. The sauces are awesome, especially the green one. I'd pass on the sangria. It's not that good, but honestly everything else is. Try the tres Leche. It's wonderful and it's super easy to order online. We go a couple times a month."}
{"text":"Sweet Goodness this place is amazing! I have traveled all over and you can not find many places like this. Everything we had was great. Chicken is cooked to perfection and the sides are top notch. I highly recommend this place to anyone and I will be bringing friends back!"}
{"text":"Viva chicken is definitely good, I've been to other Peruvian restaurants the only one that is as good as here is genaros. The first time I got the 1/2 chicken with infused rice and sweet potato fries, the chicken is very moist and tastes great, the infused rice is full of flavor and the sweet potato fries are pretty good too. The have three sauces, a green, yellow, and red sauce, red being the spiciest and down in heat to yellow then green being the least spicy, they are all very good. This time I got the Arroz Chaufa, my sister got it last time and it was a little salty so all you have to do is tell them to be light on the soy sauce and it is delicious, and then you top it with some of their sauce and its even better. Oh and I can't forget the passion fruit juice! You have to get some no matter what! It is sooo good. So if you want some chicken, come to Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"I love this place because it is fast, easy, healthy (options), fresh and friendly.  

I love the chicken tacu bowl...all white meat.  The garlic green sauce that comes with it is HOT but so good.  I hate that they charge for extra because that little container it comes in gets me through about 3 bites.  

Last time I got the bowl I asked them for more beans and less rice.  Depending on who is working I will get all rice stacked up and like 2 pieces of chicken.  No bueno.  I need more beans, less rice and a buttload of chicken.  I don't need all the onions that come on top either.  

Anyway, overall scrumptious joint.  Price is right, atmosphere works and the service is typically super friendly/helpful.  Both locations are pretty consistent so I am a fan."}
{"text":"Finally made my way over to the much anticipated Viva Chicken and I was NOT disappointed!

I tried the chicken salad and we also ordered \"the great\" chicken sandwich on ciabatta with a side of sweet potato fries.  Both items were great. 

The place is fresh, clean, sleek, friendly and fast.  The staff was super friendly and I actually heard my stomach thank me after I completed my meal.

I love how everything is made in-house and that they have some great healthy options.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Love their menu selection! Always fresh and tasty. My favorite part is their patio- nice and cozy! I highly recommend Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"What hasn't been already said? 

I came here because it seemed like a good choice. I'm attempting to start a ketogenic lifestyle with my coworker recently starting a vegetarian lifestyle.

The food at this location is much better than the Huntersville location. The only thing I don't care for (which is pretty much the standard in the area) is that it is tight at lunchtime and there may be difficulty finding a table. 

I ordered the 1/4 chicken (dark meat) with side of fruit and house salad. The chicken was delicious. The fruit was also very fresh; it was just disappointing that it was mainly apples and 1 piece mandarin orange- no berries in sight. The balsamic dressing is to die for! So yummy. 

Definitely a good place to get a healthy, \"clean\" meal that is high quality but reasonably priced."}
{"text":"A great addition to the Concord area. 

Viva chicken with their delicious rotisserie chicken does it again! Like other locations, service was good, food was delicious, and the restaurant was clean! They have a nice outdoor area and the dining area is very well laid out.

I got the Viva Salad and added chicken and was not disappointed at all."}
{"text":"We came for the 1st time and we have ana amazing experience service was excellent... We get Pollo ala brasa"}
{"text":"Thank you so much to my friends who introduced me to this flavor explosion.

After going to Peru a few years ago, I've been jonesing for some seriously delicious Peruvian chicken and everywhere I turned, I was let down. 

[[*Enters Viva Chicken*]]

We were looking for a quick fix, with flavor and a level of spice, so my friends suggested Viva Chicken. Knowing this was \"fast food\" I was seriously skeptical on how good this Peruvian style chicken would actually be. Much to my surprise, it was awesome!

My fiance and I split a plate because we had no idea what to order. We wound up with 1/4 chicken and two sides. Naturally one of the sides was yucca fries and the other was quinoa. Wow! I was blown away with the flavor, and I loved the additional sauces that you could opt for on the side. Be sure to get one of their spicy sauces because it will tempt those taste buds. 

Since Peru, I've been craving the Chicha Morada. It's a sweet purple fruit juice made from purple corn. There is nothing like it. It's a refreshing flavor and Viva Chicken captures the sweetness. It's a little weird, but you have to try it.

I can't wait to come to make another stop here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant get there early it is tight seating.  Chicken is well seasoned and juicy but hte show stoppers are the sides the plaintains are kick ass as well as the other vegtables like the green beans are spot on.  Desserts are also amazing.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service is awesome. The food is equally awesome. I love the classic saltado- sirloin seasoned very well over crunchy French fries, peppers onions and rice. Heavenly. Could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"I am a Peruvian fan, and was very excited to see a new one open up, close to me. I am a Pio Pio fan, but what a treat Viva Chicken was. The service, extraordinary. At the counter, the server greeted me w/ a smile, asked if it was 1st visit.  Indeed it was and she was great, explaining everything and making recommendations based on what I liked. I received my number and was served w/in a few minutes. The waitress explained the sauces that accompanied my chicken and pointed out which went best w/ each dish. The rice and beans were amazing! A great new edition to the city, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Viva. It's a relatively healthy and inexpensive option for dinner. My favorite item on their menu is the avocado stuffed with quinoa. Their chicken is pretty good but not the best, and the same with the sides that I have tried: sweet potato fries, plantains, corn salad, and green beans. I definitely recommend for a quick and inexpensive dinner!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times, and have always loved everything I've gotten. So much flavor, and great customer service!

I went this past week, and asked for the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado, specifying multiple times that I was a vegetarian and did not want any chicken added. The staff was great and confirmed multiple times there was no chicken....

Got all the way home and half way through my meal when I came across my first bite of chicken. Despite the efforts, two nickel sized pieces managed to make their way into my dish. I understand I walked into a restaurant that specializes in chicken, and these things happen. However, after the care that the staff and I took in specifying my request, it was really disappointing.

Again, love this establishment and their food! Hoping there is a more care in the customer's food preparation next visit."}
{"text":"How can you not love Viva???  Do yourself a favor and try The Great on a wrap with Avocado!! Yuuum..."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian chicken in the QC!  Amazing!! Some of the best food in Charlotte!  I eat here once a week.  Chicken is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The sauces and Inca cola are winners and the alfojores are one of my peruvian favorites. My friend from Peru brought me here and I've been hooked ever since."}
{"text":"This place is LIT (that means good).

I get the half chicken with plantains and fried Yucca. Unreal. Meat always juicy and seasoned with the magical blend. The sauces are absolutely killer too. The lines can be long sometimes and finding a seat can be tricky but I have never had a problem with the food. Ultimately that is what you come here for, right?"}
{"text":"Dear lord this place has the best chicken ever. Juicy and tender. And the sauce on the side... and the plantains. I've never really been able to try anything but the chicken because it's so good... yum. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After Chipotle Took Off!!!

here comes another avenue in ethnic foods to use the motto of \"authentic food fast\".  Here we have Peruvian food witch is awesome in any restaurant or taqueria that includes it. If you had Boston Market, if you had Chipotle, imagine that with extra spice and more delicately made dark chicken.  Not much healthy here but they have good spice level to reach an indian audience. 

I came in with coworkers and parked in a parking lot that was nice but had craters for potholes.  The area part of Novant hospital discrict so expect lots of nurses during a lunch hour.  The line is fast if you come prepared for your order.  I recommend chicken or Inca Wrap.  I ordered the inca Wrap witch for some reason came last in our party of 6.  They do bring it out to your table and your given a number. 

The wrap was awesome as it had huge chicken chunks and lots of rice and veggies. The sides of plaintains and rice were awesome as well.  

I spent 12.50 including drink"}
{"text":"A favorite lunch stop for me. The staff is friendly, always saying hello. They offer great take out packaging, and if dining in they sure do get your order out quick! Excellent menu with enough variety to keep trying something new- or stick to your favorites. They got this concept right, just wish it were closer to where I work/live. Parking may vary, but it's worth the walk. Viva Chicken won't let you down."}
{"text":"Great place to come after a tiring day at Concord Mill Mall or before a movie at the Cinema. Great Rotisserie taste and price to match."}
{"text":"I love their rotisserie chicken. It's very flavorful. And the half chicken is a great way to share between 2 people for $11.50 (with 2 sides). Quarter chicken is $8.25, so unless you really need 2 sides each, you have just saved yourself $5. I always enjoy the fried yuca & sweet plantains, but lately I'm hooked on the cilantro rice. Most importantly I like the green and yellow sauces that come with each dish. Be warned: it's garlicky, don't plan on kissing anyone afterward without a serious mint or mouth wash.

Recently we walked in right after closing time (9pm) and the manager waved us in. I always like to give credit to places for not turning away diners (next time I'll know better). 

The patio is very quaint and a nice quiet spot to enjoy a conversation. 
And oh, they just started a new reward program, it's on an iPad in front of the register. Key in the phone # and it'll log in your spending."}
{"text":"I came here on a road trip a few months ago and really enjoyed their veggie options. Good, solid food"}
{"text":"It was very nice chicken place, staff was friendly, place was clean, food was okay. I would recommend people trying out this establishment at least if they have never been.  However, it wasn't for me.

Everything about the place was good, but for mine own taste, the chicken and sauces were pretty plain and ordinary.  I got 1/2 chicken meal and it didn't fill me up. Also, the sweet potato fires and rice were very plain and dry. Also, I didn't see what was so special about the sauces that the offered at the bar.

It was ok, just not great.  People should definitely go and try it out for themselves. But its not for me."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I will definitely be back to try more. I got the pulled chicken sandwich with yucca fries. Both were delicious, I loved the sauce on the sandwich. The staff is very friendly & accommodating. The atmosphere is nice but there is not a lot of seating. Take out is always an option though! This is a great place to eat & get a not so ordinary meal."}
{"text":"please open in raleigh!!! miss you guys. so delish."}
{"text":"i am glad to have some healthy options in the area!  Please never leave Elizabeth! I know the location gets busy, but it's really the best option in the area for unique, fresh food! Their caesar salad with pulled chicken is SO GOOD.   I don't know what the heck that yellow sauce is either, but I love it!"}
{"text":"The quality went way down ! I went in several weeks ago expecting the usual tantalizing sauces, perfect flavors in bean side dish and perfect rice (I get the quarter chicken meal with cilantro rice and bean sides) - I was soo disappointed! 

Trust me I know how it should taste like since I used to frequent them(this location and near uptown) on my lunch breaks. The sauces were completely off :( no tangy kick only super salty green sauce. . No creamy goodness -I couldn't even eat the yellow sauce. The chicken piece seemed more fatty , the rice had bigger pieces of carrot and seemed off in flavor as well. Beans were definitely lacking!
 This was one of the biggest disappointment . I guess I will see if the Elizabeth location is still good. You don't understand how addicted I was to this plate/food/sauces. Maybe they are expanding too rapidly with many locations and aren't doing enough quality control ?? :("}
{"text":"The perfect lunch spot for a paleo meal. In the heart of Elizabeth, this place has amazing vibe and delicious food to match. I got the quarter chicken with plantains and house salad. My only regret is not ordering a lager piece of chicken. It was moist and had tons of flavor. Best part is that it came with two types of dipping sauce that complimented the chicken well. Though the plantains had to be the star. Next time I need to try the stuffed avocados and yuka. Great find!"}
{"text":"I've pretty much tried everything on the menu and I've enjoyed everything...The Elizabeth location is probably my favorite. I come here every chance I get. The stuffed avocado is a classic...with a side of canary beans and sweet plantains."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We ordered Quinoa Stuffed Avocados as an appetizer, they came 2 in an order with chicken on top on a bed of lettuce. I ate 2 by myself and felt pretty full. We also ordered 1/4 white chicken with rice and beans. The chicken was moist and flavorful. For drinks, we had passion fruit juice which was perfect for summer time. If you are in Charlotte, you should definitely make a trip to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great first experience. Went for first time on a Sunday afternoon. My wife, our four year old, and I split a whole chicken with green beans, sweet plantains and sweet potato fries. We had plenty of food, it was all great, and we also liked the three sauces that came with the meal. The staff checked on us multiple times, refilled our waters and were just very pleasant and grateful. All this while they were very busy and for a very reasonable $22. Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"This is just one of those times where you just know that the food is gonna be real good. After getting in the small door I sampled the three different juices and homemade drinks they have to order. The orange one with passion fruit tasted wonderful on my lips. I then proceeded to order the 1/4 dark meat rotisserie style chicken as the dark meat is always going to be juicer and more flavorful then the white meat. Anyways my two sides were yucca fries and canary beans which are similar to pinto beans and the way they are cooked is almost the same. As we were dinning several different staff members stopped by to see how we liked the food and to clear the empty plates. So another fantastic lunch in Charlotte for me today. Do your self a favor and take some of the cookies they have for sale they kicked ass."}
{"text":"Parking for Viva Chicken was a super hassle. Ugh, I didn't have any coins for the meter and then I had to install some app on my phone and then create an account and the whole time I'm hoping a meter maid doesn't come by.

Okay, enough unrelated nonsense. Viva Chicken is right across the way from the Presbyterian Hospital's main lobby entrance. Inside dining and outside on their small patio. Order at the register and pay, get your drink filled and then your food's brought to you a bit later.

I chose \"The Great\" sandwich - a good portion of pulled chicken with the usual lettuce and tomato on a toasted ciabatta roll. It was excellent. The chicken was nice and moist with a good flavor. For my side, I chose the sweet plaintains which were perfect. Plump and juicy and really flavorful.

A great sandwich, I'll hope to be back here again!"}
{"text":"First time trying today - it was very tasty. I had the inca wrap with chicken. Huge wrap - couldn't eat all at one time with sweet potato fries. I will return to try other food items.  The sauces are amazing as well."}
{"text":"I had the Viva Chicken Salad with romaine/spring mix/pulled rotisserie chicken/avocado/red onions/feta/tomato/cucumber and house balsamic.  The salad was all that I expected and more.  They will prepare it to your specifications.  When I visit the new Huntersville location, I will have them omit the red onions.  Otherwise, the visit was great, service and was excellent.  They stayed pretty busy with the customers in the restaurant and those coming/going with to go orders.  I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"So I love Viva Chicken but it was my first time at this location since I was in the area. The set up was perfect walking in because they have two lines one for pick up and one for ordering/dining in, and you just go straight to the line. The line was short but went quick with the two cashiers working during lunch time. I ordered my usual the Inca warp with chicken and decided to try out the green beans, that was a great choice because they was cooked perfectly. I received a number to wait for my food. As I waited I ran to the restroom which was very clean and you can tell they keep it up. Then I went to the sauce bar and got sauces. They have red (hot), green (medium), and yellow (mild). I get all there but I like yellow the best best of the flavor and I like the kick in the red. I probably sat down for a quick second and my food was ready!"}
{"text":"My \"go to\" place.  The food is excellent, sangria is tasty and service is great.  I'm never disappointed.  I  Viva Chicken! I hope they plan to build more locations."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Viva Chicken on Elizabeth. This place is usually hoppin', and there's no doubt as to why.

Food: Viva is a quick service, rotisserie chicken restaurant serving up Peruvian inspired dishes. I always get the 1/4 chicken (all white meat) with sides of cilantro rice and plantains. Their plantains are phenomenal -- great flavor and a little bit of crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. They have a selection of dipping sauces -- I prefer the green sauce, which is medium spicy. They made an herbal lemonade that I highly recommend if you like basil. 

Service: Service here is usually great! They are quick to get people through the line at the register, which can sometimes seem daunting. Once you order, you can take a seat and someone will bring your food out. They also bus tables if it looks like you're wrapping up.

Parking: Elizabeth has its own free parking lot and it's across the street from Viva Chicken. 

I highly recommend Viva!"}
{"text":"I don't give my highest honors out recklessly. Viva chicken in my experience consistently delivers poultry (almost) perfection. The location in the heart of the trendy Elizabeth neighborhood is my personal favorite. 

The interior is understated, with lots of tans, Brown's and wood, and muted oranges. Large front of house windows provide plenty of natural light, affording in the light casual atmosphere. The whole ambience says, \"we let our chicken do the talking for us\".

Bonus points for the approximately 458 outlets dotted along the indie dining room. They clearly recognize their proximity to the CPCC campus. Plus the convenience of the outlets is a God-send for Yelp reviewers who burned up their battery playing Pokémon Go, erm, not that I'd know anything about that...

My go to order is the half chicken with 2 sides. I can vouch for the yuca fries and the quinoa from my pre-low-carb life. I can also vouch for their arroz con pollo dish. The green beans are also bae.

Bonus for any Pokémon Go players: there is a Poké stop literally right outside the entrance! Pick a table near front of house if you're dining in, drop a lure, and catch 'em all while you eat!"}
{"text":"I love Viva Chicken and will strive to create a at-home version of their chicken and rice soup, but until such perfection can be achieved, I'll have to continue to get my fix at the Viva!

My husband and I really enjoy Viva chicken and are excited about the Ballentyne location as well. It's a great place for some pretty delicious and for the most part, healthy food. 

Go with the Chicken, the Viva Salad is not impressive - so go big with a chicken!
For sides I recommend the Yuka or the rice and chicken soup.
The side salads are great too, I love the dressing. 

This location gets packed pretty quick around lunch so be prepared or come early."}
{"text":"I've been really looking forward to trying this place since I pass it every day and like everyone else in Charlotte (random,no?) I love Peruvian food! Gotta say after stopping in I'm stoked. I will first say that the Hey, Causita is pretty on point - it's one of my favorite dishes & theirs is really good. Also, the herbed basil lemonade is the jam. The taste of the sauce was very slightly lacking in authenticity but I will attribute this to the location smack in the center of yup-ville. The employees didn't seem to care very much about.. Anything. But I got my food to go and it was really delicious, so I don't really care. I wouldn't, however, suggest going here at a busy eating time."}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic Peruvian with perfectly cooked and spices chicken. The green beans were amazing and very flavorful, lots of ginger and a touch of sweetness. The sauces are all so tasty and not as spicy as they claim (but I like spice). Didn't love the fruit side, but that was my fault for ordering a fruit cup! Sweet potato fries were also delicious. Very crowded during lunch but still remarkably fast and reasonably priced. I'll be there again!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong the food is good a have been in this place 2 times . The reasons for only 3 star the music is annoying and too Loud the place is busy we can not enjoy a conversation in this place."}
{"text":"Today we try rotisserie chicken delicious ! The service is pleasant and attentive from the person who greets you to the one who takes your order to the table. It was a great experience .Also good price s"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout lunch from Viva Chicken the other day and were so impressed! What great menu items! I'm looking forward to trying the quinoa stuffed avocados sometime, the Yelp pictures make it look amazing! We ordered the arroz chufa with a side chicken and rice soup and The Great sandwich with all white meat (its $2 to add chicken and 75 cents to add only white meat), they gave us a 20 minute wait. It was packed when we went in for pick up but thats ok, that means the food is good. I was surprised by the size and weight of the takeout containers, pretty big actually. The arroz chufa is a Asian Peruvian fusion fried rice, and it was delicious. I loved the addition of bell peppers and Peruvian soy sauce. This is definitely enough to share too. The Great was also an amazing sandwich, fresh and substantial. You can definitely order just the sandwich for lunch and be satisfied. Though not authentic, I love the ciabatta bread that was used. They used a generous amount of chicken as well. The side soup was great! Had big, flavorful chunks of chicken. 

But my favorite part, has to be the sauce bar! My favorite, the green sauce! I can put that sh*t on everything! The cilantro and jalapeno really shine here. I actually think its more spicy compared to the hot red sauce. YUM. Will for sure be back for more!"}
{"text":"Dear Chipotle,

It's not you; it's me. I met someone else. And, despite my initial fears, Viva Chicken has become the love of my life.

I thought that a place with \"Chicken\" in the name would have paltry fare for a vegetarian like me. Boy was I wrong. I've had the amazing Quinoa Stuffed Avocado that is surprisingly filling and flavorful. I don't regret trying it, but it didn't send me down this path.

My heart belongs to the Tacu Bowl. Now, Chipotle, I know you're trying really hard, but your vegetarian burrito bowl doesn't hold a candle to the Tacu Bowl at Viva Chicken. And that's why I'm calling it off.

The Tacu Bowl has perfectly executed rice, flavorful beans, a generous smattering of cilantro, and some amazing onion/tomato mixture to top it off that leaves my mouth watering more after every bite. Add a little of the Huacatay Sauce and there's almost nothing better in the world.

Speaking of reasons why my affections have shifted...the fried yucca. Oh so amazing. And I've eaten my share of uninspiring fried yucca. This yucca makes all my dreams come true. Dipped in the Aji Amarillo Sauce and Huacatay Sauce, it changed my life and expectations of food.

I know it's not fair to compare you two, and I hate to tell you in this way...but I'm moving in with Viva Chicken. Tomorrow.

We can still be friends, right?"}
{"text":"Tried out Viva Chicken for lunch (due to hearing from several people how good it was). The Elizabeth location was poppin'! We were helped at the register right away. There was a gentleman helping direct customers and giving them menus. The menu looked great with lots of tasty and healthy options and they had really cool house made drinks (I did not get one of them though). Full house but seats opened quickly. Our food came out quickly too!
 I got a rice dish that had egg, chicken, and ginger in it. I could have used more of the sauce they cooked my dish in as the chicken was actually a bit dry, but still tasty. My husband got a different dish with cilantro rice, chicken and beans with pickled onions and avocado, it was good!
They have a really tight set-up, as in not a lot of room. Their house made sauce station (killer sauces!) is squeezed in next to their drink machine in the corner so there is a line that backs up and blocks the main walking area, not a good idea.
I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday, eat something different each time, and still be completely satisfied. This place never fails to deliver high quality food and great service. The green sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"Viva ...LOVE. I love the stuffed avocados, sweet potatoes (actually all of the sides), but most importantly the sauces. I put that stuff on EVERYTHING ( which maybe isn't proper but it is so darn good!). If you are looking for something quick and delicious I highly suggest viva chicken. My only qualm is that the prices continually go up (which I understand to some degree is outside of their control) so what would have been $ is now $$."}
{"text":"Always on point! I always call my order in because they are ALWAYS busy, which shows how amazing they are. My food is usually ready in 10-15 mins, which is fine because that's how long I have to drive to pick up. Their in-store made salsas (green and red, especially) are phenomenal, I always have to stock up when I go. It is so delicious, can't say enough about that! Also, this location has always been ultra friendly when I call and when I pick up. LOVE them, always my go-to."}
{"text":"This place is the best! I've never had anything on the menu that I didn't love.  The staff are friendly and the place is always clean and well kept! I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, quick service, and great location. Just try it."}
{"text":"Good food, quick service, well organized.  New location at concord. Was very busy. Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"My life is  made.

I love Spanish food---every kind---and this place didn't disappoint.

I ordered the pollo a la brasa with cilantro rice and platanos maduros. The chicken was  so tasty and everything was delicious but...
Oh.
My.
God.

The green sauce. Tasted like a Cilantro, garlicky spicy just right thing. It was heaven. I stole my boyfriends and took it home.

And the passion fruit tea was ridic.

We will def be back."}
{"text":"Loved the roasted Chicken. And the sides were pretty good too. I ate too much! Next time I'm in Charlotte, I will pay it another visit."}
{"text":"Arrived with a large group right at noon, we found seats and got our food quickly which is rare with a party of 15. The great wrap is delicious as well as the stuffed avocado. I would recommend the corn salad for your side. New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We went for lunch on a Sunday and it was super busy.  Tables were turning fast so we didn't have any issues finding a table.  I had the Inca wrap and my husband has the fried rice with chicken.   Both were very tasty and the jasmine rice was cooked perfectly.  Definitely see why the good reviews. Will be back for sure soon!"}
{"text":"Food is usually great, management and customer service is TERRIBLE!!!!  First, I paid for my order on-line, then they made me pay for my order again when I went to pick-up my food.  Then they had the nerve to call me at home after 10:00 PM to try to tell me that my credit card had been declined when I have a receipt in my hand.  Get your crap together Viva and quit harassing your loyal customers!  Chicken was under-cooked and tough this time as well."}
{"text":"Solid rotisserie chicken and dipping sauces.  I did not try anything else, but I think if you are ordering from a place with 'chicken' in the title, it is fair to judge them on their chicken.  

The food was good and the prices hovered around the acceptable range($12 for a chicken), but nothing remarkable here.  In the future, I think I would just hit up Teeter for a rotisserie chicken and a bottle of honey mustard."}
{"text":"YAAAASSS!! This place is the absolute BEST!!

Delicious, every food item. (Not so much on the funky combo drinks). Service is quick and efficient - including the ability to order online ahead. The sauces are FREE!! Get the green one, put it on everything, its AMAZING! 

Best tip about this place: There is a small patio!

Sad tip about this place: They close by 9PM :("}
{"text":"I picked up take out here last week and it was amazing! They didn't take too long getting it ready and there weren't too many people in the restaurant. I tried the Tacu Bowl with chicken and it was such a massive amount of food! Lasted for two meals. The chicken was so tender; and the rest of the dish added a ton of flavor that I didn't need any sauce on it. My boyfriend got the stuffed quinoa avocados with chicken and that was amazing. They looked awesome. The sweet plantains were perfectly cooked and there were plenty to share between the two of us. This is definitely a place we will come back to visit!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints ! This is my go to place when I am craving some Hispanic food.
Maduros , infused rice and 1/2 chicken is my
Plate of choice !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The quinoa stuffed avocado salad was amazing - packed with many favors and healthy! Go with the special Peruvian chicken.  This place has great and quick service and reasonable!  It's a must try!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location since it opened! 

Viva Chicken is one of my top recommended spots for a fresh, delicious, healthy meal in Charlotte. You can tell the owners and managers have a passion for great customer service! 

While I've had many of the menu items, I always come back to the rotisserie chicken. After all, its called Viva 'Chicken'. Salads, rice dishes, wraps - it's all good. Whatever you get, make sure you get some of their great sauces!"}
{"text":"I love Viva Chicken! The food is fantastic, the people are nice and accommodating, the location could not be easier to get to. 

But the music?

The music at the this location is HORRIBLE! Whoever picked this music for your casual dining pleasure should be fired and run out of town. Loud, abusive, with a driving beat that WILL NOT allow you to enjoy your meal or the friends you are there with. It's invasive and raises both your anxiety level and your blood pressure.

Makes you want to either rip your ears off so you don't have to be subjected to that raucousness or to take you food to go.

Looks like the Johnson Road location will now be our go to. Too bad. It's in such a great location and in the middle of a lifestyle center that will thrive and grow. Won't be long before it's replaced by another restaurant at this rate. (Or they'll get rid of the manager who was in the building the entire time we were there.)

And did I mention that the choice of music and volume is horrible?"}
{"text":"Solid rotisserie chicken spot, for a decent price."}
{"text":"Very good food. The rotisserie chicken is juicy and comes in the perfect portion.... And an economical alternative to pio pio. The sides are great. Sweet plantains, yucca, and cilantro rice are my faves. The pork sandwich is also dynamite. Parking has never been an issue for me."}
{"text":"Quinoa chicken avacodo is so flippin good. I am here on business and I am eating this again before I go."}
{"text":"A pretty decent Peruvian chicken place.  The green sauce is pretty good.  The yucca and the plantains were both very good.  Skip the fries.  The chicken was pretty decent.  

Service was excellent.  My husband told me he felt like they must have just opened since they were very friendly.  I don't know if that is the case or not but I reminded him we were in the south and people are much more friendlier than they are in the DC area."}
{"text":"I was already a Viva Chicken fan so I'm elated that they opened this location near my home. I took my rather picky husband tonight to introduce him and he absolutely loved the chicken. I'm a vegetarian and I think a lot of people would be surprised that a large majority of the menu is actually veggie! Plus the menu is marked making it super easy. Any place that can satisfy both our extreme tastes gets 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love Viva Chicken! You can't go wrong with any of the options but my favorite is the Stuffed Quinoa Salad!"}
{"text":"Oh Viva, sweet sweet Viva. I highly recommend anything on their menu. I usually go for the Viva Salad with chicken or a full quinoa-stuffed avocado. And to make sure I'm not being too healthy, sometimes I'll get a side of fries (which is HUGE, definitely shareable) and dip in all of the sauces.  

You can't go wrong getting a whole chicken and three sides. For two people, this ends up being at least 2-3 meals; the cilantro rice and canary beans never seem to end! It's probably the best value here. I also can't help but mention their \"arroz chaufa\" aka fried rice. One serving is easily 2 meals and has a ton of flavor. 

This new location is much easier to park and find a seat than Elizabeth, and much more convenient when living in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Super excited for this Concord location. They don't have Yuca, but since it's a brand spanking new opening, they get a pass! 

Viva Las Vegas! Viva el pollo! Viva Chicken!"}
{"text":"I love this place, great Peruvian cuisines for adorable prices. I especially love the herbal juices that are made in house. Ask them for a sample of each juice to see which one you like best. I always leave full, but not too full - food portions are great!"}
{"text":"Really really delicious place! I had a Naked Peruvian chicken wrap and it was amazing! Everything was so fresh and had so much flavor: quinoa, big pieces of avocado, feta cheese mmmmmmm I had a bean soup on a side and it was great too - cilantro made it taste so good. Staff was super friendly: refilled water, and asked us a couple of times if everything was ok. The only thing I don't understand why they had electronic music playing lol"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with viva chicken. I always get the same thing, dark meat chicken, cilantro like rice, plantains, and every sauce. You really can't go wrong with this place. The tres leches cake is also a must have and to die for."}
{"text":"Wife and I went there for the first time today. The chicken was AWESOME !!!  Service was great.  Love this place."}
{"text":"This place is nothing but hype.  My wife and I tried lunch here recently, and other than a few interesting sauces, it has to rank as the most overpriced chicken dinner I've ever eaten.  Two chicken dinners for $27 sets a new record of obscene pricing.  

A much better chicken dinner is available just around the corner at the Roasting Company at much more down to earth pricing.  They have a larger selection of entrees and sides too.

The food isn't bad, but it isn't spectacular either, at least to the extent they charge for it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to Viva for a weeknight dinner. Everything we ordered was excellent! Yet, I have to say... the \"green sauce\" surely was the star of the show! My husband loved the plantain's and the \"hot\" sauces. 
I really enjoyed the passion fruit drink they serve, along with the spice's used on my dish. Beautiful balance and so flavorful! 
The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. Super clean, nice outdoor seating area, and many options to choose from the menu. 
Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! This is probably my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I've gone now many times, and I've never been disappointed. They are very consistent, and I've never not liked anything I've tried here. The food is very flavorful, and very affordable. I recommend their herbal lemonade, and covering everything in their yellow sauce. I could drink that stuff."}
{"text":"Omgosh this place is amazing!!  I got the 1/4 chicken and it was so tender and juicy and the flavor was great!  I also got the Viva Chicken Salad with the homemade balsamic which was amazing!  The salad was super fresh and I'm usually not a fan of balsamic dressing but this was sweet and thick more like a glaze.  The cilantro rice is so so good.  I also tried the yucca which I had never heard of.  I thought they were french fries at first but the consistency is a little different and they are a little sweeter than a potato.  I just don't have a bad word to say about this place.  Everything is beyond fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Viva Chicken?! Welp nine times out of 10 if someone asks me what I want to eat...I'll answer \"umm let's have VIVA\"!!! This place is awesome!!! I've had the half chicken with the chicken soup and the cilantro rice. I've had the yuca fries, regular fries, house salad, bean soup,fried rice... omg I can go on and on! The sauces are awesome although I've only had the mild and medium (yellow & green) sauces. I put that $hIt on everything! I've started mixing the yellow and green sauce together to make a perfect sauce. Anyhoots try it you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place is heaven. I wanted to post a picture but it smelled so good I had to take a bite, then it tasted so good by the time I finished there was nothing left for a picture. The food has a little kick (spice) to it, but not too much. And i'm someone who doesn't like spicy food. Everything is so flavorful. Together with a coworker, we ordered the Peruvian Chicken, Green Beans, Sweet Potato Fries and House Salad. Being it was during the lunch rush, I ordered online. It said it would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived a few minutes early and went to the designated pick up line and my food was bagged and ready. The place was really busy. They only serve one dressing, thats balsamic, which my coworker said was the best she's had and it tasted like it was homemade. Hands down those green beans were the best i've had from a restaurant. The Sweet potato fries were decent. Not crunchy. But I assume its because of the sealed take out boxes they were in. I still ate every last one. But the chicken!! Ohhh that chicken!! Soooo flavorful! I dont know how else to describe it. Loved the prices. The 1/4 chicken meal was 8.50 and the 1/2 was 12.50. I literally can't wait to go back. I already know what I will be trying next!!"}
{"text":"I've been a bit obsessed with Viva Chicken for the past couple of weeks.  One:  super convenient, fast-casual dining and Two:  their offerings are very tasty and amazing.

A lot of my patronage here has been through Postmates (due to the crazy holiday schedule), but having this Elizabeth location is super convenient to Uptown, PlazaMidwood, and Southend.  I highly recommend it and usually if I'm in a quandary of where to take folks for dinner, Viva Chicken always is in my wheelhouse arsenal due to it's flavors as well as vegetarian/gluten options as well.

I'm a big fan of the Inca Wrap and the Yuca fries.  OMG - ALL the sauces are pretty amazing and they do not shy away from spice (beware).  Probably my most favorite is the green (Aji) packed full of jalapenos and cilantro.  1/4 chicken is usually enough for one person and you get two sides!

The one ding I will give the Elizabeth location is parking, but.. hey Postmates?"}
{"text":"Every time I think of Viva Chicken, my mouth starts watering.  I had some out of town visitors and couldn't figure out where to take them... but Viva Chicken is definitely a must stop place.  I've had reservations with the Elizabeth location (mostly parking), but this new location has a huge parking lot.  Still busy as always, but seems to be a flow and keeps people coming back for more.

We had the quinoa stuffed avocados and I ordered a BLT wrap which was excellent with a side of plantains.  We also ordered yucca and got #allthesauces for dipping and pouring and enjoying.

The staff are super friendly.... and PATIENT.  I know you walk in and order, but my family wasn't quiet ready so we stepped back and found the handy menus located on the half-wall to peruse.  

Even though there's a lot of people coming through here, the place is super clean and the staff also come by to pick up your plates when you are done eating.  Probably just as easy to clean up after yourself since there are trash receptacles located in convenient spots.  You do get a little \"herded\", like cattle to make your way to the registers to place an order, but everything else was super easy and relaxed."}
{"text":"After reading all the other reviews on Viva, I was a bit skeptical.  How could anyone top my favorite Peruvian place but they did it.  

The format here is a bit different than the other Peruvian places.  It's a fast casual format where you order at the counter, they give you a number and then they bring out your food.  I honestly think some of the other Peruvian places around town would do better if they switched to this format.

So what's to try at a Peruvian place to compare it to other places?  The rotisserie chicken, of course!  I ordered the half chicken with plantains and fries.  The chicken was amazing.  I could taste the seasonings and the chicken was very moist.   The plantains were great as well and the fries were the best I've had at a Peruvian restaurant.   And those sauces.  Sometimes that's the best part...dipping your chicken (and fries) in the yellow and green sauces.  Yum.

I love the decor of the place.  It reminds me of Crisp in Dilworth.  They also have a nice patio which is shielded from the neighboring parking lot with rows of plants.  

The staff is very friendly here.  They kept coming around to ask if everything was ok or if you needed a drink refill.  Also, most of the paper/plastic products are compostable so they are quite environmentally conscious here.  

The only things I didn't care for here are their choice in music...it was very club-ish.  Also the plastic fork didn't do well with handling the chicken."}
{"text":"\"The Great\" is great. (has anyone said that yet?)

Cilantro-infused rice- not so great. (just decent)

Sweet potato fries- LORD YES. So good. I have a life's mission of making excellent sweet potato fries at home and I feel like these fueled the fire within. They're good. 

And the green sauce? Yeah, I'd drink that."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! I hope it makes its way  up to Jersey soon.

I came here two days in a row for lunch ...it was that good. From the delicious chicken to the fresh avocado to the variety of sauce options this place has something for everyone. I would highly recommend their Naked Peruvian wrap as well as their quinoa stuffed avocado.

The staff is great always very friendly always there to provide a helping hand or clean things up!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great food, nice vibe, very clean, unique flavors. Definitely a multiple repeat place."}
{"text":"With Chicken in the name, you know it is all about the Chicken here. But it's about the chicken and the bag of chips. 

The yucca fries are amazing. Must get the cheese sauce on the side, even if you don't order the appetizer side that comes with it.

I am not normally a fan of sirloin steak but here it is done right. It is properly seasoned and so tender and delectable. It pairs well on a sandwich with ciabatta bread.

The chicken whether you get white or dark is going to be flavorful and moist. The skin is the best part but the skin is ALWAYS the best part.

This place is crowded. I mean crowded. I have never physically sat here to eat because I can't be bothered with the crowd and waiting for a table. The first time I placed our order to go without calling it in and I learned quickly that calling it in is hands down the best way to go. If you are going to take your order to go, calling it in is the ONLY way to go.

Skip the yellow sauce. Go directly to red and green. And I know it says their red sauce is really spicy but it is NOT hot but very flavorful. I almost always purchase a bottle of the green and red sauce every time and I use it on everything. I mean everything."}
{"text":"Amazing. I've literally had everything on the menu and everything is great. The food is perfectly seasoned, well composed & authentic. The different sauces are so delicious and each has a very different flavor/level of heat to them. My favorite dish is the classic saltado, which is well worth the money and ends up being 3 meals worth of food. 

You can get so much bang for your buck here. Ordering the whole chicken meal with the 3 large sides is a must! The quinoa, chicken soup & green beans are the best! Perfect post workout meal that's fresh, good for you and delicious. You really can't go wrong with anything you choose. 

Try some of the drinks and desserts. Really friendly staff, very attentive. Great location. Amazing concept. Charlotte needed it for sure."}
{"text":"I never leave Charlotte without hitting up Viva Chicken!  The chicken is succulent, the yucca is magical and the plantains are like candy!  I want to open one in Chicago!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for the family. Delicious! Thank you for coming to Concord! We needed a place like this."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with this place. I always get the Naked Peruvian wrap, either vegetarian or chicken, with a side of cilantro rice. I literally crave it the next day. It's one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Once you try Viva Chicken, you won't look at rotisserie chicken the same way.  Fast-casual sit down spot with several locations in Charlotte.  Flavorful juicy Peruvian-style chicken, awesome sides, and vegetarian friendly options.  My go to is 1/2 chicken with yucca and plantains.  Try the three sauces (yellow green red).  Great value and consistent quality!"}
{"text":"Amazing ! It was my first time and the service was fast and the serving was great. I got the limena chopped salad which was amazing was filled with multiple flavors and ingredients that complimented each other. The pulled chicken was great and the yellow and green sauces were heavenlyyyyyyyyy! This is a place everyone should try!"}
{"text":"When Peruvian is offered during lunch, let this be the first place that comes to mind! I'm not sure how long this location has been here but I'm ever so grateful, because it gives me delight being so close to my job. 

If you want to avoid the lunchtime rush, then it's best to get there around 11:50-ish but no later than 12:10! The line was to the back door and in the beginning stages of wrapping around to the sauce bar! The cashiers were quick and friendly, so you will not be in line for too long. 

The food is AMAZING! Most believe that you can't go wrong with chicken, but you can and this place DOES NOT! The 1/4 chicken lunch special is enough to hold you over so you don't suffer from a food coma so early in the day.... however, I didn't take my own advice and enjoyed a 1/2 chicken with two sides (lol), lazy is now an understatement. 

Check this place out, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"I really liked this food.. I have been to a few different Peruvian food places and they all had the same taste in flavor and spices. But this places is by far the best. Maybe it's the rotisserie or the variety of other meal options or maybe THE SAUCE!!! But I could eat this everyday. 

I ordered the 1/2 rotisserie, which was amazing and put the orange sauce on my rice. My mom ordered the stuff avocado, which she finished in minutes. And my 7yr old daughter loved the rice.

One thing we did wrong was go during lunch time, which is really for the busy professional. 

Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"I ordered a quarter chicken with rice and green beans. The chicken was good, but not really any better than your average grocery store rotisserie chicken. I thought the green dip was gross, but the yellow was pretty good. 
Rice was nice and fresh, the green beans were not so fresh. 
The food took pretty long to get and parking really sucks. There is parking behind the building, I was just unfortunate enough to make my way there just as a thunderstorm was rolling in. 
However, I would probably go to one again. There are so few healthy options for a take out lunch and this fit the bill."}
{"text":"The chicken is always tender and never dry. The various dishes are full of flavor and I love the sauces. The different drinks they offer are good too"}
{"text":"The food was really good, if a bit expensive for quick service, and the restaurant was loud.  Will probably go back."}
{"text":"I have only been to this location and the Elizabeth location because I work close to Elizabeth. The employees at this location have always been friendly and helpful.  We eat Viva Chicken a lot and now usually get  1/4 white chicken kids meal and cilantro lime rice or green beans with an herbal limeade. I get too full and waste when  ordering the adult meal. I know there are more things on the menu that I have heard great things about and will venture out one day:)"}
{"text":"So good my wife and i love the sides especially.... thanks for those green beans !!!! Yummmmm. Quinoa anyone...oh hell yah"}
