{"text":"This place is terrible, service was not good at all we had a group of 9 and two guys did not choose to eat, when they said they did not want anything. Our waitress would not fill up their water. She was rude and kept saying I better get a good tip, because we were asking her simple commands.. She rudely corrected my Spanish and said that I was wrong. Do not go there!"}
{"text":"I really haven't had anything bad from here.  The burritos are really good and so is the salsa.  Great service too."}
{"text":"This business just changed owners.  It was not good before but it is worse now.  The food was NOT GOOD and the new manager was not helpful at all.  We asked her a questions about something that was on the menu and she told us to ask our waitress.  Not friendly at all.  Go to the Mexican restaurant on the square - it is a much better experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here while he was working in Monticello and it was a pleasant surprise!  He's heard nothing but good things, so we had to try it!  Everyone was very friendly and service was fast.  The food was very good and the prices low."}
{"text":"This is Casa Real. It exists at the same address as two Mexican restaurants before it. It is owned by different folks. The food is excellent and the service is, as well. Their sauces are seasoned very well, and their meats are marinated in such a way as to make excellently flavored dishes of all types. They have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages including Mexican and American beers, many wines, and all types of mixed drinks. They have many Margarita flavors including chocolate and watermelon besides the more traditional strawberry, mango, etc. The service is fast and friendly. The prices are very reasonable. We will be going back often."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. Service is always quick and friendly, food is served in generous portions, and you're not going to empty your wallet by eating here. It's not the most authentic out there, but hey, it's a solid choice for dining out in Monticello. Plus, what's not to love about a place that recognizes who you are based on your to-go order?"}
