{"text":"first off I come all the way from Richmond Hill and it's nice to see a Filipino take out place other than the one across the street. 
I have read the review from earlier on and I believe it does not give justice to what it truly is. 

1. You have to consider that it is INSIDE THE mall, meaning the price usually revolves around the competition,  such as Asian gourmet,  Jimmy the Greek or any other take out place.  So I believe that their price is reasonable in terms of competition within the area. 

2. The food is way better than the foods around the area because first off they are actually made in their kitchen. You can literally see them putting it out as steaming hot (that's when you know it was made as a fresh batch and not something that was precooked and warmed up). 

3. Their Halo halo is called a shaved ice dessert.  So in reality it has to have more shaved ice for it to melt. It was not too sweet like any other I have tasted which is good because it is not over powering the taste of the other ingredients. The price is also reasonable for its size and contents. 


lastly, it is a take out place that's why I commend the servers that took my order for their amazing customer service skills, even though it was busy, they had a lot going and some customers were rude they were still cheerful and acknowledged each and every customer that came in with a smile. 
I will definitely come by and visit again, for that amazing sago't gulaman and Shanghai rolls."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I've ever had with Filipino food. Here's why I'm disappointed:

- there are no variety of food available. The picture being displayed on their menu looks more appetizing than the actual food. Why is there no Kare Kare when you're showing a display picture of Kare Kare???
- they said their halo halo is good. Sorry but 90% of it is made out of ice. Small scoop of ice cream and may be a tablespoon of the other mix of whatever they are. And not enough evaporated milk. Really????
- ordered their combo - Hub number 2.  The menu says rice plus any two items...but then the items were limited and some items were not included as part of the hub combo...well isn't that very misleading?

Overall, one combo is worth $7. 50...almost $8. Not enough dishes to go with the rice. Like literally probably 1/4 cup per dish. You expect me to pay $8 for that????
And another shock is that the skewer costs $2. 50 each???? Are you kidding me???

I will never go here again! Yes, the servers are friendly and they are quick with the orders...but if the food is expensive and not great, what's the point??? We want the best of both worlds when it comes to fast food. 

It comes down to great service and great savings.

P.S
My mom can make these dishes...and she'd fill my plate with so much food. If you're Filipino, you known this is the truth. So why not consider the fact that we like a lot of good food at affordable prices???"}
{"text":"Good place for fast Filipino food! It pretty good if you're in a pinch and want a quick bite. I wouldn't go to this place over Kabalen or Sampaguita or FV foods. But I wouldn't be upset eating here when I'm craving some caldereta."}
{"text":"The combo prices are reasonable considering nabbing a location at Centrepoint mall.
This isn't Yorkdale or even close to nearby mall like Promenade but this is probably my first encounter with Filipino anything landing a spot in a mall. 

It's not quite where all the other fast food chains are in the food court, but sharing an area code right by the entrance gives this place opening advantage.


Filipino cuisine is notorious for either high prices and poor quality but this place steers clear from these stereotypical expectations.

I give their 'toron' (banana plantain wrapped and fried) all the stars for this review! Pricey at $1.50 though, but with Timmy's right across, it sure beats pairing your coffee with another boring doughnut.

The veggie roll (lumpyang gulay) was ok, a bit soggy and their vinegar sauce needs more salt, higher on the sour level and needs more seasoning to balance the acidity. The tortang talong was very tasty and the balance between the egg and eggplant was spot on! 

The only downside was that the sisig couldn't be included in the combo, service wasn't bad but wasn't memorable either. I gather this place would be 'Sunday after church central' considering St Pascal is across from centre point mall and a walking distance to Manila Manila."}
{"text":"Love their pork bbq and pancit palabok. Will definitely go back just for these two. Dinuguan is okay. Servers are very friendly."}
