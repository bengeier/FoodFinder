{"text":"The Falafel King has been a staple in downtown Calgary since 1994, and offers the best Middle Eastern cuisine around. Walk into their restaurant on Stephen Avenue and you'll see a nicely decorated hall - surprisingly classy if you ask me. All around, people were happily stuffing their faces while attempting to prevent the \"Shwarma Drip\" from hitting their clothes, and there was a whole line of customers at the counter eager to join in on the fun. The friendly staff are kind enough to ask if you want their fiery hot sauce on your pita, which I asked for just a little bit but I could've handled more heat. Then they stuff a pita the size of a large Frisbee with either falafel (chick pea mash) or shwarma (slow-roasted chicken or beef), and tons of brightly coloured veggies. I got the chicken shwarma ($9.00), and I'm not kidding - this thing was a foot long and half a foot wide. With every bite you discover a new flavour hidden in there, from the fresh parsley to the pink cabbage slaw to their famous garlic sauce, not to mention the juicy chicken. I'll admit, I'm not a fan of dark meat poultry and there was a fair amount in there, but I barely noticed once I started eating. The best part? All their food is naturally low in calories and fat, which I know many of my lady friends appreciate. 
The highlight of the meal, though, was the free baby piece of baklava they provide with each sandwich purchased. It was flaky, gooey, and delicious, and helped mask my rampant garlic breath from the shwarma. Normally baklava is not my thing - I find the spices and nuts overwhelming - but this one only had pistachios lightly sprinkled on the outside and very little spice, so it was perfection in my eyes. 
The Falafel King offers dine in or take out, and they also have an extensive juice/milkshake menu if you're only in the mood for a cool beverage."}
{"text":"After moving to Calgary, I came here for a late lunch on my second day with my friend, who suggested this place.

The place only had two other diners at 3pm.  We each ordered the beef sharwarma platter to dine in.  The Middle-Eastern lady was all smiles as we were ordering and even threw in a bite of baklava on-the-house for each of us.  I paid for the meals and her face turned to stone when she noticed I didn't add in a tip on the card-reader.  To be honest, I must have missed the tip option on the machine as I was dead-tired.  I was thinking to throw in a toonie into the tip-jar but as soon as I saw her reaction I decided not to.

We sat down and ate our meals.

Reasonable portion and nice selection of sides: pickles, cabbage, a chunk of tomato, garlic sauce.  I can't comment on the falafel as I haven't eaten many in my life.

However, the main items of the platter were just ok: the beef was not juicy and tender and didn't have much flavor.  The rice was flavorless and the pita a little dry.

She didn't offer us any water to drink when we told her we didn't want to buy anything to drink.

She didn't ask us how our meal was at any point either.

In total, at $13.50 per platter, it's expensive for what it is - a plate of sharwarma food, that in other cities may cost $8-11 with similar or better quality.

When we left we said goodbye - she was talking on her phone and didn't acknowledge us.

OK...I guess we won't be going back.  At least I won't.  And I wanted to try the donair at one point as well (I've lived in Halifax and it's one of my favorite foods).

Their loss."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma is $10 including tax and includes a piece of baklava. Tap water is free if you ask for it. The garlic sauce was a bit sharp but no complaints overall. Definitely recommended for lunch downtown."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Chicken Shawarma i have ever had and the most expensive.  I go at lunch time so there is usually a line.  The lady making the sandwich acts like its an assembly line, slapping the sauce and everything on as fast as possible. I have tried 3 times now and its always the same.  Never going back.  The chicken is cold, the tomatoes are over ripe and disgusting.  This place is good at making sandwiches very fast but the result is barely edible.

Also the free Baklava they give you is so disgusting i dare you to eat it!"}
{"text":"A-OK. Decent meat and pita, but a bit pricey when compared to the small ass portions. Not bad when I'm in K-town. Try Jimmy's A&A on 20th and 13th NW and you'll see where I'm coming from.."}
{"text":"I'm always on the search for the perfect donair and I've had my fair share of good and (unfortunately) bad experiences.

Lucky for you Yelpers, I am here to tell you that Falafel King is on my good list! I usually get my donair to go but this last time I was with a coworker so we opted to dine in - yay for doing something different!

My go to: donair on whole wheat with lettuce, pickles, pickled cabbage, banana peppers and garlic sauce and then grilled to seal in all that goodness.

We managed to snag a table during the lunch rush and slowly upwrapped our newborn-baby sized wraps. As always mine was ah-mazing! I got to try my workers chicken shawarma and it was pretty darn tasty too! I only managed to eat half of mine, which is perfect - 3PM leftover donair snack at the office? YES PLEASE!

Although I haven't tried the other items on the menu, I'm sure they're all as equally delicious!"}
{"text":"Love it here. I also think the new location on Stephen Avenue is better than the old place. Where else can I get a savory, juicy handmade Falafel by the same guy who will refer to me as his friend even when he doesn't know my name. The food is great, but the machismo and hootspa in the service puts this place over the top. If you're lucky enough you might catch a day when they give out a piece of Baklava with purchase. Feels like you won $2 off a scratch lotto ticket!"}
{"text":"Right now, my favorite place to get a chicken shawarma... very reasonably priced and tasty.  Get it with everything... loved having the tahini and tabbouleh in with the chicken."}
{"text":"The best handmade falafel in Calgary. You have to come here starving, or the portions can be overwhelming. But the service is great, and if you stop in often enough, the owner refers to you as his best friend :) Their tabouleh salad and dolmades are delicious too. You almost want to cry when someone suggests Opa instead. No!"}
{"text":"Strong 3 for this restaurant. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap and falafel. Nothing was amazing but was good. I would try somewhere different next time in Calgary."}
{"text":"Every city has a place like this... the kind of place that does a few things only but does them very well. Falafel King really does know how to please in the Falafel department.  The service is impressive...lighting fast assembly line so you should really know what you want before you get up to the counter. Particularly at lunch all us suits and ties know the drill, order quickly and keep the line moving!  :)
The actual falafel balls ( is that what theyre called?) are the best Ive ever had , and being vegetarian I have had a lot. As well their dessert is the perfect ending to a great wrap. A delicious honey soaked baklava. Funny thing is I am not really a dessert person but for some reason I love these! 
The people at the counter taking your money are always personable and real, the type that call you buddy etc! I always feel like my money and business is appreciated.  Thanks for all the great wraps King!"}
{"text":"Although the food was not bad, it was not great either.  No real reason to go back, although I only went once.  I am afraid that it will be a while before I go back again.  
I have had much better donairs and pita wraps, which are somewhat different but basically the same.  
However, the baklava was great and the made to order fruit juice was as good as any.  The service was very cheerful and prompt."}
{"text":"Great service but but but but ........... the schwarma sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I would recommend the other Mediterranean place around the corner"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to come for a quick n' dirty downtown lunch.  I am a big fan of their chicken shawarma. My boyfriend loves the platters - I personally avoid as I don't want to smell like parsley, pickled cabbage and onions for the afternoon.  Everything is served with a yummy little two-bite baklava on the side as well. Delicious food, fast service, lots of seating if you want to eat in."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best place for middle eastern food, their meet is high quality meet. The owner is more than great, he always add something to the order for free... Love it!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for Shawarma in the city. Prices are a ouch higher than average at $9 for a pita and $12 for a plate, but Falafel King is justified in charging these rates as the portions are humongous. Bonus points for a free piece of baklava provided with every order!"}
{"text":"Good portion sizes but I wasn't a fan. Baklava was just mediocre also. Doesn't even come close to Jimmy's A&A."}
{"text":"As far as falafel and donairs go I really like this place; and the staff were exceptionally polite - even gave me a free dessert.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"In need of a quick and satisfying lunch today. Pulled in a 11:30am and waited in a short line to order the chicken on wholewheat with hot sauce. As always, a good choice for healthy lunch - some days though, the portion is a little too big. The value is debatable as you can spend $9.50 on other lunch 'stuff' that is not as good or repeatable.

Service is quick and friendly - these two guys work as a well synched machine to get you in and out with some good food!~"}
{"text":"For the decor, atmosphere, it's more than decent.  But for value, probably not, a $15 platters back home is unheard of lol.  Unless you're at a restaurant, this one's more of a deli-style.

Have to say though it's one of the nicer falafel places, it's bright and clean, and in a nice area, more for the office crowd.

Offer catering."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch time. Its located on Stephen Avenue Walk. So it is on a busy street. During lunch time expect to wait. Its great that finding a seat and or table isn't so bad. There is three of us and we walked in for lunch. I got the chicken Sharwarma. Price wise its not bad for the size of the Sharwarma. Its also taste ok. I mean its not WOW. 

Pop is $1.50 per can and not sure if you can get tap water (didn't ask but it looked like its probably not filtered tap water either).

So first bite was good. Most of the sauce is at the bottom. They use garlic sauce in their Chicken Sharwarma and not hummus. But I am fine with that. Wish there is more flavor in their meat or more of the donair grilled taste to it.

Overall, its not bad and I would come again."}
{"text":"Oh me oh my, you are not quite what I was expecting when I walked through your front door Falafel King. You're way too clean, too orderly, too spacious. And those are bad things? Well, let's just say it takes away from the hole-in-the-wall concept I thought you were the numerous times I've walked by and put a different spin on your food. 

I wonder if it's possible to run out of sitting room here? Because there is ample. The restaurant runs deep into the back of the building. There are tables flanking the wall, and then a much bigger seating area towards the back. When I popped in, there was a football game playing on the flat screens mounted to the wall. How many falafel shops do you know with flat screens?

The man working behind the counter made me a chicken shawarma with everything on it. \"Good for you!\" he replied after my nod to include even the banana peppers. He wrapped the shawarma, warmed it in the grill by the till (I'm a poet and I didn't know it ;p) and included a bite sized piece of baklava on the side. The chicken shawarma was nice and warm, and big as shawarmas usually are. But that baklava... as soon as I bit into it, my mouth filled with the sweetness of honey and pastry flakes. Yum!

Between the delicious food and the classier decor, this is a spot no downtown office goer should think twice about walking into."}
{"text":"Healthier than most fast food around downtown... The location is very convenient.. And the shawarmas are really good... they are also BIG shawarmas!!... This is a good place to go if you are in a rush or just feel like you want fast food for a day... I would definitely go back there!!.."}
{"text":"Brought another friend to Falafel King as she has never had Lebanese food before.  She had the Chicken Shawarma and she liked it.  I had the Greek Salad and 3 Falafel Balls with Tahini Sauce.  It was a big lunch as the salad was quite a big plate.  The Falafel balls were a little on the salty side and needs more tahini sauce.  The best part was the free baklava with our meals!"}
