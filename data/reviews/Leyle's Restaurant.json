{"text":"I may be a little late in getting my submission in as we dined at this location back in July 2015. The decor and ambiance was nice done as you will see lots of work was put into it. For the food (even though we used a Groupon), the portions were big enough to fill each person up and were very tasty! Nothing was over cooked and remained tender and juicy. We even had the owner come out to talk to us so that we can compliment the chef on the food and how the place was done. Will definitely return!  Great place to go to!"}
{"text":"same brunch experience as the other reviewer. hilton markham would be much much better for almost the same price  3 types of benedicts, waffle, pancake, french toast, 3 sausages, beans, oat meals and that's about it for hot food, u can see the food quality yourself. service and decor is good"}
{"text":"Tried Leyle's for my moms bday dinner. I had the chicken fajitas and my mom had their persian vaziri dish. I was definitely satisfied with this place ! huge portions & delicious food. Really nice looking place too, spoke with owner & he invited us back to try their new buffet brunch starting in 2 weeks as well, which i am looking forward to! if its anything like the dinner it will prob be amazing. Recommend Leyles for sure."}
{"text":"Despite the negative comments from the groupon experience, they must have changed the menu. We had the salad, shared the calamari, had the steak medium rare and awaiting the dessert now. We found it to be very very good and would definitely come back or refer friends."}
{"text":"Leyle's understands what clients want, good quality food, good service and reasonable prices. My family and I first went to Leyle's for dinner and we were very impressed by their food! It was clearly made with good quality ingredients and beautifully presented. We went back again for their brunch after a friend recommended it and had to wait few minutes before getting seated. We were there with a toddler but they immediately brought us a high chair and gave us a private and comfortable table. The restaurant was packed and people were clearly enjoying themselves. Once we sat down we knew why it was so popular. There was a variety of delicious Iranian and western breakfast options and my husband and I both agreed the eggs Benedict were spot on! It was wonderful having a variety of Persian delicacies available since we had non-permian guests with us and they could try yummy dishes that take forever to make at home like their tasty haleem!! We have since been back several times with our parents and their friends who have come to love the idea of a Persian Brunch on a Sunday morning. We recently celebrated Iranian New Year there and once again Leyle's didn't disappoint. It was good to see them putting their customer's interest ahead of their own and their staff were so gracious and kind. Would we go back again?? definitely!"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs.  Went for Valentine's day on a Sunday in February. It was a super cold morning and they had not heated the place overnight, so the room was freezing when we walked in. We had to eat with our coats on...for Valentine's day brunch...unbelievable. When we complained, they said that heat was on max, but it was cold and it would take a while to heat the place up ?? (how about heating before you open??).I was so embarrassed to bring my family there. Also, at some point, as the chef was adding food to one of the trays hit a small sign indicating the food in the trays. The sign fell in the food...totally gross, then he picked up the sign from the food, placed it back on the table (without cleaning it) and instead of replacing the food in the tray, acted like nothing had happened. The signed had probably never been washed, handled by dozens of people, likely fell other times in the food, sorry, but that's not what I expect from a restaurant. The food was ok though, too expensive for what it was, but decent."}
{"text":"It is so far best Persian buffet for breakfast and for sure we will go back again. You can find almost different type of plates for breakfast from pure Persian to American and there is some thing for every taste and interest."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by this upscale Persian/American restaurant. Excellent food and service. We are bringing friends here Saturday evening."}
{"text":"I invited my friend first time here and he was shocked by the resturant services, owner came and ask to give him feedback which is very rare in Iranian bussines he was very friendly and warm  Our server was so professional, friendly and so caring  I am super happy withthe Leyle's services  Looking forward to being there again"}
{"text":"We had a chance to have a wonderful conversation with incredible owner/chef, such a lovely personality and very welcoming . We where there for the weekends brunch buffet and the verity of foods is acceptable and very good . We realized that this restaurant is very well know also for steak and see food for diner. We definitely go back there and we recommend this place.   We are back again. Again we have been facing wonderful service and great fo"}
{"text":"Please see their old yelp page that they are trying to run away from. The restaurant has not renovated they just don't want people to see all the negative reviews on there.  The old page has 38 fake reviews removed from yelp. There is a long list of poor management from the owner of this restaurant from Groupon scams to blaming the customer over basic complaints to stealing tips (my personal experience). Take a closer look at all the good reviews on here while some may be legit some are so fake over praising the restaurant and it's food."}
{"text":"Great presentation, wonderful foods, amazing service, beautiful decorations, exceeded all of our expectation. I highly recommend this restaurant to you. They also offer best Persian brunch in town with yummy Spinach eggs florentine and tons of fresh fruits all you can eat."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for dinner. The ambiance was delightful, service was amazing, a family owned business - the owners take pride in their business and their hospitality is beyond anything I've seen in Ontario.  Food: was excellent very generous portions, everyone was very happy with their food, even to the extent that someone from our party ordered a steak that was medium rare, when the steak came it was well done. it was replaced right away and everyone of the staff could not apologize enough. The chef (who I believe is also the owner) came out personally and took responsibility for the overcooked steak. The food was fresh and delicious.  I cannot recommend this place enough and we will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent quality ingredients, a lot of heart and passion in the making of dishes, and generous portion sizes!  Owner gets into the kitchen himself to make the food, and comes out to get feedback and ensure that customers are satisfied.  Beautiful dining lounge, servers move and behave in a way befitting a fine dining steakhouse.  A real hidden gem in Thornhill - will come back as often as possible!"}
{"text":"Little too pricey for my budget but what can I say I got good taste, I think you get what you pay for, all together we tried few of there dishes and we were all happy costumers."}
{"text":"I came here for the karaoke event on a Wednesday night. The karaoke is just Persian songs and on the stage. The place was not crowded but they were busy from 10pm + till 12:30. I ordered shock top beer ( served with too much foam) calamari and sweet potato fries  The bill came up to $65 which included 2 glasses of wine   There was also a $10 cover charge for the karaoke night ( Wednesday and Friday nights )  Everyone was mainly Persian and it seems best to go to this place with a group. The service was really good, we loved our waitress she was really attentive!  The atmosphere was nice, they should add candles on the tables as an extra touch"}
{"text":"Last night my friend and I checked out Leyle's for dinner. The man working there were very kind and he immediately cleaned a table for us and got us set up at a booth. He brought us the menus and a pitcher of water. He then told us about their special of the day.   The special of the day was a dinner for two, which featured three types of meat, rice, and two salads for $50.00.   Our salads were presented beautifully. I thought we would receive one big salad to share but we each received a huge salad that was presented really well. It featured mixed lettuce, cabbage, beats, cucumber, tomatoes, and a balsamic vinaigrette.   Our meat entr√©e arrived with a skewer of chicken, lean beef and a blend of beef/onions and other ingredients that kind of tasted like a burger patty.   My favourite meat was the chicken. It was really tender and full of flavour. My next favourite meat was the beef to the left of the chicken in the photograph. It was very lean and flavourful.   The final meat, which was the blend of beef, onion and other ingredients was my least favourite meat but it was my friend's favourite meat. He really liked the flavour combination.   The rice tasted really good and was a good side dish for the meats.  Would I return? Yes, I would definitely return to this location for another meal."}
{"text":"I went to breakfast buffet. I hear they have increased the price quite a bit over the last year or so. I ended up paying over 32$ for a single person with tax and tip. I arrived around noon. some of the food was so stale to the point you wouldn't eat it. All or party ended up getting stomach ache afterwards. I hear it was good food and good price before. My experience: Over priced and the food (the portion that was not stale) was not worth it. Friendly staff though. Would not go back and do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place.Best breakfast buffet in Toronto..We had such an amazing morning with the best buffet experience. Great customer service and everything was so fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh food, excellent service, clean and cozy environment. We enjoyed our lunch ( joojeh kabab) with salad."}
{"text":"Amazing place. I'm a person who loves food and this place is the, #1 Place in GTA, for breakfast!!!! Amazing service!!! Great food. Deserves Seven Stars.  %100 must go."}
{"text":"No star - horrible experience. I went there for brunch/lunch and Manager has no flexibility as to an expired groupon i had and said i had to come back for dinner. No I'm never going back."}
{"text":"We went there for Sunday brunch buffet. Very descent food, with proper variety on dishes. The owner came to us very friendly and welcoming, and treated us with extra's. The ambiance is also very nice and cozy. I had great experience here and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had food at Leyle. Calling them for take-out at 7:30pm on a Tuesday was probably an unusual request. I ordered two rack of lamb dinners. When I walked into the place it was surprisingly empty. I was greated by a very friendly person who immediately took me to sit at the bar in comfort while I waited a few minutes. The chef came out to show me the lamb asking if it was too rare - it was perfect. When I arrived home I was shocked that the chef had included in the bag about a dozen and a half pieces of lamb \"lollipops\" in jus. Amazing and very kind. There was a huge portion of delicious herbed potatoes, yams and shake mushrooms. Plus, he made a fabulous chef's salad, which I had not ordered, but he said he would put one in on the house. Teresa was enough food for four and it was delicious! Prepared very simply so that all the natural flavors flourished. This place should never be empty, not even late on a Tuesday night! Try it out."}
{"text":"Four of us went for dinner last night...what a find! Everything we had, from appetizer to dessert, was interesting and delicious. The menu is full of items that look good but unlike a lot of restaurants, this place actually delivers on it. Quality is top notch: from the tender rib eye, to the thick halibut fillets, to the large shrimp and scallops. The presentation and delicious flavour combinations make it obvious that the cook knows what he is doing, and cares to do it right. We shared two appetizers: fried calamari which was lightly battered, and shrimp and scallops in Pernod sauce (if you like anise flavour you'll love it, but it is an acquired taste). For mains, two of us had the pistachio crusted halibut, which was lightly crusted and very tasty (I'm looking forward to my leftovers tonight). One had the ribeye which was tender, juicy, well marbled and drizzled with a delicious sauce. One had shrimp and scallops on top of a leek mixture - beware, it is called a fondue in the menu but is not a dip. For dessert we shared tiramisu cheesecake - yum!  The service was also great. Our server was friendly, helpful and funny. I wish I could remember her name (maybe Teresa?). We ran into the owner on our way outside; he was also friendly and genuinely seemed to care how our visit was. We will most definitely be back."}

{"text":"UNETHICAL! This place has dishonest business practices. Read the original Yelp page for this business before it moved pages to escape bad reviews (the restaurant itself did not move, all of the contact information is still the same)   https://www.yelp.ca/biz/leyles-seafood-and-steak-house-thornhill-2   Pay attention to the writing style and phrases like \"excellent\", \"amazing\" used in the reviews for this business. Notice how many other reviewers have only ever written 1 review.  We came here using a $69 for a 3 course meal for two ($119 value). Incredibly misleading as the Groupon leads you to believe you get to choose items from the menu (which is posted on the Groupon site as well) In reality you are forced to choose from steak, salmon or chicken.   The food:  - cleanliness: so many flies... one landed on my food and I snapped a photo of it.  - value: not worth the a la carte prices, not even close. The steak we had was the cheapest cut you could find at the grocery store.. I've had better steak in a steak and eggs meal at a 24 hour diner.  - food quality: doesn't even come close to a lower end chain restaurant level (think Applebee's, Jack Astors, Casey's)  Will never return."}
{"text":"Never gonna be tired of this place !!!! Our host,Sara, was amazing as always and the chef, he is always there to make sure you have everything you need !! 5 star customer service with 5 star brunch ..recommend this place %100"}
{"text":"So, here I am in the washroom of Lyle's writing this review. Why so upfront about something so personal? Because the food hit me like a brick and I've been back and forth from my table since then.  The problem I have with this place is that the owner sunk money into this place, like it looks gorgeous (especially for Thornhill) but aesthetics only get you so far in this game. For fathers day this place wasn't as busy as I though it would be. We were one of 3 other groups today in the evening. I at least thought that service would be quick due to the lack of orders. Here we are about an 1 hour and 45 minutes later and are just wrapping up our meal.   Service was slow and the food (if you haven't clued in yet) might not be as fresh as hoped. The sad part is that the food tasted good. The trout I ordered skimped on the rice (which I found really confusing) and for some reason the season veggies were all sweet which I didn't expect/care for.  The other thing I was scratching my head about was the prices. $26 for the Trout was WAY too expensive for what I received in return and that was the cheapest fish entree I could find that wasn't Fish and Chips. On that note, I couldn't make heads or tails of the menu itself. I got a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern feel when I looked at the first page which was fine, but then there are burgers, French Onion Soup and Tex Mex Items on the menu which made no sense what so ever. It was just felt like it was slapped on there but didn't fit at all. It looked confused and made me question what I was going to expect.   When I walked in initially I expected a good meal and it turned for the worse. There are a lot of gaps and things that just left me wondering \"Why?\" more than anything. It might be just one bad experience for me alone. I'd be willing to give this place another shot, but I might have to wait a while before I can re align my stomach."}
{"text":"Big portions, rly good food, would definitely come again.  Service was good, waiter was pretty nice too."}
{"text":"Wow we picked up a groupon deal for a 4 course meal. We had tried the escargot and bruschetta. Both we excellent. We had the garden salad and the dressing was very good with fresh tomato sand spring mix. My date had the pan seared salmon and I had the angus steak. Both were generous size and delicious. We shared the tiramisu cake with fresh berries. I highly recommend this place. We will be back."}
{"text":"Best break fast brunch in town. The food is soooo fresh and the staff is so polite and friendly. The restaurant manager is always present and makes sure if the customers are happy. He even brings you fresh cooked food to your table. I surely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for bunch this morning with family. Food was not that good, pretty basic compared to the pictures they have up. Wish they had a larger variety of food for an all you can eat buffet. On the bright note the interior was good very nicely designed, great for taken photos and snaps. Food not worth snapping."}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch and breakfast place. I've been here three weekends in a row and I can't get enough of it! It is a buffet brunch and has all kind of breakfast including traditional persian and popular western types! The manager is so nice and professional, he comes to your table once in a while to make sure that you are happy with the meal or if you need anything! They have even brought us fresh waffles and egg Benedict to our table! Staff are super friendly and the ambiance in warm! Highly recommended!"}
