{"text":"Missed eating quality pasta since becoming gluten free. Found this gem on Bloor Street. Authentic pasta with a variety of options. Perfect for take out, on the subway line and quick service. 

Love the name too."}
{"text":"Very tasty freshly made pasta that can be combined with a variety of sauces. Small space designed more for takeout, but they have a few small tables in the courtyard in the summer. $5 lunch special on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I think that I have found a hidden gem here!  I have walked past their storefront location many times but last week I decided to go in and take a look.  I found a nice clean retail store/restaurant that serves some amazing fresh pasta and homemade sauces.  

I did not have time to eat there so I picked up a to go package of their spaghetti with bolognese sauce.  I ate it when I got home and WOW the sauce was great.  The sauce was not too salty or acidic and had a nice amount of fresh torn herbs in it and cheese on top.  The pasta was al dente and had a nice bite to it.  I ended up eating the other half the next day for lunch and it travelled well.

I had a nice conversation with the woman there and she said that they also are avaliable to do parties, festvals and corporate gaterings ect.

I will not hesitate to come back and try some of their stuffed pastas and some of their different sauces in the future."}
{"text":"I was expecting this pasta place to be the usual type of sauce and pasta you can get anywhere. Definitely not the case. Their mushroom ravioli is actually filled with mushrooms unlike most other places that use mostly cheese and breadcrumbs. Sauces are flavourful and the spicy is quite spicy. We love the cheese tortollini as well."}
{"text":"Small portions for high cost. I've had canned sauce sold at grocery store that was less watery and more flavourful. The pasta is supposedly handmade but tastes the same as refrigerated pasta from grocery store."}
{"text":"My kitchen is out of commission and I wanted good Italian without taking my 2 young kids out to a restaurant.  Decided to check this place out.  Found out they are closing soon (no actual closing date).  Apparently the new min wages and costs have taken a toll on small businesses.  The owner gave me and the lady on front of me the whole story.  I feel for small business and definitely support them.  Due to this the selection remaining was limited.  So only had what was available that can be cooked with a microwave or toaster oven.  Only thing available was a small dish of frozen ricotta cheese cannelloni (4 pieces), a small dish with 4 small meat ball and tomato sauce and a small jar of homemade pasta sauce enough for the cannelloni.  Total price $32!  This is a one person meal.  Not only do I have to defrost all of this and microwave it, this was a meal enough for only one.  And I'm not a big eater.  A little pricey when I can eat at good quality pasta at a restaurant with service and no dishes to wash.  I felt too bad for the owner to put things back on the shelf so tried it out.  The concept is good but the prices are too much to do repeat business.  It's a one time thing at these prices.  I expected to be above grocery prices but below Restaurant prices.  Unfortunately they can't make the concept work.  Food was good overall but not the best and it's priced too much for extra trouble on my end"}
{"text":"VERY cool place! Basically a pasta lovers dream. Choose your pasta and then your sauce and then it's vacuum sealed in a cool package. Very delicious. Highly recommend. My hubby says try the gnocchi with rose sauce ;-)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing - excellent quality pasta and sauces for good prices. I've tried almost all of the dishes and they're all great - my fav is any pasta with alfredo sauce or alla vodka. Portions are big, especially for the basic pastas (fusilli, spaghetti etc). So glad to have found a takeaway alfredo that is actually beautifully creamy yet not dripping in butter! Amazing place - I'm in trouble when they team up with a delivery service, I'll be eating it every day!"}
{"text":"Delicious pasta with countless sauce combinations, all made fresh to order! I love the fact that you can pick and choose your noodles with your sauce of choice. The gluten-free options are also awesome for my friend who's a celiac and usually can't enjoy pasta out.

Also catered a luncheon for my co-workers and delivery was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Cute little pasta shop offering fresh made pasta and sauce! Dine in or takeout! First heard about it on groupon! Then instagram when they were promoting their $5 Tuesday pasta day! Awesome fine! Can't wait to try everything on their menu! Love how if u eat in they put it in an actual pasta bowl with cutlery! Love environmentally friendly shops!!! I rarely do 5 stars! But this place exceeded my expectation in terms of prices and tastes!"}
