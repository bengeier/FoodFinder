{"text":"As far as pizzerias go, this was an extreme disappointment. Service was incredibly slow and the pizza was so soggy it might as well have been soup. Besides that, the pizza was also nearly flavourless and cold when it was served to us. And can we say rubbery cheese? What about prosciutto saltier than the ocean? It goes without saying that I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have written many reviews and I hate to have to write a bad review. However, I have to say that there were no redeeming elements of our trip to Via Mercanti. It was a very disappointing dinner with friends. My husband and I took the trip up north to Via Mercanti for dinner and were excited to try the food after reading some reviews on the website. The first dish that we had was the arancini balls. They were dry and heavy and devoid of flavour. The calamari was passable at best, however, they did tend more towards the rubbery side. Think things can't get worse? The pizza we ordered was supposed to be Diavolo, it had huge chunks of pork and sliced yellow peppers - there was no element of spicy, as the name would dictate. It was one of the worst pizzas I have had in a long time. The veal with mushroom sauce came out with a tasteless mushroom sauce that actually had a live fly stuck in the sauce. I was able to save the fly, but I think he died a short time later. This tasted like a jarred sauce. We left there that night marvelling over the fact that every dish that was served got worse as the night wore on."}
{"text":"One thing that comes to mind for this place is \"average\".  The pizza was ok.  Our server was Italian so there was that for authenticity but nothing about the meal was remarkable in any way.  The one saving grace for me was the fried seafood appetizer (mostly calamari, and a few shrimp).  The portion was huge and I was almost full before my pizza even came out, which by the way took a little longer than I would have liked.  The service overall was a little slow.  Given the abundance of Italian options around the area, this place does not stand out."}
{"text":"Just as good as their Kensington Market location. Traditional Neapolitan pizza. The sauce is delicious! Good service, free parking."}
{"text":"My wife and I are big fans of the Via Mercanti in Kensington Market and we were thrilled to learn that there is a location closer to our home. We arrived at this modest restaurant in an industrial area with very high expectations. However, the restaurant exceeded all of our expectations in a very significant manner. Our server, Sabrina, was an absolute delight! In addition, the risotto was extremely flavourful and the pizzas were second to none! We also enjoyed the live entertainment! The performers had the entire crowd singing Italian songs with them and they willingly took requests! It took us about five minutes to decide that this restaurant is now our new favourite restaurant anywhere! In our opinion, you can't go wrong dining at this location. The food is awesome, the service is second to none, and the entertainment is absolutely wonderful! The management of this restaurant has done an amazing job! They clearly know how to deliver an excellent product!"}
{"text":"Resto is in an unassuming business unit & has a small patio. Food was good, had salad & pizza. The salad portions are huge, enough to share. Pizza was good enough to go back. Wine list was limited & service was just ok. Server got our order wrong, but it worked out bc the portions were large."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were told to try the pizza at this place from a regular customer who swears by their Neapolitan style pizzas.  Unfortunately we visited late on a weekday (9:15pm) and their kitchen was already closed, so they offered us takeout. They later changed their mind and was kind enough to accommodate us for pizza - which is what we came in for which was awesome!

Beniamino who served us was so kind and welcoming.

The place had a contemporary feel. A group of older Italian men socializing in the corner having their espressos and digestivos which reassured me that this place was legit LOL.

We both ordered Margherita pizzas. I like to try the basic pizzas for a joint I am trying for the first time to really taste their quality in ingredients. I requested mine to be spicy (option not offered on the menu) and they were happy to do so.

They pizzas really hit the spot of my 2 week craving of true Italian pizza. The pizzas were light, simple and flavorful. We finished off with some good limoncello mmm. 

FYI majority of the cooks are from Napoli! ;)"}
{"text":"Best lamb spaducci's in the city hands down. 

This is a gem of a place. Really simple low cost food done exceptionally well.

 
Great patio as well that is cigar friendly on specific days."}
{"text":"After having excellent experiences at the Via Mercanti locations in Kensington, on Elm, and on Gerrard East; I was looking forward to another great time at their north location. I was greatly disappointed.

The food was okay, but not up to the same standard as the other locations. Specifically, the pizza dough (something they are known for) was undercooked and even wet. The service was what stood out as what makes this location so far behind. While the restaurant was only half full, the service was still slow and disorganized."}
{"text":"I've been making the rounds throughout the GTA to taste every pizza restaurant that bills itself as serving authentic Neapolitan pizza.  This place does that and so tonight, I was in the area and tried it out.

I elected to go take out style and ate the pizza on my car roof.  I ordered a regular Margherita pizza.

The size was standard fare and from the picture, you will see that the pizza was undercooked for a Neapolitan pizza.  The trademark burnt and bubbles crust are clearly not there.  This is a huge deal for Neapolitan pizza because it either means the oven isn't hot enough or the pizzaiolo undercooked it. 

Secondly, the pizza sauce or the pizza itself was over salted.  I like my salt by on Neapolitan pizza, you should be able to clearly taste the sweetness of the San Marzano tomatoes and the salt just overpowered it.  It's too bad because I could taste hints of a wonderful sauce which would be quickly overtaken by a briny flavour.

Lastly, I cheese and basil were tasty and while the cheese had a generous amount, I literally got one basil per quarter of the pizza.

I'll give this place another try down the road but out of 4 places I've tried, this would be in last place right now.

P.S. I handed the waitress a $20 bill for a $15 pizza and she asked me if I wanted change and seemed very offended when I said \"yes.\"  Was I suppose to leave a tip for take out service?"}
