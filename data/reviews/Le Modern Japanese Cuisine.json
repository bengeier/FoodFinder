{"text":"Bad sushi... no wonder it was empty. Not only bad, it was also expensive at $100 pre tax for 2 for lunch without drinks. Didn't eat 1/2 of what was served. Some dishes were okay but most were weird and the uni dishes were really bad and foul tasting."}
{"text":"I came for dinner tonight for the second time after the first month they opened.  And we ordered the sashimi platter, aburi nigiri, and angel roll.  I liked their focus on a simple menu, a little bit of everything.  It is nice that they have a much expanded drinks menu as well dessert menu.  The food was decorated nicely and made of high quality.     The servers, while they are not trained to fine dining level, were really putting an effort to perfect our dining experience.  For instance, when we would told that the Crepe cake were sold out.  She offered us to sample another dessert that is not released on the menu yet, on the house.    Most people would compare with similar restaurants in downtown, but with Le Modern's price-to-quality ratio, dedicated staff, modern atmosphere.  Also, they are right at home in Markham.  I honestly would not bother going downtown for alternatives."}
{"text":"Came here on a sleepy Sunday afternoon for lunch. Did not expect to find a nice looking japanese restaurant in a small ordinary looking business building. The place is nice and clean and well decorated. Service was quick and friendly even though there was only one waitress working. We ordered a lunch combo and a Okonomiyaki. The portion size was quite impressive, the rolls were very well made. The Okonomiyaki which is usually a disappointing item at a lot of other places was actually done pretty well. Lots of ingredients and can tell that it was made fresh. Overall for a quick lunch it was quite enjoyable. Will look forward to trying out a dinner."}
{"text":"A little bit hard to find but I really enjoy the food, especially the lotus chips, Angel Roll and torched sushi."}
{"text":"Went to Le Modern Japanese for dinner on Saturday. At around 9pm, the restaurant was pretty empty, so we were served promptly. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and reflects its name well.  We ordered the Coffee Butter Steak, Oshizushi, Pirate Roll, and salmon & uni sashimi. The sashimi tasted pretty fresh, and I was quite pleased with the quality of the uni. The Oshizushi consisted of 8 different morsels--2 of each type. They were all pretty delicious, but nothing seemed to be especially different. The Coffee Butter Steak came next, along with an aromatic coffee smell. It smelled amazing, however, I personally failed to taste any coffee in the steak. Nonetheless, it was a decent steak. Lastly, came the Pirate Roll. I was anticipating a lot from this roll as it seemed to garner a lot of positive reviews, and it definitely did not disappoint. The roll encompasses a variety of delicious ingredients all into one bite.  While we did not order a ton, the bill came to nearly $80 before tax. Despite the fact that the food comes with a hefty price, I would say the experience at Le Modern was quite pleasant, as we were served within reasonable time and treated nicely. The ambience is also soothing, and I would come again."}
{"text":"I went there twice with my friends. To be honest, the special lunch menu had very modest prices with its food. I didn't expect too much on its lunch menu because it is obviously prepared for people working around there based on its prices. I tried the chicken teriyaki combo and it was quite unexpectedly good . For the dinner, I love the 12pcs nigiri and the sashimi platter a lot! It was an amazing dinner with such high level sushi! The wasabi was hand made! However, I think there exists a huge gap between lunch menu and diner menu. Because diner menu items are more fancy and delicious. All in all, it's worth every penny of it!"}
{"text":"Tried to come here over the weekend as I checked the hours online beforehand and it stated they were open until 11.  I arrived at just before 10pm and they were already closed.  I thought that perhaps the hours listed on Yelp were incorrect but when I checked the hours posted on their window, that also stated that they were supposed to close at 11pm.    For a new business, this is terrible business practice.  If you state online and post on your window that you open until a certain time, you need to actually stay open until that time and not close more than an earlier regardless of whether business is slow or not."}
{"text":"Very hard to find, but glad I had directions from blogto.  Tried their carbonara, it was very creamy and there was no skimping on the bacon and shrimp. A very filling meal.  My friend tried the chiraishi don and was happily surprised by the delicious salmon and bonus octopus.  Decor is a definite plus for the experience. Nice wooden tables and cutlery.  There's no dessert menu though so gotta find somewhere else to get my sweet fix."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night with 2 of my girlfriends. This place is pretty spacious, and the decor is nice and simple.   We ordered 5 dishes in total. We got the Aburi Nigiri, Salmon Oshizushi, Pirate Roll, black cod and the carbonara.   My friends and I always go to Jabistro so it was hard not to compare the two restaurants as the plating and sushi offered were quite similar. The presentation of the pirate roll is very similar to the Jabistroll. However, there is a vast difference in quality. In the pirate roll offered by Le Modern, we couldn't even taste the uni. It's decent but definitely not as good as Jabistroll. The Aburi Nigiri was alright, again not as good as the pressed sushi offered at Jabistro. We also felt that the rice fell apart really easily. I thought the best dish was the Salmon Oshizushi. The black cod was nothing special either, wasn't tender enough in my opinion. The least favourite dish was the udon carbonara. It was wayyy too sweet. It was so sweet that we thought the chef had accidentally put in sugar instead of salt. Definitely would not recommend this dish.   Overall the experience was good. The service was great as well. We all agreed that we would come back in the future. After we paid the restaurant also gave each of us a $10 off coupon for next time if we spent $50 or more.   If I wanted a quick sushi fix I would come here as its better than other Japanese places in Markham. However, for the price, I would most definitely prefer to dine at Jabistro instead if I had to choose."}
{"text":"Everything about Le Modern - the minimalistic grey tone decor, this heavy old-style teapot they use, to the above-average price range menu - makes you think this gourmet style restaurant is going to be amazing. Unfortunately this wasn't the case.   In its defence, the waiter brought us complimentary lotus root chips (?) upon ordering, and these were really good. The menu, though lacking bento/meal/combo options, seems really innovative and interesting.   However, despite Le Modern's attempt to be a gourmet style restaurant, it really doesn't bring the quality one expects. We ordered a roll and the coffee bean steak. The roll is really nothing out of the ordinary, honestly, and a bit bland. The coffee  bean steak is essentially a small piece of steak (though prepared well) with a few coffee beans around it. You can't really taste any coffee.   I had pretty good expectations walking into the place - it's in sort of a small business plaza and seemed like a good location for a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been several times and thoroughly enjoyed everything every time.  I lived in Japan for four years so I'm not really a roll sushi person and prefer sashimi and nigiri...so I can't speak to the quality of their rolls.  For price, the sashimi is good but nothing stellar. Where they really stand out is the rice. It is perfectly seasoned so be sure to get some nigiri (I imagine rolls would be good too).  The oshizushi (pressed sushi) is quite good. It's dressed a little non-traditionally but I definitely plan to order it again.  Their sides (squid, lobster miso, etc.) are all pretty good. The matcha mille-feuille crepe cake is lovely too.  Be warned, they put wasabi under the fish in nigiri like shops in Japan. Also, a coworker of mine said their rice was falling apart the one time he went. I've never seen that happen so I can't say much about it.   This shop has become my go-to restaurant when I want good sushi."}
{"text":"I can appreciate places like this opening up in Markham so that us suburb folks don't always have to make the trek downtown for something a little different. That said, however, it was only a decent experience here at best:  - PIRATE ROLL: 8-piece roll with uni, sriracha mayo, tuna(?). you don't often see uni offered in rolls, so we were really looking forward to this one. rather tasty overall but unfortunately the uni itself was really negligible -- we think it might have been mixed in with the mayo on top  - CHIRASHI DON: the fish roe was a nice touch and lots of it too; sizeable pieces of fish. - MISO BLACK COD: i've had a mind blowing miso black cod once before and haven't come across this dish since, so this was my first pick off the menu. ultimately the minimalist plating couldn't justify the fish -- i had expected something much more flavourful and buttery, both of which didn't come through here. the lemon zest ontop brought a nice fragrance, however. - the NIGIRI was beautifully plated - i didn't try the OSHIZUSHI but from across the table I was disappointed to see that two of the eight pieces were served with just avocado (and sauce) ontop. I'd much rather have seen something of more value, even if they need to justify with a slightly higher price tag - the OKONOMIYAKI was a good serving size and I don't think anyone had any complaints there  Finally, we were pleasantly pleased with the wasabi here, of all things! Had a lot more flavour than just burn, both of which are rare to come by"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. The decor was simple. There were only two tables so service was quick. Service was average at best. Nothing special. The first thing i noticed was the very limited and small menu. I was hoping to be able to order a small boat or platter to share amongst our guests.  The food.. in my opinion was \"meh\". Nothing special. The fish on my friends sashimi set did not look to fresh. Signs of oxidations were present by the time the plate got to the table.   The rolls tasted very plain and average at best.   I ordered a teriyaki bento with short ribs. The short ribs were well seasoned. Maybe overly seasoned? I found myself extra thirsty after my meal. There must have either been a ton of sodium or MSG or both.   The cheese wontons were interesting. I believe it was a cream cheese filling. That was the ONE delightful surprise I had at this place. I had moderate to high hopes for this place as the previous pictures looked delicious and had decent reviews.  Maybe their dinner menu would be more extensive and tastier? Don't think I will be coming back though."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed that the menu was anything but spectacular. I've been to many downtown restaurants that are around the same price point but is way better.   I got there around 8:30 at night and they were nice enough to hold our table for longer than 30 minutes even though we were late (hence why it's a 2 star and not 1 star). We were greeted at the door but the noise level was significantly high. The room was very square so the sounds from every conversation bounced off of each other.   We had salmon roll, lobster roll, okonomiyaki, ozisushi set, sashimi sample and maybe others that I cannot remember.  Regardless, the only thing worth mentioning was the ozisushi set ($20). Everything else was all you can eat quality. The rice was very dry and although I did read reviews about the mediocre lunch quality, I thought dinner would be different.   Everything took very long to get there and flagging down a waiter/waitress was incredibly difficult.   Hopefully they will improve sometime in the future, but I will not be going back for such an expensive price unless something is improved."}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed with this place. Although I won't consider this place high end, they excelled in all areas I think are important for good restaurants. Superb service, nice clean place, modern decor.   Now the food. All the food had great presentation, they all had presence. All the details of the dishes were appreciated and were executed nicely. All the food had fresh ingredients and were prepared fresh. I really like the Pirate roll, it looked really nice and all the ingredients blended well together and had great flavour. Although I couldn't really taste the uni but the freshness of the salmon and snow crab stood out. And I looooove tobiko! Salmon Oshizushi was also good. Flavours were great and blended well, better than KaKa. Also liked the freshly prepared okonomiyaki fries and karaage. Who doesn't love okonomiyaki and fried foods? And mayo! The hot rod roll looked great on the plate but I thought lacked flavour, couldn't really taste the tuna inside. But I've never had good fried sushi before, it doesn't seem like a good idea.   The rice and noodle dishes (carbonara, oyakodon) didn't really hit the spot for me. Lacked flavour and execution. We will leave those off our list next time. The grilled squid was also meh for me, tasted a bit overcooked or not fresh.   Otherwise really liked the nice quiet atmosphere. Courteous service. Allowed us to eat cake we brought and gave us the complimentary squid for my birthday. And the sushi and rolls were fantastic. This place is kind of hidden in a commercial building, that might explain the low traffic at night time. I will definitely be back for the crepe cakes!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for lunch and remembered I've been meaning to check this place out.   As I had my heart set on trying their famous oshizushi I was slightly disappointed there was no lunch special that incorporated them. It looks like they have many great lunch special options but alas I had to order off the regular menu.   I ordered the salmon oshizushi which was 6 pieces for $15. It was very nicely made I just wish it was 8 pieces for that price.   I also ordered 2 pieces of tuna sushi and 3 slices of salmon sashimi. The fish tasted excellent, generous portions and very fresh.   Overall I thought it was good and I would try again for dinner. However I did find they charged on the high side considering it's not downtown."}
{"text":"Second place in GTA with aburi style sushi. Lacked authenticity in the flavouring. Their surf clam sashimi was the freshest I've ever tasted but it was the opposite for the sea urchin sashimi. Rice dish was decent. Nice restaurant and not very crowded."}
{"text":"Food was great, atmosphere is nice and place is very clean. I had the unagi don and my friend had the nigiri platter. We finished off with the green tea crepe cake. That was the only question mark we had. I liked he cake, but there's something lacking. For a place this new, they are pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch because the pictures of this place looked really modern and spacious and I wanted to try it out.   This meal included a salad and a miso soup.  I tried their combo three - spicy salmon and spicy tuna roll ($10) and it wasn't as expected. The pieces were large, but unfortunately the pieces of rice weren't very sticky and kept falling off of the seaweed. The salmon was okay, but the tuna didn't taste fresh at all. It tasted like AYCE quality.   In addition, I came here in a group of nine and even though five of us ordered first, my order came twenty minutes before everyone else's order, which made me feel uncomfortable because I was the only one with a plate of food while everyone didn't yet."}
{"text":"Le Modern Japanese Cuisine is a new Japanese restaurant opened at around woodbine and Highway 7 hiding within an office building plaza.  I saw some of my friends uploading pictures from this place and decided to give this a try.  Once I was in, I loved the decoration.  Very modern style (fits the name perfectly), with lots of natural sunlight from the big windows.  The table design really impressed me as well, it was made out of wood, but they are shaped differently and not your typical rectangular tables.  My friend and I ordered the Grilled Squid, Oknomiyaki, Aburi Nigiri and the Pirate Roll to share.  We wrapped it off with the Tiramisu crepe cake.  The Grilled Squid was good, the sauce they used complemented the squid nicely, although I do prefer a more buttery flavour which this one lacks.  Aburi Nigiri was nicely displayed and they tasted very good!  Pirates Roll was also something I enjoyed and found interesting, something you can't really find elsewhere.  Tiramisu crepe cake was also well made, not too sweet and had a good texture.  I think the most unimpressed dish was properly the Oknomiyaki, although it had a lot of ingredients, but it lacked the taste which made this dish kind of plain.  Overall my friend and I had a great time catching up and we enjoyed the meal.  The prices are at the high end, but the decorations they put into making this place and the quality of the food they offer makes it reasonable.  If only they also serve alcohol (I think they are working on it), it would of been perfect!"}
{"text":"This review is for their dessert only. My disappointment when I realised Sansotei Markham does not serve Mille Crepe cake from Millie Creperie (only dt location has it) but I remember that Le Modern does..so I quickly headed over there and got my craving satisfy. Omg, so lucky to know there is a good place in Markham for Mille Crepe Cake. No need to travel so far to DT for this delicate dessert. I am really happy this place exists uptown. If you have never tried it, I highly recommend their Matcha Mille Crepe Cake or the Tiramisu version.  You don't need to necessary dine with them for sushi and can go there and order desserts only.   This is the best Mille Crepe Cake that I tasted. Can pretty much rival Millie Creperie Crepe Cake"}
{"text":"Recently came here on a whim for date night.  We were originally headed to a different Japanese restaurant but decided to try Le Modern at the last minute.  We don't regret our decision. We ordered the sashimi sampler - sashimi was really fresh and the portions are very generous. We also ordered the oshizushi set which came with 2 salmon, 2 saba, 2 white tiger shrimp, and 2 avocado. This reminded us very much of Jabistro, but slightly more affordable. Quality is good for the price that is being paid. Last thing we ordered was the pink dragon roll which was recommended to us by the server. The soft shell crab is delicious, though the asparagus flavor kind of overpowers the rest of the roll, but overall it's good.   The decor is nice and its quiet. The atmosphere is great and allows for good conversation. I would recommend this place and would most likely return for another visit."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 other friends for lunch today.  Servers were polite and did they're job. Not much I can complain or compliment.  The decoration was nice too, love the wood tables but the chairs weren't too comfortable as they look like cheap plastic chairs. One of the entrances were solid black color which I felt weird.  We ordered a sashimi set, veg tempura combo, short rib teriyaki combo and a Maki combo 7 (red dragon roll & green dragon roll).  Their menu is very limited, business lunch menu is served only at lunch time and dinner menu is served only during dinner which starts at 5pm. They do not have any other menu to order off of Which I felt that choices were very limited.  All of the combo comes with miso soup and salad. The soup was alright, nothing special as it tastes like the instant ones where you add water to a packaged powder where you can purchase at supermarkets. Salad was just cabbage with watery, diluted dressing which tasted like thousand island.  The mains were alright, nothing much to complain or compliment about, except that we got super thirsty after our meal which I believe they used too much MSG.   Overall it was a decent experience. But for the price charged for the food, there are plenty of other choices. I would not come back again just because it wasn't anything special that would attract me in terms of quality and price."}
{"text":"Le Modern Japanese Cuisine was okay - came here for lunch.  The place is nice and clean and it was pretty empty when I got here during the lunch hour.  We ordered: JAPANESE PAN FRIED UDON NOODLE (with beef) Really sweet! There's a lot of sauce (a little too much tbh) overall, I'll give this a 3/5.  CURRY CUTLET RICE (chicken) It comes with two slices of cutlet chicken - it's breaded thinly, which I prefer. Comes with rice and curry on the side - could use more of the curry! Overall I'll give this a 3/5."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. I have slightly higher standards for sushi so I may be a little biased but when I ordered the sashimi lunch the temperature was borderline thawing. Friend ordered the torched sushi which looked pretty good, but price is a little steep for what it is."}
{"text":"You'd think this place would be some hidden gem with its location. This place is beautifully decorated but acoustically terrible. You can hear every tables conversation but your own.  THE WAIT IS INCREDIBLY LONG. I'm actually still sitting at the restaurant waiting for the food. It took 26 mins for 1 roll (pirate roll) to come out and 35 for some grilled eggplant. The roll had uni in it but i couldn't taste it.  Both were tasty- but DEF not worth the wait.    The service is terrible, only one waitress knows what shes doing. Every time a dish comes out, they anxiously check their ipads to figure out which table ordered it.  40 mins in and i'm still starving, their excuse is that \"quality is put into the food\"... Which is total bullshit because there are some bomb places with fast service. Also because its mothers day they're \"incredibly busy\". This place is small 10 tables and only 6 are being used...  Anyways they began to rush and 12 mins later the lobster fantasy roll and bonito roll was here. Both kind of lack lustre.   When i went to pay, which my total was about $75 she gave me a $20 and change. I didn't bring my wallet and i wasnt about to give them a $20 tip. UGH so yes i ended up giving a shitty tip for their service which i feel bad about (which is why they have 2 stars and not 1).  Basically, if you're hungry or looking for something quick- DONT COME HERE."}
{"text":"Came here on Victoria Day, and it was quiet.  This place is hiding in the ground level of a business complex.  The decor is simple and modern; even the pictures are as simple as a \"circle\" painted on wood.  We started with yakinasu.  It's baked eggplant with sweet miso sauce.  It's delicious but too mushy.  It seemed like it had been overcooked a bit.  Then came the Nigiri platter, Angel roll, Private roll and Chirashi Don.  The first three were presented on tiles; big square for the platter and long rectangular for the rolls - simple and modern!  Everything here was fresh and tasty.  The best dish of the day was; the Pirate roll.  The roll melted in my mouth with the taste of uni lingered.  This \"pirate\" robbed all my taste buds.   Great attentive service!"}
{"text":"This review is for a lunch experience.  We came for lunch in a group of 8.  We ordered a variety of food from both the lunch menu and the regular menu.  As I only ate mine, I solicited opinions from others about their food.  I ordered a sushi set with California rolls ($14) from the lunch menu.  The quality of the raw fish and rice was good, and was on par with MiNe from across the street.  The fish slice of the nigiri sushi was thinner than I like.  For the maki, the protein to rice ratio was good.  Both nigiri sushi and maki rolls were loosely put together.  For the nigiri sushi, the fish slice seemed to be simply snapped on top of the rice.  The maki rolls kind of fell apart when picked up.  I rated the sushi set 3.5 stars, mainly due to the freshness.  A few friends also ordered some of maki combo lunches.  One said his rolls also came apart when picked up.  He said he would rate it 3 stars.    A friend ordered a sashimi set ($16) from the lunch menu.  The sashimi was thick, and the colour looked good.  She said the freshness was average.  She rated it 3.5 stars.  A friend ordered a don with beef short ribs.  She *loved* her don.  She said it was tasty, moist, had lot of meat and other ingredients.  She rated it 4 stars for quality and taste, plus 0.5 stars for the large portion.  And indeed, the don was big enough to feed a man of big appetite.  A friend ordered an inexpensive Osaka Okonomiyaki (pancake) from the dinner menu ($7).  It was big enough to serve as a lunch for a person of small appetite.  She rated it 3 stars.  The average score of the orders above is 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Been here twice now, and I can certainly say that this place is an underrated gem in Markham.  Le Modern is located on the ground floor of an office building, and has been open for about a year now. The inside is indicative of the new style Japanese restaurants (think JaBistro, Kinka, etc), but this place is a lot quieter than the well known establishments downtown.  The menu isn't very extensive, but the options are quite decent for a Japanese restaurant. The servers are Chinese, but the head chef in the kitchen is Japanese, so you know this place is authentic.  Some items I tried include the okonomiyaki, sashimi platter, angel roll, salmon oshizushi, tako wasabi, le hokkaido salad, grilled squid, miso black cod, lobster fantasy roll, and beef/pork skewers. Out of these, I highly recommend all the items except the okonomiyaki and beef skewers. The tako wasabi is extremely spicy as the wasabi stems in this dish is legit. The sashimi platter has decent variety, including bluefin tuna. Their pork skewers are also some of the juiciest I've ever tried.  This place also does catering for large parties, and I recently booked a 14 person party as part of my relatives from Hong Kong visiting the country. Their service is very good in terms of making sure everyone's appetites are satisfied.  Service is excellent, and personally I would rather visit Le Modern than similar restaurants in the area such as Tsuki."}
{"text":"As a big fan of Japanese food, I'm always looking for new restaurants to try. Le Modern was the next one for me to try. Nice minimalistic decorations and new to Markham, it's a new contender. This is a pretty long review... You've been warned!  Started off with the Tako Wasabi and it's one of the better ones I've had. It's not super slimy and doesn't have a fishy after taste. The spice level is right for me with a nice kick and they gave a generous amount of seaweed. For $4.50 this was worth it.  Chicken kaarage was OK. Didn't really seem like a Japanese style but it was still tasty. Batter was crispy and you get quite a few pieces. This will set you back $5.  Being a big fan of Shiso Tree's okonomiyaki fries, I had to try it here. For me, it doesn't compare. Shiso tree does it way better but the difference here is you get sweet potato fries. Still tastes good though and the sauce is a nice balance of sweet and sour. It is cheaper and smaller in portion here too for $5.  Next came the Salmon Oshizushi. This was a pressed salmon sushi topped with mayonnaise and salmon roe and then lightly torched. Presentation was nice and tasted great. I think the sushi could use a little less rice but that's not a big deal. 6 pieces will set you back another $15.  Tried one of their specialty rolls which was the Pirate Roll. Looks almost identical to the JaBistroll but taste missed the mark for me. I think this was just me as I don't really like the taste of Uni. This roll was made up of Uni, salmon, cucumber, snowshell crab topped with flying fish roe and torched spicy sauce. Worth a try but this was pretty expensive for $18.  Our last main dish was the Chirashi Don. The wasabi was real wasabi and not just paste. The fish was fresh but the selection was OK. It contained salmon, egg, tuna, tai and amberjack. $15 for this wasn't bad.  We finished up with the Tiramisu Crepe Cake as they ran out of the green tea one. The cake is multiple layers of crepe and tiramisu cream. Not too sweet at all. Must try for $8.  For a Monday night, they weren't that busy around 7pm. They had 5 tables and the one and only waitress held down the fort. Service was quick and food came out at a steady pace. Will definitely be coming back. Recommended!"}
{"text":"The menu has changed again for the better. They did bring back more sushi and sashimi options for lunch. I wanted the sashimi lunch set but was sold out (i went at 1, thats prob why). I tried the tempura curry lunch which was really good. They also sampled a new menu item for me. It was a salmon, lettuce and sesame dressing don topped with fried vermicelli noodles . It was quite refreshing especially for lunch menu item. It would be nice if they added some other types of fish to give it another type of flavour"}
{"text":"Came here for a spontaneous lunch. Walked in and the place was very modern and welcoming. The place is small, but feels cozy.  We came around 11:45 AM for lunch it was quiet at first, but once it hit 12 they got busy.  The kitchen was open so you can see the chefs working. The staff were very nice food came quick  I ordered the curry pork katsu it was around $12-13 add $2 for soup and salad it was nice and crispy, but curry was a bit bland   husband got the tuna set salmon rolls he said the fish was very fresh around $12 combo his came with soup and salad."}
{"text":"This review is based on my lunch experience at Le Modern Japanese Cuisine.  I did come here with a high expectation as my recent experience some of the newly opened Japanese restaurants has been quite good. But here at Le Modern everything is not up to par aside from the decoration.  Sushi Set ($14)    A good shari rice is the base and most important element of sushi. The rice should be of the same quality no matter it is prepared for lunch crowd which maybe less demanding or the dinner crowd which would expect more.  The shari rice here is a complete fail: dry, hard, and chewy. The rice has no connection with the fish in the nigri sushi. Basically it is just a rice ball with a piece of fish on top with no wasabi in the sushi. They were big in a bad way as they are not bite size and fell apart when I picked up with my chopsticks.  California Roll though huge but has the same issue. Mega roll that cannot fit in one bit?  Fish was dry aside from the Salmon. Fake Crab Meat that is rock hard? AYCE cheap wasabi?  Should I comment on the complimentary soup and salad? The portion though is huge but why are you putting a spoon in my miso soup? The salad dressing is so watery and have no flavour.  So basically the food they serving here is similar to AYCE quality.  Maybe dinner is better? I am not sure if I going to waste my money to have my modern Japanese food. If they use the same shari rice to made their sushi, how can it be better?  Such a shame as the decoration here is so nice but I cannot eat that."}
{"text":"Went here last week and was I ever disappointed.  The wait staff was okay. The food was not very good. Had the tempura lobster and it just tasted like fried soft dough mix with a familiar chinese spicy thousand island sauce. Just awful!  I also ordered the black cod. That wasn't very good either. The fish was hard and tasteless.  Also order a sashimi Platter which was un eventful. The tuna belly or whatever was very chewy. Honestly wasn't any better then an all you can eat. Also I ad an uni Maki. It didn't taste bad but it was again over sauced and you didn't really taste anything.   Overall food was below average.  We didn't order any drinks and the bill was 80 bucks. Not including tip.  It's too bad the place seemed very nice had a decent ambiance. Maybe if my bill was half the price I wouldn't of mind it as much.  But definitely not worth 80. I would rather spend my money at zen or Sushi Marché."}
