{"text":"This place is unassuming. From outside, it looks like a fast food sushi place. Hence, we've always passed it up. Today, we were walking up and down Yonge St. undecided on where to eat, and as it was freezing, we walked in here without expecting much. We walked in and were welcomed warmly by the server and the chef. The place was empty, but clean and though small it was warm and cozy.

I really thought this place was like those food court ones where food comes in black plastic containers, but wow was I wrong. The menu is pretty extensive and a mix of Japanese and Korean. 

The complimentary tea is better than average, and has a nutty roasted taste, which I liked. I ordered the Kalbi lunch special and at $7.95 it was an amazing deal. First of all, the kalbi was freshly cooked, juicy and tasted amazing. Seriously, well above the average kalbi in the area. It came with rice, jap chae glass noodles, age dashi tofu with teriyaki sauce and pickled cabbage. Everything was fresh and tasty. It also came with a tiny congee bowl, but the miso soup and salad was just ok. And to finish it came with a tiny orange cut up into bite size pieces. So I really got a bang for my buck. My bf got the bulgogi lunch special and it was also just as good.

The cherry on top though was when the sushi chef came to our table and offered us 2 complimentary California hand rolls! The service was already great, so this was just above and beyond.

I was really wowed with my first time experience here, and would highly recommended this place. I am excited to go back to try the sushi next time. I am currently forgoing sushi for lent. I am also looking forward to trying their delivery via just eat.ca =)"}
{"text":"I recently went to this restaurant with no expectations with my SO and was pleasantly surprised to receive stellar service and great tasting sushi.  I've had sushi all over TO and can honestly say this hidden gem is by far one of the best.  We were provided with great tasting appetizers and all our needs were attended to quickly and with a smile.  Highly recommend and will be returning there on a frequent basis."}
{"text":"Roll on In!!!! I just returned from my first visit and WOW, what a great restaurant. It is a small, modest, yet clean environment. The service was 5 star plus!!! The owners truly care about their customers, as evidenced by the friendly service, fresh food, and free appetizers. How lovely to be greeted with rice soup, glass noodles AND a cabbage salad...all for free!! The presentation of our order was remarkable, as was the quality of our meals. Following the meal, we received complimentary hand rolls and oranges to clean the pallet. What a great surprise!!! Please stop in, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"A very surprisingly good place to grab sushi in a casual, budget-friendly place! It has a simple, run-in-the-mill look from the outside, however, I have been consistently impressed. I have been here for both lunch and dinner - great value, excellent quality, wonderful service. 

1) Atmosphere - this place is very casual and laid back. It is not a dive by any means, but not exactly a place you come for a romantic birthday dinner...It's a great place to catch up with people - very low pressure, no one rushing you, affordable....

2) Great rice to filling portions - nothing annoys me more at sushi restaurants, than when I cannot even see the filling in my roll due to rice portions. The rolls are well constructed with fair filling portions. The sushi and sashimi are fresh and delicious. 

3) The service - EXCELLENT. The service is actually what pushed me to a five star - it is what made this place a stand out. The service was so friendly, attentive...quick refills on the tea! 

4) Value - great prices without compromising quality. 

Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I liked how the sushi were meticulously prepared, the portions were big and I was able to see the great quality from the ratio of sushi rice to the fish!  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I walked in here with no expectations. In the end, I was blown away. I went in for lunch, the menu was extensive but I stuck to the specials. It was fresh and the portion size was exceptional. I honestly couldn't ask for a better lunch that was priced so inexpensively."}
