{"text":"I could eat here every day. Sate Sub is inexpensive, fast and the ladies who work there are always nice! The sate beef sub is my FAVORITE. The meat is so well marinated and the sauce they put on the subs is excellent. I highly recommend the spicy sate sauce. The meat is so tender every time. The veggies they use are always super fresh, and they even ask if you want salt and pepper on the subs. It's about $6.50-7.50 for a sub, which is so inexpensive. I think they might be my favorite Vietnamese sub place in the city."}
{"text":"I'm actually not shocked this place has a high of a rating as what it does.
For what they do.. This is actually quite good.
Decent Price and Decent Food.
That's about it.

I've given this place 3/5 for a few reasons.
Yes, The food is Good and Reasonably Priced. But that's where it ends really.

I've been to Sate Sub a handful of times, but a few things really bother me.

Fact of the matter is - We're paying for a service that we can easily get from several other places in this area. 
I find the people that run this place outrageously rude. I usually don't mind people speaking in another language.. but they seem to take their customers hospitality for granted. The last few times I've gone.. I've found them being quite rude; Yelling.. Ignoring me. So the service here really brought it down from a 4.5 or even a 5 to a 3.

Another thing is the Hours. Monday to Friday 11-6.
Doesn't really work if you're working late, or having Weekend Cravings.

The food? It's great. I've only had the Subs - Based on the reviews I've read on here, I love the BBQ Pork Sub. Spicy and a Decent Portion.

The Spring Rolls could use a little work. The portion is tiny and I found that it doesn't have alot of filling. They also need to add more Fish Sauce, The portion their is tiny as well.

I will continue eating here as it is convenient for me, I will explore other options - but for now they have me Hook, Line and Sinker."}
{"text":"I went there for a bubble tea and it was totally worth it. Very good customer service as well. If you're in the area, stop by."}
{"text":"I always come here if I want cheap good food whenever I'm in downtown. I know the place is dilapidated as hell but when you're hungry it won't really matter, I love the fried roll that comes with vermicelli rice. Can't go wrong for less than 7 bucks. Don't bother with their bubble tea though."}
{"text":"Sate Sub's got a new wholewheat bread.  I always get the Sate Beef Sub - my favourite - fully loaded.  Yum!

The BBQ chicken noodle soup was delicious as per my mum.  Broth was very tasty."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to Spring Rolls and vietnamese subs, and I love bubble tea! Ever since the (apparent) unfortunate closure of the Black Pearl across the street, I'd found it hard to get a quick fix. So when I was told that Sate sub had excellent food and decent bubble tea, I had to check it out!

First of all, the food is super delicious. The spring rolls are crispy and fresh, the meat is good, and the vietnamese sub I've had so far was pretty damn tasty. Everything was super reasonably priced, and their deals were all very good. For under 10 (more like under 8) you can get a massive amount of food and a drink. 

The Bubble Tea is decent, but they only have pearls. They use frozen fruit, and once when I asked them to combine different flavours together for me they did it (although they asked me why, and seemed a little put out by my combination. But they did it no problem, which is what counts. What evs, it was super tasty). 

The restaurant itself is super tiny, and pretty crowded, although they've managed to squeeze in a couple tables. I don't think I would do a lunch date here, that's for sure. But the food is stand out, so it is definitely worth getting it to go."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I've only ever had okay experiences at Sate.  Having visited the place a couple of times for lunch, I can safely say it's not my favourite place to get a Vietnamese sub.

The first time I went I was assured that it would be the best food I've ever eaten, so I was super excited.  The excitement started to die down when I had to wait in line for close to 20 minutes before finally putting in my order, and another 10 until I finally received my food.  Perhaps they were having an off day, but, when you only have an hour lunch, 30 minutes is hardly enough time to eat your food and scurry back to work.  Instead of being able to enjoy it immediately, I had to take it back to work with me and eat at my desk... not as satisfying.  I'll admit that the sub was pretty good, but by the time I got it back to my office it had gone cold and the bread started to sog.  

The next time I went (a later lunch, I might add) it wasn't as busy, which was nice.  Sadly, however, the bread for my sub was extremely hard.  I was having difficulties biting into it and, once finished, the roof of my mouth was so raw and cut-up that even drinking water hurt it.  Not great!

It's too bad that I didn't have great experiences because other people rave about how good it is.  Sadly, I did not experience this and therefore can't deem it as one of my top choices for a good Viet. sub."}
