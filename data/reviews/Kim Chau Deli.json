{"text":"This place actually have been in business for a few months.  I believe they process meat and other food items in the back, but they only recently opened their retail storefront deli for its customers.  They sell Vietnamese Subs, bubble tea, and refrigerated Vietnamese meat items (beef/pork/chicken balls, hams, cold cut meat, meat pies, etc.).  I ordered their Beef Sub ($5+GST) and went back to the office to eat it since there is no seating area.  The sub was delicious and packed with veggies (see picture).  This will likely be my new go to place for Vietnamese subs in the area!"}
{"text":"The Banh Mi here is pretty authentic and for $5 it's a lunch choice winner. The meat is flavorful and they give you a generous spread of pâté which makes a banh mi great in my opinion. They also have a banh mi competitor a few doors down which I think is expensive and taste is mediocre. I highly recommend this hidden gem in the far corner of the shopping plaza.   Also if you're familiar with Vietnamese food, this is a deli that caters to the busy Vietnamese families that don't have the time to prep or cook regularly. Everything is pre-made so all you have to do is go home and heat it up or cook it. If you're new to Vietnamese cooking then simply ask the nice girls at the deli for instruction on how to cook it and what to pair it with. For someone who don't cook often this is the perfect place to go without missing the taste from home."}
{"text":"Went in for bubble tea. I ordered a sub and my wife shopped in their pre-made stuff. I ordered a sub and my wife said no she was fine.. needless to say she took one bite and \"allowed\" me 2\" of my sub..(which was much bigger). Food good. Friendly staff and a nice selection of Asian foods. And bubble tea was good. Or so I was told by my son... yep got nothing. Lol. Will go back without them."}
{"text":"I don't know if the lady who helped us was in a rush or not, but she gave us a whole chunk that was uncut- piece of vietnamese meat... and a big chunk of carrot too. not little strips of carrots. it was horrible."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing an advert in the newspaper. Good parking, and their storefront is well stocked. Thought there would be low stock as I came late on a Sunday night, but was pleasantly surprised by the selection that remained in the dessert section. Picked up a few of my favorites like dessert tofu and coconut rice pudding with beans. Also got a try an interesting drink that had a variety of herbs and longan fruit (maybe it was a sweet soup?), and a 3 bean dessert. Their items were very well packaged, and no leaking occurred on the trip home. Prices are superb for what you're getting. Would come back again for their desserts and Vietnamese style meats!"}
{"text":"This location has great price points for subs at $5, the subs here aren't mind blowing, but for the price? Hard to complain!!!"}
