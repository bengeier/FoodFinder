{"text":"Lived in the area for over 3 years and I've just discovered the best bagel I've ever tasted. The owner is friendly and the food is fresh. Will definitely be coming back again and again. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Good bagels. Lots of options. Pleasant staff. Terrible muffins... skip those. But the bagels are good."}
{"text":"This place makes very authentic NY bagels. I grew up on this stuff living in the NYC suburbs - and they definitely satisfy my craving for a taste of home. They have a great chewy crust on the outside and are super soft but dense on the inside. I have been to a number of well rated places in TO and this is absolutely the most authentic NY style bagel. I went in the morning on a Sunday and everything was still piping hot which was the best. The storefront is little but I was only there to grab a few and go. Service was prompt and very cordial.  I'll definitely be back up there for a re-supply."}
{"text":"Had a New Years brunch and Bubby's Bagels provided the food. Delicious bagels and really great dairy platters (cream cheese, egg, and tuna scoops). Food was fresh and beautifully presented. Service was great and excellent communication."}
{"text":"Bagels are alright, just a different style than the one we like from Nu Bugel in Kensington."}
{"text":"I am obsessed w this place! Best kosher bagels to ever hit Toronto!!!!! Great fast service. Tons of bagel options and more. Try the chocolate chip bagel, buttered w eggs! Yummmm! They are on uber eats too."}
