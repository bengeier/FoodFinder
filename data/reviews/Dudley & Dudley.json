{"text":"Chaleureux mini café-épicerie. Delicioso! Le proprio nous accueil comme à la maison. Un des meilleurs café du Plateau."}
{"text":"Thank you for the consistently excellent, robust coffee made with a true passion and a friendly smile every time. I can only describe it as rich, nutty, creamy,  chocolaty, smooth, with the right amount of kick. As for the desserts, locally made and just what a sweet tooth desires, perfect compliment to a warm cup of coffee. This little corner coffee shop is a CONSISTENTLY good experience!"}
{"text":"It's a bit out of the way this coffeeshop. British flag everywhere inside. Very rustic and English decor. The owner has his grandmother's adorable tea set. It's the tiniest place... smaller than my closet.   The owner is super friendly.   I read in the Yelp reviews that their coffees are very strong, so I asked him to make something lighter for me. He made me a cappuccino... despite two sugars in; it was still very strong.   The place has so much stuff (oil, sugar, all imported) it's like a small boutique too.   Unfortunately, the shop does not take debit or credit card. I find it very inconvenient since, people barely carry cash these days."}
{"text":"Dudley and Dudley is a great cafe with really wonderful, friendly owners. They speak both english and french, so it's comfortable talking to them, both for me, who can speak french, and my boyfriend, who only speaks english.  I don't drink coffee, so I haven't tried any of theirs, but at least once during the weekend I stop in for a sandwich and something sweet. Their sandwiches are generally around 8 or 9 dollars, I think the price varies depending on the ingredients, but they are absolutely amazing, and are very different from the usual sliced meat and cheese on a baguette. I'm talking porchetta between two slices of focacia with artichoke type of amazing. As far as sweets, they have french and italian viennoiseries as well as traditional cookies and muffins, and I've enjoyed everything I've tried so far.  If you're ever on the corner of Gilford and Chambord, do stop in, you won't be disappointed."}

{"text":"Dudley & Dudley is a brand new, stylish café that just opened this week on the cozy, quaint Gilford, tucked in behind Mont Royal. I had a chance to drop in today for a coffee and treat and speak a bit to the owner(s). They're a local couple who noticed something missing in the neighbourhood and decided to fill the gap. I've been watching the renovations happening for weeks, anticipating opening day! This spot really is the perfect little café, with a couple of window seats and a bistro table, a beautiful wooden bar at the side to sit at, and is chock-full of specialty foods and treats to choose from. We decided to get our coffee to go, because the buzz around this place is big in the neighbourhood right now and it was a packed house! But, I've got my eye on that window table and will be back to linger longer next time. It is small inside, so not necessarily a place to go with your laptop but maybe once the din dies down a bit, it might be possible! Coffee? EXCELLENT. Rich and delicious, not too acidic, perfectly made to order. Their beans are from Faro Roasting Houses, which is a new name to me, but I was really pleased with the taste. There's a wall of bagged beans for sale, which I'll pick up the next time I'm in. They have the almond milk alternative for peeps like me who try to avoid dairy.  Yeah... I say I try to avoid dairy, BUT those creamy donuts are to die for - we had a pistachio custard donut which was iced with the lemon and sugar classic Quebec topping (which I've only had on crepes before), and we also went for a chocolate mousse ball which was seriously inhaled in about half a second. I could have easily eaten a dozen of them.  Great vibes all around - everyone's excited to see this new addition to the 'hood. I hope they'll be around for a good, long time. I know I'll be frequenting the place regularly to do my part to support such a cute, classy, friendly place. I'd have given five stars now, but I'm reserving that fifth star for when I go back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Dudley and Dudley is considered a locavore-central gourmet shop that offers a triple goodie offering sensation: a lunch counter, a cafe, and a general-type of store.  There are handmade fresh sandwiches, using seasonal ingredients; salads, doughnuts, pastries, as well as a full coffee bar using fair-trade Faro beans.  Located in a former hair salon, the owner, Francois Berthiaume, was super pleasant and welcoming.  The hubs and I were waiting for a dinner reservation a few blocks away, and Dudley & Dudley was a wonderful refuge to pass some time and to seek some warmth from the cold.  I had their Latte, which was not bitter at all - had the right amount of deep flavoring of the roasted beans; you have the option to add some maple syrup, which I highly recommend!  Great alternative than sugar and/or cream! The hubs enjoyed a panini sandwich, with grilled chicken, cheese, paprika mayo, and bok choy - the bread was super crispy from the panini press, and the sandwich itself was light and was a perfect afternoon snack.  There's extremely limited seating, as there are 2 armchairs by the window, and 4 chairs by the glass counter.  If you're one of the 2 couples in there, it is okay; however, more people can cause some slight claustrophobia.  Definitely check this little gem of a place out!  +serves fair-trade Faro coffee +fresh seasonal sandwiches +ask for Monsieur Francois :D +extremely limited seating +free wi-fi"}
{"text":"VERY STRONG COFFEE. It will burn a hole in your stomach lining / clean your plumbing if you know what I mean. The americano almost burst my eyeballs. Couldn't finish it. If you like it stiff, enjoy! The best part about this spot is the delightful owner behind the bar. They've got a deadly selection of great pastries. Super small 4-seater so don't expect to park that tush."}
{"text":"Dudley & Dudley is a gem and a wonderful find. Our macchiato and cappuccino were excellent. Many reviews mention the coffee as almost too strong, which is surprising, since there were perfectly balanced shots. The coffee was probably the best we had in the neighborhood. Our kids loved the large bottle of chocolate milk we brought back and we liked the small curated selection of random items (Marvis toothpaste and maple syrup). The pastries, which are likely provided by another vendor, were good, but not great. I will definitely go back for another macchiato!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the dictionary definition of a neighborhood coffee place this is it. I passed near this place on my way to work a few times and always told myself I need to stop here. Today I said this is the day, stopped my bike and went for a coffee. The coffee was very nice, strong and bold the croissant looked good but I am afraid it was mediocre. You could still feel the butter but the crispiness was a little off and also the general form of the croissant. Sorry for talking about it so much but for me a coffee place is judged by 3 criteria's A. Coffee (this is a coffee place) and this place got the A+ B. Pastries  (I usually go with a croissant) and it got a B or even B- C. Atmosphere and this place ROCKS! it got an A+++++ for that and if you go there you immediately see way and I dont want to spoil you the surprise :)"}
