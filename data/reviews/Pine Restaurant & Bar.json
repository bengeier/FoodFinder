{"text":"This used to be a nice little NeighborHood Bar.    They added on a second floor in order to add an additional Banquet Room for Parties & other Special Occasions.

Due to a lack of business now only the Bar is open to patrons and both dining rooms are only available for special occasions.

I think it one of the Nicer restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Used to be much better, but now they've closed down the restaurant completely and it's just a bar on weekends with almost no menu."}
{"text":"I had various reasons to celebrate on Friday, and have wanted to make a point to go back to the Pine Restaurant for a formal review all week. What better time to gather up a few friends and make my way out to Kennedy Township for a try?

Why review The Pine? Last Sunday's TRASH meeting was held at The Pine. I checked out the web site beforehand, and, at first glance, it's not clear what to expect. The menu lists all the basics for a casual dining establishment (appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, etc), but the execution of that menu could have gone either way. Once I arrived, I found that they're making a point to connect with the craft beer enthusiasts of the world through somewhat impressive selections both on tap and in bottles. That scores big bonus points on my end. Even more interesting: they're just getting started and the owners are actively pushing to get the word out. That's exactly the class of restaurateur that this site looks to highlight.
