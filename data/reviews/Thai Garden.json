{"text":"Have been going to this restaurant ever since it opened. We go once a month for our thai fix for pick up or dine in. Owner is very nice and always comes and say hi. Yeah the other staff can be odd at time, but it is part of the experience. The lynch buffet on Thursday an Friday is a good way to sample their offerings."}
{"text":"I've eaten here more than once, and never had a problem.  The prices are reasonable, the portions are plenty. The menu has a variety of options. The food is sinfully delicious. Service is good, but I always notice the restaurant is empty...."}
{"text":"We have eaten there a few times but mostly do take out and always very good. We usually get Pad Thai,  Mango salad is so good, coconut rice and spring rolls and  time for the first time we tried General Tao and it was excellent.  The restaurant is a bit dated but don't let that turn you away, the food is really excellent."}
{"text":"Take out - take out - take out - Prob the best Thai in Ajax.  If you eat inside its the usual strip-mall non ambiance (but lots of people take out from this place).  Good pad-thai (I found it authentic and not like some places that is like spicy ketchup) Spring rolls - crispy and not greasy (nice crunch and taste) comes with generic sweet spicy sauce which is nothing to write home about  Basil Tofu - tasted good Tom yum - spicy enough to enjoy the authenticity of Thai cuisine Vietnamese Rolls - fresh - crunchy - tasty  It is most definitely a takeout joint.  I have been there inside to eat - but not really a place to go that has ambiance."}
{"text":"I eat here weekly, when I try new things it's always usually pretty good the only part that bothers me about this place is that they canceled the lunch buffet which was like eight or nine dollars Thursday and Friday."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Ajax/Pickering. I've been ordering takeout for a couple years and always a great experience.   My favorites are cashew chicken and cold rolls. Although the dinner for two that includes pad thai is great as well and reasonably priced.   One gentleman that I see there is very friendly and even has learned my special requests by heart. Another employee is OK,  but a little quirky.  Overall highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a dying Chinese place.  I can't say it's a thai place, because the thai food really stinks. the Chinese is better but not even that good.  Maybe I'm comparing it to Markham places, but I'm not going here again.  The service is ok.  I'll let non-asians eat here and let them keep this place running."}
{"text":"My friend said this was her go to place when she feels like Thai food.. We decided to head over and order our food for take out. The gentleman behind the counter provide great service. I ordered the Chili chicken and my friend ordered the cashew nut chicken. We also decided to share the Thai cold rolls. (which I have never tried before) and they were delicious. I could not believe my eyes when we arrived back to her place and saw the portion size.. I definitely had left overs the next day and it tasted just as good. Another good point which i didn't know at the time of ordering was the fact that this is a Halal Hakka Restaurant. Now a days living in a very multicultural society it is good to please all types of nations."}
