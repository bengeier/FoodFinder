{"text":"Just moved here from New York, Was very impressed with the home-style cooking. Plan on bringing the entire family here very soon. Thanks East 74."}
{"text":"The meat and vegetables offering is a little disappointing.  They have roast beef which is unfortunately dry and served with a canned, gelatinous dark gravy.  If you are southern or if your mother ever made homemade chicken and dumplings, you should avoid this dish when it is offered.  The dumplings are heavy, thick and chewy and the whole dish is sauced with an obviously canned white gelatinous gravy.  For a place that tries to offer southern style food I don't understand why they don't make their own gravy for these dishes.  I also found small chicken bones in my dish which is a big turn off, not to mention perilous.  The vegetables they serve either come out of a can or are frozen.  They are not well seasoned.  Various members of family and extended family populate the staff.  I asked my waitress what they recommend on the menu -- the family members that are waitresses can never tell you!  The ones I have asked have always replied that they don't eat southern food!  It's obvious most of their food comes from a can or the freezer.  Never again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch yesterday as I was driving in the area and wanted something local. Unobtrusive diner at the corner of 74 & Indian Trail looked busy. Stopped in and sat at the bar to get my bearings. I sat for about 2 minutes and watched the waitress pass me by until I figured out the system. There's a diner bar area along with booths and tables throughout the restaurant. You walk in and there's one cash register with a large old-time menu board above the food area. Most items are around $5-6, and they includes sides. I got up (moved over 3 seats) and ordered from the cash register. Given a table top number and told it would be a few minutes.   I went with a special on the grease board. BBQ plate for $5.95. This came with 2 sides and a roll. I ordered a drink for another $1.25. My two sides were mac & cheese and mashed potatoes. Food came out on a paper plate with BBQ sauce already on. Flavor of all items was good (not great). My only issue with the BBQ is I had a small bone I had to take out of my mouth...not fun, but made it through none the less. All-in-all...OK and less than $10!"}
