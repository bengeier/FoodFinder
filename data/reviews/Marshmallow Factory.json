{"text":"My daughter awaited the opening of this place anxiously for what seemed like forever! As we drove by one day last summer my little girl spotted the door open and begged me to go in. To put it bluntly and as honestly as I can my NINE year old  wasn't impressed! The anticipation that grew waiting for the 'Marshmallow Factory' to open fizzled away as to both our amazement they didn't even offer freshly made marshmallows! Instead they offer marshmallow cream, (think marshmallow fluff you can buy at just about any grocery store) and an assortment of mass produced vessels such as cookie cups and cones that you can eat the marshmallow fluff out of. The place also sells very over priced marshmallow confectionary imported from the UK.   If you're looking for freshly made organic marshmallows or anything FRESH you should probably skip this place.   If its expensive unique imported candy you seek just walk a few blocks to Sugar Mountain or Suckers!   My daughter and I both were very disappointed."}
{"text":"I think the people writing these angsty negative reviews about this place should Mallow out a bit. They're overly marsh. I mean harsh.  This place is super cute. Yes it's expensive but it's Toronto and specifically Danforth St, so that's a given. I think people are annoyed because they don't really sell marshmallows per se, but Marshhmallow cream. It's really delicious though, and a very unique and interesting and original type of store, unlike any I've been in before or since. I think they mostly deal with sending stuff all over North America. The prices keep me from awarding a 5, but this is easily a 4 for originality and deliciousness.  Maybe people are forgetting to factory in how yummy it is."}
{"text":"I thought the place looked fun and all but I was disappointed with what I actually got. The \"marshmallow\" looked nor tasted nothing like marshmallows. I liked my chocolate toppings and my sugar cone but it wasn't anything special. It was very small for such an expensive price. I love marshmallows and I think this business would do better if they actually had a \"fluffed\" marshmallow maker instead of just goo in some container."}
