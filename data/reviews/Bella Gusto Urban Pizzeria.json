{"text":"Went in for dinner based on the stellar Yelp reviews. Although it was slow on a hot Sunday evening, there were a few folks at the bar. Our waitress was extremely attentive answering all our questions & providing recommendations. Ended up going with a Gusto BB salad & a brunch blast pizza. The salad came out immediately and was simple & perfect. Greens, balsamic & a little shaved Parmesan. Excellent. Right after, our pie was served with kale, sausage, potatoes, mozzarella & serranos. The chiles provided a nice hint of heat while truffle oil rounded out the flavor. And the pizza dough was chewy & perfectly cooked in their wood-fired oven. Altogether, I would go back in a heartbeat for pizza, appetizers & ambiance. Definitely a great new place to try in Chandler!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  Great food, great price. Started with the calamari and was delighted.  My wife commented that it was super light,  she ate more than me!. Ordered the Tuscan Village pizza and was not disappointed.  Incredible crust,  fabulous red sauce, real mozzarella,  and perfect sausage with roasted grape tomatoes. Loved it. Had the Brownie with Coffee gelato and Espresso for dessert. I can't wait to  make this myself.  Needless to say, i can't wait to get  back there and try some more creations!"}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZAS! I preder their \"white\" over \"red\" but still, you can't go wrong. Gnocchi was great, Lemonina gelato was great, service was great, everything was great! I just hope that the business picks up a little as the location isn't the best for this kind of business (it was very quiet on a weekday night)."}
{"text":"Wow where to begin! This place is awesome. The food was so fresh and delicious. The Chef/Owner even made me Cacio e Pepe (look it up, it's so delicious!!!) even though it was no longer on their menu which I think was so awesome of him. He even came by our table to see how we were doing which I believe is a sign of a great restaurant. Their pizza and dessert was so good. I think I found my new favorite restaurant :). You definitely need to come visit Bella Gusto - you will fall in love with this place like we have!!!!"}
{"text":"I recommend this place, just recently open and still working out some kinks but the pizza made up for it! Good to see the owner working the customers and being hands on as much as he was, hopefully he keeps it up. One major flaw... Waiter never checked on me to ask how everything was til I flagged him down for check.  Will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"They have Shiner Bock on tap and simply beautiful food .. They are doing Mario B. and Bobby Flay proud!!!"}
{"text":"Best neopolitan pizza in the east valley. Mary Margherita is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great service! Amazing food! My wife and I stumbled onto this little gem. We had the Tuscan Pizza and the Italian Chop salad. The ingredients were all very fresh and flavorful. The manager said almost everything is made by scratch and it shows.   This is a great date night spot. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews are from friends of the owners. The pizza is soggy and they all taste the same. The service is horrible! Witness one of the owners take food out to a table and place it at the end of the table instead of serving the guest. Never seen anything like this. The owners run around the restaurant like a chicken with his head cut off yet they are never busy. Decor is dark and depressing. These guys won't last more than six months already see signs they are out of money. Owners are Corporate want be chefs they are copying a pizza joint in Texas."}
{"text":"Neapolitan pizza here is fantastic. I think it's more comfortable than sitting in Pomo or waiting for Pizzeria Bianco, and frankly, I think the pizza is better than either of them. The menu is focused which allows them to focus on what's good. We have a perfectly good Caesar salad for starters. I've had the margherita, which is what must be eaten to see how the rest of the menu will fare (very good); I've had the Sicilian, which has crispy, spicy sopressata, sliced meatballs, and a deliciously aromatic herb ricotta base. We've also enjoyed the appropriately named Flavortown, with its combination of truffle oil, mushroom, sopressata, mozzarella, all balanced by sweet caramelized onion. Bella Gusto will receive my repeated return business."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was great. This place makes its own cheese and other ingredients.  You can tell they care about the food. We got the burrata appetizer and the Tuscan Pizza. Probably the best pizza in the area. The service was good. They have a pretty good selection of beer and wine. We will be going back to this place fairly regularly."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood pizza joint!  Very interesting combinations of flavors on their pies.  All wood fired!  House made mozzarella and burrata - both are delicious.  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza and chicken Marsala! Inside could be setup better but will go back for good food and services! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Ranks up there with the best pizza I've had in Phoenix.  Wood fired light crust with simple fresh ingredients that are delicious. Make their own mozzarella in house.  The kind of pizza you get in Italy !  This guy could teach Chris Bianco how to make great pizza.  If you haven't tried this place...you will never know what you're missing.  Andiamo. (Let's go)"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed.. We read the reviews on yelp before we decided to eat at Bella Gustos. Seeing that the restaurant had 4.5 Stars we were very excited to try it. My husband order the Gnocchi Bolognese which was subpar. He said it had no flavor and would not recommend it to anyone. I ordered the Nobile Chicken Parmesan which was good. The over all experience was 3 stars at best and definitely not 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Very good. Awesome service by Courtney started with Chop Salad- there were 3 of us and we didn't ask it to be split- came out in 3 bowls-chef thought it would be easier-YES! Then had the Burrata - apricot mustard, wilted kale and balsamic with rustic Italian bread- MUST have! and Viva Roma pizza- ham, olives, artichokes and mushrooms- perfectly done and flavorful.  Add a couple of craft beers and a gelato to top it off! Highly recommend. Extremely reasonable prices with high quality food and service! #golocal #nochain"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza I've had  outside of NYC. I've been there 3 times in 3 weeks. The pizzas are terrific! We have had 5 different pizza offerings, and there were no disappointments. The desserts are at the same level of flavor. This is my new go to pizza place."}
{"text":"This is where we ate lunch today for Easter...weird, right? But I'm so glad we did! The house bruschetta was amazing! So perfect and yummy. Excellent service! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great Neapolitan pizza and a much greater value than its famous counterpart in Phoenix. Parking is ample and free, pizza is 30% larger with lots of toppings, prices are 25% less, and restaurant is usually large enough with little waiting. Also great specials and Happy Hour. The owners are visible and friendly as are the wait staff. Best of all, the pizza is cooked perfectly with a little crunchiness and chewiness on the edges."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Triple Threat is scrumptious. The Phoenix salad was fresh, crisp, dressed deliciously light. Pass on the sangria, though. The wait staff is attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"Excellent Restaurant in Chandler neighbourhood. This place make fabulous food!! The Chicken Marsala is delicious... l highly recommend this dish. If pizza is your thing the flavortown is excellent. Bruschetta was great and the calamari was good too. We also had the beet salad and we all enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Came in to meet friends on Friday night. The place is beautifully decorated,  and the oven is fun. However, for the look, they should have chosen a more appropriate music (walked in hearing Black Sabbath),  and the music was so loud we had a hard time hearing each other. I started with the salad with the pickled onions and sweet balsamic vinaigrette and it was one of the best salads I've ever tasted! I so enjoyed it! I ordered the fungi pizza. It came out too soon...I was still enjoying my salad. The mushrooms were tasty, but the dough was gooey in the middle. The edge crust was crispy and good.  Once we paid the bill our server disappeared so it was impossible to ask for any more water. Was I impressed? Eh. Will I come back? Perhaps..."}
{"text":"These pies are delicious! They make everything in house, including their own cheeses. The pies take under two minutes in the oven and they are unique in a good way. If we lived closer, we would take out here regularly. Great ambience for dining in as well. Staff is attentive. Owners are dedicated."}
{"text":"I tried this new place out in my neighborhood and was more than surprised by the amazing array of selections the two owners put together. After taking forever to decide what to get, we started with the housemate burratta. I have never tasted anything so delicious. The kale salad under it just enhanced the experience. We had to try the pizza so we went with the tradition margarita pizza. Once again I was blown away by how good everything was. From the perfect crust to the perfect amount of sauce and cheese, I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I had very high expectations of this restaurant after reading all of the positive reviews it's received.  Our experience started off very well.   We were warmly and enthusiastically greeted as we entered the restaurant.  We were immediately seated at a table along a wall with a large screen for a projection tv, which seemed more appropriate for a sports bar than an Italian restaurant.  The music (70's rock and pop) was also more fitting for a sports bar than Italian restaurant.  Keeping with that theme, our server's uniform/outfit more resembled sports bar attire than Italian restaurant garb.. There seems to be somewhat of an identity crisis going on here; do they want to be known as a sports bar that serves upscale Italian food, or an Italian restaurant serving upscale food?  That's a question for the management to ponder.   Moving onto the dining experience, it was very hit and miss; much more miss than hit. Our server was very pleasant and friendly, but apparently she was not properly trained. To that point, we ordered a bottle of wine to begin.  After opening the wine, she immediately put the cork back into the bottle! No taste, no pour.  We then ordered a Caesar salad to share.  That came out quickly, but without any serving utensils. We made do, using our dinner forks as our serving forks..There was also no offer of fresh cracked black pepper.  Oddly there was no salt and pepper on any of the tables (are we not allowed to season our food if we wish to?).  On the bright side, the salad itself was good, with fresh lettuce and a nice  flavor.     Onto our entrees; the Gnocchi and a Prosciutto Arugula pizza.  The gnocchi melted in your mouth, however the Bolognese sauce was missing something in the flavor department,   The pizza was VERY disappointing,  The crust was extremely soggy and greasy, with little to no flavor.  The pizza toppings also had little to no flavor. The prosciutto, arugula and shaved parmesan were very fresh, but lacked the flavor I was expecting.  Instead of going to flavortown, we were taken to Bland Land. Some salt, pepper and crushed red pepper would have been nice to attempt to resuscitate any hint of flavor from this pizza and the Bolognese sauce.   Overall, this was a very disappointing dining experience. I had such high hopes for this place, but unfortunately it fell flat.  I gave it 2 stars because the servers were pleasant and welcoming, but they couldn't outshine the disappointing food we were served. Pizzeria Bianco has nothing to worry about."}
{"text":"This place is my FAVORITE... I lovvvvvvvve the meat and cheese board. I can eat that all day every day. I just wish there was a half portion! Don't matter tho I will keep coming and I will keep eating it! And then for dessert, NUTTELLA CHEESECAKE!!! What!?! So good"}
{"text":"Authentic wood-fired pizza comes to Chandler!  Went in today for a late lunch with mom. We shared the Italian Chop salad and the Tuscan Village pizza. Both were simple and delicious, with fresh and unique ingredients you won't find in many local Chandler eateries. I only wish we'd had a larger party so we could have tried a sandwich and pasta dish as well!  After our meal, Matt (one of the owners, trained under the likes of Batali and Flay!) came over to check on us and chat a bit. He and his partner are loving the area and are really getting involved in charity and scholastic causes. I will most certainly be back here soon and wouldn't be surprised to see lines out the door come fall!  :)"}
{"text":"So delicious!  Caesar salad with cranberries was fantastic, they even added extra garlic for me.  Had the meatball pizza, so amazing.  Fresh, high quality ingredients.  And the Special K dessert  pie with roasted pears...again, just amazing.  Excellent service, clean and hip restaurant with a very cool pizza oven!  Will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The food is great!!! And the service is second to none. Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza... if you go on a day other than Tuesday, the wine is quite expensive, but Tuesday is pizza and wine day.  1 large pizza and a bottle of wine for $22 or something in that price range. Would recommend to anyone looking for some great wood fired pizzs."}
{"text":"Our family have been to Bella's at least once a week since we moved in the area in July 2016... Our daughter goes to Chandler Preparatory Academy which is across the street from Bella's. ..They hire staff from collage and high school. ..We know all their staff  and they are all very pleasant to talk to and service is always great. ..Bella also is a sponsor to my daughters school. They are very community involved. ..Now to the food, I haven't had anything on the menu that I haven't loved...All fresh , they make their own mozzarella and cure their meats...pasta is also made there....We were in Italy last summer and Bella Gusto is the closest to real italian pizza we have found in  the Phoenix area. ..The only thing bad I can say about Bella Gusta's pizza is we can't and don't want to eat anyone else's pizza...When we do we are always comparing others pizza to Bella's. ..So I highly recommend stopping in and taste for you self you won't be sorry..."}
{"text":"This place was terrific! The employees were so kind, helpful and patient (3 kids).  Food was delicious and nearly everything is made i house from scratch, including the pasta and mozzarella. My kids wanted to order so much because there were so many choices of dishes to eat.  Chef Matt (trained under Mario Batali) stopped by to check on everything, chatted with us and gave us his background and vision.  We definitely recommend this place for everyone wanting some fresh, and delicious food."}
{"text":"There are not enough words to describe how amazing this place is. From the outside it looks like it might be a little dingy but when you walk inside, wow! I had the chicken parmesan sandwich with Parmesan French friends and oh my Lord was it good. I could only eat half because I was saving up for dessert but I think it was even better today! Amazing service! We had a younger man, very urban and hip, I would go back just to talk with him. We had the tiramisu for dessert, oh my goodness was it good. It had a slight hint of lemon which just highlighted the creamy mascarpone. I'll be back next weekend most definitely!"}
{"text":"Great! Loved caprese salad and pizza. Pesto sauce is yummy. Can't wait to go back. Service was wonderful too. Cute place!"}
{"text":"We can't believe we didn't know this place was here!! Amazing gourmet wood fired pizzas- we tried the prosciutto and arugula pizza and GOAT pizza.  Both were amazing but the sausage on the GOAT pizza was pretty outstanding.  Our kids had the spaghetti and meatballs which were equally amazing.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The sauces are zesty and fresh, the mozzarella is made in-house, and they have Shiner on tap! The bruschetta was simply fantastic. The Arizona Sunset cocktail could not be beat and the Bella Gusto Mule had just the right balance. I highly recommend delighting your taste buds and visit this spot. Seriously great music, too."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here a few times. This is the best pizza I've ever had! They also have some other really tasty dishes like Chicken Marsala and The Cowboy is amazing but you have to come taste for yourself! Be sure to try the Red Sangria it's the best! Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"great food, great service... you will love it here! came on Father's day. They have rely good service and the place is really clean... the food is great and the price is right."}
{"text":"received a coupon in the mail & had lunch today.  was told they opened a few months ago. the place was empty at noon. my wife and i ordered each a pasta dish. the entree came with nada - not even bread. i ordered some bread for $4.00 and it was merely some over cooked pizza dough. the pasta was ok - they need to offer something  more for me too return!!"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza for take out. I chose the Fungi -- and the brunch pizza the one with kale / Italian sausage and serranos and potato. I thought the fungi pizza was bland even though the menu said it had truffle oil which I adore - the brunch pizza which was pretty flavorful was a better choice. If I go back I'd choose to order in and have a wine or a beer and see how the food actually is when it comes fresh to the table. I can't really say how good it is based off of the take out I received.It was a bit cold and probably doesn't do them justice. I'll be going back in to give them another try."}
{"text":"Best Artisan pizza in this neck of the woods. other menu items were great too (squash slices/calamari/salads) just a solid place! Do it..."}
{"text":"Uncooked pizza dough. Disgusting. And when I called to complain about my takeout order, I was told the pizza dough is supposed to be chewy and every other excuse under the sun. Don't bother, eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"We conversed here for our department holiday lunch today.  Ten of us independently ordered 10 different items -- just happened that way -- and each of us bragged about our order.  That's quite a statement!"}
{"text":"I went here on opening night, a Tuesday, with a coworker and my husband. They had a special on Tuesday night: any pizza with a select bottle of wine for $22. Checking into Yelp also netted me a free foccacia ($4). I selected the funghi (mushrooms, mozzerella, truffle oil with red sauce, $14) and added spicy soppressatta (+$2) to it. I chose a lovely Barbera  called Maraia, which usually goes for $32 a bottle.   The bread was warm and crisp and chewy; the top of it was sprinkled with sea salt. It was served a nice herbaceous olive oil. I had to stop myself from filling up on it!  The pizza was fragrant with the truffle oil. The mushrooms were fresh cremini - yum! The pizza is delicious! The crust is thin, chewy, and crispy. I'm not sure if it qualifies as Neopolitan, but it certainly is that style.   The wine was quite lively and complimented the spicy and earthy flavors of the pizza.  We shared a tiramisu ($5) as a treat. It was tasty, not authentic but I'm not sorry I ordered it. It was a decent sized portion, and easily satisfied my husband and me.  Service was efficient and friendly. My pizza came out with the added soppressata, and it was remade quickly and correctly.   In short: I'm glad I came, and I can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"I have only had the pizza but that was great.   I've eaten here 4 to 5 times and still continue to enjoy it.   I have it 4 stars because i had one pie that was a bit burned on the bottom.   A result of how they are cooked so sometimes it is tough to gauge readiness.   Still prefer it to typical pizza ovens."}
{"text":"Very good Neopolitan style pizza.  We had the Fungi and the Margherita.  Both had excellent flavor.  We came a few minutes after opening so there was very little wait.  The only downer was that the crust tasted a bit too \"burnt\" and was blackened too much in spots as if it should have been taken out of the oven a little earlier.  Despite this we'll still give it another try the next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered out and were very impressed with the pizzas we got! The crust was perfect and the toppings were delicious! I guess I should have taken a photo of our food before we started eating because it went super fast! I highly recommend giving this brand new establishment a try."}
{"text":"I'm from Chandler, and I love this place. It's the best brick oven place around. Honorable mention to that Bashas with the brick oven south of here. From the moment you get out of your car in the parking lot you can smell the wood burning. That just makes me more hungry! I really like their pepperoni, and meaty pizzas. All of the others I've tried have been very good as well. They use top quality ingredients, and you can taste the difference. They have some deals during the week that are attractive. While they don't deliver themselves, they are partnered up with one of the online delivery apps. I have not used that tho. I really think this place should be enjoyed in person.  If you've never had brick oven pizza before, then you gotta try it! It's the best pizza you can get."}
{"text":"Amazing brick oven pizza! I ordered a pepperoni pizza with ricotta and also the chicken Marsala. Both were delicious and the kids enjoyed the food as well."}
{"text":"My first time here and everything was perfect. The service was great, the energy, the smell and of course the food. I will definitely be back! We tried the mushroom pizza sub vegan cheese (cashew cheese from 24 carrots) and it was amazing. I usually wait a couple times before rating but this place was so bomb I had to share."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband and two friends. Ordered the burrata (excellent!!! I highly recommend it!) and the bruscheta (ok) to start with. Then 3 of us ordered pizzas and really really enjoyed them (i got the Flavortown with spicy sopressata..yum!). My friend got the margharita pizza and devoured all of it. The only reason I removed one star was because my husband's carbonara pasta was not that impressive and came a whole 15 minutes before our pizzas; he decided to be considerate and wait for our food to come before he started eating his pasta (since it was supposed to come shortly) and ended up having it cold (might be a reason why it was not impressive!). Great new place in Chandler! Try it!"}
{"text":"We showed up right as they opened.  Ordered pizza, great flavor. Wood Wired, Actual wood fired oven. Staff was great. Friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. The pizza crust is the best I've ever had in AZ...and that's coming from a Chicago guy. The best way to describe this food is \"taste explosion!\" The flavor combos are ridiculous. This place is tucked back in the corner of the open air mall. After dinner and desert, grab a coffee at SoZo!  Bonus tip: try the happy hour sliders!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I started off with the Roma Caesar and Italian Chop salads and split the Sicilian Rossa. We both agreed it was of the best Neapolitan style pizzas we've ever had. It was perfectly spicy with high quality ingredients and authentic deliciousness! I hope this place stays in business because we were the only patrons there at 5:30 on a Saturday. It's not very visible from the street, and that may be the reason why. I would've never known about this place if didn't come across my Yelp feed. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Place is simple and understated but food is solid. I like simple pizzas (thinner and flexible dough) which is not over-sauced or seasoned which overpower the flavors of the ingredients. You get that at Bella Gusto, dough that is flavorful with quality ingredients on top. Simple but delicious! Have also tried their gnocchi which was well done with sauce that was well balanced and a spread of ricotta and arugula. Good job Bella Gusto, will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday evening craving some pizza! It was my first time here and was pleasantly surprised by its trendy and modern ambiance. I liked that they have half-sized portions for salads and pastas because it will prevent me from over stuffing myself. We started with a Phoenix Salad (comprised of: spring Mix, orange Segments, goat cheese, candied walnuts, cranberry vinaigrette) which was really tasty. Next came the Cacio e Pepe pasta with brown butter sauce which was absolutely flavorful and so good! Of course we had pizza, we ordered the veggie supreme (San Marzano sauce, fresh basil, fresh mozz, roasted mushrooms, artichokes, zucchini, tomato jam, pickled red onion). The pizza was just a solid ok. It was really runny, probably from the tomatoes. I tried the pepperoni pizza to see if it had the same consistency and also found it to be a little runny as well. I will definitely come back to give the pizza another shot!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent as well as the atmosphere. Their pasta is the best I've had in a long time and the Pasta Pomodoro was great. However the service was poor, slow and erratic. Needs to improve to match the food."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here. I LOVE pizza so I was excited to try a new place. I wasn't disappointed. Bella Gusto produced a delicious wood fired pizza. The atmosphere was interesting... kinda that dark, Italian mob feel... not sure if that added to the charm or hurt. Point is, I'll definitely be visiting again soon and bringing more friends with me."}
{"text":"How have we not been here before? I really like this place and so do a lot of others apparently as it gets full pretty quick. Wood oven pizza is always the best and this place does it well. Good service, good food, good prices. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience all around. Will likely not return.   I know it's difficult to run a restaurant that is only 1 week old, but it needs to be better than I experienced today.   After reading a blog about new restaurants in town, visiting the website and yelp reviews, my coworkers and I decided to give this a try. The website promised $2 off all beers (as of writing this review the incorrect info is still on the site). It was the deciding factor that drove us to visit. When we arrived they said \"oh that's not true. We are changing that on the website right now\"... Ok, honest mistake but the site still says it. Maybe the cool thing would be to honor the mistake for our first beers and save the first impression? Nope. Thanks for making your problem my problem.   Yelp check-in got us a free focaccia bread, which had a nice flavor but was drenched in salt. The whipped lard it was served with only added to the unnecessary saltiness.   Wait staff was odd, and seemed to hover. We were the only table for a while, so again it's understandable. They're still learning the menu, and recommendations were rocky. They asked lots of questions about how we liked the food. I appreciate the concern but 5x across 3 people was too much. I just said it was good to get them to move on.   At one point the owner stopped by to say hi and inquire about the meal. We again told the story of how we were mislead by the website. Rather than do anything about it he blamed their \"PR company, based in NY\" which did nothing to pacify my concern. He was nice though and shared his optimism about how the pizza shop should be a slam dunk in such an opportunity rich restaurant market.   We got the Tripple P (tasty but not amazing - bacon was tough and the big chunks of goat cheese overwhelmed), Brunch Blast (loaded with savory flavor and an occasional \"blast\" of spice from a Serrano, this felt like a flavor identity crisis), & Mary Margherita (traditional, classic, a touch too cheesy Marg).   I hope they work the kinks out, but in the meantime they've burned some of their local working professional lunchtime customers. With ownership having such an apparent restaurant pedigree, I was surprised by the apparent misjudged experience they provided us. Best of luck!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Bella Gusto!  The atmosphere was warm and inviting. The staff was very accommodating to requests and very attentive to their tables. The meatballs were amazing!  As well as the pizza!  Delicious!  We will be back to try dinner. Best of luck to Bella Gusto!  Chandler needs a new and great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I enjoy wood-fired pizza so I was excited to see Bella Gusto in Chandler! The restaurant has a pretty casual atmosphere. They offer both beer & wine selections, have TVs with sports games playing (basketball on the night we went), and they definitely have good food.  It was my fiancé and me for dinner; we got the House Bread (free with Yelp check-in), Italian Chop Salad, & Prosciutto Arugula pizza to share. The House Bread didn't take too long to come out. It was fresh and tasted good with the herbs & dipping olive oil. Overall, a nice treat on the house!  Our salad & pizza came out shortly after and both looked really good. I sometimes have to ask for extra dressing for salads, however the amount of balsamic they had put on this one was perfect. Not sure exactly why, but the salami tasted a little bit off and the chickpeas weren't as crunchy as expected. I'm not sure if I'd get that particular salad again but it was okay.  The pizza we chose lived up to expectations. The dough was really the star. It was soft & fluffy throughout and the crust was a bit thicker & more doughy. There was a good amount of cheese, arugula, & prosciutto on the actual pizza as well. I had picked this one because it had a garlic oil base instead of regular tomato sauce and was happy to find that it wasn't super garlic-y. Overall, I would get it again.  We noticed a board outside which said they have happy hour and also reverse happy hour. The dessert choices (tiramisu, sticky toffee cake, etc) sounded impressive as well, so next time we will save room for one of those!"}
{"text":"Best Neopolitan pizza in Chandler, hands down. I hope they relocate to have nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I went back for lunch and grabbed the chop salad to go along with another focaccia since it's free with check in :) The salad didn't have an overpowering flavor but I didn't think it was bland, I thought it was delicious. My only complaint was the lack of salami. When I first dug into the salad I thought they forgot it. I picked through and found five little slivers (think chiffonade) of salami.  If I'm ordering a chop salad I'm expecting a balance of meat cheese, and veggies. The cheese was great and much more of a generous portion. I would only order the chop salad again if the meat portion matched the cheese portion."}
{"text":"Pizza on point! Super chill staff, food is fresh and tasty, ample parking, beverages are a strong pour for sure!  This is my first time here for dinner and I will be back to try out the lunch menu"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with fresh ingredients. Nothing better than wood fired pizza. Everyone was very nice and the guys at the pizza oven give you a big wave and thank you when leaving."}
{"text":"Really really excellent wood fired pizza...maybe a tad spendy, but definitely worth it! Salads are delish also....forgot to try the Cannolis....I'll remember next time...check it out, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"We are so happy we found this secret gem in our neighborhood! We just love the authentic brick oven pizza and just recently discovered their paninis! Yum! Can't wait to try out their limoncello flight soon."}
{"text":"After a long day of car shopping with my mom, we decided to try this place out since it was super close to my house and driving far for food was NOT an option. Along with us came my younger sister, my son and boyfriend. We ordered 4 appetizers; the Peasant Bread, Bruschetta, calamari and burrata. Let's start with the peasant bread; it was free with our Yelp check in, the texture on the outside was lightly crisp and the inside, just the right amount of doughy awesomeness! It came piping hot to the table and literally let out steam when we poked it (my 8 year old son really enjoyed that) I didn't care for the herb oil that was served along the side, it was kinda bland; as an Italian from NY, I would've like to see a red gravy along the side (maybe have it as an option?) The calamari was DELISH. I've had it at a lot of different places in Arizona and everyone seems to over cook it, making it a rubbery mess -not this calamari, lightly breaded and deep fried, served over some marinara AND its gluten-free (not that I prefer gluten free, but ya know, for those of you that do) to die for! The bruschetta was excellent; not that tiny piece of bread with a stack of soggy tomatoes that most places serve, but with a thinly shaved piece of prosciutto topped with arugula tossed in a vinaigrette with a touch of honey! Lastly, for the appetizers, the burrata. SO.FUCKING.GOOD. I could have eaten just that and left happy.   For entrees, we ordered spaghetti and meatballs, pepperoni with spicy soppressata, the Triple P and the Gusto Bolognese. I know what you are all thinking, you have 5 people at your table and all of that?? Take it easy! We are Italian and from NY, we do it big when it comes to food! I absolutely loved the Triple P, sweet and savory at the same time..who would've thought to put a fig on a pizza!? I tell ya, I was about to put a ring on it! That's how much I loved it! The two pasta dishes were good, nothing outstanding to say, but I will say one thing, I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Good service the pepperoni pizza is on point with a lil spice that's perfect. Calamari is my wife's favorite.  Get a side of the calamari sauce for the bread you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing PB&J desert pizza. You must try it. Super flavor on all the food from the unique wood stove. Waitresses are always super polite and attentive. Keep it up"}
{"text":"I loved this place!!!! YUMMMMMM and they have the coolest oven ive ever seen!!!"}
{"text":"A bottle of merlot and a wood fired pizza for $22.00.  A great deal!  Pulled up the bottle online and it was worth $18.00.  Both wine and pizza were excellent.  Had the fried eggplant appetizer.Very tasty."}
{"text":"Best place ever! Very authentic. Staff super nice and friendly. I come here once a week! Totally recomend this place."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the strip mall but it definitely deserves the search. It's a great neighborhood pizzeria with great brick oven pizzas. The sauce is great, the crust is great, and the ingredients are great. The house red blend is one of my favorite wines (especially during happy hour). They don't have a million beers on tap, they have a few taps and they're all solid beers. This place does it right, they give you just enough choices to make sure you can find something you like and that they can make sure everything they do is really high quality. It's the Goldielocks of neighborhood pizzerias."}
{"text":"I had one of those days at work yesterday that made me want to just grab my husband and my dog and head to the nearest beach and stay there for a week or two.  But since that's not an option, I grabbed my husband and headed to the nearest joint that I knew would have some good wine.  We were greeted and seated right away and I appreciated the fact that the hostess didn't just pile us in close to the other tables to make it easier for the server.  A little space was nice and needed last night.  We each started with a glass of the house red wine, which is a Sangiovese blend.  One of my favorite types of wine and one of my favorite Italian words to say.  Also, try \"Montepulciano\".  That's a great word to say out loud too.  I thought the wine was $6 a glass, which was fine, but when we got the check it was $4 HH pricing.  Even better.  It's a nice blend with a woody, slightly cherry, smooth finish.  Perfect with our meal.  We shared the small Italian chop salad ($6) to start, no onions.  When our server, Brittany, brought it out, she noticed right away there were onions on the salad and returned it to the kitchen.  Good call.  I did not feel like 'urping up onions all night.  The salad was nice and fresh and the fried chickpeas are an interesting and tasty touch.  Oh the pizza.  Oh it was great.  Trust me.  We had a hard time choosing but went with the Tuscan village ($14) with sausage, fresh mozz, cherry toms, and fresh basil.  Just perfection.  This is a pizza that normally we would have to drive 25, 30 miles into north Phoenix or Scottsdale for.  Delicious sausage, and it's tough to ever beat fresh mozzarella on a pizza.  And what the wood oven does to cherry tomatoes is amazing.  It was the best meal we've had in a long time.    After tax, before tip, our total was $30.18.  I've already decided that when we go back, we're getting a bottle of chianti and trying a couple more of the pizzas.  And then I'm sure a big nap afterwards.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"This place has seriously good food. The Tuscan Village Pizza is among the best I have ever tasted.. They make their bread for sandwiches in the wood fired oven, and it really makes a difference. The service is very good as well. I would recommend this place to any pizza snob like myself."}
{"text":"The place was busy on Friday night but we were greeted quickly. They had to clear a table but moved at light speed to get it done! The wood burning pizza oven is the center piece and is bustling with activity. The food was great! We had their homemade bread, a pizza Mary Margarita, and a four cheese blanco. All were delicious! Very enjoyable with good service!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Pizza was absolutely delicious. I would definitely come back and can't wait till I do."}
{"text":"John (owner) makes some of the best pizza you will ever put in your mouth! Such a great switch up from the usual boring recipes you find at carry-out spots. Vibe from everyone working there is so chill and you can tell they truly care about customers! Burrata and sopresatta will have you hooked after one visit!"}
{"text":"really yummy food! The house baked bread was amazing! Light and airy with a little crackle of salt, served with tasty olive oil.  The salad we got was substantial for a large and the dressing was not too heavy. Very  fresh ingredients.  We both love the fried eggplant served with soft cheese and marinara sauce.  The atmosphere is OK. A little dark for lunch but I'm sure that dinner would have a different feel. They had two projectors and screens which led me to believe that they might show videos perhaps."}
{"text":"Just got a take out order from here and was thoroughly  shocked as to how this place has good reviews. First off we called in our order and was confused as to how a pizza place only has one size pizza?! Whatever it's only two of us and not a big deal, but then the lady on the phone says it will be done in 5 minutes?! This is where the red flags start flying. I don't understand how it's fresh made to order in 5 minutes, but whatever we will give it a chance. So we get there 6 minutes after we called, and there is our pizza just on the counter already in a box with nothing keeping it warm. Still we think let's just try it. So we open the box and we are met with one of the greasiest pizzas I have ever seen. I picked up a slice and all of the toppings just slipped off and revealed a nice underdone crust. Still I took a bite and was overwhelmed by the amount of basil and a very generic sauce with really no flavor. I don't know how this place can call itself a pizzeria and serve me this disgrace."}
{"text":"I liked the fungi pizza. The ingredient was fresh. Dough was perfect. And the wooden smell of the oven made it just perfect."}
{"text":"Very pleasurable experience. Food was very good. Place wss clean but staffed a bit light I thot. Not a fan of time floors in restaurants, noisy. But again, GOOD FOOD."}
{"text":"Good pizza, love the oven, one of a kind. Pizza crust is perfect. Every time I visit the place it's packed with more people, which is a good problem to have but they might need to add another  waiter. One suggestion, place use a different brand of sausage on the Tuscany pizza, the sausage topping on that pizza is tasteless"}
{"text":"Glad we tried this place for dinner. The calamari appetizer was absolutely delicious! The fried pepperoncini added a nice spicy crunch. The marinara in the calamari dish is house made and we ate every last bit with the Rosemary house bread.  We tried the Tuscan Village pizza and it was ok. I prefer thin crust pizza and larger pieces of sausage (theirs is ground). The house salad was plain but flavorful (pine nuts would've been a perfect addition). We had the house made tiramisu for dessert and it was good. Definitely coming back for the calamari and bread and to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great pizza with really fresh ingredients.  Loved their Phoenix salad.  Hubby and I were able to share salad and one pizza.    Crust is thin but not burnt and still chewy.  Located in a strip mall in an average area but I thought the inside décor and atmosphere was nice.  Even had a small private room for a private dinner.   Servers were friendly.   A little bit out of our way as we live in South Gilbert but would recommend you give Bella Gusto a try."}
{"text":"I brought my teenage daughter and niece here for a late dinner.  They were in the mood for pizza and pasta.  I'm a total pizza snob.  After reviewing the menu they had several questions trying to find an entree that would satisfy their young palettes.  Our server was extremely patient and served us well.  I had the Diablo pizza, my picky niece had the pepperoni pizza and my daughter ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  Everything was fabulous.  We also had calamari and gelato."}
{"text":"A very quaint wood-fired oven pizza spot in northern Chandler.  I didnt know what to expect for Mothers day.  But in honor of our Mothers they held an all day Happy Hour for Mimosas and Sangria.  We arrived with a reservation for 6:30 and had to wait just a little bit for the table to be prepared and were seated promptly with friendly service.   We ordered the Bruschetta, sadly they only have one kind it was a pesto with cherry tomatoes, and it was scrumptious, which is the reason I was so sad because they could certainly prepare another delicious variety.  Our waitress explained the specials and we chose to split a pizza and their special meatball lasagna. Although I missed taking a full photo of the meatball lasagna it was just perfect.  I'm not a ricotta fan, in fact the less the better and if we hadn't split it amongst the three of us someone would have had seconds to take home.  We also ordered the Sicilian Pizza and the crust was thin just how I enjoy ."}
{"text":"Delicious wood fired pizza tucked away in a quiet strip center end space.  Try their house bread- comes out looking like a beautiful slab barely charred pillow of bread drizzled with herby olive oil and salt. If you know a vegan, they have the most delicious vegan homemade cheese option for your pizza. I challenge you to tell the difference!"}
{"text":"Had the focciata for an appetizer which was served with an herb oil that was super yummy,, cooked in their woodfire oven. It was $10 for pizza on Wednesday, we got the four cheese pizza that was cooked perfectly! I've found in a lot of wood fire ovens the quality can be non consistent but that was not the case with Bella Gustos. Service was good, she was very friendly I just don't think I got her name. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I ate at this new restaurant yesterday, and was happily surprised at how GREAT the food was. And how wonderfully warm and inviting rhe staff and the restaurant are. A great new place to go."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended and it definitely didn't disappoint! From the homemade pasta to the wood fire pizza, everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some amazing oven fired pizza you need to try this place! It's fairly new but boy is it good. Our favorite is the triple-P pizza. It has some of my favorite flavors combined onto one delicious pizza.   Try it! You just gotta."}
{"text":"Love love love this place and the wonderful food, people, and close vicinity to my apartment! From the minute we arrived, we felt welcome. We made reservations, super easy to do, for the earliest my second half could make it from work, at 2015. Late dinner, I know, but this is Arizona and doesn't everyone eat late and go out late to beat the heat? Anyhow. We found there were plenty of tables available, though I'm not sad I made the reservation (100 points on open table!), I would have been very sad had they been too busy and I hadn't had a reservation.   So, the food. The bottle of local beer was ice cold and tasty and on special, so you can't beat that. The Cesar salad was scrumptious and fresh. But the pizza, the pizza! Yummy! Having just eaten the last of it, the taste is fresh on my palate. We got one bianca (white) and one rossa (red) sauced pizza, the Sicilian and the Triple P. Both were equal in taste, it's the chewy wood oven baked crust!, but I'd have to say the bianca was my fave. The meatballs on the rossa I'd say could be better, which is why it doesn't beat out the flavors in the bianca. The sweet fig jam, the salty savory goat cheese, the peppery arugula, and all pulls together with the earthiness of the shrooms. DELISH! Then to top it all off, they gave us a taste of the tiramisu! The proverbial icing on the cake. So perfect was the evening.   Thank you Bella Gusto!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem is a correct description of this place.  We read the good reviews, we love local business, so we decided to check it out. Pretty empty for a Saturday night, us and maybe 4 other people, the staff was Uber friendly and we chatted with one of the owners behind the bar. They only have beer and wine, but they do have a full liquor license, which I think is a waste. As a customer, I would of drank a shot of whiskey with my IPA's and my wife would of drank a couple Martini's. Instead we each had 2 drinks. I had the pasta.....it was ok. I wasn't really studying the menu, and didn't know there was a small and large portion I could of ordered, so when my tiny bowl of pasta came out, I was a little taken back. It was gone in about 5-6 bites. Wife had a salad, which was perfect for her. I ended up ordering a BOMB ASS PIZZA though. Get the pepperoni, and have them explain the origin of the pepperoni.....cool story.  Love the wood fire pizza oven, one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. We'll be back for sure. We wish them the best. Put more liquor behind the bar!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly on the food delivery and meal. I ordered through Yelp's delivery app and ordered a pepperoni pizza, Flavortown pizza, Caprese pannini, and Cesar salad. Our food arrived on time, and I had a bottle of Sangria on hand that paired well with our order.   The wood fired pizza crust is delicious, not too crisp, not too doughy, just right! Definitely an upgrade from Domino's or Pizza Hut. The panini size was generous, and the mozarella was fresh. I love anything pesto. My only gripe was the toppings on the pepperoni pizza seemed skimpy and I feel like there was a flavor missing from the panini. Overall, I liked it, and look forward to sampling other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing. Had their night special, Pizza and bottle of wine for $22. Had the caprese salad with Margarita pizza.  Wood fired pizza perfect. A must if you like real pizza."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Northeast, where Italian food was a mainstay and some of best food I have ever had. Bella Gusto doesn't come anywhere near making real Italian food!  The pizza was like paper, sauce was running off the pizza faster then I could eat It, it didn't even taste like it was cooked! Plus only one size??  Salad dressing was too strong and I nearly couldn't eat it. Plus they need to learn how to make real antipasto salad. In my opinion this is a trendy restaurant for those that have not experienced real italian food. If I known that the pizza was made the way they did it, I would have stopped at Nello's or Barro's pizza located on the same street. Like they say you near know until you try it, I have and I pass for a second time!"}
{"text":"So on a whim for lunch my husband and I said \"lets give it a try\" best choice ever. We had the wood fired Tuscan Village pizza and we split a Gusto BB salad. Oh and we had a couple glasses of wine a riesling wine that I wished I had written the name down.  Well needless to say we loved it !!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Easily the best wood fired pizza in Chandler, and comparable (or better than Pizzeria Bianco. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am not going to focus on the food or service on this review because they are both 5 star and others have commented well on these topics. While Matt and John understand food very well, they don't understand ambiance. Here were my observations. 1) location is not good, in a strip mall with a 99cent store is not a good sign.  While I'm sure they got a smoking deal on rent they don't need 5000 + sq ft. 2) When I walked up I first noticed benches made of cinder blocks and treated lumber (first impression) 3) The second thing I noticed was a large empty banquet room followed by a huge open restaurant with one couple eating. (second impression was this is not a very popular restaurant) 4) Walked in to be seated in the huge dining area looking at a sea of empty tables.  5) Decor was a strange mix (industrial black pipe lighting fixtures with Italian mosaic tile oven, Asian inspired chairs and modern tables and large 18\" Arizona ceramic tiles.) 6) Lighting was harsh from the multitude of Edison bulbs and track spots that were aimed at me. 7) I noticed cleaning supplies and brooms/mops leaning against the wall near the bar. 8) Also noticed a stack of empty pizza boxes stacked by the oven (like what you would expect to see at Papa John's 9) Ceiling was 2x4 suspended tiles painted black. 10) Artwork was too small and made the room look even bigger. 11) Room was reverberant because of the abundance of hard ceramic tile.  Here's what I would suggest: 1) Try to partition the room and create smaller spaces/nooks more intimate 2) Use rugs to breakup the tile and reduce ambient noise 3) remove suspended ceiling tile and leave the grid up then hang some pendant lights,  4) Get larger artwork 5) Close off the banquet room so it is not visible from the outside. 6) Clean up boxes and cleaning supplies. 7) Improve the cash area the shelves look out of place and the hanging t-shirts don't fit in.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Real Carbonara is a treat!  Wood fired pie was tasty with spicy pepperoni.  The Barrata was fresh and sweet.  The waitstaff was friendly, the pizza chef was cordial and caring.... Go? yes! Local places are hard to find and they beat the chains by a mile."}
{"text":"Vegans, listen up. This place is INCREDIBLE. Great vegan pie with local 24 Carrot Cashew Cheese. Our server, Kat was amazing-super fast, friendly, attentive. The place itself is nice and clean and smells of a well prepared sauce and that classic brick oven smell. The ambience is right, the playlist was really good-the perfect soundtrack to a perfect meal. I will definitely be a regular here! Thanks Bella Gusto, it's been a minute since I've had such a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Everything we have had here has been amazing. Highly recommended. We came in on a Sunday and they have happy hour ALL DAY. $5 Dollar apps and $3 mimosas. Me and my girl come here on dates it's an awesome atmosphere and the staff is great!!"}
{"text":"I got the Blanco Four Cheese pizza and it was really good. I'm excited there in Chandler with there really good thin crust pizzas. The manager Matt was very pleasant as well and told us about their fancy pizza oven they have that cooks the pizza in 2 minis"}
{"text":"So far one of the best and authentic Italian style pizza in Arizona that I've had.  And the free rosemary bread they give upon checking in on yelp is amazing as well.  Service was spot on.  We will be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood place!  They have great specials throughout the week and we went on a Wednesday for the $10 pizza, a salad, and the fried mozzarella. They have a nice happy hour as well with drink and appetizer specials. Food was really tasty and the service was nice as well. We will be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"First time here, the appitizer's are awesome, everything made by hand and fresh.  Highly recommend you try the sausage pizza and chocolate cake with coffee ice cream with expresso poured over! Wow!"}
{"text":"Good food and decent portions. I had the flavor town pizza with truffle oil and it's very tasty.  Staff is capable and friendly with good smiles. Definitely return again."}
{"text":"Terrific service . Restaurant  is very clean and nice decor. The food was amazing . I had the Sicilian pizza and it was cooked perfectly in the wood fired oven and the sauce was perfect and everything tasted fresh. The bread was great with the olive oil as well . Price point was perfect for quality of food. My waitress was great"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Their House Bread is a MUST and is the most amazing bread I've ever had.  (It's what I picture eating in Italy).  The Sangria is yummy. Their homemade pastas and pizzas are delicious and the Sticky Toffee cake is worth saving room for.  If you happen to be there over the weekend, get the El Diablo pizza.  If you like spicy, it is just that.  So flavorful!  Couldn't recommend them more."}
{"text":"Beautiful taste (bella gusto in Italian) is so true! Tucked away in a shopping plaza this place has a bland store front however once walking through the doors you are in an open room with a brick oven, a nice sized bar and lots of tables and chairs. A couple of large screen tvs and what looks like to be a private dining room. NICE! The aroma reminded me of Sunday dinners at my grandmothers. The menu had a lot of options and since it's made fresh, you can pretty much design you own meal. Our server had the entire restaurant at lunch this day. She was doing quite well except for some \"campers\" at the back table. Our pizzas were delish and thin. Not too thin, like a Matzah cracker but thin enough to not take over the flavor of the toppings and sauce. I ordered the white pizza and didn't even think about it but I should have asked for an olive oil / garlic base. The toppings were just on the dough. Even the garlic. Kind of looked focaccia with cheese. Mental note for next time. Their pizza sauce was light but had a lot of flavor. A little basil in that sauce and you might be the best sauce in town in my book!  I did note that the oven could have been scrapped some before out pizza was put in the adorable roundish brick oven. Some burnt flower on the bottom is something I've become used to when it comes with good pizza. Although we were not there for happy hour, CHECK IT OUT! It looked like they had great deals"}
{"text":"Ok, first, heads up, the FIRST Wednesday of each month is $10.00 pizza! Happened to stop in after soccer last night, we've been wanting to try Bella Gusto for a few weeks. We ordered the caprese app and two small salads (Italian Chop & Gusto BB) all of which were just amazing! The tomatoes with the caprese were delicious and they used yellow and red which is beautiful to look at... We ordered the Sicilian and Four Cheese (all white) pizzas. Honestly there was barely anything left! We crushed those pizzas because they were delicious! It's also very neat that you can sit right by the huge pizza oven and watch the chef prepare your pizza, like tossing the dough (don't try at home). We will be back. I think date night is Tuesday - bottle of wine and pizza for $22.00. You can't beat their specials, especially when it's all made from scratch with fresh ingredients. MANJA!"}
{"text":"Really happy we found this Restaurant!! Yum ! Great food Tasty!!  We a Sausage pizza as Appetizer and to try We all agreed The best !   I had Chick Parm sandwich very good husband had meatballs spaghetti and meatballs very good the kids had the sausage panini loved it and one had chicken marsala which was delicious portions are large prices are decent we love that we had a restaurant.com coupon we wouldn't known about it otherwise delish!!!! delicioso!!!   At the end of center Alma School & Warner.  Not a full bar but wine And beer available didn't have room for dessert I'll go next time we're going to save for the tiramisu"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Authentic!  The burrata was amazing.  I actually liked it more than the mozzarella.  Everything is made from scratch, in house.  So glad they are local because good pizza is hard to find in AZ.  We had the Fungi.  Can hardly wait to try their Tiramisu. Find this hidden gem and go enjoy a pizza and Red Sangria."}
{"text":"I thought it was about time to give BG a try yesterday when the pizza urge hit me.  Great reviews, impressive numbers, can lead to great disappointment or ecstatic agreement!  Unfortunately, I do not think they make the best pizza ever.  Good yes, great no.  The crust could have been baked another 20 to 30 seconds to get a crisper yet still chewy crust.  I ordered a Viva Roma Pizza that had ham on it that had an \"off\" taste and toppings overall were skimpy, a 3 star pizza.  Staff were very friendly, the restaurant is attractive and clean.  I did takeout.  Will try to eat in next time and try their pasta."}
{"text":"This was highly-recommended to us by a coworker, so we ended up visiting for lunch.  It wasn't very crowded when we were there.  The ambiance is fine.  Nothing special. Pretty typical pizza place these days.  The pizza oven is the dominant feature of the decor.    We ordered several items including pizza.  The gnocchi was good.  The pasta Bolognese was pretty good.  I didn't really like the pizza.  My wife and coworkers did.  I thought it was \"just OK\".  Not really bad, but nothing to write home about.  But -full disclosure- I was in the minority on that point at our table.  Without the pizza I might be able to go 4-stars on this one.  Service was good.  Food seemed fresh.  And I did like the non-pizza items.  I could be convinced to try their pizza one more time."}
{"text":"We got the Burrata, Caprese, Viva Roma Pizza and the Meaty pizza... AMAZING! The Burrata is one of the best I've had across the country. This owners Matt and John are extremely knowledgable and passionate, you can tell by the food. Highly recommend this place if you are in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I had stopped in a week or so ago because I noticed a sign for them so I decided lets check this place out!!! SO I was greeted at the door and seated my server was David who was a kind and knowledgeable young man.  I am happy he allowed me to pepper him with so many questions about the place.  I like to know what a restaurant is all about.  So I started out with a glass of wine and ordered their Sicilian House pizza and watched in cooked in a Italian stone oven which the temp reaches 1000 degrees with mesquite and oak wood.  Wonderful and then took pics so I can send to my husband who said \"enjoy\" but I knew he so wanted to be here to \"enjoy\" the experience with me.  No worries husband leftovers will be coming home!!!  I then tried their Tiramisu which was SOOO GOOD!!!  As a surprise I ordered the Cacio de Pepe pasta for a surprise for my husband's following days lunch.  He loved it and again he thru out there he would really like to go and eat at Bella Gusto's.  Well we did that today and we enjoyed ourselves ...everything we ate was very good but I worked really hard to keep room open to try another dessert. Sticky Toffee Pudding Cake with Vanilla Gelato...love it too.  I like cheesecake at italian restaurants but something different for desserts is so needed. But if I couldn't make anymore room to eat I have a motto \" if your too full it's okay to take dessert to GO\"!!!  I forgot to mention they make almost everything from scratch and I love when restaurants actually COOK ...from scratch!  So check them out!"}
{"text":"I don't normally start with their service but in this case they deserve it, they had excellent service. The salad was loaded with goat cheese, mandarins and walnuts and was great. Now the pizza. I ordered a marguerite uncut like always:) It was good and I would definitely go back, however they have no buffalo mozzarella and the mozzarella they did provide (a real thin layer) was not quite enough for my liking. The crust was good but not amazing. The flavor was excellent. I would recommend this place and will gladly go back for a second experience!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time.  Great staff, very attentive and a nice atmosphere.  Was expecting it to be busier.  Waitress was great!  Ordered an off menu item as they had the ingredients so why not.  Had chicken Parmesan with hand made spaghetti.  Fair price.  Be prepared for fresh noodles as most people expect a processed noodle and they are quite different.  The chicken as good but the breading was a bit over cooked - crispy.  But great overall.  Caesar salad had homemade croutons and the dressing was very good.  I ordered a pizza to go so I could try it out too as they looked delicious and they have a great wood fired oven.  Nice place, I hope people get wind of it."}
{"text":"Great pizza, style of Italy, similar to pizzeria Bianco downtown without all the BS. Wood fired, had the house bread excellent. Started with Fried Rice balls in a spicy marinara with sherry.  Fried Calamari was light and tasty. They were shooting some show when we were there so they had to turn off music and TVs which was wired. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Best Italian in the valley.  Homemade pasta, wood fired pizza are the best.  Excellent wine selection."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the finest food in Chandler. My favorite is the flavortown pizza!  My wife loves the pizza that has white sauce with fig jam and arugula plus other things (I love that one too).  Calamari and house bread apps are worth it.  The gnocchi with veal sauce is very good. And don't forget the sticky toffee cake. Yumm. Only thing we were less than impressed with was the Elvis pizza dessert. Go support this place!!! They've earned it"}
{"text":"We had dinner there tonight and it was delicious! We had the house bread which is cooked in the wood ovens. Then I had the small serving of the Pasta Pomodoro and my sweetie had the small Spaghetti and Meatballs. The smaller servings are the absolute perfect size for a dinner that does not leave you stuffed."}
{"text":"I went in with high hopes, because Neapolitan style pizza is my absolute favorite and the competitors do it extremely well here in the valley. I have to say, I was disappointed. The crust was too floury on the edges and it was soggy in the middle.   I also ordered the Italian chop salad and it was not great either. It was just \"meh.\" I feel as though a $10 salad should be more flavorful and have more interesting elements.   The espresso gelato was good. It was the only thing I really liked there and would have again, but it's not worth the trip back just for that."}
{"text":"Love the wood burning pizza oven. The service is fast and attentive. The salads,the pizza,the apps are all excellent. Very affordable with specials all wee long including a reverse happy hour. Great wine selection. I really enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved it! My app was the eggplant, hubbie's was the risotto balls. Pizza was fantastic and was interesting to watch them prep and cook it. They were out of the special K dessert so we tried the toffee pudding. Delish. And happy hour all day on Sunday. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am hooked on their fabulous Phoenix salad with a spring mix, orange segments, goat cheese, candied walnuts, cranberry vinaigrette- a perfect combination. My favorite pizza is the Triple P Pizza with fresh basil, fresh mozzarella, pancetta, goat cheese, fig jam, roasted mushrooms, arugula, red onion. It may sound funky but it is delicious.  Those are our 2 go-to favorites. So much so they know what I want when I go in. Thier pizza crust has the just right chew. Heaven.  I have been Pizza Bianco in Phoenix a couple times on my pizza journey quest. But Bella Gusto's pizza is even better.  I'm hoping for a pizza lunch special on their menu someday."}
{"text":"Great pizza when it is consistent. Depending on who makes the pizza, there might be large sections without any toppings (and they are small pizzas). I would give them 5 stars if our last few pizzas hadn't been part sauce and bread on too large of a proportion."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them 3.5 stars.   Decor is kinda slopped together but it seemed clean.   Food was nice and fresh but not outstanding. We tried 6 different menu items. Nothing I'm excited to go back for.   Service was attentive but almost too much. Kinda wanted to be left alone a bit more.   With tip, water to drink, and one dessert to share, it was about $30 per person. A meal that costs that much should be a nicer place."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! I got the one with the habenero honey--outstanding! My husband got the meatball panini and enjoyed it. My son got the veggie pizza and really liked it. We also got the house salad and it was quite good. I really liked the pickled onion. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A friend highly recommended their pizza, so we thought we'd give it a try. We ordered veggie supreme pizza, light on mozzarella, and added pepperoni. Was offered a leaner/premium pepperoni, so we specified that, for pick up. They said it would take 15-30 minutes. When I got there 25 minutes later, the pizza was sitting on a counter, and the box was cold. I asked why isn't the box under warm lamps, or in an insulated holder, or something. She said they don't do anything to keep the pizza warm. (Isn't there food safety standards?) Needless to say, when I got home and opened the box, the pizza was cold. I made the mistake of trying to transfer the cold pizza to a pizza pan since the crust was soggy, but it was a mess with toppings sliding off and the crust curling under. Even putting in a preheated oven for 20 minutes, it just did not warm well, nor did the crust firm up.  Had my first soggy pizza which I did not care for. My husband and a friend thought it tasted good. I think we'll stick with Miele's Italian Restaurant's pizza in Mesa, their's is the best and has a wonderful dining atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Very nice. First time and had a great time. Loved the Sangria with the shot of vodka.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service first off... Really explained the menu and gave great suggestions!  The lunch special was great - meatball sandwich was really good with a side Italian salad."}
{"text":"Pizza I order had a good taste & crust was good. But there was supposed to be some meat on it & there was only like 4 tiny strips. It was very pricey for my taste. $15 with a few crumbs on it. Gourmet or not, you need stuff on the pizza! The crust was also very wide in some spots too."}
{"text":"We LOVE Bella Gusto!  We work in the neighborhood and go there for lunch once a week.  We don't say a lot once the food arrives except, \"this is SO good\"!  We get the lunch special.  You will not beat the price at $8!  The bread is to die for!  My favorite is the half Phoenix salad and half Italian Stallion.  The Phoenix salad is made of a gorgeous spring mix, oranges, goat cheese, walnuts, and vinaigrette.  The Italian Stallion is made of spicy soppressata, ham, prosciutto, giardiniera, arugula, tomato jam and fontina Cheese.  The giardiniera is amazing.  Very unique flavors and so delicious on this sandwich.  I cannot say enough.  We get so sick of the same old lunch places.  Breathe of fresh air!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Rivals Atlanta's pizza antico. Great pizza, great wine and the staff couldn't be better"}
{"text":"The food here is very fresh and very delicious. It's one of my new favorite places to eat. Maybe to some it might be a little pricey, but it's honestly worth every penny. Don't forget to try the dessert too...yummy."}
{"text":"I expected better. I threw it all away after one slice.  First of all, the mozzarella is that kind you see at Blaze that they pull out of the water and tear pieces off. Not a fan. Second of all the pepperoni is more similar to prosciutto. This place is an acquired taste.   Third, the bread was both soggy and crunchy. And lastly the Sauce was watery. Defiantly the worst pizza I've ever eaten, and I usually like all types of pizza."}
{"text":"We are thrilled to have a new neighborhood place. First time last night. Best calamari I've ever had. Husband had the Italian Stallion panini - loved it - and those Parmesan Frites are definitely habit forming. I went for the Gusto Bolognese and it was delicious. Plenty of take home for a second meal of both. Family friendly, staff and owners are wonderful. Red Sangria was delicious and light. We are planning on making this a weekly go-to. Have to say it was fun watching a couple cute little boys watching the pizza making process!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the area!  We came in on a Tuesday evening around 6pm, just in time for the pizza + bottle of wine for $22 deal. What an incredible deal! We ordered the pepperoni & mushroom pizza and bottle of Barolo wine. The pizza was so delicious -- authentic, Italian pizza with fresh ingredients and deliciously doughy bread cooked in their wood-fired oven.  The service was extremely friendly. Our waitress was wonderful and attentive, and the owner, Matt, even came over to say hello and see how everything was.  We will absolutely be back in. Wish it was closer to us, but definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great pizza in wood fired oven.  We also had the chopped  salad and the eggplant sandwich.  Everything was good. Will definitely be back to try the homemade pasta, desserts and more items.  My new favorite pizza in Chandler!"}
{"text":"This place is one of kind! Food is phenomenal, service top notch, and an atmosphere where you just want to stay a little while longer. My fiancé and I enjoyed a pizza, a sandwich, and local beers at a very reasonable price! The bartender had us rolling and the owners took the time to explain the details of what makes their restaurant different from the rest. The concept is based on everything fresh made in house and the taste proves this! Another reason to shop, eat and love local!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good. Wood fired oven. However I felt that it was overpriced for what you received."}
{"text":"Had the Italian chopped salad which was excellent.  Entree was meatball panini which was fair at best.  Meatballs were below average and panini slightly burned.  My wife had the spaghetti and meatballs which she states was not very good.    Service was good.  Place was very casual.  Not sure I would return with so many other better choices in the area."}
{"text":"Seriously, right up there with Pizzeria Bianco. The selection of pizzas is very good--something for everyone. Mozarella is fresh, dough was good, and cooked perfectly. The tomato sauce is wonderful. Try the \"Pepperoni\" which is actually hot soppressata. Service was wonderful, atmosphere is relaxed and very family friendly. Beers on tap are very good. Enjoy a hideaway pizza place in Chandler (you know the hideaways are typically the best anyway!)."}
{"text":"Go here! You can taste the quality ingredients and freshness! Great ambiance  and servers. Appetizers and meals were delicious and prices are great. My 4 year old daughter loved it as much as I did!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Chandler hands down!  Must try it's amazing all house made meats, cheese and dough! BTry it you will NOT be disappointed!!!  It's the best pizza I've ever eaten, super fresh!"}
{"text":"This is a gem that has not yet been discovered. I always get the pepperoni pizza. The pepperonis are huge and they have a perfect flavor. When I go wth the wife we always have to end the meal with their Ulalula Desert Pie. I would describe it as a PB&J pizza except 1000 time better!! Please know that you will never be disappointed with anything on their menu!! Give it a Try!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't get any better, the food is fantastic and the owners and staff are not only friendly but go above and beyond!! I cannot recommend this place enough. From pizza to salad the rest of the menu is well put together and even the pasta wins acclaims from my girlfriend. However I usually find myself enjoying the \"Tuesday night special\", which is basically a pizza and wine for an unbelievable price. Trust me on this place, it's sure to satisfy!!!"}
{"text":"Really good. I craved good pizza during my pregnancy and this place was perfect. We went a few times and I had my husband pick up a time or two also. Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizza... great flavor. I ordered the meaty. It could have been a little more meaty. The extra pizza sauce added some additional flavor. Would recommends making a stop here!"}
{"text":"The pizza is PHENOMENAL! Some of the best I've ever had- which helps make up for the lack of ambiance. Our server was very attentive and friendly- which helps make up for the somewhat pricey drinks. Speaking of which, they offer a selection of beer and wine...and Tito's vodka. That's it. Why only vodka? That meant only one of the two of us were getting the drink that we wanted- until we were told they also do not stock tonic. What?! That's crazy. Seriously superb pizza, though."}
{"text":"Yum yum and more yum!  Enjoyed a date Night out with the hubby. We ordered: The burrata appetizer- if you love burrata you will love this yummy combo! The Sicilian and the White pizza with arugula- both fabulous and we had left overs!  Then we could not pass up the sticky cake- wowza!!!!  Everything was perfectly prepared and our server was also great and made great recommendations!  We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian place in the Phoenix metropolitan area! The burrata is AMAZING and the sticky toffee cake is a must have. Service is always incredible - we've had Dorie most of our visits and always ask to sit in her section! I would highly recommend venturing in to this hole in the wall. You can't go wrong with a pizza and the panini's are a great value for the price!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was where this place really shines in my book. I went there to catch up with a close friend. She ended up being about 10-15 minutes behind me so I sat there without ordering anything during that time and normally would have felt a little awkward doing so. The server/hostess made small talk with me and never made me feel rushed. Once my friend got there we talked for awhile before ordering drinks and bread. Once we got that it was another length of time before ordering our dinner. Once again, the server made us feel only welcome and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Other servers/employees smiled at us when they walked by and checked on us if they were free and near our table. I give the service the full five stars.   The food was good, not great. We ordered the bread to start, which was a little chewy (like pizza dough), lacking in flavor, and not something I would order again. It would have been okay if you were putting something like the burrata on it. We split the eggplant parm sandwhich and the margarita pizza. The sandwich was tough to eat and the eggplant was pretty heavily fried and okay, but the tomato sauce was delicious. The pizza was wonderful and I would definitely order that again. Overall I would recommend and gladly return."}
{"text":"I'm over the moon that I found this neighborhood spot, thanks to my fellow Yelpers!! Great food and great service! I always get the meaty pizza and add extra cheese, extra sausage and garlic truffle oil! Yum!! Wednesday night is $10 pizza and Thursday is 1/2 off bottles of wine!! Ya just can't go wrong here! Oh yeah, Darlene-or D-Lo SS I call her, is awesome! She always remembers my order when I don't! #ThatsService"}
{"text":"Amazing lil itiallian place great pizza great pasta all scratch made you must try the sticky cake fresh homemade breads all the pizza are delicious"}
{"text":"Overall, this place was meh. The meatball sandwich was fantastic.  Everything else was pretty bland. Struggled to get the kids to eat their leftovers of pepperoni pizza and chicken parm. Had to add Ranch to both.   Waitress seemed to have more interesting things to do in the back than wait tables. There was only 1 other table there, so I know she wasn't busy.    I'd order the sandwich to go, otherwise I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Meh. The service was atrocious but the food was good. A bit overpriced, but not enough to make me not come back. I would give it another shot. Hopefully better service next time."}
{"text":"I live very close to Bella Gusto and go there all the time for either take out or dine in. I have always found their food to be delicious and service to be excellent. When I have family in town, we order take out and their wood fired pizzas are delicious and my parents love getting their fresh mozz and bread. I am a fairly critical person and I have not had one bad experience with this place and even if I did at this point, it would be forgiven as I go there about once a week. I hope this place keeps doing what they are doing because it is consistent, prices are not bad and the food is good. What more can you want?"}
{"text":"Another great dinner at Bella. If you haven't given this place a try, make it a priority! Rosemary house bread is so good. We had the Italian chopped salad and pepperoni pizza- pretty perfect for an easy Sunday dinner!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite lunch spot with my husband! We've visited twice already and the two times the pizzas were DELICIOUS  They actually have a great deal right now on Wednesdays, all of their pizzas are $10!  Their pizzas are very tasty, the crust is great. Usually my husband gives me his crust but not at Bella Gusto, he eats it all!!"}
{"text":"Great, GREAT pizza. Super thin crust, cooked to perfection in the wood-fired oven. Learned that they use pecan wood which give the dough an amazingly sweet (but not overpowering!) flavor! And some mesquite for a little bit of smoke. DELICIOUS. Superb house made sausage, thinly sliced Italian meats, and just enough cheese!!! Got some cannolis to go and am looking forward to enjoying them later!!"}
{"text":"I'm always scanning through Yelp for new pizza places - specifically of the wood-fired variant. While Central Phoenix will give you plenty of great options, Chandler has never seemed to really be one to jump on the bandwagon. And no, those fast-casual chains don't count, regardless of how long their lines are. Sorry!  Bella Gusto unexpectedly popped up in my searches, which was a surprise, considering I've never heard of it. As of this writing (July 2016), the restaurant has only been open for about 15 weeks according to our server. I expect its popularity to pick up pretty quickly once word spreads.  To start out, we received some house-made focaccia bread with olive oil. It was actually extremely good! Very moist and flavorful, with a serving that was large enough that we still had plenty to take home. We also ordered the burrata, which included some apricot jam and kale. We'd both classify the burrata as good, but not quite great. There are very few restaurants that somehow take their burrata over the top, so I don't really discredit them for this. We both enjoyed it and my girlfriend really liked the apricot jam addition.  As for pizzas, we ordered a standard margherita with spicy sopresatta added to one side. For the second, we opted for the Triple P, which consisted of pancetta, goat cheese, pickled onions, and roasted mushrooms. I've got the pancetta and pickled onions. I'm not sure what the other P stands for? We originally wanted to do half-half pies so we could try more variety, but when the server checked with the owner, he said no. I've always found it funny that Pizzeria Bianco, what many consider to be best in the country, has absolutely no issue doing this, but these small-time joints are always insistent that we'll ruin the pizza. Eh, my girlfriend and I have about four years worth of pictures and taste testing that proves otherwise, but we'll play nice this time.  The red pizza was just okay. We both felt that the sauce wasn't the best quality, as it had that canned tomato paste flavor to it that we've never really been a fan of. The bottom layer was also on the crunchy side, which I'm pretty sure was unintentional. The Triple P, however, was much better, offering up a nice, floppy middle that we're lovingly familiar with, as well as a pretty decent crust that had above average flavor with just the right amount of char. Are they on the same level as what you could get at some of the \"big guns\" in Central Phoenix? Not quite, but the pizza is still leagues better than competing options in Chandler.  For dessert, we ordered their affagato. We've grown quite fond of this dessert in recent time. Most places serve it with gelato/espresso, with absolutely no modification other than the addition of some biscotti (if you're lucky). This place, however, dares to be different, while actually incorporating a brownie into the mix. The combination of a chocolate/coffee brownie, espresso, and coffee-flavored gelato works extremely well and was something I'd highly recommend trying. Just be sure it's done properly.  On a second visit, the brownie was all crumbly and soggy, which I assume is the result of under-baking.    As for the location and decor, I can't help but laugh at some of the comments. For Christ's sake, this is a local business, not an extremely polished corporate chain! Unless they're working with the Italian mafia on the side, no local business is just going to have the cash to open up smack-dab in the middle of Chandler Fashion with all of the other overly-polished chains. The food is what's important. Geography and interior design are of minimal importance this early in the game.  I can't give it a full five stars because I feel their food still needs some consistency. However, the food we had was very good overall. The server was very friendly and I predict it'll do well in satisfying an area that desperately needs some authentic Neapolitan pizza. Although they're nowhere close to where we live, we'll definitely make occasional visits when in the area.   Recommended!"}
{"text":"This is an absolutely great addition to the East Valley.  Nice selection of craft beers, strong happy hour, fresh made pastas, and crispy, chewy, charred Neapolitan crust pizza, exactly the way I like it.  I ordered a frosty Oskar Blues IPA draft which was $2.50/pint at happy hour on a Friday.  That alone is tough to beat, and is a good enough reason to go here.  We ordered the fried eggplant appetizer, and were very impressed.  Light, crispy eggplant strips over Boursin cheese and bacon, drizzled with truffle oil - delicious.  We also ordered a side of their signature meatballs, which was not on the menu, but a great idea.  They were served in the house red sauce and were light and juicy.  There were probably 6-7 meatballs in that order.  We were torn between pizza and pasta, so we got one of each.  The gnocchi in veal Bolognese sauce is a must order.  I can honestly say that they were the best gnocchi I've ever had, anywhere, by far.  They were light and fluffy, obviously made fresh, and served in a fantastic veal ragu over ricotta cheese.  Truly unique, and worth the trip just for those.  Our pizza was the Brunch Blast - a unique combination of sausage, mushrooms, potato, kale and Serrano peppers, finished with truffle oil.  It was a little spicy and very tasty.  Everything that we ordered was amazing, and we can't wait to go back to try a different pizza and a different pasta (although it will be very difficult to not order that gnocchi again).  We were too full for dessert, but they sounded incredible.  The dessert pies are apparently made right in the pizza oven, which is a new concept to me.  Our server was exceptional - very knowledgable, helpful and attentive.  The owner came over and introduced himself, which is always a nice touch.  It's been about 4 hours since we left, and I already want to go back.  It's so nice to have this place right here in Chandler."}
{"text":"This highly rated Italian restaurant really caught our eye when we were in the Chandler area on a Tuesday night. We were surrounded by one family and another couple. The restaurant isn't really visible from the street so I think that could be why it wasn't busy at dinner, because it certainly wasn't the food - which was delicious.   I started off with the Roma Caesar salad and my partner had the Italian Chop salad which was out of this world. We also took advantage of the current check in offer for their bread which was basically a pizza crust type of bread with oil and rosemary. They definitely know how to perfectly pair their ingredients up to complement each other.   I think we did make a mistake ordering the Four Cheese pizza as it was fairly overwhelming and heavy. We had to cut it by adding an extra side of pizza sauce for dipping.   Staff is really attentive and always looking to help out even if they aren't your waiter. Atmosphere is casual but still nice. Would definitely visit here again and try their other pizzas and pastas."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  The service  was great and professional.  Meatballs were very good and the sauce was  excellent. Pizza was a very good size and enough for two people to share.  Crust was perfectly done."}
{"text":"We really loved the food! I had the Sicilian pizza. It was really good. They have premium toppings and use San Marzano tomatoes for the sauce. The service was excellent! My only complaint is the decor. They could really use the services of an interior decorator. My husband feels that the decor was a an afterthought."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and very friendly service. I love this place!! They even had a live band on a Saturday I came. Highly recommend this pizza place!"}
{"text":"Great Pizzeria! Wood fired oven right when you come in. The pizzas were great, fresh, and hot. Great pastas, salads, and other sides, too."}
{"text":"Best pizza and prices in town. Wednesday's are $10 pizzas!!! Maybe I just go coincidentally at their off hours, but they're usually pretty empty looking inside (except when I had to wait almost an hour for a table in Valentine's Day!). Eat there anyways!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and will be back again! Had the Sicilian pizza and it was amazing. The customer service was great as well--the pizza my mom ordered was a little burnt on the bottom so they made and gave her a brand new one! The sangria was great as well. I'll save room next time for some sweet treats!"}
{"text":"YUM! My husband and I have been here 3 times now and the pizza and bruschetta have always been delicious.  Our favorite pizza is G.O.A.T, but we also enjoy the Mary Margarita, and Pepperoni.  The bruschetta is a must each time.  If you're looking for a salad, my favorite is the Phoenix."}
{"text":"This pizza is fantastic.  Probably due to the authentic wood burning oven from Italy and all the genuine Italian ingredients.  The pizza cooks in 90 seconds so it is not a long wait to that delicious food.  Good wine selection and nice atmosphere.  If you are looking for true Neopolitan pizza, this is it.  Our favorite is the Tuscan Village with is made with perfectly spiced italian sausage."}
{"text":"Amazing little restaurant we just happened upon in our neighborhood.  Amazing food, THE FRIES ARE TO DIE FOR!  Every dish I have had I have LOVED.  Great little find!"}
{"text":"My wife and I've eaten at Cibo, Pomo, Pizzicletta, Pizzaria Bianco. Although Bella Gusto's location isn't the best, their pizza is top notch and on par with all of these places. I would highly recommend checking these place out if you live close."}
{"text":"Really good! Nice homey feel Everything tastes very fresh and home made  I had small Italian chop Fried eggplant  Husband has gnocchi bolognese small Like that you can select a smaller portion for most items   They do have a kids menu  Next time (there will be a next time) we will try the pizza ! PS - live music on Saturday- two men, didn't catch their name  - were very good!"}
{"text":"The Santa Merda pizza is so far my favorite meal. If you like spicy and sweet I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Tried Bella Gusto tonight for the first time. The food was excellent, as was the nifty Neapolitan brick pizza oven. We had succulent calamari as an appetizer which was done perfectly, but should have come out with a small side of marinara. So, we had to stop our waitress to bring us some of this zesty red sauce. (There was a small amount under the calamari, and it gave it a beautiful look, but not enough sauce for three people to share.) Our waitress was fast and efficient, but there was no sweetener, sugar, salt, or pepper on any of the tables, so she was forced to keep running around for various items. My daughter had the Sicilian meaty pizza while I had the Prosciutto Arugula* pizza. Both were delicious and there was no skimping on the shaved Parmesan or arugula. Hubby had pasta and meatballs and some of our pizzas. He was unimpressed with his pasta, but this is a PIZZA restaurant, after all. Dessert was wonderful--daughter and I split the Affagoto, a perfect blend of  Espresso shot, chocolate / coffee brownie with coffee gelato. Multo Benne!!!  I would like to give this great addition to the East Valley food scene a 5/5, if not for the missing condiments on the table, overly loud music--not even Italian-- and the 2 huge big screen sports TVs, and the unruly, loud table with the 2 boys (not toddlers)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! So glad we found it.  Local sourced ingredients, so fresh. Best wood fired pizza I've had in the Valley.  They make everything fresh here in the restaurant, including the incredible mozzarella.  Gotta add this to your \"must go to\" list."}
{"text":"Delicious bread! Pasta is good but just not five stars at an amazing pizza joint like this. Don't kid yourself and get a pie! Not for thin crust, taste intolerant wimps though so be warned."}
{"text":"Bella gusto, or beautiful taste in Italian, lives true to its name! The pizza is wood fired and hand made to order. We came here for a late lunch and shared some calamari and the veggie supreme pizza.  The calamari was quite good, a delightful and tender portion of seafood with lightly crisp batter. It was a generous amount and just right for two. The veggie pizza was filled to the brim with vegetables and rich creamy house-made mozzarella but the thing I loved the most about the pizza was the perfect balance of crisp, light crust with a soft chewiness when you bit into it. The only slight negative I had was that it was slightly oversauced which made it hard to taste the other ingredients in the pizza. Note that each pizza you order is the same size, 14\", so you can plan your meal accordingly.  We ended our meal with gelato and what was touted as affogato but when I got my dessert it was basically a brownie a la mode with espresso poured on top. Now, technically affogato means \"drowned\" in Italian, so sure, this dessert was indeed \"drowned\" in espresso, but usually an affogato is a shot or two of espresso in a cup with gelato mixed into it. This was more like an \"upside down affogato\" I suppose :). The dessert was a large portion but the brownie was a bit too sweet for me and it was a little hard to incorporate the espresso into it since it was straight liquid espresso and not a sauce you can easily scoop with the ice cream and brownie.   Service was good and we were checked on as needed.  I'll definitely be back for more pizza if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was a big unsure about the decision to make a pizza place like this in this area and after attending I this I feel even more the same. Neapolitan pizza might be one of my favorite types of pizza and there's was pretty good, but pretty unmemorable. The house bread was decent, but nothing special. The place was pretty dead for a Friday. I figure it might be due to the location, but I guess I don't know for sure. The restaurant has a nice setup and everything. They have the oven out for everyone to watch if interested. Our server was friendly but a little crazy. She literally tried to up-sell on everything we tried to order. She almost forced us to go with one of her suggestions also which was pretty annoying after the 5th time. The price was pretty normal for those type of pizza places. The food was good, but the overall experience was not enough to make me want to go back when I can go to Pomo down the street for a much better overall experience."}
{"text":"That bruschetta was amazing and the Tuscan pizza was amazing. You can tell everything is made from scratch. So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Grubhub, God bless you for bringing Bella Gusto into my life.  I always like to try new places, so one night I ordered some items from Bella. From the get-go, I was hooked. Their pizzas come in one size, and it's perfect for splitting between two people. All of the meats that they use seem to be very high quality, and their meatballs are just a thing of magnificence. The Neapolitan pizza and the Meaty are our favorites, though the Margherita is also wonderful (because it's exactly what it should be- high quality cheese, tomato, and basil). Their calamari and fried eggplant are spectacular as well, and are definitely a step up from what you're used to. But the kicker that I discovered today was in their Pomodora pasta- thick slices of fresh garlic! None of that mealy, pre-chopped crapola!!!  This is one of those rare places that I've ordered from on Grubhub that I actually want to visit in person."}
{"text":"The pizza was outstanding ! The Burrata was on point, solid on the outside, creamy in the middle and the apricot with the balsamic glaze served along side of it was delicious ! It made me very happy"}
{"text":"Wood fired pizza, Calamari, meat and cheese platter, calamari this place kind has it all! The wine selection was awesome!"}
{"text":"Meh.Just a regular Pizza place."}
{"text":"This is a definite \"eat it here\" style of pizza. Fired in the oven for just a few minutes, the pies come to the table perfectly cooked and ready to devour! We chose the Fungi Pizza from the red side and the four cheese pizza from the white side. Both were exceptional...true Italian style."}
{"text":"I was alerted on my Open Table account \"new restaurant openings\", and Bella Gusto (Chandler AZ) basically got excellent reviews on yelp. I made a reservation through Open Table thinking it would be packed for lunch especially in that area at 12:15. We arrive, very spacious place, beautiful brick oven, we were the 3rd table seated. To our surprise the place was empty.  Our server was very good and very attentive especially refilling ice teas and water. Off the bat, what restaurant does not have artificial sweetener upon request to put in the ice tea? That in itself annoyed me to know end. We ordered the Veggie Supreme (roasted mushrooms, olives, artichokes, bell peppers, red onion) and Pepperoni (fresh mozzarella, spicy soppressata, pecorino romano). Both Pizzas were very good, baked perfectly, fresh ingredients. Was it outstanding with all the Brick Oven competition out there? No but service and pizza were good, we happened to be in the neighborhood. We would not make a special trip, but if you live in that area you have to try it. I just hope it gets busier."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian place!!! The gnocchi is my favorite or the Sicilian pizza.  The staff is friendly and they have a live band sometimes which is cool. I would eat here every night if I could."}
{"text":"Very delicious food from calamari to pizza! The gnocchi was homemade and so tasty! Friendly service and great atmosphere for small and large groups! And for the guys in the group, there are flat screens!"}
{"text":"Wow..... This place is a new local favorite!!! Amazing service from Jenny (bartender).  Had the homemade burrata to start which was rich, creamy and slightly herbaceous. Moved on to two pies the meaty and the veggie supreme... Best pizza we've had in the valley, the crust is crunchy and thin. Pizza extremely reminiscent of Italy perfect bite every time. Tuesday Wine and pizza deal cannot be missed!!! Keep this place busy we need local joints to be successful in Chandler... Several managers stopped by to see how the food was and make sure we were happy, you don't get this level of service often.   Love this place"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service.  Decent pizza but unlike what one reviewer said, it is not comparable to Pizzeria Bianco."}
{"text":"Great food, service, atmosphere and overall experience. We highly recommend this Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"First impressions set the mood for this reivew. The restaurant is small and has no wow factor. The wine was really overpriced. Service was adequate but nothing to write home about.  The eggplant panini tasted like bread soaked in fry oil with a hint of artichoke and just barely perceptible eggplant. When a business gives up on the side salad you know their goal is not quality. The side ceasr consisted solely of romaine lettuce,croutons, large shavings of parmesan (not well-balanced), and a runny dressing.   The pizza is the only reason this restaurant got more than 1 star. The crust is actually pretty tasty. The toppings...meh, subpar. The sauce could have easily come from a can. Overall, completely underwhelmed and disappointed in my dinner."}
{"text":"Found on yelp and agree with the reviews and high rating. Excellent food. Very fast and friendly service. Checked and refilled our drinks. We ordered the pepperoni pizza and the gnocchi bolognese. Pasta is clearly fresh, homemade as are the sauces. We are only here two nights and might go back tomorrow night or again at lunch."}
{"text":"Burrata is amazing. The meaty and the viva Roma are unbelievable. John and Matt the owners are very knowledgeable and flavors are out of this world!! If you want pizza that you can't find online or something that will treat your pallete...got to Bella Gusto. 10 stars way up"}
{"text":"This pizza ROCKS. The only way I can describe it is smoooooth. We ordered the Funghi and the sauce was amazing, bread was great... the truffle oil sets everything off in the best way... gonna be a regular visit for sure."}
{"text":"This place makes me sad. We went here about 6 months or more ago to try it out since we read good reviews. I didn't remember much about it but we never went back. So recently we were looking on yelp for a place to go for wood fired pizza and I remembered Bella Gusto had tasty pizza but I couldn't remember why we never went back. When we walked through the door last week it all came back to me. The atmosphere is terrible. It starts when you pull into the strip mall which is in dirty, horrible condition, however I wouldn't hold that against the place if it didn't have other strikes against it. The place is just unappealing. They have this gorgeous tiled brick oven which I'm assuming came from Italy and cost a fortune. Then it's all downhill from there. It's dark, and not in a hip moody kind of way, the tables and chairs are low quality and in poor shape. They were blasting what could be categorized as bad 70's rock music which is completely ill fitting to the place. The multiple TV screens playing sports and crappy commercials, it's a downer. I'm eating a $16 pizza and watching ads for Subway. If I had to sum it up I'd say this place can't decide what it wants to be. Do they want to be a chic brick oven pizzeria? Or do they want to be a dive sports bar? You can't be both. I get that owning a restaurant is hard and bars make money, but the food and the atmosphere don't jive at Bella Gusto. Even the way the tables are set up is awkward, the place needs to be revamped. Here's the rub. The pizza is good, it's VERY good. And I am a pizza snob, I don't even hide it.  I usually try to seek out real wood fired brick oven Napoletana style pizza in any town I visit. We frequent the VPN pizza restaurants in town often (to my knowledge there are only 4 in Arizona, Fat Olives, La Piazza x2 and Pomo x 4 and Vero Amore), the ones that have their recipes and ingredients certified from an Italian organization, certified to be damn tasty and to be made correctly with the proper ingredients. Well sadly Bella Gusto is really, really close to being as good as a VPN pizzeria. That says a LOT about their food. Their sauce and crust are phenomenal. However, I can't justify paying those prices, even though it's very reasonable, and sit in a dive sports bar atmosphere. When I go out for that type of pizza I'm looking for more of a date night atmosphere, I'm thinking pizza wine and unnoticeable background music not pizza, beer and sports. Now I might be biased because I'm Italian but I feel like if you're going to be a pizzeria that serves mostly pizza and mostly the more expensive Italian brick oven style pizza, then you should probably be playing Italian music or at least something more palatable for dinner than Lyndard Skynard or CCR at high volume. Like I said, they make great pizza, but they don't know what they want to be. I hope they figure it out some day because I'd definitely give them another try if the atmosphere changed."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem in chandler - very good pizza and moderately priced - pizza done in super hot wood oven so don't rush ordering as it comes fast and hot - we Wil be back"}
{"text":"Great food and a wonderful addition to chandler. Eaten here twice and both time has been wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"Since our first visit, we've been back twice and the food and service have been absolutely fantastic! This place is truly remarkable and I'm so glad that it opened in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! We really enjoyed the food and the service. The House bubble bread was delicious, I think the would be even better if the had some balsamic glaze for it. Our main meal was great. The server talked us into the sticky toffee pudding and it was divine. We want to go back just to get dessert!"}
{"text":"The most yummy Italian restaurant in Chandler, AZ. A must try......everything is so good. The pizza, the pastas and bruschetta is to die for."}
{"text":"Ordered the margherita, flavortown and the proscuitto arugula. My personal favorite was the margherita--the crust was so thin and chewy. It was very delicious. The rest of the family really enjoyed the proscuitto arugula though. We hope to come back."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp, it definitely stuck out because of the rave reviews.  My friend and I went, and we were both blown away by what turned out to be one of the best dining experiences we've ever had!  As an appetizer, we ordered the house made burrata.  It came with wilted kale, a fresh apricot compote, and toasted rustic bread.  What an incredible combination of flavors, they all complimented each other beautifully.  The burrata was fresh and creamy, hands down, the best burrata I've ever had.  It was so delicious, that we completely forgot that we also ordered a pizza.  We chose the \"Flavortown\", which was drizzled with delicious truffle oil, that I could immediately smell, as it was being brought to our table.  As soon as we took a bite, we completely forgot about the appetizer we just had.  The pizza was amazing, I've never had anything like it...ever!  It was cooked Neapolitan Style,  which goes into a 1,000 degree oven, and brought to your table within 90 seconds.  I highly recommend this place, which I have now bookmarked.  I haven't stopped talking about it , since we went on Saturday.  I can't wait to come here with friends and family.  Lastly, our server Kassandra was very sweet, and very attentive and engaging.  When the Chef and Owner John found out how much we enjoyed ourselves, he came over to introduce himself, and thanked us for coming in.  It wasn't too busy when we got there, probably because it's hidden in the far end of the shopping center where it's located.  Don't let that stop you, it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"You must check out this place!!! The pizza was and the service  (Alexandria) was delightful!!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place out, I drove by the other day.. didn't even know it was there.  So..looked it up, checked the reviews & everything looked promising. Unfortunately..it was very disappointing & over priced... We ordered 1 pepperoni & 1 veggie..the pepperoni had very little pepperoni..& the pizzas are 14\" sooooo don't know what happened there.. & the crust was more burned then it needed to be. I've had some of the best pizzas in the world... Italy, New York City..so I know what's good. The pizza was a big disappointment. I ordered the chopped salad which looked great but tasteless...( They charge you $2.00 if you get a salad to share?? WT??) Of course..I ordered the full salad & shared with my husband w/o telling them.  We might try again...@ a much later time.. 4 adults...$75.00 later & was still hungry when I left."}
{"text":"The pizza and salad are delicious! Just what a Neopolitan pizza should taste like. My husband and I have been twice and good each time. I don't think I would meet with a group here because when you meet friends you want to stay longer. The chairs are uncomfortable to sit for a longer period of time. The atmosphere is not very inviting and warm. It is also uncomfortably cold in here. The pictures on the wall don't quite fit the space. It also smells like cleaning agents when you first walk in. I was hoping this wouldn't be the case my second visit. It's unfortunate because the pizza is delicious!! We may do take out next time."}
{"text":"First time here and so nice to find a place close to us with great pie and great folks. We'll be back for pasta and live music. Thank you, Jenny, for great service too !!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and had to check it out.. This place is tucked away all the way in the corner in the big lots plaza.. When we first got here this place was empty but we came here after the lunch rush.. The staff are friendly here and most of everything they make here is freshly made everyday which I like.. Everything that we had here was delicious, no complaints.. You get free house bread when you check in on Yelp.."}
{"text":"This is a very unassuming restaurant in a place you wouldn't expect to find it. Hidden off in the corner of a big shopping complex this place truly is a gem.   The inside of the restaurant is nothing to write home about. Very simple. This is definitely a place that lets the food and service speak for itself.   Myself and a date came in here on a Friday night around 7 and it was only about half full (which made me feel very silly for making a reservation), so we were seated right away. The menu is very simple but has a variety of things to order.   Everything just felt so fresh, the food tasted absolutely delicious. We had an appetizer of the house bread which was fantastic. And we ordered a margarita pizza and a Tuscan pizza. The sauce was perfect, it's wood fired in there oven in house which is visible from the table so there's a bit of showmanship there which is nice.   There's nothing fancy about this. They've mastered the art of incredible food with fresh ingredients. Period. Do yourself a favor and grab a slice here."}
{"text":"WOW, this place is great! Very cute and cozy. The staff is super friendly. The food....AMAZING! We ordered the fried eggplant for an app and it was damn good!!! And then on our servers recommendation we ordered the Sicilian pizza and hot damn that was reallllly good! The ricotta cheese makes that pizza amazing! Very reasonable prices, totally worth every penny!!! New fav pizza joint"}
{"text":"Great pizza cooked in a wood oven.  The pizza chef has amazing skills keeping the oven just right.  Too many pizza places use a toaster oven on a track belt.  This wood burning oven cooks quickly and adds an amazing taste with a crisp thin crust.    They do have a kids menu.  My kids had the margarita and Sicilian pizza. Not too spicy, the kids loved it.    Wed is $10 pizza night.  Amazing deal.  This pizza is comparable to Pizzeria Bianco.  Alice the waitress was awesome.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night to check out the $22 Pizza & Wine Special. I assumed it was going to be a generic personal size cheese pizza and a house wine but boy was I wrong! First of all they let you choose from any of their pizza's, and a whole list of wines. My friend and I shared the Burrata appetizer, which was super tasty. Its home made burrata topped with wilted kale, balsamic reduction and this apricot mustarda stuff which is a perfect pairing. Also no clue what the kale was seasoned with but really flavorful! We got the Sicilian pizza and it was perfect. My favorite thing about the pizza was that instead of using your typical pepperoni which leaves way too much oil and grease, they import some sort of spicy soppressata instead! Meatballs were really tender and the Sharps Hill wine was fantastic. We finished the last drop and bite of everything! Copper & Jen were our bartenders, both were very knowledgeable and welcoming. Between the staff, atmosphere, food and drink ... I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Fresh pasta, sauce, mozzarella - truly a treat! And the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a local neighborhood date night spot. Bella Gusto surpassed all of our expectations. The food was so fresh and delicious. We ordered the house bread, bruschetta, fried eggplant and the Mary Margarita pizza. We finished with the sticky toffee pudding and I was actually sad when we finished the last bite, it was that good. Darleen was our server and she was knowledgeable about the menu and so sweet. We cannot wait to go back and I think that this place has become \"our spot.\" Thank you all for such a great experience."}
{"text":"This is such a great hidden gem. The service was phenomenal and the food was amazing. We let the server take charge and plan our meal for us so everything was a surprise. We got the house bread, meatballs, gusto bb salad and the triple P pizza. All of it was delicious and just kept getting better. We even had dessert, house made cheesecake! The server was well versed in the menu, wine and any questions we had. It was such a wonderful experience and cannot wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. Caesar salad with dried cranberries not good at all... Dressing was flavorless croutons crazy hard... Break your teeth hard.  The tripple p was good the prosciutto pizza was bland.... I know it's slow and you guys just opened but the staff was way off task more worried about joking around.  Kinda awkward when your the only table in the house. Asked for salad to come out with the pizzas and the salad came out 10 min before. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"This is a cute little joint with very handmade pizza and other fresh made appetizers and entrees.They have great a great  bottle of wine and pizza special on Tuesday for I think $22.00 which is a great deal. its a cozy environment. When I went again a couple weeks ago they had live music which i loved! I will def. be back."}
{"text":"Visited Bella Gusto for lunch today for the first time and had their Phoenix Salad and Meatball Panini.   Everything was delicious - bread was rustic homemade, mozzarella is homemade.   Would definitely go back and try their other items."}
{"text":"If you are going to open a legit Woodfired Pizza Joint in this city, you are going to be compared to the best there is in town. Bianco. In that comparison, this place fails miserably. The pizza was both overcooked and undercooked, limpy yet burnt. Gross. If you pick a slice up, everything slides right off, just a sloppy Pizza. I am puzzled as to why this place was so highly rated."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely Devine, we are coming back for sure! The food is prepared fresh daily. Service is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I had such great expectations. Most of our three pizzas were burnt. Even the one we sent back came back burnt. For the few bites that weren't burnt, the pizza was very tasty, though very light on the mozzarella. The Caesar salad was fresh but very little taste and very little Parmesan.   We were looking for a great new pizza place, but unfortunately this place isn't it. Not sure we'd be back. With some work, it could be awesome."}
{"text":"Had to update this one because the Tuscan pizza we had wasn't very good at all. The one that had some sort of Habanero jam was awesome.  The Mac n cheese appraiser is great as is the fried mozzarella except ours was cold inside.  The only downside is the price of the pizzas. They are small pizzas about the size of what you get at Fired Pie for $9. These ones are maybe a tad better and around $15-16 each. A bit steep for a small thin pizza."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype on this place. When I arrived, no one greeted me at the door, nor are there any clearly visible signs indicating where I was supposed to find someone. After waiting for an uncomfortable moment, the bartender greeted me from across the restaurant. I told her I was picking up, and she took me to bar to pay for my food. I don't like that. I don't want to stand above people drinking at the bar while I pay for my food. I paid, and they handed me a pizza that was clearly cold as soon as I grabbed it. I arrived at the exact time they said it would be ready, and it was a cold pizza. If I hadn't been in a rush and hungry, I might have asked them to remake it for me. Instead, I will not be visiting this location again, and I advise others to steer clear as well."}
{"text":"Ok, 5th time is a charm. Tried multiple items, pizzas and sandwiches etc.. ALWAYS consistent and very delicious.. #1 spot for this style pizza.., yes now i rank this above pizza bianco since the broader menu items..   Great job bella gusto.. cheers  best meatball sandwich i have ever had. fresh salad, awesome preperation.  thanks"}
{"text":"We enjoy this restaurant! Food is always delicious, and Tuesday night's wine and pizza special is awesome."}
{"text":"Living less than a mile away, we couldn't wait any longer to eat here. We made easy reservations via Yelp and they had our table ready right on time! We had 4 adults and 2 children dining on a Saturday evening. Our waitress was wonderful (terrible with names, but she had glasses and was absolutely adorable). Our drinks were always filled and she ALWAYS checked on the children's milk. I have never been to a restaurant where the wait staff goes out of their way to make sure the kids have drinks refilled.   We checked in and got the house bread for free! What a great deal! We snacked on it while making our decisions. I got the Triple P (omg most delicious pizza ever). My husband got the Fungi and the kids ordered the pepperoni pizza and the butter noodles. I was surprised at the large quantity of food for the children. They loved their meals and my husband scarfed down the Fungi.   We can't wait to come back. We were thoroughly impressed with the kindness of the staff, the deliciousness of the pizza, and the overall enjoyable location/atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We started with the bruschetta which was great and had a Margherita pizza and a GOAT pizza. They both were good but the GOAT pizza stood out. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went to Bella Gusto a second time and took friends with us.  It was even better than I remembered.  everything was delicious, the service was great and the happy hour prices on Sunday make it incredibly affordable.  Bella Gusto may be stuck with me every Sunday.  The triple p pizza and the slider appetizers are superb."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, bartender was super personable and the owner took the time to introduce himself and share a little about the history of the restaurant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in we were impressed. The Decour was fabulous and the view of the brick oven was also great. It's really close to work and we were still wearing our badges, so they asked us what we did for a profession and mentioned we were teachers. Luckily it was Thursday which is teacher appreciation day. Every Thursday teachers are appreciated by receiving a 15% off discount. With our Yelp checkin we got a free focaccia appetizer and it was so flavorful *dreams about it*  We each ordered a pizza but it can totally be shared. But regardless it was amazing. So sad we were too full for dessert. We took me yes back to work for others to check out at our school as well.   Dory was our server and she was so great from the second we walked in and respected our one hour lunch time restraint. Will definitely come out over the weekend :)"}
{"text":"Any self-respecting Neapolitan pizza connoisseur knows that it's all about the dough. The water, the flour, and of course the 90 seconds in the oven. With that said, I've been to Naples and have had the authentic street pizza and this stuff holds its own. I ordered the Mary Margherita because I feel the best way to rate a Neapolitan pizza is by getting the OG. A friend ordered Nobile Chicken Parmesan with Parmesan frites.   For the pizza the San Marzano sauce is super clean and I enjoyed the generous amount of EVOO drizzled on the pie. Not sure if they use buffalo mozzarella but it's got a good flavor. The basil was a bit burnt and I assume it was put on too soon after removed from the oven.   The chicken sandwich was okay; the meat was like a fried cutlet and that's not my favorite. The fries were amazing and I found myself eating far too many. Parsley, Parmesan, salt and whole lot of love when into them.   The dough (pizza and sandwich bread) however is the star of the meal. It has perfect amounts of char and crunch while retaining that chewy taste infused with stone flavors from the brick oven.   There is a bar with some high seating and about 20 tables. The ambiance is okay and the decor is pretty blaise. I didn't care for the hostess wearing Lulu Lemon yoga attire but other than that I enjoyed my visit here. I will update my review after the next visit when I get the papperdelle pomodoro. Ciao!"}
{"text":"OMG The most flavorful pizza, great salad and then the DESERTS  This place is now my favorite pizza place  Add some craft beers  Oh yes  You should try"}
{"text":"Food was great! And love the fact that it's close to home. Had the meat and cheese board (very nice variety). It was lots of food and bread wasn't too hard! Add a pepperoni pizza and a bottle of wine and you're set!"}
{"text":"Went here with some coworkers on my first day at my new job and had the eggplant sandwich. The eggplant wasn't over breaded and was perfectly cooked to my liking. My coworkers got other sandwiches and pizza and everyone left full and happy."}
{"text":"We dined here on 3/7/18.  The staff and owner were extremely friendly and on Wednesdays they have all of their pizzas for $10!  A great price.  My fiance' had the Flavortown pizza (blanco) and I had their Tuscan special.  Both were some of the best Neapolitan style pizza we have had in the Phoenix metro area.  John, one of the owners was very pleasant and shared that they make their own sauses and mozzarella cheese.  Their pizzas are also all made in their wood fired oven.  In addition to pizza, their menu includes pastas, sandwiches, salads, appetizers and desserts.  And finally, they play great music.  A terrific place and is now one of our \"go to\" places for pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Its wood fired and very thin. It is soggy toward the middle and more crispy toward the crust which normally I dont enjoy, however the ingredients were very fresh which made up for the sogginess.   What I actually enjoyed most was the ambience of the restaurant and thought it was great whether you decided to take a date or go out for pizza with a couple close friends. The colors used for paint are warm and the brick wall gives an inviting cozy feeling. Combined with the open pizza oven that you can see the fire, you have a spot that can make for a nice evening with someone special.   There is also a cute little bar and I did notice they have a happy hour, so that would be worth checking into. We had a few drinks and got a pizza and salad and our bill was a reasonable $40.00.   I would recommend this cute little place to family and friends!"}
{"text":"We live in the midwest but frequently visit the Phoenix area.  Bella Gusto is always on our list of restaurants to visit when in town.  On our most recent visit, we experienced the usual terrific service and enjoyed delicious wood fired pizzas and fresh salad.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing - their house bread was a beautiful pizza bread with olive oil and rosemary for $4 - the burrata was house made and amazing and the pizza was great - chewy crust, fresh ingredients - a great experience - great little wine list that was reasonable and it was ladies night so $5 drinks for the ladies.  Service was wonderful - it is apparently very well trained as the team all helped one another - definitely a do again!"}
{"text":"Authentic wood fired pizza and it was delicious. We went there to take our Granddaughter who said she wanted pizza for dinner. Can't say no to our Granddaughter. So, the place was full except for the bar that is next to the oven. What a thrill to watch two guys work in tandem to make the pizza. That by itself was worth the cost. However, the pizza did not disappoint. The crust was well done and the ingredients were fantastic. Overall suffice to say that we will go back over and over again."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  Was craving pizza in my area and wanted to try something different and stumbled onto this place.  Nice quiet easy going environment inside.  Staff was very friendly and helpful over the phone.  They have a nice styled oven right by the bar that is the highlight of the place.  The bar has some good beers on tap and wine all over the place.  The pizza was extremely flavorful and delicious.  I was impressed from the first bite on.  Highly recommend this place, will be my go to pizza spot from now on."}
{"text":"Fantastic and Authentic Pizza! Best I've found in Arizona. Hands down my new go to pizza joint!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today after seeing a bunch of signs everywhere around the area and thought I should try it out So I came in around 3:30. I Ordered the Margherita pizza to go along with the parmesan fries. I had to drive from Warner to Germann so the noid got to the pizza, but it was still pretty tasty. We will try this place again, but we'll be eating in next time. The Parmesan fries were not too amazing, but the kids loved them. Looking forward to coming back to try a few other menu items. Nice Oven Guys"}
{"text":"The is the best pizza in Arizona Period!!! I am an east coast girl !!!!!! This place is a my favorite place yet in Chandler . I have the Flavor-town I recommend it"}
{"text":"First time here tonight celebrating a special occasion with the hubs. We started off with the Rosemary bread and olive oil. Then we had the Margherita and Pepperoni (they use sopressata) Pizzas. Absolutely delish! The crust was soft and chewy and the sopressata was perfectly spicy! Owners and staff are super friendly. We had the pleasure of meeting Cherie who help us out with recommendations from the menu. Def enjoyed everything about this place. Will return."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza! And the salads are really fresh. You also can't go wrong with one of their pastas. Everything at this place is literally made from scratch. That's hard to come by."}
{"text":"Had an all around great experience at Bella Gusto! My Husband and I were seated right away and had nice customer service all night! White sangria was delicious and refreshing! We ordered the Burrata, Cacio De Pepe, Pepperoni pizza and Affogato.... All amazing! Loved every bite! Local to the neighborhood and will definitely return! Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"You know you had an amazing meal when you get home and crash for 30min. Carbs and cheese induced naps are the best!  It was a sunny Saturday afternoon and it was well past lunch but too early to be considered dinner time.  A hungry Joyce W. stumbles around after running around doing errands.  Sure, a box of doughnuts awaits her at home but she wanted something cheesy.  Did I want pizza or a thoughtfully presented cheese and charcuterie board?  After a quick Yelp search, I realized I could have both.  Bella Gusto popped up and I figured it was time to try this bookmarked spot.  After taking a gander at the menu, we settled on ordering their Signature Formaggi & Carne Boards ($18) and a Sicilian rossa pizza ($15).  We also used the Yelp check-in offer for the free oven-roasted focaccia that we ended up being charged for but we were so full and impressed with the food that I ended up paying the $4 no questions asked.  So let's get into it:  * Oven-roasted focaccia ($4):  This flat bread had rosemary so is it considered \"focaccia al rosmarino?\"  Who knows and who cares.  It was delicious!  I had stolen the side of the table where I could see the wood-fire oven.  I watched a gentleman light up the oven, press the dough by hand, plop the dough on the board, shimmy it in like a veteran stripper [had I sat at the bar, I would have made it rain on this guy and his sexy bread], and pull out a giant fluffy pillow of carbohydrates a few minutes later.  A side of olive oil accompanied the bread.  You know what makes a good restaurant?  The amount of love that goes into their house bread.  This shit was boss.  I wasn't even embarrassed doggy bagging this home with my cheese and charcuterie board because it was that damn good.  * Signature Formaggi & Carne Boards ($18):  Our board had three cheese, three meats, and a side dish of toasted house-made bread.  They also offered beer mustard and a chutney.  This was seriously the most beautiful cheese and charcuterie board like ever.  There were two types of salami, prosciutto, beautiful slices of mozzarella, Parmesan, and some other cheese that I gotta admit I wasn't too fond of [it tasted too sweet for my liking].  I instantly gravitated towards the salty and granular Parmesan and the salted cured prosciutto.  Delicious!  * Sicilian rossa pizza ($15):  Meatballs, spicy soppressata, ricotta cheese, oh my!  Once again, I creepily watched the guy stretch the dough by hand, work his magic, and slide it into the oven.  I also saw him push it to the other side of the counter, walk around, and graciously dressed the top of the pizza with olive oil.  Yas, yaaaaaaaaaaaaas!  The hot ricotta led to cheese drag action which later led to getting slapped in the face with burning hot cheese but whatever.  Eating the pie hot was good but eating it cold in the glow of the refrigerator was amazing!  The crushed peppers they use are also spicy, fragrant, and pretty damn good.  Bella Gusto is a 4.5 stars place but .5 stars don't exist in the World of Yelp so 5 it is.  It was a strangely erotic late lunch and I can't wait to go back.  Is this how it feels to be a voyeur?  Show this place some love, y'all!"}
{"text":"This place is SO DELICIOUS! Seriously, and everything is homemade.  The sauce and pizza is delicious.  I just got back from Italy, everything here tastes authentic.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic craft pizza, salads, wine.  Great for groups (private room) or just dinner.  Family friendly.  Love this place so much we made it a regular meeting place for our school group(s).  Great for Mom's Night Out, date nights, happy hour."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious...authentic and the service was great. Had the white pizza with prosciutto and arugula, followed by the affogato for dessert. I will surely be back, great find :)"}
{"text":"This place was really great, and very happy it's in Chandler! When we arrived we were greeted and sat right away. We were so surprised that they weren't very busy for being a hot and new restaurant in the area. The ambiance could use some work but maybe they're still working that out. We started with our free pheasant bread and it was amazing. My husband asked for some garlic and they brought him fresh minced which he loved! Next we got the house salad and it was perfect! Would get this again without a doubt! Next we had the Tuscan Village sausage pizza. The dough was very good however I can not say the same for the very bland tomatoey red sauce or the very bland sausage. Sausage had like no flavor or fennel or spice and tasted like the kind from the store in the tubes. Next time we go we want to try the burrata and calamari and will probably get a white pizza. I will update on our second visit! All in all and excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing wood fired pizza!! Great happy hour specials! Love this little family owned place"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't gone to this place before.  My first time we went was only 2 weeks ago, and I was craving it so we went back last night.  I love their house bread because the dough is amazing, which in turn is why their pizzas are so good.  So far we have tried the Phoenix and Gusto BB salads, both are delicious.  Burrata was also delicious and came with a crusty yummy rustic bread.  We haven't tried the paninis yet but based on what I saw, they are quite large.  Thumbs up on the Chicken Marsala and the other pasta dishes that I sampled from our friends, were also on point. The Santa Merda pizza is amazing, we had to order it both times.  We also got the Meaty pizza, but the pancetta was \"funky\" so that is why we are giving a 4, plus the ambience is a 4, not a 5. Now to desserts; gelato & cannoli are very good but if they have the tiramisu as a special, you MUST get it!  Can't wait to go back and try some more of their items."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times now and have always had great service and food.  The pizza is traditional wood fired, so it is thin crust.  The sauce and other toppings are fresh and delicious.  The pasta is amazing too."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! My work is only two miles away, so it's very convenient and delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here today for Valentines Day!!! Simply just amazing!!! Shared an incredible Caesar's salad. You must try the House Bread it's the best bread I have ever had. My wife ordered the pepperoni pizza and I ordered the 4 cheese white pizza. Great atmosphere for Romantic feel. Insider special--- every Wednesday is $10 pizza day!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza from Napoli...at least it tastes like it! Absolutely the most outstanding pizza in Arizona for sure !!! Everything is so fresh and the taste of the sauce is..like Italy! We have also had the braised beef... crazy good and such a good deal for happy hour. My dad is from Italy and has guided food tours (as a travel agent) throughout Italy. I will definitely bring him here next time he is in town. Its so hard to find that particular Italian taste in America. Well they have it! Everything we have ordered has been incredible! Try the pasta too! Definitely eat it in so you have a nice, fresh, crispy crust pizza, straight out of the wood fire oven!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, beautiful interior. Went here for date night with my husband. The rosemary focacia bread was amazing... Could have just eaten that all night. The pizza we had was great... Had a little spicy zing. Ordered a large Caesar salad and were able to share it.   With be coming back to try more. The owner said they will have seasonal changes to the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! I had been craving a thin and crispy crust pizza all week. I had a horrific experience with Jimmy Joe's  in Mesa. One of my Phoenix Coworkers suggested Artisan Pizza and This is just the place. First time trying margarita pizza"}
{"text":"When was the last time you had some good wood stove pizzas? My last time was during my visit in Rome, Italy a few years ago. Craving for some good authentic pizzas (specifically the one made with wood stove), we did a yelp search and found this gem. It is amazing how many times we drove by this place and never even notice its existence.    We started our meal with bruschetta as the appetizer. Their bread was made in-house and the cheese was simply amazing (and I am not a fan of cheese). The portion so was generous that I was already half way full. The pizza has a thin crust with quality toppings. I literally watched the chef making the dough and put the pizza in the wooden stove.  Our waitress told us that the restaurant was opened by two gentlemen over a year ago - one of which studied Italian food at different restaurants over the years. The exterior/interior might not look as fancy as Olive Garden or other franchises, but they chose to put their money and effort into the qualify of the food. They also sell their own bread/cheese that are made in-house. Shortly after our conversation, one of the owners even came out to say hi to us.   I am a big fan of supporting hardworking family/friends non-chain establishments. Truth been told, their food are simply amazing! If you are in the area or if you are a big fan of delicious authentic pizzas, I highly recommend you to give this place a try. If you prefer Dominos or Pizza Hut types of pizzas, please....go somewhere else. You have no idea what you are missing.   P.S. They have $10 pizza every Wednesday."}
{"text":"I was super excited about trying this place out after hearing good reviews on social media. But I left very disappointed. The pizza was good. But the service we got was the worst ever. We were only a party of 2 and the place was half empty when we got there. We waited over 20mins for our pizza when other tables that order after us got their pizza right away (one table even order 3 pizzas way after we placed our order and they got their pizzas way before us). I saw them putting a pizza in and I called our server over and ask her what was going on and she was like oh it's coming out now. I asked her if that was our pizza they just put in and she said yes sorry. It only took 4-5 minutes to cook it. When we finally got our pizza our server never came back to our table until the bill was ready- it would have been nice to have gotten a refill on my drink to have it with my pizza. We paid our bill but on the way out I spoke to the managing owner who was nice and tried to offer a coupon for next time, but I refused it."}
