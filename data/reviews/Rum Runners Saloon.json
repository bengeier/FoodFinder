{"text":"Just moved into town and food was great but most impressive was service was fantastic. Thank you Stephanie"}
{"text":"I visited Rum Runners June 21 2015 for the first time and I was surprised how nice this place was. The restaurant is quietly tucked away in a residential area on Babcock Boulevard in Ross Township. Rum Runners is a new establishment that was once a small pizzeria and is now remodeled and expanded to accommodate a full service restaurant, bar and dance floor area. There are 2 1/2 floors where the 1st floor has 2 subdivisions, one being the dining area having big screen TV's and the other side is the bar area which has plenty of booth seating. The second floor is large and the layout is beach bar theme that feels open to the outside whenever the retractable perimeter windows are open when weather permits. The half floor at the top is more like a private loft looking over the dance floor and appears to be used for a more private party or a place for a DJ to setup equipment. I also want to mention that patrons can play pool, darts and video golf. Also, the food was decent and the portion size was more than enough for a hungry appetite. The food was reasonably priced. I would go back there again."}
{"text":"Ate in the bar.  Had a fish sandwich which was just so-so.  The French fries taste like store bought frozen fries.  Nothing spectacular!  The homemade chips were stale.  I think they had been sitting around for a couple days!  I was not impressed !"}
{"text":"Great food. Great upstairs deck. Great ambiance. Great place for Football and sports watching. Unfortunately the bar stools were extremely uncomfortable.  Need to be replaced ASAP.  This place would be a 4-5 star if the sitting stools were comfortable and had a middle peg to rest your feet."}
{"text":"I think this place changed hands. The \"new\" menu is boring and lacking in significant choice which they had been great at prior. Had horrific experience tonight. Went at 7pm on Sunday eve. New chicken wings are the big type smoked. There were undercooked and gross. Non-apologetically the waitress offered to take them back and change to something else. Two of our orders didn't come out (including the sub for the wings). I pulled the plug and asked for the bill. They tried  to charge me for the food we didn't get, but took them off when I said something. Lastly service was awful secondary to an \"all hands\" staff meeting that was occurring in the bar where staff were being told the virtues of upselling alcohol drinks and how that would contribute percentages to their pay. The \"old\" Rum Runners was fab. I will usually give a restaurant a second chance to recover from a bad night. But this experience was pretty egregious. I think I'll give them a couple months to work out some thought kinks and hopefully put together a new menu."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant with its strengths and weaknesses. Some things were delicious, others not as much.  As I entered the restaurant, I got that American feeling I was expecting. There is a visible bar and a coloring contest for kids.  We were seated on the first floor, which is full of windows with a nice view. There is a nice modern feel to the space, but one let down: Ads on the tables. You get used to it, but still, REALLY!  When we ordered our food, the staff was nice and patient. They gave us advice and suggestions. I appreciate that. Knowing the staff knows the menu is great.  We ordered the Nachos for an appetizer. Besides paying extra for meat, it was chips with hot cheese and melted mozzarella. Very average in my opinion.  I tasted the smoked wings with a few sauces. Though the smell may turn off some, they were pretty good. They come with homemade chips which are also tasty.  The highlight of my meal was the New Orleans Style Shrimp. Yum! They were perfectly cooked and seasoned. They were just good.  The worst dish in my opinion was the coleslaw. It was watery and bland. Go for the fries if you want a side.  They are also expensive, so bring cash!"}
{"text":"If you want excellent food and a great environment, you have to go to Rum Runners. Everything we try is tasty and high quality. AND if you want the best service ever, go before 5 PM during the week and sit in the bar (there are nice booths there, too!). Cheryl will give you the attention that customers deserve. We actually only go to eat when she's working."}
{"text":"The big thing here is that the food was just good. Nothing stuck out. Burger was prepared well, just not enough flavor.  Regular wings were pretty good. And the Apple quesadilla was great. Fish tacos, bbq burger just weren't worth it.  Management and wait staff were excellent. We did not ask for anything off of our bill, but  the manager took money off.   I wish I could say we would be back, but we will probably stick with the north park lounge."}
{"text":"Very nice selection of casual food.  The lobster roll was delicious.  I have attended a few impromptu work events here.    The area upstairs is a nice place to have a party .. pool table ... lots of seating ...  reasonably priced drinks"}
{"text":"They changed their menu recently so there's basically nothing on it. I got Mac and Cheese and my brother got fish and chips. It took 46 minutes to get our food and both came cold with the fish and chips cooked beyond what anyone would want to eat. If you want a place to sit and drink I guess this is okay but don't bother going for the food."}
{"text":"I love that they have drink specials, along with a great selection of drinks! Their food is pretty good as well. The parking can get a bit tricky on busy nights."}
{"text":"I was so surprised that I loved this place! With the name, I expected a cheesy theme restaurant. But it actually was not! We were seated on the bar side, and the wait staff was very good. Could have definitely used a bit less lighting, it was very bright at our table, but honestly that was my only minor complaint. I had a Reuben wrap that was excellent! All the good flavors and ingredients of a Reuben, but without all of the mess! The waffle fries were very crispy as well. As an app we had fried pickle spears that were just delicious. Rum Runners had a smaller menu, but everything on it was something I would get. Will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"The burgers were very good, steak sandwich was very tasty and tender but the bun needed to be toasted as it said on the menu, it was dry and i think would have been good if grilled. The milkshakes were too thin, like chocolate milk and the service was a bit slow, we waited about 15 minutes before anyone even greeted us at the table. This was our first visit and we will give it another try."}
{"text":"Resturant is ok.  Seems family friendly and service is good.  Menu is quite extensive and specializing in rum cocktails (prices not on menu). However, everything we had was VERY salty so beware....even my date who likes a little salt agreed ."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken nachos on the newest menu. They were very bland. I plan  on trying other items on the new menu, hope they are better. Wish they would just adopt the north park lounge menu and call it a day"}
{"text":"We love Rum Runners!   My family went here for the first time on a Sunday. Kids eat free with the purchase of an adult meal on Sunday's...bonus!!!  The prices are reasonable, but the alcohol is a bit pricey. The rum specialty drinks are $8 each. However, they were quite delicious.   The menu is quite large with a variety of options. The house salad is my favorite! Silly, I know. But, it is the most unique house salad I've had. It has corn bread croutons (yummmmm), corn, cheese, and rum tomatoes in it. The rum tomatoes are OUT OF THIS WORLD! I was thrown off guard when I ate one because I had never had one before. They are sweet tasting and the server said they are boiled, and then soaked in rum and brown sugar. Did I say yummmmm?  Then there is the buffalo chicken flatbread. O-M-G. (I got it without the scallions) Holy heck this is the reason my husband and I will become regulars...it's just so perfect. The crust, the cheese, the chicken, the sauce, and the homemade ranch it's served with. I got it as my meal and had I half left to take home because it's huge! If I were to guess, I would say it's about 15 inches in diameter. Try it, you won't be disappointed!!!  The atmosphere is great. Lots of televisions to keep the sports fans entertained. The kids get a picture to color and they hang it on the wall before they leave. There is a bar next to the dining room and another bar upstairs.   Overall, it was a great experience and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our dinner group (13 ladies) ate there on Thursday night. Disappointed in the small menu. Expected to see actual dinners but there were none. I chose the Swiss Mushroom Burger without the bun. It came with waffle fries and a pickle which I declined because of being on a no carb diet. The waitress asked if I wanted a salad or green beans instead of the fries. I chose the beans which were fresh and seasoned very well. When the check came, I was charged $2.00 for the beans! Couldn't believe it! The waitress led me to believe the beans were substitute for fries. So for $16.50, I just had a hamburger, without bun, and green beans. Another lady chose the salad in lieu of fries and she was unhappy that she got charged $2.00 for small salad. Waitress should have told us we would be charged extra and there was no way the beans or salad were worth $2.00! Not returning."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, but it disappointed yet again.  The first time I had the lobster roll which was not good. It had no flavor and was expensive.  This last time my mom & I shared spinach & artichoke & buffalo chicken dip. Both were awful and we could barely stomach them. If we were not hungry, we would have left it. The spin dip was slightly more edible. The buffalo chicken dip was an absolute joke. They basically just put cream cheese in a dish & covered it with cheese and a few chunks of chicken. Disgusting!  My husband had the meatloaf and he actually enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This bar is extremely close to my house but I never go because of such terrible service, choices & prices. Since it is under new management now they removed the surfboard of drink specials and only had 1 bottle beer on special for a Friday and that was it. We ordered breaded pickle chips to munch on but they had a weird sweetness taste to them. We opted for homemade chips since the kitchen was closing soon. The chips were just regular chips with seasoning on them and were $7! They use a pour system for the liquor drinks so they are very week. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I go to this place quite a bit, usually every Sunday from September - January as they have the NFL Sunday Ticket. The food is good, I usually stand by the Steak Sandwich if I am going for dinner (It's an actual steak that they slice up) or one of the appetizers if I'm just munching while watching sports.   The beer selection is pretty good, they have an automatic pour line for their liquors, so the bartenders have to follow specific guidelines. Staff is friendly, food is good. Nice spot."}
{"text":"The best way to describe Rum Runners Saloon is by calling it a good suburban bar.  Some people might view that as a negative.  I wouldn't blame them since I find myself mostly frequenting city establishments.  But sometimes it's nice to go back to where you came from.  I've been to Rum Runners several times since it's opening and enjoyed it.  I've been here with different groups of friends and we've all found it to meet our needs for the night out.  Sometimes you just want to meet friends for a casual drink.  I found the downstairs perfect for that.  There are also tables for dining and TVs if you're there to watch a game.  If you sit at the bar, I found the bartenders are quite attentive.  Upstairs has more of a club feel with band or a DJ on weekends.  It can get crowded so getting a bartender's attention can be a challenge.  Overall though, whether upstairs or down there's a chill vibe.  Drink prices are average and there are daily specials.  Depending on the entertainment, there might be a cover charge.  But worth checking out if you're in the North Hills."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the upstairs bar. I am from South Florida and I really miss the open air dining.  The service was slow but polite. The upstairs was under staffed for the number of patrons. They have a happy hour menu without prices on it. I like knowing what the happy hour specials are. The menu is limited. Originally I thought the prices were high for what you got but then I saw the portions. They were huge. The food is excellent."}
{"text":"Very limited menu. Service was horrible and the place was not even crowded. We had to ask the bar tender for drinks and menus. The worst part was not receiving an itemized bill. Not happy about that. Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Monday Night is Wing Night! Amazing new flavors. Options of fried or smoked wings. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Rum Runners is owned by the same group that owns the North Park Lounge and Cabana Bar. We've only been here for lunch and dinner service, but they have a large 1st floor bar and whole second floor dedicated to night life. Their menu is pretty expansive and there's something there for everyone, including the legendary Lounge Fries smothered in cheese sauce and bacon. They have an awesome quesadille stuffed with chicken, feta, and apples, as well as a pretty delicious chicken wrap with apple slaw and bacon jam. Their fries are plump, but still crispy. During lent, we came here for their fish sandwich which was average at best, so I don't recommend them for lenten season! The mac n cheese is delicious and the sauce is so smooth and cheesy. Kids also eat free on Sundays with the purchase of an adult Entree."}
{"text":"I go here occasionally because it's close to work and there's a lot of room in the upstairs bar if we want to have a medium to large group for happy hour. Their snack/bar food is generally fine, though I haven't really had much experience with their newer menu. Nothing exceptional, but fine. My biggest complaint can be described in three words: Weak. Ass. Drinks. When you order a mixed drink (my poison of choice is vodka + soda) they use some sort of weird tap system to measure out your liquor, which I assume is programmed to under-pour everything since I can never taste any vodka in my drinks AND I can drink SEVERAL and not even catch a buzz. Just last night I was there for a party, had 3 double vodka sodas and...nada. Nothing. So if you want to pay good money for weak ass drinks with practically zero alcohol in them this is your place.  Beer list is ok, so...there's always that, I suppose."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection and ok prices. Good appetizers but the main course food was very tasteless. Service was mediocre. Eventually the waitress stopped coming to the table even though we were a 15 top amd spending a lot of money."}
{"text":"Got a burger to go and it was delicious. Convenient location for Ross townshipians and easier than trying to get 5 guys at the mall."}
{"text":"I was pretty damn happy with my lunch here. Came in on a Wednesday around Noon, sat at the bar, and ordered a straightforward cheeseburger and fries. They had three lunch specials (burger was not one of them), which I assume are different each day of the week. Anyways, the burger was juicy (asked for it medium) and apparently a mix of ground chuck and brisket. It tasted perfect; exactly what you're looking for out of a burger. I think the fries had a hint of cheese and garlic on them, and there were more than I could finish.  There are two levels. The downstairs is a large bar with plenty of TVs and some booths along the walls. Behind the bar is a dedicated restaurant area with several tables and booths. Don't be afraid to take your kids to eat here, you'll be fine. The upstairs has another bar and a few stages for bands and DJs.  The bartender was nice and attentive, and the manager checked in with me as I was eating to make sure everything was OK. Super nice! It's fantastic to have a new place in the area and I look forward to coming here on a Friday or Saturday night with friends sometime to see what it's like."}
{"text":"Was there last night for the first time and ended up with food poisoning - from I'm assuming the chicken fingers - also had French onion soup and French fries - cannot recommend"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Good drinks, there is a bunch of beer options and rum of course! We had  the fish tacos and quesadillas, they were good. It seems like a solid choice for happy hour due to the deck.    Much needed for this area as there needs to be more options!   I'll come again and refresh review after I try dinner."}
{"text":"Good bar with good bar food. They have decent drink specials daily. This is a good local bar to frequent."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  Went for lunch with friends. Prices high and everything is extra. I got a cobb salad. It had 2 slices of bacon a hard boiled egg and 1/4 of an avocado and spring mix that was gritty.  $9 if yoy want a protein its extra. My one friend was thinking about a fish sandwich.  Then noticed that it was listed as fish and chips under sandwiches,  but you had to pay a dollar for the bun. All sandwiches and wraps come with waffle fries if you want any other side it is $1.99. If the prices were reasonable I guess that would be ok but they are not. This place has changed hands recently and really gone down hill."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere upstairs, music, dates, nice size bar. Sometimes can take a while for food, and portions are off"}
{"text":"Rum Runners' Saloon is a restaurant that I, as a graphic designer, am wary of: it's a place where the branding doesn't exactly match what you get inside. I'm new to the North Hills and have passed this place a few times, but have always neglected to go in because the exterior has a giant Captain Morgan statue and screams, \"LOUD PIRATE-THEMED BAR I WOULD HATE EVEN IF THE FOOD IS GOOD.\"  Luckily, that is not the case.  My mom and I went in on a Tuesday or Wednesday night, I believe, fairly recently, around 6:30 PM. When I went inside, I was surprised - it is way less pirate-y than the name (and giant wooden barrel affixed to the side of the building) would entail. We were immediately seated in the left portion of the restaurant, where there were ample tables/booths. Huge TVs and a nice fireplace surround you. It honestly looks more like a fancy Italian restaurant than a 'saloon.'  Again, the whole time I was thinking that it would be some noisy, smoky, boys' club kind of place, but with garish pirate decorations and sub-par pub food. I was totally wrong. The menu could use some variety in my opinion, but what I found on it was pleasantly surprising.   Both my mom and I could tell that Rum Runners values quality ingredients. My mom started with an ordinary house salad, but this was elevated by some unique additions: rum-soaked tomatoes, as well as cornbread croutons, and corn salsa. Really interesting, and really good. We also shared a unique appetizer: grilled, not fried, chicken wings. Our waitress, Katie (who was terrific!) explained to us that they make them by smoking them for hours on end and then finishing them with a nice chargrill. Now, for a person who typically uses wings as a litmus test when I'm trying a new restaurant, I was tempted to order the regular ol' fried wings. But these things were fantastic. The meat literally falls off the bone, and just like our waitress said, you don't even need a sauce - nay, I would recommend NOT getting any sauce - because they are just so juicy and tender. Amazing.   My salmon salad wasn't anything totally unique, but it was delicious. It was definitely at least a 4-5 oz. portion of fish. I think my mom had a ribeye and shrimp, some kind of surf and turf, and she loved it. We both were full and had extras to take home.  The manager was visiting tables and we didn't hesitate to tell her that Rum Runners was completely not what we expected, for the better. I will have to go back on a weekend where it might be a little louder and more hectic. Perhaps my review would change then. There is a big upstairs area where I think they have live bands/DJs/etc. I'm sure at that point it will become more of a typical bar atmosphere, but for the food, price, and space, I can deal with it. Rum Runners was a hit."}
{"text":"Saturday night decided to come here with my family there were 7 of us... walk upstairs sat down waited 20 minutes no bartender or server comes up to us. There was an empty bottle of beer on the table a waitress comes over grabs the empty beer and walks away didn't bother to ask if we needed some service HELLO??? So we walk downstairs to maybe get some service we sit down after 20 minutes now down here we ordered our food but still have no drinks.... horrible service for a Saturday night that is not even busy... there are two tables in the entire downstairs dining room. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Very good food and large quantity. Excellent French onion soup. One of the best we have ever had. Big hambugers. The smoked grilled wings are really yummy and the rumshakers BBQ sauce was awesome. The cod was really good as was the the reuben. Only complaint was the green beans were a little under done and extremely crispy. But other than that I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, to go with my friends to watch games or dinner and drinks. We went there this past weekend and I was very disappointed. They had a live band that was playing way too loud at 7PM; my friend and I couldn't even talk over it so we left. They also changed the entire menu and took off their best appetizers and sweet potato fries. Do not think I will be returning as the atmosphere just isn't the same, such a shame!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Thursday night with my wife for dinner.  We had been by Rum Runners a number of times before and had always considered stopping but never really had.  So whenever I saw that Rum Runners was in the Enjoy book we decided that we had to go.  The inside of this place is absolutely massive and I was able to see a huge bar area before heading into the dining room.  The dining room actually ended up reminding me of the North Park Lounges with the huge number of TV's displaying all sorts of sports and then the ads that were wrapped on the tables.  So I ended up being only midly surprised whenever I opened my menu and saw that they were a member of the NPL group.  Besides all of the sports bar like items in the dining room they also had some barrells on the walls which I believe were supposed to be rum barrels in homage to their name.  For dinner my wife and I decided to start off our meal by splitting the Bavarian Pretzel Sticks as an appetizer.  We were under the assumption that since it was happy hour that they would be $5 since it was still during happy hour.  Instead they were full price which I only found out later whenever I asked about happy hour prices in the dining room.  The pretzel sticks ended up being quite good as the outside of them were covered in salt and had that nice tougher outer layer while the inside was soft and doughy.  What really made these good though was the homemade beer cheese which I could have eaten on pretty much anything.  In the end I thought that the pretzel sticks were a bit overpriced for what you got ($8 for 3 pretzel sticks and the beer cheese and honey mustard dipping sauces), neither my wife nor I were not sad that we ordered them.   Then for my dinner entree I decided on ordering the Horseradish Pork chop.  The pork chop was an 8 oz chop and came with cheddar mashed potatoes and green beans and a salad to start.  As is always the case whenever I order pork out, I was concerned about the kitchen overcooking it.  I think that more restaurants need to realize that pork can be pink as long as it hits a certain temperature.   The salad ended up coming before the meal and was a decent salad with the most memorable part of it being the croutons which seemed like homemade cornbread croutons.  Whenever my entree came my fears were realized as my pork chop was very well done and tough.  It was a shame too as I really loved the horseradish crust that was on it.  The cheddar mashed potatoes were similarly a letdown as while they were creamy, I didn't really get any cheddar taste out of them.  For me they should have just been called mashed potatoes while noting that some cheddar was added to them.  Last but not least was the green beans which were actually quite good.  I normally am a fan of my green beans being a little crunchier and while these were definitely on the softer side, I still really enjoyed them.  The bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.  If there is a next time I will be sure to sit in the bar area to get those happy hour specials and I hope that their food is able to live up to its potential."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife on a Wednesday night for dinner.  We were looking for something different and fun, and I had been here for drinks on one other occasion.  The upstairs is a really cool open area that is great in the summertime, but tonight we stayed downstairs in the main dining area.  There are plenty of TVs around and the decor inside is a little more classy and upscale than your typical sports bar.   They were running a Wednesday craft beer special so we decided to indulge in a few beers.  My wife decided to get the smoked chicken dinner and I went a little off the map with some chicken tenders and fries.  Each order came with soup or salad. I decided to get the spicy sausage salad which was awesome! It was like a spicier stuffed pepper soup with sausage instead. My wife thought her wedding soup was alright and wished it had more starch. Chicken tenders were alright; it was nothing special and was a generous portion which I was able to take home for a second meal.  This is a pretty neat place to go for drinks.  The food here is acceptable but the atmosphere is definitely sports bar.  It has a classier feel to it and would be a great place to go out with friends for drinks.  There is a good chance I'll be back here soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and it has always been a rather good experience. Whether stopping for drinks or food or a combination of both, I've always walked away happy.  They have pretty good drink specials but I'm not overly impressed by their selection of craft beers. It's not a deal breaker by any means but is one area I could see for improvement. I've had a couple of their burgers which were all good and the fish sandwich. Note that you can get the small or large. Of course I'd go for the large.  This thing is massive! Check out the picture I posted of it!  It in no way fits on the bun but that is just fine. The house made dill tarter sauce hits the spot. I even liked dipping my fires in it.  There is an upstairs and downstairs area. I've always ended up going upstairs.  There is a bar along with table and high table seating. I've never seen it overly busy though it fills up nicely on nights that they have a DJ.  The service is so-so. I've never had bad service but I have had times where I'm waiting around or things seem to take longer than they should. And then there are times where you just feel like you are another butt in a seat.  But a few of the waitresses have gone above and beyond constantly interacting with our group.  Those are the nights that Rum Runners really shines. As a local watering hole, this is always a viable option in my book!"}
{"text":"We used to love Rum Runners, but they've changed their menu a few times now and the food has really gone down hill. The upstairs bar atmosphere is fun in the summer when they open the large windows though. It's a shame because we used to love this place but have been disappointed in the food for a while now!"}
{"text":"We came Sun afternoon, it wasn't busy. Our server was friendly and accommodating.  The restrooms hadn't gotten the towels and TP refills installed yet (ostensibly from being busy  prev nite ST Paddy's), but all was fine otherwise.  They did let us substitute roasted asparagus for green beans which were fantastic!  Food took  maybe 40 minutes to come out, but again, our choosing maybe b/c roasting veggies takes time. Also enjoyed the portabella sandwich."}
{"text":"I enjoy the idea of the nice little family restaurant on the first floor and a bar in the first room, a second floor bar and high tops with a little dance floor and Dj on weekends. The crowd is is pretty relaxed and there are many TVs throughout the restaurant. The second floor had a Cali theme to it, with a long board as a drink sign, the palms on the bar roof, a wooden balcony and garage door Windows to open when it's warmer out.    We sat at a high top on the second floor. It was quite crowded, resulting in a wait to get a server of 10 minutes. The menu has plenty of food to choose from. This made it harder to choose what to eat! But as soon as we put our order in, we only had to wait about 15 minutes for our food to come out. The server was very nice and ended up being very attentive throughout our meal.   We ordered the Reuben and fries, also comes in a sea food version, a regular cheese burger and fries, a firecracker app (stuffed fried flour tortillas with chicken, roasted tomatoes corn, black bean salsa served with pico de gallo and sour cream), and a steak salad (with tender steak, fries, iceburg lettuce, and blue cheese, however ordered ranch to come with it). The fries were my favorite type, crispy and not flimsy!    The over all experience was not bad. I will like to come back again and try out the downstairs dining room with the kids and see how that turns out!"}
{"text":"I have been back a few times since my original visit and have always still had a consistently nice experience all around. I'm usually here to watch a game given the amount of TVs so I'd recommend coming here for that as opposed to a quiet casual dinner date since it can get noisy. The draft list is still fabulous,packed with IPAs and other crafts. Other menu items I have tried since the original review are: 1. The grilled chicken wrap (Grilled Chicken, Cheddar Cheese, Granny Smith Apple Slaw and Bacon Jam) $8.99 2.Pulled pork sandwich (Pulled Pork, Rum Barbeque Sauce,Beer Battered Onion Straws and Jalapenos. Served on a Grilled Brioche Roll) $9.99 3. Buffalo chicken flatbread (Grilled Chicken, Cheddar, Mozzarella, Provolone, Crumbled Bleu Cheese, Scallions and Buffalo Ranch Sauce) $10.99  The grilled chicken wrap with the bacon jam (because bacon makes everything better haha) was probably my favorite with the pulled pork (since that's kinda my thing) was a close second. Everything is appropriately priced so this makes for an inexpensive night out."}
{"text":"We had the smoked chicken salad and the lobster roll.  My husband liked the salad, I thought it was WAY to smokey- like liquid smoke.  The lobster roll was more like lobster salad.  Big chunks of carrot and celery and nasty mayo, all on a hard roll.    Service and drinks were good and reasonable   We may try it again"}
{"text":"Great band...they were called networkrocks. They played songs most people would know and love, but never hear covered. The bar was ok. The service was awful though. We waited for at least 10 minutes to get our first drink order. Nice beer list.  Get some more attentive bartenders."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, my boyfriend got the buffalo chicken flatbread, and that was SO good! Its about the size of a pizza, and of course he had to eat almost the whole thing so I only got 2 pieces lol. I got some type of chicken pasta with \"Alfredo sauce\" which definitely didn't taste like Alfredo sauce, but it was still really good. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Ok, I figured I would give this place another try.  Maybe they had an off night when I was here last.    I have to say that the food tasted better this time and it didn't smell bad but the menu options are tiny.  I was hoping for a good salad for lunch but a basic salad is $9.  If you want a protein it is an add-on.    I ended up with a burger.  It was ok, a bit undercooked, but tasted ok.  It came with waffle fries that were crisp and tasty and a pickle wedge.  They seem to have a good beer selection, but I guess unless I want to drink there is no reason to come back here."}
{"text":"I didn't care for this place too much. Not vegetarian friendly, so I ate a baked potato & green beans. The beans were at least fresh & not canned. My group ordered the loaded frie2d with bacon on the side to accomadate me & they came to our table covered in bacon. It took about 20 minutes for them to get our appetizer& they weren't that busy. Didnt even ask them to fix the issue because no one wanted to wait another 20 minutes to eat so i just didn't eay them. It looked like there were only 2 people working there & they seemed kind of overwhelmed. I ordered a cocktail that wasn't very strong & for some reason cost $7.50,. That's an acceptable price for a specialty cocktail & it just wasn't up to par. A friend that I went with really loves this place, but it's just not for me I guess. Casual atmosphere, kindof a sports bar. Could be fun if you like watching sports & like very basic food."}
{"text":"Smoked wings are amazing. I believe Monday night is wing night. I've been here for lunch a few times and have enjoyed it. The chicken fingers and fries platter is huge. Definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"So we made a first trip to Rum Runners after a failed family outing trip and just kinda ended up there because we were hungry. Small family of 3 and our little one is only 1 1/2 yrs old. So this was a Sunday and the place was pretty empty, only 3 other parties were in at this time. A bartender/waitress asked us to seat wherever we like. (She looked to be the only one at that moment.)   They were super patient with our daughter who can be loud and high pitch when she gets excited and food excites her. So we ordered the Belgium pretzels and beer cheese. Order came out super fast along with my salad and we ordered our 3 meals.   Pretzels were very good, but the beer cheese was chunky and lacked flavor.   We waited what felt like a very long time with a toddler, for our food. After 3 parties who came after us got served food, then we got ours.  Once it came out my meal was actually really good I got the Fried half chicken mashed potatoes and green beans. Perfect temperature, chicken was moist and good. My potatoes were a little on the cold side and the cheese was just congealed onto them.   My husband had a different meal experience. He got a burger, I honestly forget which one. He was very disappointed in it. Very bland, dry and just over all blah idea of a burger. He was happy with the portion size and his fries but that was really it.   Over all yes, we will be returning. We seen a couple menu items we are interested in trying. Also would like to try some of their cocktails. We are unsure if something happened to this place as we just moved here a few months ago, but when we used to pass it was always so packed and it just surprised us that the waitress seemed stressed with just a few tables and some bar guests."}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian, take a pass. There are no entrees, no sandwiches, I think one appetizer (nachos?) and there was one flatbread. Awful menu choices. You can piece together a couple of sides, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Ive been here about 4 times and service is usually at a ok scale. Tonight was different waited a good 5+ min on a slow rainy night. The food was ok. I think the lobster sandwich is way too salty and at the end of the night it takes the bartender a good 10 min just to cash me out. then i decide i want a smoke with 3/4 of a glass of beer full so i put a napkin on my beer to go out side. was gone for maybe 2-3 min to come back to my glass gone.... im sorry but its not rocket science. if you cover a drink its a red flag for DO NOT TOUCH MY DRINK im coming back. Dont think ill be back i can get better service elsewhere"}
{"text":"Nice place. Bartenders were very friendly and attentive. We had quesadillas while sitting at the bar. They were very good and not to pricey. For a new place they seemed to have it together.  Only gave 2 stars because we only had one appetizer."}
{"text":"I went to Rum Runners to see the Band Mercedez!  Great Band!  The restaurant is down stairs and they have an upstairs where they have a nice big bar and some tables and a stage for the band to perform!  I can't wait to go there  on a nice warm summer evening because they have these big garage doors that open up to the outside when its warm.  They do have a lot of tvs for sports fans also!  I wish I remember our waitresses name because she was very nice and kept checking with us to see if we wanted anything !"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this place to join a meet up group. It is basically a sports bar with TVs all around and table service  Our group leader ordered us some great appetizers including steak salad, pizza, and a few other things. For lunch I decided on a cooked salmon salad. The lady across from me had the New Orleans' style shrimp. Mine was very good.  They have various games you can play but basically it is a  place to hang out with friends when there's a big sport's event going on. They do have Wi Fi for free but it is not very good."}
{"text":"New menu was announced with much fanfare several weeks ago. Not sure why they would be proud of it. It has been dumbed down considerably. There is now almost nothing on the menu that requires a knife and fork to eat. It is all sandwiches, wraps, and their \"gourmet\" mac & cheese. Gone is their signature lobster roll sandwich, and the choice of sides has been greatly reduced and is kind of weird. Only waffle fries, and a few vegetable choices such as green beans, carrots & cauliflower.  The quality was also down. I was there with the old menu (did not review at the time) and had a burger. Ordered it under the new menu and it wasn't good at all. Tasted like the pre-made types you get at the supermarket meat counter. And I asked for it medium rare and came out close to well.  We arrived early on a Saturday evening (probably around 4:30) and there were only a few other tables. But it still took a long time to bring out our food.  I guess they are trying to concentrate on the bar/nightclub business as this new menu is definitely geared towards people who are looking for bar food to eat while drinking. But even that doesn't make sense as they took off sides like onion rings & sweet potato fries and replaced with carrots & cauliflower! I would not go back if you are looking to have a decent meal in the suburbs especially if eating with your hands isn't your thing."}
{"text":"Went here this past Friday for happy hour. We have been here several times, but this is my first review. They have the best happy hour in the area and daily specials. Corona's are $2.95 all day Friday. I can't remember all of the specials, but I believe all drafts are half off from 5-7pm. It's also a great place to watch a game as it's spacious enough to accommodate large crowds. They were very nice when we called and asked if children under 21 are allowed upstairs during happy hour. When we got there right at 5pm they were a little under staffed, but more help came as the night went on. We ordered several appetizer specials during happy hour for our table of 8. Highly recommend it for happy hour and to watch a sporting event. There are always daily specials as well as the best happy hour around."}
{"text":"Don't order the Po Boy hoagie ! My sandwich had 3 popcorn shrimp on one half and 2 one the other.  Really disappointed with it."}
{"text":"We always go up to the bar area.  Decent drinks and responsive staff.  Their nachos are great for bar food and a very large portion.  It's usually a mid 20-30's crowd and great for sports."}
{"text":"Just hosted a birthday party for my wife in the upper room of Rum Runners yesterday late afternoon and early evening. We had the whole room to ourselves for a group numbering over 60 people. There was plenty of room to mingle and sit, even for energetic grandkids. Our food was from the Banquet Menu. The chicken tenders, meatballs, small sandwiches and cheese plate were delicious and plentiful. The veggie tray was smaller than I hoped it would be and I wish I would have ordered two. We were able to bring in our own cake and cookies. The planning staff was very helpful beforehand. The service staff were excellent. They were quick, friendly, and helped make the event a fun time.  Thanks Rum Runners!"}
