{"text":"I can not give this place any stars I order today online at 11:00 o'clock for a 12 deliver time here it is 1:45 pm and still no food and trying to speak to them is like talking to a deaf person ...OMG yes this is one hawrgy mad women"}
{"text":"Best Japanese food in NC.Wish i lived closer so i could eat it everyday! Anyone who doesn't like this place has something wrong with their taste buds."}
{"text":"Worst japanese food ive ever had! Starting with the wierd lady who served the food...shrimp sauce was more like sweet and sour sauce it was red instead of the normal orange yellow color..soup tasted like hot water..food was extremely bland..the only decent thing we had with the entire meal was the sweet tea. We definitely will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant at their old location. Since they have moved the food is not very good, the shrimp sauce is watery and the carrots are no longer sweet. The restaurant itself is a very nice and a friendly atmosphere however because of the flavorless food it is not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"I went here last night for the first time and ordered the Snow White Roll, add mango, Onion Soup, Spring Roll and a side of Vegetables. 

Needless to say- I would not come back here. Though my roll was good, I ordered it with mango, it contained no mango. The Onion Soup was very frothy and had no flavor. That's my favorite soup and this one was not enjoyable. The Spring Roll tasted of a frozen product. The ends and inside were very wet as if they were defrosted before being fried. The vegetables were good. 

Additionally, I picked up my order at about 8:45, right before closing. The woman at the register was so rude. She continued to count down the register, which took about 10 minutes, as I stood there waiting to have my order handed to me. I had already paid online. The customer service here is not good and the food isn't either."}
{"text":"I have eaten here regularly since they opened. The range of selections on the menu is great, and everything I have tried has been excellent. The staff is very friendly as well. Don't hesitate to give it a try."}
{"text":"food was not bad (for the price) the sushi tasted fresh and fast delivery too. BUT. They didn't send a small container to mix the soy sauce and the wasabi, I asked for then to send plates and utensil for the rice, and none of those made it. If you know you are delivering to a hotel, have some common sense.."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place. The food is good, & I had even initially given it a 5-star review. However, after three incorrect orders, we can no longer support the restaurant. I am allergic to soy sauce, and getting my orders wrong, after always confirming the order and making sure they understand the allergy, is unacceptable. I always order the shrimp hibachi with steamed rice & no sauce. After bringing my food home tonight, I had to call to tell them about yet another error with my order. In spite of prior congenial talks about the other errors, this time she argued with me & told me to come to the restaurant to pick up new rice (I can't eat the shrimp anymore because the rice is in the same container, so that does me no good). When I told her that I would not drive back & forth again, how many times they had messed up our previous orders, & that I always confirm the order because of my allergy...she still argued, insisting many times that I had ordered fried rice. I told them I will not eat there again, which makes me sad because I enjoyed their food - when they got my orders right. Maybe I should have checked my order before leaving the restaurant, but I really shouldn't have to."}
{"text":"Never ordering delivery from here again. 

I placed my order and it said it'd be about 40 min. To an hour.  Okay cool.  An hour and 15 minutes go by and I called just to see if they were on their way or to see if they couldn't find the building because my apartment complex is a little tricky.  

Any who, the lady answers and I explain to her that I placed an order and wanted to check the status. she starts asking me for my information and proceeds to ask me what id like to order .... 
I explained to her multiple time that I ordered it already through Eat24.  I don't think She understood because she said it would be here in 30 minutes. 

she calls me back telling me to cancel the customers order and that she never received the order.... I explained to her that I am the customer.   She asked me if I wanted the food still, that it would take 10 minutes, faster delivery.   Well, I've already been waiting for about an hour and a half. -_-' 

Took 20 minutes for the food. It was not bad. It's actually pretty good for the price but it took almost 2 hours to get the food. 
The guy that delivered the food gave me a free spring roll ......  I don't like spring rolls but I guess the thought counts.    

But all in all it was just horrible service."}
{"text":"Everything was TERRIBLE!Just because you put sauce on the meat doesn't mean it's seasoned.Literally the most bland food I've ever had in life.This is not hibachi.Spring rolls were soggy.Food will be going in the trash,better that than to have a stomach ache"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and the staff was very polite.  However the food tastes bland.  A woman sitting at the table next to me threw her plate away and said to me \"Your Sushi looks delightful, this Hibachi was horrible\".  I let her know the look was far from what this tastes like."}
{"text":"I will never order from here again in my life. I understand that these people are running a business but when I say these people don't care about their customers, it's the under statement of the century.  I have been a loyal customer since I moved to this side of town about 1yr ago. This would have been the second time this week I would have had take-out from this place. I called in my order and was on the way to go pick it up when I got in a car accident. As a courtesy I called the resturant  and advised the girl that answered the phone I had been in a car accident. Mind you my kid was hurt and crying in the back ground. So you know what this chick said to me. \"Your order is ready, you have to come get it\".... Are you kidding with me??? I said it again because I thought she didn't hear me. She said the same thing again. Clearly she didn't care about me or my kid all she heard was money going away and didn't want lose a profit"}
{"text":"Went based on great reviews. My sister and husband got a few rolls that looked good and they said it was ok. My girl friend and i got nigiri, tuna, salmon,  and snapper. Worst nigiri I have ever had ever. Waitress asked if we wanted a box for what was left. I had told back from laughing. Saki  wasn't bad."}
{"text":"The food is nasty and not worth your money! I just ordered from here Friday and it was the worst hibachi I ever tasted!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were so excited that a Japanese express restaurant opened nearby. We were even more excited to see that they were offering 20% off of the entire meal for their grand opening special. It was very clean and the staff were very friendly. I had the bento box (steak hibachi, spicy tuna roll, squid salad, and brown rice) and my girlfriend got the hibachi chicken. The portions were of great size and the food tasted amazing. The steak was cooked medium well and the chicken was not undercooked nor overcooked - just perfect! Our only complaint would be the shrimp sauce. The consistency was a little thick and more on the sweeter side, and I do not feel that the one dram cup was enough for the amount of food they gave us. Overall, I think this place was great! We definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"I have only tried their hibachi, but it is really good and very reasonable priced for hibachi ($9 hibachi combo). It is mostly a take out place (hokkaido japanese Express) but does have seating and a small sushi bar if you do eat in. We order hibachi combo with no rice, extra veggies, miso soup and ginger salad! Yum! The rice is okay but nothing amazing, and get the miso soup, the clear soup is very bland. Their hibachi is always good and the staff is always friendly.  Which is a plus and keeps us coming back for sure. While eating in one day, I noticed that they do have a lot of regulars and the staff knows them by their names! :)"}
{"text":"I want to give the restaurant another chance,  but can't.  They have messed my order on three separate occasions. And although they corrected the orders, I had to be go back to the restaurant.  I mean three times. How does that happen? They are never busy when I go in...so how can you mess up the order?   The food is just okay.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"The people who work there are very nice but I've never been so sick in my life after eating here. Stomach virus for literally 4 days that started about 3 hours after I left. Absolutely never eating here again. Beware!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've only ever gotten takeout from here and it's always great. Food is great staff are friendly,polite,and helpful. All together great place."}
{"text":"Placed a delivery order, it came within a reasonable amount of time. I got some sushi that I really enjoyed but I will agree with some of the comments about portion size for the dinners. I definitely want to order some sushi right now that I'm thinking about it. I definitely will give this place another go. I also believe the price point is correct."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I visit this place about once a week. The staff is curt, but polite. Service is quick which fits well when you're on your lunch hour. The dining room is bright and modestly furnished. It reminds me of a pizza or burger joint. The hibachi items have always been tasty and cooked properly. The sushi is made fresh and is on par with some of the more expensive places I've tried. I definitely recommend trying it at least once to decide for yourself."}
{"text":"I don't think the lunch experience this place provided me warrants a 1 star review..but just barely. I placed 3 orders of nigiri - yellowtail, tuna and salmon roe. The fish had definitely been laying around for a while, the rice was not fully cooked and was doused with too much vinegar. My guest's shrimp tempura noodle with yaki soba came with three over-fried shrimp and salty, dry noodles. I get it - the model is to offer cheap ingredients (not food) and express service. However, that doesn't excuse a poor, half-hearted execution = two stars."}
{"text":"I don't suggest the bento box. Wasn't a good deal in my opinion. But food is good, and other specials are good portions. Also customer service is good, the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"Friendly, clean, and delicious. My husband's order want exactly right and my food was kind of cold but, we don't regret going. Very fast also!"}
{"text":"This review is not so much about the food as it is about the owner (or at least I think he is the owner).  My wife got a roll that was supposed to have shrimp in it and had crab instead.  She asked about getting a credit for the roll.  The owner started yelling at my wife that she was just trying to get something for free.  She just asked for a credit for the wrong roll delivered.  He kept yelling at her that she was lying and trying to get something for free.  She told him to go to hell and left.  
The jerk is lucky that she didn't have a food allergy.  Serving the wrong kind of meat or seafood can get you into a world of legal trouble these days.  So, I don't care how good the sushi is at this location, their customer service is some of the worst I have ever encountered.  Will NEVER be back and will encourage others to go elsewhere! (have already warned a LOT of people I know, work with, etc.)."}
{"text":"Language barrier
Was told had ranch when ordered salad with meal but then told no when served. Served a ginger sauce with salad that tasted more like sesame/teriyaki.
Hibachi chicken was dry, no real flavor.
Hibachi steak chewy and charcoal 
Shrimp sauce had a thousand island taste.
Maybe first day jitters!
Everyone was very nice!
3 stars for trying."}
{"text":"I got suckered in....they're new and offering 20 % off on your entire purchase. 

What did you expect? I'm a foodie. 

Anyhoo.....Since they are the new kids on the block, the place was empty when I arrived, a quick check of the menu and I knew I wanted to try the Filet Mignon hibachi. It comes with your choice of rice (brown, steamed, fried) and a mix of broccoli, carrots, onions, mushrooms and zucchini.

I didn't have to wait long for my order which was impressive since I assumed they prepare each order as you request it. I opted for to-go and the presentation still looked good when I got home. 

The steak was okay (I'm being generous), not quite cooked as I requested and it was just lukewarm and could have used a tad bit more seasoning. But I managed to eat it. The veggies were cooked really nicely though (by far the best part of the meal). The rice was awful. No flavor or veggies and it was cold. Yuck. No, thank you. 

They have a pretty decent selection of sushi, so maybe I'll go back and give that a try and update my review based on my next visit. 

But for now, I'll pass Hokkaido...."}
{"text":"Always great! Vegetable fried rice is my personal fav. They also have these homemade donuts for dessert--- you HAVE to get some-they are amazing! They are located in a strip across from the mall. The inside has beautiful chairs and benches. Very clean. You can also watch the chef/cook make your meal because the kitchen is behind a glass wall."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant. Great service and good food.  They are giving 20% off for their grand opening."}
{"text":"I got takeout today for the first time and I was VERY pleased.  I got the Hibachi steak and shrimp with a salad and it was DELICIOUS!  I'm not a fan of the shrimp sauce as it's too sweet, but I didn't care cause I keep Shrimp Sauce on hand from Makoto's Japanese Restaurant and Sushi bar in Boone, NC.  This is now my new go-to place!"}
{"text":"After sitting down halfway done with my soup, I look down to find a black hair. I stoped eating and didn't say anything, once our food came out I was eating and looked down and found ANOTHER black hair in my chicken. I took it back and they sent out another, once we put our leftovers in the box another person I was there with found a hair on their plate. I would not recommend this place, the food wasn't even that good."}
{"text":"Hokkaido is awesome and has great food, I don't care what anyone else says. They are one of the two go-to Japanese places I have. The other is Tsunami and although it's delicious, it is expensive and more of a sit down type and I almost always get my food to go from Hokkaido. Anyway, Hokkaido is moving to a new location, lucky for me it is just down the street from where they were, still off of Hwy 29 where Hwy 73 ends and turns into Florence St. I'm sure with a larger location they will get tons more business. You certainly can't go wrong eating here. My previous review was in January of 2012, and this is still the best, super affordable, tasty and yummy Japanese food place around."}
{"text":"Gave it a shot and ate there during dinner time.  The decor of the place is spartan, not a whole lot to look at.  The menu features the basic Japanese express type food, with Hibachi or Teriyaki flavor.  They also have a mini sushi area and serve sushi, didn't try it.

I got the Hibachi Steak with fried rice and water.  The price was $10 plus tax, typical price in Charlotte.  For the water, I got a small styrofoam cup, which is fine.  After a few minutes, not long, the food is ready and comes on a disposable plate with plastic fork and shrimp sauce (white color).

Despite I ask the steak to be medium rare, it was more medium well.  The fried rice is the usual you find anywhere else, it had a slight crunch to them and bland taste; I suspect they have been sitting in the rice cooker all day.  The steak is mixed with the vegetables and swimming in sauce; I ate the food by fishing them out and onto the rice before eating the food.  The overall food was bland and the shrimp sauce didn't do much to it; added soy sauce in the rice section which did help though.  The steak is a cheap meat, with some griddle in it.  The mushrooms were oddly big and uncut, didn't really feel like chomping them; the other vegetables were fine.  After the meal I had a strange film in my mouth that was unpleasant, possibly from the shrimp sauce.

In the end, I was unimpressed and didn't think the food was worth it.  Staff was nice, but if the food is just blah that its not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"I want to recognize the owner's of Hokkaido.  I am new to Charlotte, and I went to get something to eat for dinner.  It was extremely late approximately 9:30pm.  They close at 9:00.  I was pulling up and getting out of my car when the lights inside went off.  The owner comes walking out, and sees me.  He then proceeded to turn around turn the lights back on and fix me a meal.  I told him that he didn't have to; however, he was avid on making me what I wanted.  This is quality customer service, and I will be visiting many more times in the future!"}
{"text":"Went to dine in and try sushi with my sis. We checked off the paper sushi menu and paid at the cashier. The young girl was a bit rude. :/

Service: an old woman took care of us though we weren't asked about our drinks until the very end either. Nonetheless she was very sweet. 

Sushi was okay. But out of the ones we tried, I do not recommend the Naruto roll as cool as it sounds.. It just doesn't work."}
{"text":"So I didn't have high expectations for this restaurant because generally speaking express Japanese places aren't the best. However I just wasn't cooking tonight and I've been craving some food like this for awhile. I ordered a takeout order for the house and here's how it went. I ordered teriyaki chicken and hibachi steak and it came with veggies and fried rice. My chicken came hibachi instead of teriyaki so I wasn't thrilled about that however it wasn't bad. Basically your typical fast food Japanese. We also got the Phoenix roll, the dynamite roll, and a spicy tuna roll. Apparently sushi is buy 2 rolls get 1 free... That earns a star right there!! The sushi was grocery store quality with restaurant prices. That was a little ehh but for a quick fix it did the job. The point is if you go into this place knowing it is a fast food Japanese restaurant you won't be disappointed because that's exactly what you're going to get. I give three stars because there were some glitches in my order and the pricing is a bit steep even if you get a free roll. I'll probably try it again at some point... They are still new so it could get better!"}
{"text":"Food was not good. I got shrimp and chicken hibachi and I couldn't eat the chicken or the shrimp. The shrimp was overly salty and the chicken..didn't taste like chicken. Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Pricing is high for what you get. Watch what you order vs. what they charge. Otherwise a decent takeout place."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here for years.  We really loved the laid back atmosphere of the old location but continue to visit the new location fairly often.  My wife has a dairy allergy and it's the only Japanese place we can find in town that doesn't put butter on everything before or while they cook it.  They also have no problem of handling her request of everything being cooked in oil while on the grill.  We both appreciate the lean cuts of meat on the teriyaki and hibachi chicken.  We will certainly be back again."}
{"text":"They do a pretty good hibachi meal. I love being able to get delivery hibachi in steel creek. There aren't many good options out here. I'm used to living in the South Park area - I took for granted how all the delivery there was excellent. Most of the options out here are not good. I've had food poisoning twice since I've moved to steel creek. Hopefully this is a sign that the delivery in steel creek is getting better."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ordered the chicken and steak and scallops and steak for dinner. I would never eat here again. The steak tasted like it was old and the rice was disgusting, how do you mess up rice? We couldn't eat anymore after a couple of bites."}
{"text":"My husband and had lunch on Saturday at Hokkaido Japanese Express after a quick trip to Wal-Mart. It's by the Wal-Mart garden area and two doors down from Luigi's Pizza. They offered 20% off your entire order (Grand Opening Special). We had a variety of sushi and a few appetizers. It was fast,fresh and pretty good. They also offer a basic Hibachi menu. It's a little family-owned business with a friendly, clean atmosphere. They even have a little sushi bar with stools. I counted 97 different types of sushi from their take out menu!!! The Shrimp Groza was amazing. The Neon sushi was awesome. The fried rice was so-so. This is a very casual place with paper plates, plastic utensils and a few vinyl booths. If you are in the neighborhood, looking for something fast and like sushi it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Sushi was great and they delivered faster than the expected time given. I would recommend this as a go to for lunch especially if you are looking for them to deliver to your office."}
{"text":"Huge portions of perfectly seasoned meat and Their shrimp sauce is off the hook. The veggies are fresh and it's a great healthy lunch/dinner option. I've been going to this place for 10 years. Even though they changed their location to a more decorated spot, it's still owned and operated by the same family."}
{"text":"This was my second time getting food from here and the food was even better than the first time!  I bought the chicken and steak hibachi with steamed rice and veggies. Everything was seasoned perfectly! Steak was cooked to perfection. I will definitely be going back and also will be taking advantage of their delivery service."}
{"text":"There are not a ton of Asian/sushi places in Concord.  This place is by far the best.  If we want sushi or hibachi, and do not want to drive to Yama or into Charlotte, we go here.  Consistently good food."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Ordered On yelp, food was delivered very fast. Not to bad in price for hibachi! I ordered the steak & shrimp dinner, miso soup, and 2 spring rolls. Will be ordering again for the sushi!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Ordered the shrimp shu mai for an appetizer and sushi for our entrees. Shu mai was different than I've had it at dim sum-crispy on the outside not steamed- but this is a Japanese restaurant not Chinese. The raw fish was fresh and they gave us huge slices for the nigiri! The rolls were delicious as well. We went away with bellies full for under $45 for two people and it was really good-yes! We will be back"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and I'm always impressed with how friendly the staff is. They make me feel welcome each and every time I visit. The chicken wings are super crispy and delicious, the hibachi is never overcooked, and the sushi is quite tasty. We had 6 rolls the other day and enjoyed all of them. I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews and hope they will give this place another chance because they seem to genuinely care and want your business."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the back parking lot of Walmart is a gem of a Japanese restaurant that you wouldn't expect to find in this area. It is family owned and staffed, and they are from Hokkaido Japan, thus the name, and assures you that when you want Japanese food, you are getting Japanese food, made by real Japanese people. So often you find an \"Asian\" behind the counter or in the kitchen and that is where it ends, but to the travelled foodie it isn't enough.  If I want authentic Italian food I want an Italian preparing it, not a latin looking dude from Greece or Mexico. So on to the review. The service is very good, very polite and attentive, however, they could brush up on their English some in order to avoid confusion when ordering. Again, family run so their options are limited until they can hire professional front staff. In the long run it will help them greatly. The food is outstanding. The Sushi/Sashimi is fresh, tasty and properly prepared. The rolls could be a bit bigger but are equal in size to the price so the ratio is spot on. The Japanese food is very good, although catered to the average American taste (Teriyaki, Tempura Udon, etc.) so don't expect anything unusual or traditional Japanese or any Hokkaido style foods or recipes. The staff is so friendly and nice and will bend over backwards to make the customer happy. They also have very nice daily specials like \"buy any 2 sushi items and get 1 free\" and there are no special rules, so it is easy on the wallet. I really hope they are able to catch on and stick around for a long time. This area needs places like this.."}
{"text":"Very impressive!

This place goes the extra mile.  I am very happy with  my  meal.   Very underated.  Very  glad I stopped in."}
{"text":"Damm...
 
               How is this place open? One a paper plate with a plastic fork and a paper napkin so cheap it smells like oil you are served boiled chicken, boiled carrots, rice and thousand island dressing that they call \" Fish sauce\"  
                There is maybe 20 places to eat in the busy busy block across from not only a mall but, a hospital and a million Drs offices . Come on how many Chefs and restaurant  owners would want this location? I guess the only reason that they are open is there are a thousand people going wanting lunch or dinner so they can feed you what ever it is... 
                 And then there is always the next person to come in \"sort of like the Walmart mentality\""}
{"text":"Amazing good tasting food and a great price. Totally worth every penny and the service is awesome the owners are good people. It's a family friendly environment and clean. My top choice for quick japanese food."}
{"text":"Pros: Fast delivery of food, lots of menu options.
Cons: Small portion (I had the Bento box), high price considering portions and quality, food lacked seasoning.
Next door is a buffet. For the same price you can get all-you-can-eat food of nearly equal quality."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places. The waitresses and sushi chiefs are very nice and the food are amazing the fish kutsu, chicken kutsu, honey sesame ck etc are all very good. Sushi is very good and fresh."}
{"text":"I went there after I left a part time job on that side of town. So glad I found this spot. Went in was very glad it was a very clean, nice comforting spot.  I usually just order and eat in my car, but I decided to stay and eat there. I ordered steak fried rice, which I never had before, It also came with chicken wings, which were cooked crispy and they were really good. For the drink of choice I had sweet tea. First the food was so good, very tasty. And the sweet tea was like I would make it, sweetened just right. I will be going back to this spot to enjoy the tasty good food again. I even recommended it to a couple of friends. Also the price was good considering they gave me enough food to eat the next day. Which I did, and it was still delish!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for quick order Japanese. They have a sushi menu and various cooked dishes, so everyone should be able to find something that they can eat.

I chose the chicken teriyaki bento box, going with crab salad, california roll and brown rice. I could hear the chicken start cooking as soon as my order was placed, so I know it's fresh. The crab salad was surimi of course. Topped with spicy sauce and on top of a tangy vinegar, it was pretty good. The california rolls were nothing special. The chicken was fresh and hot with some onions and broccoli mixed in and sesame seeds sprinked on top. Brown rice was not very fresh (a little crunchy), but it was 4 in the afternoon.

Over all, a reasonable meal. Even when the 20% \"grand opening\" discount goes away, it's not bad. It's certainly fresher and probably healthier than the buffet at the other end of this little building."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 4 and placed the order. Asked for some crab Rangoon for appetizers and our food finally came and still no appetizers. My buddy seated next to me, went to eat his Chicken and broccoli and a piece of hair was hanging down from his fork, wrapped around the broccoli. He showed the server and she acted like it wasn't a big issue and asked if he wanted something else and if so, he would be charged. We were blown away by all of this. The food was cold for some reason and the server brought the bill before we were even finished. I told the server, don't worry about the appetizers that they didn't bring us and they said they forgot them but on the bill had charged us. I would recommend to never go to this place for anything. A waste and a dump. Poor service."}
{"text":"wow! this place is definitely the place to go for some high quality awesome tasting sushi. i've had a lot of sushi from a many different places and this one is definitely in my top 2 of favorite sushi places. i will add that it does take longer time for them to hand roll each order of sushi, so yes people who order simple hibachi chicken or whatever will get their food before you. things like that are cooked quicker than it will take for special hand rolled sushi especially fried sushi. it's just the way it goes. the service was great the staff is super friendly and attentive. we will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. Best Japanese in town. They've always had great, fast service. My side faves are the donuts, cream Rangoon and sweet tea. The atmosphere has changed a lot over the years, now being more modern. I also enjoy being able to see the cook do his magic on the grill."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ordered this for dinner approximately a week or so ago... Wow is all I can say. The wings had a distinctly odd flavor, hard to describe as if the grease was old or something.  The wing were NOT crispy very soggy as if they had been sitting for a while. 
My daughter ordered shrimp fried rice.. Be warned they use (smaller than small shrimp) the rice was extremely sticky. 
I ordered steak and shrimp fried rice. The dish was oddly flavored and rice was NOT FRESH. 
It had taken an hour to get the order (which is understandable... but i wasnt about to eat it so i called i simply wanted a refund.  Well in order to get a refund i had to wait for the guy to come get my food.. which ok.. poor quality. Hmmm the food was horrible and you question if i was telling the truth??? I even said my daughter will eat hers i don't want mine and these wings taste weird so im scared to eat them and those were the 2 items i wanted a refund for.  He said i will come check to make sure you didn't eat it. ... then ill call yelp eat to verify if you can get a refund.  
I said ok come get it. Irritated was not a way to describe how i felt.  It was 9pm at that point. 
By the time he had gotten there my daughter decided she definitely didn't want hers either. 
When he got to my house he opened every single box and said why did you bite two wings. I said to make sure it wasn't just the one that was bad... 
Wow.. not a way to treat customers.. i asked him if he was satisfied he said ill give you a refund im very sorry..
I thought to myself.. what im sorry for is the way you handled this... 
I will NEVER EVER go here again... 
Absolutely the worst delivery experience I have ever had. Extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of a quality family restaurant. All the workers are all friendly and polite and do their best to remember the orders of regulars. I always get the hibachi steak with broccoli and the volcano roll and I've never once been disappointed. Even the owner will make sure to greet my husband and I if he is not busy. Also, the shrimp sauce is divine; perfect consistency and sweetness by far the best in town."}
{"text":"I prefer to take shorter lunches so I can get out of the office in a timely manner so I am always looking for a great quick lunch option in the general area. Hokkaido has some potential but my last visit was not phenomenal. 

I walked in not far past 11:00am and waited an awkward minute or two for someone in the empty store to come to the front. The woman who did was cheerful and took my order with no problems and the food came out fairly quickly.

The disappointment arose when I returned to my desk to find what I think was hibachi sauce everywhere. There was sauce at the bottom of the bag, in the sushi and in the salad. I kept the food level while I was driving so I am not sure where the massive sauce exodus came from but it put a damper on the whole meal. 

Some of the items in the bento were better than others. The worse was the salad I think because the sauce had drenched it and given it a weird vinegar taste. The rice was underwhelming plain fried rice with a couple peas and carrots throughout. The steak was pretty good as was the broccoli and mushroom but I swear I must have had a whole onion in the mix! The spicy tuna was the best of the bunch even with a little hibachi sauce soaked on the bottom. 

This place is close and the price wasn't terrible so I think I will go back and try an order of hibachi chicken and an order of hibachi vegetables (hold the massive amounts of onion!) to see if the experience is better when there is no possibility for cross contamination. I also might pick up the buy 2 get 1 free sushi rolls for dinner one night."}
{"text":"Since this place has opened, they've cut some corners that are hard for me to ignore.  The chicken is no longer tasty or good.  It has that odd texture from really cheap chicken, you know what I mean?  The texture is wrong so they overcook it so the customer ends up with very little broccoli, lots of onions and hard little chicken-like chunks.  The \"Shrimp\" sauce is now simply watered down thousand island dressing = yuck!  The portion of rice has vastly increased while the portions of vegetables have decreased.  The little carrots are tasty, too bad I'm only getting 4 of them now  :-(  

Then there's the drink issue- their tea isn't tasty so I'm forced to drink a soda and on a few occasions, the soda machine has been inoperable so I'm left with paying a full drink price (just to get the cup) but only getting water  :-(  When I tell them the drink machine is malfunctioning, they don't offer to refund my drink or anything, they just say \"ok\" and put a sign on it.  How does that actually help me, the customer?  Let me answer that:  It doesn't help me at all.

I was so excited to have a fast Japanese option when this place opened, but it hasn't taken me long to tire of what they're serving  :-(  It's a shame."}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, delicious. Yes, it's on styrofoam plates, and have plastic forks...no problem, tastes great and is fast! Always nice staff too."}
{"text":"Hokkaido is my go-to for good takeout hibachi and sushi. Tucked away in the back of the strip mall; it can be hard to find but once u try it you will probably like it. Service can be somewhat slow at times but that's all restaurants at some time or another. Portions are large and pricing is right in line with other restaurants offering the same dishes. Clean front of the house and restrooms as well."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It's close-ish to work and I love a good good hibachi chicken plate for lunch. It was okay. It's in a strip mall, and the food is quick. I had the hibachi chicken with fried rice. 

The chicken was okay. The sauce was ...different. I like a really light, clean taste with fresh veggies. It was just...off. The veggies were plentiful - unlike what other reviewers have experienced so maybe they're working on veggie portion size.  

There was plenty of rice - very plain but edible. 

Service was nice and attentive. I wish them luck, but don't think they will be around long, and doubt I would visit again. Overall, edible and extra star given because veggies were fresh and crisp and service was good. Iced tea was good as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant was not very pleasing the didn't have my hot sauce the steak didn't taste all that great they did try to fix it which was good but still left a bad taste in my mouth I probably will not return to this restaurant.."}
{"text":"Background my boyfriend is a former hibachi chef and I used to a work at a different Japanese Express. So we can be kinda picky but tbh this place is overpriced for the quality of the food. The rice was extremely dry almost like it wasn't cook. I could not even finish my food bc the rice was so hard. On top of that the \"shrimp sauce\" didn't really taste like it at all it probably could have used more mayo it taste more like sweet sour sauce. The only reason why I am giving it 2 stars is because the sushi was actually pretty good other than the presentation and price. I personally thought many of the rolls were pretty pricy for a Japanese Express joint but maybe it was pricy because they are offering 20% off? I'm gonna cut them some slack because they are new but dry rice is a deal breaker for me. I will not return."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff, good sushi, great mix of sushi offered.  Add to your local sushi craving needs."}
{"text":"I usually only get the hibachi steak & chicken with sweet carrots and mushrooms and Hokkaido Japanese Express does this perfectly. It comes with the house soups (beef broth with scallions and tofu) and fried rice. The new location is great and seats more people as well. Give them a try when you're in Concord."}
{"text":"Le sigh .... Wait this is Japanese not French . 

Gosh I gave this spot 2tries , my first was good...got everything I ordered and the taste was yummy enough for me to come back , but unfortunately 2stars. 2stars because the service is great but who's cooking the food? I think the entire hibachi chicken dish was swimming in water which made any attempt for the flavor to cling to the chicken and veggies hard. Even the shrimp sauce tasted different, there wasn't a taste at all the second time . Usually you can drown the unseasoned food in mounds of white sauce but not here :( . I'm just heart broken , will there ever be a good hibachi take out in Charlotte? Will my urges for soft steamed rice , moist seasoned chicken , crisp , & bountiful veggies stirfried to perfection ever be served on a whim? I hope this owner taste the food and will try to remedy their meals before another one bites the dust ."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new Japanese restaurant so we had lunch here. Had hibachi chicken and steak and a spring roll. The food was very good and cooked perfectly. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this spot the other night for dinner. We were the only patrons. They must be busier at lunch time. I was actually glad to be the only people there because we got to chat with the sushi chef. He was really great to talk with. Very approachable and friendly. 

We got the caterpillar roll, Hulk roll, and phoenix roll (chef's favorite). All delicious especially the Hulk. The house salads we got were ok. The dressing was really good, but the salad itself was small and very simple. I was here a few months ago and ordered the salmon teriyaki and it was really good too.

We got one of our rolls for free. I think they are running some sort of special. 

So go check them out for a casual but delicious meal. They have something for everyone."}
{"text":"Boooooooy... don't even get me started. 

So first of all, sometimes DO NOT trust your Facebook friends' suggestions. I asked my friends what some good Japanese places would be in Charlotte and overwhelmingly, they said Hokkaido. Note to my FB friends, some of y'all have absolutely NO TASTE TBH. 

Y'all... the food was just NOT GOOD. The shrimp looked like the shrimp in the blue/pink bags at Walmart. The GREAT VALUE bags of shrimp. Not the name brand. Ask me how I know.... I BUY THEM, but when paying for a $18 meal, included with soup and salad, you just expect a bit more QUALITY than Great Value can bring to the table. The chicken had been microwaved and I DO NOT eat microwaved chicken because it gets tough and rubbery. The portions were big, but nothing can bring you more disappointment than a large, EXPENSIVE plate of old, soggy shrimp, day old chicken, and re-re-refried rice. 

Then y'all the shrimp/white sauce... I turned the cup over and whatever was in there STAYED in there. White sauce is supposed to be a slight bit runny. Not Speedy Gonzalez or Usain Bolt runny, but also not thick and gloppy like Flubber. 

When I left, the cashier had the nerve to say \"we deliver too.\" Girl, you shouldn't...

Threw those cards in the T-RASH."}
{"text":"This place was just barely ok. Food arrived cold and missing dressing on my salad and no extra soy sauce. I ordered the Lunch Bento Box with Shrimp Tempura. They gave me 3 soggy small shrimp, tiny salad (no dressing) 3 small pieces of Fantasy Roll which what basically a watered down version of a California roll, minus the cucumber and avocado. It also came with more white rice than anything else. I also ordered pan fried shrimp gyoza, which is probably frozen out of the box. They were small and pretty much tasteless.
The convenience of delivery was the most appetizing thing about this place. Origato."}
{"text":"The food was good. I really enjoyed it. Very nice atmosphere for a Japanese express.. Will be returning"}
{"text":"Wow I find the family that runs this place very nice, and I love supporting family owned businesses, I cannot visit here again simply because the price you pay is not worth what you get. I've eaten a lot of sushi in my life, and I've never thought highly of sushi places that put avocado instead of fish on top of rolls. When you ask for a rainbow roll it should be covered from left to right completely with fish. This place unfortunately uses way more rice than should be allowed. I wouldn't take so much issue with the fish and the rolls if the prices weren't so high. I might do it for lunch real quick but definitely not a place I would like to repeat often."}
{"text":"Honestly, for a quick Japanese place, it's pretty good. I enjoyed the chicken and shrimp hibachi. My only complaints are portion and the sauce. I felt like they could have made the entree portion size a little bit bigger especially since the rice portion was a lot. The sauce wasn't bad. Not what I expected but not bad. I want to try their sushi so I'll return."}
{"text":"I got the Shrimp & Chicken Hibachi combo. The rice & veggies were all good. The shrimp had to be canned cause it was very little. Chicken tasted horrible. All the combo is is soup or a salad. I got a salad. No dressing. I paid $2 more for 3 thin sliced cucumbers & a bowl of lettuce. The drink is not included.  Over all I paid $16.24. NEVER AGAIN.  Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant and then they moved and completely changed their look and how the restaurant was ran. The prices became more expensive and they changed the type of food they served. Highly disappointed in the location change"}
{"text":"The people are friendly, but the prices are way too high for the amount of food given - at least on the sushi side of the menu."}
{"text":"Food wasn't the greatest. They charge for extra sauce. Delivery was fast. Over all experience wasn't the best. Won't recommend to anyone."}
