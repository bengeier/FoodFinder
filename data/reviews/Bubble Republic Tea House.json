{"text":"This BR location is a favourite amongst many! I find that I always end up here if a bunch of us can't decide where to go but just need something to drink!! I've been here a few times but I'll go through my latest visit briefly.   Most of the time I visit, it's packed and overflowing with people but recently, it was nice and quiet inside with only two other small parties present. I think most people come to BR for the bubble tea but maybe haven't thought about trying their food....I'd recommend it! Despite the fact that their portions have gotten smaller over the years, the food is pretty solid to pair with your drink. You can get a plate with or without making it a combo (a small flavored black/green milk/no milk tea and $1.25 extra to make it a large). This combo only includes certain sections of their drinks menu so make sure of your selection with your waitress!   We both got the sesame paste noodles and our drinks were Magik Milk Tea (black milk tea with coffee flavored jelly....but I think there's other coffee flavoring in there too....ordered large tapioca) and Vanilla Ice Cream Black Milk Tea. To finish off with dessert, we shared brick toast with condensed milk (so good).   Food and drinks came pretty quick, the brick toast took a little longer but nothing unreasonable, and we were offered a sample of passion fruit green tea (must've been a one time thing but I'm glad I was there to try it!). All together, it was just under $25. Regardless of how big the crowd is, all employees are efficient, friendly and work quickly to get your orders in.   NOTE: this location is part of a strip of stores undergoing exterior construction so it can be easy to miss! Keep a good eye out if you're coming!"}
{"text":"I mean I guess if this was the last BBT place in Mississauga, I still probably won't go. Harsh but true story. This joint is probably one of the better BBT in Mississauga but that's only because all the other places also suck that much more.  I used to go if I was unwilling to drive upton but as of lately, I have no interest in going to BR since discovering Ten Ren and Chatime in Richmond Hill or North York. Plus - they're opening up a Chatime in Mississauga soon. Finally some real competition ;)  Not trying to be mean. Let's be real - have you seen the makeshift kitchen? Take a look and then tell me that fried chicken on rice is still good. The side veggies used to be cooked at the owner's kitchen and just re-heated.  Year ago, they didn't wash the glass cups with soap so I've always gotten a take out cup since. The large is the same amount but the small take out cup is a bit large than the in house small cup.*  They were pretty restrictive with their options. I was more than annoyed when I couldn't get a honey lemon green tea with aloe. Now that I can pay 50 cents extra for aloe, I won't go back haha!  I like Pudding black milk tea but I think they changed the cost structure to charge more because it's a \"premium\" drink that including a topping.  I get BBT is expensive now a days, but no one really needs to charge that much when they pay their employees cash, less than minimum wage and have more than a healthy mark up on their menu.  I can't wait to see the bubble tea competitive market change over the coming months!  Hope this helps - jT"}
{"text":"I like going here because they're open until midnight if ever I crave for some good boba or some Taiwanese chicken. I especially like the Caramel Pudding BMT but I get it with half sugar, too sweet for me. Also, I recommend trying their  or the shaved ice. The service is average, I wouldn't say quick because it gets busy almost all the time. The only downside is it's a cash only place."}
{"text":"I come here sometimes with a bunch of my friends after work. They have a huge selection of drinks to choose from as well as food. I tried their Mango chiller with green jelly and it was absolutely refreshing. This is the only place I have tried where the drinks aren't so watered-down or drowning in ice. One complaint I want to make is when the barista's try your drink before pouring it into the cup, they use that same spoon they licked, which is not very safe.  I decided to try their food. The reason why this review is down to 4 stars and not 5 is because of the food. I think the dishes lack salt. I tried their bamboo chicken with rice and it was very thick and tasteless. I don't know why but maybe it's because of the bamboo shoots? The rice was nice and fluffy though.  I say stick to the drinks if you wanna come here. There is a nice sushi restaurant next door if you wanna grab a bite, but they don't open late like Bubble Republic does."}
{"text":"Seems to be a decent place. I've only had the mango bubble tea so far and it was pretty good. The lineups for pickup here can be crazy though, and are especially unpleasant in the winter."}
{"text":"No line up at the time, waited 15 mins for 3 drinks!! Wanted to see what BR had to offer compared to other bubble tea place.  Very disappointed in the quality of the drinks.  Service was slow and decor felt cold and empty."}
{"text":"8pm on a Saturday, dine in for 4. This is my go-to bbt place. I've been here about 100+ times since my SO is a bbt fanatic. It's also convenient having a bbt place close to home. The front is always packed with people waiting for their take out orders late at night. So don't be fooled thinking you won't be served or have table to dine in. From the outside it did look packed, but as we entered there were a couple empty tables so we decided to stay.   I ordered Milk tea smash oatmeal chiller w/ mixed tapioca. All our drinks arrived one by one. Mine came last and it was missing the mixed tapioca I ordered. The problem was solved immediately by dumping mixed tapioca on top. Yet this wasn't my worst experience here. Half a year ago my partner and I decided to give the Hot smashed oatmeal drink and taro balls a try. It didn't go well since my partner and I got the stomach flu. Couple months later we decided to try it again and history repeated itself. Adventuring into the hot drinks ended but their chillers are still bomb! The good bomb!  My favourites: Milk tea smash oatmeal chiller w/ mixed tapioca  Taro chillier w/ mixed tapioca Oreo chiller w/ vanilla ice cream"}
{"text":"Back in high school, my friends and I used to visit BR almost every Friday night. It was our go-to place to hang out late at night despite having to wait 20 minutes, on average, for a table...every single time. (This was way before they opened their second location.)  These days, I drop by occasionally to pick up a Milk Tea Smash Oatmeal Chiller to go. It is one of their most popular items and I love it. You can even choose the percentage of sugar and the amount of ice you want in your drinks now -- makes me love it even more. This drink is loaded with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, cornflakes, and a drizzle of chocolate syrup.  Mmm... It can be really thick before the ice melts, but they always provide a spoon. I normally get it as is, but it tastes great with mixed tapioca, too.  The service is pretty quick when I order take-out, but I find it's quite slow when I dine in. They often cannot keep up with the number of people, especially when there is only two servers on the floor. We always have to wait a while for our receipt, and keep in mind, they only take cash."}
{"text":"Awful, slow customer service who always tend to ignore you. Always some kind of issues with orders coming out wrong or taking forever to actually come out. Really popular place for high schoolers, so always tend to be very loud, noisy and crowded. Price is decent and the variety of drinks/options is quite good."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill compared to a few years ago. The food taste horrible and burnt. They dared to serve customers a burnt piece of meat, only when i complained than they made a new one for me. I am positive they reuse their oil for at least a month, everything that they deep fried looks burnt.  I would not recommend anyone to eat here. I rather go to coco for bubble tea instead"}
{"text":"Not the fanciest or most updated sit-in interior, but decent pricing and great menu selection.  They offer crushed ice desserts which I usually end up ordering and not finishing so I have the remainder of my \"crushed ice\" (eventually melted) asked to be put into a cup to drink.   Would recommend the black milk tea with tapioca crushed ice."}
{"text":"Serivice is horrible as always. Came here again after about a year because I was in the area and was craving bubble tea. Knowing about the horrible wait times, I placed a phone order 20-25 mins before getting there. I clearly tried to avoid the long line ups but when I got there, I still had to wait. I don't understand why it takes so long to make one bubble tea especially when I ordered 25 mins beforehand. I ended up waiting for another 20 mins before getting my order. The reason people place take out orders beforehand is to avoid waiting when you get there. Nope. Guess that's not the case with bubble republic. It wasn't even that busy. Their bubble tea is okay, definitely not worth the wait. They should hire better waitresses and more bartenders."}
{"text":"I visit this place a lot with my girlfriend. Every time we go, we go because it is legit the only place in Mississauga that serves bubble tea. The bubble tea is meh, only because it's made too sweet. It's like drinking sugar. The service is a whole different story. It's absolutely horrible. The wait is always at least 15 minutes for no apparent reason. They have about 5 people making the bubble tea so there shouldn't be any excuse really.   Overall I would still get bubble tea from this place despite the bad service because like I said, in sauga there aren't many other places to choose from that are open late.   Definitely give this place a try! Just expect a longer than usual wait time and extra sweet bubble tea, (You can ask for lower levels of sugar, but I find that doesn't make a difference sometimes cause I feel like they don't care enough to give you a proper amount of sugar). Once you taste it, even the placebo effect can't help you. It still tastes like the same amount of sugar, 100% or 30%."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea is Mississauga! You guys got to try their renowned drink, \"CPU\". It is simply awesome!"}
{"text":"drinks are good, service is EXTREMELY SLOw......... Even on a non busy day !!! As much as I love their drink , i do not want wait to 15-20 mins for take out drinks."}
{"text":"I discovered this place since I moved to Mississauga area. Honestly, there are only very few bubble tea place in Mississauga compared to Markham & Scarborough. It's even more impossible if you want an authentic bubble tea!   SO one day, a friend took me to this place and I fell in love with it since then.   They are owned by taiwanese and they are known for making specialty flavoured bubble tea drinks. These specialty drinks cannot be found in common bubble tea chain, not easily found even in Markham. My favourites are their Black Magic (coffee jelly in milk tea), \"SPA\" (sesame, peanut and almond) and finally, they even have Pudding flavoured milk tea with pudding jelly inside!!   The place has about 20 tables ....can fit may 40-50 people I'm guessing. It gets really packed at night , attracts a lot of students from UTM since it is only 5 mins away. A lot of customers also just come in for take out, mainly because people in mississauga usually have access to car and they prefer to rest at home. The restaurant gets really loud when is about 70% full, because of their bubble tea shaking machine, slushee blender and customers' voices bouncing off the walls. They do have some taiwanese magazines..but not too updated.  hmmm...I'm craving for one now!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to have my bubble tea, even the tea my be pricey, but when ever i want to relax or have a drink with my friend, i would go there. 10 times better than those in the shopping mall."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and snacks on a Saturday evening.  Seemed like there was regular flow of customers for take out orders.  Toast dishes were generously sized portions of bread.  But the chocolate toast was more dense than fluffy, and it arrived with rainbow sprinkles on top, which somehow made it a little harder to stomach.  Noodle dishes were on the oily side.  Small tapioca bubbles for an extra 25 cents was a nice touch since many bubble tea places don't offer this option."}
{"text":"I went with some friends near the end of December.  It was less than half full, but it took them more than half an hour to make me a cup of simple black tea.  I requested for no sugar, no milk...not only did they put in sugar, but they put in so much that the drink tasted saccharine.  Food is overpriced, service lacking.  wOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE ."}
{"text":"This place takes way too long and staff just ignore you when you ask when your order is coming. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Over priced watered down bubble tea.  The tables also smell like socks - like they haven't washed the cloth for years and continued to wipe tables anyway.   Make sure you double check your order with them because they kept getting it wrong the last time we were here.  Keep coming back here every year with high hopes but just kept letting us down."}
{"text":"Since there isn't a lot of bubble tea cafe in Mississauga, this explains why it may be popular to those who live in this area.   However, compared to other bubble tea places such as Toronto, or Markham, or Richmond Hill, this place is not worth your money.  I've tried several items including popcorn chicken with rice, and their french toast.  I was dissappointed in their french toast. It was something I could made in 5mins and it was mediocre.  The popcorn chicken isn't that great. It was acceptable, but below average.  Their drinks are below average. A lot worse than most other bubble tea places"}
{"text":"Used to work at Square One Shopping Centre and one of my co-workers told me to try this place out because I am a bubble tea fan and have tried so many places. My favourite is a watermelon chiller with mixed tapioca! I love their choices & their prices. They get super busy so pre-ordering and going is probably the best option because you might end up waiting around for a good 30 minutes. Their location is good and they're fairly clean. Not all the staff speaks english well but they get the job done and are all super friendly! I also like that they accept vicinity points cards here."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend to catch up on life. We ordered the Oreo BT, watermelon BT and a plate of the fried chicken as apps. It was all good, until we found a hair tangled in with a piece of chicken batter. Not very appetizing to say the least. We brought it to our server;s attention and she replaced the plate with a fresh batch. Good enough, considering the horrible reviews their service has gotten. I thought we'd get a shrug and too bad. The service was good, polite and attentive. I'll be back, strictly for the BT."}
{"text":"Bubble tea here is just the beat. Try the specials!Also try the Carmel pudding milk teak and the Oreo milk tea"}
{"text":"My good friend raves about this place. So last night, we had planned to visit our friends that live in Mississauga and definitely made it a mission to try this place out.  I tried the TARO COCONUT BLACK MILK TEA with small tapioca and it was amazing!! the best BBT I've had in life and I can't wait to go back for more! Too bad we live in Markham!!"}
{"text":"Bubble tea is good the food is ok... But, never eat the food with vegetables because they just mix leftover vegetables.  Some of the staff is nice but some of the staff should just leave. One time I had food in a bag and didn't even open it. The manager came to me and said that if I opened the food now, I would be kicked out in a rude voice and kept on repeating it. It was on the chair next to me and I wasn't even paying attention to it! I wasn't even on planning to open it at all :S The next time I went, I was so pissed off I paid my BBT & dinner with coins. LOL  A year later, I came back my boyfriend and I paid with tip. A waitress ran out saying that we didn't give her enough. -_-\" We re-counted it and we gave her more than the bill. We gave her extra anyways JUST BECAUSE it was very cold and windy outside. The waitress must be really desperate for tip since she was willing to run out like that.  Today, I came to BR with my mom and brother because my mom wanted to eat here. Everyone went home and had to go Number 2 after eating their stuff (NO LIE). Is their food quality getting lower & lower or something? We all had the fried chicken on rice with obviously no veggies. Getting disappointed more and more every time I come.   Only coming back because of their BBT.  ON THE SIDE NOTE: IT IS A CASH ONLY PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"Small. Slow. And they love to remind you of their \"minimum charge\".    The last two times, they've gotten the order wrong and / or made an unsatisfactory bubble tea.  The chicken is rather greasy - but that's what you expect.  Most everything there is deep fried or MSG laced.  They don't exactly need any reviews - everyone who will go, already does go.    Their saving grace is in their take-out option and loyalty card - although they apparently think that if you want their specials, you cant' be loyal.    Also, for 3 years, they had tea eggs on their menu, but would never actually let me order one (always not available).    I didn't check which one this was - if it's the Credtiview one, its better for food (actual kitchen).  If it's the Hwy10 one, don't bother - they just nuke everything."}
{"text":"It's still a zoo in there especially on weekends but service is efficient and more than adequate. The bubble tea has improved so much that I think I will come here more often."}
{"text":"This Location hands down sucks. How they gonna do my boy K-grey like that?  What a let down."}
{"text":"Waiting time can be horribly long during busy. We waited 25 minutes for our drinks. Otherwise the taro chillers were good: creamy and not too sweet."}
{"text":"We were offered quick service and our bubble teas were delicious! The only reason it is not a 5 star rating is because the server could have been warmer."}
{"text":"I always bring guests to have bubble tea here. The tea tastes more authentic than the powered bubble teas that many stores have now. The tapioca is soft and chewy, the fruit juices taste fresh. Would have 5/5 review if the service was better, more staff during busy times."}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to drinking bubble tea (have only tried Coco, Chatime and a stall in Hong Kong) but this is my favourite spot for bubble tea! I love how their tapioca balls come in 2 sizes and the texture is much softer and easier to chew than other places. I think they also sweeten them a bit which is nice so you're not just chewing bland balls. I've only gotten the classic black milk bubble tea but they do that really well! Perfect sweetness in my opinion, no need to adjust the sugar or ice level. Will definitely be going back to try more drinks and their food. The supervisor I dealt with at the counter was really friendly! But the decor and furniture inside is a bit cheap looking. I don't think people who stay there to eat and drink really mind though. Excited for their new location opening on Bay, can't wait to show all my friends this Mississauga gem!"}
{"text":"This place serves pretty good bubble tea, but the service leaves much to be desired. I walked in today to place a takeout order. The server saw me, but completely ignored me while continuing to serve other customers. Okay, I understand she might have been busy.   However, what happened next made me really angry. Another customer walked in and the server immediately took her order, then ran off to the back to input it into the computer. Afterwards, she continued to serve dine-in customers. She did not come back to the lobby area for several minutes. Finally, when she approached I placed my order while letting her know I had been waiting awhile to place it.   She just said, \"Ok, yeah.\" No apology at all. I was beyond ticked off. I waited approximately 20 minutes to get my bubble tea, which is ridiculous. The quality of their bubble tea is quite good, but their customer service needs a lot of work. Most times I have been there the girls working there have been nice and courteous, but the one that was taking orders today was terrible."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea !!!!!!!! And yes its CASH only ... Why would you use debit or credit for  a $5 drink?  every weekend i come here, its really busy but shows how good the place is."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this place - Admittedly, I do like frequently this location because it's a convenient place to sit, hang out, and drink bubble tea. However, I am also very aware that it's a very mediocre place to get bubble tea. I'm definitely sure that others share my sentiment.   Here's the good stuff. It's open late, you can sit to your heart's content (minus the $3 sitting fee if you aren't purchasing anything), and you can have drinks and food. The staff are polite, and always repeat your order back to you in order to eliminate confusion.   On the other hand, their food is mediocre at best, but can be seen as a filling equivalent of fast food if you're really just in the mood to devour something. I find that their most popular dish is fried chicken/pork on rice, and I'm pretty content with their beef stew on rice. Their drinks are always decent, I've never had a complaint or any problems with what they are serving. It's is rather average, but where else can you grab bubble tea at 10pm in Mississauga? In terms of ambience, it does get noisy and busy in the evenings and on weekends so be wary of this (i.e. don't go there expecting a quiet cafe environment to have long, insightful conversations about the meaning of life with the love of your life).   Oh, and remember, cash only! That seems to catch someone every time."}
{"text":"The sesame paste noodle I ordered was bland and it did not taste good at all. The servers look like they hate their jobs and drinks take 20 mins to come. Will not come back"}
{"text":"Taste like coffee mate pure powder. No tea taste. It's like the cook dropped the whole can in there. Awful. Also, the minimum fee for sitting sucks. I wanted a bbtea and met a friend to discuss stuff and she was forced to buy a drink. Now I just go to chase mall for a superior product and it's cheaper."}
{"text":"I come to BR quite often and almost everytime I stick to my favourite \"Magik milk tea\". Your basic milk tea but a tad bit creamier/sweeter with coffee jelly and it's up to you whether you want tapioca added into it or not. I give it three stars because service could be better. I order take-out more than I sit-in, in hope of getting my drinks a little faster but that's not always the case. The longest I've had to wait for my single drink was approx. 20-25 minutes and I'm not over exxagerating. It was quite busy at the time, but 20-25 minutes for a single drink to take out is a little ridiculous. Many times where my friends and I wait to be seated when we do decide to sit in we wait by the \"please wait to be seated\" sign long enough to just seat ourselves because no one acknowledges the fact that we need a table, even when it's not so busy. Another star was lost when I started getting the \"peach green tea\" because I like a refreshing change. The first time I got it, it tasted great! Not too sweet, not too bitter; just right. The second time I got this drink, it was way too bitter, I had to ask for them to sweeten it up a tad bit. The girl I asked to help me rolled her eyes at me as soon as she turned around to bring my drink to the back to fix. I usually don't complain about my bubble teas to avoid reactions like the one I got, but it was completelt unecessary and rude. I thought third time would be a charm in hopes of the second time being a small con. It was disgustingly sweet, I couldn't finish my drink. Might be with just their tea drinks but maybe I'll just stick to my \"Magik milk tea\". I do still come back to this location because majority of the drinks I tried have been pretty good. I like that BR has many drink options to choose from, options that are different from other bubble tea joints especially in Mississauga (aside from Chatime).   Overall, service could be better. But the drinks are still good!  PS. I recommend you all try their simple but popular \"fried chicken on rice\"... Bomb diggity!"}
{"text":"I got a coffee chiller and they didn't fill it up and the drink cost me $6.50 with topoica. I told them to fill it up or I won't pay for it and the waitress was laughing at me :/. Im scare they might put something into my drink or what so I decided not to let them fill it up and just pay for it and left. The drink also lack sugar"}
{"text":"Excellent bubble tea, interest atmosphere and good overall customer service. The food is a bit below average but this restaurant has excellent bubble tea and a wide variety of options for bubble tea. I would put it on the top of my list for bubble tea. The restaurant can get quite busy but if you find a place for your group of friends it can be a great place to chat, play card games and sit back with a drink. Overall it is a great experiences here, the service has picked up quite a bit in the last year so if it has been a while since your last visit I recommend you give it another try."}
{"text":"Caramel milk pudding tea  with coffee jelly and small tapioca is my fave! I always get this when I come here :)"}
{"text":"I have come here twice and I have been disappointed. My second trip consisted of a very loud environment (can't have a decent conversation here), waitress not explaining/placing orders properly and getting attitude from the manager. I got the Oreo milk tea and I was so excited to try it. Once I got it, I realized it was a tube of ice in a cup. I did not realize how much ice there was until I dumped it out in front of me. I called the waitress over and she went to speak to the manager. She came back and told me that the manager will not give me another drink because I \"finished\" the one I already had. Really? You literally gave me a tub of ice with some tapioca at the bottom which I struggled to get out. The waitress went back to the manager and she was not concerned at all. The waitress gave her the receipt and she threw it out. She walks over to our table with so much attitude and asked me what my order was. I did not realize they were closing cause the whole place was full of people. The second drink came and I almost threw up. It was all powder probably \"blended\" in a dirty blender. Mind you, this drink was also full of ice. I knew I was not crazy cause I had all my friends try my drink and it was disgusting. Way to go Bubble Republic. You failed twice to make the same drink. Repulsive drinks and service. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I'm a local in Mississauga area. Don't get me wrong food is good in this place for casual eats. However, I'm giving this place only a 3-star because their customer service is the worse! I ordered almond milk tea three times from three different servers and it ended up not coming. We ordered radish on the side and instead of having 10 pcs. for order of 2 only 7 1/2 came!  On the other hand, the other branch in Creditview has the best customer service! Servers are friendly even though there's a line up. Food selection is the same but I would seriously rather come in Creditview even though I live behind this branch!"}
{"text":"AND THEY NOW HAVE LYCHEE, MANGO & small tapioca... (only took them few months)  large milk black tea with small tapioca = $5.25  DELICIOUS! just as I remembered it. If you aren't going to go animal crazy and finish it right away... ask them to put little ice cubes. They usually put in quite a few to keep it fresh but if you wait for too long, it gets watery. Nothing worst than a water bubble T. :(   p.s the membership card is pretty awesome to have. I now can redeem my points to get 2 free bubble T's. woot woot!   fun fact: they spell lychee funny. See picture.    xoxo M."}
{"text":"Way overhyped within the Mississauga crowd but decent. Food is authentic Taiwanese and their combos are quite good (especially their fried chicken).  Pricey, as is most bubble tea in the GTA, although it tastes pretty good and I love that they have small tapioca available. The red bean and pudding flavors are my favorites. Their honey green tea is also decent for those seeking authentic flavor.   I'd say this location is slightly better than the Huontario one in terms of ambiance and food quality."}
{"text":"This place is different from other Bubble tea places. They offer different size tapioca. I know... I didn't get it either until I tried it. My favorite items are the taiwanese fried chicken with rice and squid balls (non takoyaki but I like it better). They have lunch combos starting at noon. Comes up to around  $10-12 with tip. No regrets here. Definitely worth trying it."}
{"text":"the food was actually horrible. worst curry chicken ever. stick to the bubble tea as it's pretty good."}
{"text":"They have a newer location on Hurontario, which I wrote a review for. This is the original place where it was extremely packed and popular among high schoolers (including myself back in the day). Today it still remains popular having to wait a long time to get a seat. It's in a smaller, dimmer setting but the food here is much better than the Hurontario location (for example the brick toast, fried chicken on rice, as well as sesame paste noodles are my recommendations for what to eat).  The bubble tea is really something else - I like that it actually tastes like authentic Taiwanese milk tea and not just sugar and water, something other \"cheaper\" bubble tea places tend to go towards. It has a really complex and well-mixed taste to the tea - they really nail getting the perfect proportions to make an excellent drink. They also have a lot of specialty drinks that can't be found elsewhere.   I am biased towards my drink which is a classic: ORIGINAL MILK TEA + ALOE VERA (I like that they have a variety of jellies/tapioca) + LESS ICE (nice degree of customization).   Same negatives as other locatIon: really packed, might be a long wait to get a table (especially evenings), sometimes incompetent waitresses, really loud environment full of teenagers, and minimum $3.79 purchase to be there. If you can deal with all that, try this for yourself! Go to the Hurontario location if you prefer a slightly shorter line-up, brighter lighting, and more space."}
{"text":"A popular hot spot in Mississauga to get your fix of bubble tea. Luckily, the drinks here live up to the hype and popularity, something I don't like to admit. This is one of my guilty pleasures despite some of the negatives:  - having to deal with some young waitresses who often provide poor service - long wait times (especially for takeout bubble tea) - minimum charge of $3.79 or something ridiculous like that even if you are in a group and don't want to eat/drink - being surrounded in a loud environment full of high schoolers (sigh, I feel too old now..)  The good thing is there's a reason why the place is so damn popular among high schoolers: they really do a good job of their bubble teas. It has a really complex and well-mixed taste to the bubble tea, not just sugar and water - they really nail getting the perfect proportions to make an excellent drink. They also have a lot of specialty drinks that can't be found elsewhere. Even Tenren, which I consider to have some FINE teas, and Markham with a gazillion decent bubble tea places, this place holds its own west of the GTA.   Go to the Creditview location as it has MUCH better Taiwanese food. Appetizers are a bit expensive, and only order a combo if you're dying of hunger. If you must get a combo, get the fried chicken on rice at this location, and visit the other location if you plan to eat more.  My all-time favourite drink: ORIGINAL BLACK MILK TEA + ALOE VERA (healthier and natural sweetness over tapiocat) + LESS ICE (less diluted)  Side note: Yes you can ask for less ice and I like that they have a high degree of customization here."}
{"text":"They have AMAZING drinks and food that is to die for, but the service I would have to say is pretty bad..., the hostess made eye contact with me over 3 times but she still didn't ask me if I wanted to be seated... And I was in the dine in line..."}
{"text":"Worst service in the world. Ordered one bubble tea to go, waited 1 hour. The place is packed on a Thursday. There's one person working inside. She was swamped and looked confused !   Every customer was waiting for min 45 minutes and people were angry and she did nothing but run around like a headless chicken.   I recommend you going to a different location!! Don't waste one hour for a bubble tea and crappy service."}
{"text":"Ordered 1 paid cash waited 15 mins to check for my order girl said not yet; 10 mins later checked again both girls said no;  5 mins later I went up and told both girls I've been waiting and people who came after me are getting their orders;  they finally checked and they don't have my order.  No apologies and I asked for my money.  This took another 10 minutes as they don't know what to do ... I finally went to the back to asked if I'm getting my money.  Very poor service; no communication, no apologies.  Wasted 40 mins in this place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their mango black milk tea. However I find that their line up is relatively long and they take almost 30 minutes to prepare your drink. They need to hire more staff to cater to the amount of customers walking in. Their mango chiller is really good as well. I would recommend this place to those who want bubble tea but if you are looking for a quick service I would not come to this location."}
{"text":"Decent food and decent drinks for Mississauga. My usual order is the black diamond milk tea, which includes red bean, grass jelly and tapioca."}
{"text":"I swear this is the only place that has taro-coconut or taro-Oreo or taro mixed with any other flavour.....what? Soooooooo GOOOOOOD!  Whenever I ask for these flavours at other bubble tea places, they look me at like deer in headlights! I've been pretty obsessed with bubble tea lately and I love coming here for their taro/coconut black milk tea with tapioca and grass jelly! it never disappoints!   I always take it \"to go\" so haven't experienced their dine-in service yet. No matter how busy, they always try to go as quickly as possible to serve everyone. And never had any issues taking my order. They repeat the order back to you to make sure they got it correct.   As long as my go-to bubble tea flavour stays the same I'll continue coming here!!"}
{"text":"Take out system is disorganized. Wait seems to be more due to service than business.  Drinks: 4/5 Deals are ok. Drinks are standard. Service: 2/5 Disorganized and slow. Environment: 4/5 Modern and dim. Washrooms: 3/4 Meh. Worth it?: 3/5   Came here on a whim because we were in the neighborhood. Not knowing the Sauga area very well we turned to Yelp where the reviews seemed promising.   There were 3 people in front of us yet because of the layout of the take out order station part of our group was lined up out side. Not sure why they don't have us line up at the back of the place where the drinks are made and save having a server run all the drinks from the back to front constantly. It was annoying me how there was a runner who would run drinks 1 at a time to the front instead of waiting for a full order. So inefficient. They also bagged and tied every order of more than 1 drinks so we wasted a bag even tho we wanted to drink them right away. I should remeber to ask for no bag if I ever go back.   The drinks themselves we ok. Good (*wait) grab and go place. Don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bubble republic. During my time on Yelp I've read about Br countless times, so when I walked out of Chili Chicken House (next door) already full and saw I was outfront of Bubble Rep I decided to call upon the powers of my second stomach to push the 3 pounds of Chili Chicken already inside of me aside and make some space for a Bubble tea.  They have some of the most unique flavour combinations that I've ever seen in a bubble tea house. Standard green/black tea in a variety of flavours, as well as milk teas and chillers. Chillers really caught my attention, thick like a milkshake but with shaved ice and an oatmeal-rice like base for added thickness. They looked incredibly delicious but also incredibly filling.  I decided for my first rodeo I'd keep it basic and went with a Mango green tea juice tea with traditional tapioca balls. The juice was so refreshing that I found myself nearly chugging it. The tapioca had a good amount of chew but weren't too hard.  There were some reviews which referenced the service being rude or poor but I didn't find that at all. Even though I was being extremely indecisive they took their time to explain and wait for me to make up my mind. Very kind despite the rush.  Looking forward to warmer temperatures when I can return for a flavour filled chiller!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Got passion fruit flavored yogurt milk shake at 70% sugar. Still too sweet.  the place was only at 40% capacity but we still waited for over 20 mins. Oh yeah, they forgot a drink twice. Staff is friendly but definitely not good at remembering orders"}
{"text":"I go here very regularly but recently the prices increased for everything. It used to be a hangout place with people playing cards and stuff but now most people go to eat and have bbt and then they're give you your bill when you're halfway done so you'll have to leave. Service is not that great, once I even considered not tipping because the waitress got the order wrong and expected me to pay for it.   The tea is very strong. I like it. Some of the flavors are really good but some are kind of gross so don't try something unless you know what it is.   Personally, I like the Hokkiado Cheese Chiller which sounds nasty but it essentially tastes like blended cheesecake (in a good way obviously).   It's a cheap meal but prices are a bit high for bbt.  They also recently came out with something called a Green Diamond Chiller which my friend gets every time we get BR. It is Matcha Green Tea with red bean and a stick of strawberry wafer."}
{"text":"BR has always been a staple bubble tea and dessert spot for my friends and I every time we're in the Mississauga area. The food is decently priced, and usually somewhat filling. The bubble tea options are exquisite, as they offer a range of unique flavours like \"Hokkaido Cheese\", which is a must try if you have a knack for international flavour.   The only downfall is that the service has lacked as of recent months. The servers are very slow as the place gets full, but I assume that's not in their control. I waited for 30-mins for my food on multiple occasions but the servers were very polite about handling customer complaints."}
{"text":"According to my friends in Sauga; there isn't much choice for Bubble Tea there and Bubble Republic Tea House is the one to be at.  This place is always packed mostly high-school kids which I felt out of place.  The place is nicely lit so not an ideal place to bring a date (Go 4 tea is the place for that).  Bubble Republic is super loud and the chairs are plastic and uncomfortable.  The Bubble tea and food is average but I guess beggars can't be choosers in Mississauga for Bubble tea.  I guess I am just not used to it yet as I am from Richmond Hill/Markham where we have Bubble tea places in every corner.  Rating:  Service: 2/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Comfort 1/5 Decor  2/5 Value: 4/5 Parking: 4/5"}
{"text":"Regular hang out spot for friends although it can get crowded on weekends and nights.   The price's aren't unreasonable and are just how bubble tea is priced. The music is upbeat and (usually) Asian with the occasional anime theme song playing.   The wait staff is very nice if a little busy but they very good about accommodating you as quickly as they can. If you don't like crowds you can get your order to go.   Guaranteed there is something for everyone since they have a large drink menu. I haven't eaten anything there but my friends all like it and order something whenever we go.   I recommend the Cheese Chiller drinks-- theyre very good."}
{"text":"Ordered an oreo milk tea and it tasted amazing! Love the unique selection of drinks offered here and i've yet to find a place near me that offers the same. My friend also ordered the green diamond chiller and was pleasantly surprised with the biscuit roll and ice cream on top.  Food could use some improvement, the Taiwanese fried chicken and was a bit salty and had little taste. Same goes for the few veggies that came with it.  Prices are on par with Starbucks, but I'd say BR gets an extra thumbs up for the added touch of an oreo cookie/ice cream.   If you're looking to go in during the less busier hours on weekends 2-3pm would be ideal, the last time I went (around 6-7) the place was quite crowded and noisy. Service was good. Though their food isn't the greatest, they are now my go-to place for a good, filling drink in 'sauga. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I started out thinking, bubble tea in Mississauga is probably not stellar, all the best Asian food is already in Richmond Hill/Markham! This small shop was recommended to me by locals to Mississauga who occasionally venture to Downtown Toronto or Markham/Scarborough for food. This is a go-to gem for the family as their comfort bubble tea and simple noodles location - Taiwanese basics if you will. It turned out better than expected and there's a few items worth revisiting for whenever I'm in the area.  Throughout the day, tons of takeout orders are happening at the front desk, and tables are 25-50% occupied all the times I've been. I was quickly recommended by my party towards meal #1 - the popcorn chicken with noodles, with a SPA (sesame, peanut, almond) drink. Thoroughly impressed by both! The chicken is served on the side to retain their tasty Taiwanese style crispiness, and the noodles come loaded with flavour in the soup base. It may seem quite simple, which it is, but that's what it's all about! Always reliable, not too expensive, and your drink serves as both your drink and your dessert! The SPA was thoroughly enjoyed with tapioca - it's a bit gritty and thicker than I'm used to, but the flavour combo is great and the grit served to remind me it wasn't all just powder. Definitely recommended!  A later visit drew me to another menu gem - combo #18 popcorn chicken with \"fuyu\". This is a complicated one to explain and probably not a flavour for everyone. This is a fermented paste of sorts that's often served with braised lamb casseroles or vegetarian casseroles. It doesn't have too distinct a flavour on the chicken, but it does add a certain fragrance that gives the flavour depth. Same price as #1, it's my new go-to! We accidentally ordered rice instead of noodle and were greeted with a fried egg instead of a marinated medium-boiled egg, but it was still quite good.  What takes away that last star is that sometimes, the tapioca isn't quite fresh enough. It gets to that chewy state that doesn't seem to digest well, and that makes the drink tough work to chew. Some drink flavour are also a miss, like honeydew, but that is common among many other bubble tea places. The wait could be long if you're getting takeout drinks, so be patient!"}
{"text":"Terrible unorganized place. I use to come here every week. Unfortunately, times have changed and the last 8 times (yes I'm counting) 7 of the times they ran out of tapioca. 2 hours before closing. Absolutely ridiculous and the manager obviously doesn't know how to handle the inventory. I also just saw the waitress grab a piece of chicken off of someone's old plate then she wiped the grease off her fingers onto her pants and grabbed our drinks. Nice BR"}
{"text":"The Hurontario location is horrible when dining in. Took 45 minutes for my friend and I to get our bubble tea (which ended up being the wrong order) then it took another 15 minutes for them to give us the right one. I ordered the combo with rice (the rice was cold by the way and the egg was completely overcooked) and prior to ordering, I asked one employee if the $10.25 combo included any drink (she said yes excluding the coconut drink) so I asked for a small chiller. When asked for the bill, I was charged 3.25 (half the price of a small chiller) and asked why I was charged almost 16 dollars with taxes and she said a chiller wasn't free with the combo, it is half the regular price. I was upset because the employee did not inform me at all and when I talked to another staff, she told me it was in the menu (the font was so small that realistically people won't catch or read that). The least she could have done was inform me about it, and also, when they gave my friend and I the wrong order after waiting 45 minutes, they didn't even apologize at all. Overall, my experience with this location has been horrible, I always tried to give it another chance but same thing. Some staffs don't know how to service or remember the orders (even when they write it down). Just horrible."}
{"text":"Bubble Republic has a great variety of drinks and is slightly more authentic than other food-court bubble tea places such as Bubble Tease BUT not as good as TienRen (found at Square One, Yorkdale or Scarborough Town Center). A good thing about BR is that it is cafe style,and is a great place to hang out! Food is okay, some decent cheap eats!  However, it isn't the most authentic when it comes to the classic bubble tea: Black Tea, or any drink that uses TEA as a base because they use a tea bag, and lacks the sophistication of blending Ceylon and Orange Pekoe tea for Black Tea.   For Tea-Based Bubble Tea fans, I would recommend the Taiwanese run shop at The Chase, Mississauga. VERY authentic Black Tea Bubble Tea, and a very yummy Pudding Bubble Milk Tea!! :)"}
{"text":"Was ready to order but was ignored. Restaurant was near empty besides two other patrons. Saw the staff in the back glance at us then look away as if we weren't there. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Only 2 months ago, I started going here and it was LOVE AT FIRST SIP. And since our first visit, I've been here on average at least once a week. Bubble Republic has my friends and I hooked! They make one of the best if not the best bubble tea in the GTA!   After my frequent visits, I now have my order down packed - the chicken and rice or noodles combo with a small honey green tea with mixed tapioca and almond jelly. This filling and satisfying meal adds up to only $10, taxes and tip included! Yes, you heard me correctly the first time. For only $10, you'll get crispy boneless chicken goodness, your thirst quenched, top notch service plus taxes included.  Now you know why my friends and I pretty much live here. There's no other deal out there as good as Bubble Republic's."}
{"text":"NOTE: You can only use their points card towards take out bbt, even if you request a \"to-go\" cup to sit in, you won't get the stamp."}
{"text":"Pretty good place, but not exceptional either. At least I can report that the service was fine with me, which apparently has not been the case for other reviewers.  They get credit for having literally dozens of options for drinks. That said, I can only review based on the one I had. I was intrigued at seeing a drink with oatmeal in it, especially since I'm a texture guy. The description was poor though, but it was explained that it was essentially a chocolate milkshake with blended oatmeal.  I did end up enjoying the oatmeal aspect of the shake, but I was surprised that it had a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top that wasn't blended it. It was literally half the cup and the ice cream itself was fairly poor quality which really brought it down.  A bit of a mixed experience. I'd would try it again, but I'm not rushing back either."}
{"text":"Their bubble tea is always on point. I would recommend trying their Wasabi fries, and my go to order is always a delight.  Regular Order: Vanilla Ice Cream Milk Tea, No Sugar, extra Ice, Small Tapioca"}
{"text":"Always heard of this place but never thought I'd get to try it since there aren't currently any in Toronto. Found myself in Sauga over the weekend and couldn't resist giving it a try after having dinner.   I ordered the matcha slushie with grass jelly, red bean, and tapioca, topped with a chocolate wafer stick and a maraschino cherry. It was very yummy! The texture of the tapioca was just right, the drink wasn't too sweet, and it was overall very refreshing. Service was also great. Even though we just ordered drinks, a waitress kept checking up on us to see how we were doing.  Would definitely come back the next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"This bbt shop has been around for quite some time but I feel as a customer, the owner does not take pride in their business or try to make it as efficient as possible. The decor may have been strategically planned with uncomfortable seats and plastic tables so the turnover rates are quicker but the decor could use some renovation. I always call for pick up and when i arrive, it is never ready. The take out line is ridiculously long and the service are predicted to be slow. I use to look forward to drinking their caramel milk pudding tea but after so many bad experience, i gave up on them."}
{"text":"A favourite hang out spot for the West 905. Only thing opened late. Pathetic, I know.  Order the S.P.A, thank me later. I only come here for warm drinks. It is fun to hang out. It is loud. Bring cards, and chat with pals about non serious issues over light bubble tea."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give BR a higher rating, but the prices are ridiculous, the wait times are ridiculous and not to mention the service is subpar at best. Honestly there are two drinks that make me come back time after time - Milo chiller ($6.50, large with no toppings) and Taro Coconut Chiller ($7.00, large with no toppings). The two drinks are slush drinks and great for a hot day. The Milo Chiller is like chocolate milk in slush form - and has chocolate powder on top (I like mixing that into my drink right when I get it so you get little balls of chocolate powder explode in your mouth through your sips). The Taro Coconut Chiller is sweet and is the perfect balance of taro and coconut. I'm normally not a fan of coconut as I find it too overpowering, but this is consistently good at BR.  Recently, I tried their sit in meals. I ordered a fried spice chicken on rice with a fried egg and vegetables and made it into a combo. That cost me $11.25 before tax and tip. On top of that, the only drinks you get to order are the black milk tea series and anything else is half off the regular price. Certain items like the taro coconut chiller are still regular price and they're marked with two ** on their drink menu.  The meal itself was SUPER oily and my stomach felt queasy for the rest of the night. The chicken was like popcorn chicken and easy to eat and had some flavour, but wasn't amazing. Very mediocre."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's my go to bubble tea place whenever I'm in the Mississauga area. It's a very casual hangout spot with plenty of tables and chairs. Not only do they offer unique combinations of flavours such as Oreo Chiller or Strawberry Cheese Chiller. They also have amazing kitchen item menu which I think is pretty amazing for a bubble tea shop. A place that can do both is awesome. It satisfies everything. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout over the phone a couple more times since my last review and the drinks were ready by the time I got there, so five stars!"}
{"text":"After hearing warnings of how sweet they make it I decided to go straight up with something that really has no sweetness which was a chiller (you know, like a slushie) but of the genmaicha variety.   Typically I'm not big on matcha but add toasted rice and it's now a dessert.  Once in a while I will buy genmaicha from Davids to switch things up from my regular green tea that is my usual (Dragonwell).    Honestly I'm not used to green tea being served in steins.  Usually when I'm drinking out of steins it's instead beer and since I rarely have bubble tea or frequent bubble tea places it felt rather strange to not have that plastic cup with the top sealed where I had to insert a half inch diameter straw wide enough to vacuum up tapioca balls.  Not this time... this drink for lack of a better word was deceivingly thick considering it's a tea but hey it's also toasted rice too.    I really liked this drink but it's cold and gritty and it's like I'm eating a cereal that was ran through a blender... a completely strange texture!  It was sort of like sucking back liquid sand paper but it was surprisingly addictive.    The price difference between a large and small is only a buck (6 or 5) so naturally being the pro bulk purchaser I am I went with the large green grit and cool slushie looking thing that will scratch your throat on the way down but in a good way.  Since we just ate next door I wasn't really hungry but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted when looking at their menu of food just because of the pictures.  Photos of food are nice to look at kind of how it's not exactly burning your eyes to look at a Victoria's Secret catalog.  I thought it was sort of funny that some of the photos like of the fries had a photo of just ONE fry.  I also saw that they had chicken wings and even what looks like one of those pounded flat chicken breasts like what they have at Hot Star Large Fried Chicken except this thing was only 7 bucks as opposed to 10ish.  If I was to eat here I'd probably go for that popcorn looking chicken with rice and that egg on top.  Eggs on top are for the win.  It's not often I come to central Mississauga considering how close I live so bubble tea is sort of a treat for me.    Still, I'm not fancy on it or anything but it's interesting enough."}
{"text":"Went to BR on a weekday. They have a lunch box and bubble tea combo for around$11 which is not a bad deal. There wasn't too many people so service was fast. Bubble tea is good as always and with Wi-Fi always a good hangout place."}
{"text":"I'll be honest - this is my 2nd go to place.  When Chatime is crazy busy and/or they run out of tapioca (which happens quite often) I go to BR.   The reason BR isn't my first choice is because... 1. their bubble tea is WAY too sweet! Even when I request for 50% sugar or honey it is still too sweet.   and 2. every time I eat something here, I always end up with a stomach ache. Always!  So now I will only come here if I'm absolutely craving a bubble tea."}
{"text":"I dont understand why people hate this place so much. I've been going to bubble republic since i was 11, that was 8 years ago I even applied to work here before but I was too young and didnt have enough time.  Seriously this place is probably the best place to go for bubble tea in mississauga, its even better then Cha-Time and Bubble Tease.  Their bubble tea hasnt changed its amazing taste, they feature TWO SIZES of tapioca, which you wont get any other place.  Their Taiwanese chicken is probably the best ive ever had, always crispy and seasoned perfectly.   The only 2 things i dont like, is that they dont offer delivery and more locations, and even so i would walk after a long day at work to order their delicious bubble tea.  Their prices are pretty expensive for bubble tea, but good quality bubble tea is so worth it. I will continue to support them.  This little bubble tea shop is a gem to mississauga and remains unbeaten all these years and ive tried a lot of bubble tea in my years.    My recommendation: -Panna Cotta Bubble Tea -Caramel Pudding Bubble Tea -Smash Oatmeal Bubble Tea -Vanilla Ice Cream Bubble Tea"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  So I came here last night for the first time in months, and to my surprise it's been renovated! Crazy...  I've been coming here for years and I've finally decided to write a review on this place.   TBH the food is good but not great. Back in the day the food used to give me the worst stomach aches! And it wasn't only me it happened to, but to all my friends as well. The food has definitely improved in terms of quality, (no stomach aches yay!) but still not great.   As for the bubble tea...it's SUPER sweet. Even when I ask for 50% sugar, it's still super sweet. I always order the same thing - Mango Green Tea or Wintermelon with large tapioca and in comparison to their competitors like Chatime or CoCo, this is probably my least favourite bubble tea place.   The ONLY reason why I come here is because they serve food. If Chatime served food food I'd say deuces to this place forever."}
{"text":"Loud, loud, loud! How can anyone have a decent conversation at this place? The service is slow slow slow! We opted for our order to go once we arrived as the noise level was unbearable. The place is very casually run with furniture that is reminiscent of a high school. Their bubble tea is quite good. I ordered a taro milk tea with small and large tapioca pearls which was interesting as I chewed on them. If they could sound proof the place better I would definitely be back more frequently."}
{"text":"Im here to change my review.  I love how this place is not a hassle to get bbt anymore.  No line ups for an hour.  They have different bbt now to compete.  They moved their counter to the front for more efficiency. We even got a free sample today.  The food here is not something to pass up on either.  Fried pork with rice is amazing.  Renos made the place feel cleaner.  Would be nice to have more exotic drinks and even fresh fruit shakes.  Will be back again for food for sure.  Dont trust peoples low star reviews and try it out for yourself.  Dont just take my word for it.   Recommendations :  - Honey Aloe Grass Jelly w/ Additional Basil Seeds - Caramel Milk Pudding"}
{"text":"Great BBT and food especially for the price. One thing is they don't have avocado anything :( .  Their Taro Oreo BBT (w slush and tapioca and coconut jelly) was amazing. Def the go to BBT joint."}
{"text":"I love the food here, I really like the bubble tea. I will start this by saying my wife and go somewhere around 4 times a month.  I have to say though, this location is the most filthy location. The floors are black with grime, the ceiling tiles & diffusers are disgusting. If the front looks like this, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.   I will also add, that the servers are incredibly sloppy. They take forever.   I go to the location on Bay downtown Toronto where the service and speed is at least 5x better. They don't have the food selection like the bigger ones."}
{"text":"I would give this place less than one star.... Slow service, took almost 30 minutes for our orders and the place wasn't full. Drinks definitely looked good but the tastes were either very bland or horrible like the honey dew tea. Don't do it"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and it was busy and is noisy. Mount of the crowd was under 25. Kids having a good time with friends and a table they were playing cards.   Nice clean \"cafe\" (tea house) if I can call it. The waitress was so soft spoken that we could barely hear her and someone else had to come and help us out.   Ordered a green apple tea with medium medium tapioca balls,  a green diamond chiller with bean and a brick toast with strawberries ( was curious what the heck is a brick toast)  The green apple black tea with tapioca was good. Ordered with 50% sugar and it tasted less sweet for the teenager. Normal sweet would be great. The green apple flavour very subtle.   The green diamond chiller was ordered with 25% sugar and it did taste a bit bland. Suggest to up the sugar as well. But even with less sugar the taste was good and would have again. The crushed ice was a nice touch and bean a unique experience.   The toast was a thick piece of bread several inches thick with strawberry jam. The bread was toasted to perfection but the strawberry jam was a let down and too less for the size of toast. Sure with sweetened condensed milk would taste better.   Would go again and try new stuff. I wish the menu and restaurant catered to vegetarians."}
{"text":"I would have never discovered this place if it wasn't for my wife.  I go there strictly for the Caramel Pudding BBT. Trust me, it's the best. But ask for less sugar, it's really sweet.  It loses a star because it's one of the more expensive BBT places and the service is weak there."}
{"text":"Awful! A big bug/insect in chicken!!! We reported to the waitress. They said they will talk to manager. The worst thing is the manager came out and say they already throw the food and the food is no problem! WTH is that attitude??!!?? The manager ask me to find out the insect which he already throw in garbage can. OMG   And I'm feeling stomacha right now and going to the hospital. The worst restaurant I've ever been! Wait, should I call it resurant?"}
{"text":"Republic it is.  Whether it is socialist, communist or capitalist depends on the day.  Sometimes you are served within 5 minutes, sometimes it takes close to 15 minutes after ordering.    Here's what I like about this place:  -you get to set your ice and sugar levels and there is a plethora of pre-set drinks to choose from.   -The pre-set drinks are not too sweet (when I say \"pre-set\", I mean set recipe, not already prepared).   -overall, it tastes pretty good  Dislikes -service is really slow.  Don't understand waiting 15+ minutes for bubble tea. It makes me wonder how long actual food would take. :-S -the cash system is really strange.  You give the cash to the person at the right and then they take it back to the back of the store to get you change.  It seems strange.  Why not have the register at the front? Each time I give them money, I get nervous they'll get it mixed up or say I didn't pay. I also think I'm paying tax and not sure if it is going to the government, but that could be because I don't see the register. Once again, I am not sure, but possibly.   -cash only -not really their fault, but the clientele is so loud.    Verdict: If you have time, and cash on you, not a bad place to grab some bubble tea, but I'm not sure I have the patience to wait any more. :-("}

{"text":"I just came back from this place and how disappointing.  I use to come here back in the days and I brought my boyfriend who has never been to try out a hot spot. He ordered the chicken wings and as he ate one it was bloody. He thought it might be the breeding cause it has red yeast (whatever that is) he ate another piece and it was bloody too. He decided to check all of the chicken wings and noticed they were all bloody. We let our waitress know, and her reaction was: \"oh ok\" UHHHHH?!?!? OKAY?!? Just OKAY?!? First off, sorry you're all busy, but do your job and provide service to your guest. Acknowledge the situation and let the guest know that you'll look into it and take care of it instead of ... \"uh ok\"   Second of all, tell the cooks to deep fry FRESH chicken not frozen chicken, then breaded, then deep fried.. that's why the blood appears in the wings.   Third of all, do you guys care about health and safety?! Hmmm looks like it's a no. If my boyfriend got sick from those wings have fun with a lawsuit.   And lastly don't call it deep fried chicken wings or whatever it's called.. call it what it should be called - bloody wings.   Thank God I don't live in Mississauga anymore. Service is uh ok, establishment is messy and food is bloody."}
{"text":"One of the few places open on Labour Day. I was dying for for some bubble tea so a friend suggested this place. Lobby was packed with people for take out orders even though there were a number of tables available for dine in.   My friend suggested to get the special which was a Black Diamond Black Milk Tea with grass jelly, red beans and tapioca pearls for $4.19. Wanted to order their Sweet milk custard brick toast but the cashier warned us that it would take 10-15 minutes to prepare so I went with the Fried Spiced Chicken instead.   There was a bit of a wait time but not unusually long. The flavor and sweetness of the tea was fine (you can adjust the level of sweetness and amount of ice in your drink ) but it tasted very powdery like they used powdered coffee creamer. The tapioca pearls were soft with a nice chew, the way I like it. I was expecting the Fried Spiced Chicken to be spicy (hot) with a crispy  coating but they weren't. However, they were tender, juicy flavorful bite size morsels of chicken.  If I was in the area again I would come back to try more of their food. I would recommend getting their daily specials for drinks or their combos which includes a drink to get the most for your money."}
{"text":"I go to high school near here so BR is a typical hangout for student, rain or shine. The noise level is quite loud but it's not really the place for a romantic candle lit dinner so I don't really think that's a problem.   As a high school student however, I just wish that they opened earlier since there are two separate lunch periods at my school and it's not open during the first one so we have to go to the close by Bamboo Bubble place, which I really don't like. The quality and ambiance isn't the same.  They used to have cards that people can ask to play with for free but now you have to bring your own. Once my friends and I had a game of Scrabble there and the staff didn't blink an eye.   I usually get one of 3 drinks when I come here, depending on the weather.   Oatmeal smash milk tea (really yummy, especially with ice cream) Hot oreo black milk tea (great for cold days, it's really rich and delicious) Lemon green tea (pretty much like lemon ice tea with tapioca)  *I get them all with large tapioca, I'm not a fan of jelly.  I also usually get the special combo with sesame paste noodles - really yummy noodles with a marinated egg and cucumber and carrot shreds.   I've also gotten the beef stew noodles as well and I loved it. The portion was pretty large and the white radish was delicious.   Their menu is quite extensive for a bubble tea place - they have chicken wings and potato wedges, which is good if you're with a group of friends and you plan to stay for a while.  The sizes and prices are pretty good, and they have a really large menu at the door for people who are just getting take out. Considering the size of the place, not a lot of people stay. Personally, I like getting it to go but the casual atmosphere of dine in is relaxing.   I've never had any trouble with ingredients running out but I do wish the service was a tiny bit faster.   All in all, this place is awesome and you should definitely come here. Bring cash though."}
{"text":"Good drinks with daily promotion. Service is ok only. Love the honeydew milk tea. The shop is always busy though but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Their jasmine green milk tea is my favourite milk tea I've had. Believe me, I've had my fair share of bubble teas!   I usually add mixed tapioca, and half sugar because I find it too sweet for regular. One concern is their ice level. I always ask for less ice, and it seems they don't care and add almost half the cup with ice. They never seem to care about that, and I should be getting what I'm asking with a price that goes up to $7 per drink.   Other than that, can't wait to try their other items and to come here for lunch one time!"}
{"text":"Try to avoid going on weekend . Really under staff hence poor customer service . The day I went , can't even use the toilet cuz it's clogged . Was asked to wait to pay cuz their computer was down . Over all just not a great experience ."}
{"text":"This place has amazing bubble tea! The wait time for to-go orders is a bit ridiculous, you're better off just sitting down and eating there. By the time you finish eating, you're order will be ready.   My personal favorite is the Strawberry Chiller. It's the best strawberry flavored slush I've tried! My boyfriend gets the Mango chiller, but he prefers Chatime for his bubble teas and slushes.   We always order the fried spiced chicken on rice w/ egg (and no veggies!). Last time, they forgot to take off the veggies, and we asked to buy a new meal but they said they were sold out of chicken. RIP.   Can't wait to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Bubble republic has been my go-to sauga location boba spot for a very long time but I've noticed their service has changed for the worst. Drinks are still delicious but the service lately has forced me to try other spots. The wait time and staff friendliness at both Mississauga locations is what has driven me to not frequent Bubble Republic as often."}
{"text":"The drinks we order didn't taste bad. But i was really uncomfortable about my order. It was my first time visit, and i point the menu to the staff, that i want Large Assam milk tea ($4) and add coffee jelly ($0.5) to it. After I paid, i realized i paid 6 bucks for it... and went to the serving girl. She told me the \"combo\" i ordered automatically became a Magik milk tea on the menu, which is $6. ...... hmmm... trick"}
{"text":"Tonight, June/18/2017, I called and ordered some food for pick up -  a black tea crushed iced desert and pork cutlet over rice meal.   When I when to pick it up, a girl collected payment and gave me my order.  I brought home the order - I only live 5 min from the restaurant - and found my crushed iced desert all melted.   It was completely ruined and I had to throw it away.  The employee who packed the order did not have the sense and care to pack the cold iced desert and hot meal order separately.  It demonstrated an obvious lack of care for the customer.   What is ironic is that I gave this employee, a gal at the cash register, a tip, even though it was a pick up order.      What a disappointment!!!      Next time, I am going to drive a few blocks and go to Chatime or Sugar Marmalade.  BB J Lee"}
{"text":"Some of their bubble teas are very good and some lack flavor or its too sweet. Try the oreo milk black tea, taro chiller, oatmeal smash chiller etc because these are my favorite drinks there. The food there is only ok, but not the best since some of their dishes lack salt. Try the pork chop on rice because it is one of my favorite dishes... This place only take cash only if you guys are wondering."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to this place since 2012. Went last night with my husband. It was a bit of a long wait to order. As usual it was packed & very busy. There was only 1 girl working at the counter taking orders. It seemed the bubble tea place was short stuff cause I had to wait more than 20 minutes standing in line to get my order and not to mention the waitresses looked stressed and overwhelmed with a lot of people. Well the girl at the counter seemed rather busy counting changes (that's why my order took so long).  I can't say the same with the inside interior; requires an overall upgrade. The chairs had seen its better days and not to mention the menu holder was kinda taped together (lol)  Management seemed not interested in keeping the place upgraded."}
{"text":"(Actual rating: 3.5/5) *This review also applies to their alternate location on Creditview and Burnhamthorpe.  Disclaimer: I generally can't tell the difference between most bubble teas as long as the tapiocas are prepared correctly and the drink isn't powdery.  BR is one of Mississauga's top hangout spots for teenagers. You can expect the dine-in tables to be crowded throughout the day, and even more so at night. Even at 21, I find that I'm usually among the oldest there.   To maximize capacity, they pack their tables as close together as possible. Combined with the large crowds, this naturally results in a very loud atmosphere.   So why have I been such a frequent customer over the years?  1. Customization options Mississauga doesn't offer much choice when it comes to bubble tea houses. BR has over 20 flavours in black milk teas, black green teas, chillers, you name it. They also have an endless selection of tapioca and jellies.   2. Fried Chicken on Rice  This dish is a not-so-hidden gem on their short food menu. At only $6 or $8.25 in a combo, you get a generous portion of salted fried chicken on a bed of zucchini and bok choy, along with a fried egg on minced meat on rice. While the dish itself is not spectacular, it provides spectacular value for a quick lunch or dinner.   CASH ONLY!  Tip: I've found that they generally prioritize takeout customers over dine-in customers. Takeout orders are usually fulfilled in 5 minutes or less, while dine-in orders may take 10-15 minutes.   Tip #2: Be sure to check out their daily specials, where they offer a Large for the price of a Regular.  Tip #3: Ask for less ice, thank me later."}
{"text":"I was really craving some French toast so I got my boyfriend to drive me to BR. I got the pork cutlet on rice 4/5 there was minced meat sauce on top of the rice and three different veggie sides under the cutlet. My boyfriend got the fermented bamboo shoots with the side of egg (1/5) which he didn't like too much so he mooched off my plate. He got the pana cotta and I had the black diamond milk tea. And to finish off I have the brick toast with a side of toast (1/5) super disappointing! Keep in mind I only wanted BR because I wanted the toast. So my search continues on the hunt for good brick toast in the GTA"}
{"text":"Ordered the regular milk tea + a coconut milk tea.   I like my milk tea sweet. While most reviews for bubble tea places show people asking for half/no-sugar, I love the drink just how it is. Chatime, Coco, etc - the sweetness level without any adjustments to sugar is what I like.  Here, for the milk tea, the normal was not sweet enough. The tea taste was stronger than any other milk tea I've had, so the drink was more bitter than sweet. On the other hand, I tasted the coconut milk tea and it was extremely sugary. I honestly considered mixing the drinks so the sweetness level could be balanced.  They do not accept credit, only debit and cash.  There is no menu board. There's a menu pasted on the table at the cashier area, you order from that (I expect that slows the line down when they're busy).   Main pro is they are open late - until 1:30 on a Saturday as of June 2016 so 1.5 hours more than Chatime Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Been a customer since I was in high school (14 years ago) and to this date, there has been and probably always be a lineup of 20 people that goes out to the front door. Either business is blooming, or the ordering system needs a change for once. Ill give them the benefit of the doubt.   Every beverage is done perfectly each time. I will always be a returning customer that orders the daily special. Wish you would do something about people smoking by the front door."}
{"text":"Between finishing some errands and other planned activities, my girlfriend and I stopped at bubble republic on a Saturday afternoon.  Bubble republic is a good place for bubble tea.  They have two options, dine in or take out.  Since we had time, we went with the dine in option.  They have a fairly standard menu with lots of varieties of bubble tea (green tea, black tea, milk tea, specialty, etc) and there are also a number of options for food or Taiwanese snacks.  On this occasion, I ordered a strawberry black tea with jelly (regular ice and sugar) and my girlfriend ordered a honeydew melon bubble tea (no ice, 75% sugar).  We also added a side order of Taiwanese chicken wings.  The food and drinks came after a short wait and everything was good.  My strawberry bubble tea was sweet and strawberri-yi (it was slightly sweet. Note to self to order 75% sugar) and the chicken wings were yummy and greasy.  Service was prompt, but forgot to give us forks and extra napkins for the chicken wings.  Also worth noting that bubble republic does not take credit card.  Overall, a solid, positive experience.  I expect to visit again if I am in the area.  3.8 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Good bubble tea but extremely price.  Called to order 2 medium mango smoothie ahead, got there about 15min later and they were still not ready had to wait another 5min only to be told that they ran out of small tapioca.  Had to wait another 5min after that.  The restaurant was empty and just 2 other people were waiting for service.  Gonna have to look for a better bubble tea place with good/efficient service."}
{"text":"Bubble Republic is one of my favourite bubble tea places, even with all the bbt places that have opened up in Mississauga lately.  They have one of the best regular black milk teas and many variations on it/different toppings - Caramel Pudding, Honey Pudding, Magik (coffee jelly), Black Diamond (tapioca, red bean, grass jelly), ice cream, or panna cotta.  They also have one of the largest selections.  I especially like their almond or honey milk teas.  If you want to save money, they have specials each day of the week for a lower price."}
{"text":"Love the Oatmeal smash and Caramel Pudding.... However I don't want to talk about their service. Let's just say there's always some kind of issue or miscommunication."}
{"text":"Place smells weird sometimes. The service is ridiculously slow. The servers never speak English. They never take debit or credit. But the pork chive dumplings are good."}
{"text":"I have been here a lot over the years. This place is one of my favourite bbt places because of its location and the fact that it has Oreo and Oatmeal flavours available. Yum!   However, it definitely need to work on interior and customer service. For interior, it needs a fresh paint job, new furniture (wobbly tables) and an upgraded bathroom (ugly dark lighting). Also, they need more staff, at least for busy times in the evening. Please ensure they are properly trained too. I have recently noticed some employees either forget our order, deliver food to ppl who ordered after us, and even ignored us (standing still, not doing anything) when we were trying to flag someone down.    It's a popular place, but if it could upgrade a few things I would definitely give it 5 stars.  P.S. Bring cash! They cannot/will not split bills."}
{"text":"To say that I order from this place a lot says something. I am currently obsessed with their Mc milk tea..thus am giving this review 4 stars because I cannot find something like this elsewhere.  The only thing am still peeved about till this day how inconsistent their service is. Sometimes they take forever to bring your drink when you can clearly see it from a where your standing (note: this sometimes happen when it isn't busy too) or sometimes the service is extremely on point and your outta there. I mean, I dont know. Kinda playing with my heart a little.   Their food menu is surprisingly good. We have been back here for a couple of times because I like how plain and simple the food is. Their side veggies however, really taste weird sometimes.. almost taste like plastic-y if that makes sense.   Other than that, great location since its close to everything we could ever need.  I do recommend checking them out if your too bored with the other franchises. Lol"}
{"text":"Caramel Pudding Black Milk Tea is by far the best. Definitely recommended to try!"}
{"text":"I havent been here for a year or so. Few nights ago I decided to dine in with husband because I was crabing for their popcorn chicken. We ordered popcorn chicken on rice and minced pork on rice combo.   The minced pork on rice combo comes with one small drink. I ordered a small green milktea with no sugar and light ice. The drink tasted the same for many years it was pretty good. I was very happy with it.   The minced pork on rice was delicious. It came with one egg and the portion was average. My hubby finished the entire bowl and I was sure he enjoyed it.   My popcorn chicken on rice was disappointing. The popcorn chicken was lack of flavours. It was not salty enough. The rice came with three small side dishes. The portions were tiny for those sides. I forgot to take a picture of the sides they were underneath the popcorn chicken.   The three sides of the day was stir fry onions, stir fry celeries, and stir fry frozen green peas/ carrots- yuck! I wished they could put more efforts in the side dishes. If they wanna save the cost they could have just includes two sides with much better food/ingredients.    Overall experience was okay. Didnt expect much from BR anyways."}
{"text":"They have such cool bubble tea flavours and the presentation is great! My only issue was that the staff was very unfriendly.. They gave us attitude and it took us 30 minutes to get their attention so that we could order. They don't take MasterCard which is fine but just a reminder to bring cash or debit !"}
{"text":"We ordered the Aloe grass jelly honey juice which was not bad, and handcrafted pudding black milk tea that was my favorite. The brick toast was just too so so..."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to finally trying their Black Diamond Milk Tea after my brother raved about it. Unfortunately, I went today & was very disappointed in the overall experience.   The girl at the takeout/cash desk (named Shirley) was inefficient and simply could not manage what was required of her in this position. She spoke English to the customers but chinese to her fellow staff. When we ask her things, she's like a deer in headlights as if she doesn't understand either language. Took nearly 15min to have her take my order and at least another 20min to have a different waiter track down my bubble tea. Drinks were piling up at the takeout counter with nobody to pass them out to the customers. It was ridiculous!  Besides the poor customer service and horrible take out system, each bubble tea costs roughly $7.. let's just say, if you're going to charge that much it better be worth it.  When I finally got my bubble tea, the natural thing to do is gently flip the cup so the tapioca/grass jelly can be properly mixed.. that's when it splattered all over me because the seal wasn't even properly done.   Ok, fine.. maybe I shouldn't have moved the cup at all. But I could not believe how much tapioca I got in my drink.. I could count the number with my hands. I've never had bubble tea with this few tapioca pearls.  I live in the area but I don't believe I would come back, at least not for take out bubble tea on a Sunday.  I genuinely hope they improve and hire some more experienced staff."}
{"text":"My favorite bubble tea place. The bubble tea is the most authentic I've found so far; they use powdered milk, as it was done traditionally in Taiwan. The tapioca bubbles are squishy and perfectly tender; not too hard and not oozing apart. I've had more bubble teas here than I can count.   The food can be hit or miss. The vegetable sides that come with the combos can be amazing or boring, as they are randomly picked. Sometimes I get potato slices and these amazing marinated white carrot cubes, or I get corn and celery. The #2 is my favorite regardless, so I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to have sweet (non-alcoholic!) drinks and relax with friends. The service is rather slow (ordering, receiving drinks, paying the bill), but let's be realistic - if you're here, you're enjoying your sweet time in the company of others.  You would expect to pay about $4 to $7 for a single drink (including tax and tips), and I'd say that you'd chat for 1 to 2 hours. The place can get really busy and noisy; a full house is quite common on weekend nights.  Side note: Due to the current construction/renovation, the store literally has no sign. If you have never been to this shop before, then you will need to step inside to find out its name. You cannot spot it while driving or from the sidewalk. There isn't even a temporary makeshift sign. There is no sign at all. But the shop is still operating normally, so if you know about this location, just step in and order your drink."}
{"text":"Im a VERY big fan of bubble tease and when i get some...i always order the oreo black milk tea.  So where do i start? Well, of course this bubble tea joint is probably one of the famous or should i say the hype of the area in Mississauga.  Asians like me loves to hang out with these types of cafes. I usually come here sometimes with my brother and his gf when she comes over from London, Ontario or when my friends and i are REALLY craving for bubble tease.  We always get seated right away...well; we usually choose where we wanted to sit.  Ordering from the menu is always a quick service but i guess giving it to us is usually slow.  Their food is really good but the way they serve their rice in the meal...its a little too much; i guess you do have to ask not to put a lot in your plate.  The place is usually packed and is a little loud, you can over hear the music but it feels like a concert inside the cafe since you have your friends talking and then having the music put on blast as well too.  Price: Not too pricey for one person meal. I usually tip them at least 2 or 3 bucks for the whole service, despite the loud ambiance in the cafe.  I would come back to this location though for the oreo black milk tea ONLY."}
{"text":"Some people are addicted to coffee, I on the other hand am addicted to bubble tea. This place in particular fulfills my daily addiction. I'm addicted to you, I'm addicted to you, you're my addiction.  This is my newest and favourite hang out in Mississauga hands down. It's a very nice, modern, and relaxing enviroment. The moment you walk in you are greeted by the wonderful and beautiful waitresses. You can either get you're bbl tea to go or you can stay and enjoy the taste and sound of bbl tea. I say sound b/c all you hear in the background is either the hip-hop, R&B or asian music playing or the sound of blenders going making everyones bbl tea.   Everytime I go here I never know what to get and thats b/c there are pages upon pages of options for the types of bbl tea you can get. There are the speacialty bbl teas that you can only get at the shop, there's also the regular flavoured milk, black and green teas, you can also get the chillers(slushie), hot bbl tea, or you can even make you're own creation. To add more confusion you can add tapioca, beans, jelly or even ice cream to your bbl tea. If you're hungry theres food as well and when you get a bbl tea with you're food it comes out to be less than $10! What a sweet deal.  Now, just to let you know, NEVER get a large bbl tea b/c honestly it is the same size as the small. As for flavours, NEVER get longan or star fruit, absolutely the worst flavours you could get. When I ordered it the waitresses were like \"just to warn you that flavour in particular is very adventurous.\" I still went with it and ended up finishing it however I ordered another bbl tea to get the taste out of my mouth.  Lastly, this is the only place that has ever given me the option of whether I wanted ice water or hot water to drink. When I heard it I was like, HOT WATER PLEASE! I have never been given the option or have ever ordered it before so I took it and honestly I'm glad I did b/c after drinking one of the cold bbl teas the hot water just sooth my soul. :-D   Items to definetly get  -strawberry shortcake bbl tea  -chocolate chiller bbl tea -coconut chiller bbl tea -taro coconut chiller -hakkaido cheese chiller bbl tea -mocha chiller bbl tea -peppermint milk tea with vanila ice cream -black diamond black tea w/ tapioca, grass and almond jelly -smash chacolate milk tea  P.S let me know what you're favourite is or what combination you made and I'll give it a try."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting a Bubble Republic Tea House and my last time visiting this specific location. Let me start off by saying that my Oreo cookie milkshake type drink was absolutely amazing, no complaints at all with the actual product. HOWEVER, my complaint comes with the 25 minute wait for the 2 drinks. I more then understand a place being busy (not super busy either), but 25 minutes for a beverage is just unacceptable. This won't be my last beverage from this chain, but it will definitely be my only drink from this location."}
{"text":"I managed to stumble across this Bubble Republic Tea House location yesterday while in search of a chocolatey beverage. This place is located right inside of a plaza and has plenty of parking. Upon entering I realized the place also had a pretty good food selection (Sadly, I ate only an hour before coming here) to go along with the large bubble tea and beverage selection. I generally go to places like this to get frozen drinks since I don't really drink Tea. I ended up ordering a Chocolate Chiller drink which basically tasted like a glorified milkshake. My one and only complaint about this place was that they don't take credit which is only an issue if you are using an American card since it doesn't allow debit, but luckily there was a TD Bank a few buildings over. Overall, I would definitely come back to this place, especially to try some of the food!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I used to hate bubble tea or milk tea or any of those drinks but when I tried their Black Diamond Black Milk Tea I fell in love with it! It is so good. The best I've ever had! If you are unsure of what flavour to get, try this one!"}
{"text":"Bubble Republic a fallen dynasty.  We used to go to bubble Republic every week.  We couldn't get enough of it, I believe this is how the rest of the West enders felt.  BR must have known about this so food portion went down and prices went up.  Yet we all stayed loyal, I finally have enough after ordering 3 drinks a large coconut bbt (flavor tastes super sour), large black milk tea (about 1.5 cm under the top) and a large caramel pudding (good) all came up to 21 and change.  Will I ever go back, never unless I want to humor myself with expensive low grade bbt.  This is definitely not a good customer focused teashop"}
{"text":"My first experience with bubble tea was approximately 8 years ago. And it was at Bubble Republic (BR). I think. You know what, now I can't be sure, but it was somewhere in the GTA. I think. Bubble Tea quickly became a favorite drink of mine. Shortly thereafter, I was introduced to Thai iced tea. Then I learned about Thai food, Bánh mì, Hakka food, etc. Then I got fat.  I don't know if BR's prices are what you can expect at an average bubble tea place in GTA, but I think it's a tad on the pricy side ($5.00+). But then, almost everything in GTA is a tad on a pricy side for a non-East coast American like me. However, BR has daily specials, which are slightly cheaper ($3.00+).  I don't think I've ever had anything bad from here, but for the uninitiated some of the generic Canadianized drinks would be a safe bet, I'm sure (Oreo, Caramel, etc.) It ends up tasting milkshake-ish. Every drink I've had has been well flavored, well blended, and pretty satisfying. They're not stingy with the pearls; a good third of the drink will be just that. Also, the drinks are never, ever watery (which seems to be the main issue that I've had with other bubble tea places).  Every time I've been to this location, it's been really quiet and not remotely busy. Service is decent, but it's nothing memorable. On an unrelated note, I've noticed that when you first walk in, there's a sign that says that you should wait to be seated or something. That's standard I guess, but I find it really odd that customers will come in for their to-go drinks, stand by the front door and not move; even if the entire place is completely empty and all of the empty chairs are beckoning. They're like really well-trained dogs or something, because they won't pass the small space by the front door while they wait for their drinks (which can sometimes be quite a long wait). All because of a piece of paper that says they should wait to be seated. So well behaved, you Canadians. It's cute; following the rules and whatnot."}
{"text":"Took the fried chicken and the fried pork with rice and noddle combo. Was a good price for that portion. Vegetables included but not much tasty.  Only the meat was really tasty. You get the small bubble tea for free. I find that the small drink in bubble tea is lesser in quantity than the take out one."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their selection is great and weekly specials are key if you're down for some nice $4.19 bbt. Also great way to try a bit of everything. I personally get the Jasmine Green Milk tea each time with half sugar and mixed tapioca and it's just amazing. The mixed tapioca makes such a difference - I'd strong recommend it as an alternative to the regular tapioca.   Either of the locations are always pretty busy so be sure to call ahead and order beforehand if you want to avoid the line."}
{"text":"First time venturing into Mississauga.  My friend and I were attempting to find a place to hang out at on a Monday night (apparently there isn't many in Mississauga).  The place closes here around 12 AM, so that wasn't bad at all.  The decor was quite shabby - but I might be comparing it to the nicer places located in Markham/Richmond Hill.  The service was pretttyyy slow.  Took them forever to get us a seat.  Took them forever to get our order.  I ordered myself a taro+coconut hot milk tea with small tapioca.  It was a little too sweet for my liking.  My friend ordered himself a pineapple chiller. Didn't get a chance to try it out though.  Considering that it's one of the few bubble tea places in the area - I can't complain, but I've definitely had better in other the GTA."}
{"text":"BEEEEEEEEEEP! RUDE! Take this as a warning.   My friend wanted to grab some bubble tea before dinner, so we walked in. We weren't even a step in when this Asian greeter blocked us near the door. No \"Hi, Herro or Welcome\" ... straight to \"Sit in or take out?\"   I mumbled, \"Take out please.\"  She swiftly took out a pad and held it close to my face, \"What you want?\"   I felt like I was watching a bad chinese movie. My friend ordered. The girl didn't invite us to come in and sit during our wait. She moved past us to the counter at the very end and relayed our order to the guy behind the counter. Then, she came back with the bubble tea and thrusted it in my friend's hand, with a non-smiling \"OK, BAAAAAAI.\"  I don't care about how good the bubble tea is. Or the fact that this place is open late. If you don't know your \"Ps and Qs\" you're not getting my business."}
{"text":"Like the other bubble tea places around in the area, it is not as unique anymore since there are a lot of competitions. Price is just as expensive anywhere else but the environment is that it is always very loud. I often times have trouble hearing my friend even if I am beside them which is an issue because then I appear to have a hearing problem (I don't think I I do!).  I usually get their black milk teas original to be safe, but I think their aloe honey green tea is not bad if you want to try something different from the milk teas to offer from. Taro chillers are still my fave here when I go, just on the pricier end. They give a cherry on top if you don't ask it to be in a takeout cup."}
{"text":"Love coming to Bubble Republic for a quick lunch on a workday and also hanging out with friends.   Bubble Republic is a great bubble tea shop at Mississauga with another location on the Square One side. They offer bubble tea for take out and also sit down dining. Their lunch and dinner special has a combo option where it allows you to add a drink to the meal at a discount. From my experience, I like their regular milk tea and pinna cotta milk team. For food, the popcorn chicken on rice, deep fried pork chop on rice (large portion), deep fried chicken pork chop on rice (large portion) are some of my favorites. There are also some snack options available such as rice noodles, sausages, and fish cakes.  The restaurant isn't very large, but the tables can be move around to piece together for larger groups, though I'd recommend coming in a group of 4."}
{"text":"Typical Order: Caramel Pudding (yum)   Pros:  - huge variety of milk- and fruit-based drinks (they also have some pretty weird ones too... oatmeal smash for example)  - close to the Chinese restaurant/shop community - quick & friendly service  - daily specials  - this location is def. not as noisy as the newer location - cute decor/ambiance   Cons:  - BR locations are only in Mississauga!   I've been coming here for years & I've seen the wait staff turn over with time. It's a really awesome place to hang out with friends, catch up, play cards, etc. It isn't a very quiet spot so I wouldn't recommend studying here (hehe). It's a small community so if your friends are bubble tea loving friends (and live in the nearby area), chances are pretty high that you might bump into them.   Check it out. :)"}
{"text":"Lots of variety in terms of drinks and food!   Pros: - Options: The amount of toppings you can get with your drinks is great (I believe that there are at least 10 options.  - Drinks: The milk teas are pretty decent. I really liked the Handcrafted Panna Cotta Milk Tea. It is different then other drinks that I've had.   Cons: - Service: I was really disappointed with the service I got. When I asked the server what she recommends, she just pointed me to the menu. She looked very unhappy and was not very pleasant. She also did not tell me that there was an uncharge to mixing toppings, although she recommended me to mix it. I wouldn't have minded to pay it, but I felt like she should have told me that there was an additional fee.  - Noise level: The first time I came here, it was so noisy. I felt like I had to shout to my friends sitting across from me in order to speak with them.   Drinks I like: - Handcrafted Panna Cotta Milk Tea  - Strawberry Cheese Chiller    Overall, I do not think I will be coming back for a sit in. The service my friends I got was not very nice. If I am in the area, I will be taking out."}

When i came here on a sunday afternoon it was not busy therefore didnt have to wait too long to get it. The service was quick enough to make my friends and I feel like VIP for a moment. I think i prefer this location rather then the Bubble Republic on Eglinton. My Taro milk bubble tea tasted better then most times at any BBT joint."}
{"text":"\"Meh, i've experienced better\" sums it all up.  Came here to order a mango bubble tea, with tapioca and jelly. Way too expensive for mediocre bubble tea, iv had wayyyy better for half the price I paid. If I recall, I paid around 7 bucks plus tax.   The lines aren't even that big, But they make you wait like 10 million years before u can order, then you actually have to wait another 5 million years to get your order, god forbid I wanted to eat in. *sighss*   I wouldn't come here again unless if I was really desperate"}
{"text":"Been here a 100 times. Not even exaggerating. Place is really meant for drinks. Bbt is great, tapioca is on and off. I always get their slushies (I love cold drinks). Their food is okay. Decent for a bbt place. Typically everything is fried and u can get either rice or noodles in soup as a main dish and a bunch of apps. Overall is great."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea I have ever had . Wayyyy too many options . I prefer the tea based ones with tapioca or jelly.   Normally there is quite a wait. Great for take out."}
{"text":"Waits are long for take out but their bbt is pretty damn good. They don't skimp on the flavouring unlike many other places. I like that they have the baby tapioca. They don't have fresh fruit (which I don't get, but my hubs prefers it.)"}
{"text":"My last visit to Bubble Republic was almost 10 years ago (the old location at creditview). It was cool going there back in the days with sweet and artificial bubble tea. The past few years, I almost forgot Bubble Republic exist since many different large bubble tea chain stores opened around the area. Today I finally have a visit to this new branch, and for sure they have changed a lot. A lot better, but it was hard to find the location because of the construction going on outside with super dark surrounded area.   I have to say, they have a large selection of different flavors of hot to cold drinks. I had their hot barley milk tea, and I think it was not bad at all. It was great that they asked each customer for the sugar level of each drink."}
{"text":"I tried their drink with my friend last week. I love the drink but I forgot what was it called. Hopefully they can finish up creating their website so i can the menu."}
{"text":"Now that there's Chatime I rarely go to BR now. However, I was in the area so I decided to get some bubble tea. I was gladly surprised when I entered because they have changed the entire takeout system. Now you can order and pay at the front. No more waiting for the waitresses to go back and forth to put in your order and get your change."}
{"text":"I've been here many times but for some reason I haven't written a review for this place yet. I actually give Bubble Republic a 3.5/5 because their bubble teas are pretty good but their service sucks most of the time.  The speed of service here varies throughout my many visits. Some days can be pretty  fast and some days can take FOREVER. For today's case, it was an average speed. There were several customers placing take-out orders when me and my friend arrived today in the afternoon. However, we were greeted and had our orders placed immediately.  The main thing that slows down their service is how they take your money by the front desk but will have to go to the back of the store to get your change. Also, they don't have the plastic points card anymore and have reverted back to their stamp cards.  What I usually order when I come to Bubble Republic is their smash oatmeal chiller with large tapioca. It comes with ice cream topped off with corn flakes and chocolate syrup, soooo good. You should try it out!  This place is great for hanging out with friends during the evenings and can get pretty loud because of the blenders going off and everyone talking in their own language. If you aren't a fan of fobs, this is not the place for you. I can't tolerate them either but it's not bad if you come with friends."}
{"text":"Good bubble tea for the price. The oreo black milk tea is my go to drink every visit. The wait times are the biggest concern. Even if you decide to call ahead you will still wait for a considerable time for your drink. Only cash and debit."}
{"text":"The bubble tea here is good and they have a wide selection of flavours to choose from. However, the service here is terrible. Got take out and asked for 'no ice' in my drink yet the drink came out after a 15 minute wait with ice. Didn't want to wait another 15 minutes so took it and left. Also only takes debit or cash yet when I tried to pay with MasterCard the girl at the front didn't even try to stop me which caused more delays in the end. Will come back to try the food because it looks good and hopefully the service will be better."}
{"text":"My favourite boba is caramel black milk tea pudding. I ask for it half sweet as it comes with caramel pudding jelly.  If you're dining in, my favourite snack is wasbai French fries sooo good."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here since they first opened. They are the bubble tea pioneers of the west GTA. My tastes for boba have developed with their menu.   My go-to these days are any of their black milk teas; they are creamy and refreshing. I prefer their drinks half-sweet so I can get the flavor of the tea. Get the panna cotta (milk pudding) or the honey pudding if you're looking to get out of the tapioca stream. If you like red bean, the black diamond is a filling drink!  Their food has changed over the years. I still don't prefer the noodles. Their pork chops and chicken dishes still reign; my hit list includes the Taiwanese red sauce pork chop, pork belly (for a serious cheat day) and the chicken filet on some days (sometimes it isn't that crispy).   Music and blenders are often too loud. Unless you have a loud group, you might not have a chance to really mingle, even two feet away from each other. Get a seat by the door if you can.   You know you're from Mississauga when BR is no longer Baskin Robbins or Banana Republic. Cheers."}
{"text":"Drinks are good. Service is pretty slow and the place is small but often packed. Cash only. Once you get your drink though, it's a great treat. Walking distance from my rental so I do go a few times a week."}
{"text":"Food was really good, I've never had Taiwanese before and I won't tastebuds we're very satisfied. Portions were good, the bubble tea I wasn't a fan of as it tasted kind of watered down. The chicken and sausage was really good. The environment was really cool, wish we had a place like that in Brampton. Really cool place to relax, eat, chill and enjoy some decent bubble tea. I'd  recommend this spot as the environment and food was really dope, ill definitely be back"}
{"text":"Placed a takeout order via phone.  Expected to be able to pick up the drink and go, because it usually takes me 20-30mins to get there.  However, my drink was not ready upon arrival.  10 minutes later my bubble tea was still not ready.  Why would it take more than 40 minutes to make a drink??  The waitress did not explain nor apologize why it took so long, only telling me that she had already asked them to make it. After I had paid for my drink I saw her ask for it to be made.  So what was the point of placing the order ahead of time then???  I asked for my money back and left."}
{"text":"One of the first bubble tea joints in Mississauga. Also the most expensive one. The service here is mediocre and the wait is pretty long.   The only times I went goto BR over the other place would be to get their signature Taro Coconut chiller or Milo Coconut chiller. Otherwise there are plenty of other places in Mississauga to head to bubble tea for."}
{"text":"This place is getting worse and worse everytime I go. The bubble tea is always powdery and I'm getting major stomach pains every time I eat their food. Not just me...we all do. Like do they not cook their meat? Or do they used expired meats? i'm tired of it."}
{"text":"I've been to BR more times than I can count and I've tried just about every drink on the menu. I personally prefer this bubble tea spot better than others like Chatime and Green Grotto because BR's flavours are more concentrated and they don't taste powdery or watered down.   Over the years, the place has improved a lot. Originally they only accepted cash but now you can use a debit card. Originally their washrooms were also absolutely disgusting but they renovated it and the last time I went, the washrooms actually looked better than the restaurant itself. It had mouthwash, Q-tips, hand cream, sanitizer, and just about everything you'd need.    Order-wise, I typically get a chiller--either the Taro, Honeydew, or Smashed Oatmeal. Definitely go for their daily specials because it's a good deal and the flavours are pretty good. In terms of the food, I always get the minced meat on rice--it tastes amazing topped off with the vegetables.   But of course, my experiences with BR haven't always been good. Once, we tried the hot smashed oatmeal drink and got the stomach flu. A few months later, we went back and got the same drink to test if it was actually due to the drink. Sure enough, we both had food poisoning. EVEN WITH THOSE BAD EXPERIENCES... I still go back to BR all the time for its chillers because they're actually a lot better than its competitors."}
{"text":"I was visiting Canada and we met up with a friend here, the place is very busy, we got seated while we were waiting for our friend, she shows up like 10 mins later we are ready to order..  10-15 mins go by nobody takes our order... some of the girls even avoid eye contact I was like. Wtf!  Finally I waved a girl down to take our order, we get our drinks quite honestly nothing special... we finish our drinks and asked for the bill... 15 mins later no bill.... my friend end up walking to the front desk and she was told \"you should have asked again, we sometimes forget\"  u must be kidding me....... we should have just forgot to pay LMAO  Oh yeah CASH ONLY...."}
{"text":"I would give this place 6 stars if I could. Best bubble tea ever. There are so many bubble places but nothing compares. The only problem is they need more servers as this place gets very busy sometimes.   Suggestions to order:  - coffee chiller  - Chinese sausage  - mango chiller  - popcorn chicken on rice   Be prepared for a wait and being with many aSiAnS ^_^"}
{"text":"Of all of the bubble tea joints that are in Mississauga, BR is my favourite! I have been going to BR since the start of the the bubble tea business at the Crediview branch many many years ago. I rarely come to this location even though it is A LOT of bigger, brighter and quieter, simply because it is harder for me to get to. It is situated in a relatively huge plaza at Hurontario/Eglinton where the Asian grocery store Ocean's is located. I met up with a friend on a Friday evening at 6:30pm for a quick bite. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a waitress. The waitresses were all very nice. They took my orders promptly and didn't mind getting things for me (eg. extra knives and forks, ketchup, water).   They currently have a Christmas special where there is a special item (discount on certain things) each day. I ordered the hot cinnamon black milk tea and it was delicious even when I asked them to not put any sugar in it. I also got the wasabi flavoured potato wedges. It is flavoured, so there wasn't any wasabi aftereffect. I am glad I got this because I was debating between that or the yam balls with condensed milk and the waitress who served us immediately told me to get the potato wedges in a heart beat because she liked them more. Extra points for being helpful and not say \"they are both good\" like other restaurants. The food came out in no time too!   I think I will visit this location more now. It is quieter and more spacious. It does get crowded as the night goes on so visit in the afternoon or early evening. There were also a lot of takeout orders during the 2 hours I was there, but the people making the drinks were quick! I am impressed by the service of this location....perhaps even better than the Creditview location."}
{"text":"caramel pudding black milk tea, tapioca, no sugar mmmm. sucks that they raised their prices but still the best bubble tea in sauga!"}
{"text":"Worst meal ever. Do not order the tan tsai noodles. It was 70% beansprouts with five 1cm cubes of pork. The soup was tasteless and gross. For almost $10 with a drink this meal was so disappointing. The Taiwanese chicken meal wasn't any better. Such small portions with strange veggies on the side. The jasmine green milk tea was so thick. Way too much milk. Better bet is to drive to Markham and try Zen Q or Cha Me Cha, where the portion size, quality and taste are much better."}
{"text":"Was my go to bubble tea place in mississauga but I feel like the quality has gone down. The food and drinks here is really disappointing when I get take out. They either mess up my order or give me burnt food. It went downhill since Chatime showed up.   If you try calling to place an order after 11pm. Save your time. They turn off their phones.   Dine in is still okay but service is not that great."}
{"text":"This bubble tea shop offers a huge variety of drinks, cold and hot. It has been a nice place to chill and hang out with friends. However over the years all you can see is that the quality and service has gone down extremely due to the increasing competitors around the area.   I've been here so many times over the years and there is always new staff.  The turn over rate of this store is extremely high and the works seem to not know the menu. The service is really slow which means there is always a really long wait. They seem like they are lacking staff.   This location of bubble republic is so far the worst one. Even though they are extremely busy all the time. The drinks always end up wrong or the flavour is off. Additionally, the place is dirty and is not as clean as it is supposed to be. Sometimes the drinks cups end up being sticky and the tables are not properly cleaned. Other times you get utensils that are not properly washed and have food stuck to it.   I feel like it's better going elsewhere as the drinks and food don't seem too sanitary..."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of friends on a Friday night. The place was pretty lively, but the service SUCKED. It literally took us ten minutes to grab the attention of our server. The waitresses kept chatting in Chinese and ignoring the customers.  The bubble teas are okay at best, they screwed up some of our orders and some came out really watery. Was not the best experience for bubble tea. At all.  Won't come back for sure. I guess I'll be going back to Bubbletease in Square One."}
{"text":"The bubble tea is eh, it's been a hit and miss for me. I've tried many random drinks here and to be honest, some of the drinks are just bad. Most of the chillers are a safe choice though. The Caramel Pudding is pretty good, and another interesting one is the Mango Colada.  Service is also hit and miss... I used to go almost weekly, and noticed takeout is either 5 minutes OR 20 minutes. Howeverrr, the last time I went they made me wait almost an hour. This was when it wasn't that busy, and I called in 10 minutes ahead. They didn't start making the drinks until I reminded them 20 minutes in, and even then it took ridiculously long. Coincidentally, the last time I tried to dine-in, we stood in the Seating line for maybe 20 minutes. They claimed they didn't know we wanted to be seated, but we were IN LINE facing away from the takeout counter lol... After we got seated, it took us another 20 minutes to get our fries and drinks so...  The food was not bad. I personally love the sweet potato fries, but everything else is just alright. I only recommend eating here if you just want to chill with some friends.  I probably won't be coming here again, it was good while it lasted but... Service has been going downhill in my experience, and the drinks are crazy expensive. I'd suggest coming here at a time when it's not busy, you'll get a MUCH better experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time since I was in the area after getting off my flight at Pearson.  I expected much more because of all the hype from my friends that love this place.  My first impression walking in was... \"cheap\". The furniture and the decor.  Not to mention the mall was under renovations so from the outside it looked like it wasn't open, but that's the mall's problem.  Service is OK, except I found it gross when I saw the waitress spilled a drink... She wiped the counter, her apron, and the floor...all using the SAME towel to wipe a drink she's about to serve to a takeout customer.  We waited about 10 minutes for the first drink to roll out, and another 10 minutes for the food to start serving.  Food was average, dumplings all had holes in them so nonetheless all the juice was spilling out, and I was disappointed that it was served with soya sauce. We asked for vinegar, but they only had \"white vinegar\" available as an alternative.  Popcorn chicken is their known dish, it was well made.  The milk green tea that I ordered tasted exactly the same as Destiny's.  The peach green tea my brother ordered was overly sweetened, almost like drinking sugar.    Coming here once was enough, probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Have only been here for their bubble teas and I'm not going to lie I stick with the tried and true Mango Chiller. I make sure to ask them to not put any dairy in mine as I am lactose intolerant and lots of tapioca because who doesn't like tapioca. My friend have tried their other flavours like the coconut and taro chillers which have also been very good. Service is quick and for $5 can't go wrong with their house special!"}
{"text":"I love it here!  The staff is super friendly, and the drinks are SO good - my favourite is the watermelon with tapioca. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because it takes a really long time to get your order. I went in and got a drink for take out, just one drink, and it wasn't busy, and it took at least 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Terribly slow service for takeout. Place isn't packed at all nor there are a lot of people coming in for pickup. Staff wasn't friendly either-- complete turnoff when you're trying to order and the person at the front looks like you were bothering her. Bubble tea is also pricier than most.   Bubble tea is meh. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"The best bubble tea I've ever had. Always consistent. I recommend the caramel pudding bubble tea with mixed tapioca. I love that they offer small and large bubbles"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the bubble tea take out only.  I'm noticing a lot of the negative reviews are for the sit in meals and bubble tea.    I was expecting the worst at 3 stars only but I was kinda surprised on how much better the tea than your average spot.  Claiming a Taiwanese style of Bubble Tea, Bubble Republic offers some super affordable lunch options (less than $9 for lunch!) and a lot of Bubble Tea variations.  For me, I just wanted a really good black tea that is just a touch sweet.  On a Saturday early evening, the place was mostly empty but the take out line was pretty busy.  It's NO WHERE as busy as the Coco across the street.  There was maybe 3 people in the line at all times.  So it's not a crazy wait to get your order in.  Their menu has everything from chillers, regular black tea, fresh milk teas, and hot teas.  Sometimes there are teas that are just a made up name (like Magik) with no description... I figure if you're going to take the time to make up a name for a drink, at least describe it!  Service at the take out ordering was quiet and not really helpful but at least she was quick.  The line usually moved quickly enough.  After a 5 minute wait, we got our drinks and for the prices, I felt they were fair for Mississauga.  Definitely not as cheap as the spots in GTA East but we'll never see those crazy low prices.  Blueberry Milk Tea - This actually surprised me a bit... it was better than expected.  I thought this would be really superficial and fake but it was fairly true to the fruit.  Still a bit fake but not a terrible version.  At 30% sweet, this was still sweet and maybe its from the pearls in it.  I found these not to be as good as Coco but they werent overcooked or undercooked.  Pretty decent.  I would have liked a more real fruit flavour and the black tea to be a bit stronger but still better than your average spot.  3.5/5  Magik Milk Tea - Described as a black milk tea with coffee jelly.  Coffee and Black tea? SOLD!  I did appreciate how they gave me a good amount of coffee jelly and they werent crazily bigger than the straw (first world problems).  I ask for 50% sweet and found it to be right ... I think their pearls is soaking in a sugar syrup which really bump up the overall sweetness.  I honestly didnt find the coffee jelly to have any flavour... not really coffee and not sweet.  It was just... chewy.  As for the milk tea, I'm not sure if this was extra watery but I found the blueberry milk tea having a stronger tea flavour than mine.  It was not as watery as a bad spot but certainly missing that good bold tea flavour and a creaminess.  3/5  This spot for Bubble Tea take out is certainly not as bad as some of the reviews let on... though it sounds likes service and food quality is a big reason for the 2 stars.  As for bubble tea, the line up here is MUCH MUCH shorter than the Coco across the street.  If you choose your tea carefully, you might get a good cup for the same time the line up finally gets into the store."}
{"text":"Come to this place and you will most likely bump into someone you know. Everyone and their moms come here (LITERALLY) Still the best bubble tea joint I have ever tried. They dont skimp out on any of the calories because you can tell they use unicorn cream or something to make their drinks creamy, luscious and addicting. BE WARNED, you will crave for bbt again. Fridays they have Panna Cotta original milk tea which is my favorite. Don't expect the greatest service, the poor lads seem over worked providing for idunno....ALL OF MISSISSAUGA but they really do the best for how busy they are. Call in advance to save you crampled by the door! Only accept debit and cash!"}
{"text":"Wow, it took 30 min for 2 bubble teas on Monday night!!!   We asked the cashier after 25 min of waiting, and it looked as they totally forgot our order.  People came after us got theirs way before ours.    The cashier didn't even say sorry for the slow service. We saw few other people walked away also.    Will NEVER go back there again, this location is horrible."}
{"text":"I only ever get takeout here and although they can be slow at times, I think they do their best to move the line along. I love Bubble Republic for their unique drinks. They also carry the more traditional black/green teas and chiller flavours but my absolute favourite is the smash oatmeal chiller with mixed tapioca. It's a filling drink and a must get when we decide on bubble tea in Mississauga. I would recommend getting less ice if opting for a juice tea as they tend to be watered down in my experience."}
{"text":"This place is very near to my house. I tried before the blueberry greentea and really loved it. And this time i tried the food hear, the rice cooked well, not dry neither wet. The pork is very yummy and the egg also. I recommend who comes here should try it. They serve very fast although it is very crowded and very busy here. Good service, yummy food. I will try more."}
{"text":"The drinks are good but the wait was insane. I think it was 45 minutes for two drinks. It's not bad if I was ordering food and drinks but not for take out. I feel bad because the service isn't bad. They just don't enough staff so it isn't fair for the people working. They had two people not doing much and two people making drinks"}
{"text":"I constantly come back because I've had 1 good experience. BR has been Mississauga's staple since I could remember. Note: I'm not from Mississauga so I've heard all hype in the past few years. Recently, it eventually died down due to opening competitors (I.e Coco and Chatime). Anyways, I went in to try their raved about caramel pudding drink, it's good but not my go to. I've tried a variety of drinks there only to come to a conclusion that BR was mediocre, and tbh, I didn't get the hype. However, my friends still tell me how it used to be good back in the day. Eager to really taste what they always refer back to I kept giving BR a go. And what do you know, one night I ordered their pudding black Milk tea and it was GOOD. Like, so good! Their black Milk tea was made perfectly, in the sense that the tea flavours were prominent! BR tends to just taste like water downed tea with heavy milk. This is what has me coming back. I constantly hope for BR to really focus on their quality instead of their quantity because from what I've been told, their business has died down, A LOT. Their quality just decreased in the years and the other competitors have been stealing their business.  **Food is similar to fast food Taiwanese BBT food, but VERY mediocre**"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years and needless to say it never fails to disappoint! Apart from the price increase and semi-slow service (on weekends), I thoroughly enjoyed this venue location more than the hurontario Location. My absolute favourite drink is the caramel pudding milk tea with 30% sugar(they need to implement 10%)."}
{"text":"A popular bubble tea shop for late-night snackers. They're usually busy with takeout orders but I haven't had trouble finding a table for dine-in every time I visit. The menu consists of typical Taiwanese rice and noodle dishes along with shareable appetizers to enjoy with a group! I've been here several times and have tried most of their food items. Favourites include popcorn chicken, pork cutlet, and yaro balls. Entree items are decently-priced. The taste and quality of the food is above average. I would say the bubble tea here is average but their daily specials make it worth giving it a try!"}
{"text":"It's a great hang out place but with medicore food/bubble tea. It's dimly lit with scratched up walls with a poor paint job.   They only accept cash. No debit or credit. They have a minimum charge so you MUST order something. They will not Split the bill if you come in big groups.   My sons friend used to work here and the boss treats the staff horribly.   If any other bbt place opens up in miss it will easily top BR.     Average at best."}
{"text":"Omen was so so so delicious especially in a cold winter night. It runs pretty late every night and I love the service"}
{"text":"This place has a pretty large menu for tea to choose from. You can also sit down and eat or take tea to go. The menu is kind of confusing and doesn't have everything on it which makes it kind of difficult. I ended up ordering a peach tea with tapioca. It was yummy when I got it but I had to wait quite a while for it. I've been to other locations and got my tea within minutes so I'm not sure what was going on that had me waiting a half hour. The place wasn't that busy at all.  Either way, the tea is good, definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend stopping in here. I did not dine it, I just ordered a tea, but the experience was delightful. The place itself is very bright and welcoming. The staff I had interacted with were very nice. I ordered a tea and it was delicious. The peach green tea is what I got and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Large crowds of people, this place is usually full all times of the day & night. Their bubble tea is the best I've had with a vast array of flavours. My favourite is passion fruit black tea with tapioca (so, so delicious!)  they offer black tea variety, green tea, chillers & some snacks,  although I think most people go here for the bubble tea & not the food.  I've been coming here for years now & stay loyal to my favourite bubble tea spot!"}
{"text":"I love the daily deals and their chillers! I still need to try our their foods because they look affordable and smells and looks delicious!"}
{"text":"I already wrote about how the other bubble republic location is awful but how about this one? Well it's not as bad at least. The bubble tea is still ridiculously sweet but I learned my lesson from previous visits here so I asked for the 30% sweetness level so it tastes like what regular bubble tea should taste like. Aside from that the bubble tea tasted just like any other. The wait was a bit long but not horrible. I saw people waiting for take out for over 20 minutes though.  It's really loud here so it can be hard to have a conversation without yelling to match the environment. Oh and they don't take credit either. Just debit and cash."}
{"text":"We went again because my friend had a coupon for a free large drink. Despite that I think he regretted going here again. I know I did! I got a passionfruit green tea this time. Again there was a 25 minute wait for 2 drinks. They got my order wrong too so it ended taking about 35 minutes overall for my drink to come. It was really sweet again.. just as sweet as the first time which makes me wonder if they actually modified the sweetness in my order. Also, the smell and peeling paint were still there."}
{"text":"Bubble Tea Republic Has a large variety of bubble teas. Its a great place to chill with friends or grab a bubble tea to go. Have done both. Overall a great experience. My go to is the Oreo Taro which is really pleasant.  With the increasing number of bubble teas in the area  each one does one drink the best and  from Bubble Republic I recommend the Oreo Taro ."}
{"text":"What to try?  The caramel pudding milk tea and the Oreo milk tea. If you love milk tea and you love chewy textures, you'll like caramel pudding milk tea. You can even ask for no sugar if you want because the caramel pudding bites at the bottom are actually quite sweet already! The Oreo milk tea is usually the milk tea I like to recommend my first time goer friends because they're already familiar with Oreo and it's not found everywhere in Toronto this kind of unique drink. Usually they're impressed with it!  Last tip?  Take advantage of the daily specials because you can get a size of a large of the drink of the day for the price of a small. Saves some money. For example, caramel pudding drink is on special on Wednesdays usually. Their chillers which are crushed ice drinks are usually really good too. I also like their black diamond spa milk tea which has grass jelly and red bean!"}
{"text":"Is really hot today inside the store. Not sure why they not turn on the a.c. Everyone just boiling inside waiting their order to be ready. Not good at all."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I never wrote a review on this and I've been here so many times. This place is not bad for some taiwanese food and bubble tea. They have everyday drink specials which is good for carry out - these don't apply to food combos.  I always get combo number one with taiwanese noodles because that always stays consistent vs the rice dish. The veggies usually changes and it's super random. I like the noodles, it's soft. I think it's similar to egg noodles but it's more flat. The fried chicken comes on the side but I end up throwing a few pieces in the soup so it adds more flavour to it.  My main drink is the caramel pudding milk tea. Not much to say, I think it's one of the popular drinks. Another go to is the matchamisu which is ice blended tiramisu drink with some matcha powder on top and a ladyfinger. Only downside of this drink is that it doesn't apply with the food combos :(  They accept only debit now and if you want to split bills, just walk up to the counter and tell them what you're paying for.  A good place to chill and hang out for bbt!"}
{"text":"It's always busy, so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a bit. The bubble tea is the best in Mississauga though, so if this place is too busy for you, go visit the other location? Hahaha, i always get a lychee chiller & if I get food, it'll be Taiwanese sausages."}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of bubble teas. Food is ok. But they only accept cash or debit."}
{"text":"I hope they'd have enough seating for those waiting for take-out. The waiting area was so cramped. We had to decide to sit down, eat and order our take home.  The order took more than 40 minutes to be served. A couple behind us cancelled their order and left.  They should do something address the wait time for dine-in and take-out. It can't just be all, take, take, take...! Think about ways to improve your customer service wait time.  The counter top was also littered with used glasses. It's in the same area where new orders are served."}
{"text":"honestly I don't even know how much I spent here. I come here almost 2-3 times a week which is crazy but there bubble teas and food are pretty good. I like to call for my order. It's a lot faster and I don't have to wait. I just pick it up and go. Make sure you check for everything you have because sometimes they're will be something missing."}
{"text":"Try the honey dew black milk tea, it was good, however the store front is undergoing construction, with a tiny sign, making it hard to identify from outside."}
{"text":"Still great tasting bubble teas but......Mgmt needs to get In touch with realty.  Service is slow, long wait times consistently in evenings.  They need to train additional staff.  Add another two blenders and more prep space.  Common sense of business."}
{"text":"Newly renovated, modern paint job, new tables and open concept.  Definitely not a quiet place.  Lol.  A very popular hang out for \"youngins\"... Yutes, according to my daughter and My Cousin Vinny. Lol.    It's also opened late until 1am, so it's great for late night supper as well.  It's basically a Taiwanese casual resto which offers the famous popcorn chicken on rice (most favourite) and sesame paste noodles.  Of course it's a great place for bubble tea as well.  Lots of selections and interesting Taiwanese desserts too.    A good place to go for a quick snack, lunch or dinner or just bubble tea."}
{"text":"Heading into this establishment, you can already see the slightly damaged paint jobs. Oh well.  Dining in, the service is not so bad. Waitress gets our orders and we wait about 10 minutes to get some of our order. We ordered pork and chive dumplings which was pretty decent. I got my caramel pudding black milk tea with small tapioca first before my friend got her oreo chiller with large tapioca. I feel like the drinks should come together as I was already a quarter way down my drink before my friend even got hers.  This is the only decently close bubble tea place that I enjoy going to."}
{"text":"it really sucks, my friends even ate maggot in their fried chicken,guys do not go anymore"}
