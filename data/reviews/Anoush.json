{"text":"i went there with a Groupon. The food was really good and fresh. It is prepared right in front of you, almost from scratch. The problem is that there was only one lady preparing the food and there was lots of people coming in with the Groupon. We had to wait quite a bit to get our food (20 minutes maybe). Location is convenient and there is parking available."}
{"text":"Come for the food but stay for the staff!   Honestly not the best shwarma I have ever had, but it was later in the day so I can understand why the meat (beef) was a bit dry. The rice and salad were great, and the baklava was the best I have ever had. The friendly proprietor makes everyone feel welcome. It's just a small place in an average strip mall, but going in there I felt like I was eating amazing street food on the other side of the world. I would love to go back."}
{"text":"I ordered a beef shawarma and I thought the meat tasted like rubber. The pita is huge and it was falling apart so it was messy to eat. I left with a full stomach though. Service was satisfactory and the dining area was clean."}
{"text":"I absolutely love middle eastern - and no where do they do it better than Anoush! The very freshest ingredients, super friendly and accommodating staff, unbeatable value. You can design your own plate - make substitutions - no stupid extra charges either. Love it and wish they would deliver to my neighborhood. Conveniently located round the corner from Chesswood arena - great for after the game. Oh and - the place is spotlessly clean."}
{"text":"- eat somewhere else. anywhere else. - shawarma shouldn't taste that bad. notice how you dont see ethnic ppl eat here.... very telling sign....."}
{"text":"Walked in and it was empty on a Saturday for lunch.  Ordered the lamb kofka, which was almost a hidden menu item to the side.  It felt at first the lady ignored our order and moved onto the next person, but she then confirmed our order was just being cooked.  The rice was not that authentic, and the salad felt sort of watery.  The Koftka felt compressed, dense and overall just like a sausage.  Go to Baymian if you want better food like this."}
{"text":"The quick one liner: standard shawarma for $5.99, garlic sauce is underwhelming and for comparison I'd prefer Pita & Grill down the street or Bamiyan literally across the street.  For those who want to read on: The owners of this little spot are brave souls, with Paramount, Bamiyan Kababa and Pita & Grill all within the vicinity of this restaurant, they're going to have some tough competition.   This small shop located at the corner of Dixie and Eglington (connected to the Canadian tire gas bar store and Mary Browns) servers up falafel, chicken and beef schwarmas and dinner plates. I think they also have chicken breast kebabs, but I can't be sure. It's a small menu and small shop, meant to be a quick grab and go.   Some smart cookies running the place. They had a $2.99 promo running last week for a falafel, chicken or beef schwarma to get the word out (regular $5.99) and it did manage to generate some buzz as there were fairly long lines during lunch for the special. For $2.99, it's a steal...for $5.99.......... questionable.   I tried the chicken shawarma. The chicken didn't have much flavor, there wasn't a whole lot of meat, but it was larger than the tiny sandwich offerings at Paramount.  It was your standard chicken shawarma, topped with the standard lettuce, tomato, garlic sauce and hummus (you can add parsley as well, which I would recommend), wrapped in your standard pita and grilled in your standard panini press for several seconds. It may be because the line was long and they were trying to get people through, but the shawarma wasn't put in the press for long enough to do it's work. The whole thing was just standard, middle of the road shawarma.   As I mentioned, there are other middle eastern options in the area, and in my opinion they're all better than Anoush.  I was told the beef was better, and I'm willing to give it another try. Maybe it'll be a different experience if they're not rushed because of long lines."}
{"text":"I guess if you are looking for a different version of shawarma. Anoush is worth a try as it is basically a pita wrap trying its best to disguise as a shawarma.   Not to say that the shawarmas is not good but they are much smaller in size then a genuine Lebanese or Turkish or middle eastern shawarmas. I am pretty sure the new owners of this place are indian and that's why you don't get the authenticity of the shawarma taste.  Management seems to be wanting to save money. As it is very dark inside and when i went in the owner was writing on napkins and yelling at some young guys in front of a large crown because they wanted a student special but didn't have their ID.  I think the difference in price was .50 cents. Poor kids. Really mean lady. I had to mention that about a place where people get treated like that."}
{"text":"There are so many shawarma options in Toronto. Unlike Pho, I find significant differences among them. Some of them are swimming in oil. Some of them shave meat from the spit. Some of them just use some pre made meat in a tray. Some of them give you the purple sour thing. Some give you very little salad. Some don't even sell the skewers.   Where does Anoush stand? Somewhere in the middle. The food is good but it's not going to blow your mind. Like most shawarma places, it resembles a fast food place. You can get take out or dine in an empty table. They have the standard options of chicken, beef, falafel, with the addition of lamb. All of these can be on a pita or with rice/fries and salad. Standard stuff. They have grilled chicken skewers ready made. They have hummus and garlic sauce.   I was tempted to get the chicken skewer but when I looked at the tray, they look scrawny. No thanks. The Persian places near my house make the best kebobs. I went with beef and chicken shawarma. They tasted more or less as expected.   I find the prices a bit high but it feels somewhat justified because they have a good selection of salad items and dips. Most places don't give you hummus/garlic dip. The veggies tasted fresh. The container they use is also better than your typical Styrofoam. It's the kind you'd be happy to take home, wash and reuse.  Good food but nothing outstanding. The only shock factor is the location. Don't trust Google with this one. This place is within the plaza next to Starbucks. Google Map makes it look like it's on Rimrock. I wouldn't mind eating here again but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"After many times getting duped by their big orange sign and thought they were open, and getting stuck eating fried chicken, I finally found an opportunity to drop by today to get a Shawarma to go.   It's not bad. I found it quite yummy and at a good price point $5.99. There are a lot of staff here, but they make the line efficient; however, like most of these places it bottlenecks at the sole cash  register.   At the order station, he asks you what you want, and begins stuffing the pita with tomato, lettuce, hot peppers, pickled radish (not as salty as Paramount), and hummus. It passes to the next guy who fills it with meat and hot sauce and garlic sauce.  Then they put it in a grill. I like this because it heats up the pita and fillings and you don't get one bite of Cold, and one bit of Hot, or god forbid, a weird sensation biting into both.   It was quite yummy. Flavourful without a strong overwhelming taste. It's got competition in the area, but it's different and from a different place \"Middle Eastern\" (as opposed to Afgani).  It's also much healthier than the fast food places.   They also have Beef Shawarma, Chicken, Kofta (lamb) and Falafel.  There are seating, but really limited, and the atmosphere isn't something you'd really want to stay for.  As it's attached to the Canadian Tire Gas Bar, I wonder if you can sneak into that seating area to nom on your Pita.  Otherwise, it's a great grab and go back to your cubicle type of place."}
{"text":"Great beef shawarma plate my fave I tried so far.  Only thing I've tried because it's so good and filling.  If on the area and a fan of these types of dishes you owe it to yourself to try it out."}
{"text":"This one is not as good as the hwy 7 and 400 location by the Walmart   I have been here twice and each time the food is average. It always seems so dark. And the food looks tired."}
{"text":"Anoush is a simple straight forward shawarma / Mediterranean restaurant / hole in the wall location. I got the rice potatoes and shawarma plate and it was ok. Nothing really bad about it but not that great either just another run of the mill shawarma place.  Very small and crowded so not perfect place to eat lunch with friends"}
{"text":"Service was alright. The food was less than satisfactory. The falafel was too far too salty to finish, and everything else tasted poor."}
{"text":"When this place opened, it used to be good. (Back in 2014)   I came by here today for some takeout, and was disappointed with the both the quality and the portion of chicken shawarma.  The platter was loaded with potatoes, and barely any chicken. That and the fact that for a place that primarily sells shawarma, the chicken was dry; only to be remedied by drenching it with sauces.   Service was friendly, but food was not good. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"They have the best weekend deals. The worst customer service with stinky food. Never ever will waste my money their."}
{"text":"Portion size is good, and potato/chicken lunch deal is pretty good.   Has gone downhill pretty badly over the years. Chicken is not cut to order off the slab of meat, rather left in a bowl and reheated. They charge for additional toppings like olives in shawarma sandwiches.   At this point, I will only go here if forced to for convenience."}
{"text":"Flavour of chicken is really good!  I got the chicken shawarma meal, no rice or potatoes. The amount of salad I got was stingy....., If im not getting rice or potatoes at least compensate me with more salad"}
{"text":"The earlier in the day you come, the better and juicier the shawarma is. By the end of the day, it has a beef jerky texture. Seasoning and sides on the platter are absolutely delicious. Extra tzatziki is a favourite of mine on the beef shawarma platter."}
{"text":"This is a good value for money place. Nothing special, nothing terrible. Generally favorable middle eastern cuisine. It has a simple menu and a lot of little options to tweak the food the way you like."}
{"text":"Delicious!   Another spot close to work. You're looking at a $10 dollar lunch but you're getting a $10 portion and the quality matches the quantity.   You can stop in, order, pay, and be on your way in minutes with take out (granted there isn't a lunch line up). Or you can eat in as well. If there is a line it moves quick.   Ohh-mahh-gawwwd, the garlic sauce here is amazing but be prepared to taste this meal for the rest of the day if you ask for extra!   I'm far from an expert in middle eastern cuisine, but I know what tastes good, Anoush will rock your taste buds. Give it a shot for sure if you're into this style of cooking. Actually give it a shot regardless, it's that good."}
{"text":"Quick delivery service - ordered via Just-eat.  Reasonable price for a 2 person meal & very tasty - would try again."}
{"text":"I'm guessing this place is busy at lunch time, because it was completely dead at 7:30 on a weeknight but the trash cans were full.   Secondly, the ONLY thing from the menu was dry, overcooked chicken and the only other thing they had were 4 falafel that I'm really not sure how long had been sitting there.Other items they SHOULD have had were beef, kabobs, etc. - none.   Won't be back and won't be recommending to nearby businesses."}
{"text":"Lacklustre shawarma at best. My biggest issues is that they don't cut it fresh off the spit, rather give it to you from some pile of precut chicken. I don't understand this concept. The whole allure of eating a shawarma is watching the chicken fall gloriously into a collection plate. Get it together."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised with the high scores and reviews on the place. The three of us that went there were thoroughly disappointed. The service was fantastic but the food was terrible. We were starving so normally anything would taste good at that point but just disgusted. We threw out most of what we ordered. This place brings shame to Middle eastern food. I don't know if there is a lack of similar restaurants close by and so they don't have any competition or the ones that have reviewed this place haven't really tasted how heavenly Arabic food can be. The prices are way too high for the low quality of food they serve. Never again!"}
{"text":"It's alright, I've been here a few times. The food is decent, it sucks a bit that you have to pay for some toppings."}
{"text":"This place is decent at lunch when everything is fresh. Free soup with any wrap. Comparable to your standard shawarma place, but not amazing. Will return if in the area"}
