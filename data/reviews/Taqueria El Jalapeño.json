{"text":"Best tacos in Madison hands down! Excellent service. Hand made carved booths from Jalisco."}
{"text":"I don't get the negative reviews this place is getting.  I've been on a \"taco quest\" lately and this is so far my fave joint in Madtown.  The tortillas are fresh, warm, fluffy, obviously made right there, as they should be.  I've been three times so far and tried a lot of the fillings, and they have all been flavorful, filling but not gut-bombs, and satisfying.  I even like the refried beans, which is usually a throw-away add-on to a plate.  A lot of the other taco places around here either seem to serve dried-out tortillas, and rubbery store-bought ones.  And I hate it when they glop a ton of sloppy filling into a tortilla so it falls apart.  El Jalapeno totally avoids that trap.  I will definitely be back many times to try more tacos, and explore the non-taco side of their menu.  Plus the people are so friendly, and the space is cozy and inviting, it just makes me and my wife happy to be there.  Totally recommend without reservation!"}
{"text":"If you want to have authentic Mexican food, go to Tagueria.  The food is really good and people are very friendly.  If you go to this place and you are one of the few people who are not Mexicans, you know it's a good place.  The location is not the best, especially that is right by a very busy road, but it doesn't matter after their first tasty Margarita"}
{"text":"We have had eaten here a couple of time in the last two months.  We also are not local to Madison and from the West Coast so lots of experience with legit Mexican.  Solid tacos and sopes, at a really good price and great service.  We were asked if we wanted a different hot sauce for more heat and it was great."}
{"text":"Great little, super quick, real Hispanic fun restaurant.   Not fancy, but good food and kid friendly."}
{"text":"I've gotta say, I'm really happy about this place.  I'm a Mexican guy from SoCal, who's also spent a bunch of time in San Diego, so I've seen my share of taquerias.  This place, though not world class, does several things right.  First of all, the service here is good. It's easy to get neglected/ignored in some taquerias - it just part of the deal.  Second, and this is big for me, the refried beans are very good. Most places don't get them right, but these are excellent. I had the carnitas (fried pork roast)  plate. The carnitas were moist and tender and not fatty at all. My wife had tacos which were meaty and tasty (and cheap).  The asada was solid. The real winner was our teenage son, who had the suizo burrito.  It's a gigantic burrito stuffed with meat, beans and rice (but mostly meat) smothered in cheese sauce and sour cream.  Kind of like a mammoth Mexican cheesesteak. It even had more cheese inside of it.  He was giddy. He went into a crazed feeding frenzy and said it was one the best things ever.  They also had horchata, a creamy rice drink, which is delicious and not all places have it.  I rate restaurants by whether I'd go there if they were in L.A.  I wouldn't drive very far to get to El Jalapeño in L.A., but now I live in Madison. I may go again tomorrow."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had dinner at this place yesterday evening.  We ordered chicken fajitas, shrimp ceviche and a side order of refried beans.  She had a margarita and I had a Spotted Cow beer.  The food and the drinks tasted good and the service was efficient and friendly.  However, my girlfriend got sick last night and was throwing up.  I was fine last night, but got sick this morning.  Maybe the food preparation hygiene needs to be improved."}
{"text":"First of all I quite enjoy the decor of this place. Fun and colorful, many  depicting the harvest of the agave (for mezcal perhaps?).  Second, I open up the menu to find mojarra frita, an authentic traditional dish I've had a few times in the homes of friends. For those who don't know that is a whole fish (tilapia most likely), head included, fried whole and served with tortillas. The dish was moist and with a squeeze of lime and some Valentina it was a pleasent afternoon lunch.  The carne asada my wife had was moist and had pretty good flavor as well. Not amazing but respectable.  On the downside, I wish the fish was served with a bit more avocado than the small sliver I got and perhaps some homemade salsa that would go with it. Also the rice and beans were just ok which is too bad as it gives those two staples of mexican cuisine a poor name (numerous restaurants are guilty of downplaying these two dishes). If done right just give me a place of beans and rice and some flour tortillas and salsa and let me go to town.  Final verdict though is that the people are very friendly and the food is respectable. I will most likely swing by again soon and grab myself a torta."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! Great little restaurant with deliciously fresh food and fun friendly waitstaff. Go for tacos and burritos and homemade soups and then take a wAlk next door and take a browse through the Mexican Market. The margaritas were delicious as well!"}
{"text":"I lived on the Mexican border of Texas in my childhood. My parents took us into Mexico often. We had a Mexican-American live-in housekeeper who cooked for us... so, I know MY food, both Tex-Mex and Mexican.   El Jalapeño is the \"real deal.\" Living in Nakoma, a few blocks away, we've been there since it opened and returned time and again. The owners are from Jalisco, the seating made of hand-crafted Jalisco painted wood, complimented by original oil paintings. The lighting is bright... as is customary in Mexico!  The food is fantastic. There are many on here who complain about this or that (mainly, it seems, the salsa that comes with the chips.) Why so much focus on the salsa?! The chips are home-made, fresh and hot. Ask for another salsa (a hotter, richer flavored one, as we did) and move on!   The food is what this place is about and it is DELICIOUS and AUTHENTIC. This is much, much more than a 'tacos joint.' In fact, the 'Carne Asado' entree platter at  $ 10.99 is a steal. Thin slices of flank steak, perfectly grilled accompany fresh, hot corn tortillas, along with cactus leaf (delicious,) a chopped Mexican lettuce salad, rice and beans. No lard or trans fat, so the latter two were light and flavorful. The platter was huge, almost enough for two.  I love their 'Enchiladas Platter' also. You can choose the filling: steak, pork, chicken, etc. and they are perfectly cooked and yummy.  We've had most everything on the menu. There is nothing I wouldn't order again, the food is that good.... and so very, very reasonable for the quality. Most dinner or lunch entrees are $ 7.99.  Service is friendly, delightful and unobtrusive. One pays at the cash register (as in Mexico,) when one is ready to leave. We love that!  By the way, the local Mexican-American population has discovered El Jalapeño. It is packed with families and others, which is the best sign that this place is authentic and just like \"madre\" used to make!    We are thrilled to have such a terrific Mexican place as El Jalapeño nearby."}
{"text":"Although the food was decent (I used to live in San Diego, so I know what really good Mexican cuisine tastes like), I was somewhat alienated by the service I received, and felt like I was the victim of a bait and switch.  While placing my order for a burrito and chimichanga online, I opted to include chips and salsa with the chimichanga, which listed a cost of $0.50 to do so. I also asked for guacamole on the side in the notes for my chimichanga since adding guacamole wasn't an option. When I got there to pick my order 20 minutes later, it wasn't ready yet. Furthermore, I was informed that the chips and salsa were actually $1.99, and that there was an error with the price ordering through yelp. Rather than giving me the benefit of the doubt for their mistake, I had to pay 4 times the cost for the chips and salsa that I had agreed to when placing my order. I was also informed the guacamole was $1 extra for a tiny cup of it on the side.  Another 10 minutes or so later, I got my order, and took it home for my gf and I to eat. The chimichangas were pretty good, but apparently her burrito wasn't very good, and the main ingredient in it appeared to be lettuce.  Based solely on the food, I'd say this place would be a 3 star joint. But based on them sticking it to me for their pricing mistake, and the length of time it took to get my order (BTW, when I got there, they didn't seem at all busy), the cost of the order (nearly $20), and the overall quality, I'm giving them a 1. Hopefully this will balance out the current undeserved (IMO) 4 star rating.  The search for a great Mexican restaurant in Madison continues."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Mexican restaurant. Small place nothing fancy just good food and great service. Will go again soon."}
{"text":"Great spot, was just visiting for thanksgiving and made it out to jalapeños, I had a great lunch and the staff was very friendly and the prices we good. I will return."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican restaurant I have had so far in Madison. Food came out 5 mins after ordering. And it was cold and not appetizing. My wife had the burrito, she took two bites and didn't care for more. Not going back."}
{"text":"If I could eat 14 tacos in a row, I would go here. Carne Asada, Pastor, Lomo, Lengua (Beef tongue), Tripa, Buche (pork stomach), oh my!! Seriously - 14 different kinds of tacos!   Sadly, I only had four: 1) Pollo - delicious!  2) Pull pork - even more delicious than the chicken. I could eat this all day long. 3) Pastor - decent 4) Carne Asada, I wish I hadn't saved this for last. It tasted like they didn't even add any spices.  As for the decor - the benches are brightly colored wooden scenes and kind of neat to see on their own.  Margaritas were a little pricier than I was expecting. When you're done eating, pay at the counter near the door.  Overall - a solid taco recommendation."}
{"text":"I brought my family here to try it out. The food was tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to other Mexican restaurants. Salsa was a bit \"watery\". Our food was made very quickly. We felt very comfortable bringing our kids here. I will be back in the future."}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly. Super good food and very affordable. Margaritas are great. Love the tostada de ceviche!"}
{"text":"Always the best service as well as amazing food! Their chips come out warm and salsa is amazingly fresh. Best ceviche in town as well as carnitas. Always satisfied, will come here again and again!"}
{"text":"When I travel to Mexico, I usually seek out locals' favorites there. This taqueria is authentic and delicious, and is a favorite by those of Mexican descent right here in Madison. The owners/servers are all very friendly and hard-working, the room is clean and comfortable, and the decor is festive. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hard to imagine, but the best tacos in Madison area. The carnitas on Friday and Saturday's is amazing."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the quality of the food and the huge portions! Convenient location on our work commute-cant believe we hadn't carried out a long time ago!"}
{"text":"Move over, Guadalajara, this place has replaced your spot in my belly/heart.   First of all, this place has micheladas to die for. Que es eso? Beer with lime juice, chile powder, and salt. If you like bloody Marys and beer, give this a shot. Yumtastic.   Their handmade tortillas are mad fresh n fluffy, which makes their gorditas and sopes killaaahh. Try a chorizo gordita...RIGHTNOW.   The service is also friendly, though it can be a bit slow at times. Also be warned that you pay extra for a second helping of chips and salsa, though it's less than $2.   Go here for dinner, and follow it up with a cocktail at Le Tigre Lounge. Evening of champions."}
{"text":"Delicious Tacos! We had the chicken, carne asada, and shredded pork. The chicken and pork were especially tasty. We also enjoyed the chips and salsa and a horchata to drink. All in all, it was a delicious meal. Only down side was the heart burn afterwards, but I'll still give 5 stars"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for some tacos. As always the food was great and service excellent. Not sure why the vegetarian would go here?? It's for people who eat meat. Not people that eat rabbit food. Maybe find a salad bar somewhere else. Over all always solid food with great service and you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Sterotypical decor...  fajitas were really tasty though and the serving was generous."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and delicious. For the 3 of us we had 7 tacos and soda. Our total cost was $21. Can't beat that. Love their beef tongue taco. If u love spicy, don't forget to ask for their special spicy sauce. It goes so good with their tacos."}
{"text":"Was a little skeptical based on other reviews, but decided to give it a try for our lazy Sunday meal.  Ordered combo and chicken tacos and the 2 chimi meal  Food was great, delivered warm.   Was able to track our delivery. Will definitely utilize this service again for this place!"}
{"text":"Really delicious Mexican food. I ordered the veggie tostada and veggie quesadilla via grubhub delivery. First was the tostada. I mistakenly poured too much of their salsa on top of the tostada and my tongue and lips were tingly by the time I was finished. The tortilla was perfectly crisp even after delivery and being topped with a mountain of beans, rice, lettuce, sour cream and tomatoes. The one reason I dislike delivery is the food quality usually goes down in transport. This was most definitely not the case with this order.  I was so full after one tostada that I only managed two bites of my quesadilla and the rest went in the fridge for leftovers."}
{"text":"The service was great!!!  That is all. Food was mediocre at best. Carne asada was tasteless and over-cooked. It was so thin it looked like gyro meat but had no flavor. Ordered guacamole and it was mostly tomatoes and what looked like \"avocado cream\". Bland.  All food was barely warm (cheese wasn't even melted). Not my idea of good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Our latest stop for \"margs and tacos\" night.  Per typical standard, you receive a basket of (warm) chips and salsa upon seating. The salsa was just ok, and if you want more chips, $1.99 extra. We ordered the cheese dip appetizer which came with only a few more chips, so we ended up having salsa and dip leftover because we were being jerks and didn't want to pay another $1.99.  The standard margarita is very sweet and definitely just a bottled mix, however, if you ask, they will make a more authentic version.  Our table ordered the fajitas, molcajete and enchiladas. All was delicious. Our service was friendly but not the most prompt on an evening that wasn't terribly busy.  We waited for quite a while before we assumed we must have to go up to the register to receive and pay our bill. Not a big deal, but it would've been nice if the server told us that as we had cash sitting on the table waiting and she walked by several times.  I would definitely come back and try the tacos since that seems to be a hit and I was happy with all the other food we ordered.   But I'd have to agree with another Yelper that to date, Tienda Los Gemelos is by far my #1."}
{"text":"Super good food, but I'm pretty sure they just heat it up in the back when you order."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican food I've ever had. The restaurant is small but comfortable. We were able to sit down right away and the service was friendly and fast.   I couldn't decided what I wanted so I did the A la carte option. I tried a beef Gordita and a chicken chimichanga. It was amazing. So amazing that I went back less than a week later for the chimichanga meal.   The A la carte menu is awesome! You can choose between a taco, tamale, Gordita, enchilada, or chimichanga.   They also serve a basket complimentary of chips and salsa with your meal!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant based on the reviews. I am so glad we did! The restaurant is clean and the furnishings are very cute with Mexican decor. The blended strawberry margarita was very good just the right amount of alcohol.The warm chips were delicious and the salsa was home made. Many choices on the menu. My husband had the carnitas and he said they were very good. I ordered the Suiza burrito, it was HUGE and so good. You have a choice of meats for your burrito. Mine was shredded pork. They prefer cash payment but take credit cards and debit cards. They also have an ATM in the restaurant to the right of the bar. There is a short bar with 5 stools if you would like to just stop in for a beer or margarita. The wait staff was friendly. Give it a try!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty tasty. We started with cheese sauce and guacamole. The guacamole was made to order, it was so creamy and good. The chips are fried fresh so super tasty.  He had carnitas and they were flavorful and good. I had chicken flautas (no lettuce) and they were fried to perfection. We also tried one steak taco with just cheese. The steak was super flavorful and if I would have known it was that good I would have ordered more tacos.  Try this place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican cuisine. I'm from San Antonio, so I have a peculiar taste for Tex-Mex food. Living in Madison, there really isn't much that stands out as fantastic but this place had its pros...  1.) steak milanesa was yummy 2.) staff was super sweet 3.) food was quick n hot 4.) margaritas were good and 2 for 1 5.) beans weren't from a can 6.) salsa was unique w/ a hint of cilantro 7.) rice was okay 8.) chicken enchiladas were good 9.) nice tables n chairs 10.) kid friendly  I would go back no question. :)"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican joint. Quick and friendly service. The horchata is bomb. Guacamole is good and cheap. Overall, really enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"I got the lunch sampler plate with Mexican sausage as the meat. Excellent! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today.  Friendly staff and charming decor!  Food was very good, great service, too.  Will definitely return to try other choices from their interesting menu."}
{"text":"Service- no complaints. Meal served in good time Menu- tad small, but sometimes helps in Mexican cuisine Taste- fair.  Some of pork meat to pork taco was chewy and could not be broken down       Open burrito was good Beverage- had Corona light, not on the menu  Mentionables: -as someone else said, not really any vegetarian options -they do not give you your bill. You have to go up front to pay, and there is a tip jar up there. Suppose you could also leave cash on the table... -chips and salsa--would have been nice to have a hotter salsa option.   might go back"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever. Seriously. And the staff is extremely nice and accommodating. I order and they don't make me feel silly with my lack of Spanish skills, which I really appreciate. We frequent here for lunch to pick up tacos. The variety and the quality is amazing. They wrap the take out with care, and it's still hot when you get home. I think everyone should stop here for some amazing food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are thrilled that El Jalapeno is open and in our neighborhood. We've been there twice in the past month. He always gets the tacos... each a different kind. I've had the carnitas and shredded pork torta. It tastes just like what we used to be able to find in Houston. We are SO thankful for authentic Mexican tastes and for the efforts of this family, as it is clearly a family business. Service was prompt and thoughtful - the waitress even helped Husband remember how to order jalapenos \"toreados\", which is grilled/blackened like he likes them. We will keep visiting this perfect little place!"}
{"text":"Good food, which includes standard Americanized Mexican dishes and more authentic opinions for the more adventurous palate.  There is lots of good Mexican cuisine in the area, but what keeps us coming back to el Jalapeno is their service.  We have met friends there and every time the staff have quickly accommodated our large group, which has included 3-5 young kids.  The experience is nothing flashy, but for a good, quick meal it's a fun pick."}
{"text":"We had fajitas and chips with salsa and queso.  Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"They have a convenient location off of the beltline and a good selection of beers. I can always count on them to have pork carnitas. I've never had a problem with my meal here. Their parking lot is a little confusing and when you enter the restaurant you usually have a good minute of confusion on whether you seat yourself or get seated, just awkward at first."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious and affordable.  Love the shrimp tacos with grilled onions and cilantro.  Their posole soup (only available on weekends) is awesome."}
{"text":"The tacos here are tasty!  I'm glad I decided to give this place a try.  This location used to be La Guanajuatence, which had an amazing salsa bar and delicious tacos.  This new restaurant doesn't boast a salsa bar and the salsa they serve with the chips is mediocre, but the tacos are still tasty.    I ordered the carne asada taco, chorizo taco, lengua taco and a chicken tamale with onions and cilantro on everything. They brought out a smoky salsa in a squeeze tube with the tacos.  The lengua taco was delicious.  The beef tongue was tender and juicy.  The chorizo taco was full of flavor.  Chorizo can be very greasy but I felt that this was just right for me.  Everything was ordered a la carte, so no rice and no beans and that's just how I prefer it.    The only thing I was not a fan of the chicken tamale.  I found it too heavy in the masa and light on the filling. It felt dry, and I wouldn't order it again.  It's a shame because apparently the market in the same plaza makes amazing tamales on the weekends.    I haven't tried other things on the menu, and honestly, I probably never will.  Tacos are what I love and I almost never want anything else."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to my hotel room while in town on a business trip. I got 2 pescado and 1 shrimp taco. Delivery was quick, I used the Eatstreet app. Tacos were okay, a little soggy by the time I got them. The hot sauce and limes they provided, made all the difference. I ended up just taking out the taco fillings and eating them with the rice and refried beans. Overall tasty but sogginess made them...Meh  Also as I mentioned I'm in a hotel...minus a star because I was given rice and beans but not given any utensils!"}
{"text":"Okay so I moved to madison about 5 years ago and ever since I have been on the hunt for good authentic mexican food. I think I've finally found it. My boyfriend and I decided to order it for delivery (that's one of the downsides is that the delivery service is slow...takes about hour to an hour and a half to get your food) anyways. The first time we ordered, our food arrived cold which isn't the restaurants fault it's the service but even though it was cold it was still good! How does that even happen?! We always get a Pollo taco, a tamale, guacamole and flautas. The chicken is sometimes a little dry but once you throw some hot salsa on it, it's fine. All in all I like it and can appreciate that they prepare the tacos traditionally. (Corn tortillas, cilantro and onion yummy!!!)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this little place! It's hard to find, especially now with all the construction but it's worth the adventure! We came on a Sunday evening and were one of only two couples there. We received menus and our order of chips and salsa while we decided. I ordered flautas and the SO ordered chimichangas, and we split a tamale. All the meat we chose was chicken and it had a really good flavor. The tamale had too much masa for our liking but the flautas and chimis were really flavorful. The salsa is fresh and has a good flavor, not spicy at all. Adding the hot sauce will definitely give it the kick you need! I enjoy how quick the service is, how servers leave you to eat and how overall this place is all about the food, no fuss about extra things. Just a tip, they prefer cash!"}
{"text":"Ate in for lunch.  The good: Beer was cold, and service was fast.  The bad: To start, it smelled like there was a plumbing issue in the restaurant. I ordered the \"vegetable\" (note, not \"vegetarian\") tacos lunch and was served tacos with beans, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Was expecting roasted or sauteed vegetables, not beans. And I certainly expect onions and cilantro rather than lettuce and tomato at a taqueria. The beans were flavorless, the rice not much better. When I asked for the fountain soda that was included in the lunch special, I was given a completely flat soft drink. Finally, in my opinion, the prices are a little high, and I was not offered a receipt when I paid.  Overall: Would give them a second try, but certainly wouldn't pay for it."}
{"text":"The word that stuck in my head was 'pedestrian'.  The food is pedestrian.  Its ok.    Its your basic, mid-tier city Mexican. Space is cool as they have a lot of colorful, handmade Mexican art.    Pork tacos were ok.  Beans were meh.  Rice was ok.  Salsa tasted like a jar.  Chips were bagged.    If we were in Marshfield (from whence they came) this would serve fine.  But in Madison there are better options."}
{"text":"All their food is good but their liver tacos are particularly delicious. Very good service and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Reviewing as it happens: Unsavory location prevented me from visiting sooner. It's 5:36 pm on a Saturday night and the place is mostly empty. It's bigger inside than I expected. Friendly staff seem honestly grateful for customers. They really want me to order a drink but their margaritas are made from a mix (meh) so I pass. Free chips and salsa are a C+. Not stale but not fresh either. I ordered a trio of tacos - pork, chicken and fish. Served in double homemade soft corn tortillas. Meat, cilantro and onions are the only ingredients in each. Chicken is very good; moist. No cheese. Could have used something. Fish taco is also OK. Pork has more flavor (duh) but is a tiny bit dry and super salty. Perhaps their best dish isn't tacos but that will have to wait until next time. The prices are reasonable and I'd come back."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant close(ish) to home.  No nonsense taqueria style food.  Definitely some of the best horchata in town.  Weekend specials are not to be missed.  Yesterday, opted for the carnitas.  How can you argue against unctuous braised pork?  Served with rice, beans, corn tortillas, and some cilantro, tomato, and onions it is the epitome of comfort food.  Always friendly waitstaff and the owners are typically on hand.  One of my go-to mexican places here in town."}
{"text":"We are from Texas and love this place. Reminds us of DFW mom and pop places. The food is great and so are the prices. Love the shrimp and fish tacos. Margaritas are good and toxic. Get the sopapia as well."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of all of the taqueria's in Madison. Prices were reasonable and we tried five different tacos, which were pretty tasty (fish, beef tongue, steak, pork, and a combo). I was also pretty jealous of my friends who got the fajitas, so would have to try that next time. They have a machine that is churning horchata that I'd love to try in the future also.  I would say that if I had to choose though, Tienda Los Gemelos still ranks number one, but that may be a personal bias and you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Awesome decor!  Come at least to pick a cool chair to sit in and THEN enjoy the yummy food.  Fast, plenty and reasonably priced.  I had the chicken tacos (hard shell tortillas).  Really liked the rice, too."}
{"text":"Tacos in the morning, tacos in the evening, tacos at supper time, when tacos are on a tortilla you can have tacos any time!  Great tacos (especially the pastor and carne asada), good tamales, and wonderful gorditas. Also the horchata is among the best I've ever had.  I've been here on a few occasions and would say it ranks in the top three taco places in Madison. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food that they had here. Prices were reasonable and the portions were fair. I've only tried the tacos here and they were all great! I especially like the fish tacos and the steak ones. My friend got a fajita plate and that looked amazing! Next time I'm going to come back and try that!"}
{"text":"The tamales were tasty and the service was great. My server, Angelica, was very friendly and helpful. I went here for lunch. The food was fresh, came out quickly, and was a good value. It was nice to have some authentic Mexican food this far from my home in Colorado, where I've gotten spoiled with its abundance."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, fresh. Try the flautas with chicken, or the gorditas with steak. The hot sauce is nice and spicy and flavorful. We get takeout from here about every other week and the food is consistently delish. Even the rice and beans are good."}
{"text":"This place has great mexican!  We got tacos of 4 different types.  All were great, but the el pastor (barbecue pork) was amazing.  The homemade chips and salsa were also really good -- the salsa had a touch of mexican oregano in it giving it a great flavor.  I would highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite taqueria in the city hands down.  The spot reminds me of Mexican food trucks in LA. The menu is very standard: tacos, burritos, asada, and some other basics.  Typically when I come I'll order the burrito; medium or large depending on how hungry I am.  I'm a purist so it's rice, beans, and meat in the burrito for me.  I've had the chicken, lomo, and carne asada in the burrito and I love it all.  For me this is the best thing on the menu.  The meat is well seasoned and it's just really good!  I've also had most of their tacos and have loved those also.  Their tortillas are made fresh too! How awesome is that?!  Their fresh salsa is a bit watery but you see that it's fresh so no complaints here.  Also, they bring out this super spicy salsa in this red container with the salsa that is SO good!!!   The place is also always clean and the service is quick!"}
{"text":"Yes, I love their steak burrito, it's still true! But I've been trying some of their other delicious options as well. If you're here on a Saturday or Sunday, you've got to try the carnitas!"}
{"text":"Ok let me preface this by stating that I've only eaten the inexpensive tacos there and they are yummy and awesome especially for the price! Around $2 for each Taco so a couple of them make for a good light meal along with the complimentary chips n salsa. Very warm and competent staff that takes great care of you.    Perhaps I will try other menu items and report back but for now I'll stick to my favs. I always get excited when I know I'm going there and leave the place all warm and fuzzy. Not too many places like that anymore!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but it was some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had. I ordered the suizo burrito and it tasted like ballpark nacho cheese on a tortilla. It was so bad that I couldn't stomach more than a few bites. Taqueria El Jalapeño strikes me as a very \"fast food\" version of good Mexican and I will not be revisiting."}
{"text":"I had never been here before, but decided to check the reviews. There was quite a mix, those that rave and those not raving so much :). That made me more intrigued to try it out. Here is my take.   The place was clean, service was fast and friendly, and the food was out in no time. That's a good start.   Before I even placed my order I had chips and salsa in front of me. The salsa as other described was a bit watery. You might describe it as a rougher chop salsa, rather than a smooth blended salsa. At first, it tasted fine, but as I ate more there was some ingredient I just couldn't place my finger on. But whatever it was, it wasn't my favorite. The salsa became my least favorite part of my meal.   I ordered the taco lunch (2 tacos, rice, beans, drink) for $7.99.  I got a chorizo taco and a steak and pork taco. You can choose between lettuce and tomato or cilantro and onion. I opted for what feels more authentic cilantro and onion.   I thought the tacos were great. Authentic with two corn tortillas for each with some homemade hot sauce on the side. I would happily order both again.   I also thought the beans were good and the rice was fine, but nothing spectacular.   I was torn between a 3 and 4 star review. In the end, the odd ingredient flavor of the salsa pushed me to a 3 star. I mean salsa is a cornerstone of a good Mexican restaurant.   I'd eat here again, but if their salsa has anything extra besides the usual ingredients, they should probably alter their recipe."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here three hours after lunch still in a satiated daze with a belly full of carnitas (a special available only on weekends)...  To my own detriment, perhaps, I tend to avoid Mexican restaurants that have goofy caricatures wearing sombreros and hoisting a burrito or a margarita as their logo (and what is this thing anyway?  A jalapeño?  Looks like an avocado...) but this place is the real deal.  With apologies to my other favorite west-side Mexican place (Tienda Los Gemelos), I think this place is a little bit better, and definitely has a more extensive menu. Service is always friendly but like a lot of Mexican restaurants don't wait around for your check-- just head up to the register when you are done.  Everybody always comments on the chips and salsa(s) when they rate these kinds of places so  here goes-- chips have been hit or miss but today we got a huge basket of warm, crispy chips with nice, fresh, salsa.  There was a squeeze bottle of some much hotter salsa on the table that I had with the carnitas."}
{"text":"Consistently great food. I love the colorful tables and chairs. We usually order off the ala carte menu (tacos, sopes, tostatas etc) to get a variety of eats. 2 or 3 things off this menu is the perfect amount of food."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and am a big fan of their tacos and their carnitas on the weekends.  It seems like in my experience, this place is at it's best when it is making more authentic Mexican food, as opposed to Tex-mex.  I always get lengua (tongue), tripa (tripe/intestine) and campechano tacos, and they are all excellent.  I get the feeling some of the people who have had bad experiences have ordered less authentic dishes.  Their burritos and nachos tend to be less than stellar in my experience, so if someone only ordered those, I could see them being underwhelmed.  On the weekends, the carnitas are about as good as it gets.  A huge portion with rice and beans for about $8 or $9, so good.  I see lots of negative comments about the salsa, and I agree it isn't the best, but it isn't horrible either.  Also, it is free salsa, how much can you really complain about it?  On the plus side, I find their hot sauce to be very good; good flavor, heat, and definitely homemade.  Stick with the authentic dishes, especially tacos, and you can't really go wrong.  Some of the best authentic tacos in town."}
{"text":"This place was better than anticipated. Clean, not busy during lunch, fair prices and high quality food. Tostadas and burritos were excellent. This is our new go-to place for Mexican food. Would recommend over Laredo or other places near by. 2 lunch options plus drinks chips and salsa for $17. Well worth your time."}
{"text":"This place is super delicious and the atmosphere is full of vibrant colors. We went on a Sunday, lured in by the carnitas special and $5 margaritas. The margaritas are definitely worth the splurge and pack a tequila punch.   The carnitas special came with a large portion of pico de gallo, rice, beans, and about 6 corn tortillas. Everything was super delicious and paired with the smoky, hot sauce that is brought out with the chips makes it perfect. I would highly recommend this dish.  My dining companion ordered the burrito suizo and while it was absolutely huge it comes smothered in nacho cheese sauce...this seems odd and not quite what we were expecting. Delicious, just different.   I definitely will be back her to try the tacos. I think sticking to the simpler items seems to be the best way to ensure a good meal here."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first opportunity to try El Jalapeno.  I ordered take out at the restaurant.  Since I am a vegetarian, I need to whine, just a tad.  The menu does not have a separate section for vegetarian dishes as many of the other Mexican restaurants do here in Madison.  See...just a tad.  I ordered the Chile Relleno with rice and beans.  For vegheads wondering if there is any type of meat product in the rice and beans, the woman who took my order assured me that they do not put any animal broth/stock in the rice and they do not cook the beans in pork/lard.  I was happy to hear that.  Okay, my critique of the food.  The rice wasn't bad and the beans were pretty good.  You can tell the food was cooked that day, which is something I really pay attention to.  Nothing tasted old or out of a can.  Now as for the Chile Relleno itself.  Good, but tough.  I'm not sure if they roast the poblano peppers first or not.  If they don't, they really should.  My knife and right arm were getting a work-out.  Also, there were several seeds in the pepper that should have been removed beforehand.  I nearly broke a tooth at one point.  Yeah, okay, okay, I'm over-exaggerating.    Is El Jalapeno better than other Mexican restaurants? Worse?  Hmmmm...good question.  It really does depend on your personal preference and taste I guess.  My personal preference is still El Pastor and Taqueria Guadalajara.  However, you should still try El Jalapeno if you are in the neighborhood or wanting to try something new instead of always going to Laredos.  (I have nothing against Laredos, honestly)  Why only 3 stars?  This is due to a tough poblano pepper that had only a small amount of cheese in it.  Was a bit small too.  Otherwise I would have given it 4 stars.  I will come back, for sure."}
{"text":"El Jalapeño is one of the only places in the Midwest that I can convince my Southern-California born wife to get Mexican food from. I personally love their variety of quality tacos, but can never go through the menu without a long look at a Gordita, because they're top notch. If I had to choose one item it'd be the steak and pork combination taco, but my wife would probably put their chicken at the top of her list. In all, love going here, now if only I could get myself to work off the extra calories I inevitably order!"}
{"text":"Gotta go with Liz B on this one... I just don't like it.   Much of this could be what I order, so I'll most certainly be back to try the things that folks here have raved about. But the positive reviews make me wonder if I'm missing something. The salsa is rough. Watery. Flavorless. I'd rather have Pace. And the chicken fajitas have no flavor. I don't understand! Throw meat onto a screaming hot skillet and your certain to build up a nice crust on the the outside. But nada. The rice and beans follow suit. Bland and boring. Again, maybe I'm not ordering the right things?"}
{"text":"Carnitas are very good on the Saturday/Sunday. The Suizo Burrito was very good and LARGE. The Gordidas were were good as well. Went in after opening on Sunday - was able to seat 8 with no problem. A birthday lady said the margarita was very good as well."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away and not super accessible, but be ready for some super tasty Authentic Mexican Fare. The salsa is fresh and spicy , the chips thin and warm. Together they make a great snack. You will need it because the wonderful aroma of grilled steak and chicken fills the place and makes you hungrier!       I had the shrimp quesadilla and was pleasantly surprised at how full and flavorful it was. Loaded with fresh ingredients and it was on my table just minutes after we placed our order. We also had the queso dip (a must if you have kids) and it was the highlight of supper for my daughter!  They are very  fast for getting your order to you.       Don't call ahead an order, it literally is faster than fast food of you order to go when you get there. I have waited longer at Taco Bell every time than here!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not all that great either. Based on previous reviews, I get the sense that Wisconsinites have no idea of what good Mexican food tastes like (probably because most of the Mexican restaurants here suck).  Cheap prices, sure. Flavorful food, no way.  Everything was very bland. Salsa tasted like they opened a can of diced tomatoes and put it in a bowl. Meat in the tacos was under-seasoned. Most food was bland with no flavor. Even the guacamole. When you make guacamole, you need to *at least* add salt and lime (if not add pico de gallo). Tasted like mashed avocado on a plate, no more. Margaritas were good and cheap during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! I recommend the tacos pescados muy bueno.   Don't know why I have never heard good things but this is a hidden treasure in madison. Donde esta Los tacos vatos"}
{"text":"My daugther and son went to eat yesterday sat 21 of march and they ate tacos of bistec and they got very sick, really sick We will talk to the city about this as they are very bad sick vomit, diarrea  and alot of pain unable to get up today from bed. We will never go back again to this place.  Mi hija e hijo fueron a comprar ayer unos tacos de bistec y ambos cayeron muy muy enfermos a caysa de esos tacos, ambos tiene mucho dolor y vomito y diarrea, no pudieron levantarse hoy de la cama, lo camos a reportar a la ciudad ya q estan realmente enfermos. Jamas vveremos a este restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is not so great. I was pleased to see the colorful engraved chairs and tables, which was a decor improvement compared to the previous restaurant in this location. But the food was disappointing. I'm not sure what made the salsa inferior, either,maybe an excessive tomato juice flavor. You also only get 1 basket of chips per table, each additional is an additional cost. The refried beans probably were the most interesting part of the meal, as they seemed to have an earthy flavor. Meats lacked flavor.  Not planning to return, I will go to other Mexican restaurants I know are better."}
{"text":"Awesome and delicious food, and very reasonably priced. The decor on the inside is colorful and fun, great for families. My only concern is that after we were served our food, it was difficult to get the waitress's attention. We had to ask for a drink refill and was not told until waiting for quite awhile that our check had been waiting for us at the counter. Kind of a weird experience, but I guess now we know. We will be going back since the food was spot on. :)"}
{"text":"Eehh. With a name like Taqueria Jalapeño, I should have guessed that they would have standard barely passable Mexican food.    The decor was garish, the tables were sticky, and I left feeling underwhelmed. I had taquitos with rice and beans.  The rice had more corn in it than rice, and the beans were bland. The taquitos were okay.  A little too greasy,  not really flavorful.   As someone who grew up only going out to eat at restaurants on 2nd and National in Milwaukee,  I feel like I'm a decent judge of Mexican food.  I won't be coming back.  I know there are better beans and rice to be found in Madison!"}
{"text":"This unassuming strip mall restaurant has fast, delicious authentic Mexican food. You know it's authentic when spoken English is the minority language.   I love that there's plenty of close and free parking.  Also love that they automatically serve you complimentary house-made chips and salsa. And the chips are great!  We went on a Saturday for lunch. Yay, no waiting for a booth or table. The decor is very brilliant and fun.  Our server was lightning fast and accurate. She easily took care of ALL tables with a smile, can't beat the service.  We both had one of the Lunch specials: Small burrito with a side of beans and rice. I like that their burritos DO NOT automatically contain rice. The flour tortilla was nicely browned and the steak filling was delicious!   We both kept saying \"this is soooo good.\" Even the beans and rice were very tasty.   I splurged and enjoyed a bottle of real-sugar Mexican Coke. It was like the  cherry on a wonderful lunch sundae! Mmmmmm  They take plastic, but make it blatantly clear that cash is preferred. Small price to pay, people."}
{"text":"Eat here!!!!!!!!!  My favorite traditional Mexican in Madison!  I love the gorditas, the fresh corn tortilla is soft on the inside but light crispy texture on then outside.   I usually get the pastor but other options have all been consistent!  Hot sauce in the big bottle is wonderful and guacamole is so fresh!     It's very family friendly, service is super quick and everyone has been warm and inviting!"}
{"text":"El Jalapeno is a great upgrade from the previous establishment and I'm glad to see another very good authentic Mexican restaurant in Madison.  Prices are completely reasonable, salsa is quite tasty, and the food is right on par with Taqueria Guadalajara in my opinion.  What's really surprising is that this isn't a hole in the wall once you actually walk into the place despite how the former establishment was and how the outside of complex looks.  They have some TVs, a colorful atmosphere, a good amount of seating, and very friendly staff.  Their gorditas are the go-to favorite for both my wife and I, and their tacos and chimichangas are also top notch.  Madison is very hit or miss with Mexican from what I've experienced (and I've tried a decent amount of places on both sides of town), so make sure to get to El Jalapeno if you're a fan of food from south of the border.  It's not the best I've ever had, but it's right on par with the best of Madison."}
{"text":"Mmmmm lovely tacos!!!!! Fresh with lime, chopped onion,  and cilantro. Husband loves the lengua, and I love the pork. Wished we lived closer and we'd be here much more often.  Need to try the menudo on the weekends."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Mexican Food.   Not a lot of choices in Madison, but found this on Yelp.    As stated in other reviews, lots of construction in the area so the best way to enter the strip mall parking lot is by heading southbound on Midvale to the restaurant.  The restaurant is on the west side of the street.  Service was excellent, not overbearing, very down to earth.  Food came extremely fast and was very fresh and authentic to me.  The flour tortillas on the tacos tasted like they were made seconds before they placed the meat on the taco.  The chips were delicious.  Reasonable prices and excellent service.  Definitely want to head back soon."}
