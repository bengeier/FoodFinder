{"text":"Excited to dine here tonight. Atmosphere was pleasant. Not too loud. Nice background music and even live music tonight. Staff was awesome, cared about our experience checked in but not to much so we were not unduly interrupted. Food was wonderful. Mac and cheese dish is creamy and delicious. Pork dish was cooked to perfection. Sandwich wrap had a really nice flavor. Crab cakes were very good. Parmesan garlic fries ( clearly listed on the menu) were really good. Guacamole appetizer was really great and chips were fresh and crispy. Flourless brownie was really good too. We will certainly come here again."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for making our anniversary very special. The staff was so amazing, and our waitress took extremely good care of us. The food...words can't describe how phenomenal. We loved every bite and are looking forward to going back again and again."}
{"text":"Went there after reading all of the great reviews and have to say they were true! We really enjoyed our meal, the service was excellent and we felt very welcomed by the staff. The menu has a good variety although some of the items seemed to be more for wintertime than summer. Everything we ordered was fresh, well prepared and tasted great. There is a great need for an upscale restaurant in our area and this one is worth going to! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Incredible grits, the best I've ever had.  Our waitress, Cheyenne was very friendly and helpful.  Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"You guys have to try this place! Every bite my family ate was delicious. Husband had Mac and cheese with chicken and mushroom. It was incredible. I had the wedge salad which was huge and so tasty. Kids had burger and pizza which both loved. Went back with a friend today for lunch and had grilled Caesar salad which was so fantastic. Also, tomato soup is not to be missed! Service was quick and attentive. This is a hidden gem! Union county people! All people! Must go!"}
{"text":"We went twice this week as we had a generous gift card to use up before we move. Both times the food and service was great. Today we both had the Saveeda Burger medium rare- excellent. It is hard to find a great burger with garlic fries that is thick, juicy, and fresh for under $10! Our server Stephen I believe his name was- prompt professional and attentive. Will definitely return when we visit family!!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic!!  Crab cakes are my favorite.  A must try in Waxhaw/Wesley Chapel."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in Wesley Chapel. The food, drinks, atmosphere and service are all excellent. We had the scallops with risotto and they were as good as anywhere- perfectly cooked and the presentation was beautiful. The kitchen serves a nice crème brulee too. The cocktails are very imaginative, and they have cocktail deals on Tuesdays. The servers are knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. This place gets everything right. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch on the patio on a Thursday afternoon. Had the patio to myself, and worked on my laptop for about an hour and a half. The roasted beet salad add salmon was wonderful and I took advantage of the half-price bottle of wine (don't tell anyone). Wait staff was attentive, but not overly so, just right for someone trying to get some work done. I hope to return for one of their monthly wine dinners."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!   We were on our way to Firebirds, but stumbled across Saveeda's.  And glad we did.  Best crab cakes I've had- real chunky crab meat, grilled to perfection.  Followed by a delectable wedge salad, then had a grilled 12 oz ribeye that satisfied my every craving for red meat.  My wife had the osobuco - tender and rich meat complimented by a tasty reduction sauce.  Service was excellent and the owner (Lincoln) was very friendly."}
{"text":"We decided to try Saveeda's based on other Yelper's reviews. I'm am so glad we did! They have a wonderful menu offering many varied dishes. We started with the warm pimento cheese, and we all agreed that it was delicious. Very creamy, and offered with pita points and celery. Hmmm, maybe they would offer a variation of a buffalo chicken cheese dip?   For entrees, one had the strip steak mid-rare. It had a nice flavor and was enjoyed thoroughly. I had the osso bucco. Very tender, and the gravy was delicious. As for a child offering, the little one had the alfredo noodles and added chicken. That also was very delicious.   Dessert was the creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake with ice cream. So good!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I just can't stop saying enough about our new found favorite restaurant !!!  The food is amazingly delicious, the staff and service was impeccable, the atmosphere was charming.....and prices are reasonable!!!!  This is a true gem, right here in Wesley Chapel.......lots of gluten free options, as well!!  Love it!!"}
{"text":"Went there Friday night for the first time. The grilled Caesar was unique and very good. My wife had the salmon and love it.  My only complaint was the price of the special that I ordered. It was a salad with tuna and they charged $25. I guess it was my fault not to ask the price but the most expensive salad with a tuna add on would have been 16.95. The salad was basic and had nothing in it to justify that price. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am in love! We tried this place for lunch yesterday after reading the reviews, and I could not have been more pleased! I had the tomato bisque and (grilled) ceasar salad and they were both simply fantastic. My husband indulged a bit more with the chicken mac-and-cheese and he said it was one of the best pasta dishes he's had in a long while. We sat at the bar and sincerely enjoyed the wonderful ambiance (not too big, not too small), the fantastic beer and wine selection, and the hospitable owner/operator and wait staff. We will definitely be back for more meals!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch with my family today. Our server, Steven, was excellent! He recommended that I try the chef's featured special of the day, and I am so glad I tried it! It was a Filet Mignon flatbread with grilled onions, broccoli, filet seared medium rare served with a side of horseradish sauce for dipping! It was delicious. The portion size was also perfect, not too big but not too small either. I felt perfectly full after."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we were very impressed. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was relaxing. We had the shrimp bruschetta and pimento cheese dip and they were excellent. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"It's been a few months since we've been here.  It was fantastic!  Past experiences were good too... but it's gotten even better!   Food and service were perfect!  Party of six... filet special, crab cakes, osso bucco, chicken rosemary, flatbread pizza and a burger.   All wonderful!  Thursday is 1/2 price on bottles of wine which was a pleasant surprise!  Well done Saveeda's!"}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of restaurant reviews (this is the first one on Yelp, in fact!), but felt compelled to get something out there about how impressed my family and I were with Saveeda's Bistro, particularly since we were among their first customers.  Saveeda's is located at the end of the Harris Teeter shopping complex, in the old Villa Mia location. Saveeda's hits a sweet spot in the Wesley Chapel - Weddington area, providing a casual but slightly upscale American cuisine dining experience.  The dining area is small but comfortable, well-planned, and tastefully decorated.  I'd be equally comfortable bringing my family of four, with two young children, or just having a date night with the wife (although I might show up a bit later in the evening in the latter case).  They also had a nice looking patio area, with gas flame patio heaters. We were inside tonight. The menu is reasonably sized, not overwhelming, with a nice selection of American options.  If a bit on the pricey side, I found that to be a reflection of the quality, and for that reason I felt that the prices were fair and reasonable.  If you're looking for cheap burgers, this isn't that type of American.  Still, our family of four ate very well, with a nice bottle of value wine, for just over $100, pre-tip.  I can't complain.  You'll find seafood, beef, pasta and sandwich options, from what I remember. The wine list was a bit on the smallish side, but varied and refreshingly different, with some real gems and a good range of red and white varietals representing several geographies and taste profiles.  You can tell that it was thoughtfully selected; my compliments to the sommelier.  Check out the \"Bottle Features\" board for some great value wines not listed on the menu.  There were also martini options and a small selection of craft beers that I noticed, but I'm a cork dork, so don't have much to add there. For an appetizer, we enjoyed the Margherita Flatbread immensely.  For the entrée, my wife had a Vegetable Ratatouille, which you don't see often.  It was very flavorful, a comforting meal.  My oldest son had crabcakes that melted in your mouth.  Loaded with crab, seasoned perfectly in my opinion, with the right amount of heat. My younger son had a hamburger (perfect temperature) with a generous portion of fries.  I had an outstanding grilled salmon, also cooked to the perfect temperature (medium rare in my case).  I was most impressed with the sweet potato accompaniment, which complemented the salmon very well.  I might suggest that they add a children's menu, but the adult hamburger seemed to suit my 10 year old just fine.  I will say that the coleslaw that came with the crabcakes was incredible (and I hate coleslaw).  I could have had a pound of that as my main course and been happy. My wife and I sampled every meal on the table, and were equally impressed by all of them, even the basic burger.  It would be tough to say which was best (although I stand by my coleslaw statement). Service was outstanding.  Nothing much to say there other than it was what you should expect from all good restaurants:  knowledgeable server; timely table visits; sufficiently friendly and chatty but respectful of guests' time and table conversations. In summary, my family and I loved it, and are already looking forward to a return visit.  I also look forward to visiting the bar area, which looked comfortable and welcoming, but that will be for date night."}
{"text":"We go at least twice a month and have yet to be disappointed. I've had the big hitters on the menu with the exception of the filet and all are amazing. Definitely recommend the Chicken Mac and Cheese or Crab Cakes as your first plate here. The pimento cheese dip is insane and all of the cocktails are hand crafted and delicious. I would recommend reservations to be safe as the waiting area is a bit small. But go for it and support local business!"}
{"text":"This was my second time there, the first time I had the Crab cakes which were pure lump crab meat, no bread crumbs whatsoever! It was very delicious. It came with the miso honey coleslaw, which I could eat a bowlful of. Tonight I had the Pork Ossobuco which was excellent. It was ridiculously tender and placed over a bed of polenta! Also I had the seared tuna and avocado appetizer and it was perfect.   The bar selection is great. They rotate 3 different beers on tap and have an excellent choice of bottled beers. Although I haven't tried the cocktails, it seems the bartender has a great deal of expertise. All those drinking around me had full confidence in her ability to create the perfect drink. I think this will be a go to spot for me."}
{"text":"After seeing a couple of reviews on this place the family and I decided to go out for dinner tonight local and this was a bookmarked establishment so off we went. At first glance the place is quant and appealing as well as cozy. The greeter who may be the manager of owner was very welcoming and friendly. He even came over to our table during dinner to inquire about our meal to see if we were enjoying and happy thus far.  The food this go round was OKAY, the best item on the table was what I ordered which was something that is no longer on the menu but I saw it on Yelp (Ahi Tuna with avocado and peanut slaw) so the waitress informed me that they would make it. The other best item was the asparagus which was my son side as he had the child grilled cheese with asparagus. My husband had the steak and cheese with a side of sweet potato fries and my teenager had a burger and fries. They both were not extremely impressed with their choices but agreed that they would like to come back and try something else.  I forgot to mention that we also shared the pico guac which was underwhelming as well I had to add salt and squeeze lime into it to make it taste like something worth eating.  The staff, ambiance and service was good. The wait was ridiculous seeing as how the place wasn't packed, but I'll take it that they were working on perfecting our dishes. Every place deserves a second try and that we will do as they have BYOB Monday's per the signage."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse.  Top quality meat.  Great service and very fresh salads.  Good appetizers and great selection wines and beers.  Owner operated so hands on operation.  I highly recommend give yourself a real treat.  Great deserts."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how the reviews are so good. My husband and I have eaten here twice and the food is not that good. It's convenient to have a restaurant  in that area, aside from fast food, but the food is subpar at best. If you're not a picky eater, like a ton of salt and rosemary, and are ok with your flavors running together, this is your spot. We haven't returned and we don't miss it at all."}
{"text":"First experience here was for New Years Eve dinner. The service was outstanding and most of the courses of the predetermined four course meal were phenomenal. The main course was filet mignon with grilled asparagus and scalloped potatoes. The potatoes were undercooked but otherwise everything was really delicious. I will definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"Loved the unexpected taste and food that came out ..this place is awesome and so unexpected ..brought the family here and we left with some amazing taste buds being jacked !!!"}
{"text":"Everyone is warm, welcoming and friendly. It's a nice atmosphere. Thank you Kami! Your a gem"}
{"text":"The food was very fresh... the mac and cheese is to die for. The space is small buy worth a try ."}
{"text":"So excited to finally find a local restaurant that offers great food and cocktails at reasonable prices. This is a hidden gem tucked away in Wesley Chapel. What an unexpected delight plus they serve lunch til 4pm!!! Can't wait to return for another wonderful culinary experience."}
{"text":"We finally went to Saveedas for dinner recently and had an excellent experience. The food, service, and cocktails were all very good!   We decided to skip appetizers & jump right into salads. Hubby got his usual which is caeser and I ordered thr wedge (minus the bacon).   For my entrée, I got the grilled chicken & mushroom pimento Mac & cheese. This was delish and a good portion size, enough for leftover lunch the next day!  Hubs got the crab cakes & said they were good.  For dessert we got the flour less truffle cake with salted caramel ice cream. Delish!  We were there on a night when they had cocktails on special, so we each had a couple of drinks. I had the Moscow Mule and Pama-Cosmo and hubby had the Dark & Stormy and Tropical Breeze.   We enjoyed everything and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food, pleasant atmosphere, & good value.  We were greeted & seated by the owner.  Although we we there in between regular meal times, 2 servers took care of us.  They were both so nice & personable.  My friend had the salmon, & I had the crab cakes - both were very good.  I indulged in the bourbon chocolate pecan pie afterwards - Yum!  We're back again (4-2018) for the 5th time.  Great again!  We ordered the crab cake dinner & vegetable ratatouille.  Best crab cakes ever, no filler!  We really wanted to try one of the homemade desserts, but unfortunately a woman sitting near me over-applied perfume.  I mentioned it to a manager who quickly offered to move us, but I declined.  The service is always on point.  I saw Ossobucco nearby that I can't wait to try next time."}
{"text":"The best time to go is brunch. They have the best French toast I have ever had, hands down. But don't let that hold you back from trying everything else. All their dishes are excellent! My family frequents Saveedas at least once a week and theirs no getting sick of it!"}
{"text":"It is nice to have a nicer restaurant nearby and Saveeda's fills this niche nicely.  My husband and I dined there for dinner.  I ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes entree and was delighted to see that the crab cakes were actually crab -- not a bunch of seasoned stuffing!  They were very tasty and the accompanying Miso Slaw was delicious, very unique.  The Parmesan-Garlic Fries were also a nice addition to the meal.  My husband ordered the Grilled Atlantic Salmon, which was actually pretty standard, but the side of green beans made the meal for him.  They are a garlic lover's delight!  It also came with a Leek Bread Pudding which added interest to his meal.  I don't think we'd ever had a savory bread pudding, but we enjoyed it!    The price is a bit higher than we typically pay for dinner out, but for a nicer evening it was worth it."}
{"text":"Went tonight and ordered an absolute and cranberry twice.....got charged 2 doubles.  Bartender second night.....when questioned she said that's how it rings up even for singles,  chalking this up to being new,but seemed shady.  The chicken was dry, but they quickly replaced.  Grilled cheese and bacon sandwich was good.  The mushroom bruschetta was divine.  I may try this place again and will order beer or a bottle of wine and hope I am not overcharged."}
{"text":"Been here since July. This is the first place that I really enjoyed and felt like I was back in Brooklyn, NY.  I plan to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Visited while in town on business.  Excellent food and exceptional customer service.  Our waitress was very attentive and the manager frequently came to check on our table to make sure we had everything we needed.  I would definitely go back when back in the area."}
{"text":"This is such a great place. Never had a bad meal here after quite a few now. Really good atmosphere, wait staff are nice and very good. Food is top notch and priced reasonably. Very good wine and fair beer selections."}
{"text":"We had the pimento cheese with pita chips (very good - 4*), 7oz filets (excellent - 4*), mac and cheese (awesome - 5*), and mashed potatoes (very good - 3.5*). Service was excellent and accommodating. Very impressed for such a small place to have such a wonderful ambiance and such good food. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried our newest Wesley Chapel restaurant for lunch...the grilled cheese, tomato, and bacon sandwich was awesome; but the Mac and Cheese was even better. By the way...the garlic Parmesan fries (as clearly stated on the menu) were incredible...if you don't prefer them you should probably try McDonalds across the street...  We will definitely be returning. Great food, great atmosphere, good wine list, full bar...what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Great place. Owner seems to be a great guy. Had the mac and cheese and it was amazing.  Friend had grilled cheese and tomato soup, she said it was wonderful. Someone stated on another review that they didn't like the garlic parm fries, I loved them. Guess a matter of taste.  Good prices on wine and food is reasonable.  Free corkage on Monday night."}
{"text":"Our second visit and again outstanding! Crab cakes are exceptional (no bread crumbs!) . Saveedas salad is excellent. Wines are great. They gave us free desserts for our birthday (yummy chocolate dessert topped by ice cream) Service exceptional."}
{"text":"Went there a couple months ago.   They did a really nice job on the inside make over.   Has a higher end feel.   Service was great and the food was pretty good.  The owners in laws where greeting and seating people.  The owner is also the chef.   I was told he was out that day.   Ordered the scallops as a starter and they were a rubbery and over cooked.   My girl got the crab cakes and they were good.  I got the Philly cheese steak and it was ok.  I am from Philly so I am very picky.  So maybe they were off when I was there since the main cook was out...so I will give them another shot."}
{"text":"The place feels like a dressed up pizza parlor, probably because that is what it was before the ownership change. The wild mushroom brushetta appetizer was good, flat breads were also good. The Crème Brulee was delicious. Very attentive service and the owner, Lincoln, was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"What an excellent steakhouse and perfect little hidden gem!  Saw the reviews and decided to stop in and try this restaurant.  Got the filet and it was excellently prepared and the sides were very delicious!  The delicious Creme Brûlée for dessert certainly solidified this restaurant as a new family favorite for us."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant in Wesley Chapel. I have been here for dinner and brunch on multiple occasions. The restaurant is kid-friendly and even has a nice patio area for outdoor dining. I am originally from Maryland and am highly picky about crab cakes...the ones at Saveedas are awesome.....full of lump crab with no filler. The parmesan garlic fries are another favorite. Sign up for their frequent diner club for great offers on repeat visits."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, neighborhood favorite,familial staff, visible and friendly ownership. One of our favorite lunch-time restaurants."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch after hearing good things. Everyone was right, this place is awesome and fills a much needed niche in the Wesley Chapel food scene. The menu has delicious options for everyone and includes a ton of great gluten free options. I had the bacon tomato grilled cheese and garlic parm fries. They were both excellent, but the fries brought me back to San Francisco's best! I'll definitely be coming back, and if they decide to offer the only brunch in the area I'll definitely be a regular. Keep up the good work.   Also, I just happened to be there at the same time they received their sanitation rating. At a score of 99 it's the best I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Saveeda's this weekend. It was terrific. We were warmly greeted and promptly seated. The service and the food were excellent!  We will become regulars here I'm sure."}
{"text":"7/31/17 Another Great meal here today  Sunday they have a very  nice brunch menu along with regular menu  Even though I have not been here in a while Steven  remembers you name and what you usual drink He is very good  and professional This is one restaurant that I will go to as often as possible !!!!    Went for lunch this Wednesday and have a Great Hamburger cooked to perfection by Lincoln the owner and some great fries and Avery nice Stella draft beer Both servers are Excellent and and remember your name when you walk in This is a Great place to dine Will go back as often as I can"}
{"text":"We were excited to find a place so close to home but we were underwhelmed. The ambiance was very nice and our server was very nice and very attentive.  The food was only meh. I had the crab cakes which were great. The sides were bland and needed a lot of salt. My husbands steak sandwich was mostly bread but he loved the fries. My sister raves about the Parmesan Fries, too. Dessert was disappointing. The creme brûlée was dry and too eggy. The gf choc cake just wasn't any good, the ice cream and sauces couldn't even save it. I REALLY wanted to like it here.  It's too bad the food wasn't better because everything else was good."}
{"text":"The first time I came was for Sunday brunch which I came with a couple different girlfriends about a month ago.  It was slightly crowded, but not so crowded we felt ignored.  We sat on the lovely patio and the host automatically took care of us.  He opened up the umbrella, made sure the area was to our liking.  This place is classy!  I just enjoy having my coffee served on a nice little plate with a tiny metal creamer (as opposed to the bowl of plastic creamers).  I had the delicious goat cheese omelet and fresh pineapple.  It really didn't cost too much for the quality of food you get.  I came here a second time with my girlfriend this past Wednesday and you all did not disappoint. It wasn't too busy when we got their about 11:30, but filled up around noon.  The sever, Stephen (Steven) was very prompt, thoughtful and friendly.  I had the squash soup to start with...it was over-the-top delicious!!!  HAVE THE SQUASH SOUP!  I then had a salmon wrap with a miso-slaw.  I had enough to take home with me.  My girlfriend had the terrific macaroni and cheese.  Not your southern macaroni and cheese.  This was lighter, and dare I say gourmet?  I think it came to about $15.00 per person, again, not too bad for the quality of food.  I just wanted to add that my girlfriend and I chatted for a really, really long time and never did they give us the bums rush, Stephen just kept filling our water and occassionally answering any questions we have.  Just one more thing about Stephen, someone forgot their to go box and he rushed outside to find them to ensure they got  their left overs.    I will be back!!!  My mister wants to try that crab cake :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly.  Tuna, risotto very good.  Steak and cheese sandwich not good.  Hair found in sandwich.  Overall though okay.  If go back would have the tuna and risotto.  Wait staff was wonderful."}
{"text":"I had read the reviews and finally tried this great little gem last evening. The food was well seasoned and delicious! My husband had the fish special and I had the tuna which were both outstanding. The beet salad was delicious with both red and golden beets. We figured if everything was that good, the desserts must be too--chocolate cake--perfect ending to a delightful evening. The owner was chatty and kind as well as our terrific server. Well done and an A+"}
{"text":"My husband both loved our meal. I had the crab cakes, which was delicious. He had the mac n cheese, he loved it. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"A breath of fresh air for our area. If you like Hickory Tavern or local pizza house this place probably not for you. If you like great food . Yes I said great food and a nice atmosphere then you'll love this place. The crab cakes are to die for. Crab cakes without the breading yummy."}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE LOVE Saveeda's. We recently moved from the Phoenix area where there were amazing restaurants. Saveeda's is one of a kind with personal flare!!  They have amazing coffee and will accommodate most dishes to be gluten free. Great place with great staff!!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area, had noticed Saveeda's and thought it was worth a try. \"Meh\" is about the best word I can find to describe our experience. Our food was \"ok.\" My husband liked his crab cakes, but we both agreed that the garlic mashed potatoes had an odd \"lemony\" taste to them- I did not eat mine... but my filet was WAY overcooked. Ordinarily, I might have sent it back, especially for the price, but we had already waited more than 45 minutes to receive our food-in a VERY empty restaurant. We saw two other sets of customers come in, order, eat and leave before we ever got our food. No one ever offered an explanation other than when the waitress delivered the food and said, \"sorry for that little extra delay...\" Little? Extra? Is a delay normal? 45 minutes for regular menu items with no special requests in an empty restaurant is not acceptable. The waitress did not return to check on us after she delivered our food until she brought the check. Then she dropped off the check and disappeared. We were VERY ready to go, but couldn't find anyone to pay. Finally, after some staring and glaring, a different staff member came and took our credit card. It was not the worst restaurant experience we've ever had, but we've got enough new options to try that there's no need to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Such a charming place with great food and exceptional service!  Keep up the great work Saveedas!  We have lived in this area for years but just recently 'found' Seveeda's and couldn't be happier this is only minutes from our home.  Our first visit on a recent Friday night we had the owner come up to our table and check on us and had a great 'visit' in meeting him and hearing about his story and how Saveeda's was \"born\".  Second visit only a few evenings later was just as good.  The food, service, atmosphere - it's all WONDERFUL and I'm so happy we 'found' this gem and it's soooo close to home!  We will definitely be making this our local 'spot'!  You wont be disappointed in anything on the menu!!!! I can't wait to try it ALL!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. $5 Bloody Mary's and Mimosas. We order the Mimosas, very good. We tried the Bellini but it was disappointing.   Our party had chicken and waffles, nothing to write home about. Frozen tenders fried again and bland waffle. Omelets were good and potatoes and side of grits tasty. I had the rib eye sandwich. I was super excited even with the $14.95 price tag - pretty rich for lunch. Now this is what ruined my experience. The rib eye had tons of of little sharp and very hard bones. I kept biting down on hard bits and actually scratched my gum. I couldn't finish half of my half sandwich, I had to call the waiter over.   Now service was good but when I asked about my rib eye having so many little bones he said well it's a rib eye. Yea well duh but the bone is huge and not in shards. So I asked him to take it away, I couldn't eat it without breaking a tooth or worse. This red headed lady came over, maybe a manager? She was apologetic and said she would take it to the chef, asked if I wanted anything else but I was turned off and declined. She came back a few minutes and said that the chef apologized and that it must have been a bad batch of meat, there should never be bones like that and they would take it off the menu for the day and not be serving it again. She again asked if I would like something such as a house salad and I did take her up on the offer.   So this is what completely turned me off. This \"manager\" stated they were not serving the rib any longer and taking it off the menu. I watched the waiter 40 minutes later serve up a rib eye sandwich to a couple across from us. As we were leaving and I walked by I could plainly see it was the rib eye. I hate liars. I hope that man didn't break a tooth. The staff took the $14.95 off the bill but I'm not going back. Don't lie."}
{"text":"I'm ALWAYS skeptical when a restaurant - chain or local stalwart - adds a breakfast or brunch menu (I'm looking just across the parking lot at you, Chick-Fil-A).  BUT - Saveeda's delivers:  GREAT eggs benedict, French toast and omelettes.  Even the breakfast potatoes are perfect.  The kicker - not much more $ than the comparable items from Stacks farther south.  Add hash browns and a couple of skillets to the menu and you have it nailed.  For now, you have no reason to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Subpar brunch. My omelette was probably made with one and a half eggs. It looked so pitiful I couldn't photograph it. It was also greasy but I ate all of it. I was starving.   The highlight was the spider on the table. I killed it with the white tablecloth and proceeded to have the heebie jeebies until the check came.   It's a small, small restaurant. Seemed roomier for outdoor seating, which is where I would expect bugs. Not where I sat. Service was ok. I factor in that it was Easter and it was packed."}
{"text":"Food and service are always excellent!  My wife and I really enjoy having some great food that is locally owned.  In the times that I have been there, every time the meal has been top notch.  Thanks for coming to the area, look forward to many more great dining experiences!!"}
{"text":"You have to try the grilled salad. They grill the lettuce and tomatoes-good/smoky, not limp like your thinking.   Food was good, had the crab cakes-ok and the chicken-outstanding. Came back with my son another time and he had the mac ' n cheese-good.   The second time we came it was cold outside and every time the door opened, which was pretty often, we froze. I recommend siting far away from door-maybe the same thing happens with hot air and air conditioning too.   Casual dress, parking lot"}
{"text":"Been waiting to go to Saveeda's for a while since I live in the area and see this place all the time.  Finally went for Sunday brunch.  I was pleasantly surprised.  A quite cozy place.  The staff was very friendly, brought drinks and took our order.  I got the two for.  Salad and soup.  I must say I wanted to lick the bowl of yummy, creamy, delicious tomato bisque soup.  My husband got an omelet with grits.  Totally delicious.  Omelet perfectly cooked and \"they know how to cook grits\".  The portions are not very big, but very satisfying.  I will be back to try dinner."}
{"text":"Just the kind of restaurant this area needed!  The restaurant is on the smaller side, with a very intimate feel and the staff really makes you feel welcomed from the moment you step in. They all go out of their way to get to know you and make sure you are well taken care of.  The chef also came out to introduce himself-which I always love.   I find this kind of service lacking here and was thrilled that I followed the advice of other yelpers and checked out Saveeda's.   We had salads, seafood, and flatbreads-all fresh and delicious! Our waiter, Steven, had us laughing throughout our dinner.   They have a full bar but Mondays are BYOB with no corkage fee.  What?? I've never even seen that done. Guess where I'll be next Monday..."}
{"text":"What a great find!  We found this restaurant based on yelp reviews and it was excellent!  We had the wild mushroom bruschetta to start, with the lemon rosemary chicken and salmon for dinner .  Everything was cooked perfectly and the service was excellent .  We will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Wesley Chapel has needed a nicer dining option, and this place not only nailed the atmosphere, which is classy but not over the top, but they slammed the food out of the park.  Scallops are amazing, always cooked perfectly.  Fish has been perfectly seasoned and prepared.  Coming from Maryland we were hesitant to order crab cakes, but they actually don't ruin theirs with filling, it's just a good lump crab cake!  Awesome job on brunch too!  Keep up the good food.    Update - went for brunch last sunday - and it was awesome again!"}
{"text":"I live in Charlotte and travel 30 minutes just to eat their delicious food. One-of-a-kind dishes coupled with excellent service and reasonable prices. Make no mistake this place is a find."}
{"text":"Great little spot in the Harris Teeter center. They have a good wine selection and make a good Moscow Mule. Their food is great too. Great selection at a good price. Their grilled Caesar salad is super yummy!"}
{"text":"We had a spontaneous light lunch of tomato basil soup and salad. It was delicious and very nicely served.  The menu looked terrific and I do hope to go back.  The Sunday brunch looks very tempting!"}
