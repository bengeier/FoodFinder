{"text":"I'm not sure what the lines out the door or the totally packed dining room were about...but I I wasn't blown away. It was ok - nothing special and not the best hakka place out there either. The chicken pakoras were really good but everything else was greasy, salty and then greasy again."}
{"text":"So far the yummiest hakka chinese experience. I could not go wrong with any choice of items on menu. Slightly pricey. not giving enough credit because they are in business long enough to valie client care. Did not like their staff being rude to clients at another table. Patience is the first thing staff should learn."}
{"text":"Food *** - Service *** - Ambience ***

Fairly mediocre food. No matter what dish you order, it all tastes nearly the same. 
but fantastic portion sizes. We always have left overs. 

Recommended when you dont have a better choice. lol"}
{"text":"Good ole Eddie's. Food is great and at a reasonable price. I just wish they'd expand and offer more seating. Their decor is nice but I hate how cramped it is inside."}
{"text":"I got the lunch special for less than $9 which includes a soup, main dish with plain rice and one spring roll. This is a really good deal and there is more than enough food to have left overs. 

I ordered the General Tao Chicken and plain rice and it was really good. Although the food was good I did not like the service at this restaurant. The server did not immediately come to our table and we had to call him over. The table did not have enough napkins as my table had three people, we had to go to the other empty table to get napkins. The restaurant was very busy for lunch but luckily the food came out fairly quickly. 

Overall the food is worth it but the service is not exceptional."}
{"text":"A repeat order for my extended family when we crave hakka. 

Highly recommended:
- Chicken lollypop (spicy) for appetizer
- Chilli Beef
- Egg fried rice
- Soups
- Manchurian shrimp
- Crispy beef

Really really good food but you'll know that right away from the line-ups"}
{"text":"Loved the veg fried rice and chilli chicken.
Chicken pakoras are good too!
Waiting time is bit high, so if you are planning to eat here - do an early dinner."}
{"text":"The constant complaints of long wait times is not indicative of the food quality, which is absolutely superb. The best thing is to just do take out. They have always had the food ready In time. 
The food has always been consistently good and fresh. My favorite dish is Gen. Tao's chicken and sweet and sour manchurian. 
Must try!"}
{"text":"My Chinese friends would probably grimace at this place's 'authenticity', but there is no denying the version of Asian food these indo-pak chefs concoct is delicious. The sizzlers will knock your socks off. My only complaints include the less than sufficient amount of rice that comes with each dish; it is incredibly disproportionate with the dish itself. Additionally, seating is a wee-bit tight, but the food makes up for that tbh"}
{"text":"These guys don't care Coz they are busy every day, but it doesn't give them the right to treat customers as useless piece of shit. We pay for food and service. Can we get discount on the service you provide? Every occasion I've gone have to wait for 45 minutes funny thing is they don't even take reservation but expect us to wait. Next time i ordered take out gave them one hour to prepare my food and went to pick it up took them another 45 minutes to give me my order. My review is not going to make them change their ways as there are many customer in that community  who like to be treated this bad and still go for their food. Hopefully new customers will not follow the regular customers but I am never going back to them just to get treated badly."}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Terrible food. I don't know what's changed but they're quality has really gone down over the years. This is not the same Eddies we fell in love with the first time. Never coming back after this experience there are much better hakka options out there.. 

Soup was really watery and bland. Chicken pakoras were undercooked and crispy beef was over battered and tasted like candy."}
{"text":"Just here with family after a long day. Firstly it'd really busy and they don't have enough staff. I feel like they have added more tables but not staff.
None of the servers are smiling and look exhausted. I feel for them. Everything is taking time. Sat for 20 minutes and nobody came for the order. Had to flag one of them down.

Food quality is good, no complaints there. We came here for the full experience.

2 stars just for the food. Zero for service."}
{"text":"This place is extremely busy on weekends.  I find its best to call-in your order, pick-up, and enjoy in the comfort of home.  The food variety whether Szechuan, Chili, or Manchurian, all taste pretty much alike.  Hakka chow mein noodles are way too oily.  A couple of standouts are the chicken pakoras and the curry chicken spring rolls."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite Hakka Chinese restaurant.. I mostly do take out on alternative weekends. But this place is THE BEST in town for Hakka Chinese. 
Try their Manchurian Veg Noodles, Schezwan Chicken and chicken fritters.. just awesome!"}
{"text":"We were here about three years ago and had an amazing time. I have to seriously wonder if there's new management as this place has really gone downhill. 

Our table was sticky (even though it was wiped down) and our plates had food particles on them. We had to get new ones. 

There is a thick layer of dust in the dining area. The whole place could use a good scrubbing. 

The food took forever to arrive. The taste just wasn't great. It was drowning in sauce. It had a lot of oil & fillers in it. Food in a food court is better. 
 
My husband and daughter insisted that I give a review. My daughter has a good appetite and was starving when we got there but was only able to eat a few bites. 

If you've read this far it's correct to assume we didn't order dessert."}
{"text":"My Pakistani friend brought me here on December 27, and said you will love it.  We do not have anything like this in Windsor.  I had the Karachi chicken and szechuan beef.  I also tried his veggie soup.  All were really good.  I was able to handle the heat from both plates.  I loved the blend of thai and indian.  We waited 35 minutes to be seated but they let you order while you are waiting for seats which is really good if you are in a hurry. It is not 5 star because I felt that plates had too much sauce in both of them."}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple.
Their food is AMAZING.

Things I recommend :

Butter chicken [MY favourite]
Manchurian Chicken
Chili Chicken/fish
Hot and sour soup
Sweet and sour Manchurian beef. 

Small critiques?

Their spring rolls are kinda small and their staff is nice but not ALWAYS nice, however, that is made up in the quality of food. They are a bit pricey but its because they know their food is good. Their lunch specials however?? Great serving for the price.

I always find it absolutely necessary to take out of towners here because I know it'll be the best hakka they've had."}
{"text":"Best hakka Chinese food. Nothing else beats.  Chicken pakoras,  hot n sour soup,  chicken corn soup,  general taos chicken,  manchurian sweet n sour chicken, hakka chow mein,  boneless tandoori fish, tandoori fried rice, all are worth ordering. This place lives up to its hype"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place - a friend highly recommended this as the best place for hakka chinese food in Mississauga. Having lived outside of TO the past three years i was so deprived of good hakka food and was looking for something other than Federicks in Scarborough - i love their food but change is good, right? i dont think soo...

the Chicken Pakoras were generous for an appetizer plate - 12 pieces and they truly were fantastic and thats where the dining experence halted...

Mains: Chili Chicken - i dont think that was really chicken - its tough and dry and the suace wasn't that great.

Chicken Chow Mein - very very greasy - the husband makes way better chow mein that Eddie here does.

Ambience: it was a nice looking halal restuarant but was packed on a Saturday night at 8 pm. People were loitered around every corner of the restaurant and there were only parties of 8 and higher here. There were children running around everywhere banging spoons against plates and it was loud.

Service: we were quickly seated because we were only two but we were then neglected because there were larger parties that were being attended to. They take pre-orders as you arrive and are waiting to be seated - so study the menu beforehand because then as soon as you are seated they serve. we weren't given the pre-order option since we were just a party of two.

I wouldn't make the effort to drive to Mississauga to dine here again.

ps: it's Halal"}
{"text":"Probably the best Hakka food in the GTA! It's always busy because the food is good! Totally worth the wait... Their spicey squid is the BEST!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular Eddie's customer for many years. It is great Hakka/manchurian food. There are so many veggie options that you may actually have a hard time figuring out what to order. (To all the meat eaters: this is an unusual experience for vegetarians!)

I always start with the hot and sour or veg manchurian soup. The manchurian soup is great because it comes topped with crispy noodles adding a great amount of texture to the soup. This is a soup you chew, not slurp! 

My go to items include chilli paneer, vegetable Manchurian in gravy, and vegetable Manchurian chow mien. There's always plenty left over because the portions are huge! 

If you're in the neighbourhood around lunch time, definitely stop in for the lunch specials. There is no shortage of options to choose from and the portions are very generous! I personally found the quality of the lunch specials a little less than dinner or take our service. Maybe because they're super busy or they mass produce?! Not sure. But regardless, great value and delicious food! 

Now go eat!"}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be.

I really enjoy their Hot & Sour soup and their Chicken Chow Mein (even though there's not much chicken in it) but I find their other times have too much breading on them, and can only be eaten when hot/fresh. I've tried taking home leftovers and heating them up in the microwave, and it's barely edible then."}
{"text":"They seated us and then gave us five minutes to order. Harassed us to order right away so we left. Went to the haka restaurant down the street and ordered. 

But their food is amazing unfortunately so I will go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food & friendly staff. Service was also super fast. I recommend the chicken pakora, beef & mixed veg & Hakka chowmein (but skip the chicken in this dish-- it was dry). Maybe do a beef chowmein?"}
{"text":"I've been here several times before and always loved it, but the last few times I have noticed a drop in quality and cleanliness. The last time we were there, there were TWO hairs in our dishes (one in each). When we asked to talk to the manager, he sounded skeptical and suggested it was someone else's. How it got on a plate was a mystery, I suppose. We really didn't appreciate the suggestion that we had planted it there considering that we have been regular customers since this place opened. 

Eddies - get yourself together and go back to the way you were! There are other, better Hakka places and if you don't improve your cleanliness (at the very least!), you will lose your loyal clients."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the GTA.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is excellent.  I have been to this place more than 5 times and each time tasted different dishes which were all awesome.  I would recommend going to this place for lunch rather than dinner as it is over crowded and very noisy after 7pm. Did I mention that the staff are friendly and the service is very fast...?"}
{"text":"Wife's addicted to their food. Although, the quality of food can be a hit or miss, depending how rushed they are. 

I've had one instance where I found hair in my food but sadly the management did nothing to compensate for the experience. I chalked it up to waiter not being careful. None the less, I went back and do go back whenever wife is craving Hakka."}
{"text":"Great food. Long lines on the weekends though and the place can be slightly crammed. Food is way better than most hakka chinese places.."}
{"text":"A staple of middle class Mississauga. This place has been around forever, and it's definitely had its ups and downs.

Lately, my go to Hakka place has been Chilli Chicken House. What I've found is that CCH has now become wildly inconsistent due to its popularity. I have started visiting Eddies more and more and have found that;

1) The consistency is considerably better than CCH. 

2) The appetisers are better at Eddie's.

3) The quality of meat is better at CCH.

If you need a respite from CCH because of the insane crowds and wait times there, check out Eddie's (again)."}
{"text":"Chilli chicken pretty bombb. They over sauce things though. Ask to go light on the sauce. The crispy beef with sesame seeds is really good too. Lunch special is bang for your buck."}
{"text":"We(me and 3 friends) got take out last night. Ordered chicken lollipop, chicken schezwan fried rice, chicken Hakka noodles, paneer chilli and veg fried rice. Most of the food was okay to eat but it lacked the amount of spiciness and the Hakka style of food we were expecting. We have tried other places for Indo-Chinese food, this one just din't please our taste buds as much."}
{"text":"Food was good nothing too special. Service was horrible. We got seated with no menus, constantly had to ask for water and people were getting food before us who came after us"}
{"text":"This place was great. Ordered the chicken sweet corn soup, Bombay chicken, and tiger prawn in black bean sauce. The food was amazing, and the customer service was great."}
{"text":"I used to come here quite often, things aren't as great as they were.  I used to brag about this place. I don't know if their food has become more oily or what changed exactly. Still decent but not what it used to be :("}
{"text":"It's not the best but it gets the job done! I have been to the place for lunch quite a few times. 

The food is quite average but the pricing does the trick here. The food is quite cheap during lunch time and the portions are nice size. In the lunch special you get a soup, spring roll and a meat dish with rice, which is quite good.

The service is quite fast and their plenty of seating available.

For my fellow Muslims - This place serves halal meat."}
{"text":"LOOOOVEE eddie's!! Best Hakka food in town! It's also a family fave! Whenever my sister from Montreal visits, the family HAS to come here, it's a MUST! Just looking at the pictures is making my mouth water! The kids also seem to love it which is great! Sometimes they'll even ask for it!

We usually order:

Crispy beef
Veggie pakora (maybe a few billion orders)
Manchurian fried rice
Manchurian noodles
Hot and sour soup 
Wonton soup for the kids
And we always change it up with the chicken dishes , they're all amazing!

Also service isn't bad, they've always been quick and super nice! 

If you come for lunch during the week it's even better! Their lunch special/menu is super affordable and portion is a lot! 

Go and try it while I go wipe off my drool..."}
{"text":"By far the best Hakka in Mississauga hands down. Always packed so be sure to make reservations. Take out is, as good - if you want to avoid the lineups. Be sure to order the Chili chicken, & Manchurian Beef"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch takeout. Inside table that I sat was greasy. Staff were friendly. Love their chili chicken!"}
{"text":"Eddies is a restaurant that needs to improve their service and food. We came in with a party of 7 and were directed to the back of the restaurant(which was actually clean and good decor). From there it went downhill. Waited 10 minutes to be seated(in a spot that was available the whole time we were there). Once seated, we waited another 20 minutes to have our order taken. They were out of lollipop wings, regular wings, and some other dish which I cant recall. We ordered: fish pakora, chicken pakora, spicy noodles, fried rice, chilli chicken and mongolian beef. Oh and also chicken corn soup. Lets just say the only thing good was the soup, and believe me I'm the least pickiest eater you'll meet. The staff wasnt helping at all as they didnt acknowledge some of food was undercooked. I mean dont bring us more food or anything free but hey at least you can apologize out of courtesy. I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone, try hakka legend instead."}
{"text":"Always busy so it's best that you make reservations in advance, they're good an Manchurian chicken and general tao. Seating is a bit tight when it's busy"}
{"text":"The visit to this spot was a last minute decision and was prompted at the request of a friend's craving for Hakka Style Chinese food (Hakka from the Sub Continent). Someone had recommended this spot to her so we ventured all the way out to the suburbs to try this out. 
The place is located in a your run of mill shopping enclave with an almost nondescript exterior. Walking in one is taken aback by the kitsch complete with a water fountain in the centre of the restaurant. The place was packed with what seemed like a lot of repeat clients (a good sign)
On to the menu it covers all the bases associated with this style of food and then some surprises (Butter Masala Chicken anyone!!) I guess they can get away this as they do advertise themselves as fusion place.
On to the dishes we had the following
Chicken Manchurian (sweet and sour version), Fried Rice, Hot & Sour Soup, Sichuan style Egg plants, Crispy Sesame Beef and Kung Pao Chicken.
Now the major hitch was one of the diner asked them to hold back the spices!! 
Hakka cuisine without the spices is an oxymoron. Ah well.
Most of the mains come with a side of rice FYI.
Service was OK and we were checked on regularly.
Now for the main visually they look appealing but it just stops here. The Manchurian Chicken wasn't served on a sizzling platter (a signature for this dish) and with the spices held back could have been mystery meat. Kung Pao was close to a food court version. Egg plant fared a bit better. Egg fried rice was extremely oily. Crispy beef though appetizing when warm was almost un-edible after it got cooler (might as well have been called Jerky!) I guess being oily and heavy is a given with this variation of cuisine so almost everyone was bloated. I have a feeling that it would fare better if the spices were not held back (don't you hate when a diner spoils it for everyone) I can't recommend this place. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years but this was a downright opposite and a bad experience. Me and my friend ordered there lunch special (Manchurian chicken and Chilli beef) which can be only compared to dog food. The soup was cold, the fried rice were all mashed up and broken down and cold. The dish itself was dumped right alongside as if we are convicts at prison cafeteria. When I asked for the manager, she promptly walked over from another table that was also complaining about their food. On explaining how the food is really bad, she rolled her eyes and walked away without offering any solution. Rude management, bad food. Save your self respect and money and look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Mongolian beef and manchurian chicken must try! One of the best places I have been to in a long time prices are fair as well!"}
{"text":"I usually get fish or shrimp pakoras and chili chicken.  Pakoras are a pricier than most hakka places but taste very good.  Chili chicken is decent but not consistent.  They have a good lunch special that is less than $10 for a variety of choices.  I have been going to Tangerine more since they opened nearby.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner on a Monday night and we were seated fairly quickly. We ordered the chilli paneer gravy, veg fried rice, and spicy fried cauliflower. The food was delicious - particularly the spicy fried cauliflower! The chilli paneer gravy and the veg friend rice was decent - I've had better but it was good. The ambiance was casual. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Lollipop chicken was dry, way too sweet. Manchurian was gloopy in texture, and had enough garlic to kill a horse. Chilli chicken was comparable to licking your boots off after stepping in the mud and the price is as justified as the HST. HORRIBLE, Try it for yourself though maybe your tastes are different the place had a LINE OUT THE DOOR, so maybe it's just something I'm missing."}
{"text":"Actually a 2.5 because it was just too oily. The restaurant was nice and cozy, but the food was not that great. I'm not sure if it was just the dish I ordered, or the food in general.

Either way, I am reluctant on trying this place again, and am not sure if I would recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Eddie's is quite a good Hakka place. It's good enough that every once in a while, I'll grab a few friends and we'll make the pilgrimage to come out west from Toronto.

The food is good, the prices are good and the service is always very good. 

I've had the opportunity to try a good number of Hakka places around the city and Eddie's really is one of my top picks. 

If you live in Mississauga, then Eddie's should definitely be your go to Hakka joint. If you live in Toronto, I'd encourage you to make the trip to try this place out at least once before forming your own opinion. :)"}
{"text":"I visited this place yesterday i must say that it is very busy. This is the first time buying food from there I was not recommended by anyone. Just simply went on yelp and read the reviews. As i always tell my husband if you don't try something how would you know what it tastes like. Well I have to say the food was great will definitely go back my kids enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The place is really traditional looking, lots of Asian decor, plants, lovely looking restaurant. 

The food is meh... I don't like pineapple, which was in a good number of dishes on their menu. I looooveed their crispy beef dish the first time I went. Very delicious, not too sweet. I ordered it for takeout and it wasn't so good. Very saucy, very sweet, not so crispy. 

Expect to wait a while if you're there during lunch as a group. It took us almost an hour and a half for a group of 11 from work from the time we sat down to leaving the restaurant. The ordering took a while, the food took a while because someone ordered from a dinner menu and not the lunch menu, the paying took the longest! You have to stand in a separate lineup to pay by close it or credit.

Not sure I have enough incentive to go back."}
{"text":"Severely over priced and the quality is sincerely lacking; there is little consistency in the kitchen and your meal will vary significantly based on who is cooking it."}
{"text":"Two words: Manchurian noodles. It came piping hot to our table. I could smell the amazing stir fry wok smell before even touching the dish. First bite was full of intense flavor. Smoky BBQ taste. We got ours with shrimp and chicken.  

What could be improved? Pay attention to your customers when they walk in. Also you guys should use larger sized shrimps."}
{"text":"Went near opening on a weekend so there wasn't any wait but it gets very crowded as the day progresses. They do not reserve. For 4 people we order 5 dishes. We had lots of leftovers so portions are good. Had a variety of chicken, chicken sizzler, shrimp rice, noodles (Hakka) and chilli beef. All the items were hot and tasty. I didn't enjoy the shrimp rice with red rice too much. It was a little bland. Definitely worth coming back."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with excellent food.
Loved their Chopsuey. Service was a bit slow but we were busy enjoying the food.
Highly recommend when in Mississauga area."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to Hakka Chinese restaurant, I was a loyal customer for years. Sadly, things have gone downhill here for the last 4 years. On my last visit, the food was covered in sludgy brown sauce and the food was just not that great. We had the chicken pakora, chicken Hakka noodles, general tao, Manchurian chicken and crispy beef, nothing stood out as being memorable. My visit to the bathroom sealed the deal. There was a horrible lingering stench which made sense once I got into the stall. A sign was posted to dispose of toilet paper in the garbage and not the toilet. No thanks, never coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious hakka food. We ordered sweet and sour chicken (our fav), beef chilli (pretty good), chowmein, szchewan chicken perfect blend of spices, tandoori rice and regular Chinese fried rice. The food was spot on delicious. Everything was up to the mark. Definitely a place to take family and friends or just regular cravings for hakka food. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I travel all the way from Toronto for one thing and one thing only - SHRIMP PAKORA!! the best i ever had."}
{"text":"Hakka Chinese dripping oil as if you are having an Indian curry. Extremely disappointed with the quality of food. The food is bland, undercooked, and hot n spicy means sweet to them. Disoriented flavours .."}
{"text":"Good food. Very average customer service. End up visiting for the food, but the average customer service keeps the visits minimal. Go there for the food - don't expect to be pampered."}
{"text":"Great food and good and fast service. Highly recommended. Busy on weekend nights so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Hakka cuisine. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it was great!

We shared Chicken Pakoras, Manchurian Chow Mein, and Crispy Sesame Beef. Everything was delicious! I agree with one other reviewer who said the side of rice received with an entree was weirdly disproportionate. The entrees were huge, the side of steamed rice was what I usually see as a serving for one person in other Asian restaurants. But because we were sharing a few options, it worked out OK. The waitress actually noted that the side of rice was kind of small to share, so they are definitely aware of it!

The restaurant was clean, the staff were friendly and efficient, the prices were decent (slightly high, but not overly so), and the quality of food was good."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant for minimum of 11 years and the food has gotten worst every time we visit. The last visit I rated it a three and now just 2 and I being generous. 11 years ago I in my mind this was a 5. 

The Manchurian Soup had almost no flavour, the Veggie Manchurian did not have a zing that a Manchurian dish normally has. The Paneer Fried Rice had lots of Paneer, but the entire dish has been cut in half from the last time we were here. 

The Mixed Veggie in Chilli Sauce was a shocker. We expected it to have Chili spice and high on flavour-guess what? It had nothing, no chillies, no spice and it tasted a bit Sour rather than the spice. 

The plain rice given with the two dishes come in a tiny tiny bowl."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a 30 min wait and it will be worth it. This place has the best Indian-Chinese food. Very full menu, lots of options for vegetarians. Try the eggplant and any of the tandoori chicken variants. Spice levels are adjusted so good for kids as well. The noodles are done just right. End the meal with a mango lassi. Best part is the plating - food looks delicious as served. And talking of service, it's excellent. Very well managed place for the kind of volume it handles. Your order is taken outside even as you wait for a table, an interesting way to make the overall wait shorter. Highly recommend this!"}
{"text":"Let's just put it this way I drove from toronto to missisauga during rush hour so my drive back was like legit two hours and u have no regrets this place is awesome. Go here for some bad ass Hakka"}
{"text":"A nice, reasonable hakka Chinese place. As someone who's frequents Chilli Chicken House, I would have to say that Eddie's puts up a decent effort.
Went with a group of friends and ordered the chicken lollipop to start off with - not what I was expecting; it was like fried chicken - no sauce, nothing on it.
We got veggie chow mein, veggie fried rice - both excellent. Singapore chow mein - bland.
Chilli chicken, Manchurian fish and veg Manchurian - all pretty good, though the flavour profile for the chilli chicken was very boring - not spicy enough, no tang. 
You don't get the quantity for what you are paying. 
I would say its definitely worth trying out and its more probably in the top 3 or so best hakka places in Mississauga/Brampton."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere here were great- the place was totally packed on a Tuesday night. Would be 5 stars except for the fact that a couple of our dishes came out a bit on the cold side- we ordered about 7 mains and it's understandable that they didn't all come off the heat at the same time. Other than that the servers were exceptional and very happy to help. Will definitely head back here again next time out in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Now this is by far amongst the best Hakka Chinese in GTA and anyone who likes desi chineses would agree with me!!This definitely reminds me of Dubai's Chinese food!

This place is where you order American chopsuey, Hakka chowmein, crispy beef, manchurian chicken/beef, chilly fish!!NNNOOOTTTT a place where you order tom yum soup or tandoori chicken!!

As far as the taste goes I would give them an 8 and portioning would be a 10.I never do specials here always get full portioned entrees which later become my next days lunch!They even do entrees without spice which works out great with kids.

I have been here several times and enjoy it since I like their flavoring and food and I do tend to overlook all their FLAWS which are as follow:

-The place has no ambience because it's always packed when I have been here and tables are set neck to neck leaving barely much privacy for dinners.

-They might bring your order in intervals and you can request them otherwise-I always do.

-Long waits can be an issue too and somehow I have always managed to avoid  that by either going a little earlier than dinner time or a bit later!This has always worked for me.

Eddies is not someplace I make a plan and go to, to enjoy a meal-it's just one of those places which I crave for once in a blue moon and end up going!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight, as a big party of 9. They accommodated us without issue, and with minimal wait.

Between the 9 of us, we had:
- Chicken Pakora (Appetizer)
- Shrimp Pakora (Appetizer)
- Veggie Pakora (Appetizer)
- Tom Yum Soup (Appetizer)
- Deep Fried Spicy Eggplant (Appetizer)
- Crispy Sesame Beef x 2
- Mango Salad
- Honey Garlic Fish
- Butter Masala Chicken
- Sweet and Sour Manchurian Chicken
- Veggie Fried Rice
- Chicken Fried Rice
- I think 1 or 2 other things but I can't remember haha
- 7 mango juice, 2 soft drinks, and 2 beers

Opinions / experience:
- All the appetizers were really nice. The veggie pakora was the least spicy of the 3, but I think had the best flavour. The shrimp had a medium spice, and a nice taste. The chicken pakora was full of flavour, but a bit too spicy. The eggplant was yummy, although the deep fried batter taste was more prevalent than the eggplant. My brother had the tom yum soup (a fave of his) and said it was comparable to places near his house that are 'authentic', so I guess that's high praise. The pakora dishes came with a nice green chili sauce for dipping. We were pleased with the appetizers.

- The rice dishes were your typical fried rice places (large quantities, too), but the waiter told us the entrées didn't come with rice, which is why we ordered both of those... and despite this, we received 9 bowls of white rice as well... had he accurately told us it came with those bowls of rice, we'd have stuck with that and not ordered the fried rice as well

- Of the main courses, the ones we liked the most were the crispy sesame beef (it's excellent) and the butter masala chicken (great sauce, good combination of spices). Both delicious and we devoured those. The sweet and sour chicken was pretty good... the mango salad was a refreshing change for the palette... and I don't know about the fish. I don't eat fish. 

We liked the experience because, as a family, we shared everything rather than 'each person has this' which made it a more enjoyable time. Having tried almost everything, I thought it was all good and no dish in particular was disappointing. Usually when you order that much stuff, you're left with at least a few sub-par items, and I think everything here was at least 'passable', if not 'good'

It's certainly not cheap though. It came to around $250 with tax and tip (approx $27 per person)

I think a party of 4 could get away with no appetizers + 3 entrées shared amongst the 4 + the white rice it supposedly comes with + drinks, and that would be about $17 a person, but I think ordering anything less wouldn't be enough food. So $17/person (with tax and tip) is I think the lowest you can manage there, reasonably.

I'd go back, but given that I'm stingy, it would be very infrequent."}
{"text":"This used to be one of the best Hakka places in town but they have gone down dramatically. I used to visit this place once a week when I used to work nearby. Visiting it again in the last few weeks has left me disappointed. The service level has gone down, the quality of food has gone down. Mind you, they still offer a great lunch menu at a great price (all other Hakka places do too). The restaurant is manages to keep busy at dinner so I will recommend making a reservation or coming early."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not conveniently located close to me but when i pass by missasauga on the 401, i tend to make a stop for it. 

The only thing that keeps me coming back is really just the fish pakora (im a sucker for good fish pakoras!), the chilli chicken was good also. I tried the cripsy beef , hot and sour soup but those are not impressive. another thing i noticed... they keep the restaurant very cold! maybe spicy food suppose to give you enough heat so you don't need to eat in a warm environment?? didn't work for me. 

still probably will return... for fish pakora."}
{"text":"We came here for a colleague's birthday lunch and it was just ok.

I have been here a couple of times in the last few months (with work peeps as its fairly close to our office) and haven't been blown away.

I find the food pretty oily in general. This most recent time I had the Manchurian paneer lunch special with steamed rice and requested less oil in the preparation. I find their dishes to be pretty heavy and this time was no exception so I wasn't able to finish my meal. Flavours were pretty good but the greasiness for me overpowers the dish.

I will say their lunch specials are inexpensive and they do offer a lot of choices plus the portions are large so if you are into quantity over quality, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Alway rediculously Packed, The food is great at $10 for an entree that feeds about 4. Anytime my family has a formal gathering we dine at Eddie's."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, will continue to go :) love the house specials. I usually order this \"to go\" because the restaurant itself is small and crowded on a weekend so it's better to have it at home in your PJS. also if you order takeout you get more food so it's a win win. 

Try the hot and sour soup!!"}
{"text":"I went to Eddie's and to be honest I really didn't care for the atmosphere, but my wife really likes the food here...so we went. I had the Tandoori chicken and it was DELICIOUS! It had just enough spice and with the white rice, it was more than filling. 

Since I work only a five minute drive away, I found myself having the same Tandoori chicken meal for lunch, so that's back-to-back days I had the Tandoori chicken. 

It's probably the only meal I would eat there, because it was more than satisfactory in my opinion."}
{"text":"Summary:
Panda Express, done quasi-Indian style. Atmosphere was pretty good, portion sizes were big, and service wasn't terrible. That said, I was unimpressed with everything else. I had:

Curry Chicken spring roll
Spicy Delux chicken (one of their specialties)

The chicken roll was inventive. Indian spiced ground chicken inside a spring roll wrapper. However, it was fairly puny for the price, and even came with a little plastic packet of generic plum sauce. Disappointment.

The spicy delux chicken was another thing altogether. Now let me preface this by saying I LOVE Manchurian chicken. It's one of my favorite dishes in the world. I've eaten it in dozens of restaurants, my mother makes it every time I visit home, and I really appreciate the complexities of flavor. I was told that this was Manchurian chicken. If that was the case, then this was by far the worst I've had. The sauce was thick, tomato-based, and sweet. The chicken was far too heavily battered, and worse, was soft... as if it wasn't freshly cooked or wasn't cooked thoroughly enough. It reminded me of a generic Panda Express red sauce chicken, but made with better ingredients and barely any vegetables.

Bottom line:
The food was filling, quantities were big and its relatively cheap for that. However, if you have a complex palate and want good food, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Lollipop chicken was pretty decent. Mongolian chicken was pretty good. Mongolian beef wasn't good. Fried rice and hukkah noodles were also not bad."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Eddie's after hearing my Tdot friends rave about it for ages! Having no Hakka Chinese places in Montreal, we definitely make sure to have it when in Toronto.
On our first day in Missisauga, we decided to grab a quick bite there as we already had dinner plans later on. We ordered two items only - chicken pakora and hakka beef noodles. All I can say is... WOW! Absolutely delicious, huge portions and very quick service. The chicken pakoras are big and very meaty - unlike other places that make them more bite-sized. The noodles were so delicious, the flavours addictive and it aroma was wonderful. The beef pieces in the noodles were very tender and we were both full just sharing the one portion. I am so glad I chose the Hakka noodles over the Manchurian - the latter are red, covered in sauce and more spicy. Hakka I find are much more flavourful and my personal favourite.

On our last day in Toronto, despite there being a plethora of restaurants to choose from, we had to go again! This time we ordered spring rolls and hot & sour Manchurian soup for starters. The soup was amazing, delicious and spicy full of veggies and topped with crispy noodles... I'm in love! For mains, we again ordered the beef hakka noodles (couldn't resist) and chilli garlic chicken as advised by our waitress. The chicken was OK, the pieces were huge again and it was drizzled with a chilli garlic sauce. I wouldn't order it again. 

The downsides of this place are: 
- Every item nearly is between 11-16$. For many items, I found it overpriced.
- If like me, you are not a fan of steamed rice, you cannot change it when ordering the chicken/beef/curry type plates. The worst thing is that they don't have any accompaniments - just main plates. You have to order one of the huge fried rice or noodle plates if you want to have them together. So not great if you are a couple as there ends up being too much food. 

Overall, great cosy family interior, good service (waitresses are friendly and helpful) and extremely tasty food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I know this place is like a legend and I've had many good times with my friends here, but on a recent visit I noticed the portion size was really small for dishes, seems like they use smaller plates almost, and the food was a little salty. 

But it was still really busy though. And everything else was fine, but I think they gotta step their game up in light of all the other new Hakka places popping up in sauga."}
{"text":"Dear Eddie's,

Will you come to Michigan? Sure, it's a bit more than you thought you'd travel to work but there is an army of food lovers who would crowd your restaurant night after night, relishing every dish to the last bite.

Every time I visit Toronto, the first thing I want to do is eat at your restaurant. Every time we leave? We pack up a cooler full of your goodies (the chili paneer, shameless amounts of containers of your noodle dishes, and your SOUPS, glorious soups!) and head home, praying no police officer pulls us over to confiscate some of Mississauga's finest fare.

I will pay anything for what you serve and have never been disappointed. Everyone I have ever told about your restaurant has fallen in love with you. But I love you more, don't believe them. Plus, I will tip you better. I know your worth.

Til the next time we meet, adieu. The people who have reviewed you poorly have clearly not been to the same restaurant as me or experienced a rare fluke. I love you still.

Sonali"}
{"text":"I think I have figured out the kind of hakka i don't like, the kind served by this place!
Went there last night and I am still struggling where to begin.

Service:
i) Asked if their chow-men had vegetables and told that it doesn't; Guess what? chow-men had veggies and had to be sent back.

ii) We found Hair in the rice ball, server made a face how i would imagine \"FML\". Took the bowl of rice and brought back another after a while, because apologizing is too mainstream.

iii) The only good thing about the service was that it was fast, food came pretty quickly and stuff.

Food:
Okay to absolutely tasteless

i) Chicken Pakora - okay, this was very acceptable and tasty.
ii) Shezuan Chicken - Chicken with salt and gravy and some veggies.
iii) Chilli beef - Beef with salt and gravy, absolutely tasteless.
iv) General Tsao - okay this had some sweet and sour taste, the only thing we ate happily.
v) Chow-men - Tasteless noodle with chicken
vi) Chicken Fried Rice - Rice was wet, the only thing they have to take care of when cooking.

They had Pad Thai, we were gonna order but got to know that it's made with Tomato Sauce, what kind of Pad Thai is made with Tomato sauce?

Server came to fill water, asked if we wanted the chilli beef to take out since it was barely touched, we said no and he went \"OH\", that's it.

You know, you'd think that a hair was discovered in the rice bowl, the least a restaurant would do is take it out of the bill right? NOPE! no apology and the dish was still there on the bill.

We were so done with the place that we didn't even argue, paid and left. What a waste of appetite."}
{"text":"This is the sibling restaurant of Asian Wok n Roll that's down the road.

Though this place is small without a reservation you'll be waiting for a while, and in general the restaurant gets packed quickly. 
I found the fountain in the centre of the restaurant a bit of a distraction because it can be a nuisance to get around especially during the dinner time rush of people sitting along the sides. 

Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgable of what was recommended.  

In terms of food; what stood out from the rest was their Chicken pakora 5/5: not oily, freshly made, perfect size and great presentation...it was perfection.
Their chili chicken was alright about a 2/5 reason being, the pieces of chicken were huge, and I felt that the chicken could have been stir fried a bit longer.
Crispy beef 4/5 beatiful presentation, taste was pretty good, but most of all it was soft...hence easy on the teeth, and portions were sufficient.
Chicken Hakka noodles was about a 3.5/5, portion was great, taste was ALRIGHT, I still thnk Goodluck Hakka restuarant in Scarborough still makes the best.
Manchurian Eggplant; 2/5, I dont think it was even manchurian, it lacked the manchurian spice...,...... 

not to sound BIAS, but I find there's more competition our EAST where most of the better Hakka restaurants are located."}
{"text":"LOVE Eddie's Wok N Roll! I would say it's my second favourite Hakka restaurant, although I frequent it often because of its location to me. 

Portions are generous at Eddie's, you'll definitely have leftovers. 

This is a place where my husband and I often take company and they all seemingly like it (varying from guests who like mild foods to spicy). 

My recommendations would be the chicken and shrimp hot and sour soup (there's visible portions of meat in there, no looking around for a shrimp). The chicken pakoras, chilli chicken (I prefer to get it dry instead of with gravely), crispy beef, Manchurian paneer and Hakka chicken noodles. These are our regular dishes which we circulate.  

To me Eddie's always delivers in satisfying my cravings"}
{"text":"Easily one of my most favorite places to go!' Great staff, great service and phenomenal food. The portions are excellent and the prices are insane. The quality and quantity far outweighs the cost. I could recommend this place to anybody and I've taken several customers with me."}
{"text":"Food Truck quality Chinese , cheap veggies used , super spicy not for food connoisseurs.

South Asian may enjoy this food . No Chinese flavours at all . Only soya and spices .

Disappointed !!"}
{"text":"I am sorry but this was a horrible experience. There was no cutlery on the table and food was served. The servers stood around talking to each other and checking their phones. 

 The thing that really bothered me was when I asked for the manager behind the bar (Asian guy) pointed to another server and said she is part of management and completely ignored me. 

Not coming again."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here per sign on the restaurant. Went here for dinner recently and it was packed (Friday night).  Ordered the Beef Chowmein (OK), the Sweet & Sour Chicken (OK) and the Spicy Garlic Fish (Good) with Chicken Corn Soup (Good) and Mango Lassi (good).  Was disappointed in the Sweet & Sour Chicken as it didnt taste as sweet as I'm use to (almost non-sweet) and the Chowmein was also not very flavorful and kinda bland.  Service was fast, but had to wait at least 15 - 20 minutes for a table (for two).  Have to come back again to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times! 
Best Hakka food that I've tasted so far.
Sometimes there is a HUGE line up, but I've always been lucky and smart enough to go before the dinner rush (which starts around 6)

Price is fair.

I would recommend the Manchurian fish!
It's spicy! And the flavor is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Not the best Hakka food, but very good.

Recommend the crispy beef, chilli chicken and general tao."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto/Mississauga for two days, and I only had a couple of requirements for my short time there: (1) I wanted chocolate Timbits from Tim Horton's because the American equivalent (Dunkin' Donuts) is major suckfest, and (2) I absolutely must have Hakka food. So Eddie's is where I ended up, and oh em gee (insert girlish squeal), it was amazing. Manchurian fish, Chili chicken (dry), shrimp pakora, and fried rice. It was Asian food deliciousness that made me feel like a beached whale, but you might as well call me Shamu because never have I been so happy to refer to myself as a beached whale. 

The service was pretty stellar in that every waiter/waitress in the joint checked up on us, rather than one specific person, although the guy who brought us our food was a bit of a douche. They all move pretty fast too, so it's important to speak up, and speak fast or they'll be gone before you realize it. Eddie can be seen walking around schmoozing with the patrons, which I think is a nice personal touch. The place was absolutely packed, and we had to wait a little while to get our seats, but after trying the food I can see why it would be so busy. 

I think what really sold me on this place was that after we finished eating, I took the leftovers back to my hotel and ate it for breakfast the next day (that's right, breakfast) and it was still absolutely delicious. You know you have something special when leftovers taste good. At that point I knew... I'm moving to Toronto just for the Hakka food. And Tim Horton's. And PIzza Pops. And Smarties. I think that's it. Oh, and for your colored money; it's so cool looking. Except for the twoonies; that's just ridiculous."}
{"text":"We did take out on Thursday night and the flavour of the food was great, as always.
The mango salad was tasty but did not have any nuts in it....presumably because they would get soggy?
I ordered gf veg fried rice (no soy sauce) which we thoroughly enjoyed. The veg Hakka noodles were enjoyed by the others but I did not try it as I wasn't sure if they were gf.
The veg Manchuria (pakora style) was enjoyed by all but the texture seemed different from when we ate there in the past. Nice and flavourful.
The Szechuan eggplant was spicy and well cooked (soft, not chewy). We got plenty of steamed rice with our meal.
The chili chicken, my family's favourite, was great....well cooked and spice level perfect.
My hubby complained of heartburn the next day and leftovers became gelatinous in the fridge (lots of starch in the sauces??)
We always say we don't want to eat here again but then crave it every couple of months."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of hype from my friends about how great this place is. Was sorely dissapointed. Went for lunch. Was seated promptly, then left to our own devices for 10 minutes after which I had to ask the lady behind the bar for the menus. After receiving the menus we still were not acknowledged by the staff for another 5-10 mins, after which waiter took our order. Ordered the the lunch special schezuan chicken with corn soup. Soup was salty to my taste. Chicken was mediocre at best, just felt it was lacking flavour. I was most unhappy with the service as we were only acknowledged once when the server took our order. They never asked for refill on water, how the food was, or if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"This place is great! I am a big fan of the chili chicken, Mongolian beef and Hakka chow mien. Have never had a complaint about the service. There is sometimes a wait but i think that just shows that people love the food. The decor is not what i would expect from a Hakka restaurant and i think it just adds to the charm. Last time i visited this place i had their chili chicken and asked for extra spicy and they definitely didn't disappoint on the heat. They are always pretty accommodating with large groups and are great for takeout with containers overflowing with noodles!"}
{"text":"One of the best place in the city to have a 

hot n sour soup
vegetable manchurian
paneer chilli

and the list just goes on. def a must try."}
{"text":"You can get really good indian Chinese food here. For folks who doesnt know Indian Chinese, I would like to say that you should try that. Imagine indian spicies on Chinese food. This is somewhat close to what we get in indian street Chinese food."}
{"text":"To sum it up: delicious but oily.
Deal with it.
Super tasty Hakka food. If you need to, please Google it. Our family favourites are: veggie manchurian (dry), spicy tiger prawns, garlic chicken, and veggie Hakka noodles. 
As I said earlier, Eddie can give BP a run for its money when it comes to oil slicks. But nothing beats that awesome combination of Indian and Chinese flavours when it comes to nommerlicious food! The spice level keeps me up at night (with heartburn) but also invades my dreams when I'm craving \"home food.\"
Go. Try everything twice."}
{"text":"Met a good friend for dinner on Tuesday night.  I have heard for YEARS that this place is an amazing place to eat Hakka food and FINALLY had a chance to dine there.

Had recommendations to try the Crispy Beef in the past.  

We ended up ordering:

Sesame Crispy Beef
Chilli Chicken
Vegetable Pakoras
Vegetable Fried Rice

What can I tell you?  The Crispy Beef is the best crispy beef I have every had IN MY LIFE.  It is just THAT danged good.  Crispiest ever, bursting with flavour, not chewy, morphin-omenal down the hatch I took it.  Wow!  This dish alone makes me want to go back for more.  I could not get enough!

Veggie Pakoras, were truly delicious.  They reminded me of Nawab Grill's Garlic Balls and they were great.  Loved every bite of this.

Chilli Chicken and Veggie Fried Rice were good, same ol' but yea goes with the rest of the meal.

Excellent experience.  It go pretty busy  there as time went on in the evening.  The service was decent, again not the greatest but whateva, the food was amazing.  I will most definitely will be back in the future and bring along some new folks to try it out."}
{"text":"Personally, I didn't love Eddie's. I think people talk about it being amazing way too much and it's really nothing that great. The veggie chow mein was hard, most likely because of the egg noodles used. The service was slow and I think the quality of the food and restaurant standard can be/used to be higher."}
{"text":"Visited again and skipped the spring rolls after our experience last time. The food was so good! This place makes me eat an obscene amount of food. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place had been recommended to me by many friends so I stopped by to check it out. They have a great section of different Hakka meals and their service was really fast and friendly. I had the Szechuan beef which was was great and had just the right amount of spice. I also like the fact that all the meals come with rice, because there are a couple places that I have been where you need to pay for rice. 

The portions at here are also large so you will not be hungry after."}
{"text":"Everytime we go there the food is just amazing. 
Service can be improved  .
On weekends this place really gets busy and very noisy."}
{"text":"Rarely give out 5 stars but Eddie's deserves it. Quality Hakka food with quick service and consistency. Highly recommend going here for lunch since you can order a dish with a side of rice, spring rolls, and soup for $10! Best bang for your buck but the food also has high pass-out potential so be careful! On night and weekends it gets quite packed and sometimes has 30-45m waiting times, still worth it! I recommend the General Tso's Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and House Special Chow Mein."}
{"text":"Good and tasty food. Good service. 15 mn wait time. Decent price. Sweet n sour manchurian. Choi mein house special."}
{"text":"It's been too long that I've heard hype about this place. My boyfriend finally brought me here to have the best chicken pakoras ever. The chicken pakoras were perfectly seasoned and the portion was very generous. We also ordered the paneer fried rice and was amazed again! The rice was well-fried with flavour and there were huge chunks of paneer scattered throughout the dish. I'm so excited to come back next time to try the noodles... everything just looks so tasty here and honestly, my love for chicken pakoras will def mean another visit sometime soon I hope!"}
{"text":"Our family friends took us to this place as a good bye dinner since we are from out town. We started with some tasty Chicken & Shrimp Manchurian Soup and the hot and sour version too. Added some chilies to it and boy did it clear up my sinuses! We then ordered the following for our entrees: Spicy Garlic Chicken, Mongolian Chicken, Pad Thai Noodles (Chicken and Shrimp) and Chicken Manchurian Fried Rice alongside with some Heineken! All the dishes were awesome but my favorite would have to be the spicy garlic chicken. I loved the crunchiness along with the nice taste of garlic. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food Had heard lots of very good reviews about this place and it is excellent 
The quality taste service is superb super excellent 
The aroma quantity all really good 
The only negative here is it's sooo loud kiss crying loud ppl talking too noisy 
The ambience goes for a toss 
Ordered chilli chicken Nd shrimp chowmein the best in Toronto 
The food here rocks
But sitting there it's like in the middle of a crowded street wth ppl loud Nd several kids crying Nooooo
The best solution is take away order food and 
Bring it home to eat
Every time I go there love it even more"}
{"text":"The first thing you need to know about Eddies is that it is not typical Chinese fare. 

Eddies is Hakka Chinese, the Hakka people left China when communisim emerged and fled to India, Africa, and the Caribbean. 

They opened many restaurants in Calcutta, India. The cuisine was tweaked to suit the local Indian palate using chillies and becoming Halal to acommodate the Muslim community.  My personal favourites are Chicken Hakka noodles and Crispy Beef. 

The Monday to Friday deals are the best value, all under $7 including a soup and mini spring roll.

The staff are usually friendly and Eddie actually comes to the table to make sure all is well. 

If you are a fan of Hakka food you must try Jasmine and Fedricks on Markham Road in Markham."}
{"text":"Highly over rated!! Food is pretty average.  Service is good. Everything taste the same. We order chicken Manchurian and green curry chicken. They all tasted the same.  Overall a sad experience."}
{"text":"Super impressed by this nice sit-down Chinese fusion spot. Bonus points for being a great halal option. We only ordered  Chinese, although they do have Thai.

We ordered their crispy beef- sweet and perfect. No sauce but with the taste of this you may not want anything else.

We also had chicken wonton soup and they are not shy or greedy with packing in won tons. It was very tasty as well. My husband looooved the hot and sour soup. 

There were some side chicken dishes but they were not THAT memorable, but still good.

And a dry chili shrimp dish (B+) and chicken drumsticks (B-)

Fried bananas were a really great ending- if you have room. 

All together, I have to say given good quality, great taste in the majority of dishes, and good service, we will definitely be back when we return to the area."}
{"text":"I wake up in the middle of the night craving chicken pakora of Eddies ! That is just an appetizer by the way which can be shared with 2-3 people! Served with a yummy green sauce those red balls of fried chicken just ascends you to heaven :-)! Their portions are very big 2 to 3 people can eat on a plate of noodle and even their beef /chiken main meal dishes have generous portions of protein in them .. The service is good and quick, the place is quiet busy and hectic sometimes there is often big groups and small parties"}
{"text":"One of  my family's go-to places. It gets very busy, and it can take up to 30 minutes to get seated, so it might be worth going at non-peak hours instead to be able to take your time. The staff are friendly enough, given how they're jetting between tables. 

Love the food but they always seem to be out of the lollipop chicken these days, which is a bummer. I've been there 5 times in the last 3 months, and haven't been able to order it once :("}
{"text":"Another one of my ventures when I was in Canada, the food was great. It is sort of known as Halal Chinese food or INDIAN chinese food. I had tried this before but not at an actual restaurant.  Most Trini folk will cook this for you from Canada or the West Indies.  It tastes different than you typical ny CHINESE ( Chicken with been sprouts or Beef with mixed vegatables).  
The service here was great, super friendly staff as we ate in the restuarant on a weekday afternoon. It was not too busy inside but people were coming in and out for TO-GO orders during most individuals normal lunch hour or late lunch after 3 PM.  
Loved the Manchrian beef and hot and sour soup.  Also got a seafood dish (forgot the name though but it was very spicy- I guess just seafood with vegatable just cooked with curry sauce).
-I will intend to come back next time i am up north in Canada.  The prices seemed very reasonable.  My group ordered alot of food for just the three of us and it was right under $40 and we all left super stuffed.  The place did look very nice inside."}
{"text":"Nice decor, attentive service and nice size portions at fair prices made this an easy 4 star choice for me. Try the soups here (even the small size will satisfy you) I really enjoyed the spicy chicken and shrimp, and my companion had the Thai Spicy soup. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Chicken Pakora for the win!

Love the chicken pakoras here. Not oily at all. Perfectly cooked. Crisp on the outside and tender/juicy on the inside. Great chutney/dip that comes along with it.

Other usual culprits such as Hakka Noodles, Chicken Manchurian and veg or chicken fried rice are pretty good too.

We tried the coriander chicken but were left utterly unimpressed. Soggy and poorly done.

Usually it's full on weekends so there's a wait period unless you make a reservation."}
{"text":"This place is good but all their dishes are $2.00 or $4.00 more than other restaurants.

$16.00 incl tax for a lemon chicken dish that is no different from other restaurants?!!! No thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Went here 4 times in the last 3 years and have yet to be wowed. Somewhat spicy and over sauced Chinese food. Not sure what the big deal is."}
{"text":"We go to this place often when we have a birthday lunch in the office.
$7.75 gets you a soup (hot and sour or sweet corn), a fried roll and a main with steamed rice. 

I got the Chilli FISH with steamed rice and my main.
It was amazing, lightly battered fish in a spicy chili sauce, terrific.

The Roll i could do without.

The Service is ultra fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Overpriced
Low quality meat and chicken
Everything is fried in burnt oil 
Super arrogant service staff
Disorganized
Unprofessional staff"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place is always packed. After going here twice, I'll never return. The food was way too salty or had a huge dose of gooey cornstarched brown 'sauce'. The only difference between this and some run of the mill 'Chinese' mall court place is the seating.  Same indescrible overly salty brown sludge on oil laden deep fried meat.

They really skimp on the fresh vegetables as well. Asian Wok n Roll is the same price but much higher quality. At least at Asian Wok n Roll, they use fresh vegetables and the sauces are different from each other.  Eddie's is all brown gunk on rice. 

I'll admit it's really affordable ($8 for soup, entree, rice, and a spring roll) and super quick for lunch."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but the quality has dropped a lot!

I would give the food 4 or 5 stars. I've never been disappointed with the food. I particularly like the spicy garlic fish (very saucy, maybe even too saucy) and sesame beef.

The atmosphere and decor and stuff is the same as it's always been. Average - nothing special. It's not as busy here as it used to be so that might speak to the quality and service.

There used to be this one waiter that my parents and i liked, he was very attentive and efficient. Now however the service is hit and miss. It doesn't seem like they're assigned specific tables and just kind of wander which would be fine usually, but lately i find that they're socializing with each other a lot and not paying attention to customers like they should. 

I do not think i'm being picky since it has been like this the last few times i've been here. Like i said, used to be really good here everything considered, but not anymore."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love Hakka food and this place exceeded my expectations.

Came in here and was seated righted away. Food was amazing and service was great.  I did enjoy the Mango Lassi ugh it was to die for!  I'm stuck between Hakka Ren and this place.  Although Hakka Ren also has amazing Hakka food, the service here is a lot faster than it is at the other place.  You do get your food much quicker here than at Hakka Ren.  

1 point for Eddie's Wok N Roll!"}
{"text":"real packed but food is really good. A little slow but can't blame them. Portions are tiny compared to other hakka themed restaurants."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and every time I enjoy it. Very good food and great service. The portions are also large. 

LOVE the Crispy Sesame Beef which is their specialty...absolutely delicious! 

Halal, Hakka-style great tasting food! Does get packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"I have heard that if you want the best Hakka food then Eddie's is the place to go. This was evident in the fact that there was like a 30 minute wait line to get a table. Luckily I beat the crowd, since I guess I was a bit early, and got seated immediately. 
I've never been a fan of Hakka cuisine from previous experiences of the food being overly greasy for my liking. Since my mum really likes it, I decided to take her here.
She started off with the tom yum soup, while I got the hot and sour chicken and shrimp soup. I really enjoyed my soup, however she wasn't a fan of hers. 
Let me add that my soup arrived much earlier than my mums, whereby once I finished mine then came hers.
To avoid the reoccurrence of my greasy Hakka experiences, I opted for the safest option, which was the dry tandoori fish even though it was on the pricier side. 
My mum ordered the Hakka noodles. While placing the orders we specified to go easy on the oil, after which we got a snarky response saying that the food is cooked in oil so there has to be oil. He then said that he'll mention to go slightly easy on it.
Our food arrived and the noodles were shining with oil. The tandoori fish looked good but it did not look like a 'tandoori' fish to me. I took a bite and immediately realized that it was deep fried. When we asked, the employee told us that all their food are fried and that by 'tandoori' they meant the flavor, not the style of cooking. 
I guess that was my fault for not asking. 
So, I decided to order the mango salad to add something light. It was okay.
Overall, I would say for someone who doesn't mind greasy food this place would be great. The portion sizes are generous and the place is nicely furnished.
But I feel the prices are quite high and the food was just not my style."}

{"text":"So after hearing several people rave and rant about this place for years,
I finally went there with my family for dinner last night.
Upon entering we saw the restaurant was almost all full which made me feel that it will be good food.
We got the table pretty quick.

We ordered soup and drum sticks for starters.
The starters came out pretty fast but we had to ask 4 servers to give us soup bowls so we could eat. After several requests and minutes of waiting, we got them finally.
The hot & sour soup - the cook/chef forgot to put any salt in it. Plus the chicken didn't smell fresh 
I had to ask a server for salt as there was none on our table. After putting some salt and hot sauce in it, it got a little better but this was the first time in my life that I pour soup in my bowl and eat only half a small bowl and put it aside. Yeah it was that bad. 

Then come the entrees.
Seemed like frozen chicken and frozen fish used in their entrees. Unbelievable quality.

As for All the people who like this place- they probably just have taste for low quality food. That's all I can say.

Will I ever go there again? NEVER"}
