{"text":"Three Birds did the classy thing and sent us a $50 gift certificate for our troubles."}
{"text":"The restaurant is struggling with service.  I've been going to Three Birds for years, and the service has always been just right.  No longer, and it's not fun to wait 20 minutes for your server to come take your drink order.  We had a very inexperienced server, and I'm generally willing to give new staff the benefit of the doubt.  Thank goodness for the busboy who helped find our server for us on 3 occasions.  And, if they expect the servers to make espresso, they need to teach them how.  Too bad -- I like and want to support this restaurant, but right now, they have too many kinks to work out."}
{"text":"3 Birds is an elegant dining experience right in the heart of Lakewood. They offer a hand-picked, seasonal menu picked by their executive chef. They offer a full bar and a wide selection of wine from which to choose.  In addition, they have an amazing outdoor patio you can use during warmer weather. It really makes you feel like you're sitting on a European avenue enjoying dinner."}
{"text":"Used to be an aboslute favorite patio dining place. Took the boyfriend there last week only to learn that the lower part of the patio is now apps and drinks only and to order dinner you are asked if you want to \"move up\" Huh? Yep. You have to actually leave one table to go up about three stairs and sit in the main patio area. Ridiculous.   Service was incredibly and inexplicably slow. As in about 1/2 hour to even get a glass of wine let alone an app. The app was fine, drinks fine but the whole thing was unsettling. The owner who bought the place a while ago, came by to explain the new approach to the patio but seriously, this isn't Around the Corner, dude. (He also owns that place) THree Birds is a fine dining restaurant....or was. Most disappointing and not on the top of my list anymore. Heard the same from the table next to us.   They will also be changing the name of the restaurant in Sept and are asking patrons for suggestions for a new name. Tacky. Probably a good thing tho. Thee THree Birds brand won't be tainted by whatever they are trying to do with the seating.  Moving up indded."}
{"text":"We have a lot of great restaurants in Cleveland and Three Birds is one of them.  This past Friday I had one of the best restaurant meals in recent memory and so did my friends.  A great salad, swordfish and a great dessert in a terrific atmosphere served by a helpful staff.  Can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"As an out of Towner (New York), I liked the atmospere, the service and the apps and sides were great but my entre the cajon pork tenderloin was dry/overcooked. Overall solid place to go. Would go back again."}
{"text":"We celebrated our wedding anniversary at Three Birds.  We were seated promptly however our table was way in the back and up against a wall and I looked at a wall all night. The waite staff was attentive.  We orders the cheese plate as an appetizer.  It had three small pieces of cheese, a few crackers, walnuts,blueberries, dates and a couple apricots. Before we had a chance to finish our cheese plate, the next part of our meal arrived. It would have been better if we could have had time to finish our appetizer and not feel rushed to move on to the salad/soup.  I ordered a salad and my husband had the soup of the day.  Both were ok.  I had the filet tenderloin.  It came with mushrooms in a wine sauce and a side of asparagus.  My husband had the walleye.  Both meals were ok.    We felt the menu was very limited and although we did find something that we liked, the food was just ok, not great.  We opted against dessert. The total bill came to $115 including tax.  We did have two glasses of house wine.  All in all it was an ok dinner but for the price there are many other restaurants that would have had a better selection."}
{"text":"Fanciest Restaurant in Lakewood Ohio.  GOOD STUFF:  If you're looking for a trendy, upscale restaurant on the near westside Three Birds is a good one.  Close to my house so I've been quite a few times....never had a bad meal there.  The lobster pizza appetizer is big and really good.  Very nice patio during the summer as well.  BAD STUFF:  A bit pricey for your everyday dinner.  More of a special occasion place.  PRICE:  About 100$ for two people with liquor.  OVERALL:  The fanciest place in all of Lakewood.  Would be good on a special occasion date or if you want the atmosphere and not the price sit at the bar, have a drink, and order the lobster pizza appetizer which is almost a whole meal...."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything bad to say about Three Birds. For real.  I was having quite a week at work and knew there was some happy hour time awaiting me at the end, so I held on. I'm so happy I found the strength to survive because otherwise I wouldn't have discovered my new love on Detroit.   In honor of the three birds, here are three highlights:  We ordered from the happy hour menu; we split two food items and each had two cocktails.   1. FOOD! The lobster pizza and ceviche were perfection. So much creamy lobstery flavor on that little pizza! I couldn't get enough! The shrimp ceviche had just enough cilantro to balance it out as a really nice salad/salsa. Obviously we were feeling the seafood that night.   Also, note that at the bar, they don't skimp and give you pretzels or plain peanuts. There's this delicious nut mix (which I needed after a long day of little food and some cocktails in my future) that has wasabi peas in it! Favorite!  2. DRINKS! The cocktails I had were the Doctor Bird and Satisfy My Soul. I was on a ginger ale kick and there was candied ginger in my drinks! Cute and good balance! In the end, I preferred the Doctor Bird, but that might be because I went from a milder drink to a pretty serious strong one. My friend had The Jamaican Blackbird and No Woman No Cry. Both were fantastic as well.   3. AMBIENCE! The style of the interior and the mood of the bar was fantastic. We sat at the bar and loved the drawers behind the bar with wine corks and various Barbie body parts in them. The lighting is also different and very calming.   I really can't wait to get the chance to go here again! I want to make my way through the cocktails and happy hour food and I'm finding that I have no patience for it! I want it now!"}
{"text":"the best high priced resturaunt i've been to in cleveland.  overall slightly better than lola and flying fig, which are both excellent as well.  it's very modern looking on the inside and the front patio is very well landscaped, perfect for outside dinning.  the food is excellent and the service was equally good, well worth the money.  the best thing is u can dress up if you want or wear shorts and a polo.  my kind of place.  very different atmosphere than swingos or blue point and much better!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to make a good impression with someone, whether it is a date or just your mom, you should bring the person to Three Birds in Lakewood on a nice evening and sit on the patio. If you have already had dinner, try their desert or martini list. This place has serious ambiance and it will definitely lift the mood, and your status! It is the type of place where experiences are made. If I were you, I would save this secret weapon for a hard to impress date. It will knock his or her socks off. And if you own a dress, you should wear it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been talking about going there for a while and finally had the opportunity when her parents were in town this weekend.    The environ is phenomenal,  inside and out.  The way the place looks and feels make it seem like an even more special occasion.    I had a Lemon Mojito which was quite good, very refreshing and mixed well.  Our server was very nice, seemed knowledgeable but couldn't diverge from his planned script.  We were only there for drinks and appetizers but he seemed determined to let us know all of the daily specials.  Each person at our table had a salad, either caesar or green with one exception, one person ordered the empanadas.  The Caesar salad I had (with anchovies) was quite good, and that was sentiment echoed by the others at my table.  I got to try the empanadas which were good as well.    The lobster pizza we shared was disappointing.  Others found it very salty, I was simply unimpressed.  The crab cakes were average.  We took exception, however, to the staff's incessant desire to clear the table of any food.  Almost a half dozen times we had to assure them that we were \"still working\" on the last remnants of our food.     Bottom Line:  Disappointing first time.  Some annoyances with staff.  Might be willing to try again for a full dinner."}
{"text":"One of the top four restaurants in Cleveland, I've been twice and been amazed both times.  The thing about most restaurants is that their dishes vary; someone might have an awesome soup, but only a mediocre steak.  Three Birds had uniformly tongue-dazzling food from start to finish.  The flatbread appetizer with apricot and goat cheese was so stellar that we could have just had that, and the meals were also excellent.  The atmosphere is also gorgeous.    The only down side is the price; it is spendy.  Save it for a night out - we've gone for two anniversaries now, and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh the anticipation, oh the rave reviews, oh the talk, oh... The Weird Mixing of Flavours and Heavy Salt!  My date decided to surprise me with a visit to Three Birds.  What a wonderful venue with a beautiful patio.  The kitchen opens into the restaurant and provided the only music for the dinging room.  Strange.  The service was good and our waiter was happy to answer my numerous questions concerning ingredients in dishes etc.  He was also happy to offer that the kitchen would prepare something for me, should I not find anything to suit my needs on the menu.  Disappointing to me was the lack of Vegetarian Options on the Menus, save the typical Pasta Dish. (Dear Chefs, please note that not all vegetarians eat pasta.  Vegetarian = Vegetables)  An enticing looking bread basket was provided to our table.  The butter was herbed and salted, not a nice mix for the bread which too was heavily flavored with different herbs.  For starters I tried the chilled potato and curry soup.  There were some interesting blends of flavours going on and not ones I was sure I enjoyed.  The curry was not noticeable in the soup either.  My date enjoyed a simple salad.  I ordered the herb-crusted Grouper for an entree, served upon a bed of watercress, with cornichon, and croutons.  The grouper was much too greasy for my taste and the dish was overwhelmingly salty due to the cornichon and the dressing.  In addition to the oil concentration in the fish, the croutons were mushy and greasy as well.  Again, not a blending of flavours I would recommend.  My date selected the scallops for his entree.  They were prepared well, but the sauce was overwhelming to the scallop.  The most exciting thing for me on the menu was the use of fiddlehead ferns with the scallops.  It is refreshing to see a chef utilize in-season produce and prepare it appropriately.    Dessert was a flourless chocolate cake, with raspberry chocolate mousse, and pistachio cookie.  For a girl who loves her chocolate and dessert, this was another disappointment.  The cake proved less of a flourless cake and more of a dark chocolate mousse.  The pistachio cookie was almost flavorless and the chocolate mousse was incredibly too thick and overbearing for the rest of the dessert.  Three Birds is trying too hard to meld flavours and create something \"new\".  I am a great lover for experimentation, however some things were just not meant to go together.  Additionally, the large quantities of salt used in each dish were overkill.  Three Birds, you were a disappointment and an overpriced one at that.  Shall I return?  Perhaps, but only for a glass of wine and perhaps a cheese plate on that lovely patio."}
{"text":"Three Birds. It's been around for several years and I finally got around to paying them a visit.   First impressions are everything. Upon walking into their courtyard patio, my first impression was \"Christ, this place is beautiful.\" I've honestly never seen such a gorgeous, classy looking patio.   Then entering the building, I was wowed again. This place has breathtaking ambiance. Exposed brick, deep reds, hints of white. The lighting is soft, soothing, orgasmic.  The food was wonderful. I wouldn't change a thing about any of it. I don't recall ever enjoying duck as much as I did at Three Birds. And the foie gras? -- I'm sorry duckies, but I really LOVE the taste of your fatty livers.    Service was possibly a teeny, tiny bit cold. Our server seemed slightly agitated with us for reasons unknown. Maybe it was because we were side-sitting? Either way, that didn't put much of a damper on our lovely meal and excellent evening.  I'd absolutely return.   And guys:  hint, hint. This is a PERFECT date spot."}
{"text":"Very good food, very nice atmosphere, very good service. I love the patio, what a wonderful, wonderful exterior space.  They do a lot of things right."}
{"text":"So far my favorite place in Cleveland.  Great food (especially desserts!), beautiful garden, good service.  However, last two times I went (and I've been several times now) my food was too salty (I'm kind of sensitive to salt, so other people might not have minded).  Will keep going back though and just be careful about the seafood I order."}
{"text":"I must agree with so many of the previous reviews. Good food (not great like it once was but good nonetheless) but HORRIBLE service. Our server had no idea how to speak to customers and seemed to take an eternity for everything. She also made several mistakes in the orders she took. The patio, however, is still lovely. Hardly worth the long drive from the far east side (like it once was). Too bad."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed foie gras exactly twice in my life: once at Commander's Palace in New Orleans; and now last night at Three Birds Restaurant. We chose it for my birthday celebration with friends visiting from Michigan who we wanted to show just how good the eating is here in Cleveland. Three Birds lived up to our bragging on Cleveland, and how.  The menu is filled with many temptations, so we started with the lamb sausage and goat cheese flatbread, the lamb shank risotto, the asparagus soup, and the sausage and apple soup. The flatbread was absolutely delicious, and I happily brought most of it home with me for lunch today. Each appetizer was delicious, and we happily shared across the table. For the main course, I chose the duck breast, which was the best-prepared duck I've ever eaten - the sauces were excellent, but I ignored them because the duck was divine by itself. And it was accompanied  by the fabulous foie gras. My husband chose the beef filet, which was eyerollingly delicious. The only dish not quite up to snuff was the scallops, ordered by one of my companions. While the preparation was delicious, the scallops could have been just a bit fresher. They weren't bad, just a bit fishy. The final dish was the pork chop, and was also delicious.  The blueberry tart was accompanied by a raspberry sorbet that was one of the most delicious things I've ever put into my mouth. The drinks were also excellent and imaginative, and of course the restaurant itself has a lovely feel. It's spendy, but it's one of my favorite special meals places."}
{"text":"Giving this restaurant two stars is being generous, but I did so because the service and drinks were good. As far as food goes, this was a giant letdown. The salads were plain and not very fresh, and one salad even had gritty dirt on it. The calamari appetizer was slimy and had such a strange flavor it was simply inedible. My husband ordered duck because it is one of his favorite foods. He ordered it medium rare, as recommended, and it arrived at the table well done and gamey. The lobster on the lobster pizza was chewy. My fish dinner was ok, but the fish was so overcooked it was crunchy. The patio was nice, and that's about the only other redeeming quality about Three Birds. Go here for drinks and sit on the patio, but make sure not to order food."}
{"text":"I love 3Birds!! The food is excellent. the staff is friendly and it is so comfy inside and out!! Glad it's close to home! If u haven't tried the cappucinno cup......try it ,it's amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a good, solid dinner here about a week ago. My food consisted of decent seared fois gras (at last a place where I can get my fois fix in the Cleveland area!!) and a pan fried fish that was a bit oily but overall very flavorful and well done.   The decor was a real standout to me. It was earthy and homely but sleek and trendy at the same time. The glass picture of three birds that hung in the middle of the restaurant was very elegant. Because it was night time I sat inside, but I hope to go again during the day so I can enjoy dining in the beautiful patio!  Overall, Three Birds is a nice restaurant. It is a bit noisy, though, due to hardwood floors, so that would be my only caveat for a romantic date."}
{"text":"4 of us decided to dine at Three Birds at 7:00 on a Thursday night.  When we arrived we were seated outside.  It took over 20 minutes for our round of drinks to arrive and when they finally did come we were informed that they were understaffed because of happy hour.  Our server told us that the bar and lower patio were only offered the happy hour prices.  We were sitting upper patio, paying full price for drink and waiting forever for drinks.  We wanted to do a toast but the drinks never came out at the same time and there was always a time when 1 of us didn't have a cocktail.    It took another 15 or so minutes for the server to come back and go over the dinner menu with us and then another 15 or so minutes for him to come back and take our food order.  We all placed another round of drinks at that time and the drinks took over 30 minutes to come.  When our salads arrived 3 of us were informed that they had run out of the tomato pizza.  If I wasn't going to have the tomato pizza I would've chose a different salad.   It would've been appreciated if at the time we ordered we were told that.  At this time it was already going on 8:30 and we had been sitting for 1.5 hours with 2 drinks and only salads.    The manager came out at this point and brought us out the bread we were supposed to have at the start of our meal and bought us another round of drinks.  We all appreciated him coming out to speak to our table and for buying another round of drinks.  That might be the only reason I would decide to go back and try it again.  As a server myself I only want to hear how the problem will be fixed, not how you had severs call off and a list of other excuses.  The garden atmosphere outside was beautiful, the food was fantastic, the drinks were tasty, and the service is the only thing that left a bad taste in our mouth.  Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"Took my wife to Three Birds last night for an enjoyable dinner and we really liked it.  Based on the reviews I've seen on Yelp!, I figured we had to try it some time.  As an appetizer, we ordered the pulled pork empanadas, which were deep fried and served with some yummy sauce.  These were good, but not excellent and there were only three.  Three empanadas creates an issue.  You see, once you and your partner each consume one tasty empanada, only one remains.  So you either share it or you bow to your partner and let them have it.  Either way, you're left wanting more.  Bread and water are served with all meals.  I ordered the daily dinner special, which included a Hawaiian fish seared on the outside and raw in the middle.  It had too much cajun seasoning on the outside, which was very spicy!  It also came with thinly sliced red and green peppers, blue cornmeal cakes, which weren't all that great, and a tiny bit of goat cheese on top.  Overall, the dish looked terrific, but the taste and texture were not that great.  The fish itself had almost no flavor.  My wife ordered the beef tenderloin, which was served with mashed potatoes and something that looked like collard greens.  This dish was delicious!  It was a nice presentation of an American classic.  We ordered a bottle of Montblanc Cabernet Sauvignon Reserva 2007 and it was one of the better wines I've had.  It was kind of sweet for a Cabernet Sauvignon and it went very well with our meal.  For dessert, we split a Creme Brulee, which was served with a small wafer and a few blueberries.  This was delicious, seeing as this is the first time I've had Creme Brulee.  The service was excellent and the atmosphere was very nice.  As I have read in other reviews, I can confirm that this place attracts an older crowd.  However, there was a good mix of young and old.  It would be nice to visit during the summer months to sit out on the nice patio.  Overall, it was a very nice meal, but for about the same price, I prefer Don's Pomeroy House in Strongsville.  With tip and wine, our bill came to $126.  http://www.3birdsrestaurant.com/"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, service on the patio was very good, this is one place we would enjoy going back too. Thank You!"}
{"text":"Beautiful patio, plentiful food...I had a wonderful meal last night at Three Birds. My service started out rocky though, one of the servers half cleared the extra settings and left it on the table, even my actual server was confused why it was only half cleared. They also neglected to leave a bottle of water (every table gets one) until I asked for a refill. Minor details but still a part of the experience.  Other than that the food was delicious. For starters, we ordered the foie gras (yum) along with some foccacia for the table (yum). BF had the beef tenderloin that was cooked to perfection, served with rosemary fries and a great blue cheese dipping sauce. I got the seared sea scallops which were served on a bed of truffles mashed potatoes and lightly sauteed corn. There wasn't a crumb left on either of our plates.  I would definitely like to come back. The patio looked amazing but too bad it was raining when I went. I was informed by the waitress that the restaurant was changing owners (and will have a new name) but everything else will stay the same. Here's hoping."}
