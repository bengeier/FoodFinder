{"text":"We live out in the country near Black Earth, and as far as I know this is the only pizza (or any!) place that delivers to us.  Lucky for us, it's actually really good pizza!  The specialty pizzas are pretty tasty and the endless coupon for them means they're reasonably priced to boot.  It's hard to pick a favorite one, but probably Meatball, Bacon Ranch, and Southwest (with steak!) get ordered the most.  I think we're probably towards the edge of the delivery area, but pizzas usually come pretty quick and they're always really hot.  I feel bad making them drive out this far, so I tip pretty decently, so maybe that affects how quick they get out here.  Either way, they're very good and I can definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"Been there many times. At first I wasn't a big fan until I realized you can get thin crust. There thin crust pizza is really good. Also they have really good bread sticks. For the price you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Our favorite is the chicken ranch.
Quick delivery and a great staff."}
{"text":"Nice to have a pizza place in Cross Plains!  The Cinnamon twists with frosting are the bomb!  It's take out only!"}
{"text":"I used to go there all the time, I no longer will though. This place has horrible service, one of the cashiers tried to rip me off, and another time the cashier argued with about my order and said I ordered something different. What happened to the customer being right. Also we asked the manager or business owner to call us and they never did"}
{"text":"This place was the best , once upon a time. Looking at the photo reminded me of the fantastic pizzas they had. Last night's was a pre-purchased thin crust and overlooked to burnt on the edge. The toppings were okay. The pasta with noodles was also premade and not fresh. Guessing the owner sold the business. I would give it no stars.
Once the best, now no better than a $3 grocery store frozen.  Never again."}
{"text":"Frequently ordered! Fav pizza place around and hey it's close enough to deliver.  Garlic butter on point.  The mini pizzas are great a cute family night for everyone to have their own for a good price.  Feeds family of 5 for $20-$30 average spent."}
{"text":"Most flavorful , fresh and unique pizzas I have had in a long time ...We have tried the chicken bbq ...hot wing chicken and can't wait to try the cheeseburger pizza! I have also had two different salads which are always fresh and a great portion size ..the prices are very affordable and less then many chain stores around with lower quality food...very impressed wish I lived close enough for delivery"}
{"text":"Driven by Tanos many times and finally made the decision to stop and try it while on a quick lunch hour drive. 
Discovered they don't sell slices but I was very pleased to discover they offer an 'All Mine' pizza, 7\" in size. You can have whatever toppings they offer. I went for my old stand-bye... cheese and sausage, extra cheese. This was a Friday and the 'lunch special' was in effect, so TOTAL cost was $3.11! Well, worth waiting the six minutes to bake it.
Based on other reviews, I didn't know what to expect taste wise but I'd have to agree with Matt W.'s description of the sauce...could use more spices. Tomato really comes through but you expect more from non-frozen za's. I thought the sausage was good but it is pre-made stuff, which most independents use to lower liability.
Overall, for $3 for a lunch size, freshly made pizza to order, not bad and I will stop again."}
{"text":"We live relatively close to Tano's and have had their pizza a number of times.  For a small town pizza joint, they make a pretty mean pizza.  They have a great list of specialty pizzas including a white garlic pizza (that my picky brother-in-law raved about), veggie pizza (that my in-laws loved), and my favorite, the Southwest pizza that's made with barbecue sauce and some kind of amazing white ranchy type sauce. The first time I had it, it was the weirdest pizza I had ever eaten, but after I ate it...I couldn't stop thinking about it! It's very different, but very, very good. I can't really rate them on their \"regular old pizzas\" (aka: pepperoni or a plain cheese) because we've really only tried the specialty pizzas - all which we have been impressed with.

The one big downfall of Tano's?  They are busy. Really busy...probably because they are the only pizza place in a small town. But, they seem to make mistakes a lot.  They are always very gracious about it and offer to fix any issues right away, but definitely check your order!

I think Tano's is doing a great job. We now choose them over the \"bigger name\" pizza places in the Middeton area and other than the occasional errors with our orders, I am a fan."}
{"text":"Tano's is a great pizza joint! I love the quick delivery and tasty pizza. The pizzas are large, and the owners and staff very friendly!"}
{"text":"We order 5 pizzas from Tano's. The pizza was good, sauce was really good. We paid about $62 for the 5 pizzas. Not bad for a small town pizza place. I enjoyed the crust as it tasted like a breadstick and was soft in texture."}
{"text":"Great place to get pizza! For one there pizza is awesome. But just as good is there service! We live outside of Black Earth, WI and not in town. They are the only people who will deliver way out here! Its great! It feels like we live back in town again. So whenever we want pizza, we just give them a call!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to Cross Plains, this is the only place that delivers. And it is DELICIOUS.  I was not let down, when my parents come to visit they don't want me to cook, they want the Philly cheese steak pizza."}
{"text":"The sauce was bitter.  The cheese was very sparse.  The olives were dumped in the middle of the pie rather than dispersed over the surface of it.  I don't know if they have other types of crust.  I wasn't offered any choices when I ordered, but I didn't care for the medium thick crust.  It was too dense.  I ordered from them once before, many years ago, but I won't be ordering again.
The good thing is it was ready for pickup on time"}
{"text":"We called for some details, being from out of town. 
First of all, they answered the phone, \"Hello?\" And then seemed to have no idea what a pizza was. 

For go the Tanos and head to Sauk City, Wi for pizza."}
{"text":"We order here all the time since there isn't any other pizza place in Cross Plains. While they can make good food, and before really thought their BBQ chicken pizza was pretty amazing - they can really drop the ball when it comes to specifics on orders. We've ordered their subs, and everytime they mess up the order. I ask for lettuce and ranch and 4 times in a row they would mess it up. I'm pretty forgiving, but when it happens that many times in a row than someone just isn't paying attention to the specifics of an order."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and this is the only delivery.  I had been hearing VERY mixed reviews about Tano's.  I ordered and we decided to pick it up - they are only delivery or carry-out, no dine-in.  We got the southwest pizza on their hand-tossed crust and an order of breadsticks.  Everything was fresh and really hot! The pizza was really good but I'd probably try the thin crust next.  The dough seemed pretty fresh and it had a nice chewy crust but the inside of the pizza was a little soggy.  The breadsticks weren't anything special but for $3.50 you get a lot of them.  Some of them were a lot bigger than others, therefore some were cooked a lot more.  They must've coated them in butter and then sprinkled parmesan when they came out of the oven.  

Overall we'll definitely order again.  They have a really diverse menu when it comes to specialty toppings which I love.  Maybe we'll try delivery next time."}
{"text":"My latest quest to find the finest pizzas in south central Wisconsin took me to the sleepy burg of Cross Plains (nobody said this job was going to be glamorous).  I had a restaurant.com certificate to Tano's Pizza burning a hole in my pocket and a last minute cancellation of my daughter's soccer practice meant I had time to make the 45 minute round trip to Cross Plains.

Tano's is strictly a carryout / delivery operation wedged in a small storefront on the main drag of the village.  The staff is friendly and happily accommodated my request get the Monday special price (a large two topping pizza for $8.95) with two different toppings on each side of the pizza.  After applying my certificate, the net cost of the 16\" two topping pizza was $4.44, so I give Tano's gets extremely high marks for cost-effectiveness.  

The pizza was piping hot when I picked it up 20 minutes after ordering it.  When I flipped the top of the pizza box, I was impressed with the quantity of ingredients.  My half of the pizza was loaded with sausage and mushrooms.  Mounds of extra cheese covered my daughter's half, along with a sprinkling of feta.

The crust of the pizza was largely flavorless and VERY chewy.  I appreciated the crust was not doughy in the center of the pie, despite a heavy load of toppings.

The sauce lacked any brightness - it tasted like under-seasoned tomato paste. Sauce volume was adequate given the topping load.

The quality of the sausage topping was sub-par - it added practically no flavor.  This pizza was crying out for a little oregano or fennel.  Another big negative was the use of canned mushrooms on my side of the pizza.  The cheese quality was adequate, low on flavor, but not overly greasy.

The final verdict:  While this is not pizza you want to serve to impress your friends, it is a cost-effective way to feed a gaggle of hungry teens when quantity is more important than quality."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Friendly staff. Have yet to disappoint. Great option for dinner in Cross Plains!"}
{"text":"hit or miss. Sometimes it's decent then sometimes they get stingy with there food. Like Mac and cheese bake. One day it'll be heaping and delicious. The next time it will be a small amount and burnt. Seems like they rush the food at times"}
{"text":"We've had Tano's a few times, and frankly, we're just tired of it.  The pizza tends to be dry, and the sauce is nothing special.  By the time it's delivered, or we get it home from carry-out, it doesn't taste fresh.  

While not horrible, it's not something we look forward to.  It's one of those things that you order, don't enjoy it, forget about it, then order it again 6 months later only to be disappointed again.  It's good in a pinch, since there aren't  a lot of pizza options locally."}
{"text":"We tried Tano's immediately after moving to the area. Quick delivery and great pizza--way better than a chain.  The chicken ranch and philly cheese steak are both great! Give them a shot for your next pizza order. 

We've ordered a few other things off the menu in the past few months--the wings, boneless and bone-in leave things to be desired and the Mac and cheese wasn't great. 

Stick to the pizza--neither the breadsticks nor it disappoints."}
{"text":"Just average, maybe.  We order pizza from Tano's mostly because it is the only delivery choice in Cross Plains.  My wife also seems to think it is OK and so we order it much more often than I would.  She would probably rate it 4 stars. Personally I don't much care for it. Way to much sauce, crust that is normally tuff as cardboard, poor quality toppings (really, canned mushrooms?) and then a pizza that looks like a monkey threw it together. The more I think about it, the more I think it sucks."}
