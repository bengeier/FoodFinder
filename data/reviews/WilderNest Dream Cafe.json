{"text":"Ouch, my pocketbook just took a huge hit. I've dined in once before, and just stopped by to take some lunch to go. I ordered a soup ($11!!!!). There also wasn't much to the soup (no protein), so I had to go buy something else for lunch. Only one of the four soup options had chicken, but also had cream which I didn't want. Not only that, they wanted to tack on more $ for one slice of gluten free bread to replace the normal bread that accompanies the soup. I politely declined.

Lesson learned, I'll stick to Insomnia Coffee for an equally sized soup priced fairly at less than $4.00 with more hardiness and flavour."}
{"text":"SO GOOD.  this place was a little pricier than i was expecting (11.95 for a grilled cheese, 13.95 for roasted beet sandwich) but the food was awesome.  the sandwiches came with a choice of side--my friend and i both went for the fruity green salad and it was delightful.  we ordered the sandwiches listed above and shared them.  the grilled cheese was made with smoked cheddar (love it!) and doubters beware, the roasted beet sandwich was fn impressive. if unusual. 

the service was super friendly, and it looks like they make hot chocolates/lattes etc as well, though i didn't try any out. 

i'll definitely head back! tonnes of inventive choices on the menu (for meat-eaters, anyway)."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this a higher star rating, but the service experience I had there just can't justify it.  The food was amazing, there's no doubt - healthy options that are super tasty and good size portions.  It's a little on the pricey side, but once you devour your food you won't even think twice about it.  The service on the other hand could use a few upgrades.  We waited for almost an hour for lunch, and the server was obviously overwhelmed.  It's a great place, so if you have the time definitely check it out, just make sure you don't have to rush off anywhere."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this place. To their defense I am a gluten free eater and it is hard to make good food for a reasonable price. Now back to my explanation. I ordered the gluten free eggs benny with fruit and my friend ordered the regular eggs benny with hash browns. He had three eggs, lots of hollandaise and a huge side dish of hash browns on the side. While mine came with two tiny pieces of gluten free bread two eggs and little hollandaise sauce. Not to mention the fruit was cut super thin and there was not much of it. They charged 2 dollars (maybe more come to think of it) more for the gluten free, which is normal, but then cut back huge on all the other stuff. The bill for 2 of us was over 35 dollars. I felt totally ripped off. I will not be going back there"}
{"text":"I was there for brunch and loved it, eggs were just cooked perfect and tasty, peppers on the side and a few pieces of fresh fruit, potatoes were nicely cooked and seasoned too and coffee fresh in the French press!! very good too."}
{"text":"Can't judge it on food because it doesn't seem to be coming. As for service it's ok we have not been checked on for drinks since we first ordered but the kitchen is useless and needs an overhaul of the cooks. It is not that busy and our table of 4 has been waiting for over an hour and a half."}
{"text":"My favourite place for breakfast, the Wildernest Dream Cafe is in the heart of the trendy, charismatic Inglewood district, kitty-corner to Spolumbos.

Since breakfast is my favourite meal, my standards for a breakfast haunt are fairly high.  The atmosphere, the quality of food, and especially, the quality of coffee are all important to me.  Wildernest scores big on all three.

Atmosphere: a quaint little house is the setting.  Dark wooden benches and chairs; wildlife-themed paintings (including a painting by an elephant), and charming old walls and old mantle make for a lovely and cozy place to sit and enjoy the morning.  I've been here on sunny days and on gloomy, cold days -- no matter what it's like outside, it's always charming and comfortable within.

Food: MY GOSH the salmon eggs benny are simply divine!  A hint of dill in the hollondaise sauce, and a hearty helping of Wildernest's yummy, warm homefries makes the meal even more special.  My absolute top choice for breakie no matter what my mood.  Note: Only available on Saturdays, though (the rarity makes it even better, I think).  

Weekdays, they have a tasty selection of wraps, omlettes, and fluffy buttermilk pancakes.  Haven't been here for lunch, but I'm confident that it'd be tasty too.  I've often been served by the owner, himself -- sincerely concerned for the contentment of all his patrons, he is always friendly and willing to answer any questions about the menu or the locale.

Coffee: I usually get the Americano.  Hot, fragrant, and delicious ... their brew is perfect every time.  I usually add cream and brown sugar -- a steaming cup of joe this good makes my day.  (I usually get three.)

The Wildernest tries to serve high-quality, very yummy meals and coffee.  It is pricer than a chain, yes, but it is also much better in my mind.  I'd rather pay an extra dollar or three and get something made with care, than save the money and have something sub-par."}
{"text":"Not my favorite brunch place in Calgary for a few reasons. 1. It is very, very slow on the weekends. 2. The prices are high even for Calgary. $9 for eggs, toast and granola or hashbrowns. No bacon, no sausage, nothing.

I don't hate it but I do think there are better options. It is obvious by the droves of people here on the weekends that I might be on my own in this opinion, though."}
{"text":"This little caf√© is lovely - we could not believe it was not lined up on a Saturday morning!  Wonderful atmosphere and even better hollandaise sauce! It's location in Inglewood is perfect for a weekend brunch followed by a bit of shopping/wondering."}
{"text":"Me and Kenny stumbled into this cafe trying to awkwardly escape from this lady who began to make us uncomfortable with her crazy stories. Was she crazy? Far for it for me to judge within our 10 minute interaction. But her stories were, they really were.

Anyways Kenny decided to ease my nerves by offering to get me an Americano. As we waited for our drinks I took a look around this cafe. It seems more like an old house you find in a museum, when exhibitions try to show how life was for people back then. The floors and the wall are marinated with nostalgia. Small, and makes for intimate hangouts. A lot of girls catching of with their girlfriends here.

I'm curious about their lunch menu, everyone's dishes looked really delicious but at the time I didn't feel like eating so I skipped out. We were just waiting till the coast was clear.

Their coffee was great, but nothing for me to rave about or put on a list or bring up in conversation. Either you tell crazy stories or boring ones, and I refuse to lull anyone into zzzzzzzZZZZZZ's.

{"text":"This place is great but don't come on a weekend if you are in a rush; the service can be a little slow. However it is worth it for the food and the atmosphere. This is a coffee shop with a nice patio, beers and wine, amazing brunch: eggs Benny, 9+ wraps, yummy pancakes and french toast. Perfectly made frittatas; real Swiss cheese and loads of veggies. I can't say enough about the food. Easily one of the best breakfasts in Calgary from a coffee shop.

The coffee is also made fresh in a french press at your table; it is nice.

My only complaint is they are not open late enough, if they were I would come out twice a week to sit on the patio and eat a healthy wrap or sandwich and enjoy a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Q: Where do you go for a comforting lunch on a rainy day?
A: WilderNest.

There's been a steady downfall of rain the last few days and I've been in need of some real warm and tasty homemade comfort food. Thanks be to the Yelp gods for WilderNest's lunch specials. The Cottage Pie with beet borscht listed when I was last in are just what this yelper needed.

When the lunch special said it came with a side of soup or salad, I assumed the soup was a nice little cup size. I figured \"homemade shepherd's pie and borscht for $14.95? That's not a bad deal!\" And then my meal came out. In front of me sat a healthy bowl of purple beet borscht with sour cream on top and an even bigger bowl of the Cottage Pie. I made it through the hearty bowl of soup and about 1/3 of the pie before my stomach called out to me in protest that it had had enough! Thankfully, they packaged up the rest for me. It was breakfast this morning :).

My coffee came in its own little press-complete with a timer so I'd know exactly when to press it down. A cute little pitcher for cream and what looks like brown sugar (I'll have to ask exactly what it was... it went well with my coffee but sure wasn't your regular old refined white sugar) in a little dish accompanied the press on a small plate.

With pictures of wildlife adorning the walls, and wooden tables and chairs that remind me of a cottage more than a cafe, WilderNest Cafe is a homey and cozy spot to be. And, lo and behold, it's raining again today! Best hop in for one of their lunch specials to warm your innards."}
{"text":"Well, I ended up returning to the cafe for a birthday breakfast, not by choice. I still found the service a bit slow, but it wasn't as noticeable.  I ordered a breakfast wrap and they don't come with anything but a tiny bit of fruit pieces on the plate unless you pay more for sides.  The meal was expensive for the portion size and it wasn't as good as my previous meal here.

The group I was with sat at a large table and I ended up sitting on the bench.  All I had to lean back on was the window ledge.  Not comfortable.  

Overall, I haven't changed my mind about WilderNest."}
