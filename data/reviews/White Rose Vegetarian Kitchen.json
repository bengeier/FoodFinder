{"text":"Very disappointed with the service and some of the food. The soup was lukewarm at best and the tofu dish was cool. They were busy and couldn't handle it, service was very slow. The black bean dish was bland. We had reservations but got stuck at one of the bar height tables with a very uncomfortable wood chair by the freezing cold window. Not likely that we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first dining experience at the White Rose and we loved it! We each ordered three courses to get a good feel of the food options and we loved everything we ate. All items were fresh, hot and tasty! My husband is far from a vegetarian but he enjoyed the refined flavors and left feeling stuffed! We finished the meal off with a digestive bitter which was flavorful and interesting!  Overall we loved the experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great ambiance and good service.  Nice job White Rose"}
{"text":"I cannot rave enough about this food.  I am a card-carrying carnivore and I absolutely love it here . Serisously, if all vegetarian food was this good I'd give up meat tomorrow.  The grilled cheese in particular is to die for!  I'm not sure what the blend of cheeses they use is, but it's substantially delicious.  If you're starving, this probably isn't the place for you as the portions can be a little small and you might need 1.5  - 2 plates to feel fully satisfied.  If you are there for brunch, the omelette is out of this world!  It's made with chimichurri, which has an indescribably good taste.  The owners both cut their teeth at The River Cafe and the quality of their food shows it!     Their service is really great too.  It can take a little while to get noticed sometimes if they're really busy, but once you do they pay good attention to you.    Be prepared to drop a fair bit of money if you come hungry, as plates can be a bit on the pricey side, but not overly."}
{"text":"The White Rose Vegetarian Kitchen is a new addition to the Bowness restaurant scene. This space was originally an old garage which shared its namesake. Don't be scared off by the lack of red meat on this menu as your heart and soul will be satisfied by the flavour combinations and savoury textures.   We had the following plates with descriptions taken from the menu.... Grilled Cheese -Oka grilled cheese on sourdough with smoked tomato jam and micro radish $12  *This sandwich was ooey, gooey and delish!  Yorkshire Bread Pudding -Yorkshire. Pudding with ermite bleu cheese, red spinach, parsnip dark veg. demii. $12 *Seriously amazing texture and flavour profile. One of my favourite dishes for sure!  Braised Broccoli Rabe dried fig, white balsamic, roasted roots, rosemary and jade rice $18 *The vegetables were cooked PERFECTLY and the jade rice was so firm & flavourful!  Dessert followed with 3 types of in house made sorbet; vanilla bean, strawberry/rhubarb and blueberry basil. Absolutely delicious way to end a fantastic evening!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!  Can't believe I waited so long to try this place out. Cozy seating, windows open on a hot day gave me the feeling of being on a deck, there is a patio too. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I came here with a Groupon, but still thought it was a pricey meal.  My friend and I shared four items (grilled cheese, ricotta cake, eggplant and oyster mushroom) and we went to eat sushi after.  Well if the Coal Shed was open we would've ate there after instead.  The food itself  wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either, and I don't find any dish overly creative or anything.  Some flavors were good while others clashed.  But seriously... the price.  $68 for two people and we needed more food after.  It's only vegetables.  Why $18 for mushrooms + egg + potato?   Just on the food alone I would only rate it three stars, but the service was pretty decent, albeit slow.  I also found it interesting that they have pescatarian add-ons."}
{"text":"When we arrived it was quite lively, diners  enjoying their meals. Eclectic nice touches with mismatched dinnerware. Three of us shared four dishes, quite tasty however pricey for very small portions. Roasted red pepper dip in a tiny ramekin. The oyster mushroom tacos were excellent, decent 3 tacos $15. Broad beans with sunflower sprouts, expensive  $17. Food decent but we wouldn't be rushing back..."}
{"text":"Got takeaway from here, along with the Coal Shed, for dinner on our way home from hockey in Bowness.  So these stars are only based on the  takeaway cabbage rolls and goat cheese cake-which were yummy!  Loved the cabbage leaves- this veggie alternative to the traditional meat and rice was really flavourful and had nice textures.  The goat cheese cake was all melted by the time I brought it home, as it was stuck in a bag with hot dishes - so texture I can't really speak to, but the taste was delicious.  Sweet for dessert, and I didn't really taste a lot of goat cheese- but the overall 5 stars are maintained because of the delicious flavours of these dishes.  Can't wait to return for a whole meal!"}
{"text":"New vegetarian restaurant in the NW?  Yes please.   But even better than just any old veggie restaurant White Rose is created by some of Calgary's culinary wizards that have opened a few popular places around town and have worked in some other local institutions.    Anyway,  I've been waiting for them to open and I've managed a few trips in already.  Outside you hardly would recognize that it's a renovated garage,  it's set back a bit from the road but the big old time green trolley is really hard to miss.  Inside it feels like you're over for a special dinner at grandma's house.  Some of the tables are dining room tables, the glasses are like grandmas's crystal, and the little service items are all reminiscent of the good silver that came out for important meals. Everything is a little mismatched so not to be mistaken for the fine dinnerware you might get at a super posh french restaurant - just a little Grandma's house like.   I've tried a couple branches (available on Sundays only):  My husband loves going out for breakfast on weekends and often my options are limited since I'm vegetarian so I kind of hate morning offerings  and often I order lunch for breakfast depending on where we are.  Well, White Rose made my brunch a bit more exciting.  None of the offerings were insanely revolutionary but they are a twists on some favorites and executed well with great attention to detail and top quality ingredients.  So far my favorite is fried oatmeal - weird name but so good (and I'm not an oatmeal person)  I've also tried a dinner:   first of all,  the grilled cheese is where it's at.  I sampled a number of the dishes at the table but I never thought the only thing I could think about after would be the grilled cheese.  What could be done to make a grilled cheese worth it you ask?  ohhh well... the bread has a flavored oil,  the cheese is good cheese,  it's covered in a delicious chutney like topping and omg... so good.  We'll just say after mine came out the table ordered 2 more.    They have had a couple bugs to work out,  but I trust at this point they will resolve.   The negatives would be portions are a bit small (it's all I hear about from my mom -  expensive for such small portions).   I see brunch to be a bit better for portions and dinner to basically require 2 plates per person.   So that's basically $30-40 pp so you know what you're in for.    I've been here with 3 omnivores that have enjoyed themselves but if your omnivore friends can't get over the menu they can visit the coal shed outside for all things bbqed meat.   The hours aren't overly long (I've still have never seen it open) but the vegetarians can sit at the window to look out at their carnivore buddies eating outside like savages - ha!  Actually....  there is a big old trolly outside White Rose that will become seating for the Coal Shed so they can be a but more civilized soon!    Anyway,  worth a go for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what plates the previous reviewers had that they thought were small portion sizes. I was very impressed by the size, the price, the service, and most of all the taste! The two of us (both card carrying meat eaters) shared only 3 plates ($12+12+18) and took about a third home with us! We had the scalloped potatoes with delicious Sylvan Star gouda, the Sweet Pepper and lentils with thai curry oil, and the cider glazed mushrooms, all so tasty and filling that we didn't miss the meat at all! In fact, my meat loving boy returned on his own the next week for lunch!  The place is also adorable by the way. Bowness is lucky to have this gem!"}
{"text":"Thoughtfully prepared and delicious offerings in a pleasant indoor/outdoor setting. They had me at elderflower/rhubarb kombucha and kept me smiling right through the house made carrot/raisin cake with candied carrot strips and creme anglaise."}
{"text":"Very very over priced - most dishes which consists of vegetables and rice or potato (being a vegetarian restaurant) are $18+! And they charge $2 per person for filtered water. The wait was long for the food to arrive despite the restaurant not full and the food did not come together for everyone at the table. Food is on the saltier side especially the portobello mushroom dish. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"On a visit to Calgary a friend took me to White Rose so we could try it for lunch. Located along a strip of road that looks like the Main Street of a small town the restaurant fits behind an old trolley car. The door opens to the bar and behind that is the kitchen. As you walk in to the left is the seating area with banquette seating running along the inside of the outside wall and a selection of small tables. The decor is an eclectic mix of elements including some really nice retro styled apothecary like pendants. The place was busy and the service attentive. We tried a couple of appetizers, the soup and the sweet potato, portabello Main. The food was good but it would have been nice if the options were a little smaller allowing for a more tapas like selection. If you are interested in vegetarian or vegan definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to White Rose Vegetarian Kitchen. The menu has a substantial amount of items to choose from and even though I'm not a vegetarian, I thought they all looked really interesting.  There is seafood on the menu for those who are not full vegetarian, as well as gluten free and vegan items if that suits your fancy.  Meat eaters don't fret, because White Rose also will let you order off of the Coal Shed Smokehouse menu until 8pm Tuesdays to Saturdays.  They only ask that when you make your reservation you indicate that you would like to order off both menus, so there are lots of great meat items if you're a carnivore as well.   We ordered the: -Eggplant -Risotto Cake -Mussels -Roasted Red Pepper Sage Cornbread -Double Chocolate Cake  All were very good and would recommend any of them.  My favorite were the Mussels, risotto cake and cornbread.  I'm not the biggest fan of eggplant, but that's not to say it was not prepared well; others in my party really enjoyed it.  The chocolate cake was neither bad or mind blowing, but still a nice way to finish off the meal.    The prices are moderate averaging $17-$22/entrée.    Our server was attentive and made some great recommendations.  All in all a wonderful experience and I would go again to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and service were all five out of five. I'm NOT a vegetarian but wanted to give the White Rose try and very glad I did.  The family style dining was a great way to discover several of their dishes."}
{"text":"Great place. Service was quick and friendly. We did not make reservations, the waitress found a table for us anyway but I could see that the place filled up pretty quickly. Next time (and we will go there again for sure) we will reserve a table beforehand.  About food. I ordered an eggplant dish, my husband had a salad and flat bread for starters. The portions were big, food was amazing, with a rich bouquet of spices and flavors.  Next time we will try their meat options from the meat shack. Or not, because it is easy to find a good steak or burger but difficult to see a great vegetarian restaurant.  It is on the pricey side but it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here....we went as 2 couples..so this place is about sharing?? Already not my idea of a good time.  We ordered 4 appies...2 soup...4 mains..3 deserts a few drinks and one coffee...the portions are not sharing size...we left feeling hungry and came home and ate!!  The place is really funky...antiques...and miss matched dishes...  All the dishes were tasty so no complaints about that at all.  Service was ok...servers kept bumping into the back my of my chair each time they passed...although I was as tight against the table as possible.  We had a groupon and  the bill was still over $150! I was a bit shocked actually that they could change so much for so little...and we all ate vegan so no expensive cheese, cream or meat on the plates..  Sorry folks won't be back. We could have bought a weeks of grocery for what we paid.  NEXT!!"}
