{"text":"I go to their monthly Back 2 Basics party often. It's always a good time! Friendly staff, great music and a funky space. I would definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"SO, I think it's pretty fair to say this was my first and last time coming to Studio Bar. Knowing that it was a small venue, I was looking forward to seeing one of my fave DJs in a small, intimate setting. Well, I was in for a rude awakening. There were so many things wrong, that I am going to list them.   1) The people. Like this is not exactly Studio Bar's fault/issue, HOWEVER, I still blame the venue because if they were a classy venue they would not attract such classless people. Everyone was super young, like what the hell, Im still young, but psshhh, the crowd looked like they just turned 19 yesterday OR stole their sibling's ID. They were dressed as if they were planning on volunteering to clean the city. I should just put \"Yes\" for the \"Good for Kids?\" question below.  2) So doors opened at 10. The opening act only came on after 12. Like really.  3) It was very hot that day, and either the AC was broken or it was nonexistent. It was a sweaty mess. Definitely a public health hazard, as people's spit and sweat was not being circulated. I honestly don't know how people didn't start to suffocate (unfortunately) due to lack of oxygen. And if you want to go outside to get some fresh air, you will be breathing in profuse amounts of smoke due to the sweaty people outside deciding that they have already picked up an STD inside and now it's time to get some lung cancer.  4)  So, who in the world is FJK? I don't know. it sounds like the DJ was lacking creativity and just changed the order of JFK. All the nuggets inside knew who FJK was, and I must be getting a little old because I don't know who he is? But I think it's just that I have good taste in music. Anyway, he was the opening act and I had to suffer through it because DARIUS was only getting off the plane at this point.  5) Darius came on after 2. Like the place closes at 2, and his act was finishing at 2:30. At this point, I was so exhausted I didn't even stay. I asked the girl at the front taking money for tickets who I have to speak with to potentially get a refund. She looked so distraught, I thought she was going to cry. She texted someone showing me that she called someone to discuss this with me, they came out, she left, then they left. I knocked at the door they went into. Of course no one came out. I would have been surprised if they did.   6)Just everything about Studio Bar. Even the bouncer told me the main act was on at one point when the in-between music was playing. Everything. Everything was wrong."}
{"text":"What a mess. Came here to See Darius play a DJ set on the weekend and the organization of the event and the event space was a DISASTER. Like Kids day at the Ex up in that.  First off, the crowd were a bunch of clownshows. Lots of shoving to get into the venue, there were like all these VIP hipster-bros that would bud in line to start talking to the door girl, which consequentially cut off ticket holders like me and a friend respectfully waiting to get in. If you are a hipster scum with a beard, entitlement issues and a big ego, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU. Also lots of jackass college kids with no manners or etiquette too. I got stepped on and danced on and spilled on throughout the night. And I was sitting in a corner of the venue...Away from people, and people STILL seemed to have no sense of space or consideration. Travesty. The crowd here was a frikkin joke GAWD.  They placed the ticket table in the NARROWEST part of the bar which created a lot of dumbass people traffic, hence all the shoving and HIPSTER BRO VIP Issues. We were second in line to get our tickets scanned and it took like 5 FLIPPING minutes to get into the space. What. The. Eff. Seriously the most absurd thing ever, especially to make people who paid for the event to get into the space before all the self-important self-aggrandizing hipsters. HONESTLY. The door girl was completely out of her depth too and had no control over who got in and went out and was probably overwhelmed by all the bros.  Dear Studio Bar, Please Hire me to be your door girl and I will slap the CARP outta those entitled trendy-bros, so that nice folks like me and my friend can come to your venue and enjoy ourselves a lovely evening of french house music, drinks, and possibly a little bit of polite dancing.  The place was a ridiculous swamp about a half hour into FKJ's set. Like, you could not breath and that shit could have been a health hazard because there was NO air movement or A/C, which is crazy because you basically bill yourself as an event space that features music acts that are...dancey. To not have any A/C or circulation is a joke and YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED STUDIO BAR. SHAME SHAME SHAME ON YOU. Drunk idiots+drunk idiots dancing themselves to dehydration=recipe for disaster. Studio Bar, are you home-owners? Because you should know better.  The floor was a mess of puddles, bar service was atrocious as well, we had to beg a bus boy who was practically running away from us to get TWO empty glasses for water from the pitcher.  AND, Darius was late due to a delayed flight. So instead of playing an hour and a half set, homeboy showed up at 2AM and played a half hour set. When we inquired with the door girl, very reasonable inquiring I promise, she basically had an emotional aneurysm, looked like she was about to cry and said \"she'll ask the owner\". Two minutes later she disappears and no owner is to be found.  Studio Bar. You suck at event planning. We left overwhelmingly disappointed about the evening and my faith in Toronto nightlife is wearing so so sooooo thin. Why must I cry, why must I cry, Why?"}
