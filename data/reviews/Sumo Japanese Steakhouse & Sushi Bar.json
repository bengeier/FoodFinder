{"text":"Went there last night for the first time.  Not impressed at all.  Sat in the sushi bar and it took a while to get attention.  Staff seemed overwhelmed.  Platters piled up on top of the sushi bar waiting for the waiters to carry them to the tables.  Sushi chef behind the bar yelling directions to the staff through a two-way radio.  Was a bit of a mad house.  Had the sushi boat for two and it is on par with supermarket sushi.  Not better.  No wasabi or ginger. They clearly have to still get their game together.  Until then, thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"We understand this place has not been open long but there were some things that could definitely use some help.   The first thing that we experienced was the manager (Sabrina maybe?) at the hostess station who seemed flustered and unprepared to receive customers. She was out at the station but was still taking off her coat and scarf and seemed to be stashing some sort of take out food under the hostess station. When she spoke to us, she was brusque and lacked any sort of warmth. Even when we told her that we had never been there all she offered as information was that they had general seating, hibachi seating, a sushi bar and a regular bar and asked us where we wanted to sit and then handed off a menu so she could take a call. Over all, this was something that kind of lowered our expectations for the experience  We elected to sit in the bar area as we were interested in dishes from two different parts of the menu. The bar top itself is VERY blue and lighted from underneath. Not a bad thing, just something that we weren't expecting. It wasn't really making our experience better since it was so bright so we moved to one of the granite top tables still in the bar area. Oddly enough, the stools/chairs for the granite tables are bolted to the floor so don't worry about scooting in to be closer to the table, you can't! For anyone who is larger, those chairs will not be comfortable because they are very narrow and just close enough to the table to not be comfortable. On the other hand, if you are smaller, still not a comfortable seating situation because you will be too far from the table if you sit in the chair instead of on the edge of it. We shared the Rum Volcano and the chair and table situation made that an interesting experience. The drink itself was very good, just hard to reach. The bartender (Lauren maybe?) was very sweet and took great care of us and mentioned that she takes great pride in her drinks.   Food was just meh. He had the Sumo Pineapple Fried Rice which was over and under seasoned all at the same time. It had way too much curry powder and turmeric in it, and not nearly enough salt, acid, or cumin in it. I would have even put some pineapple juice in it to help balance out the flavors. The shrimp in it were huge though so that was nice. I had the eel roll and the Alaska roll and the Nagiri octopus sushi. The eel had as many bones in it as I would expect from cheap grocery store sushi rather than a restaurant. The Alaska roll had very uneven distribution of ingredients which made the roll loose and a little difficult to eat. On the bright side, the fish was fresh and cold and did not have any off flavors to it at all.   At the end of the meal, we asked the hostess if there might be a comment card that we could fill out as we wanted to leave some feedback and we were told adamantly no and then she brushed us off. Instead, when we got our receipt, we wrote some notes on the back of it and handed it to her. Despite the fact that she was not busy (we waited to make sure she didn't have anyone to wait on) she took the notes with a huff and shoved them under the hostess station without even looking at them. The bartender, on the other hand, did listen to our comments and said that she would be happy to relay them to the staff and genuinely seemed to care about the feedback saying that it was important to get feedback to make the restaurant better since they are brand new.   It seems that the hostess/manager is the biggest let down of the establishment. The rest of it will just take some time to get in to the swing of things. As someone who cooks at home, I know how hard it is to get used to a new kitchen and new recipes and everything else.   We might be back to try again in about six months, although if the same person is the hostess we might just be walking straight back out, so who knows."}
{"text":"Oh man. After my girlfriend came here and highly recommended it, my hubby and I decided to chance it. We did not sit at the hibachi; instead we did the sit-down with the regular menu. There are so many options and the portions are not small!  We ordered coconut shrimp(delightful), the spider roll (large crab!  Need I say more?), and hubby got samurai steak and I got scallops. The servers are cheerful and have amazing customer service. The only pitfall was the noise level, but it's a busy restaurant, so if you don't mind the noise, you'll enjoy it. The ambiance is refreshing."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a place to replace Ginza of Tokyo for Teppanyaki and Sumo may fill the bill. Our daughter dined here last week and told us that it was good. We found the food at the \"hibachi\" tables to be well prepared and very tasty. I thought the price for their hibachi entrees to be very reasonable. I didn't look at their sushi or regular Japanese  menu so I don't know about their pricing for those entrees. This restaurant is located on the east side of Madison near East Towne Mall. The d√©cor is very nice and since it was built in the building that was a Old Country buffet very spacious as well. We were told that they had only been open for 3 weeks and if so they did a very good job."}
{"text":"Great portions of sushi for the price. Very unique decor and fun atmosphere. They have some unique rolls that I have not seen at other places. The Chicago roll and Hawaii roll were excellent!"}
{"text":"I had a chicken hibachi meal and my friend had the salmon. Food was ok, I may order the shrimp next time i go instead. It tasted a little better. The portions were decent and the chef was very funny, he had us laughing quite a bit. The atmosphere is really well done, you have to see it to know why. They could definitely get more hot tea on the menu. But I will go again for sure!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and it won't be our last. Monday night. Alex was an attentive waiter. I had the Tuna platter - 3 types of tuna (2 of each type)  & 5 huge spicy tuna rolls. We (2 of us) shared two dinners: beef roll (tons of onions) & orange chicken (soooo good), and the pineapple fried rice (very tropical tasting). Plenty extra to take home. Topped it off with the creme brulee. Yum!  Note: you can get the Hibachi food at a dining table without the \"show\"."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went to Sumo for our annual Christmas Party/Dinner... it was so much fun! Lorenzo was our hibachi chef and he was super funny and witty - kept us entertained! And, the food was so amazing - my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Portions were huge and we all ate our leftovers for lunch today, talking about how much fun we had. I had a delicious Sumo Sangria too. I look forward to bringing more of our friends and family back! Thanks for a great meal/experience!!"}
{"text":"The bartender was super sweet and very attentive. The food was tasty however. I ordered the sumo deluxe and I only received. My entree. No soup of salad.  I was offered if when I was paying my bill but it defeated the purpose."}
{"text":"First, nice remodel. Warm and inviting. Didn't venture into the hibachi area, so can't speak to that. We were seated right by the waiting area, which was a bit disappointing - it wasn't super busy but it was rather noisy and distracting.  Ordered the Sumo Deluxe, Black Dragon roll and Blue Crab roll.  Onion soup and the salad that came with the entree were tasty, especially the soup. Entree itself was delicious. Vegetables cooked perfectly, meat was tender. Could have used one or two more pieces of scallop. Had the fried rice for an extra dollar - wasn't impressed. Pretty tasteless and almost zero vegetable.  The rolls were very good, although the last bite of the Blue Crab roll really should have been cut. It's was literally 3 full bites."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for a friends birthday. Everything was awesome! Food service and the show were all impeccable. The prices are fair for all the food you get and the entertainment is a bonus. I'll definitely be back here soon. Great hibachi and the spicy tuna roll was also delicious."}
{"text":"So far this is a one star. Maybe it'll be updated.  We called about resos & were told they wouldn't take any for under 10 people.   While waiting I saw & heard people who had reservations for 4 & 6. So ok. I guess those numbers are bigger than 10.   We came here to celebrated a bday. Three of us. Just the core group. & were told that our wait would be an hour.    94 minutes later. After approaching hostess to check in at the 45 minute mark, I'm told it would be at least another 15.  While the  manager was looking at the list, I saw that two other 4 tops were seated before us although they were added to the waitlist after. I regret not taking a snap of it.   We're hungry. Crabby. Pissed off. & no one, gas apologized for the delay.   Every time  I went to talk to hostess either the hostess or the manager were fielding other's complaints about the same thing.   Highly unprofessional. Very rude. Non apologetic. The food better be amazing.  I've been here over 90 minutes. I'm. Not. Leaving. Without. Eating.     Rant over."}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise considering what was in this restaurant's place before. The hibachi experience was so much fun and entertaining, and all of the food was delicious. Bar service was on the slow side, but it was a Saturday night so I can forgive that especially since the cocktails we had were fantastic. Kind of pricey but the experience was worth it. Not sure if I'd say the same thing if I had just don't the \"restaurant\" portion."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for dinner tonight. We have gone to many hibachi restaurants. First it took the waiter about 10 minutes to acknowledge us and ask for drinks. We were in the hibachi section and there was 5 of us. We were sat in the middle of both grills. My mom and son got the best few of the cook. The cook cooked for the family of 5 next to us plus us. So we didn't even get a show. Just his back.   Our soup was cold, our fried rice was burnt, all of us had shrimp it was over cooked. The waiter never came to check to see if we needed more to drink. The vegetables were ok, the steak had no flavor. Again the waiter was no where around except to bring the bill, he remember the receipt and left My husband credit card in the machine. I never criticize but this place was just not worth the money. When there are other  Hibachi restaurants with better serve and food! Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Service and food was fantastic!  The bento box was MASSIVE! Easily the best deal on the menu. The spicy tuna roll was actually spicy for a change, which was refreshing. They basically overhauled and gutted the original building which was well needed. Prices are on par with what you would normally expect at a good sushi restaurant. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Sumo ever since we drove by it. We decided to give it a try Tuesday night. Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted by the sight of two giant sumo wrestler statues. The space is large with plenty of parking. We opted for the regular dinner versus the hibachi grill. Our hostess seated us and gave us menus.  We were pleasantly surprised to find out that Tuesday nights they have a special sushi and martini menu. The rolls, nigiri, and martinis were very reasonably priced. Our waitress came by with water and to take our drink order. The menu is pretty extensive so I needed more time before ordering when she returned.   When she eventually came back we ordered the Ladies Fingers (steamed okra), Grilled Squid, Mackerel and Scallop Nigiri, Sumo, Shrimp Tempura and Eel Rolls. The Ladies Fingers was a platter w/two rows of okra covered w/a tasty soy sauce. I really liked this dish -- pretty, the sauce was delicious, and I would order it again. The grilled squid was kind of hit and miss. It was a good sized squid, I would say about 9 inches, beautiful to look at, with a mildly spicy mayo. The tentacles and the end of the squid were very rubbery, hard to chew and impossible to cut with your fork. The middle was cooked perfectly - tender and flavorful. I preferred dipping the squid in the soy sauce on the okra versus the mayo which actually came with the squid. I kept my water-glass near the end of the table hoping it would be refilled and occasionally it was.  The sushi was pretty decent. The mackerel slices were on the small size but the scallops were larger. Both were fine. The Sumo and Shrimp Tempura rolls both had eight pieces. Their flavor was excellent. The eel roll was six pieces and I enjoyed it but not as much.  I really like that Sumo had some dishes I have not seen elsewhere such as the okra and the grilled squid. I also really liked the Tuesday night prices. The service while friendly was definitely a little lackluster. I would go back to try the Hibachi on a special occasion and I can imagine going back on a Tuesday for the specials but it won't become a regular for us."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of hibachi I had to try Sumo. Was not impressed, the chicken was average at best and the shrimp was awful. The fried rice had little flavor. Awful service as well. 4/10"}
{"text":"I went for the hibachi dinner for my birthday & had a chicken/rice/vegetable dinner. It was nice to watch the chefs cook in front of me & the atmosphere was nice. I wish the prices weren't so high though. Also, we could've had better seating at the hibachi station but the host chose to sit us (a party of 2) further from the chef. On the bright side, they sang happy birthday to me & got a free scoop of ice cream lol."}
{"text":"hi so we read a complaint on yelp about one of these certificate won't work and then we decided to go there and see if it worked so after eating we had to pay then at that moment we handed it to them it worked. so thank u and if your decide to come here it can work cause if it work for me then it will work for u and i love the food it was amazing love love love it the chef was funny i really want to see more of it. the place was amazing so clean and the staff was so nice love this place really would recommend it.   - selma.c"}
{"text":"Tried Sumo last week and I was pretty pleased. I tried a few of the sushi rolls and really enjoyed them. I got the Hollywood roll (avocado, crab, cucumber, and cream cheese), which was my favorite. I also tried the Chicken Tempura roll and the Sea Chicken roll, which were both good. The prices were really reasonable, especially for dinner. Sumo also has a good rice to ingredients ratio when it comes to their rolls. The service was a little weird as we were sitting at the bar and still had to order rolls with the help of our server. At other sushi restaurants I've been to, I typically get to order straight from the sushi chef when I sit at the bar (and the server takes my drink order). Other than that, no complaints. I'm excited to come back for the lunch special, which is pick three rolls (from a selected set of rolls) for $12.95. Very happy to have an affordable sushi place on my side of town."}
{"text":"Just got done dining here and felt compelled to write a review. The food is okay, but wasn't enough to compensate for the poor service we received. We asked for water (something so basic) multiple times and finally got it when we were halfway through our meals. The wait for utensils was also ridiculous. It wasnt even as if they had chopsticks at the table and we were waiting for forks. They had nothing. When our sushi came, we realized our soy sauce bottle was empty; took forever to get soy sauce. Asked for extra ginger when the sushi got there and it came at the end of our meal when there was nothing left to eat said ginger with. Service was poorly orchestrated & made what would have otherwise been a good meal, horrible.   Waitress brought over the check; must have then heard us complaining about the service because she brought ANOTHER check with 18% gratuity added and then proceeded to say we couldnt pay at the table and must pay up front, where no one was available to take our payment. Mind you, there was someone there -  they just couldn't take our payment. When we're about ready to just walk out, our server comes, we give her the check with no gratuity added and she still puts it through with gratuity. Whatever.   If you're hangry, this is not for you. The wait is ridiculous and who knows what order you'll receive anything in. Food is good; ultimately not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"The food was a huge disappointment. I ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box. You get an iceberg lettuce salad and some watered down soup with stale fried onions in it. The tempura had no crisp to it and was soaked in oil. The chicken teriyaki was a bit overcooked and tasteless. The sushi roll was unremarkable. The bowl of rice was the best thing on the plate. Service was good though and the food wasn't expensive. At least the place was decorated well."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant - my food was not very good, the blue crab sushi was very bready and the pad Thai smelled off, like the sauce was something premade full of chemicals. I'm never going back"}
{"text":"Horrible wait experience, even with reservations!  First off, I can't even rate the food because we never got to sit down and eat and had to go somewhere else for dinner.  We had a 4-top with reservations for hibachi at 6:30 last night. We get there and check in and the place is packed.  They were a little delayed so we were able to get drinks in the bar...thats fine, it happens to every restaurant. However, after about 30 min of waiting I check with the hostess and she says they are working on the table now.  We wait about another 15 minutes and still nothing, so we check in again. Another hostess/waitress helps us and notices we had been crossed off and they buzzed the wrong number...so someone else had gotten our spot and we werent even on the list. She takes us into the dining room to look for openings I presume, but then we are brought back out to the lobby to wait some more.  15 min later we check with the original hostess again and they hadn't even put us back on the list after realizing their error!  They offered to seat us at a regular dining table but it was still going to be a wait. They gave us a small gift card but otherwise didn't seem very apologetic.  I should mention many other customers that night were also experiencing big delays and seemed unhappy. We left Sumo and walked to a really great Indian food place nearby with amazing food and service, so the night was not lost.  We may try Sumo again but not on a busy night like that until they learn to manage a crowd."}
{"text":"Really Good sushi. Slightly overpriced. Kinda kitschy decor, including huge sumo statute. Service was slow. No wait to get in."}
{"text":"I've been here twice over the last few months.  For lunch I had the sashimi salad and some salmon sashimi.   My meal was kind of pricey because of what I ordered but it was really good.  For dinner I had the salmon bento box and shared a roll with my friend.  So.much.food!    It was really good quality and both times service was great.  We are going to go again soon and try the hibachi.   Nice additional option for sushi/Japanese food on the east side."}
{"text":"This new Japenese / Sushi / Hibachi style restaurant left us very unstaisfied for the high prices.  The food was all around just ok!  We have eaten amazing sushi all over the U.S. and this was a bit lack luster as there is many very good sushi places in Madison.  It was plated beautiful, rolled nice, cut well, but lacked taste and creativity.  We orderd a filet mignon hibachi dinner that came with veggies and rice for $30 after upgrades.  It was like 10 pieces of small cut up steak, $1.00 worth of fried rice and basically a pile of frozen veggies!  So my $30.00 meal looked like a $4.00 plate I could have done at my house my better.  I orderd the blue crab sushi which was pretty good (the only thing I liked all night).  The other one we tried, was not one we would order again.  It was some sweet chili, pinneapple cream cheese, crab????  Maybe poor choice on our part.   Regardless!  My daughter's honey chicken and fried rice was just ok as well. The inside of this place is designed very nice.  Looks clean and very classy on the inside.  Very clean and well kept bathrooms.  Nice hibachi style grills in main seating area.  Also lots of booths, bar seating, as well as private dining for larger groups or private parties!   Hard to find driveway to pull in.  We will give this place some time to get thier feet under them and try them again!"}
{"text":"First time here on Xmas.  So thrilled to have a great sushi place that also has a great full service bar and full Chinese menu.  Fancy rainbow was outstanding. Grilled squid app so fresh. Asked them to take the spice up a notch on curry and they delivered.  Spice catered to WI but i would ask for a little higher heat factor to take advantage of full flavor!  We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I grabbed some late night sushi and tempura and was not impressed. Though the atmosphere is very interesting, it wasn't enough to make up for everything else. The vegetable tempura was covered in panko and served with a sauce that tasted like fence dressing. And the sushi was very meh considering the price, both in presentation and taste. Red is definitely a better option if you want sushi with aesthetics."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic first experience with Sumo and having Hibachi. First, I'm allergic to fish and they took care of my plate in the kitchen. I'm usually not supposed be near fish when it's cooking, but they cooked it so quick and it was entertaining!   I had the Sumo Punch literally felt like I was back in the Bahamas it was refreshing.   I had the shrimp roll and crab rangoon. There wasabi was the bomb diggity!! Had me tearing up and clearing allllll the nasal passages.   The sexy sauce was delicious and creamy!! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Our group of eight were not impressed by the hibachi service. I suspect that there was a traveling group of chefs that opened this place to get good reviews and they moved on. Our cook gave a mediocre show at best and did not interact with any of our group. We did see other hibachi shows near us that were much better than ours. The food was actually pretty good but others in my group thought it was bland and flavorless. It was around 25 bucks for steak and scallops so the price was not too bad. This place was very crowed and can probably seat two hundred people at once if needed. Four hibachi bars seat twelve or so  and lots of big tables for the other types of service. When we were there on a Saturday there appeared to be only one bartender and she was trying desperately to keep up. They need more help there. I would say if you want to try it do it on a week night when it's hopefully not so busy. Maybe you will get the A team cook and see a good show rather that the bored B team guy we got. We would not rush back."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite restaurants to visit! We came here for lunch and were greeted by a welcoming hostess who took us to our table right away. Our friendly waitress came to our table shortly after and took our drink & appetizer orders. The restaurant is a newly remodeled place, and they did a spectacular job! Very beautiful and eclectic. The menu has something for everyone on it. I wanted to try everything lol....so many apps and different things to choose from. Our drinks and appetizers were very good. The presentation for both was beautiful. The main course for lunch was just as excellent and tasty!   I will be returning in about a month for my birthday party with a group of about 18 people. The hostess was very helpful in taking my reservations, and even recommended a private room for us. Looking forward to sharing this gem with my friends and having a good time at the hibachi dinner!"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls were a good value. At dinner, there were several rolls (6 pieces) that were only $6, which is a good price. The service was friendly. I plan to come back for the really good lunch special, which is 3 rolls from a predetermined list for $12.95 (Monday-Saturday). I tried the Crunchy, the Hollywood, and the Spicy Salmon. Their fish to rice ratio is really good. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Come here if you want to be entertained in a beautiful restaurant.  DO NOT come here if you want to enjoy delicious food and good service.  Food: Extremely bland food!  I went with a group of 8 so we were able to try and little bit of everything and all of their dishes were super lame.  The sushi was okay but nothing to brag about.  We had the Sumo Deluxe, Chicken Curry, Steak and Scallop Hibachi, Pineapple Fried Rice, Grilled Squid and more but all of the dishes tasted like canned or frozen Chinese food, seriously.  Their food was very disappointing and our entire party left unstatisfied.    Service: Our first impression when we arrived was walking past a filthy and trashed VIP room and when we left almost 2 hours later, it was still in its same state.  Maybe because we were a party of 8 and the server knew gratuity was guaranteed but our service was mediocre.  The server took 10 minutes to get us our hot tea and never attempted to clear away any of our empty dishes, they were piling up and it was a mess.  I can't speak for the Hibachi service since we were in one of the party rooms but the party room service was very mediocre.  Atmosphere: Beautiful Japanese themed restaurant with plenty of parking.  Brand new and modern facilities.  Interesting decorations create a fun and inviting experience.  Value: You're paying to be entertained and not for the food here.  Feel free to come here if you're looking to have fun and don't mind eating bland food.  A better value would've been a Trader Joe's frozen dinner and Netflix."}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch here and it was surprisingly great.  We had a nice quiet booth and good service.  I had the 3 roll lunch special and wasn't disappointed.  My friend had the seaweed salad and \"fancy rainbow roll\" that was beautiful and delicious.   Now I want to go back and have that myself. The restaurant is decorated very nicely and up to date.  Super lovely bathrooms - a nice surprise.  It's a little tricky to find, although just off East Washington Ave near East Towne, but well worth the effort."}
{"text":"Went here on Christmas because we didn't want to cook at home, and we were definitely impressed because we all ordered hibachi! I got lobster, filet mignon, and scallops cooked that way, and all $39 were worth it! In addition, there was soup, ginger salad, fried rice, vegetables, and an excellent entertainer cooking the food! He was very deft in his abilities and was funny (he made jokes about the food) and if you don't like cooking on Christmas, go here for yumminess!"}
{"text":"I never ate this food before but it was great and I will come back. Great expierence with habashi, sake was good, the rice and steak was great. Salad was good, soup taste good, our chef made great expierence. Manager made it a good time also. My group recommends this place"}
{"text":"Service was great let's start with the positive. Our server was super friendly! My daughter and I had the hibachi - so sweet! The sauce ruined the entire dish. Not like other hibachi I've ever had before. My husband got the Ramen - it tasted like it was out of a package."}
{"text":"I really cannot comment on the quality of sushi, because we never got past the really, really bad soup and appetizers, paid a bill we should not have and walked out. You might be able to get the Hometown Buffet out of the building, but I would rather have eaten there!!!  Do not waste your time at this sorry excuse for a sushi restaurant when one of the best in Madison is less than a 1/4 mile away."}
{"text":"I do not love this place as much as others, it is your standard issue mall hibachi grill located outside a mall in a family friendly environment. You can find similar quality at lower prices, or higher quality at similar prices, but if you're looking to keep a group of kids entertained, it's probably worth it. Most parents in my circle and their kids enjoy it. The biggest thing that turned me off is the ventilation. Hopefully they get this corrected fast, you walk out smelling like a hibachi grill. Me, I would much rather go to Takumi A few blocks down the road."}
{"text":"Offspring #2 and I recently popped in for some Hibachi fun!! Offspring is a veteran of this local establishment, but this was my maiden voyage!! I was a bit surprised as we walked into the somewhat kitchy entrance, as it felt like it was a detractor to the sweet idea of Hibachi. Once into the dining room, it was pretty sweet and we were seated at a ginormous table with a delightful young couple on a date night. Having no clue as to what to expect...I gleefully ordered a Sapporo and Hibachi Salmon, while Offspring ordered the Hibachi Shrimp. It was so cool to watch each step of preparation to the final product from our table-dedicated Chef! And I was in no way prepared at the expected participation of catching a flipped broccoli IN MY MOUTH! Say whaaaat???? Gasp...this was stepping waaaay out of my comfort zone but was fairly hysterical to Offspring. And of course, the first piece bounced off my face...just sweelllllll... After three attempts, and a lot of laughter, I gave up and so did the Chef (THANK GOSH!!!). Both shrimp and salmon dishes were fab, with half left over for lunch and I am most certainly coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This place hasn't been open for long, but has already become one of my favorites. My husband and I have been there 3 times so far and I've thoroughly enjoyed all three meals. Twice I've had the Sashimi Deluxe. I received rather large pieces of sashimi that were delicious. It also came with six California rolls, which were the best California rolls I think I have ever had. We were there when they had a night of free samples and  I tried their Chicago roll. Very good. My husband, who is an adamant sushi hater, even liked it! One time I was there I ordered their Scallops Teriyaki. I tried it because someone in a neighboring table had ordered it the previous time we were there and the smell was out of this world! The smell of it was so good that I had to go back to try it the following week and am very happy to report that the taste definitely lived up to the smell. All of our meals came with a small salad and soup, which were really good. I don't normally like soups, but I thoroughly enjoyed theirs. My husband's meals have been pretty good as well, although a bit on the small side. However, what it lacks in quantity for some of their menu items they make up in quality.  The only issue I have is that the service can be slow at times. However, the food has been so good that it's worth the little bit extra time we spent waiting for things.   The only thing I dislike about this restaurant is having to leave and wait to come back again. However, I will be back, again and again...Soon! :)"}
{"text":"Our first time there and we will be back the sushi was very cold and flavorful. The hibachi was tasty and the chief was engaging and skilled. Lunch prices were so affordable and you get a lot much food. So glad to see a great restaurant with good food and great prices."}
{"text":"On a whim we decided to try their sushi one night. Overall, the food was really good. They did put more sauce on the sushi than I personally care for, but that might have been the rolls we ordered. The fried scallops appetizer was awesome! I highly recommend it. We will definitely be back for the sushi and want to try the hibachi too."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place out when visiting a friend in Madison. It seemed to be one of the very few Sushi places in the city. It was very busy when we walked in but they got us in after about 15-20 minutes. When we sat down we ordered edamame right away and that got to us pretty quick. It was delicious (pretty hard to mess up edamame). My friend ordered chicken hibachi which came out pretty quick but my other friends and I's rolls took quite a while. We assumed the sushi bar was pretty backed up because of how busy it was. But the rolls were delicious!   I could tell our server couldn't understand everything we were saying but was pretty good still and attentive.   The restaurant had two areas, hibachi and regular restaurant.   Place GREAT for groups and families.  The space has great ambiance and has a very authentic feel. I will go again."}
{"text":"Honestly the BEST Hibachi place in Madison Football for sure!  I normally wait to write reviews but everything was great!  From hibachi to sushi, martini, and desserts! All was fantastic!!! I love it!!! Thanks for a wonderful experience!!!"}
{"text":"We had our doubts walking in hoping it wasn't yet another buffet and we were happy to be wrong!  Gone is any remnant of Hometown Buffet that previously filled that building.  The inside has been completely renovated and you wouldn't even know the building had once housed a buffet.  We weren't in the mood for full hibachi experience, but peeking there revealed several hibachi stations with chefs putting on the standard show for patrons.  Back at our booth, we were pleased with the menu offering hibachi meals, bento boxes and of course, sushi.  It was very much on par with other hibachi restaurants in the city.  Hubby had the pineapple fried rice which was actually served in a half a pineapple.  Very impressive looked.  He noted it did lack a little flavor but nothing that a little soy sauce couldn't solve.  Perhaps they serve it this way for less adventurous eaters.  I got a rainbow roll and tuna roll, both which were excellent.  Our table mates both had bento boxes which were huge and they both took home half their meals.  The staff was friendly and wanted to make sure we had a good experience.  This is a perfect addition to the East Towne area and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for my sisters birthday. Ben was our Hibachi Chef, he was funny and great! Our server was also very pleasant and made sure our drinks were always full. The food was amazing! Brought my daughter who isn't even one yet and they were very baby friendly and accommodating. Everyone we encountered was extremely nice and ginuwine. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The food is great each time and service is always on point. Hosts could use some customer service training but honestly I'll keep going back because the servers are great and the food has never disappointed me"}
{"text":"Ordered a hibachi meal and lots of sushi! Everything tasted great - nice that we were able to get good quality sushi especially when we are used to the number of great sushi places in the San Francisco/Bay Area. Nice job - waiter was also very engaging, sorry we did not catch his name.  We are just here for a few weeks but will definitely try to make another visit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The atmosphere, the people, the food...all exceeded my expectations by far.    Looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Probably the most awkward eating experience ever.  Our hibachi fella was the most unentertaining guy ever.   There was no clanking, yelling, flipping, or laughing going on at our table.  The food was edible at most.  Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Sumo opened less than a week ago, so I knew it was possible that my review might be a little more critical than if they had been running smoothly for several months. The good news is they seemed to shake off any early jitters and I had one of the best hibachi meals in Madison. Yes, the hibachi chef needed a little more practice, and the service was not quite 100%, but the food, atmosphere and overall experience will keep me coming back. We had two rolls to start the meal; a Sunshine and avocado. You must get the Sunshine. Not only delicious, it's presentation is one of the most unique I've seen for a sushi roll. We transitioned to the hibachi with our table getting all of the available options, with the exception of the lobster. Everything was cooked perfectly, and the sauce they use for the rice and scallops added a nice flavor, though I'll admit it looked a little strange coming out of their bottle. Drinks were impressive and with a bill of about $40 per person, very reasonable considering the appetizers and liquor.   They may just be starting up, but this place is worth a visit now."}
{"text":"We went with a group for lunch. For many it was the first time at a hibachi. All enjoyed. We were happy with the price and amount of food we received. Plan to go again soon."}
{"text":"Ate here with some friends from out of town and it was an overall decent experience! We came in on a Saturday night around 715, and were able to get sat in the dining room within about 25 minutes. The first thing I noticed was that the prices were very reasonable! I ordered a hibachi chicken dinner for $14.95 and it came with soup, salad, shrimp, fried rice, a large portion of saut√©ed vegetables, and chicken with teriyaki sauce. Their ginger sauce is AMAZING. They also have seemingly the best sliced ginger I've ever had at a sushi place. My friends all ordered sushi rolls and their selection of specialty rolls was impressive, as well as their classic and basic rolls. Our server seemed slightly overwhelmed and frazzled (not uncommon on a busy night), but was still friendly and made sure we got everything we needed!   Overall the atmosphere was great, and we had a lot of fun. We even made friends with the people in the booth next to us! They did a good job with the decor in keeping with the Sumo theme. I recently moved to Madison and this was my first time going out for sushi/hibachi, and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A disappointing visit, but worth another shot with different menu items.   We visited Sumo after my boyfriend received a very generous birthday coupon for $20 off the total dinner bill. We stopped in on a Thursday night and were able to get seating immediately. The decor is striking (especially the giant sumo wrestler statues when you enter) and the restaurant is unrecognizable from the building's former life as a buffet.   There's a takeout counter when you first enter, and then a host station a little farther in. Hibachi is toward the back of the restaurant, and \"regular\" dining is to the left. We chose regular dining.   Drink orders were taken promptly and overall service was good (minus one thing that we'll get to); my boyfriend's soda never went more than half empty, finished dishes were cleared quickly, and even little things like my straw paper were whisked away within a minute of placing it on the end of the table. Our server was kind and food came quickly after being ordered.   We ordered the crab rangoon appetizer and I placed an order for the chicken tempura dinner. I thought my boyfriend was ordering beef teriyaki but he ordered the chicken tempura as well. I almost changed my order to the orange chicken, and wish I had.   Dinners come with onion soup and a salad. The onion soup was okay; it was a good portion but for me it was too sweet and earthy. My boyfriend enjoyed it quite a bit, though. The salad was iceberg lettuce with a sweet mayo dressing and croutons. I did like the taste of the dressing, but the combo of iceberg and mayo was similar to coleslaw and I only had a couple of bites due to the sweetness. I didn't sample the crab rangoon, but they did look perfectly fried and the filling had some fresh herbs. My boyfriend had me try the dipping sauce, which he liked, but I didn't care for it. Both were definitely a step up from fast food delivery, though.   Soon our tempura arrived, and it was honestly comical. I was picturing rice, veggies, and some lightly breaded chicken pieces. What it was in actuality was a mountain of fried food in thick, crunchy, panko breading. The base was two large, thick slabs of panko-crusted sweet potato, plus an even bigger piece of panko-crusted white potato. There was a huge panko-crusted mushroom, five panko-crusted chicken strips stacked like firewood, and a large panko-crusted onion ring. Each plate also came with a bowl of rice and a small dish of the same sauce that came with the crab rangoon.   One tempura dinner would have made an okay appetizer for four people, but as an entree it was impossible to eat. Even my iron-stomached, non-picky, clean-plate-club boyfriend could only make it through half a sweet potato slice and two pieces of chicken before feeling ill from the grease and heavy crust. I was able to eat one chicken piece before my stomach started turning from the richness. I tried one bite of the sweet potato, but there was no discernible seasoning and the thickness of the cut made it a little more firm than I prefer.   I will say the chicken was good quality and if I had some spicy mustard to cut through the deep-fried goodness it would be a really tasty app. I would have asked for some, but once our entrees were delivered we didn't see our server again until we had been sitting for ten minutes and barely touching our plates. By then we decided to just get boxes (chopping up the chicken with some fresh veggies will probably make a good lunch) and go. And here we come back to the service point I mentioned - I wasn't asked if I enjoyed my food and no comment was made that I really hadn't eaten anything. I was just asked if we wanted dessert, then the check, and then we requested the boxes.   My boyfriend and I had already discussed that we wouldn't have asked to send it back since we did get what we asked for, and it was what the menu said; we just had different expectations that it would be a more balanced entree with some lighter/fresher elements rather than a jumbo pile of fried breading.   We noticed most people had sushi and it looked great; we may return and go that route, but we'll probably skip the entree section."}
{"text":"We had a great time and enjoyed our hibachi meals. The kiddos rank Herman as our best ever hibachi chef."}
{"text":"Been driving past here for almost a year, so I decided to finally stop in for dinner. It was a Saturday night, but my party of two was seated right away. I had the Rainbow roll, Alaskan roll, and Hollywood roll, and my father had the chicken hot pot. The rainbow roll was phenomenal with multiple flavors that made each bite unique. The Alaskan roll and the Hollywood roll were not all that special but enjoyable all the same. My fathers hotpot was the biggest surprise. When it came out, it looked very small and bland, but after a few bites it was anything but (the portion is very deceiving). Contrary to other reviewers, I had wonderful service with multiple visits from the staff for refills and dish clearing. Definitely will come back to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Hibachi is a favorite for our family, we were all delighted with our dinner.  Service was fast and friendly.  The chef was entertaining and interactive with the kids.  Most importantly the food was delicious!! We are excited to have a new place that we can frequent without a crazy wait time.  The only reason I gave four stars is that there was a patron that had very limited view of the grill at our table.  Watching the chef is a big part of the experience.  We will be back and next time I want to try some sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Went out for a girls night. We ordered the boat. They weren't kidding! So much food. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have amazing Hibachi and sushi, and even better cocktails! All of their employees are so friendly and inviting, and we cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really like the food, however I ordered the Sumo Pineapple Fried Rice with Shrimp, and got chicken instead. I did not complain, I was very hungry, and just wanted to eat. It wasn't a deal breaker. I'll go back again."}
{"text":"We were seated in a hibachi room, upon sitting down a mouse climbed up my sons chair. We shooed it away then it would not leave. We informed the staff and left.   Will never return."}
{"text":"I came with a large group to celebrate a school graduation of a friend. After a wonderful hibachi meal, I will be back soon. Herman was a great and entertaining hibachi chef who made the experience extra special. The fried rice was perfectly seasoned and had just the right amount of egg in it. I ordered filet mignon and chicken, both of which tasted excellent with the assortment of cooked vegetables. The lobster and scallops others in my party had were sensational as well. There was a wonderful variety of vegetables with the proteins, but the amount of onions was a bit high. The salad was good, but the star was the ginger dressing. I put some of the leftover dressing on my chicken, which wonderfully enhanced the flavor. The onion soup served prior to the hibachi show was just okay. The banana berry smoothie I ordered was fresh and had the ideal amount of fruit flavor. The kids with me enjoyed the large skinny glasses that the smoothies were served in, as well as the whipped cream on top. In addition, the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake was full of delicious raspberries and the chef even put sprinkles on for the occasion. I will definitely be back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"We tried the new hot sushi spot in town because it's right near the Sun Prairie theaters, we needed to be immediately seated and have a quick meal which they delivered.  The place is huge, very nice decor.  You would never know it used to be an Old Country Buffet.  We got the edamame (delicious!), Crazy Tuna roll- OUTSTANDING!! Get this item if you want pleasure in your mouth. Blue crab roll- pretty good.  And the cheaper/generic Alaskan roll. I would say skip these- they're mediocre and we know that going into it, so just skip it! But the price is right for only $5.75. Overall, inexpensive and delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So the big sumo wrestlers at the front entrance? You're gonna look just like that if you eat the hibachi here too often. The fried rice is full o' butter, salt, sesame seeds and other naughty goodness. It was the highlight of an already very good meal. Considering they haven't had their grand opening yet, that's saying a lot.  Sumo has taken a dingy Old Towne Buffet and turned the space into a really beautiful salute to Japanese style. It's modern and fun with tradition still in place. I can't even believe this is the same space. I mean, the floors aren't sticky and the lighting is great. Really well done.  We will be back to try the sushi. If you do hibachi at dinner, plan on taking home a box full of food for the next day. It still smelled delicious when we were bringing it in from the car."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, twice for hibachi and once for regular dinner. All 3 times I was more than impressed.   The hibachi chefs are friendly, and even if you only have a table of adults, they still put on a full show, which I can't say for every where. The prices are fairly standard, but I have to say that they give you more than most places, and the quality is high.   The dinner menu is varied and what we ordered was delicious. Husband got the pineapple fried rice, served in an actual pineapple, and he was pleased beyond belief. I got the chicken teriyaki bento box and was pleased with the flavors.   I've only had 2 of the sushi rolls, but I really liked both of them. I'll have to come back at a later point and focus on it."}
{"text":"Two visits, and I have only eaten here once.  This place has a line of people waiting to put their name down for a table, and I don't get it. The second time we went, we were seated at a table in the bar, and after 30 minutes, we walked out.  We watched staff avoid our gaze the entire time, I guess no one wanted to wait the table?    My first visit was a bit disappointing, as the food was flavorless, and everyone was served at different times.  We ordered various appetizers, and I got the bento box, while my BF got the ramen.  Nothing had flavor.  Changing out my sushi roll for a different roll of the same price was an up-charge of $1.50.  It's things like this that just make me not want to return.  I heard the hibachi is better, and that's the only way I would go back."}
{"text":"We had reservations for 11:30am on a Sunday for the Hibachi. Celebrating a birthday. We were seated right on time. Our party was ready. The service was hands down the best ever. Everyone was so attentive to me and my family. They came around with refills for the children when their cups were low. Was really impressed by the service and quality of the food. The hibachi cook was OUTSTANDING!! He really knew how to take customer service to another level. The children were entertained.   I ordered the fancy roll as well and had the volcano drink with my wife, but I think I drank most of it. Everything was delicious. Overall, we were there for about an hour and a half. The food was delicious and the entertainment was very good. I recommend visiting Sumo."}
{"text":"Thank you for being my favorite restaurant! Excellent food and service. Great prices. The sushi rice is consistent and always perfect! Thank you for accommodating my group on my birthday. I'm always looking forward to the next time that I get to come into Sumo."}
{"text":"Went on opening day,  loved this place,  definitely a plus for the east side. Their sushi lunch special is great!!!"}
{"text":"I got a \"gift certificate\" in the mail for this place. When I went to redeem it, they said it didn't count for anything we bought. I brought up my concerns with the manager, who was equally unfriendly and unaccommodating.  Beware of their shady, false advertising! Don't use their \"free\" gift certificates you get in the mail."}
{"text":"I immediately wanted to explore this restaurant when I knew that it was open! The restaurant is stations and beautiful. The appetizers were amazing! I especially loved the grilled squid. The sushi sampler also looks like a good deal. Our entree orders were also tasty. There were a lot of seafood going on the rolls. And you get really full if you try to finish the whole dish."}
{"text":"Food was terrific. There were issues with the grills and so it took a long time to actually get food but the food was great so I can't fairly take away a star."}
{"text":"Great service. Loved the bento box it was so much food! Environment was lovely as well."}
{"text":"Solid sushi restaurant at a reasonable price. Came for dinner. We tried two specialty rolls, the Blue Crab Roll and the Volcano roll. Both were very good and a large size. I'd probably prefer the Volcano over Blue Crab, but you can't go wrong with either.   The restaurant itself is very nice. Clean, interesting decor and a very friendly staff. The service was great! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our first visit here (Wednesday 12/27) had a very sour start as we were greeted by an extremely unfriendly and unprofessional manager. We let her know that we had a reservation at 6 for the hibachi grill (it was just a few minutes past) She tells us there will be a fifteen minute wait and we try to reiterate that we have a reservation. She rudely states that she is \"not even opening the reservation book yet as there are no tables open\" but says it'll be no more than 15 minutes until we are seated. We patiently wait and at 6:30 we have still not been seated but we do see a group that arrived a significant time after us get seated before us. We try to go up and ask about when it will be our turn and get cut off by the same manager who brushes us off and says \"yep, we're working on it.\" We do not get seated until 6:45 without even an acknowledgement or apology for the lengthy wait. The saving grace was the gentleman that cooked up our dinner. He was very friendly and entertaining and the food was great. We have been to hibachi grills before and understand that there is some strategy that goes into filling up the tables but a 45 minute wait is unreasonable, especially when we had done our part in making a reservation. The manager, who was dressed in a way-too casual grey sweatshirt, had glasses and  her hair in a bun, seemed to have no sense of customer service skills or how to respectfully speak to people."}
{"text":"I'm still on the hunt for a great hibachi restaurant. Ever since Ginza closed, nothing  has tasted nearly as good as their food.  Sumo was very busy last Friday night which to me is a good sign. It's very nice inside with I believe 9 hibachi tables. Service was extremely slow. We waited and waited just to get water. Our drinks arrived after being at the table for 30 minutes. The chef came out with the food cart and was having issues with the table so walked away and was gone for over 10 min with the food cart out. It was strange -- then he got it to work and started cooking. I wasn't impressed with the food. The 2 good things were the fried rice and the steak. The Chicago sushi roll was disgusting. My friend and I had to keep dunking it in all the sauces just to semi enjoy it. For $12, you'd think it would be a good roll but the \"crust\" on it was so hard and thick. Don't get that roll. We were there for over 2 hours. I wouldn't go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Saturday night. First time here. Daughter and I visiting hubby who's here for work. If you've never been to a place like this, you can choose the regular dining area or the hibachi area where they cook in front of you. You will sit with other strangers if your party is smaller.   Service: Greeted by host who was friendly. I couldn't understand her at first though. We waited around 30 min. Waiter, whose name I forgot was friendly as well. He kept making jokes with our table. It did take quite awhile after finishing our soup and salad before our hibachi chef came out. But he was also friendly! No complaints whatsoever with the staff. Though when we did leave, the ladies at the front watched us walk out and didn't say goodbye or thank you.   Food: Ok, I am part Filipino so I don't mind all the flavors used. I've been to Benihana and Shogun in California many times so I was expecting similar flavors. I ordered a rib eye dinner. It comes with onion soup, salad, fried rice, veggies, 2 shrimp and your main entree. We also ordered gyoza. Whatever dressing they used for the salad was delicious! Gyoza was good. I did not like the flavor of the fried rice. But everything else I ate tasted like soy sauce. I like soy sauce, but way over flavored with soy sauce. I ordered my steak medium well and it came out more on the well side. Which was fine. The dipping sauces were delicious. Basically tasted like the salad dressing. It helped to mellow out the soy sauce flavors.   Ambiance: Very cute place inside!!  I liked the place. My daughter has never been to a restaurant like this and she loved it. Though I do like the places in California better, this wasn't bad for Madison. It also wasn't ventilated enough inside but it wasn't unbearable. I wouldn't mind coming again and trying something new."}
{"text":"I love Hibatchi, but sadly Sumo did not live up to my expectations.  They really need more servers, as ours was spread very, very thin. Plus they really should have cooled the restaurant down more than they did. Everyone at our table was very overheated.  Our chef cooked ALL the proteins at the same time, and was not quick enough to avoid overdoing the shrimp and calamari. I've never seen a Hibatchi chef start all proteins at the same time, and now I understand why. Quality goes down for all.  The prices were decent, and Hibatchi dishes included fried rice. The ingredients seemed fresh, if only they were cooked properly.  To us, Sumo was just not worth the 30 minute car ride to eat dinner there."}
{"text":"We had dinner here opening night for a friends birthday. It was a group of us who had all been eager for the opening. The food was excellent and the wait staff were great!   There was a gentleman who was working, not sure if he was waitstaff or what but he was singing and really just making the experience great.   Our Hibachi chef was not the most entertaining. We had another family at our table that was not part of our group who had a younger boy and I thought the chef could have been a bit more interactive with him. We have visited other Hibachi restaurants in Madison often and the chefs are usually the most entertaining so we felt that they were lacking in that regard.   Overall the experience was good and the food was fantastic."}
