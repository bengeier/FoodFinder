{"text":"I really enjoyed the Oink French toast combo! The whipped cream, strawberries and blueberries, along with the drizzle make this plate!!! The staff here is amazing and very friendly! I enjoy coming here!"}
{"text":"Very good service,  good food. My only complaint is the loud echo of the room.  Seemed very noisy. Next time we'll bring our dog and sit outside."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  We have been lucky enough to have Jasmen as our server every time we come, she is always so sweet and makes it a great experience.   The flight of Bloody Mary's and bacon are absolutely delicious.  This is definitely one of our favorite brunch places!"}
{"text":"Nothing really special other than loads of bacons, nothing's really terrible either. I'd consider as an less carb -loaded version of places like Crackers. Things are on the $ side also."}
{"text":"So excited to go here but fell short food and service was average bacon was ok don't think I will go again though"}
{"text":"Bacon was outstanding as were our food orders. However, don't order the hash browns. They tasted like old grease and were greasy. Pancakes, sausage and eggs were great. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We have been there twice and not impressed. Service was slow and overall menu is overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! Bacon flights. Bloody Mary flights. Mimosa flights. Beer on tap! Amazing food, huge portions. I had the chimi, my husband had the bacon eggs Benedict. Both were excellent. Very friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time ! ... I waited over ten minutes to place a to go order and the staff couldn't be bothered to acknowledge me / take my order."}
{"text":"All kinds of complaints for this place. Can't say there's a single thing that is worth mentioning as a positive. First visit and first impression is poor service. When we were seated menus were given but not asked if we'd been in before. We have not. Not being familiar with the menu nothing was explained or even suggested. The server left and came back with our waters. In short time we ordered our food but was not asked if we'd like anything to drink besides water. We ordered the turkey sandwich and Cobb salad to share. We had to inquire to another server status of our order. We had waited a long time for one sandwich and a salad. There was not many? people in the restaurant. When our order arrived no extra plates so had to ask. The food was tasteless especially the turkey sandwich, very dry and boring. The Cobb salad was a joke with the side of bacon being two strips not chopped. Really? Not impressed and will not be coming back. If there's one thing you must learn in the food and service business to be successful have a variety of beer selection."}
{"text":"First time here and I will be back.  Good service, nicely decorated and very clean.  All the food was very good but two things make this place special.  

1 - the owners.  They were working the floor, clearing tables, refilling drinks, delivering food, greeting guests.  You could tell they take pride in what they built and want to make it feel like you're a guest at their kitchen table.  

2 - the Ranchero Chimi...big enough to share but so good you don't want to.  The pork, ranchero beans and home fries wrapped in a perfectly fried tortilla covered in a chorizo cheese sauce...excellent.  Never had anything like it but will be going back for it for sure!"}
{"text":"Biscuits were amazing. Server was very sweet. However, wait time on food was very long.  I plan to come back when the kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"I've been to Oink Cafe on warner quite a few times, the food is good but the service is so bad that I won't be returning. The hostesses don't welcome you, no smiling faces when you enter the restaurant. Then the waitresses are short with you and rush you through your meal. I've only interacted with 1 waitress who was exceptionally nice but she wasn't even serving our table. Not sure why the staff seems so unhappy but it totally takes away from the food. I'll find a new breakfast/brunch spot"}
{"text":"Coming from a worldwide FOODIE who is also comes from a 3rd generation german family of pig farmers this establishment offers some of the best BACON and BACON dishes I have found!!! SERIOUSLY happy to share that if you are a BACON lover you MUST come indulge in their PORK goodness!!!"}
{"text":"Waited 50 minutes when quoted 20-25.  Prompt response when seated but after got our coffee we had nothing to stir with.  Took a few moments to flag someone down for silverware.  Food was ordinary.  Would not go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"This place only serves breakfast and lunch and closes at 2:00pm.  We decided to check out this place for lunch after we heard about it taking over the Marcello's space (which we miss!).  First of all, the place is now painted lime green and yellow - everywhere - even the booths are lime green.  So it's very BRIGHT!  If you like or love bacon, then this could be your place.  I'm OK with bacon, but I don't care for it on everything.  Overall the food was OK, not great, the service was adequate but you can find better lunch places elsewhere.  I had the strawberry chicken salad, my husband had the cuban sandwich w/ a side of beans and our son had the grilled cheese w/ fries.  The grilled cheese was OK, but you had to pay extra for tomato & bacon on it.  The fries were average, a little limp on the big ones.  The salad was good.  My husband likes spicy mustard, but he said they put so much on it that it overwhelmed the sandwich - so if you order it, I would suggest asking for them to lighten up the mustard.  His side of beans was also very spicy.  He thought they were OK, but he's had better.  They also serve beer, bloody mary's and mimosas.

Overal it was OK, but I wouldn't go out of my way again for this lunch."}
{"text":"So bomb. They have a BACON SAMPLER. Do I need to say more? Excited to try the mimosa sampler next time. Really good service as well."}
{"text":"Love this place. Waffles are delicious with a hint of cinnamon, honey bacon and latte are my faves. My husband highly recommends the  California Mac n cheese. Ask for Cassidy she's just simply awesome"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but it was rather disappointing.   The food was fine, but rather ordinary; certainly nothing special.  
Most problematic was the noise - the place seems like an echo-chamber!  We struggled to have any kind of conversation at all!
Also the bacon was pretty disappointing.  For a place that has bacon in the name, I'd expect a more hearty slice.  I was served two really thin slices."}
{"text":"I had the Oink omelette and a half flight of bacon with a shot of espresso this morning. Everything tasted great, good portions. I would recommend a side of salsa (which I had). Service was excellent- thanks Jenn! I'll be back"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and so is the service! Their mimosa flights are a must, they come in four different flavors for only $11. I had the Sunrise Benedict and substituted the toasted muffin for salad greens for a lighter option. Friends had the Biscuits & Gravy."}
{"text":"What a delightful restaurant! The bacon flight is a must-do (if you just go for a half-flight, I recommend peppered, hickory smoked, pecan smoked, and jalapeño). I ordered the bacon and spinach omelet and a biscuit. Both were terrific. 
It was nice to see a packed house. The restaurant that used to occupy this space was never on a wait list."}
{"text":"We live right down the street so when we saw a new breakfast place coming in we were pretty excited. 
We finally got the chance to try it this week and it was okay. Their food was fairly good... but definitely nothing out of the ordinary - like we won't be dying to come back anytime soon. I did have their jalapeño bacon though and that was very good! 
We didn't have any service for the first 10 minutes we sat at our table, but as soon as we did service was great. 
Pricing isn't the best. $8 for their signature Bloody Mary and it was nothing special at all. 
Their decor is awful... neon green and brown! Huh?? But that has nothing to do with their food - Just the overall ambience we didn't care for. 
All in all... it wasn't bad food just nothing special. We may come back someday if we are dying to eat out for breakfast and don't want to drive far."}
{"text":"Tried going to this place a couple different times but each time was a crazy wait. I had heard great things so I was determined to wait the third time no matter how long it was. Luckily when we walked in we were pleasantly greeted and were able to sit right away, up at the bar (which I prefer). We went in around 11:30 on a Sunday (it's my only day off so I know it's going to be busy) and was greeted by Jasmen. She was very busy when we sat so we just ordered waters and looked at the menu until she caught up on her tickets. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and made the drinks look enticing. I ordered the mimosa flight with four different fresh juices, yum!!!! To eat I ordered the chorizo with green chili Eggs Benedict and my bf ordered the tuna sandwich. I devoured my food, it was delicious! I tried my bf's tuna and it was very light, tasty, and fresh. The only downside was that there was no drink menu or music, but I will be back to try the Bloody Mary flight and have that Benedict again!"}
{"text":"There's usually a long wait here, so we were excited to be able to get sat this time. But then we sat for about 15 minutes and ended up walking out because no one had greeted or even acknowledged us. There was one server in particular who I'm almost positive was our server, she had long brown hair and a darker skin tone. She looked in our direction and passed us about 5 times before we got up and left. I'm a server as well so I am usually more understanding when a restaurant gets busy. But this was unacceptable, to not even be acknowledged was extremely irritating.  On top of our server neglecting us, (and I know she saw us because she was serving the table right next to us about 3 feet away) I heard her say \"I'm going to kill everyone\" as she once again passed us without greeting us. Definitely unprofessional. So so disappointed in this experience since we had only heard great things and had higher expectations and couldn't wait to try it out. But now I'm hesitant to give it another chance and probably won't come back to try it out..."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience here. Brought my niece and nephew (toddlers) and the waiter forgot to put in our order. We waited over an hour for our food while everyone else around us got their food. Food was not that great. Bacon was okay. Overpriced."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. The mimosas were spectacular. Bring a designated driver. If you're a bacon lover you have to try the bacon flight. The food was fantastic here. We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Have tried The Oink Cafe three times in the past month with mixed success. I have zero complaints about the entrees. All three times it arrived hot and tasty. We got two of the bacon topped donuts to go because they looked amazing, but they were truly horrible. Took two bites and trashed the rest. 
The hostess I had today seemed to be in a fowl mood. Ignored us when we first came in. She seemed more interested in whatever she was working on at the podium. Finally said a total of one word, \"2?\" Then we waited about 15 minutes before a waitress came around and it was not busy. She was sweet and helpful once she got to us. On my second visit the waitress seemed to have way too many tables or something. She did get our order in and was very pleasant but then we didn't see her again. The manager was there thankfully and stepped in and got our bill. I think Oink really needs to work on customer service. Not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"Had such high hopes, as this is a new restaurant in my neighborhood. I've been there three times, really wanting to love, or even like, this place!  Each time I leave thinking I could have gotten a better meal at Dennys. Decor is atrocious, almost hard to sit in. For a restaurant who's name is bacon, the bacon was nothing I couldn't get at the local grocery store, disappointing. Had the Bloody Mary flight, again disappointing. The worst thing of all is the noise. It is SO loud in there!!!!  Again, hard to sit in. Extremely distracting & couldn't wait to get out of there!!!  I have high hopes they read reviews and make some changes as this area is in desperate need of a good neighborhood eatery!!"}
{"text":"My 5th visit to The Oink Cafe and they continue to impress me. The wait and the bar staff are always helpful and friendly. My food has always been served hot with great presentation and flavor. If you haven't tried their flights of mimosas or Bloody Marys, then you have to give it a go."}
{"text":"One word.  Overrated.  We came on Mother's Day and I would expect them to be busy as they were.  We were smart enough to have made reservations and were seated promptly however the kitchen was overwhelmed by the amount of orders.  Our server, while polite, blamed the issue on an order system outage and then further complained that the 18 top and 15 top that were there were really slowing things down. In all, it took us an hour and a half to be served our food. To make up for the delay, we were offered a donut to split among the 4 of us. Would be great if I wasn't on a diet and the tuna sandwich and salad I did finally receive was dry and tasted as if the tuna was a day old.  

My party ordered the bacon flight.  8 pieces of bacon for $10.99.  I can buy a pound of bacon, good bacon, in the store for $6 so I don't what is so special about this particular grouping but it's was the first recommendation out of our server's mouth so they must push it as a high profit item.

I get the appeal as a niche breakfast place but a 90 minute wait for food, even on a holiday is something that no restaurant should ever be known for."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast!! It does have a long wait on a Sunday but well worth it. They explained they have mimosa, bloody marry and bacon flights. Hubby got the chimichanga breakfast I got eggs breakfast. Everything was delicious. We will be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"We loved the bright and fun environment of Oink. Everyone is very friendly and the variety of flights and Bloody Mary's were a fun surprise and the biscuits were delicious, highly recommend. Most of the food was very good, but the ranchero sauce on the Tempe omelet was a little heavy handed and overpowered the flavor of the entire dish. I'm rating three stars primarily due to the poor service. There were many times that the server forgot to bring things requested and got part of our order wrong. It also took 15 minutes to get our Bloody Marys. Usually I would understand the delay, but the restaurant didn't seem too busy when we were here and typically Bloodys have a pre-made mix. Perhaps our server was slow to put in the order? I got the sense that she may have been distracted, so maybe it was just a bad day. Overall this is a super fun restaurant and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food and Bloody Mary flights were so good. Your booths are way too thin and I could feel the people behind me. I suggest fixing that as it actually hurt my back throughout eating."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! I had the bacon Benedict with jalapeño bacon. My son had pigs in a blanket. He said they were 10 stars. The home fries come with grilled peppers and onions, so much flavor..... service was great. Get in there before the word is out or you'll be waiting for a table.

New south Tempe favorite."}
{"text":"Breakfast:
One word \"uninspired\"
We visited on the 4th of July morning, the place was definitely not busy but not empty either.
We decided to not go for the specialties and go for tried and true breakfast classics. Can't go wrong with those right? Right?

Omelette was ok, nothing amazing. Home fries were, I kid you not, overcooked to hell and back. They were crunchy...or rather hard...the brown color right before they start turning into lumps of wood and about the same consistency. The biscuit was very obviously not made in house.

The pancakes were decent but kinda ruined by cheap syrup with no option to get real maple syrup. The bacon which is their pride and joy while good in flavor was cooked to a chewy/hard consistency, the worst option neither chewy nor crunchy which is is what most people prefer.

Service was equally disappointing. Our water glasses sat empty for the vast majority of the meal.

Considering the menu prices, this was a rather disappointing experience and I don't think we'll be returning considering there are an abundance of alternatives."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service ... bloody Mary's are amazing and food is excellent !! Best omelette ever"}
{"text":"It's a cozy dining room with bright colors. Kaitlyn is one of the reasons I come back here!  She is the best waitress on the floor! Friendly, professional, and helpful! I really enjoyed the classic Bloody Mary that I ask for extra spicy 
I got the waffle combo but I don't eat meat so I just get an extra scrambled egg with no problem!! 
The only downside is it takes a while to get your food. I feel like there's only one cook. Food should never be luke warm when you get it.  I don't complain because I'm usually with good company so I don't really notice how long its been until the food actually arrives.
The staff is friendly & the food is good!
There are some improvements that could be made but over all its a nice clean place to eat!"}
{"text":"Randomly stopped by after church this last weekend. We had a good breakfast, after about a 30 minute wait. The food was good - nothing over the top though. Very standard menu with the exception of the bacon flights. The waitstaff was friendly, and the food came out promptly. My fiancé did try one of the bacon flights, but we were a bit disappointed with the lack of different tastes between the 4 that were chosen. Other than that, we had a good experience, and they have adorable coffee mugs."}
{"text":"I love OINK!!!! Real food! You can tell that the owner loves his place. Very nice employees. Well staffed. Real pancakes, not fluff. No skimping on quality."}
{"text":"Great Mother's Day breakfast at Oink! We had a large party and they went above and beyond to make it work for us. Bacon flight is a must do!"}
{"text":"I was somewhat underwhelmed. Nothing was bad at all. But if you call yourself oink you should do something better than normal with pork. The bacon was good but it was bacon. Nothing special about it and 10$ for 8 pieces. I was looking for some hidden meat magic and left having seen none."}
{"text":"Try their bacon flight before your meal so you know exactly what kind of bacon you want in your meal!"}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful experience at The Oink! First the service was superior. Taylor was knowledgeable, kind and didn't rush us. The Assistant GM is making sure everyone is pleased and he's working and helping the staff! They really care about the community! The food is worth the money. If you're looking for Denny's slop  or IHOP's fake over sweet, cheap and over processed foods. Then this isn't the place for you. If you're looking for high quality fruit, eggs, pork, veggies and protein. This is your place. Also their beverages are amazing. We ordered a couple flights of mimosas and bloody Mary's, great! But the kids ordered cranberry juice and they brought out a small carafes of juice! Two times! My only suggestion is the mimosas need to be chilled. I had to add Ice. If the juice, 
Sparkling wine would have been chilled and then served chilled glasses that would have been the topping to the cake. The price is worth it and super good for the mimosa and bloody Mary's. Will be back again, worth the wait, price and the service!"}
{"text":"Love it! The Oink Omelette is HUGE and it is GOOD. 
All of their food has been awesome. My kids loved the pancakes ( they are also huge ) and the maple - bacon donut is a big hit, too. 
This is a great addition to the neighborhood. Comfortable feel, nice little bar, friendly staff, etc. Speaking of the bar, they have a bacon bloody Mary that you really should try.
They are only open for breakfast and lunch, no dinner. 
Did I mention bacon? Yeah, lots of bacon.
I'm in love..."}
{"text":"This place was OK, but I'd say more on the 2.5 stars.

The interior decor (or better said, that hideous green paint job) is jarring and so is all that lighting, so already walking in I'm irritated :\

Our server was warm and nice and all...
My dish was not attractive nor enticing... just a big pile of what look like eggs and chorizo thrown in a blender and then cooked in a huge pile on my plate.  The potatoes looked delicious and tasted good.. but the egg/chorizo mess was not appealing... I wish I could've ordered them a different way so it would not look that way.  ANyway, I enjoyed my bacon at least!

My husband's dish was kind of the same .. big blob of eggs, not very appetizing. 

I love the concept of a bacon-centered restaurant because I LOVE BACON and all things PIGGY but I think there is a lot of room for improvement at this place.. first off with the interior environment and the presentation of the food.. that alone would make a huge difference!"}
{"text":"I see what they were trying to do here for the bacon enthusiast, but they missed the mark slightly. Great idea with potential, but they need Jon Taffer for a restaurant rescue."}
{"text":"Run of the mill breakfast joint. Overpriced food and very slow service. We won't eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is uber cool.  Granted when I walked in ...it was very bright.  We ordered a flight of bacon.  Do this first... you get to sample all the flavors so then you can choose the right bacon to go in your dish.  I am from NM and got a chicken sandwich.... i dont remember the name but it was DELICIOUSNESS... grilled chicken breast jalapeño bacon, pepper jack cheese, cheese on some tellura roll/bun.  Had a side of sweet potatoe fries..had lots to choose from for food and sides.  Everyone in my little group was very happy and are going back with their families.  Can't wait.  Well done Oink!"}
{"text":"From out of town, wanted to try something new for breakfast/brunch.....the cafe name caught my attention. I had the Huevos Rancheros with Chorizo and wife had Denve Omelette....both were totally awesome.  Also got the flight of bacon to try, glad I did."}
{"text":"Ok.  We did have a long wait,  but it was well worth it! And the service was great,  so we didn't mind. 
The. Bacon. Is. Amazing! I liked all of the flavors... and tried all of them :)
We also shared the Oink Omelet and it was huge..and delicious. Tons of cheese and meat.
I opted to have the sweet potato fries with the meal and wow! So tasty. 
Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just happened to drive by this place and decided to give it a try.  With a name like \"The Oink\" how could we go wrong.  As soon as we walked we could smell the pleasant aroma of bacon. The hostess was very polite as well as our waitress.  The food was very good. It had a home cooked look and taste to it.  There are a lot of items on the menu that caught our eye so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place,  especially for the bacon.  We ordered a flight of bacon,  cafe mochas, a bacon donut and a cinnamon roll.  The waitress brought out the roll first and told us there weren't any donuts and they couldn't make the mochas either.  Then started to walk away.  Ummm..... didn't even ask if I wanted anything else and didn't bother to bring silverware either.  I stopped her and had to ask for regular coffee and the silverware so my hubby could at least eat.  The tool was just ok.We sat waiting for a very long time and the waitress asked if we wanted anything else.  I had to remind her we never got our flight of bacon. She finally brought the bacon and there was a slip telling what each was but they were not in the order according to the slip. Bacon didn't even have that much flavor. Not impressed with this place at all."}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G ! Get the bacon flight!!! No matter what. It's seriously so good. All the bacon is great. I also got a waffle which was cooked perfectly. Crispy, golden and delicious. I will absolutley be back."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow and staff was inattentive. While waiting 45 minutes for our food, restaurant was less than 1/2 full, we had to ask several times for a simple spoon for our coffee. We finally got one after my wife went back to the service station and got it herself. First and last time trying this place. And food finally came. Judge for yourself from the photo."}
{"text":"It's BACON!!!!! Seriously... I mean it's bacon, you can't go wrong.  These guys take bacon and amp it up a notch with a variety of flavors.  You can even order a sampler of bacons.  Thank you bacon God's, you have blessed us with your presence and we accept!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place. Seen this location in passing more than a few times. The wait time was a little long but sooo worth it. All or dishes were cooked to perfection. I would recommend the 'flight of bacon' if you're feeling extra hungry"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in their BLT sandwich, especially for a restaurant that specializes is bacon.  The applewood bacon was thick and tough and I could barely chew it, I think had been cooked hours before being served. If you spend over $10.00 on a sandwich I would expect they would season the tomatoes use descent bread and adequate mayo, this sandwich had none of these elements. Not to mention the unprofessional unfriendly hostess and the bright lemon and lime yellow paint!"}
{"text":"Two words: BACON FLIGHT. They offer 8 kinds - my favorite are the Jalapeño and Applewood...and of course, their freshly made MAPLE BACON DONUT HOLES - it's the perfect sweet, savory, crunchy deliciousness your life needs now! If that doesn't lure you in, another must try is their ARIZONA OMELET with chorizo and their house made RANCHERO SAUCE, which tastes incredible on everything. What can I say? I'm a fan. Oink had great service, food, ambience, Mimosas, Bloody Mary's, Coffee and much more! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Oink Cafe in Tempe is amazing! Our server, Rachel, was so attentive and nice! Ordered the half flight of bacon and devoured every bite along with my meal. They have a bunch of different types of bacon here. I will frequent this location because of the great service my party received!"}
{"text":"I love this breakfast place. Delicious Bloody Mary and definitely never a long line. Great service and food."}
{"text":"Met some friends here at 8:30 on a Sat morning. (Tip: get here before 9:00 or expect a long wait.)
They are very good at your basic breakfast.  Our group had eggs benedict (two thumbs up from our buddies), Denver omelet (excellent), & veggie omelet (excellent).  
The coffee kept coming with refills & ditto our water glasses.  Big plus!
We noticed a bar area and I think they offered bloody marys but that was too early for us.
This place is on our \"return\" list and not all restaurants make the grade.
(Tip: If there are more than 4 in your group you might call to get a reservation; although I don't know if they take them.)
There is no outdoor seating.  However, based on their popularity I'll bet they will have some in the future.
There is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate breakfast at Oink this past Saturday morning. I was greeted by a lovely hostess who immediately seated me while I waited for my friend to arrive.
The owner stopped by our booth and introduced himself and made us feel very welcomed. Our server Jenn, was there on the spot and ready to take our order. We needed a few minutes, she gladly came back and took our order when we were ready. We had the breakfast special and it was fantastic. our eggs were done perfectly, the hash browns were perfect and the bacon! Well, the bacon was just plain out of this world. I was raised in the mid west and had not eaten bacon that good in quite some time. The only issue was choosing which kind of bacon to have. My friend and I both got different kinds ( honey and hickory), both outstanding. After we paid our check, our fantastic server, the owner and the hostess all thanked us and wished us well.
This is a definite must stop for breakfast if you are in the Tempe area.
I would suggest to get there as early as possible, the food is so good this place will fill up fast!
We cannot wait to go back.
Great job Oink!"}
{"text":"Save your bacon aspirations for another day. I was so excited to try oink after a friend told me about a place in Tempe with bacon and mimosa flights. Let's start with the good, the mimosas were well proportioned, the server was sweet, and the place looked clean. Now for reality, the server took 20 minutes to ask us if we wanted a menu and clean the area, when sitting at the breakfast bar. The bacon was thin and overrated. The mimosas were Cupcake Sparkling wine mixed with Tropicana style juice (not fresh in the slightest). They were good but definitely not unique. We had 2 types of Benedict and the hollandaise sauce was so buttery I could not even taste the bacon. Lastly, our pancake was cold and over cooked. I would not recommend oink. This place is below par on so many levels. I recommend the owner change the name to IHOP or Dennys because the quality of food is standard to a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect stop for a delicious brunch, any place with bacon in the name is bound to have high expectations and The Oink Cafe did not disappoint! My fiancée and I enjoyed the breakfast chimi and not only was this thing massive, it was to die for!! Perfectly crisp on the outside, as any chimichanga should be, and on the inside the most tender and crispy pork confit (that's fancy for carnitas), and if that is not enough to seduce any palate the whole thing was smothered in a sinfully rich chorizo cheese sauce... heaven!! The service was great, and the manager and his wife were the perfect hosts! We would move to Arizona just to be closer to this cafe! Until next time Oink Cafe, you will be in our food dreams! 

-smiley"}
{"text":"Waitress was nice and food was pretty good, but we waited for 30 min to get a table even though there were multiple open tables, the staff had just neglected to clean them. Also, we ordered and sat at our table for an additional 30 min before getting our food and had no drink refills or interaction with our server. This was all annoying, but the low rating is mainly because servers were arguing in plain site and the wait staff as a whole was quite rude and unwelcoming. Probably will never go here again."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Burger joint. Lots of bacon related stuff. I had the Oink Burger. It was a Decent burger. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Excellent for breakfast or lunch.....try the flight of bacon..8 flavors of bacon.  Or flight of mimosas"}
{"text":"Oink oink. 

I like The Oink Cafe. I've been here at least three times now and I'm always happy with the Bloody Mary flight, the Oink Chimichanga, and their biscuits. The mimosa flight is decent and the bacon flight is more of a novelty than anything. Service here is prompt and friendly and the restaurant is clean. I'm never upset getting food here and I'll probably be back soon for more Bloody Marys... especially the Verde Mary."}
{"text":"I know I'm probably going to LOVE a place that offers bacon flights!

I was not mistaken! The place is extremely popular on the weekends for a very good reason. The food is great and the service is stellar. 

I have been to Oink about a dozen times now and I can also say the quality of the food and the service had always been excellent.

My wife loves the 50/50 burger and I am a huge fan of their BLT (without the middle slice of bread add avocado!).

It's worth the wait on a weekend or hey; just get there early! They open at 7am and make awesome bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday when I was craving some breakfast food. I heard they had Bloody Mary's so I gave it a try. The bar was busy and didn't have any seats but the bartender noticed me right away and got me a drink while I waited for a seat. The manager noticed I was dining alone so she sat me really quickly. The food was delicious. I really enjoyed the bacon flight. My eggs were perfect and they checked on me frequently. I can't wait to go back this weekend!"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch with a unique menu.  
They offer different bacon flights, with 8 different flavors total. You're able to create a flight with all 8, half or even just just two. They also offer flights of beer or mimosa. 
Unfortunately I did not order those things during my first time eating there, but it sure gives me a reason to come back! 
Other than that, portions are generous, the wait time isn't too long, and very nice service."}
{"text":"The word oink suggest bacon. When you receive it was a disappointment. I went twice to make sure it was not a fluke. 2 bacon with order maybe it reached 4 inches and barely was 3/4 wide. Thickness was a 1/16 wow. Waffle House is bigger. They should go to black bear dinner to understand bacon."}
{"text":"I've been to the other location in Paradise Valley, and this location feels a bit larger and easier for parking. I've come here maybe 3-4 times now in the past several months, and unfortunately things haven't been consistent. Expected time tends to be longer than stated, service IS SUPER SLOW, but food is good, which brings me back. If you love bacon, try this place out, and order the flight of bacon. On the upside, a Starbucks across the way will help your morning fix until you get seated."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal yet. Sometimes the wait on the weekends can be a bit long but that just goes to show how good the food is. If you love bacon (who doesn't love bacon...if you don't can you be trusted?) this is the place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! The bacon sampler is not something i'd do over and over, but it is a must try at least once. The Jalapeno and peppered were some of our favorites. Love that the space and that their tables aren't all crammed together. The menu has a wide variety of options for healthy and not so healthy. Great drink options (alcoholic and non). Ample portion sizes. We will return."}
{"text":"2/24/2017:
NOT diggin' the Biscuits & Gravy. The taste is NO BUENO. Owner, please change your recipe for both the biscuits and gravy. I didn't want to be \"that girl\" who sends her food back, so I reluctantly ate it.  If it was just me and my fam, I would've, but I was in a group.  Normally, that dish is a \"go- to/ no risk\" sort of dish, but here it's more of a \"stay away.\"

Earlier Feb 2017: 
I read reviews and wasn't keen on going when my hubby said he'd like to try it. However, I was glad I went after all.  

They had a call ahead list, which helped us with a baby in tow. 

Good experience, didn't see the dirty rag touch food, as other had said in their reviews. Maybe the owner made it a point to address it with his staff. 

It was a little hot sitting near the kitchen. Could use better ventilation, maybe a few fans or they could turn the AC on a bit more.  Also was a bit loud, as customers had said in their reviews. No music was playing, but for good reason, it would be much louder on a busy day. 

Great service from our waitress. She did a great job keeping my hubby's tea filled. 

Will be going back to try a couple other items on the breakfast menu. 

Oh, and about that crazy green... I know there are reasons they colored their restaurant that alarming color... everyone will talk about it, it will be different & bring in new business. Looks like I'm helping with that marketing, just by posting this."}
{"text":"Great place amazing staff and owners! Highly recommend the Benedict and flights of bacon and bloody mary's :)"}
{"text":"Visited The Oink Cafe on 12/27/16. I ordered the Turkado. It is eggs Benedict with turkey, avocado, and tomato. The hollandaise sauce was just \"ok\" for me, but overall the dish was delicious. I also had a side of hashbrowns and a mimosa. The ambiance is a little interesting, very bright colors on the walls and a little loud. Definitely a Cafe vibe. I will more than likely return as I would love to try their bacon flight sometime. :-)"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but was very disappointed.  The service was great, but the food was meh.  I've had better breakfast - and bacon at Village Inn.  I ordered the apple cider bacon with my breakfast, and I got two shriveled up pieces with a hint of apple cider.  My husband ordered the sugared bacon as a side, and for 2.99, he got two shriveled up pieces of plain bacon.  We expected brown sugared bacon, but it wasn't even sweet.  He ordered the Arizona omelette, which actually looked unappetizing with a mediocre sauce on top.  We decided that this was the first and last time we'll go here.  There are plenty of better breakfast places to go to in Tempe!"}
{"text":"We met with friends on a Sunday morning and the restaurant was too loud to even hear their voices at the same table.  I wouldn't recommend this location if you are hoping for nice conversation."}
{"text":"Basic breakfast place, too pricey for bacon & eggs. Not a bad experience, just Not worth the $$."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The breakfast chimi will change your life and the jalapeno bacon is to die for! The manager, Bob, was SO nice and the customer service alone was reason enough to go back. Very highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to the Bloody Mary flight but I was disappointed when it was served warm. The food is good, but my sliver of ham was so small the server even laughed. After dumping ice in my drinks and getting another sliver of ham and sending my eggs back twice, I had a pretty good breakfast."}
{"text":"I normally never write reviews but today warranted a review. The nice hostess took our name and quoted a 20 minute wait-- no big deal, we happily waited. We were sat and brought coffee in a quick manner. We placed our order shortly after and this is where things we wrong. We started to see plates come out of the kitchen for tables that had been sat after us-- again, no big issue, we had time and dismissed it. However, after waiting 30 minutes we were out of coffee and thirsty. My friend asked for waters and the waitress only brought 1. She then was not to be seen for another 15 minutes, which led us to share our small glass of water. Finally we were teased by food! The runners came and they had the order for another table. They apologized and proceeded. Finally, a manager happened to swing by- he wanted to offer more coffee. After 3 cups of coffee, a small water, and no sight of food for the last 50 minutes, the last thing we wanted was a coffee refill. We explained to him the situation and finally after over an hour, things were looking up for the food. Our original waitress had been waiting tables around the restaurant during this time and did not check in at all. It's almost as if she was avoiding our table! Right around the 1 hour 15 mark we finally got our food. It was okay. I had come in before and really enjoyed it. Anyways we scarfed it down due to the wait we had just endured. Near the end of the meal the waitress came by and admitted that she never put our original order in. What?!? She said it was too busy. We will give it another shot because we've both worked in food and know things happen but it's quite difficult to wanna come back if our whole day is put on hold because a waitress forgot to hang a ticket."}
{"text":"The thought of bacon directed our bicycles to the Oink Cafe for brunch, but a crowd surrounding the place almost drove us away. When we saw the bar serving bloody Mary's we were in. We were told the wait was about 30 minutes and enjoyed a yummy, rather spicy Bloody Mary.  The colors in place where odd, I thought neon green was back in the 80s?  After our half hour wait, we were seated and noticed several other empty tables which seemed strange.  It was also very hard to talk as it was loud!  We ordered the bacon flight which was very interesting; I loved sampling the 10 varieties and amazed at how different each was.  We shared the chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy were great."}
{"text":"Wow- the colors inside will wake you up.  Not a fan of the decor.  I personally felt it was too expensive for what you get.  Not memorable as I don't really remember what. I had, some omelet i would suppose.  With all of the other choices in town, I wont go back."}
{"text":"You can't help but be curious of what this place is when you drive by and see the name. Oink Cafe is a locally owned modern style cafe that serves both breakfast and lunch. The things that make this place stand out is their cocktail and espresso bar that includes a Bloody Mary flight, a 50-50 burger (half beef, half bacon) and of course everything bacon included with many of their entrées. They have eight flavored bacon choices (pepper, applewood, jalapeño, hickory, sugar-cured, apple cider, honey-cured, and chef's choice) that can be ordered as a flight or included with one of their meals. The cafe isn't incredible large, the walls are lime green and the decor includes paintings and mini statues of pigs. Also hanging on the walls are coloring sheets colored by kids (kids eat free M-F with an adult entrée and 2 beverage purchase if they color a sheet). Breakfast includes a variety of omelets and benedicts that are centered on bacon. Prices I would say are a tad bit higher than most breakfast places. The 8 bacon flight will run you about $11, which I think it pretty high for a side bacon (even flavored bacon). They offer 4 slices for $6. I got the jalapeño bacon per my server's recommendation with my breakfast. I enjoyed the spiciness of it but wasn't particular overwhelmed with the bacon itself. I guess if you are going to advertise yourself as a bacon joint I was hoping for some good-sized slices of bacon. My service was decent considering my server was covering quite a few tables. I didn't try one of their popular Bloody Marys so I didn't get the full treatment of this place. But overall I found Oink Cafe a fun concept with a possibility for a revisit in the future. Btw... they offer a free Best Maple Bacon Donut on your bday."}
{"text":"As Oink's namesake would suggest, the emphasis of this popular weekend brunch spot is (not surprisingly) pork.  That said, the menu at Oink is a fairly robust variety of traditional and non-traditional breakfast and brunch dishes.  Bacon flights, donut holes, and a number of so-called \"confit\" dishes round out some of the more unique offerings.  On a recommendation from a friend of ours, a large group of 10 of us rallied to come here around Noon time on Saturday with the promise of a good brunch.

I had anticipated a crowded wait upon arrival and at first it appeared we would have to wait upwards of an hour to get seated.  However, much to our delight the staff at Oink went to work immediately to carve out room for our large group towards the back of the restaurant.  Thanks to some yeoman's work by the staff, our wait was trimmed to just 10 minutes.  Upon seating I perused the lengthy breakfast menu looking for something that stood out.  Oink helpfully labels some of the standout pork items on their menu with the obligatory pig logo so I narrowed my focus there.

The menu item that won me over was the pork confit benedict.  This take on the classic eggs benedict includes the usual toasted english muffin, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce.  But unique to this iteration is the slow cooked pulled pork.  Also got a side of mixed fruit.  Total cost including tax and tip came to about $15.  First bite?  Yeah buddy.  The combo of the egg yolk, pork, muffin, and hollandaise was as hearty as it was heavenly.  Traditional eggs benedict itself probably wouldn't be enough to fill me up, but there was plenty of pork on both muffins to leave me full and happy.  Its probably a good thing I got fruit instead of hash browns as a side, otherwise I'm not sure I would've cleaned my plate.

Big thumbs up for Oink.  They went above and beyond the call of duty to get our group of ten seated quickly despite a long line of hungry customers waiting along side us.  The server was super helpful in steering some of our waffling group members towards dishes she knew they'd like.  And the prices for the portions of food that were served were quite reasonable.  It isn't easy to standout on the breakfast and brunch scene in the Phoenix metro, but Oink brings a good mix of traditional and in house creations to the table.  Yes there's some good vegetarian options here too, but with so many delicious and enticing pork offerings, resistance (at least for me) is completely futile."}
{"text":"After months of wanting to go to the oink cafe for breakfast we finally went, the pictures on yelp and Instagram looked so good, we expected a delicious breakfast. Let's just say the pictures were deceiving 
The waitress was horrible! And the food was not good I would of prefer to have mc Donald's for breakfast to be honest. The waitress kept forgetting our drinks, our food took forever to arrive and the place wasn't even that full, I asked for an iced coffee and I had to make it myself she only poured coffee and some ice cubes on my cup and told me to make it on my own."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Loved the bacon flight. Nice environment. Server was very friendly and quick to get our order."}
{"text":"Good food, a bit pricey.  6 of us bill came to about 80 plus tax.  Will come back again and try lunch."}
{"text":"Rachel our server was great! Very nice and polite. The food was fantastic love all the bacon choices. I ordered the biscuits and gravy I would definitely order them again. 

The manager even came to our table and asked how everything was. She was also very nice. 

This is a great place to enjoy breakfast with the fam!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place in town in my opinion. The bacon is to die for. The quality of service and the food is amazing. Today the dish wasn't so great  (poached eggs were cooked too long) and I didn't eat it. The owner came over and said it wasn't acceptable and took the dish off. We tipped off the original amount but the service was outstanding. Thank you. ! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Customer Service was Great!!! Thanks Desiree! Jalapeno bacon was the best ever!! Highly recommended for those Mid-Westerners who want a twist if Southwestern charm!"}
{"text":"Clean bright place with good energy. Good variety on menu. Our Server JASMINE. was Terrific. Be patient,  the kitchen is slow but worth the wait. Group of 4, everyone satisfied but for 1 side order of eggs cool. We will be back."}
{"text":"I stopped by with my buddy for breakfast after he hit the gym and we almost left because it was super packed on the weekend but thankfully we stuck it out. I got the pork confit benedict and every bite was so perfect I don't know how else to describe it. My buddy got the pork confit omelette and that wasn't as good but the pork confit saves it definitely. A weird annoyance was that the table we sat at was really wobbly so it was almost like eating on a moving train and we spilt a lot of coffee but our waitress was on top of the refills so just a minor grief. My only regret was that I really wanted to get the bacon flight but it couldn't justify it but maybe next time."}
{"text":"First time for breakfast/lunch.  Busy -had to wait for a table @ 15 minutes.  Not to bad of a wait.  I ordered the California  chicken omelet, hubby ordered the burger special -Hog Heaven burger.  He liked the burger but would be better with a heartier bun.  Burger big and juicy, bun small and soft. Omelet  was delicious and just enough heat with the pepper jack cheese and green chilies.  Ordered home fries great flavor with onion and bacon.  Service was great, staff very friendly.  Would definitely try again.  One down side- very noisy and hard to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"I took my family there in November and split a chorizo omelet with my daughter. I shared a bloody marry that had bacon in it. It was delicious. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing! I had the pleasure of meeting Bob and Desire this week while eating here with a friend for lunch and they were amazing!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for awhile. Not too impressed the place was very noisy , no one had a smile. The restaurant was very hot. No we were inside!!  When we try a new place we always have eggs Benedict, if the Benedict is good we will try something else the next time.. well not so great just ok.. don't think we will be coming back"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the bacon benedict while my girlfriend had the florentine benedict - both with home fries. I was very impressed and way more full than I expected. The bacon flight was pretty cool as well. 

Our server Cassie was awesome and my only regret is that we didn't try any of the mimosas. Overall a very great experience and we will definitely be back. 

Thanks to Donnie, Gladys, and the rest of the crew for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was not greeted by the 3 ladies at the station until after they finished their important non-work discussion, so it was off to a rough start. Food was ok but I really thought the flight of bacon would be impressive and not scrawny strips that appeared. You'd really want that to be the item that sets you apart from other places but not here. The strips were thin, small and not crisp plus presented on a large serving board that only added to their diminutive nature. Flavors were interesting but nothing I would go out of my way for again. Service was excellent. We were checked on often even though our food came out at different times. Kinda noisy."}
{"text":"After living in the Valley for close to 10 years, and never having found a breakfast spot to call my own, I can proudly report this.is. It.

 it was so good. Seriously, so.good. Everything tasted so fresh. The portions were huge[I had to take a box home], and they have Mimosa flights/ Bloody Mary flights[ yum!], and...bacon flights![ I know.I know, it boggles the mind]. O.M.G seriously you guys, so delicious.

i had the Arizona sunrise omelet, and my partner had the Oink breakfast Burger. both were huge, fresh, delicious.

I have no idea what makes some of the reviewers say it was frozen -fromthebaggie- food.I personally felt it was top notch, and while it took a bit to come out, I'm assuming it is because you know..it was BEING COOKED.[Americans are obsessed with no wait time, often nay, usually ,sacrificing quality for speed of delivery].

I found the decor to be country, cute and well-pig- themed, which is kinda what you would expect from a place called the Oink. people having issues with the -decor- actually made me laugh out loud- wow, SERIOUSLY?

We got here sometime after 9 am and there was no wait, however, a wait usually signifies the joint is popular and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! You can't go wrong with mimosa and bacon flights, the staff is always super friendly (Mo and Desiree helped us today and they were awesome!) and it's a fun atmosphere. Highly suggest!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! Always to order as I like crispy bacon and eggs over easy. The french toast is great! Only thing I did not like, had to flag down the very busy waitress for more coffee and water."}
{"text":"The food was great!  It was super busy but our server was very attentive.  We had to try the bacon flight, bloody mary flight and mimosa flight.  The verde bloody was my favorite - very refreshing.  The only negative for this place is no changing table in the restrooms.  They have highchairs... but nowhere to change a baby."}
{"text":"Went in for a late breakfast on Sunday. Nice atmosphere, great service, & excellent food. Loved the biscuits & gravy. My wife loved the Pork Benedict. Had three flights - Bacon, Bloody Mary, & Mimosa, loved them all. Can't wait Togo back with friends and family."}
{"text":"Yum! They have perfected bacon. The pecan is the best. Bit of a wait when we went on Sunday, but well worth it. Great service too. Generous portions. We will be back."}
{"text":"The front door staff is not very friendly but other than that the food was great, waitress was great. Ordered the pork confit Benedict, oink French toast, and a few of the different types of bacon, all amazing. Did the mimosa flight and Bloody Mary flight and all were delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place since it opened wanting to stop in and try it. 

Today I had the chance to stop in for breakfast. 
Service was great and the food was delicious. Portions were good sized for a big eater like me. 

I tried the Oink omelette which I would recommend if your hungry and need to fill up."}
{"text":"I had a couple of Facebook friends post pictures of their visit to this new breakfast place so I thought I would give it a try. 

I ordered the Eggs Benedict southwestern style (forget the exact name). For $11.50 you get 2 eggs, on top of a piece of chorizo sausage and a green chili slice and southwest style hollandaise sauce. That was pretty good. It came with a choice side so I got the hash browns. They were kind of dry and overcooked. Not the greatest. That's pretty much all you got for that price. No bacon, no toast etc. I don't think I will be back based on the pricing of what you get for your money and although the food was good, it wasn't the best breakfast place around and the best is way cheaper. 

There were 2 people in my party and our bill was $36 and one of us only had water to drink, the other had ice tea so figure about $12-15 per plate. They do nickel and dime you for every little thing you want extra of i.e.; small side of salsa for my dried out hash browns. 

Next.............."}
{"text":"It was my boyfriends birthday and we're both very passionate in our love for breakfast food  we decided to do brunch here as I had seen posts on social media about their bacon and mimosa flights and it seemed like a great way to start out a day of celebration. We got the mimosa flight (the seasonal apple pie and the strawberry banana were the stars of the show). Then we had the bacon flight (try the jalapeño and the apple cider!). I got the bacon Benedict with jalapeño bacon (and the great home fries!) and he got the breakfast chimi. The chimi was so big that my boyfriend (who's a big guy) barely made a dent. And the cheese chorizo sauce was both of our favorite part of the whole meal (I dipped my fries in it). All the food was amazing and so filling. We wound up actually taking the leftover chimi for us both to have breakfast tomorrow. We had Cassidy and her trainee as our servers. I can't remember the trainees name but they were both very friendly and prompt. One of the big things that kept us from giving five stars however was the hostess who was there while we were being served. She didn't greet us, took us to the table, tossed the menus down and said \"Cassidy will be with you.\" Which was obviously not a good start on our first visit. Later, the server trainee innocently asked what the season was for the mimosas and she answered him in a very short and snarky tone as well. :( 

Overall a great place, just don't let that very initial impression chase you off!"}
{"text":"Ate at the bar for Mother's Day and got in right away. The service was good for how busy they were. Ate a bacon flight and then had a Chorizo omelette. The bacon flight was fantastic. Eight different types of bacon, my favorite was the Jalapeño and Pepper infused. The Chorizo omelette was just OK, the Chorizo dominated the omelette and over powered everything else. The hash browns were very tasty and friend perfectly. 

I didn't try but would have liked to was the Bloody Mary board. Four different types of Bloody Mary's including an oink specialty Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Two words-frozen potatoes. A breakfast place that doesn't serve fresh cut and cooked, seasoned potatoes can never rate 5 stars in my humble opinion. The biscuits were large and flaky, the choices of bacon good and all tasty. Our server was efficient, friendly and offered us a bacon covered donut hole to sample. Every item needs to be well seasoned and fresh for me to be impressed however. I may return for another try but there are other places in this area offering very good breakfasts that I'm not sure this will be my first choice on a weekend."}
{"text":"What can I say about a horrible experience? Strawberry cheesecake pancakes were almost no cheesecake sauce and strawberry sauce...and that was a $3.00 up charge. They cover the fact up by lots of whipped cream.  My friend ordered the bacon flight and didnt get the correct bacon types she ordered.
The wait staff barely waited on our group.  Waitress pretty much ignoed me in my party of 8. She didnt bother to get me a menu, or when  I asked her for cream for my coffee she did not ever bring me any.  Her service?  It gets worse.  When she comes by to refill coffee, she fills up my friend's (she is sitting next to me) when we both put our coffee mugs next to one anothers simultaneously to make life easier for the waitress.  The waitress fills only one of the cups, ignoring me again, and I am at the end of the table. Perhaps she has vision problems along with her memory issues. Unbelievable, right??  To top things off, ( no pun intended) when she comes by the table later, I ask her for more coffee. Her response?  Wasn't just to me but directed to our entire table via her broadcast that I would need to wait awhile because she was busy. So very rude.  

Place is over rated  and who needs the abuse from some bratty waitress girl.  My advice to her is a hangover from Saturday night is no excuse for how you treat customers Sunday morning. Plenty of other choices such as BLD."}
{"text":"Finally went here, with a group of seven, so got to see several choices. Noise level is too high. Food is okay, but not great; I'd go to US Egg or First Watch instead, as far as other places I've been to. Maple bacon doughnut is a joke-doesn't look appetizing, very heavy texture. Eggs cooked perfectly, hash browns overdone, bacon was, well, BACON. Biscuit good. Coffee good. Everyone left full, but none of us in a hurry to go back. And two of us live really close."}
{"text":"The color scheme of bright green and yellow is really off-putting. Service was horrible despite the multiple servers running around or behind the bar. Took 20 minutes to get our food of 2 sandwiches and 1 salad. One sandwich was ordered without tomato and it of course had it and there was about 2 tablespoons of mayo on it. One water refill was offered and then we sat at the table with our dishes piled up waiting for a check while servers continued to walk past us. Would not return."}
{"text":"The Oink has become one of my favorite breakfast spot, which is shocking because I'm not a huge fan of pork or bacon! I know, I know, how can you not like bacon? Well, I guess I just needed a place to expand my bacon horizons! My fiancé and I got their bacon flight and I've never appreciated this breakfast staple as much as I did in that moment. Now, onto the meal. Ive only been here twice, so I've gotten the chorizo eggs Benedict and the pork confit breakfast chimi. Again, not a huge fan of pork, but my good lord was it delicious. It was smokey, had a little spice, and incredibly filling. I ate the whole chimi. The chorizo eggs Benedict were also fantastic. I've never enjoyed benedict so much before. I've also tried the French toast and waffles since my fiancé is more of a sweets for breakfast kinda guy, and those were wonderful too. He also got an omelette once and it was probably bigger than his head! Their portions are a very good size so you'll definitely be leaving full. 

So if you're looking for great breakfast, a beer or Bloody Mary, and a very full stomach then come to Oink cafe!"}
{"text":"Oh boy oh boy, numnumnumnum it's Bacon!!

We stopped by here on a whim. Glad we did! Friendly, fun service (thanks Jennifer!) and of course world class Ham n bacon, served up in many delectable varieties.  

While bacon's the star of the show, we were blown away by the home made salsa, as well as the chorizo cheese sauce slathering my breakfast chimichanga. 

We didn't drink this time around, but there's good beer on tap and a nice array of yummy-sounding Bloody Marys. I also loved the green tea. Don't worry, there's also other good stuff on the menu for vegetarians and non-bacon fans.

Great food & drink at a good price, served up with a smile!"}
{"text":"This was by far one of the best dining experience I have had in a very long time. Fabulous food! Excellent service! I will certainly return!"}
{"text":"I'm coming back for sure!!! Friendliest service!! Then the food came.. WOW!! SEARCH NO MORE!! 
I'm busy enjoying my meal here!!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday morning, as expected to place was very busy. Unfortunately there is not very much organization when it comes to the front hostesses area. There is little to no room to check in or wait the 40 minutes it takes to get a seat , which in fact she said it would only be 20 minutes. When finally taken back the hostess explains that they had multiple people call out. It's unfortunate because our food was great and the portions are huge, but the hectic feel made the restaurant really unenjoyable. Props to our server who was efficient at getting our orders in and to the cooks who made our food quickly. If it wasn't for them I would not recommend this place until they have a better system for getting customers through the door and seated."}
{"text":"I went here with my son for breakfast for the first time and was blown away by how great everything was. To start, the coffee was awesome! I love coffee and drink it black because I like the taste of good coffee. I don't drown out the flavor with cream and sugar. Anyway, the coffee was excellent. We both ordered the \"Flight of Bacon\" (bacon sampler) and we both had the \"Oink Omelette\" which was huge! It contains 5 eggs and is the largest omelette I've ever had in my life. It also has bacon, sausage, ham, and cheddar cheese in it which I could not finish it so I took the rest home. My son finished his eventually and we were both left quite full and very happy. We went to the location in Tempe and I really liked the layout because it's a nice open floor so you don't get the feeling like you're crowded or too close to other guests. I had a chance to see other orders being delivered to the table and everything else looked really good as well. I would definitely recommend to someone who wants excellent food and good portions and I would give them 6 stars if I could. This is now my favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Really noisy. Decor unappealing. Most items covered in sauce that tasted like it came from a can. Service was slow and not particularly friendly."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere great service good choices. Enjoyed breakfast with my wife on our last day in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Well this is my second visit in less then a week, if that tells you anything. Beyond fab for food and the service is great! We met the owner last visit as well as the manager and it's nice to see the manager here again, working. You lead by example and this guy is a leader. The inside is bright and fun. A nice large screen tv in the center of the dining room as well as 2 large tvs at the bar. Yes! I said BAR! Drinks are amazing, be sure to have the oink Bloody Mary, you won't be disappointed. They only do breakfast through lunch, although I would kill for bacon for dinner.. just sayin. Prices aren't bad for fresh food and to patronize a locally owned business. I'm excited to order the sunrise Benedict today. My husband had it last visit and man did I have ORDER ENVY! I'd like to see bacon flights paired with beer for another exciting explosion of taste. (Just my humble suggestion)  The menu is so exciting I will have to come back at the end of the week ! CANT GO WRONG HERE!"}
{"text":"Our first stop here in the Phoenix area. We chose to come here based on its closeness to our hotel and it ended up hitting the spot after a 5 hour drive. First off, they have a bloody mary flight?! You've got my full attention after that. I believe they have 6 options to choose from, we liked the 4 we chose, only get the siracha one if you really like siracha though. We tried the mimosa flight as well, I wouldn't really recommend this unless you like sweet drinks a lot. The classic and the cranberry were good but the peach mango and blueberry pomegranate tasted like really sugary juice. 

Now for the food! This was honestly one of the best eggs benedict I've ever had! My boyfriend had the spanish style with chorizo and enjoyed his too. We were surprised because this place seems to be known for their bacon dishes. 

The decor is super cute and bright and the bathroom was clean. The hostesses were welcoming and the service was good. I liked how they have a bar too even though they only serve breakfast and lunch, you don't usually see that. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great Place Off the Normal Grid Bright & Cheerful... Decor ... Friendly Staff This Place Rocks Breakfast. Delish Breakfast Bacon Potatoes & Pancakes. Should Have Shared Was Stuffed like A Piggy ! OINK! Staff Attentive Restaurant Clean Lunch Menu Looks Good Too But They Close at 2PM So Get there On Time. Corner of Warner & McClintock By The Phenix Suites."}
{"text":"Super good breakfast! Just what SouthTempe needs! The Bloody Mary flight had an awesome green, tomatillo version."}
{"text":"Came here today for breakfast before heading to the mall. I had the Bloody Mary flight and enjoyed 3 of the 4 drinks. I also ordered the biscuits and gravy-which were okay. My sister had the eggs and my niece had something else and they all seemed to enjoy their meals. The service started out really slow but once we were on their radar, our drinks and food came out quickly."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Omelette you all in on the best kept secret of Tempe - The Oink. My boyfriend and I drove past this place and looked it up on Yelp - we can't believe there are negative reviews. The bacon flight is awesome, the service is supreme - Shoutout to Cassidy and Bob the manager - and the food is the pig's tail - better than the cat's pajamas. A great place to go before going and Bacon in the hot AZ sun. Don't listen to the negative reviews - those people are oinkin crazy. So come on down, find you a convenient porking spot, and have the swine of your life."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!! Rachel was amazing server and very attentive and polite. The hostess Desiree approached us to make sure everything was good. Hickory bacon was the best, nice and crispy!!"}
{"text":"Oink for me was...Ouch !
Went to breakfast at The Oink Cafe with my wife. This cafe's claim to fame is bacon. I ordered a half flight of bacon,4 slices,of my choice. Also had the breakfast chimi with pork confit and scrambled egg covered in a chorizo & cheese sauce. Home fries on the side. 
Food arrived and I look down at my plate and notice green and red peppers along with onion mixed in my home fries. NOT as described on the menu. Ok. Eat around them. One strike. Chimi looks good. Cut into it and ... You guessed it,more green peppers and onions mixed in with the pork and eggs. NOT as on the menu. Tasted the Chimi and it was awful. Pork confit taste murdered by veggies. Strike two. Ate my bacon and it was fine. 
Here comes the manager/owner. He wants to now how things are?  He sees my half eaten plate and wonders. I explain the peppers & onions, not on the menu, have ruined my meal. He explains \"Yeah,that's how it comes. Next time you'll know to order it without.\"  Next time? He doesn't offer to make it right in any way,shape or form. Strike three. 
Waiting outside for my wife and the manager/owner comes up to me and says he looked at the menu, nowhere were peppers & onions listed on the menu in my items. He tells me they need to make it as the menu says or print new menus. Still no offer to make it right by me. So absorbed in the business that he forgot the customer. 
I will not go back to The Ouch Cafe."}
{"text":"So I don't write a bad review unless the situation absolutely demands such a resolution. Furthermore, although this bad review is mostly about the food, I've never written a bad review about someone's service, I figure that's generally the nature of the beast, until today...

Murphy's Law was swinging in full effect. Everything that could go wrong - did. First, the food. My mom and I both ordered a half Cobb salad for $8, the full was $10. But we didn't want a monster, just a good size salad to fill us up. What came out was what I can only compare to a side dinner salad - the tiny thing that restaurants serve to just tide you over until the actual meal comes. You've got to be kidding. 

I'm allergic to tomatoes and absolutely hate blue cheese, so I subbed the blue cheese for cheddar and ordered no tomatoes because I was allergic. Of course, got tomatoes, atop my teeny tiny little salad. I gave those to my mom. I went to pour a little ranch on my salad, and it had the same consistency of water, which rolled right off both of my pieces of lettuce. I felt I had to order another ranch and try this again, from maybe an engineering perspective to make this work, the waiter brought me blue cheese.  I poured it on, realized it was chunky, and ruined the small half of my salad that was remaining. 

It took 5 minutes to get my waiters attention so I could point out his mistake. I told him \"you brought me blue cheese\" as I suggested a gander down to the chunks on my lettuce. Awkward silence, he wasn't getting it. So I then said \"I asked for another ranch...,\" to which he shrugged and said \"Sooooo..... do you want another salad?\"  Well buddy, you just ruined mine sooooo..... yeah. 

Five minutes later, I get another salad, with tomatoes. He sets it down, walks away, and it was then I realized I had left my fork on my old plate. A few more minutes go buy as I attempt to get his attention to get another fork - this must be the most oblivious waiter I have ever seen. I just left it sitting there hoping someone would notice. It was then he brought our check, laid it on the table next to my new salad, with tomatoes, and no fork. I brought all this up again, now making my mom uncomfortable, and said just forget it, it's a perfect storm of events, let's cut this cord and I'll just go. He then proceeded to get another check with my salad off of it. 

The hostess came by to get our plates and starts drilling me on why i hadn't touched my salad (the few pieces of lettuce were fine, it was literally everything else that was wrong and not to mention, I still don't have a fork... I really don't like confrontation at a restaurant though, I just don't want to talk about it anymore,) but she kept drilling me! And then started drilling me on the service! I told her \"I don't want anymore confrontation, I'm just going to write a review on yelp.\" She rolled her eyes and kept drilling me, and I said it again, so she rolled her eyes and said \"yeah I get it, you're just going to write a review on yelp. Whatever.\"

And I'm only mentioning this because it's hilarious to think they could get a soda wrong, but they didn't have their syrup/CO2 ratios right, so this whole time, my Coke tasted like gross soda water. 

It took forever to get our salads, and I felt bad for the lady next to us at a table by herself in the middle of the restaurant who also sat and waited 20 minutes for service. You could obviously tell she was uncomfortable sitting there - in the middle of the floor, alone with everyone watching her. She looked miserable from this situation! They couldn't maybe seat her somewhere more comfortable or at least expedite her breakfast?!?! I couldn't be the only one who noticed, come on. Common sense isn't common.

 You'd get more food and better service at a truck stop. If you want  lunch with a heaping side of 'pissed off' because of bad service, expensive and minimal food, and bad attitudes, this is your place."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Oink Cafe in Tempe as we had already gone to the one in Scottsdale.  We got there about 11:00 am on Saturday morning and even without a reservation we were in and out within the hour.  Great food, excellent ambience.  I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"I came here today for the first time. I walked in the doors at about 9:00am, and was seated immediately. My server was a young, charismatic woman by the name of Jasmine.  After reading some of the reviews here on Yelp, I decided to order the Breakfast Chimi. I was not disappointed. It is huge, so I had it for breakfast (9am) and lunch (3pm), and skipped dinner. This is not a diet special. It sticks to your ribs. 
My next visit, I plan to try the full bacon flight."}
{"text":"OMG  I was visiting for business and before the fourth and final 10-hour day, I needed a real home cooked breakfast.  After reading yelp reviews, I chose The Oink cafe. 

And so glad I did!  Quick super friendly service. I'm very particular about my eggs so when the yolks were runny, rather than take my entire plate, my awesome waitress let me keep eating & brought me 3 more eggs, perfectly cooked. 

I left full, completely satisfied and on time. Delicious home cooked meal to start my day. Thanks oink cafe."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! This restaurant has true southern hospitality, and every employee is so delightful! Thank you Desiree for world class customer service, we will be returning!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch on a Saturday morning. I was seated right away and the service was great!!! The mimosa flights are a must!!!! I am not much of a Bloody Mary person, but my friend did also get the Bloody Mary flight. He loved it. I got the eggs Benedict with hash browns and all of it was delicious and well prepared. The ham had this wonderful smoky taste to it."}
{"text":"Food was ok. They are dry.... gravy and biscuits. And the burrito. Eggs and fries were great. Waiting for the meal was about 10 min too long. Some of the food carriers need to be aware of kids and babies. They were hovering hot plates over my 1 year old."}
{"text":"This is a great idea totally ruined by an overly noisy environment and poor execution. Eat before you go here.  It takes forever to get food."}
{"text":"Popular place to come to on a Sunday. 

We were told it would be about a 25 minute wait, but only waited about 10 minutes so it was a nice surprise. We were seated by a nice hostess then greeted by our very rushed waitress. She seemed very stressed, and it made me stress a bit as well. She asked for our drinks and we asked for waters, because we still needed to look at the menus. As we looked through the menu we also went ahead and decided to have our food order ready just because she looked very rushed. She came by and I decided to order for me and my friend (not something I ever do, but felt like I had to). As I was ordering and getting the the words out she would cut me off which was annoying, because there were substitutions and additions we wanted to do. Finally got my order in .... 

First we got our mimosa flight which was really good however when it got to us it was really messy because it was spilled all over. So every time I went to pick up the drink it was wet and it would drip all over so i had to basically clean the mimosa cups. I had already cleaned up around them before I even started drinking them. Then we got the flight of bacon, but the only one that had a distinct taste was the jalapeño bacon the others tasted the same and the presentation again was awful. They brought it out and it was very greasy and honestly did not look very appetizing. They were okay. Lastly they brought out our breakfast entrees and with my omelet I added mushrooms, but no mushrooms were found. My friend ordered a biscuit and got an English muffin with her omelet. There were a few mistakes and the food was decent, but it could have been a lot better and more presentable and less rushed which could have avoided some of these issues I think."}
{"text":"I ordered the flight of Bloody Mary's and really enjoyed them. With the exception of the verde one, i had high expectations, it wasn't bad just not the greatest. The Thai one I really enjoyed. Ordered the chicken fri d steak. It was really good! My husband had the French toast and he really enjoyed it. The crust they dipped it in was a little heavy for him. Definitely will come back again to try their flight of bacon"}
{"text":"Oink Cafe in Tempe gets a big \"NO\" from me. Thirty minutes after placing our order, still no food. But people around us who came later got their orders. Waitress never checked on us in those 30 minutes, but doted on tables around us. We walked out. If you choose to go there, I hope you have a better experience."}
{"text":"A breakfast restaurant dedicated to bacon is a rest idea. You can order a bacon sampler with 8 different types!! Given that it's a new restaurant, there was a 20 minute wait on Saturday morning. We were seated quickly. I had an omelette, which was great. The omelettes are huge as well as the sides (comes with potatoes and choice of bread). It was properly cooked and generous in terms of toppings! The bacon sampler was one of the most awesome ideas I've seen in a long time. Each piece was unique and crispy. So in terms of food, this place nails it. However, the service was quite slow when it came to taking orders, getting silverware, and at the end of the meal. As a result, I've lowered my rating. But, as the kinks are worked out, I imagine the service will improve."}
{"text":"Awesome Mother's Day here at Oink. Great food and the service was superb! Thanks Ryan and Desiree!!!"}
{"text":"I needed something new and flash for breakfast, but I didn't want to drive to North Scottsdale, so I checked my Yelp app, and found The Oink Café.

THE OINK CAFÉ

The Oink Café is on the southwest corner of Warner and McClintock, in Tempe, Arizona.

The Oink Café was first opened in Phoenix in 2012, by owners Donnie Baxla, and his sisters, Heather Clauser and Joan Roeber, of Peter Piper Pizza franchises fame.

The Oink Café is a scratch-made breakfast and lunch menu, including eggs, omelets, chorizo, biscuits and gravy, pancakes and waffles.


THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE

I have to be honest - as soon as I saw the name, I wanted the place to be adorable, and it was.

Even though The Oink Café is in a strip mall situation, the particular corner it's on is quite established, and the foliage is mature, which makes it look less strip mall-y and nice.

The interior is bright, cute, and super clean. I totally love the pig vibe mixed with the edgy raw architecture.

The hostess sat me right away, and my server, Mo, was right over. She took my order very quickly, and brought out everything just as fast.

I tried the 8-piece bacon flight. OH. MY. GOD. SUPERB.

The bacon flight came with applewood, honey, jalapeño, pepper, sugar, hickory, apple cider, and pecanwood flavors. My favorites were the sugar and jalapeño flavors, but all were SUPERB.

I also tried the strawberry cheesecake pancakes. Yes. Yes. All the YES! They were utterly fantastic!

The Oink Café also has a full bar, so I sampled their peach mimosa AND their famous Tito's Bloody Mary.

CONCLUSION 

Everything was outstanding. I have zero complaints.

I highly recommend The Oink Café, and I will definitely be coming back.

5/5 RECOMMEND 

OF NOTE

*Plenty of parking out front.

*There are 3 locations: Paradise Valley, Tempe, and Tucson.

{"text":"After passing Oink Café many times on my way to work I knew I had to try them, so I grabbed my son and his friend and off we went. It was Saturday around 12ish so the wait wasn't that bad.

After we were seated I checked out the drink menu, and I was pretty excited to see they had a Verde Mary and knew I had to order one! 
Then I checked out the food menu and went with the Bacon Benedict which was a base of an English muffin then jalapeno bacon covered by poached eggs and topped with hollandaise sauce and came with a side of hash browns.

About 10 minutes went by and I asked our server how were the drinks going, and she said oh they are doneI've seen them over there at the bar waiting for me and then she left again, no explanation on if she  she was busy covering someone else table or not, the place wasn't that packed.  A few more minutes went by and the drinks were brought to us.

The Verde Mary  was a house Verde bloody Mary mix and vodka pour into a glass with a salted rim and garnished with tomatillo, jalapeno and cucumber.  This was a good Verde Mary, I just expected more of a tomatillo/jalapeno flavor.

Our order came out, and well I wasn't that impressed, the hollandaise sauce was on point and tasty, the eggs were poached perfectly, but the bacon was burnt as well as the hash browns. Breakfast over all was kind of disappointing. My son & his friend's meal were good though. Maybe it was a busy day before we got there and we just got the tail end of it, I don't know and I am sure I will be back to try them again, I just hope next time would be better."}
{"text":"Do not order the turkey club! Hardly enough turkey for a regular sandwich let alone a club priced at $10.49. Most likely will not be back. Loud when not very full. Can't imagine the noise when busy!  Also paint color is way too bright!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the third time. Funny we always get the same great waitress and table. Never have had a bad meal yet.  Portions are large and love the Togo cup of coffee. Kaitlyn will take care of you."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location. The interior is as colorful as the menu! They aim to please and you are guaranteed to be satisfied. Family friendly is an important aspect here. We will continue to return to The Oink Cafe!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for breakfast. Family loved it and I can grab food to go too! Highly recommended for everyone."}
{"text":"Loved the whole experience!  There was a wait so we sat at the bar and enjoyed our eggs Benedict, Belgium waffles, and egg sandwich.  Also had the bacon flight... I really loved it all.  They have awesome Bloody Mary flights, mimosa flights, and great grey hounds!  Perfect breakfast with perfect service!"}
{"text":"This new cafe opened down the street from my office, and immediately I was excited!  How can anything centered around bacon NOT be amazing?  We had lunch there today and it did not disappoint!  We started with the donut holes.  Delicious balls of dough, maple glazed and rolled in bacon.  They were heaven.  We brought a dozen back to the office to share!

I had an omelet with the chefs special bacon - of course!  My bestie had a BLT on sourdough, triple decker with your choice of bacon! Both dishes were amazing and prepared very quickly!

The service was superb!  The hostess and waitstaff very attentive.  And we had the chance to meet the manager, who stopped by to thank us and see if we needed anything!

This will definitely be on our list for a regular lunch spot!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was in search of a new breakfast spot and this is one of my new favorites. The staff was great and the food was amazing. We got the bacon flight, mimosa flight, strawberry cheesecake pancakes (which were like heaven ) and omelette with hash browns. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you have never tried this place, you are missing out!! I used to eat at the one in Paradise Valley. If you LOVE breakfast food and you LOVE BACON, then park your rear here at Oink Cafe!!!"}
{"text":"First I have to say the service was awesome. We had no trouble being seated quickly on a Sunday at 1pm. Our waiter was very sweet and cheerful, she was very busy but took good care of us. I had the BLT which was good but not great...three layers of bread on bland sourdough. Too much Bread, and needs more flavor. My partner had the Cuban which was delicious, he said it was 5 stars. We shared the Mimosa flight of four...great concept and a fun addition to our experience. Highly recommended and would've given 5 stars if not for the noise...Super loud. Please fix so we don't have to shout next time."}
{"text":"The strawberry cheesecake pancakes were excellent. However the 5 egg bacon omellet was a little on the dry side. Service was decent, not the best.

If I return if probably stuck with the pancakes and french toast, and avoid the egg dishes. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have tons of different flavored bacons that you can try. They have mimosa and Bloody Mary flights also. We have tried a few things off of the menu and haven't been disappointed yet! I highly recommend trying this restaurant if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The best breakfast ever!  I love the French toast with berries and you can't go wrong with the bacon plank!  Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Big enough place that the wait wasn't long but...I understand the low stars this place has received.  First they are stingy with coffee refills. It took a really long time for the food to come out. The pancakes were over cooked and when I asked for crispy bacon and it came out normal, they were happy to fix it for me but then I got back the two pieces they were obviously microwaved!!!!. :-( I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 because the hash browns and biscuits were excellent and although I asked for over easy and got over medium eggs they were delicious. Despite it being close to home I don't know if I'll be back. The prices are competitive with other breakfast spots and since that is equal and price isn't a motivator, I'll pick a spot with better overall food quality next time."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is terrible. The restaurant wasn't even busy and it took ages for anyone to even come to the table to take our drink order. When we did finally order it took another eternity to get our food. Ehh....."}
{"text":"First time here .... higher price but better quality food and big servings. Will be returning soon  Good selection on breakfast and mimosas and bloodymarys"}
{"text":"We decided to try out a new brunch spot, and what a good call picking The Oink. We did have to wait for a table, being Sunday, but we were greeted immediately after being sat. Our server Mo got us started a bacon AND bloody Mary flights. Which were awesome while we decided what to eat. Food was great, service was better. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Took my Grand daughter here for our weekly Date Day. Food and service were great. I forgot my debit card and had to run home to get it. Manager was great with this. Only thing I didn't care for was the Biscuits and Gravy. Seem to be overpowered with sour cream. Love Biscuits and Gravy but not here. Grand daughter like it though. All in all, a pretty good place."}
{"text":"First time in. We all had breakfast and it's really good. Went there for the Bloody Mary flight and the mimosa flight. Well worth it. Service was on point too."}
{"text":"Went there this morning (Sunday) at 9am expecting to wait for at least 15 minutes to be seated. We didn't wait at all! I ordered the two egg breakfast with potatoes, biscuit, and a cinnamon roll. Everything was incredible. I forgot about ordering bacon and later ordered a side of the jalepeno bacon, because you can't go here and NOT get bacon, and it didn't disappoint. After finishing it I was sad that I didn't order the flight of bacon.

 Service was excellent and food was amazing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was really hoping that this restaurant was going to be the best new thing in the neighborhood. Going in with my family, we waited about 15 minutes for a table, normal for a Saturday morning. When we sit down our waitress takes our drink orders, and asks us if we would like a flight of bacon. We get our bacon, and order our food. In the time that we ordered our food, 4 other tables had been seated and received their food. Time goes on, and we have been waiting for an hour, the manager is walking around on his phone, not checking on tables. After about 40 minutes of us sitting there the waitress finally stops and says that they are having issues with the POS printer system. So we wait a little while longer and then we stop the manager at that point and tell him that they can just cancel our order we are ready to leave. As soon as we stop him our food finally comes out. One order was burnt, the eggs were sour. In the end the manager took care of our bill. I am almost positive that the waitress forgot to put in our order. I was really excited to come in here with my family, this morning, and now i am sooo disappointed."}
{"text":"The Oink employees are awesome--friendly and accommodating.  But....the food was a huge disappointment and the decor was garish and unappealing.

Took a friend for lunch this week.  My BLT was on stale bread, the bacon tasted like it had been sitting since the breakfast shift and the sweet potato fries were totally devoid of flavor.  Everything was cold.

My friend's hamburger was so-so and she felt the same about the sweet potato fries.  Neither of us finished our meal.

Sadly, won't be going back."}
{"text":"AMAZING food!! I would highly recommend this place! Always delicious when I go!  Restaurant is also super adorable!"}
{"text":"Our group opted to try this place after our Pat Tillman Race.  The place was very busy by the time we arrived @ 11 AM.  There was about a 30 minute wait, which wasn't too bad, since it gave us the opportunity to sit at the bar to indulge in their specialty bloody marys.  They have a great selection.  While we all tried several different ones, I personally can say the ones that I tried were very good.  I selected the regular Oink and Spicy Thai and tried their flight sampler.  I can easily say this will be my place of choice for bloody Mary's...too bad they aren't open at night.  Once we were seated, the place is brightly decorated and we were greeted by our server.  He was friendly and attentive considering how busy they were.  I ordered the BLT w/jalepeno bacon and it was really good.  The bacon was perfectly season and full of flavor.  I can't think of any other way to enjoy a BLT, it had such a great kick.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would do 5 stars but for two things- it is very loud and my table top was so loose the coffee spilled when they delivered breakfast.

Ok enough of that and  onto something that really matters. I really like Hoosiers and I go to Biscuits because it is close and it is not noisy. Oinks goes in the \"I choose to go there\"  category. 

Food- you really can screw up eggs and bacon but every item was perfect. Eggs over medium, crisp bacon, sourdough toast, sliced tomatoes. It arrived quickly, hot, and with a big smile. The coffee is very good and they unobtrusively keep it filled. 

Service- from the reception (she asked if I wanted the newspaper) to the manager, Bob, it was on point. Caitlyn was attentive but not annoying by asking how it was all the time. If I looked at her she was right there as it should be. Bob introduced himself and we discussed that bilious green the place is painted and the sound level. Nice guy on top of his restaurant. 

Music- I am particularly annoyed by the music in most restaurants. I like music but it is always too loud and not what I like. Oinks has no music and I really like that. Actually it might just be too loud to hear the music. 

So good food, good service, welcoming, screaming lime green and loud. I will be adding them to my weekend breakfast routine. You know - breakfast then Home Depot. NOTE I noticed just before I posted this that as people started leaving it got much better in the noise."}
{"text":"Ate here at lunch time on a Thursday. Walked in and was seated promptly. I ordered a Bloody Mary, the full flight of bacon, and a BLT with jalapeño bacon. All was delicious. The Bloody Mary had an excellent spice mixture around the rim of the glass. The flight of bacon was cooked to perfection. It wasn't soggy or burnt. Just perfectly crisp. Jalapeño bacon BLT was also great. Bread nicely toasted. Lots of bacon in relation to veggies. All around a good meal. The hostess Desiree and the server Mo were both very attentive. Both came by multiple times to make sure everything was good. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I said just this morning that i really really wanted bacon for breakfast!! We went over to another retail establishment and saw this place on the way! How fortuitous! So after finishing with my transaction we headed over. They had a 45 minute wait for 2 people at 1130 on a Sunday. Wow! So we had a third errand to run. We put our name down and hoped for the best! We got back and although they called our name they put us up next. They have an outdoor patio/waiting area. Not sure if they have table service out there or not. The hostess was decidedly quiet/unfriendly. We got no \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day\" when we left. The green-shirted manager was walking around making sure tables were being turned over. I completely agree with both the loud noise issue and the lousy decor. The hubs & i were sitting next to each other and we could barely hear each other. The schizophrenic color scheme is troublesome.  The waitress was nice but the service was slow. We had to wait after we got seated and then waited to have our order taken and then waited for our lunch and then waited for our check...you get the idea. I read another review that mentioned about the kitchen staff bringing out someone's meal using a dirty rag touching their food. I saw that. Ew. Anyway, we ordered mimosas which were good, but small for $6.99. Then we order the bacon flight. Very tasty but again, paper thin like what everyone else has mentioned. I ordered the oink benedict and hubs ordered the pork confrit omelet. Both tasted decent but not *omg* amazing. We got water refilled twice and asked for a box for my leftover sweet potato fries. Lunch was $50 which was a bit hefty. Oh, the bathrooms were clean with 2 stalls and parking was a challenge. All in all, great concept but still have a few kinks to iron out yet."}
{"text":"Ryan and I came on a Sunday at about 1:40pm. There were quite a few parties still waiting outside. Luckily, we were offered two seats at the bar which we immediately took in order to skip the estimated 25 minute wait.

Looking at other reviews, many people mention service as being one of their complaints. I think sitting at the bar is the way to go then! With the two ladies at the bar, we were always quickly attended to and checked in on. We will definitely be sitting at the bar next time we come in.

There is a check-in offer for 50% off the second entree, but it is only valid Mon-Thur so boo on me for not reading the fine print! 

Ryan ordered the bloody mary flight for $11 -- you could choose 4 out of the 6 options on their bloody mary menu! I wasn't feeling a savory drink so I ordered a hazelnut iced latte which was quite delicious. 

SUNRISE BENEDICT
Chorizo patty and peppers on english muffin with a ranchero hollandaise sauce--this was quite tasty! My eggs on top were perfectly poached. The hash browns I ordered as my side were delicious and on the extra-crispy side, just like I like it.

THE OINK CHIMI
I was wavering between this and a few other options so I'm glad Ryan ended up ordering this but I was much happier with my benedict. The chimi was good, don't get me wrong, but it was just too much. The pork confit inside was a little bland -- not as flavorful as I expected it to be. But it is stuffed with potatoes, cheese and eggs so there was a lot to navigate through. 

SIDE OF BACON - $2.99
It looked kinda comical to see two limp little slices on a plate lol. Bacon was good though. Probably will opt for a flight next time.

My best advice for anyone would be to sit at the bar! All your needs will be taken care of quickly!"}
{"text":"The two stars are for my mimosa flight, it made my experience bearable. I was in Saturday for the first time. Basically your hostess with the \"at home ombré\" hair color and raspy voice. She was the worst. Rude, condescending and made blatant snarky faces. Host and hostess set the tone for the establishment you are visiting,  they are usually the first people you come in contact with. To be talked back to and a big cheesy smile right in my face after being rude is completely uncalled for. If your employees can't leave their attitudes at home then they shouldn't be in the service industry. I will never be back because of her."}
{"text":"A little wait but worth it....yummy food, great portions, good service but mabye a few more servers would help....will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I'm racking my mind trying to get to 2-stars...I just can't.  

I was very much looking forward to trying this place out and, alas, it let me down.  We'll get to the food in a moment but let's first start with the non-edible issues.

DECOR:

The decor here is striking and not in a good way.  Lime green and yellow with grey wood floors, pink granite tables...it like they designed the place strictly with Home Depot clearance items.  The menu, including the chalk wall, is very well done.  That looks nice.

SERVICE:

The coffee arrived after the food.  The table had dried up jelly on it.  The food runner was holding our dishes with a ratty dishtowel which was touching the food side of the plate.  Gross.

PRICES:

Entrees are in the $11-$15 range for the most part.    You're looking at about $30 for two people.  That's not bad if the serving size is good.

SERVING SIZE: 

Very underwhelming for the price.  The bacon, the star of the show here, was paper thin.  But quality matters over quantity...so the ingredients must be top-notch, right?

FOOD QUALITY:

Starting with the coffee, even though we didn't, the cappuccino foam looked like soap bubbles and was poorly prepared in an almost comical way.  The home fries were clearly frozen, bagged potatoes.  The hash-browns came from the same freezer section.  If the hollandaise sauce on the benedict didn't come from a can, they should switch to a canned variety because it was terrible.  The English muffins were thin, store brand quality (and barely toasted).  The eggs were good.  The \"pork confit\" is just pulled pork which was fine.  Both teaspoons of it.     

Maybe we ordered poorly?  Maybe we were unlucky?  Maybe the food just isn't good?  Whatever the case, I'd recommend you take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The service here was awesome. Staff was so friendly. I ordered the chicken and Chile omelet. Green chili's, bacon, avocado. I omitted the cheese and added jalapeños I absolutely recommend. I got it with a side of hash browns and an English muffing oh can't forget the Bloody Mary. The mix was perfect not a bottled mix."}
{"text":"Awesome. The acoustics within the restaurant weren't that great so it was hard to have a conversation with those i was breaking bread with, but the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place when the restaurant we normally go to was closed. The hostess and staff were very friendly and nice   M wife got the sunrise bennies and I got the pulled pork omelet. Hers was very good mine however was sitting in a puddle of grease. It tasted good at least the little I ate but I just couldn't get passed the grease. It actually gave me an upset stomach. I hate to give bad reviews and my wife said hers was very good but mine was not."}
{"text":"Had brunch today with a friend visiting from out of town. Cute decor, great Bacon benedict! My friend got the traditional and loved hers as well. I'll definitely be back to try a Mimosa flight and have more applewood and jalapeno bacon. Food came out quickly and was perfect. Ther server was friendly and attentive and even offered us ice water to go."}
{"text":"When we got there, they were pretty busy. Place smelled amazing and was pretty clean as well. We were seated right away, which was awesome...but it was down hill from there. 10-15 later we had yet to see our waitress. When we finally saw her she took our drink and food order and disappeared. 5 more minutes pass and we get our drinks. 20 min later we get our food, by this time my husband is ready for a refill, which he gets. 

My husband gets a heaping, massive portion of biscuits and gravy, with a side of eggs (HIS were real eggs), which he said was really good. I ordered a breakfast sandwich (offered on a biscuit but I asked for mine on toast) and home fries...I expected too much. What I got was half a sandwich made with liquid eggs (rather than scrambled like I asked for) and ONE piece of bacon broken in half. ONE PIECE. The home fries were way over cooked and had maybe 3 pieces of onion, 4 red pepper and 2 green pepper in them. Midway threw the meal we are both ready for refills and our waitress is no where to be found. After watching all the other waitresses handle their table it is clear we didn't have a great one, because she came out long enough to do what she needed and then disappear. 

I really wanted to like this place. They serve 8 kinds of bacon...but instead I left hungry and angry."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a while. Ended up going on a Sunday afternoon, which I don't recommend because it was pretty busy. 

The waiting area is tiny and there are only 2 benches to sit on and with people coming in and out it was pretty cramped.

We got seated in about 15 minutes and got a booth. The booth felt small, no give on the cushions at all and barely any leg room. I would not sit in a booth again. 

The waitress was nice, brought us waters right away and took our beverage and food orders. The water glasses are small so I ended up refilling another 2 times. I also got the coffee and it was kind of bitter. IHOP has way better coffee, honestly. I will credit them for having flavored coffee creamers so that was nice and countered the bitterness of the coffee.

I ordered the California chicken omelette wth a side of fruit. My partner opted for the Pork Confit omelette and we also were excited to try the flight of bacon because that is what they advertise for.

The food came out really quick, my omelette was okay, not overwhelming but good. The Pork confit omelette was drenched in this dark red sauce that overpowered the dish. Most of it was scraped off. It tasted like a ketchup/tang sauce with some spice. They call it the ranchero sauce and they should put it on the side. 
The pork confit omelette didn't have a lot of pork in it so again, underwhelming and overpowered by the sauce.

The flight of bacon was a total disappointment. 5 of the 8 pieces all tasted the same. I could taste some flavor differences in the jalapeño, pepper, and apple cider ones but all of the others, no. The bacon was also average size and thickness. For the price of bacon I would expect thick cut with bold flavor and didn't get any of that.

Overall, this rating is more like 2.5 stars and as excited as I was to try this place, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Definitely over rated and over priced. It was super crowded and we had to wait for an hour for the table. After we got our table we had to wait for an another 40 mins for food. I would have not been complaining if the food was worth it. But unfortunately that food was alright and definitely over priced."}
{"text":"We got in right away on a Sunday, and the server came by quickly. Our food came out fast. The food was good, large portions. Everything came out correct. There was confusion on one of the coffee drinks, but was quickly resolved. Only complaint was we had to track down our server to pay our bill."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant because of their 8 types of bacon they have. I love to come here because the food is so fresh and delicious! Love the Maple Bacon Doughnuts! Service is the best and everyone is very friendly. I definitely recommend this place!! O and Desiree is a lovely person to talk too"}
{"text":"Oink! Oink! nuff said!!!

Why stick a fork in it when you should just put your whole face into it...

*Snnnnnnnnnooooooorrrrrttttttttttt"}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the food quality 
I ordered the breakfast sandwich with ham - $4.99
A side of lettuce and tomato- $2.99 
The sandwich was 1/2 a sandwich ~ who does that???  The ham was a few deli slices - deli slices seriously 

My bf ordered the 2 egg breakfast. Like he says eggs are eggs but the ham was far from a decent size and the home potatoes looked like they had been under a heat lamp for a bit

Not impressed"}
{"text":"Sooo lets just start out with the fact that I really really REALLY wanted to love this place, I mean who could not love a place that served bacon in diff flavors on a platter. 

So lets start with the 30-45min waut just to get a table, which was fine, because like I said who couldn't want to love a place with BACON!!! Moving right alongggg we finall get a table and our waitress comes over ( I forget her name) and introduces herself and tajes our drink orders. We were starvinggg!! Along with our drink orders, we went ahead and ordered our omelets with hash browns ( I ordered the omelet with bacon/ham/cheese and my friend ordered this omelet with spinach,bacon??, and cheese) 
The food finally arrives and it looks ahmahhze balls as the runner sets our plates dwn in front of us and what do I see as my plate gets closer to me but this beautiful long hair sitting right on top of my omelet ( cue horror music).

Now my friends tears into his omelet and I feel like I'm forced w/ a decision as to not make a scene ( mind you I have a bad case of laryngitis or I've lost my voice) . I politely flag dwn someone and ask if I could get a new omelet, the waitress asks me what's wrong and I proceed to point out the hair on my omelet. She gasps and apologizes andvquickly takes my plate to the back. I don't know about you,  but hair kind of ruins my whole appetite, so to be honest I wasn't even hungry anymore. 

So as I patiently wait for my new food I'm left with twiddling my fingers and watching EVERYONE around me enjoy their food, including my friend .

The manager is walking through asking what seems to be every table, but ours how the food is. My good promptly arrives about 10-15 min later as my friend is finishing up his plate and I'm faced w/ an omelet I don't want anymore and no more cranberry juice to get me through. I take a bite of my omelet and I'm ready to bag up my food and go...

I just want this brunch to over already and to get some water or something to hold me over until I get home. The bill arrives and I peak a glimpse of it and see the price, and shake my head in dissatisfaction. I at least thought for the mistake we would be comped the drinks or something. 
The waitress takes the check and when she returns she brings over this little box and come to find out it was there signiture maple bacon donut. I was appreciative of her effort and bagged the dinut w/ my meal. 

I guess my experience was ruined at one hair, but for his food coming out correct and cooked well I'll give them 3 stars. I'm thinking I may avoid this place for awhile and maybe one day I can try breakfast/brunch again."}
{"text":"SECOND REVIEW. For being a morning breakfast and coffee place, the staff wasn't very warm and welcoming. Most of the staff was very \"blah\" and unwelcoming, the hostess didn't crack a smile or polite \"Welcome\" when we walked in. 

Our waitress was one of the few who made us feel welcome, although it was busy and she didn't check on us as often as you might want to be checked on. We didn't mind though. She made us laugh and invited us back. 

Food was as delicious as last time - turkey avocado Benedict, and bacon Benedict - didn't disappoint. Rating went from 5 to 3 due to the unwelcome vibe I got from the staff. Hope this changes, we love the food."}
{"text":"Food was OK.. Service was slow and no real information when we asked about items on the menu but the worse part is the acoustics.  It was so noisy in there you could barely have a conversation. Probably wont go back. To many choices"}
{"text":"We went here after seeing the \"Bacon Flight\" and other unique combinations on the menu. The bacon flight came out almost instantly (before our food and drinks) so you could tell they just had lots of bacon ready to go and who knows how long ago it was cooked. We really would have preferred to eat it with our meal. The bacon was not piping hot, the flavors didn't match the flight menu, and the bacon was absolutely lackluster. So disappointing. 

The bloody mary flight was absolutely delicious, but it took forever to come out, I had to ask and check in on it. This should have come out shortly after we ordered, because it's not something you can get through quickly so it would have been nice to be able to drink them while we were waiting for our food. 

When you order blueberry pancakes, you expect to have blueberries mixed into the batter. Not here. The put about 10 blueberries on top of the stack of pancakes. Again, disappointing with the presentation, but the pancakes and ham did taste good. 

The pork patty breakfast burger was also lackluster. Huge patty, but a small amount of hash browns and a tiny egg on top. With such a huge patty, you need equally good portions of other toppings, and this was very disproportionate. 

Over a $50 breakfast and extremely disappointed. Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"This little piggie went to market,
This little piggie stayed home,
This little piggie went to Oink Cafe,
And got turned into a bacon flight!

We got here at 9 AM on a Sunday and there was a 30 minute wait to be seated. Well.... \"Better be worth it\" I thought! It did allow me ample time to browse through the menu. They currently serve breakfast and lunch, with breakfast favorites such as omelets, Benedicts, and more Southwestern offerings such as the mighty breakfast chimi. Breakfast chimi or omelet? Hmm... Well I didn't feel like eating my weight in breakfast today so I went with the pork confit omelet! We also split the bacon flight.

The bacon flight came with a slice each of applewood smoked, honey cured, jalapeno, peppered, sugar cured, apple cider, hickory smoked and pecanwood smoked. Some of the pieces tasted very similar to each other. Out of all the slices my favorite was probably the apple cider due to the blend of light sweetness with the saltiness of the pork. The jalapeno was also notable for its spicy kick and I also enjoyed the applewood smoked bacon due to its light, almost fruity, smoky flavor.

I haven't ordered many items at a restaurant listed as confit so I was excited to try the cafe's version of it. The omelet was a sizable meal, coming with your choice of vegetable and starch. I chose the home fries and biscuit. The omelet itself was decent. The eggs weren't super fluffy and were just slightly too overcooked for my tastes. There was plentiful filling of pork, cheese and onion though. The menu listed it as having jalapeno in it too but I couldn't taste any of it in mine. The confit itself unfortunately was a little disappointing to me. For a meat that's been slow cooked for a long time at a low temperature I was hoping it would be amazingly, meltingly tender. The meat wasn't super tender, but it wasn't tough either. It also tasted bland compared to the powerfully rich red chile ranchero sauce on top. I did enjoy the sauce but felt it overpowered the whole dish because all I could taste was sauce with each bite.

The biscuit was decent and the potatoes with bell pepper and onion were a bit oily but plentiful. We also had coffee which was also decent and was refilled as needed.

Service was average. There were so many people here to serve that I didn't really expect a lot of personal attention here anyways.

Since there were so many people here it was pretty loud in the restaurant. If you're looking for a relaxing place to enjoy and unwind this isn't going to be your spot, at least when it's super busy on Sunday morning.

The restaurant takes up residence where Marcello's Pasta Grill used to be. They changed the decor considerably, to a lime green and bright yellow interior.  The bar is still here though so they do serve beer, mimosas and bloody Marys if you feel like having an alcoholic beverage. They also kept the nicely shaded patio which I'm sure will be a great spot to dine at once the weather gets warmer.

Overall, about an average experience food wise and service wise."}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing. We had the Turkey Avocado Eggs Benedict and the Chorizo and eggs. Literally everything was perfect. Our waitress, Mo, was a perfect sweetheart and very attentive. Desiree the assistant manager stopped by our table and was so full of energy it made our visit that much more amazing. One thing I HAVE to insist is that you try the Flight mimosas. It's a quad of different flavored mimosas. Trust me. They're amazing. Also try the Flight bacon. Again the half is a quad of different flavored bacons. You can get the full with 8 but we were trying to watch our girlish figure. :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous place to satisfy a craving for bacon! Staff was cheerful and courteous from the moment we entered.  Our meal arrived with minutes after ordering. This has become our new breakfast spot. Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"The mini Mimosas and Bloody Marys are pretty cool and the food was decent.  The bartender was a little sharp though."}
{"text":"The restaurant was cute and had a short wait. Our server Kitty was excellent! Couldn't have gotten better service. The food however, for me, wasn't so great. I ordered the Sunrise Benedict. The ranchero hollandaise tasted off from the start. I managed to eat half but felt nauseous afterwards. As soon as I got home I vomited until everything was out. The food made me feel miserable. The other guests were satisfied and didn't get sick. I think something was up with that hollandaise sauce. I'm never eating an eggs Benedict again."}
{"text":"Great concept but poorly executed, the bacon flight is amazing as is the Snapchat filter and the name. However the oink really disappoints. I wish the colors inside were more reflective of the name/logo, for example, brown, pink, tan, off white would be much more easier on the eyes vs the bright neon green and yellow on the walls which I simply don't understand unless I was at a laser tag place. 

I wish they had fresh coffee creamers, fresh butter, I wish my bacon flight was a little warmer, I wish the breakfast burger was more gourmet/quirky/unique.... a chefs creation rather than a fat pork patty slapped on some buns with a sloppy egg and mediocre hash browns. I ordered the wrong thing but apart from the burger I just wish the place was more cool lol, it seems poorly executed to me and far from its actual potential.. more chic more attention to detail and better vision on the little things would make a big difference. 

Oh it probably didn't help that when we sat down at our booth the table was very wet from a server wiping it down and consequently the menus were stuck like tape to the table... not a good start mr oink oink u fortunately I won't be back oh yea and don't serve a barrio blonde beer in an IPA San tan glass.. it's just not right, service was on point tho good job there :-)"}
{"text":"I felt the need to give this place some love after seeing its reviews. This is an awesome local spot in Chandler! I play Saturday morning soccer down the street and me and the mates come in after games for some bloody Mary's/breakfast and it never disappoints. I've ordered breakfast and lunch and really enjoyed everything I ordered. For lunch, they have this vinaigrette dressing that comes with their salads and it's amazing. I think they put bacon in it or something so it's probably not healthy but oh well. The benedicts are great too. They have a big selection of drinks including various bloody Mary's, beer and I think other cocktails as well but I haven't ordered any. Looks like a great spot for families and groups. Highly recommended if you're in the area."}
{"text":"A few months ago, my husband and I stumbled on this place through \"Yelp\" saw some  delicous pancakes and wanted to give it a try. Plus, the name just sounds \"Unique\" 
The wait time was about 15 - 20 minutes for a brunch sunday and we were happy to wait - no rush! We already knew what we wanted to order and did their Strawberry Cheesecake pancakes, Pork confit Benedict and 5 egg bacon omelet. Their Strawberry Cheesecake pancake was super delicious and we shared it as our pupu style - soo good. I had their Pork Confit Benedict, which was okay just needed a little more of the Hollandaise sauce. 
Given that it was a sunday brunch and it was pretty packed in there, I understand service would be a little slower than usual and our waitress kept forgetting to bring certain items that we requested from her - like water, forks, ketchup, and hollandaise sauce. We had to ask the buster if he can help us and he happily assisted us by the time she came back to give us our items, we were done and ready to close out our check and head out. 
If we do go back it'll be just to have the Strawberry Cheesecake to share!"}
{"text":"\"So are you guys ready to order food or what?\" -Kate 
We hadn't been there more than 5 minutes... Then when we finally got her back to the table to ask for the check she was silent. The last thing she said was \"do you want a box or something?\" Bad service, really bad. Got the BLT which was pretty decent but cut up my mouth with how over toasted the bread was. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great server! Great flavors! Variety of items on the menu! Not a single complaint. They even made me a large iced vanilla soy latte and it was delish!"}
{"text":"The most overrated and overpriced brunch place around. Four of us had brunch at 1245 pm on a Tuesday and it was 90% empty. Seating and service were fine but some of the food was nasty. The sandwiches were fine but the 'Cuban', highly recommended, was fatty. My Omelet was over cooked and stingy on the fillings. Ditto on the hash browns. When the waitress asked how everything was we told her nicely, and she said 'so sorry' and left. Would've been nice to see a manager. Almost $30 each couple plus tip. Save your money and go to Denny's."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch today.   It was my first time in.  We waited forever for the waitress to come and get our drink order.   When our waitress brought our ice tea, mine had no ice in it.   I had to ask for a glass of ice to add to my warm tea.   It took a few minutes to get the extra ice.   We then waited 15 minutes for the waitress to come back and take our food order.   She apologized for the wait.    Then we waited for the food and drink refills.   I believe she might be new, but clearly,  her training was not adequate.   She apologized for all the waiting when she gave us our bill.   Then she came back three times in a short period to ask if it was ready for her to take.   Too bad she hadn't come back to the table once while we had our food to see if we needed anything.

 The food was good, but the service ruined it."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this place. I wanted to like it, especially since I'm a bacon lover. Food just wasn't on point; lacked flavor, spices but portions are huge! I believe our server pocketed the check and forgot to place our order as it took 30 mins to get an 2 omelettes. I will not be going back.."}
{"text":"The food here is great, some of the prices are out of line. $10.95 for a bacon flight of 8 slices of bacon, come on man.  You walk in and the first thing you notice is a color scheme right out of a 70's horror movie, yellow and puke lime green. This place needs a face lift and rebranding for sure. Very noisy with lots of families with little kids. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, even though we could see about 5 tables that were empty and just needed to be cleaned. Clearly if it wasn't someones job to clean a table they were not going to do it. There were even a couple of spots at the bar that were empty but dirty because the bartender wouldn't clean them off. With all these negatives why did I still give it 4 stars. Because the food was delicious and the service was good once we were seated."}
{"text":"When I heard about this place, I know I needed to try it! I love new breakfast places and when I heard they had mimosa flights and bacon flights?! SOLD.

When first arriving at the place the one thing that was super overwhelming was how LOUD it is in there. I mean, sports bar in the middle of the Super Bowl LOUD. I thought maybe it would be better once we got seated but it didn't. 

And what's up with the LIME green paint everywhere?? 
Didn't fit their theme at all, I thought. 

While we were waiting for the table, the hostess was not very friendly. We were the only party waiting for a table but soon after we arrived there must have been  6 different parties. It got so busy! And the waiting area is so so small, so it was a squeeze and most parties were waiting outside in the heat but Since it was our first time, I took it as \"wow this place is busy so it must be delicious\" 

Once we got seated in a booth, we noted to our waitress that it was our first time at the establishment she didn't even seem to care, didn't explain the mimosa flight flavors when I asked or the bacon flights- which is what the advertise for everywhere. I might not have been able to hear her anyways cause again, IT WAS SO LOUD! 

I ordered a mimosa flight and my husband ordered a Bloody Mary. They were both decently priced I thought; but quickly discovered overpriced for what we received. Mimosa flight was really underwhelming, I only really liked two of the flavors, which I can't even tell you what they are because our waitress didn't explain and never saw it on the menu (except the big chalkboard menu in the middle of the restaurant).  My husband said the best part about the Bloody Mary was the bacon it had in it. 

As for food, my husband ordered French toast. Which he said was good (not great) portions were good. I got the Tempe omelette, which was drenched in some weird tasting sauce. I ended up scraping some of the sauce off. The hash browns/home fries were good. Omelette was ok. 

We would probably go again to try this place one more time before we completely rule it off our list. Definitely wasn't my favorite though."}
{"text":"The bacon flight and the mimosa flights are amazing. The whole brunch menu looks delicious. My only complaint is that the restaurant can get very loud with only a few big parties."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out because of the flight of bacon .. it was okay, I don't think it was worth the $10... the pecan wood and jalapeño bacon was our favorite.. the service was good we got seated right away and our waitress did check up on us quite often... but I feel like the food itself was average, nothing really stood out..."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my food. I have been to the other location plenty of times and have been overly satisfied but this barely held up to that. My bbq pork sandwich was super fatty, salty in some places, and bland in others. The pork barely tasted like bbq. I crave this sandwich! And i was so let down to have paid $12 for goop :c"}
{"text":"What constitutes a five star rating, you ask? I believe, cleanliness, service, taste, quality, and a touch of intrigue to the menu are all items which contribute to a fantastic restaurant--The Oink Cafe has every one of these attributes plus more. More would be their nine different types of bacons, what? Mind blown, I know! This is a great place to pick for breakfast or brunch with family, friends, or colleagues. Loved every bite!"}
{"text":"First time here. Got seated right away. Hesitated to order the eggs Benedict because I have another place that is so good But I am so glad I did!
The eggs were perfectly poached and the shaved ham made them easy to eat and delicious! These were the best ever!My mate had biscuits and gravy which was huge with four biscuits! Very nice hash browns too. Liked our waitress Mo. they use shamrock products which means quality to me.Even iced tea was freshly brewed and perfecto
Place was clean. It seemed a little dark which is less inviting to me
.They serve alcohol even a mimosa flight. Cool"}
{"text":"IMPORTANT: Check your water before drinking!!! Today they seemed to be under staffed but we we were seated before 3 other groups and we were never greeted.  Eventually after all the other groups after us placed there order we were asked have we been helped. Seems servers do not have sections that they wait on. On top of that the water was murky and not filtered. Told a waiter and she said she would provide us with new glasses...never came back. Didnt even want to try and drink from it. We ordered a 1/2 flight of bacon which all tasted the same...no difference what so ever. Bacon was basic bacon...Very disappointed in our visit and don't believe I will be coming back."}
{"text":"We do keep coming back here because we live only a mile from here and our kids loves this place....like I said there's 7 of us. Bob, the manager and Cassidy has become one the people the keeps up coming back. The hostess girls are always so nice to us and the rest of the staff are great as well. The food, here, are delicious as well. They do tend to be very busy so if you don't have the time to wait, then this isn't the place for you. Their prime is from 9 -11 am on the weekends. They do try to have a very quick turn around time and the girls are always friendly. I love their chorizo bene...instead of the pattie chorizo I ask for the crumble which tastes better. I also love their burito chimi with extra cheese chorizo on the side. My kids loves their oink French toast, cinnamon roll with a side of the Apple wood bacon. My other half always orders their regular bene. Their California Mac Salad is still a favorite but I feel like it still should be a side. It needs to be eaten with a sandwich or burger. I know there's chicken in the mac but its not enough protein in my opinion. They offer different kids of flights - Bacon, Mimosas, Beer and Bloody Mary. I've done 3 of the 4. My other half haven't tried the Beer...not sure why. We do love their Bacon flights...favorite is the Jalapeno Bacon and I do love their Oink Bloody Mary. This place is one of our go to to place for breakfast. We take our out of town family & friends here and they always tend to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I wanted a good breakfast with hashbrowns and Oink delivered.

I ordered the PV omelet with spinach, swiss, bacon and mushrooms.  It was great.  You get a side of bread, which includes the biscuit.  A great biscuit.  Yet the reason I went was for hash browns. Very crispy and tasted great.  

The wife got the California Benedict. It was very good with avocados inside.  

I am glad this place is nearby!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was finally glad to have a new breakfast spot open up in the neighborhood as a few in the area have become a big disappointment. Its gotten so bad that I do an occasional brunch at my house that is off the hook making me wanna open up a catering business... but that's another convo for another day. We had a short wait but the front area can be congested as its only a few seats insides to wait... they will need to figure that out before summer as they are facing the sun in the am making it hot and bright. Got the bacon and mimosa flight and found 3 bacons I would come back for. They overcooked a few which made them taste a lot alike, but still enjoyable. Stuck with the basic pancakes/eggs/bacon plate. Decent size, but kinda wanted more. Plan to come again to try the French toast with jalapeño bacon. We also had the BLT... it needed some more sauce as it was dry, but I think it was because the bacon was overcooked. If your claiming the 'oink' you gotta come correct with how you prepare it... some like it medium, some like it crisp... they probably need to ask 'how do you like your bacon'"}
{"text":"Service was horrible! I called in an order at 10:13, I was literally across the street at a SB cafe relaxing, I walked over at 10:30 am, walked up to the bar, 2 ladies were busy fixing a receipt on the register, 3rd lady was behind the bar, I was greeted for a pickup by a 4th waitress, provided my name, got my check, paid and saw they were busy figuring something out, so I told her no rush. At 10:43, I had to catch someone and inquire about my to go order, the rude lady behind the bar, must have forgotten, she went to the kitchen to check, came back and said it will be a few more minutes, puzzled, I mentioned to her that it had already been at least 30 minutes since I called it in. She countered, I'll check the time, seriously lady, as if I would lie, I held up my phone, smiled and said, phones don't lie! At 10:52, I continued to sit at the bar, waiting, then I had to catch another waitress walking by, asked her to cancel my order at 10:56. The hostess finally came over and was shocked that I cancelled, although she was very nice about it, I informed her of the time and that I shouldn't have to wait over 40 min for a phoned in order. I only ordered oatmeal, side of bacon, Turkado Benedict sandwich. I really wish I was able to taste what they had to offer, but I think 45-50 min waiting time is certainly unreasonable for a phone in, if I were sitting at a table, that would be really ridiculous and the waitress working the bar today, should never have contact with People, better yet, I wouldn't want her preparing my meal with such a distasteful attitude and when I was getting my refund, she still had the nerve to state her opinion with her back turned. I hope management pays attention to the comments, this one the one time I failed to read the reviews for this restaurant, it appears to be an issue with staff and service."}
{"text":"They are new to the neighborhood so we thought we would give it a try. It was OK but not really impressed with any of it. Our chicken sandwich was missing the avacado but the flavor was good, and for the spinach salad the dressing was all oil no balsamic to be seen. Probably not a place we will go again."}
{"text":"First time here. Got the Arizona Omelet with  chorizo and a bacon flight. Absolutely the best omelette I've ever had. Can't wait to try the Mimosa Flight. I like the little bar area as well. Nice friendly atmosphere. I didn't have any noise issues. I love the green because it's actually my favorite color. Very vibrant decor all around. I will definitely have to come back and try all the items on the menu and possibly try to sit outside."}
{"text":"We have been anxious to try the Oink Cafe and it did not disappoint! The restaurant was quite busy, but our server was friendly and helpful. The Bacon Flight was delicious! So little pricey, yes. But it's fun, tasty and not something we would order every visit. The Bloody Mary Flight was also delicious, unique and all four drinks had quite a kick. We will definitely order this again!  The omelet was stuffed with ingredients and was tasty. The hashbrowns were cooked crispy and the chicken fried steak was, like everything else, cooked perfectly. Unlike some reviewers, I liked the design of the place...bright, upbeat and fun! As for the notice level, it is quite noisy...but not so loud that we couldn't have a conversation. We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"This location is perfect for me! I love all the different types of bacon, $2.99 for 2 pieces of bacon is a little pricey but the food is really good. Biscuits and gravy are bland and more sweet than savory but the eggs Benedict and cappuccinos are great!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  I had the chimichanga  which was so good and huge!  The chorizo queso sauce on top was amazing. Too much for one person. I suggest sharing  this one.  The bacon eggs benedict was also quite good.  Eggs poached perfectly.  Bacon flights--Mimosa flights.  Wow. Our server Ryan was very helpful as it was our first time here.  He was very knowledgeable for menu suggestions and answered all of our questions. We were there on a Tuesday,  No waiting and quick efficient service.  Anybody who goes out on the weekend should know they will wait here as with any restaurant that is good. We have lots of out of town visitors.  Cant what to take m son in law here.  I will be his new best friend! One of our new favorite places!!"}
{"text":"Yum.  Order a bacon flight.  Or a mimosa flight.  Or a Bloody Mary flight.  1st time here.  I will definitely be back.  Had the Breakfast chimi. Wanted to try about 10 items.  Open breakfast and lunch.  Both served all day"}
{"text":"First visit this past weekend 
Extremely packed 
I personally am a HUGE bacon lover , but the bacon fleight they gave me seemed to have been bacon that was just sitting there for awhile ...
Hmmm probably won't be coming back as much as i love bacon."}
{"text":"PROS
-Bacon flight! 8 different types of bacon, all crispy and nice flavor. Easily shareable
-Our server was helpful

CONS
-Service at the bar was jammed, they needed more help. Took oforever to get 2 bloody marys and 2 mimosas 
-Wait time, 40 min for table of 4...What an insane wait for such average food, not even half way done with our drinks we ordered a nother roudn to avoid the extended wait time
-Entrees were mostly very heavy and overwhelming
-Noticed that multiple tables were not cleaned and their turn around time for table was way too long, they are not properly staffed

We won't be coming back as it seems to be still new and shiny, the crowds are annoying for an average brunch place."}
{"text":"The hostess didn't even bother to look when my group of four walked up to her. We immediately went at sat at the bar and she then came dashing over with attitude suggesting we were in the wrong for going and sitting down. The service was as mediocre as the food. Our bartender disappeared. We had to ask for a to-go box twice and had to remind the bartender that our checks were separate three times. This breakfast was painful."}
{"text":"We went back for a late breakfast for the 3rd time on a Sunday, and Oink was right on track as usual... sat at the big high top table for our medium size group... quick service even though bustling... got the flight of bacon again, which was sooo yummy... nice to try different flavors... everyone's food was perfect... large portions, so had to take some home for snacks later... a nice addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was great and it is 3 star worthy. It had flavor, it was cooked right and with plenty of menu options to satisfy an entire croud. Prices are decent for the portions they provide you.
Opportunities: customer service, our waiter did not check on us often and we had empty coffee cups for most of the meal. It took about 50 minutes to get our food ready after we placed the order, with no coffee this seemed like an eternity.
We witnessed the waitress clean the chairs butt section with a rag and then reusing the same rag to clean the table top, that's just not within regulations I am sure. 
Ambiance: it was a little noisy and the colors are a bit bright, the colors are fine but the noise levels made it hard to keep a conversation going.
Not sure if we will be returning customers if the customer service is not corrected."}
{"text":"Honestly, when I first heard the name of this place, I found it unappealing.  I thought maybe it was a barbeque place, but upon discussion with a friend, found out it was a breakfast/lunch joint.  Ok, now things are getting interesting. We have a serious lack of good breakfast places in this area of town so I though \"why not?\".  I went on a Friday morning about 10:45 a.m. It took me a few minutes to look over the menu, but I decided that I wanted to try the Oink Cafe French Toast since I had perused the menu online just a few days before. 

I'd say the restaurant was about 1/3 full which doesn't explain why I waited about 20 minutes to get my food. Disappointment #1. Then the food is room temperature...great.  Disappointment #2.  I was really looking forward to trying this because the picture on the website looks UH-MAZING. Nope. Looked nothing like it. As the server sets the food down, they mention that \"here is your french toast coated in Cap 'n' Crunch\". What?!?!?! I clearly missed that on the menu. I asked is that what it said on the menu? Because I missed that part. She says yes. Hmmmmm. Fortunately, I took a pic of the menu and it does NOT say that. The menu says \"a sweet crumb crust\". I was thinking maybe a brown sugar crumble or perhaps a cinnamon and sugar sprinkling. I don't like Cap 'n' Crunch. Disappointment #3.  Be careful when ordering and ask specific questions.

The presentation was horrible. Very boring and uncreative. The only positive was that the  bacon was thick and tasty even if it was cold.  I guess hence the name \"Oink\".  If you want a platter of bacon, this is your place, but I wouldn't recommend this place unless you don't care where you eat. I can only imagine the service and food if the place was crowded!

Next time I'll hit up Denny's where I know the food will be piping hot, I get a lot more for my buck and the wait is next to nothing. Nice try Oink, but I don't see you lasting long."}
{"text":"It was ok. Ordered the Bacon benedict with the honey bacon, tasted like regular bacon. I thought maybe the wrong bacon was put on the plate but the waitress said that it wasn't a sweet bacon. Hubby got the Paradise Valley omelet, he enjoyed it very much.  The home fries were very crunchy and tasty. Service was ok, not great but not bad. The hostess did look like she just woke up and threw on whatever was available, a little off putting. If in the area might give another try but not going out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Meh, it was fine .. bacon very thin.. I was expecting meatier pieces of bacon .. just an average experience .."}
{"text":"Having driven by a few times, we finally stopped by. It was a 15-20 minute wait on a Sunday morning which is to be expected. Once seated, our server Mo was prompt and gave great recommendations. We ordered a flight of mimosas and a flight of bloody Mary's to start. Both delicious. For the meal we had eggs benedict and a breakfast chimi. Very good portions, I had to take half my chimi home. Food was very good and the menu had enough variety and uniqueness so we'll most definitely be back."}
{"text":"My favorite new breakfast place to go to with my sister! The service is great and the food comes out very quickly. Their breakfast sandwich is amazing and not to mention the variety of types of bacon they offer! Jasmine was my server today and she was amazing. Answered my sisters questions regarding the menu and was incredibly nice. Met the owners, Bob and Desiree, and they were so humble! If you're looking for a new breakfast/lunch place near by, I highly recommend giving this place a try. Nothing is better than great food and great service!"}
{"text":"First time to this new location. I only had to wait about 5-10 minutes for a table at 9am on a Sunday. Service was fast and the food was so tasty. Order the Oink Cafe French Toast. You won't be disappointed. The variety of bacon is pretty good too."}
{"text":"It would be more like 2.75 stars if I could. I'll start out by saying that the service was great. I sat at the bar and our food came out within 20 minutes of ordering, which is pretty usual. 
My complaints lie with the pricing with their specialty items. 
I got the Bacon Flight, of course, and my favorite was the Jalapeño flavor and my friend liked the Apple Cider version and the Pecanwood flavor. The rest of the bacon \"flavors\" tasted like normal bacon... disappointing for $12, but still a fun idea. My friend got the Bloody Mary flight and I got the mimosa flight. Again, fun idea, but poorly executed in my opinion. They use V8 juice for their mixers and it's so basic, so they should not charge $11...The Bloody Mary flight was a bit better with some unique flavors, especially the tomatillo, cucumber and jalapeño green version. But again, the rest are made with regular V8 tomato juice, so pretty bland.  Another interesting thing, they have no drink menu, so they have to rattle off the flavors of the flights to each person. Seems like a time-waster.
In my opinion, I was not impressed enough to return. If you're going to charge premium prices, the quality of your ingredients should be Premium as well, i.e. Fresh squeezed juices and ingredients, etc.
Biscuits and gravy were fine, but those are pretty difficult to mess up.  Again, $8.99 for two biscuits and gravy seems a little steep when you only get one choice of side with it, and add $2 if you want eggs with your breakfast, which lets face it, most of us do!
Best of luck to those great bartenders though, they were absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to The Oink twice and chose one of the benedicts both times. Absolutely lovely breakfast - not too huge - not too heavy. Friendly quick service, coffee and water refilled as a matter of course."}
{"text":"This place was recommended because my hubby loves bacon. Parking was easy and convenient to entrance that's a plus. We had no wait we were seated right away. We started with bacon and mimosa flight. The bacon is ok it's fun it comes on a piggy board. The mimosas need some work, don't bother with a flight if they all taste the same. The Oink French toast is ok very very sweet. The shredded pork Omelet was less than what we expected. We would go back and try lunch"}
{"text":"Easily became one of my top spots for brunch! I went two weekends ago with a friend and we got the mimosa and Bloody Mary flights. They were delish! We split the Mac n cheese and a Cuban sandwich, both were great. I brought another friend this weekend and we got a bacon 1/2 flight and breakfast. Service was great both times. There was a wait both weekends but was much shorter the second time when we went much earlier. #worthit"}
{"text":"This breakfast place was pretty good. I've been wanting to try it for a while. The food was good, but I thought the service was a bit slow, although it didn't look like there was very many staff working that morning. I would still go back, but I enjoy a lot of other places first."}
{"text":"Has an interior paint job that makes you question their choices and want to throw up. Out of beans and overall mediocre food and service. Decent iced tea."}
{"text":"If you like bacon, this is your breakfast spot. They have bacon flights!! I didn't know that was even out in the universe. Hooray for bacon! They have every kind from maple to pepper to jalapeño bacon. My favorite was the jalapeño, but they are all bacon so they are all delicious of course. 

It's standard breakfast aside from that. Everything was good with the exception of the biscuits. I prefer a light fluffy biscuit and these were SO heavy. Solid dough. 

The service was great. We had a lovely lady named Susie, who was genuinely friendly vs robotic service at most establishments. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Food is average.  Waitress seemed irritated when when greeting us on our last few visits.  Service is often disjointed even when business is slow."}
{"text":"The first time we went it was good until the end when we needed boxes to go and our check. The waitress with purple hair stood at a table and talked for a good 10 minutes and never looked up.  The second time was ok with nothing outstanding but the service was good. Today we went at 7 am and had good service. The flight of bacon was ok and our over medium eggs were over easy. The biscuits and gravy tasted left over.  This will be our last visit to The Oink.  We spent $38 for 2 of us not counting the tip."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool, if you love bacon you have to stop. They had about 8 types of bacon, which you could order a flight of and they also had 6 kinds of Bloody Marys that you could order a flight of. The food was good, but the hash browns were greasy, crunchy on top but undercooked on the inside. All in all our breakfast and service was very good."}
{"text":"Ah, New Year's Eve. We're about to leave 2016 behind and enter into 2017. Of course, by the time this is posted, it'll be 2017 already and in that case: HAPPY NEW YEAR!

So I took 2.5 flights out of this dumpster fire known as 2016. I had a good Mimosa Flight (OJ, blueberry pomegranate, strawberry, and mango peach), an amazing Bloody Mary Flight (Verde Bloody Mary made with vodka, salted rim, and garnished with tomatillo, cucumber, and jalapeño; Spicy Thai Sriracha made with Sriracha, vodka, salted Sriracha rim, and garnished with jalapeño; The Oink Bloody Mary made with The Oinked house Bloody Mary mix, vodka, bacon salted rim, and garnished with a bacon strip, celery, green olive, lemon and lime; and the Bloody Maria made with Cholula, 100% Agave Tequila, salted rim, and garnished with a lime and chicharrón), and a decadent half Bacon Flight (applewood, hickory, jalapeño, and chef's choice of pecanwood). I also ordered the Pork Confit Benedict [Toasted English muffin, Chef's special pork confit with poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce] and nibbled on some Huevos Rancheros [Two eggs on corn tortillas covered with a spicy homemade ranchero sauce served with beans and a flour tortilla]. Least to say, I had a two-hour food coma before leaving 2016 behind!

The food here is great. My eggs for the benedict were a bit over cooked but the tender pork confit made it easy to forgive the cook. Also, they were super generous with the hollandaise sauce which makes my heart happy (and probably a little clogged). The Huevos Ranchero had a good amount of heat and was flavorful. I'd probably skip the Bacon Flight if I came back.  It was a bit underwhelming but a great concept for bacon lovers.  I'd love to come back to try their Biscuits & Gravy and their Mac & Cheese!

All in all, The Oink Cafe was a great way to end the year. Service was amazing given how insanely busy it was, food was tasty, and the lime green walls were both horrendous and charming. I dig The Oink Cafe! 3.5 stars easily."}
{"text":"If you like breakfast, bacon, burgers, bacon, and carbs... this is your heaven.  The jalapeno bacon is AMAZING.  Great place for family meals, groups, lunch - a happening spot where you will probably see someone you know.  Friendly and efficient staff who remember everyone, manager (and owner!) often checking in on guests.  We LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Went in this place on a Saturday. It wasn't too early in the morning and we didn't have to wait for a table at all. The place is clean and the service was great. The manager came to our table to ask how everything was, I feel like restaurants aren't doing that as much anymore. It was nice to see. The pricing was SUPER reasonable and we ate a lot of food and it was less than $40.  I will definitely be going back! Great place!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. I understand Sunday brunch is busy but this place needs help. We waited for a table for 45 min. Pretty standard on a Sunday, especially since there were 7 of us. No big deal. We were seated and promptly greeted. Drink order was taken and our server ( young lady with bright orange eye shadow)came right back with drinks and set the entire tray on the table. We helped ourselves to our drinks because  she had walked away. No biggie. She came over about 10 minutes later and took our order. We watched her write everything down. The food comes out 40 minutes later. It's now almost noon and we've been here since 10. This is a bit ludicrous  considering almost all of our food was wrong. The food runner had a HUGE attitude. My sister (who's bday it is) said she wanted crispy hash browns and this girl literally rolls her eyes. Seriously? My niece asked for no butter on her English muffin, it came with butter, my bro in law never got his eggs, and I never got my flight of bacon. We had to flag down a mgr and he says...\"I know what happened to your meal and I'm going to take some money off the bill. I asked the owner \". So...the owner was there, knew there were a lot of problems with a 7 top, and yet never came over? That's horrible business. Horrible. I asked if I was going to get my bacon, you know, their speciality? The mgr goes, oh Yeah! But sadly, never came back. Orange eye shadow NEVER came to check on us again. We got the bill, he took 50% off the bill BUT charged us for all the food we didn't get. What an awful experience and I will assure you, this place just lost at least 7 customers plus whoever we all tell."}
{"text":"Tried this with a friend of mine. I had the Eggs Benedict with spinach. Service was not great. We seemed to annoy the waitress with needing our coffee swapped out after putting in creamer that curdled. Nasty. 
She never apologized for it or said anything. Just seems irritated that she has to get us new coffee. 
Breakfast was sub par. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Their bacon was heavenly.....oh mama....

This isn't a big restaurant. When we arrived, the line was literally out the door waiting for a table. The service was limited in the morning only because they were extremely busy. I ordered their orange juice and it was fresh squeeze. I regretted ordering a small glass instead of a large. It was so good.....For breakfast, I ordered a Begrime Waffles with eggs and link sausages. It was absolutely delicious. I also took a bite of the benedict. The sauce was rich and tasty. The best of the best was the bacon plates that came with 8 different flavor you can choose from. If you do not know which smoke flavor you would like the best, you have got to order this.

Overall, their breakfast was awesome. I will most definitely come back here again. It was totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"What an awesome breakfast spot! Stopped in here while visiting a friend and as a fan of bacon (I mean who isn't) this place was a heaven sent. 

Everything on the menu looks completely delicious I has the chimi was way bigger than expected! But the real star of the show for us was the flights. We had a bacon flight and a Mimosa flight. There is something magical about someone placing a plate of bacon in front of you. 

The mimosa was more champagne than juice and I am not complaining. 

This will definitely become a most stop on my many visits to Phoenix"}
{"text":"this place is Great. I have gone twice recently last weekend a group of 4 of us came.  Are server was friendly and on top of things. We all loved the food we received and will be back. I went today with a group of 10 people. again we  had great service and all thought the food was excellent and everyone was talking about when we are coming back again."}
