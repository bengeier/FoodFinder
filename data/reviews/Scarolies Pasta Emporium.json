{"text":"If you like Olive Garden-style Italian food, this place is for you. Lot's of stuff on the menu but unfortunately none of it is very good. Pizza's are OK I suppose. Portions are very good if your preference is quantity over quality. The decor is a bit tacky if you ask me."}
{"text":"We celebrated our son's 19th birthday on Wednesday night at Scarolies's. This was my fourth time eating at the restaurant. One thing I can state is that the food is delicious & the service is outstanding! Well worth the wait. This last time there was an error with the meal my brother had ordered. The restaurant had run out of some of the items required for the meal. They sure 'made it right' for my brother. Great service!! If you are looking for a great experience I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sauce tastes canned. Service is meh. Great if you don't know about how great Italian food should be, perfect for the plethora of anglos in the area. Pasta was overcooked too. At least the bread they serve you at the beginning is warm. If a friend has a party here I usually just skip it, theres better Italian along StJeans, no need to waste time and money here in my opinion."}
{"text":"I usually take the Table d'hote specials and really enjoy them. Their pasta dishes are very flavorful and the portion size is amazing. The crispy hot bread is delicious! Service is what always brings us back to this place."}
{"text":"Carbonara pizza is delisous. Take a look at the floors when your there. Wear good footware"}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I've been to this place, and I always come out with a great experience! Beautiful decor on the inside, amazing service, and simply delicious food. And the sizes of those cakes, ohh boy, save room for dessert!
In short - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on the good Yelp reviews - and weren't dissappointed! Selection, quality, quantity and service all excellent! There on a Sun. a bit before the busiest time so no problem getting in! Would love to go again when we are visiting from Ottawa."}
{"text":"My gf and I read excellent reviews of this place so we wanted to try it.  We had a mixed bag.  Her food was \"bland\" almost flavorless and was lacking some of the advertised ingredients (from the menu), my food was delicious.  One thing they did was to bring us extra large beverages and then charged us extra for them even if we ordered the smaller size.  We didn't make a fuss about that.  The noise level was too high.  It was easier to hear several conversations from across the room than to chat with my gf.  Perhaps it's too popular for its own good.  I don't think we'd be back."}
{"text":"The plates are generous and well presented. The service was excellent. The prices are very reasonable. We really enjoyed our evening here."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful smoked salmon salad over a year ago and so I went back in hoping to see if it was still on the menu.
When it was not, I just had to ask the waiter about it and he was more than happy to ask the kitchen crew if they could whip one up for me.
I was quite happy to learn that the kitchen was very willing to prepare it for me.
It was even bigger and more satisfying than the last one.

It is not like I am a regular, I have only been in 3 times in the last 2 years.
Keep up the great work
I really appreciated this attentive customer service..."}
{"text":"If your looking for great Italian appetizers, pasta dishes and meat dishes, look no further, Scarolies is your stop! It's been years that I've been coming to scarolies. The service is exceptional and the food is delicious! They also make outstanding pizza if your not in the mood for pasta or steak. The pasta, meat and pizza portions are perfect! They also serve pipping hot bread that is baked on premises.The managers of the restaurant are awesome! There always there taken care of quality and service. Make sure you call for reservations, the place is always packed! I drive 30 minutes to come eat here. Well worth the trip! Every time! Hats off scarolies, awesome Italian food."}
{"text":"Love this resto - especially their Chillean Sea Bass when they have it - its like butter,
Can be a bit noisy during busy times - I often go for a late lunch and you get the lunch prices and if you order pasta you usually have enought for supper or lunch the next day...

Have been told the service is iffy during the Holiday season..."}
{"text":"Delicious complimentary baguette bread! Large portions of tasty food, for ok prices. The place is always full! The waiters are very kind and patient. This is definitely not the place to eat at if you're on a diet: it's full of creamy, greasy stuff, but very tasty and tempting of course too!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. Good service. Good food. Never disappointed. The fresh hot bread that they bring to your table is to die for. That could be my meal! Have tried many different things on the menu and everything is always good."}
{"text":"Menu exhaustif de plats de pâtes, portions gigantesques. Vous pourrez en rapporter pour un lunch le lendemain! Grande salle à manger, plutôt bruyant, repas de familles et de groupes. Mon entrée d'aubergines était très ordinaire, sans goût, j'en ai à peine mangé. L'entrée de calmars frits était bien malgré la sauce plutôt fade.  Ma fille a adoré son fettucini alfredo et j'ai aimé mes pâtes aux tomates séchées, champignons et prosciutto, mon copain a aussi apprécié ses pâtes. Attention beaucoup de crème ds la préparation de plusieurs plats de pâtes."}
{"text":"Another regular place for me when I'm in town for work. The salads and bread are quite good, and the pasta is delicious and very plentiful. I wish the wine selection was better. The service is impeccable."}
{"text":"Fettuccine DE Scalopinos - awesome!

Meat lasagna - awesome!

Great service and good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Bons pratos de massas, o atendimento do Joe foi muito bom tb e atencioso. 
Detalhes: O prato serve duas pessoas que nao estejam com muita fome, descobrimos isso na tentativa...."}
{"text":"Always great service and food. Love the bread! I had the calimari and lobster ravioli."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is very good and we had a nice family outing. 
I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants some good Italian. 

We went there with our kids and they too had fun as are well. 

If you are in the area then u should pass-by."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites, they have some amazing dishes, my number one being the seafood pasta, mmmm

I don't live in Montreal anymore, but when I am in town, I always try to drop by.

You won't regret it !!!"}
{"text":"Really best place ever
Amazing food 
Excellent prices
Super services , very accommodating 
Highly highly recommended ."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time with a party of 10 to celebrate a family member's birthday. 

The interior design is outstanding. Very clean with white aproned servers and a semi-open kitchen (you can see the chefs from the shoulders up but not what they're cooking).

The food was absolutely delicious. Huge portions served in beautiful presentations. 

Service was attentive and for the most part professional. Our waiter must have been new because he seemed to become overwhelmed mid-way through the service but a very perceptive manager stepped in to pick up the slack. 

Definitely want to explore their menu further."}
{"text":"What a dump!

I ordered the chicken marsala pasta and what arrived at my table was completely unedable, it at the same texture and taste as gravy on dehydrated pasta noodles, the chicken was processed and completely gross. 

So nasty, my wife left her supper half eaten as well, lemon chicken piccata, again, processed chicken coved in nasty dehydrated sauce. 

When the bill arrived and it was over $50 for 2 people I wanted to sue someone. what a complete rip off! their strategy seems to be, fill these idiots up on low grade cheap white bread and pray to god they are full and don't notice how terrible our low grade main courses are. 

Please avoid, unless of course there is something wrong with your mouth or you have too much money in your wallet that you need to get rid of."}
{"text":"The food was good but don't expect to go there looking for healthy stuff, lots of carbs, lots of oil, lots of salt. We live once so enjoy yourself once in a while :)"}
{"text":"Scarolies is one of my favorite places to go for a nice Saturday night dinner. Out of the many times I've been, the food has been out of this world so I can depend on it for a nice dinner night out. 

They have all kinds of pasta dishes to suit everybody's tastes alongside some other dishes if you feel like having something else like a luxurious rack of lamb or a nicely made pizza.

When seated, you are brought a baguette sliced at your table with olive oil and balsamic vinegar to hold back your hunger until the main course. As for the pasta itself, I've never not enjoyed a pasta dish there myself and they have a large variety. Pastas from basic spaghetti and meatballs to a seafood linguini with scallops, mussels, clams and jumbo shrimps.

The portion size is large and the prices are very reasonable for what you get. You can easily spend under $20 and bring food home for lunch tomorrow!

Scarolies is very worth it and is a unique experience and accessible as its right across from the Fairview terminus.

Should you find yourself with extra time for lunch or want a nice outing, drop by Scarolies Pasta Emporium"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! This is the truly Italian restaurant. I'm from Dallas TX and every time I'm in town on business trip I always have to come here and order \"Capelli d' Angelo con Scalope e Gamberi\". The servers are very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Big portions for good food, for a good price. No wonder why they're packed even on a Wednesday night!

Nice interior with chandeliers, tall Roman-like columns, and ceilings painted like the sky. Perfect for families and large groups... But wouldn't recommend for a quiet dinner with your bae. 

For starters, try the fried calamari - fresh and crispy. Or the fried zucchini - big pieces of freshly breaded zucchini (served with a strange goopy sauce tho). Both excellent! 

The antipasti plate was alright but nothing to rave about. Same with the dinner entrees unfortunately. From the grilled salmon to the spaghetti bolognese, all of our entrees where a bit underwhelming. 

While the dinners were cooked perfectly, everything seemed to be under seasoned. The bolognese didn't have enough meat, the red sauce was under seasoned, the salmon was bland... But everything was cooked so nicely! And presentation was on point too! 

Scarolies just needs a little more umph to their food and sauces. Hands down I would award them another star if the food was jazzed up just a smidgen more. Still a great Italian establishment in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Definitely not authentic Italian food but that's what you'd expect from an Italian restaurant in the West Island. Portions are good and the service is great."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years whenever I'm in town and generally leave very impressed.  I most recently ate here a couple of days ago and while it wasn't the best experience, I still stand by this place.

This place can get busy and noisy at dinner time, so I generally elect to come a little earlier.  Plus, it also allows me to order of the menu of the day which includes salad and dessert - a steal in my opinion.  Service can be spotty but is generally good - I see the same staff over and over so the restaurant has good enough owners to keep staff there over the years.

Food is yummy and includes all you can eat bread.  There are lots of options to choose from and prices on the menu are fairly typical for Canadian Italian.

Overall, this place has always been memorable and hard to replicate for me in my own city so I do enjoy coming here.  I wasn't thrilled about the $3 sauce change charged to my bill the other day or the not as fresh bread, but I still think this place offers some pretty great food in Pointe Claire."}
{"text":"North American Italian style food that tastes decent. If you want authentic Italian food this is not the place. If you just feel like pasta this will do. The portion are huge. Price per person is not cheap but when you consider that most people do 2 meals (since they take the leftover home) the price is pretty good."}
{"text":"Updated:

I hadn't been to Scarolie's for quite some time but stopped in this past weekend for dinner. I ordered the grilled shrimp with rice and roasted vegetables. The dish was underwhelming and a major fail for me. It was obvious just by looking at the roasted vegetables that these had been re-warmed or re-grilled; they were certainly not cooked recently because they were very dry and they just looked OLD. They also lacked in flavor so I didn't even eat them. The wild rice was very good but then, it's not that hard to make rice. I'm not sure about the shrimp - I got the feeling that they weren't grilled right before serving the dish because they were a little tough. Taste-wise, they were OK, but I've had better tasting, and more succulent shrimp at Scarolie's in the past. Definitely not impressed with this meal."}
{"text":"It was very busy and it seemed to have lots of happy faces. The ambience is nice for a family night out or for a celebration. I had tomato and bocconcini which was tasty, but there was too much sauce on it. I would have preferred to eat it without sauce. My companions shrimp bisque was overcooked, rubbery and too salty. We also ordered Zuccini sticks and they were really good. As for the mains: I had the Sirloin AAA ordered as medium. It was cooked a little more well done than medium, but the pepper sauce was ok and the french fries were delicious. For my companion, the pasta was cooked fine and it was tasty, but a bit too much sauce. The portions are huge, so you are are probably going home with a doggy bag if you do not bring your appetite.

The service from our waiter was fantastic, which made for a good evening.

Overall an adequate meal at an okay price."}
{"text":"Very pretty interior decor, although somewhat kitch and over the top.
A little run down.
Came here on a week day for lunch with a friend. We were seated next to the only other couple there, which seem to be an old man and his much younger stripper-like \"girlfriend\"...
I felt like I was in a The Sopranos episode!
Waiter brought us a baguette with some oil to dip it in, thank you very much.
I rarely come to restaurants like this.
But I used to all the time as a kid.
A little too theatrical for my taste.
It's a very nice place to bring your grand parents.

I had a pizza and my friend had a creamy seafood linguini, both were good.
Nothing outstanding, but good.

They might wanna repair certain broken things like the air duct grill on the floor which my chair would fall into every time I moved it.

Might come back on a much busier night for dinner, to see the kind of ambiance there is.
But there are so many other places to try out, I probably won't."}
{"text":"Good cheap and consistent. That's all i need in an Italian resto and this place delivers all three."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch here.  A very nice red wine paired well with my pasta dish.  The warm bread is delicious and the portions are enormous.  I ordered the half portion of a pasta primavera. It had mushrooms, peppers, broccoli and spaghetti in a mild tomato cream sauce.  The decor is very cute and I would return to this little gym in a strip mall."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place. Service is great. Endless bread. A great price. Like sure it's not like the most amazing place in the world but it's pretty good to me so I'm not sure why there's such shit reviews. Also the decor is just my favourite kind of tacky. Just a gem."}
{"text":"Waiters weren't friendly and I couldn't finish my sentences when I asking a question. The melon hard and prosciutto was thick cut and old. I returned it, they politely apologized and took it off my bill but said it was fresh. I used to take my grandmother all the time, but it seems they have become more like robots and don't put any love in their food. In general the food was bland and not tasty."}
{"text":"Ambiance, food and service are good!
We were served by Richard (if im not mistaken). He is a young gentleman, very polite and we were very happy the way he served us.

We went there Sunday lunch at 1pm and they are open. However, this yelp account says it is \"close\". I hope someone fix it."}
{"text":"This restaurant took me out of near YELP retirement. After 418 reviews, this one is in the worst 10 of all time! Food was terrible, the service was clumsy at best. I've had better frozen pizza, and the rest... Just avoid. This place shouldn't still be here after this many years."}
{"text":"Great pasta and prices. Very loud when it's busy but the food makes up for the less than desirable atmosphere. They do not take debit, but they have an atm and accept credit cards."}
{"text":"It started wrong. We reserved a table of 8 for 20h45. I arrived 5 minutes earlier, but the table wasn't ready, when I asked them at what time will I get my table they said that I will have to wait for at least 15 minimum, because they had a waiting list. That's the perfect example of bad management. However, I noted a good point, the young hostess was nice, and she offered us bruschettas while waiting.
Another thing I didn't like, was when I went to the bathroom I noticed that the hand soap was mixed with water.
On the other hand, the waiter was polite and messy, we had to repeat several times our orders, which he even messed up, same for the bills.
Food was less than average, tomato mussels were salty, portobello portions were too small.
Finally the peanut butter chocolate cake was good."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this out based on the reviews and the fact that a friend had recommended it. However, I would never come back. The menu was extremely confusing and had a number of dishes. However, once served, a lot of the food tasted the same. The escargots were overcooked, chewy and rubbery. The actual meal that I did have, lobster raviolis, was covered and baked in an inch think of cheese. The veal medagalioni was questionable. I don;t even know if it was fully cooked because the pasta was so think. It was greasy and not appetizing at all! I was thoroughly disappointed. I would not come here unless you want to leave feeling disgusting and paying for something that is a guaranteed stomach ache!"}
{"text":"Beaucoup de choix le midi du hamburger aux pâtes en passant par la pizza. Incluant une soupe ou une salade.
La salade césar était bien mais la salade d' avocat servi comme il y a 30 ans farci de crevettes de Matane et de chair de Crabe contenait quelques crevettes pas fraîches qui gouttaient l' ammoniaque. Ensuite arriva ma pizza qui n' a que le nom. garnitures fraîches mais fromage pas assez fondu. Mais le pire fur de voir que la pâte a pizza n' est même pas fraîche mais bien une toute achetée comme 
dans le rayon de la boulangerie a l' épicerie. le genre de croûte qu' on achète prés emballée avec un sachet de sauce. Inacceptable et honteux pour un restaurant que se dit italien. Le service était sans reproche et le décor est bien."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant avec un menu Italien varié contenant des plats traditionnels qui sont souvent délaissés par les restaurants type chaine. Le service est excellent. Les portions sont grandes. Pain chaud avec trempette balsamique en arrivant. Beaucoup de recettes avec sauces à base crème. Grand salle, stationnement facile. Les prix ne sont pas excessifs."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been there for three times. The portions are too huge! I share one pasta with my mom and we cannot even finish it. Be aware."}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service inside a beautifully designed location.
Large menu, and all of it is authentic.
I had the chicken Parma and although it had a bit too much cheese, it was delicious.
Decent wine list. I enjoyed the house red wine. It was smooth.
Portions are huge, so be ready to mangia!!!!
Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in Montreal.

Reservation at 7.30, sat down at 7.55. Managed to order at 8.15...

I've waited longer for good food but this wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Lots of different choices for pasta! Pasta was a great portion, tasted very good. Bread at the beginning was nice, but don't fill up on it so that you can enjoy the pasta.

Very good service."}
{"text":"I took a look at the crowd and decided it would be faster for me to order take-out rather than sit for a long meal.  The menu is extensive, though the pasta selection surprised me - it seemed like everything was a cream-based sauce.  Well, I was in heaven, since I love cream pastas and adore pesto.  

My order was ready 10min after I ordered, which is suspiciously fast.  I was also handed a loaf of bread to go (a very pleasant surprise!).
The pasta was good, not exceptional, but quite good.  the ribbon pasta feels homemade, the chicken is not dry, the sauce is thick but not heavy.

I will come again soon."}
{"text":"Very nice experience here. The waiter brings you a nice baguette and cuts it in front of you. They season it if you wish. The pasta is made fresh and the wine selection is quite good. The restaurant itself has a very nice atmosphere, as if you're in Italy. The portion are quite decent. You will not go home hungry. The staff and also very courteous."}
{"text":"I know this place is very popular with people in the west island but every time I go to this restaurant for some kind of special occasion, scheduled by people from the neighbourhood. The food both meat and pasta taste like they came from a can or at least reheated after being made in an industrial kitchen. I fear this restaurant is a waste of time the only good thing about it is the parking. Do your selves a favour and stay away."}
{"text":"The places looks gorgeous inside and out and there's plenty of room for having a large gathering but...it's just pasta. Don't get me wrong, they serve other stuff but pasta is the main selling point. The pasta is good, the sauce is good and the bread is good...that's it! Just good. The place is also so packed and hectic that you probably won't be able to tell your server what you want without a megaphone."}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere with a friendly staff. The pasta is good but is more of the comfort food variety - nothing fancy. I ordered the ricotta stuffed cannelloni which tasted fine but I thought the sauce was too watery. Overall you get what you pay for, and maybe a bit less."}
{"text":"This place looks like they hired some of the best decorators in town. The atmosphere feels really joyful and relaxing at the same time. The pasta was also quite good. The service was good but could have been better. The disappointment is that when I ordered my carrot cake, small bits of parchment paper was still stuck on it."}
{"text":"Still
Nothing has been changed here, everytime we go here food is getting worse and worse it has no quality sauces for pastas are too wateryand full of salt   , soup is full of salt    Everything is bad here , please stop calling yourself a Italian restaurant you guys are disgrace . After all you get what you pay  for ,  for example 2 appetizers ,  2 order of different so called pasta 3 coke  1 small salad with taxes in $ 62 Loooool  please just think  about it how can they give you a real authentic good quality Italian food  for this price? Plus you look at the clientele who goes there you'll know what Iam talking about. This is A Mc Donald's  of Italian restaurants instead of eating  2 Big Macs 2 fries 2,poutine  2 drinks and 2 apple pie you come to this so called low quality Italian restaurant and pay maybe 10% more and make yourself happy by saying I ate at Italian restaurant:)  But yesssssss they give you free hot  cheap quality bread and if you ask some more they will bring another one for freeeee yeeeyyyy  :))))) now you guys get it why people goes there? Plus like I said on my previous review all the menus are dirty  and unreadable when you touch the menus they are all greasy yeakssssss. Ok before I forget stay away from the lasagna  it's made with shitty quality procesed cheese swimming in shitty quality ready made ( frozen ) meat sauce. Me and my family  will never ever come here again ."}
{"text":"Good food and very good prices. HUGE portions no way you can eat an appetizer, meal, bread and desert. If you could just eat your whole main course I'd be surprised. 

Anyways food is very good for the price and the service is very good as well."}
{"text":"My favourite Italian restaurant!
Best service
Best parmesan
Best warm bread
Best prices!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a very nice restaurant with lovely Italian decor. It's beautifully designed but also makes you feel homey with its warm colors.

FOOD: The pastas are all delicious but heavy. You can tell that all of their sauces are all homemade. I also really enjoy their rack of lamb although their sauce does contain a lot of pepper so if you're not a fan of pepper, you might not like the dish as much. The meat is tender and has a nice flavor to it. And their fried calamari is delicious! Overall, every time I come here; I am usually very happy with my meal.

PRICE: It's decently priced if you compare it to similar restaurants. Although I do find some pastas to be overpriced, they do offer a table d'hotes menu which includes an appetizer and is usually a little less expensive.

SERVICE: The service is always great. They make sure that you always have freshly cut up bread on the table and are always attentive."}
{"text":"Favourite pasta place where you get your money worth this was a takeout order of linguini pescatore"}
{"text":"I went to Scarolies for a relative's birthday party this weekend. The cheeky interior design and the large, comfortable seating made for the perfect space to host a family event. However, the service was subpar and the food was meh at best.

I ordered a kale, mango, asparagus and chicken salad from the list of weekly specials and asked if it was possible to replace the chicken with zucchini, as I am vegetarian. The waiter said that would be no problem. However, when my salad was brought out, it was literally just a pile of romaine lettuce with a handful of grilled zucchini on top... When I finally tracked down the waiter, he tried to tell me that I read the menu wrong and that the salad of the day was actually a seafood salad. The menu clearly said \"Insalata di Pollo Chipotle\". I remember explicitly because I had taken a photo of the menu before ordering. When I told this to the waiter, his response was, \"Yes, pollo. A seafood salad.\" What??? Even if it was a seafood salad, it had said it was a kale base with almonds, mango and asparagus and the salad he brought me had no toppings whatsoever.

The waiter offered to go get the menu so I could see *my* mistake. However, when he came back from the kitchen he admitted that he was the one in the wrong and brought me a side plate with mango and asparagus that I could slide onto my bed of romaine lettuce. Overall, a very disappointing experience, food wise."}
{"text":"To start off, yay for fresh baguettes! This place is delicious! Ive gone a few times and have really enjoyed my meal. Last time I got the angel hair pasta with seafood. Delicious. A bit heavy, but got to have it for lunch the next day"}
{"text":"Italien standard qui recours généralement à des ingrédients du commerce possiblement congelés (pâte à pizza) pour préparer ses plats tous aussi classiques les uns que les autres. Portions abondantes, vaste salle, parfait pour les groupes d'après boulot.

Correct quand même, mais n'amenez pas de clients là. Ils méritent mieux."}
{"text":"I love their bread and the little thing they do with the basalmic and olive oil for dipping the bread.  Seriously, I'm pretty sure I stuff myself with the bread everytime.  It's so good.
It does get crowded especially for dinner.  Overall the italian food is pretty good.  I like their gnocchi.  I haven't really had any bad food here and it's one of those places we like to go when we are in town because of the atmosphere.  And yes, the bread lol.
It's not like the bread is like super duper amazing, but fresh bread is just delicious.  Plus they take it out of the sleeve in front of you which makes for nice fresh presentation."}
