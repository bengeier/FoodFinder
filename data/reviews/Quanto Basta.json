{"text":"I have been going to Quanto for quite a while now and thoroughly enjoy the food, service, and drink selection. However, I went quite recently and found they have a new chef, and now the restaurant has new take on all the \"old\" favourite recipes.. the fish and hen have been basically cut half the size (one can only assume to maximize profits).. and seriously lack flavour. Additionally, the side vegetables have gone seriously downhill.  At any rate, the service is always great... but this most recent experience has been very disappointing for the quality of food related to the price.. we will likely not return for awhile."}
{"text":"My first experience at this little hidden gem was this past weekend.  Being a long weekend, a friend had suggested we have dinner here, and from the very beginning to the end, exceptional.  The manager on duty as well as the service staff were happy and smiling and really took the time to explain the wine list and dinner menu.  I was truly awed by the entire visit and will be back!  HAVE THE PAPPARDELLE!  DELISH!"}
{"text":"I came here for the prix fixe lunch and I can say that I'm not impressed. Their prix fixe lunch comes with two options for appetizer, main, and dessert. All in all, not at all impressed with the food. The complementary bread basket with the hummus was quite tasty but this was probably the best part of the meal. The gnocchi was mushy and in the Arabbiata that tasted like canned tomato sauce. The presentation was not at all appealing and I felt like I was eating a pasta dish you'd expect to find on an airplane. The creme brulee was soggy, didn't have the crisp top, and overly sweet. Service was also extremely lacking as no one came to check up on our lunch and we had to flag down another server to get our bill because our original server was no where to be seen."}
{"text":"Nice decor with quaint bar you can enjoy your meal at. Happy hour deals are a nice touch. Friendly service. However, this week I requested the risotto special sans veal and was charged full price for my dish even without the meat.  $32 for average risotto with peas & mushrooms. Really? Very disappointing indeed. And lesson learned."}
{"text":"Totally not impressed - and was really looking forward to enjoying dinner here.  We started with a lobster bisque and the calamari fritti.  Both my husband and I love bisque - but this tasted almost burnt and really over-salted.  And very very fishy.  I love lobster and seafood, but this just tasted wrong.  The calamari honestly looked like something you would get at a crappy chain like TGIFridays or similar.  It didn't taste or look like fresh calamari but something you would get from a frozen package.  I did enjoy my mushroom ravioli - although they could tone down the cream just a bit.    The ambiance is really lovely, the service was nice and it was packed - so I thought it would for sure be a great experience.    Not worth the $$"}
{"text":"Was tentative about going here after hearing mixed reviews from a friend but it seems that Quanto Basta has really gotten their restaurant together!  Excellent wine, food and service.  Try the hen if still on the menu. The pear and bacon crostini is an excellent starter.  I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"We went there around 9pm on Friday night. The setting is nice and elegant. We sat at the bar and ordered a glass of bubbly, which was ok. They have a nice wine selection and they are friendly and quit generous with their tasting, in that they let you try many of their wines free of chrge before ordering them. My Husband ordered their special which was a beef tenderloin pasta. I have to say the food was underwhelming. The pasta was too thick and the so called tenderloin was tasteless and drowned in a see of sauce. We also ordered espresso and their flour-less chocolate cake with a scopp of hazelnut gelato and that was really disappointing. The Gelato scoop was filled with bits of ice, the kind that forms in ice cream and gelato when they have been left in the back of the freezer for months, and didn't really have much taste to it. The flourless chocolate cake was so over cooked that it was dry and tasted almost burnt. The staff however (including the manager/owner who was there) didn't seem to be bothered by that terrible dessert. I asked, and they confirmed they make the desserts in house."}
{"text":"Excellent choices in design.  I came here for brunch. Not too busy, was perfect for finishing some work in a quiet corner in the back.  Service was friendly and knowledgeable.  However, the food is overpriced.  I got the 'Salmone' dish.  The smoked salmon and hollandaise were very good, but the hasbrowns as the bed of the dish needed some work. They were not soft, still hard. Definitely needed to be cooked more, or a switch in the choice of potatoes they are using. I was expecting the potatoes to be a smashed potato hash, or something a bit softer. I did enjoy the complimentary banana bread and my cappuccino was creamy and done correctly. I could have overlooked the price, but the food made me feel rather ill..."}
{"text":"One of my fav place. Kale salads with sprinkle of pin nut, add stake, they cut it up and display nicely. Like daily soup too. Good environment. Very cozy."}
{"text":"Forever my favorite place - good wine - amazing eats.   If you haven't tried Quanto Basta, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Food: 6.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Service: 8.5/10 Overall experience: 7/10  Came here with a large group this past weekend. The layout of the restaurant is very narrow - think hallway expanded, so if you're looking to host a mighty fine birthday blast here, don't expect to get the conversations a-flowing. You are bound to create some \"tumors\" (people on the ends) with the table layouts.   It is your typical $15 a drink place. The service is definitely better than average, but it does not make up for the just okay food. I won't go so far as to say they are not making an effort, but it would seem that their attempts at great Italian food falls short; the food lacks flavour, finesse and all that jazz.   (FYI - I ordered the funghi salad \"insalata funghi\", and short rib pasta \"orecchiette costatine\" if you want to try something different)  THE BOTTOM LINE: Service is good, but if you're looking for great food, look somewhere else."}
{"text":"meh. Went for my graduation dinner here.   The owner is very friendly. She tries too hard.  Beautiful decoration. Great location.   Is this a trending problem with many new restaurants in Toronto?. Because they re gorgeous but that is it. Is like eating cheap catering food in a museum.  The food hit and miss.  Gazpacho soup: Was that really a gazpacho? To me it was badly chopped onion and pepper floating in toms clamato. Disgusting. Real gazpacho is not even comparable to this. I lived in Spain several years and can speak freely about this.  Truffle app: Very well executed, excellent flavour!  Burrata salad: Nice, nothing I could have not prepared at home.  Fish stuffed with fennel: Good, althought the filling was not that good, needs some more garlic and seasoning in the supposed marinade. The only good part of this dish was the potatoes and the carrots.  Pasta: fantastic, fresh, sauce fresh.  I would recommend the owner to be more attentive with the menu, the cooks and prep boys are not really hitting the note.  Very expensive for the quality offered."}
{"text":"Pros: -Nice ambience; music, lighting, seats  Cons: -Poor service; slow, not knowlegable, aloof -Bland Dishes -Expensive  I do not recommend getting the squid ink pasta.. not true to the dish, just black coloured noodles."}
{"text":"Just went once,  but i really liked this place. The food was really delicious and carefully prepared. I had carpaccio and the wild mushroom ravioli. They also have great options of wine by the glass. The decor is really nice and the service was excellent - very attentive and efficient. I am just not giving it five stars because it is a bit pricy for what they offer. But i would definitely go back, specially if I need to take someone to a place that causes a good impression but is not too uptight."}
{"text":"Great pasta, and a very good wine menu. The place is cool too :-)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our experience! Superb service, food and ambiance. The branzio was delicious."}
{"text":"My friend has been raving about this place for the past 6 months and since it taunts me everyday on my walk home, I finally made the commitment and went for dinner at Quanto Basta.  Nestled on the Rosedale strip, Quanto Basta is a great addition to the delicious Italian fair already offered in the area. They are opened for lunch but bustling during dinner. The bar is always packed with attractive business men, couples and locals conversing over bottles of wine. The owners of the popular, successful Italian restaurant Capoccacia are behind Quanto Basta. (Sidenote: Capoccacia has amazing pizzas.)  Service: The staff were very attentive and friendly. Our waitress was very knowledgeable  but she seemed a bit impatient and indifferent to us. This bothered me at times but I liked that she wasn't pushy or trying to up sell us.  Wine: They have a nice wine list and actually a good list by the glass. I had a light bodied wine which I enjoyed (forgotten the name). I hate when restaurants only offer 4 reds/whites by the glass and they are house/generic versions. Although I love a bottle of wine my head and wallet can't always afford it.   Food: Can you say specials! The waitress must have listed about 10 different specials for the evening, which means the Chef is loving what he's doing and imagining creative new spins on Italian eats.  The bread: It tasted day old, but they had a special beet spread that not only tasted heavenly but also looked like it would do wonders for my skin. Main: I ordered the ravioli zita e basta (wild mushroom ravioli in a cream truffle sauce). A fragrant, sleep inducing flavorful concoction. I usually can't finish a ravioli cream dish but I didn't have any problems.  the garnishing of chives and a enoki mushrooms added a cooling balance to the cream.  We only spent 1.5 at the restaurant and I wasn't incredibly hungry to get a full three course experience. I always prefer to spend 2-3 hours to get the full picture.  I'm sure I'll find myself occupying one of their tables soon to get a full Quanta Basta experience \"as much as you want/like\""}
{"text":"Quanto basta is Italian for \"how much is enough.\" The answer is - once is more than enough.  Our waitress was having a bad day. The food was solid, but the cloud that she brought to our table overshadowed any food that was served. It was clear she was having some sort of dispute with the other waitress, who was crying behind the bar. Definitely the best way to spend my cash on a Friday night in a sleepy area of Rosedale."}
{"text":"I pretty much agree with everything that's been said about QB. I enjoyed my view of the front kitchen, getting glimpses of the chef doing our pasta, since the option of meat was no longer available at that time (not that I was interested).    Our bread basket was an assortment of delicious, though I would have loved some decanted olive oil on the side. The dish, gnocchi with lobster was creamy and very well seasoned. The staff was very cordial, and it felt like the place was pretty much closed for the night. When I return, I'll make sure it's a lunchtime visit."}
{"text":"We booked through Yelp/Open Table, and had a pretty good meal, and left a nice tip, but then discovered that \"our reservation had been canceled\" according to Yelp/Table. A call to the restaurant did not help - while the maitre d'ess recalled our arrival ( and ticked us off on her iPad) when called by telephone, she had no idea how to correct the error. Emails to Yelp/Open Table came back unanswered. According to them \"we get too much spam to respond\", so 1/2 hour to 45 minutes was wasted trying to get this corrected.  My advice: avoid this place until they come into the 20th Century.  If you are starving and need a place to eat, call by dial telephone, or leave tablets of stone. Maybe THAT they can handle."}
{"text":"1 word to describe experience. 'Perfection'. The service, chef, food and ambience was exceptional. Great 1st date spot!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is small, warm and cozy with a front of the house staff that was friendly and inviting. It is a small restaurant and quickly became a bit noisy once seated.  Started dinner with a glass of prosecco which was quite nice. This was followed by insalata di baccalá, a pugliese style salt cod with potatoes, onions & olives. I had been looking forward to this dish - the cod, potatoes and overall seasoning were near perfect. But then the dish was completely ruined by a preponderance of rather strong red onion, which managed to stay with me the balance of the meal in to the next day.   I then followed with the special offered, an oxtail ragout with gnocchi. The dish looked beautifully prepared and the oxtail was extremely tender and the gnocchi perfectly cooked. There ended any chance of enjoyment.  The dish was laced with red pepper making it hotter than some extreme Thai cuisine. I enjoy a bit of heat and can hold my ground with the best of them, but after about four fork-fulls, the meal became inedible.   When our waiter finally dropped by for his courtesy visit, for what in general was a slow service, his comment to me was simply \"sorry to hear that my friend\" and then quickly vanished once again. There was no offer to correct the situation or to see if something else was preferred. An almost full plate was returned to the kitchen, with no further comments as well.  By the time I got home, I found myself running for the tums and soon after the restroom. This morning, with the residue of onion still prevalent on my palette, I felt compelled to warn others to avoid this dining experience."}
{"text":"Definitely a neighbourhood favourite.  Great value in the charcuterie for two.  They have a nice wine list, you can't go wrong with their fresh pasta and the bruschetta special is always fun to try."}
{"text":"The food here is always good. I like the Sunday night meatballs special. The bruschetta is different every day and always tasty . The serving is enough for two (or more). Wine list is especially good with some excellent Italian choices. Service is friendly. A bit pricey but I think worth it. Occasionally a local celeb or two."}
{"text":"I you are looking for a delicious Italian meal this is the place to go! A great selection of appetizers and dishes to choose from and on point service. I will be bringing friends back here in the near future!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant, with delicious & fresh food. My go to is the gnocchi arragosta & their antics romana salad. Absolutely delightful!!"}
{"text":"Went here for VDAY and loved the atmosphere.  Very cute place.  I had a special VDAY cocktail which had no price listed but I figured it'd be 8 or 9 dollars.  To my surprise it was $15 which was a bit ridiculous IMO.  As for food I had the wild mushroom ravioli and it was AMAZING.  The most tastiest pasta dish I've had in awhile.  Usually ravioli from Italian places consist of 5 pieces of ravioli but this plate had more than that which was great haha.  The warm flour-less chocolate cake for dessert was great as well, not as amazing as Terroni's but still delish!    Great spot for a date :)"}
{"text":"Monday 8:30 pm near Rosedale.... Dark and Rainy and Hungry!  Nothing seems to be open... We just want food after our yoga UYE at Roots... One of the regulars at the yoga studio suggested Quanto Basta...  So nice to have Quanto Basta taking us in right before closing. The space is nice has this rustic Northern Italian vibe.  Gnocchi all'aragosta  (lobster & crab in a truffle, prosecco & cream emulsion) $22 tasted so delish! I never into creamy sauce, but this might pasta might change everything... lobster tail...real crab meat with those soft and chewy gnocchi. Oh maybe that truffle does the magic?!  I would have ate the whole thing by myself... I can... but it might be just too fattening but well worth all the calories!   Our waiter is nice and attentive.   I want to go back to Quanto Basta just to have that Gnocchi!"}
{"text":"Came here with two girlfriends for dinner.  With the first bite of my appetizer I was blown away! It was absolutely delicious and decadent. Our mains came out in a timely manner and it was also extremely amazing.   Not only was the food good but the service there was extraordinary! The customer service was exceptional. Once we walked in the door we were greeted by two people, and we got sat immediately. Our server was very informative and helped us pair the perfect wine for our food. She was was attentive and made excellent suggestions! I wish I knew her name because this girl deserves a raise!   I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  We had a table of 7 and everyone was happy with their meal.  I had the tagliatelle bolognese that was very tasty.  My girlfriend had a truly incredible pork chop that was not part of the regular menu but was the days special.  Funghi salad was flavourful but tough and overcooked.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant at least 5 times and each time it has been delicious.  The most recent time was last night when I went there with four friends.   My friends had the grilled calamari appetizer that they loved and it looked really wonderful.   I had the soup of the day, a sweet potato soup and although it was okay it was nothing special.   Two of us ordered the brick pressed cornish hens that were absolutely delicious including the sides that came with.  It was a huge portion so we were unable to finish it.  Our friends ordered the grilled branzino which I tasted and it was excellent as well.  In the past I have also had their kale pasta which was so good. Great fresh food made using quality ingredients.   I plan to go back again soon."}
