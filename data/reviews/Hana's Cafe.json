{"text":"hmm.. don't know about the chicken! I looked up reviews on yelp and went to Hana's today. I ordered the chicken pita and my husband got the gyro. The gyro was good but the chicken pita was far from tasty. The chicken was dry and did not have any flavor - forget anything close to greek. 

Otherwise, it's a small, cute and cozy place. If only the chicken was good :( I love gyros with lamb but most of these places mix lamb and beef in the gyro which grosses me out. Also this place did not have hummus on the menu. Me and my sweetie enjoy hummus, so I guess this place is a no-go for us.

Can anyone suggest a greek restaurant(s) that serves lamb gyros?"}
{"text":"I've been there twice and both times I was surprised at how good it was.  The first time I had the falafel sandwich and it was fried perfectly crisp on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside.  The second time I had the gyro platter, which is a mound of shaved gyro meat, pita wedges, jasmine rice and a Greek salad.  It was all great, right down to the Tzatziki You might balk at $9 but it's a huge meal, definitely worth it.  I also suggest the flavored iced teas that they have.  Really, it was all amazing.  You could pick this place up and put it in any city and it would fit right in."}
{"text":"I eat at Hana's probably two or three times a week.  I absolutely love their chicken meal.  Its grilled chicken, rice, pita, and a small salad for about 9 dollars.  I also love their grilled chicken sandwhich.  It's more of a philly sandwhich type thing but sooo good. You will not be dissapointed.

P.S. I just scarfed the Hana's Mixed Greens salad.  Even though there wasn't really a mixture of greens really,  it was soooo good. Almonds, parmasean, marinated kabob chicken, onion, tomato, cucumber, and lots of cabbage. Yum."}
