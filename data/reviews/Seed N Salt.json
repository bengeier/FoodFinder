{"text":"We just stopped in for latte and we both commented on how delicious they were. Probably the best soy latte I've ever had. Super creamy and smooth."}
{"text":"So delicious! Great interior and amazing food. Would be a 5/5 except for the portion sizes are REALLY SMALL. I've been here 4 or 5 times and ordered bowls every time. They are all delicious, but small. They only fill up half the container they come in, which makes them appear even smaller. I'm a small eater, but after eating here I still need to supplement my lunch. 
Great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Their soups and salads and other offerings are certainly nutritious, but the portions are on the small size for the price, and they just don't make one sit up and say, wow. And so it's more or less the same, high on price and another victim of sophisticated marketing in the relatively high-nose district of 4th Street. 
Want to combine flavour and nutrition in a really good way?
Go a few door down the street on the corner with 21 Avenue, and order a Blaze Pizza with all the fresh and nutritious toppings that come together just the way you like it, and if you want some salad, add some arugula, spinach, squash and zucchini to your 'make your own' favourite pizza, or order a choice of 4 different salads that will rival Seed and Salt for most of us.
Seed and salt?
Just not enough to return for. Perhaps it's a restaurant wherein to be seen and visit and know that the marginal-flavoured food you are consuming is good for you. For me, not enough."}
{"text":"Deliciously addictive....Decided to drop in here for a late lunch and had the hulk smoothie and Tangled Thai bowl with spicy tofu. WOW!  Turned out to be a good choice, the spicy peanut sauce had just the right kick and it was a super filling meal. A great new restaurant on the 4th street scene in Calgary. Just wish this restaurant would open in Vancouver so I could try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Located on 4th street, I've honestly driven by this place at least 100 times and never noticed it. I only decided to stop by when I heard about the place through some people I knew and I finally saw the sign. 

The place is quite cute with lots of tables and chairs. Went at lunch and though there was a line, there were still plenty of seats. 

The set up of the counter looked a little confusing to me; they have a line for just drinks, but it's also the line you pay at after you order your food at the far left counter. Maybe need better signage? Not sure. 

The staff working there were really friendly though and took the time to explain the menu to us and make some recommendations for us. 

I decided on the tangled thai and added the citrus shrimp. The bowl was as good as it sounded, but I was disappointed in the 4 pieces of shrimp I got for $4. I would recommend getting a different protein!

We also got the Spartan which had a lot of flavour and was good as well. We chose chicken for this bowl and we got way more chicken vs the shrimp in my thai bowl. 

Overall the food was tasty and made well - the only complaint I have is maybe the cost and portion as it seems to be a bit on the expensive side for the amount of food you get. I felt like I could have probably ate another half a bowl...

I also tried the Hulk smoothie which was good and tasted really tropical. I would avoid if you don't like coconut as the taste is really strong. I wanted to try the other smoothies but unfortunately most have bananas and/or dairy in it and they said they couldn't make substitutes. 

Overall would recommend this place if you are looking for a healthy alternative!"}
{"text":"I am so happy about this place opening up near me!! The inside is beautiful and airy with cute little plants on the tables. You order at the front, fast food style and they call your name when it's ready. It was very quick when i was there. I tried the \"Glory\" Bowl with faro, brown rice, spinach, shredded carrots and beets, almonds and pomegranate seeds. It had a tahini dressing that was delicious and pulled the whole thing together. The sweetness from the pomegranate seeds was a nice touch. It was the perfect amount for me and left me feeling satisfied and happy! My boyfriend tried the \"urban cowboy\" salad which had pulled pork in it and a bbq lime dressing it was delicious too. I can't wait to try more of their items when I want something quick, healthy, and tasty."}
{"text":"The girls wanted to get something light and fresh after our yoga in the park session. They settled on Seed N Salt so we headed over on a holiday Monday for a late lunch. We dropped in around 1:15pm. The place was bustling with a steady line of hungry people. Lots of room to sit outside on their patio! It's right next door to Shokunin. 

The inside is slick with lots of inspirational/motivational messages of health and community. Goes with the relaxed vibe. You order at the back of the room and work your way down the line to pay. You can see the workers making everything fresh.

Everything here is healthy. They've got salads, bowls, seasonal, seedlings (for kids), custom (make your own bowl), smoothie bowls (acai!) and smoothies. There's also coffee and wine if you're feeling boozy.

The owner came over and chatted with us for a few minutes. Apparently, they have access to a back room  where they might be able to host a yoga and salad night. I'm sure people/hipsters would be all over that.

- Mojito smoothie ($7.50) - this was under their seasonal selection. They split our drink so that we could share. Quite minty and very reminiscent of a mojito, just in a much healthier format.
- 2x Tangled Thai ($10.50) - my sister added citrus shrimp ($4.00). Just the slightest amount of heat but everything worked well together to create a balanced, tasty bowl.
- 2x Urban cowboy ($14.00) - another seasonal selection.
- Farmhouse cobb ($10.50)

Not necessarily a place I would pick myself but it's a quick, healthy spot and I would come back to try their acai bowls!"}
{"text":"A great healthy choice! Another rice bowl/salad concept. Pick your base and fill your toppings or choose one of their options on the menu. Had take out for work and it was filling for all of us girls.

A suggestion I would make is to have a separate pickup & pay section so it doesn't feel like I'm budging the line for those ordering or topping their bowls."}
{"text":"Oh my yes. I went there opening day and got a Glory Bowl (see what they did there?) and added falafel as protein. The bowl doesn't look all that impressive- it's spinach, farro, brown rice, shredded carrot and beet, pea shoots and almonds with a somewhat thin-looking \"glory dressing\" that's tahini based. I got the falafel (3 balls of memory serves) as a protein because I expected it'd go well with the tahini dressing. I was skeptical, until I tasted it- GLORY-ous. Absolutely delicious and the brown rice soaks up that dressing so perfectly. It was pure delectable-ness from start to finish; everything goes with everything perfectly. I want to try more menu items but it'll be tough not to get this bowl next time.

They have a good, serious coffee program here- a La Marzocco Linea and beans from Fratello. Much more than one expects to find at a fast-serve place like this but they clearly have a thing for quality here."}
{"text":"I know that salad/bowl/smoothie/avocado toast establishments are on every other block now, but I was SO impressed by Seed N Salt. A coworker took me here on a work trip and this will be one of my staples every time I come to Calgary. The ingredients themselves are simple but the combinations are quite interesting and delicious. 

The bowls and salads are excellent lunch or dinner choices. They're very balanced - nutritious yet filling. I got the Tangled Thai and added shrimp, and there was just enough brown rice in there to fill me up while still focusing on the vegetables in the dish. I recommend getting the dressing on the side; while the spicy peanut dressing is delicious (with a little bit of a spicy kick!), the dish has a lot of flavor by itself. 

I couldn't resist getting a slice of the avocado banana bread for dessert on my way out, which I demolished before my Uber even showed up. The avocado gave the dessert a richness that left me feeling satiated rather than over-sugared.

Honestly, I wanted to order EVERYTHING on the menu, and I'm sure I'll make it through all the items at some point. Next time, I'll be trying the breakfast items! Their breakfast and smoothie bowls look like the perfect post-workout treat!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Tangled Thai bowl with roasted chicken here a few days ago for lunch and it was absolutely delicious! It's nice to see more places offering healthier options pop up around town. The atmosphere was great, and the open concept of the restaurant was very inviting. I had made it for the lunch time rush, so service was a bit slow even with the large amount of workers they had. Regardless, staff was very friendly and I'll definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Came here once for a smoothie and it was pretty good. Would have rated it four stars on that visit. However when I went today I walked up to the counter, three employees were working and no one offered to take my order. I stood waiting while one looked to be cleaning one of the machines and two others were having a conversation with eachother. On more than one occasion I made eye contact with the two employees conversing with eachother but neither stepped forward to take my order. No one even said anything like \"hi we'll be right with you. I waited for five minutes and then turned and walked out. Is it considered bad service if no one gives you any service? Can't say I'll be racing back anytime soon. Management might want to look at their service standards."}
