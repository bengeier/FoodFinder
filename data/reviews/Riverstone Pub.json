{"text":"Good atmosphere nice place inside ordered the burger it was charcoiled and wouldnt feed it to my dog good for a few drinks i suppose"}
{"text":"Cheese lovers unite!! Saturday nights Riverstone has a cheese fondue that will melt you heart. Staff were really friendly and they had a great local band, the Narda Roberts band- rocked the place! Highly recommend visiting here! If you're not there for music you can play pool or darts or just sit by the fire"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Riverstone Pub on a ~monthly basis for the last year, and the food has always been really good (especially the soup!).  I have yet to order something that was bad (although the nachos were a bit of a disappointment, but not bad), and you can't beat the $7.25 steak sandwich special.  The beer selection is extensive, although it's not particularly exciting.  They carry all the big brands of beer, plus some local brews.  The atmosphere is... unique. The layout is a bit strange, with a separate room with pool tables, a tiny stage beside the bar, and washrooms hidden away in the back.  It is rather dark inside, but not enough to make it hard to read the menus.  The stone wall/fireplace accents and home-made hardwood floor tables are a little tacky, but for a local pub, it fits.   The service has always been good or at least adequate (I never expect stellar service in Calgary), and they have a consistent group of servers - not newbies that don't know the menu.  The bands (Fridays and Saturdays) are decent, and play a mixture of new music and older rock.   Go on a Friday, you won't regret it (if you can get a table - but if not, be patient, and one will open up)!"}
{"text":"We went after receiving a coupon in the mail for 10% off and were surprised. It's not a big place and there's something wrong with the layout, but they have generous portions of food. My girlfriend ordered the taco salad and I had the steak sandwich. The steak was terrific and cooked the way I ordered it. The taco salad was enough to feed four. The sight of it was hilarious. \"I don't think that's near enough for her,\" I told the server. He laughed. \"Well,\" he said, \"we can always bring out a free refill.\" Good people and pretty decent food. My girlfriend carried the leftovers out in a medium-sized pizza box."}
{"text":"The Atmosphere was excellent! The band was awesome and got the group going.  We also enjoyed how they let a random patron play guitar and sing a few sets after the band was done.  It was a ton of fun! Friendly people and a good neighborhood pub with lots of TV's, pool tables, VLT's and seating was a plenty.  I highly recommend their pizza it was delicious!  The service was excellent and the waitresses were friendly.   The only complaint, it's so dark in there we couldn't read the menu."}
{"text":"As pubs go, this is a pretty decent place. I have only been there a few times, but always enjoyed myself when I did. The few times I did go, I went for a birthday, so we didnt really have to deal with finding a spot to sit.  Service was PERFECT. If only I could remember the waitress name we had cause she made the night. I couldnt believe she remembered around 20 peoples name (just at my table) the whole night and didnt mess up our bills at all.  I will say this, my friend had his bill messed up and he told the waitress and she was very appreciative that he did (since it would of came out of her pocket) She was so pleased that she bought him a shot. That just goes to show that if your a good customer, the waitress will be just as nice.  Food was decent for a pub. Definetly get what you pay for. I got fries and gravey and wasnt able to finish it, wven with people helping me. And for $5.75, you really cant beat that price."}
{"text":"I went to the Riverstone for the first time tonight and wished I'd been sooner. My waitress (Nicole) was excellent and helped me navigate the menu for my specific diet (vegan), making sure even the bun on their veggie burger was egg free. Most folks might not need to worry about that, but her efforts meant a lot, showing that this place goes out of their way to accommodate their customers. If you're a wing person, even the vegan will say get on over there! Great menu! All in all I had excellent (and fun!) service and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I'll be back for more fun and food very soon."}
{"text":"Just had brunch here service was amazing and the breakfast poutine was fantastic!! Would highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Great pub tucked away in a strip mall...so very Calgary!  Fairly large room with a stage and some VLT's.  We had the burger special and they were homeade and totally delish, fries were also perfect.  Service was attentive although I was charged for a pop refill without being warned.  Once again I was the DD and everyone else was having a beer so I think it's a little chintzy to do that, but I would return for the food!"}
{"text":"NOT WORTH YOUR TIME... go down the road to a better pub!  A few of our friends raved about this place, so we all went up there for a Birthday dinner.  Upon arrival, the first thing we noticed was there was no lighting... ok, so they were going for a cozy ambiance, but they missed the mark.  We ended up looking at the promising menus via cell phone flashlights.  The menu had a good selection, so we decided to place some orders.  For our appetizers, we ordered two orders of nachos, as we saw that they were very tantalizing, and were a large serving, so why not... Well they were presented to us, and we were very disappointed.  They were both over cooked, and one of them was missing the extra meat that was ordered.  After 20 minutes of letting our server know that the one order was wrong, the server brought out the meat, which was presented as a side dish, and it was overly greasy, so we were unable to enjoy it.  On to the main course... great... a Lamb Brie Burger and a Mushroom Swiss Burger... what could go wrong... these sounded amazing!  SO WRONG! The Lamb Brie Burger was served with a full wedge of brie on the patty, not a nice few slices to allow the cheese to melt over the cheese, so this made it incredibly hard to eat properly.  The lamb patty was over cooked, to the point of dry, which made the burger unenjoyable.  The Mushroom Swiss Burger was overcooked and saturated in mayo... there is a fine line of the perfect amount of mayo and too much, and they missed the line by a mile.  It was soo saturated; we ended up not eating it.  Both burgers were served with fries... awesome, a saving grace... NOT!! They were over cooked, greasy and served to us cold.  This was the last straw... we promptly paid our bills, leaving and never looking back at this pub."}
{"text":"you would never expect it from the outside, but this is a great little place. the food is excellent and made fresh from high-quality ingredients. it's also very reasonable-priced, i couldn't believe they were serving such good food at these prices. probably the best pub grub i've had in calgary."}
{"text":"Visited with 3 people after a session at the University. Quite close.  The Fine sixty9 menu - 35 cent wings were what we wanted as a snack.  Liked the salt and pepper the best. Even though we ordered how many more sweet/spicy wings. who doesn't like wings as a snack? Maybe even a meal?  Ordered some drinks - the place wants you to order drinks to accompany the wings.  Playing pool is kind of fun - it's unlimited.really nice atmosphere! Really like how there's a nice Den or well-organized basement feel to it."}
{"text":"Not sure why I have tried this place more than once. Service is pretty bad....unfriendly and slow. I could overlook it if the food was good and/or reasonably priced but it is neither. Plenty of other places are better than this."}
{"text":"We stopped in to the Riverstone to have a drink and take a look at a menu as we waited for a friend to get off work in the area. Our experience for this night was a 1 star but this was due to the 4 drunk, yelling, harassing patrons that were in the bar, at a table, being over-served and having a whipped cream food fight. Ridiculous. It was obvious that the waitresses were not happy with them and this leaked over into their service. I felt bad for the older patrons in the bar who were trying to talk, eat with their families/friends and hear themselves think. Just when I thought management would have had the balls to throw these clowns out, they were served another pint, what a gong show. Looking past that for a moment, the bar was dim, lots of TVs, a good sized place and clean. The menu was varied and there was a steak sandwich on for $6.95 for Fridays which lent to the fact that the place was very busy as it was dinnertime. There were a lot of these coming out and they looked good! Comes with your choice of fries or soup of the day. The drink specials were decent too, 4 flavoured vodka mixed drinks for $5.25. NO debit at this location. Cash and credit card only. It was hard to leave a nice tip but we did even though if took forever to get drinks, the bill. My husband wanted a steak sandwich so bad but we were not willing to stay 1 second longer than needed. I understand what a pub can be like - we practically lived in them in University but I have never in my life seen grown men act like such fools in a public place and not get tossed. A sad experience and not sure we would come back if this is the clientele that the Riverstone attracts. Shame on the management for not acting more responsibly."}
{"text":"Slow and unfriendly service. (Except for one blonde waitress) I was leaving nearby the pub and a friend of mine and I went to the pub as it was really close. Overall I have been there for three times until now and always seated myself outside. Everytime the servers saw us walking in and recognised that we headed outside. It took at least 15 minutes for them to come out to bring us a menu although the pub really wasnt buisy at all. The order for drinks could ne placed right as we got the menus but usually we didnt directly know what we wanted so we had to wait for the waitresses coming again for at least 15 minutes. The last time I went I had to wait over 25mins after I was asked what I wanted to eat but at this point I already decided against ordering food anymore. Usually once you ordered food it got to your table pretty fast and was enjoyable therefore the kitchen seems to know what they are doing. I came back to this place just because it was really close and a coke was affordable next to good internet. Overall the menu is decent but the prices arent the best. I you want to go for a fast drink go somewhere else or seat yourself at the bar. I hope this was helpful!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was terrible. I went with workmates to watch the World Cup at noon, there weren't a lot of people and there was a lone lady server who was a bit rude. I asked a question and she barely acknowledged me while walking away. She also took ages to give our bill. The only thing I liked here is it wasn't crowded and noisy but I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu I've tried is much better than the usual pub fare. But this review is for the Saturday special: Fondue in particular. We've tried many of the special fondues around the city: Wurst, Midtown, etc but this one takes the cake! Look at the picture! There's a huge portion of steak, grilled asparagus, purple mini potatoes and they even go so far as to toast the slices of baguette! The portion of cheese is also large enough for everything to be liberally dipped. Seriously, you gotta try this fondue!"}
{"text":"I can't complain about anything at the Riverstone Pub.  I've never had a bad experience there.  Every time I go to this place it's never for more than a couple of beers and an appetizer or two.  They have a pretty normal selection of pub meals and appetizers, but it's usually pretty good.  I've had to send my wings back before, but that's because I ordered hot and received salt and pepper... that's not quite the same.  It totally wasn't a big deal for me or them, and they took them back right away.  The people are generally nice and friendly... maybe because everyone's a local, or because it's just good people.  The servers are usually pretty laid back and casual with us, which I like.  Riverstone is somewhat hidden in a little strip mall on Northmount Drive but once discovered is a pretty sweet find.  I really like the atmosphere in the place and always enjoy my experiences."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised to see a couple of four-star reviews here. It appears, even though there aren't a bunch of reviews to say for sure, that this place used to be pretty good, but has suffered since.  As I drove home, I was worried that I wouldn't have one positive thing to say about this pub. However, as I sat down to type this review, it occurred to me the Diet Coke I was served was cold and was a good mix. So, there, the one positive thing.  I get it. It's a neighborhood pub. Very casual. Lots of regulars. However, our experience today would have made a great 'What not to do' video to show at waiter/restaurant school.  Slow service, no follow up. I ordered a clubhouse, because my usual thinking is 'Can't screw up a clubhouse'. However, there is one certain way to do that: leave it under the heat lamps for more than five minutes. That turns the top slice into a shingle, and does nothing to keep the fillings warm. I disassembled the sandwich and ate the filling with a knife and fork. The fries were fine, the gravy good. But cold.  Why didn't I send it back? We did not see the server again for at least 30 minutes (and that is not an exaggeration). I suspect she went on a break, but that's not a reason.  Long waits, cold food, and a less-than-spotless floor and general area. And top it off with a $40 bill for some really crappy food.  Some advice to management: Close that back section when you have less staff on. The sheer volume of floor-space your crew had to cover severely hampered their times.  I can't find fault with the attitude of the wait staff. While their speed was certainly lacking, they were pleasant enough.  Maybe it's different on a Saturday night. But should the time of day you go decide what kind of service and food you get?"}
{"text":"The food is always great!! The drinks are always good too, service is a hit and miss. I would have gave 5 stars back when me and the hubby where regulars. We always play billiards after we eat but the more we went the harder it got to get table people always reserving them and our favorite waitress Kim left so eventually we left. I heard she was back so maybe we will give it another chance in the future!"}
{"text":"I am in the middle, I have been here twice, the first was pleasant, celebrating a soccer victory with my team, the second was annoying.  Hence my stuck-in-the-middle review.  The second time I was meeting a friend for an after dinner drink. I meet her at the pub, she has ordered a water. She then proceeds to tell me she just threw up. uhhhhhhhh The hockey game was on, and my friend had chosen a wobbly table under a TV, I was flashed at by the images, while the pub was very dark. Maybe to accommodate for the sport viewing? The first time I was here, I remember it being better lit, I could go as far as saying it was bright. The waitress came over fairly quick after I sat down, and I ordered a beer. It was fairly pricey for a bar that is not situated anywhere near a walking mecca, $6.75 was my Steamwhistle.  Unfortunately for our poor waitress, my friend insisted to drink the single glass of water the whole time and I had driven, so a second pint was out of the question. Also we didn't order food.  I did eat here my first visit, and I remember it being surprisingly good. The only detail I can remember is I had a side salad and the raspberry dressing they made in house was awesome!  So my ear was complained at by my friend, I drank my beer and the waitress was constantly checking to make sure we were okay. I felt bad, so I decided I would tip her a little more on this solo beer bill. I thought $8 was fair, so i handed her a ten and asked for $2 back. She fumbled in her apron and placed what I thought was a twoonie on the table and walked off. Perhaps it was how dim this place was or she was really pissed my friend only drank water, but a loonie lay on the table. I had no way to prove now that she had short changed me. I drank the dregs of my now $9 Steamwhistle, donned my coat and said good by to the large white stone interior complete with horse print right next to the washrooms.  Maybe next time Riverstone, maybe next time."}
