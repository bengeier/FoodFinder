{"text":"Traditional dining hall food. It's operated by Aramark which operates all the dining halls on campus. Food often lacks flavor and variety. Great gelato. But food is definitely mass produced and not impressive."}
{"text":"Fucking bomb dorm food. They have some fairly decent pizza. Gelato is on point. Burgers that put manzy's to shame."}
{"text":"Really like this place! Honestly all the applications and essay writing to get into Barrett feel totally worth it just because of the food. It took about a week to get the desire for pizza out of my system, but since then, the place has been really encouraging for me to eat healthy (much to my surprise)! I think I might experience a negative \"freshman fifteen.\" Also, the staff there are really nice, which is also a huge plus."}
{"text":"This place is amazing especially if you're feeling up for a buffet. They serve certain foods during the week, but they always have burgers and fries on hand. The chicken noodle soup is out of this world! They even got a machine that serves almond milk."}
{"text":"Ah, Barrett. You are the dining hall to end all dining halls. The dorm food to end all dorm foods. The conspicuously placed piano to confound all conspicuously placed pianos. When I am gone, this place shall live on forever, an homage to a culinary past that few could dream of. Forks up."}
