{"text":"Disclaimer: this is not a place you go for the ambience, unless you are specifically seeking out hole-in-the-wall-ish dumpling spots (which quite frankly, to me, is a good sign that a dumpling spot is actually worth going to).  This being said, the dumplings (especially when fried) are outstanding! Personal favorites are the lamb ones, but all the pork and beef varieties are quite good as well....trust me I've tried most of them.  They are hand made in-house daily by the very friendly staff and sell them frozen too if you're a dumpling fiend like me and need your late night fix after hours.  If you're down for run of the mil Chinese food, there is some good value from some of the combos and they are ok, but as the name of the resto suggests, dumplings are the star here - order accordingly.  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"J'adore les dumplings. J'adore le fait qu'il y a un resto de dumplings dans le Sud-Ouest. Je me suis fait livrer à quelques reprises des dumplings et j'ai été très satisfaits... prix, qualité, quantité : super! Récemment, je me suis rendu sur place et j'ai été déçu de voir la propreté générale de l'établissement. Beaucoup de potentiel mais il y a énormément de travail à faire sur le propreté de la cuisine (que l'on peut apercevoir du comptoir) et l'état général des lieux!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting and dirty, especially the washroom and the kitchen, and I ordered a dumpling without eating a single one after having watched  its kitchen condition. And the cooker uses her hand to grab the food without wearing a glove and then touch the cash ."}
{"text":"$4.99 including taxes for 3 choices of Chinese food with a hot and sour soup plus rice is my kind of deal. They also have a 4 and 5 choice option.   I selected diced chicken with potatoes, sweet sliced onion and scrambled eggs, and my third a garlic tasting green bean looking veggie \"suan tai or garlic sprouts\" with small pork nuggets.  All of this was served to me pleasantly and with a smile.  The soup was warm but all else was lukewarm to cool, yet still very tasty on a very cold day.  The newly painted lime green walls warm up the simple dining space. Tables are topped with baskets filled with light soy sauce, chili flakes and \"chinkiang\" (dumpling) vinegar. Add a fork, spoon and one paper-thin napkin (I guess for a five dollar, meal I can use my sleeve).    Restaurant de Wang ji is pretty no frills, but somehow it's meant to be that way.   Next time I'd like to try their dumplings and other dishes.  Please note: Watch for some bone shards in the meat."}
