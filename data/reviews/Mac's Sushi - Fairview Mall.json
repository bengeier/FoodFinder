{"text":"End of the day sale for when you really crave sushi and need a quick bite at the mall is okay"}
{"text":"It was a rainy Thursday afternoon when I walked into Fairview mall looking to purchase a sweater for my grandmother. Unfortunately the one I had planned to get her was all sold out so I left the store feeling sad and defeated.. on my way out of the entrance I noticed this bright red sign that read \"Mac sushi\". My stomach grumbled. I decided to take a look at their copious assortment of fresh sushi, and man was I in for a pleasant surprise. I asked the man working there if he could possibly make me a specific type of roll that they didn't have displayed and with no hesitation he complied. Within minutes (maybe 1.5) my delicious personalized sushi roll was ready for me to devour. And devour I did. Amazing/Iconic/delicious/etc. Mac sushi you rocked my world. Highly recommend :) thanks again!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this mall a lot. The sushi here is consistently tasty. The quality of the salmon is very good. My favourites are the salmon avocado california rolls. I would recommend buying sushi from here during the end of the day sale because it can be quite pricy during other hours."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations in the first place for this location. I bought a bunch of rolls and it was probably one of the most flavourless rolls I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"This one is sectioned off and has four stools to sit. They had more variety than the one at stc. However I still went and got the crunchy veggie rolls. They had a smaller portion of the rolls which I liked. The staff isn't very friendly but whatever I just wanted to get in and out. It was very fresh and delicious. Will probably come back to this location or stc this week for some more!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi take-out. I usually visit during end of day sale which is after 5, but still fresh. The small ones with 6 pieces are 2 for 7$, not bad for ppl who can't eat a lot"}
{"text":"End of Day specials here are cheaper than the Scarborough Town Center location 2 for $7.00. Sushi rolls here are pretty good!"}
{"text":"Of the fast food sushi chains, this one and Sushi Q are consistently decent (I abhor Bento Nouveau, as the sushi is VILE!!!)

Selection includes maki, nigiri and seaweed salad.  They start their End of Day sale fairly early in the evening, with very reasonable prices.

There is a counter with 4 seats, otherwise food court seating is on the lower level, at the other end of the mall.

Based on 4+ visits."}
{"text":"I always go for the vegetarian or california rolls here.  Seaweed salad is good but it leaves a weird after taste for me. The service is quick, you just pick up ad pay.  They do have a special at the end of the day which I usually take advantage of if I am there anyways.  I would not say they are the best sushi place I have been to but they taste and quality is perfectly find for my palate.  I rarely have to wait in line to get my sushi which is an added plus.  It does get busy at lunch or dinner.   But the line up is nominal."}
{"text":"I usually only get food from here when it's after 5pm and the END OF DAY SALE is on.

My favourite tray has the 6 pieces of mix sushi, 4 pieces of Cali maki and spicy salmon, seaweed salad and shrimp sushi and it's only $10.  My fave!

Not bad at all for being in the mall."}
{"text":"The quality of sushi here is really good. I also don't usually eat ginger at sushi restaurants but the ginger here is phenomenal. It would be best to go to the end of the day sale because it's a bit expensive at normal price. I believe the end of the day sale begins at 4pm or 5pm. One thing to note is that they do not take credit, only debit or cash."}
