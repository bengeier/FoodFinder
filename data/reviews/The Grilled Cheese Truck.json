{"text":"My favorite food truck of all time. I'm having them cater my wedding."}
{"text":"These guys are legit. Had them at my boyfriend's surprise birthday party at the house. Was so awesome. Food was delicious and the guys were there early for setup which was perfect!"}
{"text":"I think what I got was called the cheddar melt... it was a grilled cheese sandwich with extra-interesting spiciness. Almost a little overwhelming on the seasoning for me, but I'm generally not used to any seasoning at all in my grilled cheese sandwiches. Might need to tone down the seasoning just a tad.  Picked tater tots as the side, and they were good. Not too salty."}
{"text":"There is only a smidge of cheese on the grilled cheese from this truck. It looked like one thin slice. That is not likely what anyone expects from a truck that has \"cheese\" in the name. The other ingredients that we paid extra to get put on the sandwich were also bland and sparse. Maybe this is how kids like their grilled cheese? But we make grilled cheese at home often enough to know how easy it is to make a flavorful, worthwhile one. The one we got from this truck was not that."}
{"text":"OK worked the Great AZ Beer Festival, had a pepperbelly sandwich, with chili, freto's and habenero cheese, it was the bomb. They do corporate events and charity events also, all the cooks and servers are funny and really know their stuff.  Cheese is an american favorite food, these guys know their cheese..."}
{"text":"Meh. It's just a grilled cheese sandwich. Nothing else. I can make the exact same thing at home and not pay $8 for it. Like someone else said, this is just a fad."}
{"text":"Nice service. Fast & fresh.  Would've given 5 stars if my drink were in a cup with ice vs. a can of soda.  Delish French bread w/ my 3 cheese melt!!"}
{"text":"Got to finally try the grilled cheese truck. Been dreaming about since the first time I saw it about a year or so ago. Fresh avacado, friendly service, saved the bacon for my dog. She loved it too. Get the whoopie!!"}
{"text":"I visited The Grilled Cheese Truck on my lunch break on August 11th to sample a few of their offerings.  My order consisted of a Mac and Cheese Melt and French Onion Melt, both with the Tots.  Service: The cashier I interacted with was very pleasant and helpful. She seemed very positive and upbeat which was a pleasure to see. The cook, who handed me my food, also seemed very upbeat and friendly. I can however say that the length of time to fulfill my order was quite long. It was approximately 20 minutes for my order to be filled and handed to me. If I was in a time crunch this could have been disastrous. I must make note of the fact that there were only approximately 3 people awaiting their orders in line with myself at this point.  Food: I was extremely let down by the offerings here. The Tots were the highlight of the food but nothing to write home about. They were your standard tater-tots that could be deep fried.  Both of my sandwiches were very dry and squished beyond recognition. When I read the menu for the French Onion Melt, I was excited to see it being offered on French bread. I suspect my sandwich was not done on French bread, but it was hard to tell as it was squished together that badly. The only distinguishable taste on this sandwich was the onion which was far too crunchy to have been cooked for any decent length of time. The dryness could have been remedied with the broth that was supposed to be included but was never given to me.  The Mac and Cheese Melt also was not up to scratch. The mac and cheese had a very bland flavor and was dry above all. I fully expected something light and cheesy but this did not deliver. The bread used primarily is your standard white bread which I took exception with. When one is paying between 7-8 dollars per grilled cheese (without any sides included in this price) I would expect that something like Texas Toast, which offers a bit more size, would be used. I would even expect the sandwiches to use more cheese, as I felt they were quite stingy on that with only the middle portion of the sandwich having good cheese coverage.  Talking to my colleagues, they too felt the same way about the food. Fairly bland, flavorless, lack of cheese, squished, and far too pricey.  Bottom line: Far overpriced for what you receive. If prices were essentially cut in half it would approach an acceptable pricing scheme, but as is, you are better off elsewhere. Either prices need to come down or quality needs to skyrocket for The Grilled Cheese Truck to be a must try."}
{"text":"Mixed experience here. The tomato soup tasted like and had the consistency of spaghetti sauce. It may be fine for dipping but not for sipping. On the other hand, the French onion soup grilled cheese sandwich was phenomenal. The end result?  The sandwich met and exceeded expectations for something called The Grilled Cheese Truck so that outweighs the awful soup - 3 stars."}
{"text":"The sandwich I got, the Turkey Bacon melt, was extremely mediocre. I could've made that sandwich at home for half of the price and it would've looked and tasted the exact same. That is disappointing because I was extremely excited about it. On top of the letdown that was that sandwich, me and two other co-workers of mine that ordered the same thing all feel ill after eating it. I will NEVER be stopping by this truck again if I ever stumble upon it in the future."}
{"text":"Got the Mac n Rib. For $8 it was really really average. I expected it to have a larger amount of macaroni and cheese on it. They forgot my order, and it took 20 minutes to get my food. It was good but it didn't really seem worth it."}
{"text":"YUMMMM I got the one with pulled pork and Caramelized onions and it was delicious! It could be a tad faster tho..."}
{"text":"I will not give them more or less stars because to be honest anytime you have a food truck you don't expect much.  The pricing on these grill cheeses seemed high and I never struggle with paying more but you ask me to pay, I ask for good food.  Lets just say the different selections I ordered didn't sell me.  I was hoping for a great tasting grill cheese and instead I self reflected with nostalgia from my grade school lunch tray..  The tots tasted like they came from a Safeway and the cheese on my sandwich seemed to be picked up at the next aisle.  I appreciate the attempt."}
{"text":"This truck is awesome. They make probably the most genius sandwich known to man, the grilled cheese with Mac n cheese AND ribs on it. Absolutely incredible. If they had a location I'd be there all the time!"}
{"text":"What a mess of an experience. Decided to try them at the Scottsdale Arts Show. They had a healthy line going, so I gathered bad things I'd heard must have been fixed.  Nope.  I'll give it as a list. People were getting their sandwich an hour after getting in line. We waited a half hour for ours after ordering, but not sure how long we were in line before that. A half hour for a grilled cheese sandwich... at a food truck? Ridiculous. They could have told people about the wait or done other things to help, but nope. People ended up comparing the time stamp on their receipts to try and figure out which order things were coming out in and when they might get their food.  So we got the food... and my wife's order was wrong. I had a special order, which they got right, but she ordered one of their standard options and they messed it up. We debated complaining but, what, wait another half hour to fix it?  The sandwiches were okay at best. They came out nice and hot, but just not that exciting. Certainly not worth the wait and hassle on a food truck that doesn't seem to have their act together.  \"Grilled cheese\" is a comfort food that people love, so I think that's where they're getting a lot of their draw when they show up. Pass them by and hit a different one of the great food trucks if you have an option. I've never seen a place put so much discomfort in comfort food."}
{"text":"I bought the cheese and rib sandwich.  It was bad. They put an ounce of ground pork on one corner. It was terrible."}
{"text":"I'm torn between one and two stars. I've heard RAVE reviews for this food truck and was excited to try it. What came out was a sad disappointment. I got the ham and cheese, dad & little sis got the turkey bacon cheese. And each one was $8, with no sides which is pretty expensive for just a sandwich but we were willing to pay for what we thought we were getting.  I expected thick sliced french bread, a decent portion of meat, and some quality cheese. What we got was wonder bread sandwiches with cheap precut deli meat (the kind you buy prepackaged) and a cheese that was vaguely reminiscent of kraft singles. I could've made them at home for less than what one cost and tasted just as good. I'd have to agree with the guy who says this truck does not live up to the standard of \"gourmet food truck.\""}
{"text":"Ripoff city. No creativity with bread or layers of cheese, etc. This place has become corporate. Go look at their website and they are selling franchised trucks to roam the country. They lost the quality, but it was my first time eating at this truck. Caught up to these guys at the Cravan in Scottsdale with five other trucks. I had the $5.50 three cheese melt and added marmalade onions for a buck. It was just like I make at home and I should have opted for that decision. Normal slices of wheat bread, small amounts of cheese and the blue cheese was not even melted properly. Take some time, rethink the product your serving and make it better than it should be. I think this truck is too far gone now to return to having unique food."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them more stars but the wait time is not worth the food. It tasted good but we waited over 30 minutes for our food. Everything about their process is terrible. They only made one order at a time. The guy taking orders was not slowing down to wait for the food to be delivered so there was about 20 people in front of us waiting for their food. The beverages were in coolers next to the order table and you grabbed one yourself. They were out of water and only had a couple cans of Diet Pepsi cold. He added more cans to the cooler but they were warm. All in all decent good with the worst service."}
{"text":"I love the GCT and their story! Prices are a little high, but they've combined my two favorite foods. Mac&Cheese on a Grilled Cheese? YES PLEASE!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out at the Estrella mountain event on July 3rd. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed especially after paying $8 with tax! I had the goat cheese melt the bread tasted old. I love goat cheese but whatever was in the sandwich was just bland. After my first bite the half I was eating completely fell apart."}
{"text":"The namesake item, grilled cheese, was really disappointing but the tomato soup was pretty good. When it's $10 for a grilled cheese, I'm expecting thick bread with a nice crust on the outside and soft on the inside filled with plentiful ooey gooey cheese. Well this grilled cheese was none of that - very thin bread with a measly single slice of cheese half melted. It was so disappointing. The tomato soup was surprisingly good, sort of thick and chunky like a pasta sauce while still being soup."}
{"text":"Ehhh, pass on this one, Highly disappointing! I had read their menu on line (so that I wouldn't have to figure out what I wanted while standing in line) but was told the menu is wrong and they don't have those items any longer. That should have been the first clue. Horrible! Portions were ridiculously small but since the taste was pretty nonexistent I didn't miss much. Absurd amount of money for worse than mediocre food!"}
{"text":"If you like grilled you will like this place! Only 2 kinds of bread but several cheeses to choose from & tons of topping options! I had pepper jack cheese with avocado & it was great!   What appeals so much here to me is that everyone in each group can get a different product. It would be too much for me to buy 2 different loaves of bread, 3 different blocks of cheese & all the toppings. I don't  keep all this fatty food at home but it's nice to be able to get it here sometimes.  The price isn't cheap but not over the top- $8-$9 for a sandwich, tots & drink.   They do have dessert options too that i haven't tried but look interesting- Like a smores sandwich!  I liked it & will be back. I gave 4 of 5 stars because there is only can soda (no fountain), it's a bit of a wait, & it's so unhealthy!"}
{"text":"A friend has actually rented this truck out for his birthday.  Fun idea, but grilled cheese?  That's a pretty simple dish, right?  Ah, but have you had pulled pork, cheese, and macaroni on a grilled cheese sandwich (a.k.a. the Cheesy Mac & Rib)?  Now that I have, I'll never look at the humble grilled cheese the same way again.  The buffalo chicken grilled cheese sandwich is equally worthy of praise, mixing in equal parts savory and spicy.  I also got an order of their s'more melt for dessert.  A mix of marshmallows, graham cracker, and Nutella.  This one was a little bit disappointing.  It tasted pretty good, but was much lighter than I expected and I think it could've used more Nutella.  Still, all in all a good meal with great unique twists on their menu to choose from.  A food truck definitely worth a try if you can track them down"}
{"text":"Worst grilled geese I ever had.  I could slap two pieces of wonder bread together with a piece of muenster cheese and it would blow this trucks sandwich away.  I got the turkey bacon grilled cheese.  Hardly any bacon, a slice of cheese, slice of processed turkey and two pieces of white bread. It came with tater tots all for the insane price of $9.50.  It looked liked they smashed it in a George Forman grill.  I would of been completely embarrassed to serve this food.  Avoid this truck.  What topped it off for me was the payment screen on the iPad asked how much of a tip I wanted to leave...WHAT?!?  You have even started making my food and you already want a tip!!!!! I tip on service, the better the service the better the tip."}
{"text":"We tried the American with tomato. It was very underwhelming and the bread was overlooked. We would give that one a 1-2 star.   We also tried the one with chili, green chillies and tortillas in it. It was spicier than we expected but not bad. Again the bread was overdone.   We also thought  the bread wasn't anything special. My husband says 4 if it wasn't overdone. I say 2, husband says 3. I'll be nice and give a 3."}
{"text":"Some friends and I checked it out at sleepy dog and its delish! Tried the goat cheese, porkbelly, and apple pie grilled cheeses plus the tomato soup. All had distinct flavors and were yummy! Definitely worth tracking down!"}
{"text":"The idea of a grilled cheese sandwich is a thought of immediate deliciousness. Gooey cheese on toasted bread. Yes please. Can't go wrong there.  We came to this truck in a parking lot street fair while vacationing in Scottsdale. Sadly, we were disappointed. We ordered the brie and green apple sandwich and a regular grilled cheese sandwich with sharp cheddar and tater tots. Everything was underwhelming. Both sandwiches could be made better at home. The tater tots may as well have been the frozen kind. The sandwiches didn't even seem that hot. Brie is one of my favorite types of cheeses and I found this sandwich mediocre -- the green apples didn't add much. I paid almost $15 for all this and a bottle of water. Food costs were probably $3 and I have the skill (I'm the worst cook!) to make these things better at home.  Food trucks may be a '10s fad. This food was barely up to par but it was at a street fair and the guys all had matching shirts and it was a bright painted colorful truck with a menu and social media logos on the side.  I'm going to recommend passing on this truck. It can keep on driving."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but for the first time trying out this food truck I was not impressed. I was so excited to try a \"gourmet grilled cheese\" but It was far from that.  They were okay, but not for the price."}
{"text":"Sad to give only 1 star.  I would have given them 5 stars after last years experience at the original truck.  They ran out of the plain bread and could only make the sandwiches out of wheat.  We ordered 2 sandwiches and paid a total of $26.78.  My sandwich was supposed to be grilled with Frito's inside (.75 cents extra), there should have been more than 6 soggy chips in there.  VERY disappointed with that.  I probably should have just gotten a plain grilled cheese. For $26.78, we could have purchased about 6 loaves of bread and some fine cheeses and made a MUCH better sandwich at home.  I won't be going back and I hope they lose some stars here.  I also 'Unliked' them on Facebook. OUCH It seems they may have a new fleet of smaller trucks which attend events and serve across the valley, however, it's just not the same experience anymore."}
{"text":"$17 for two sandwiches that were on par with what my grandma made me as a kid?  Those were free and they came with a kiss.  The concept has potential but there was a huge gap between the price tag and the resulting small sandwich.  Maybe I should have had the fortitude to wait in the line for the Lobster Lady."}
{"text":"I have seen this truck around Los Angeles and after catching up with one in Scottsdale I found out that they have 3 in L.A. and 2 in Phoenix area.    I got the \"fully loaded\" which is sharp cheddar, macaroni and cheese, pulled pork, caramelized onions.  The combo version of this comes with your choice of tomato soup or tater tots and a drink.  The sandwich itself was great and has enough on it to fill you up but at $11.75 for the combo I was not happy with the soup.  It was really chunky almost like chile, I think it would be much better paired with the grilled cheese if it was more like a bisque.  I will try it again next time I happen to see one of these trucks but without the soup."}
{"text":"The Wife and I were to run errands after I gave Blood on Saturday, and as we were going to be on that side of town anyway, we drove out to the Gilbert Farmer's Market to grab some grub from the trucks that were gathered.  Thus I discovered the Grilled Cheese Truck.  At first glance at the eclectic menu of melty goodness, I saw the prices and pondered whether $7 was just a bit too much for a Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  After careful consideration, and spying what looked like the tastiest thing on the truck, I figured I'd find out.  My Choice: The Pepperbelly Melt.  Composed of habanero jack cheese with homemade chili, cilantro lime sour cream, fire-roasted tomato salsa and crunchy Fritos, I was certainly going to find out.  The homemade chili itself makes it a formidable sandwich, but the habanero jack cheese ups the ante.  I added Bacon because that's how I roll.  It was relatively well balanced, with the chili just slightly edging the the other flavors to the background, to he point that I could just barely make out the cilantro sour cream.  I must have let the sandwich sit too long (less than a minute) because my Fritos were either not present, or soggy.  I would order it again, just to make sure this one wasn't a fluke.  The Tots that are available as a side a re a good complement, but not as much as tomato soup would be.  And, the Grilled Cheese Truck knows you don't fix what's broken ,offering Tomato Soup by the shot or cup.  I think, perhaps $7 is a bit much, but I'm willing to reserve final judgement until I visit them again and see if the Pepperbelly truly blows me away.  They are all over, and in many states, but check their website: http://www.thegrilledcheesetruck.com/, then get down there and give them a try.  They post their calendar for their cities there."}
{"text":"I've visited this truck twice now. The first time was at the Agritopia farmer's market. I had initially gone there to eat at the waffle truck, but when I saw this quaint little truck, I decided to give it a go. It was not a disappointment, rather... I had ordered the goat cheese melt to share with my husband, and after eating my half... I demanded another!! The tomato soup is less soup and more marinara sauce, which is odd, but I'm not gonna lie, dipping my sandwich into it made it THAT MUCH BETTER!!! So, I sent my sweet husband over to order another one for the road!   The second time I ate here was at the farmer's market in Power Ranch, the only reason I went was for this damn delicious sandwich! I ordered it the exact same way, goat cheese sandwich with the tomato soup on the side. I was sooo disappointed, sitting in the grass under a beautiful shaded tree, my sandwich was not what it was the first time I had it. None the less, I did finish it because my husband would have given me a swift kick in the butt since we had driven just for this sandwich.  It may have been a different cook, or maybe they left something out, but it was absolutely not the same Umami sandwich I had during our fist encounter. I will give this place another try, and then post another review! Good luck to you Grilled Cheese Truck, may you live up to what you once were!!"}
{"text":"Dude! of all the food trucks I have tasted, of all the grilled cheese sandwiches I have had, they are doing it well! The tots were the bomb! I had the roast beef with horseradish and tomatoes and other stuff, it was amazing!"}
{"text":"One of this food truck's regular stops, on Tuesdays at the Anchor Centre office complex in the Biltmore district, was notified by the California HQ Administrator this morning that the Phoenix  truck franchise has ceased operations. This can probably be confirmed here http://thegrilledcheesetruck.com/"}
{"text":"I was all excited but it was very average. Over priced for what you get. They use typical small size bread like what you'd use at home, and it does not hold up well or get a nice crunch. They could do a lot better w/ quality \"deli\" sized bread which they could grill longer/slower for that all important crunch you expect w/ a grilled cheese sand. The flavor is not bad but they missed the boat."}
{"text":"Only thing we had was a customized dessert melt with roasted banana puree, graham crackers and marshmallow since we wanted to try out several trucks but it was to die for delicious. They had a ton of menu options so we can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"This... Was an interesting forced upon find... Like... They found me. Literally.  I was minding my own business at work when an email came through from the big bosses that this food truck would be in the parking lot. Apparently they'd demanded their presence. And then every employee in my call center, including my boss, began chattering all excitedly like Gollum to his precious about the noms to be found inside this obnoxious colored food truck,.  I was intrigued.  I was even more intrigued and skeptical when I learned this was a truck that only served grilled cheese.  And then I learned more... Like... They're not your average cheese and soggy bread sammiches!  I ordered, at my boss' behest, the Cheesey Mac N' Rib with BBQ pork and tots.  This should be illegal. It's to die for, and their bacon mayo:? Equally heinous and just... wrong. Food truck food should NOT taste this good. Ever. My skepticism was shattered.  Only complaint? It took 20 minutes for my order to be up. My break is an hour long... That was precious facebook time wasted so I'll remove a star, but other than that? Holy God. Please come back!"}
{"text":"First off I have the write that the crew and staff of this truck were amazing!  Friendly, professional, and engaging.  Unfortunately, that is where it ended.  With all the hype, my expectations were pretty high, however I am sad to write that this was the worst grilled cheese sandwich I have ever tasted.  And the price was criminal!  $9 for a grilled cheese with bacon on white bread?  Really?  I have seen better sandwiches at my kids school cafeteria.  Honestly, I could have taken the $9, bought a loaf of good bread, a pound of bacon, real butter, and a block of cheddar and created a half a dozen sandwiches that tasted better!  I'm sorry guys, maybe you had an off day, but this was a horrible culinary failure.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"YUM! I love anything grilled cheese and this place did not disappoint. I was able to check out this truck at the Streets Food Festival. I got there early and luckily the line for this truck was not too bad. When we were leaving, the line was crazy. There is a reason though. The grilled cheese was delicious. I got to try a brie and green apple grilled cheese. Oh I still dream of this concoction. It was just crispy enough and had so much delicious cheese. I just wish it was bigger or that i ordered too. My husband had a grilled cheese with fritos, spicy cheese, pork and he was amazed. He does not get excited by food, but he got excited by this. We loved it. Follow them on facebook. They are franchising their trucks, and keeping a truck in Phoenix now. I will definitely be going again. It is also owned and ran by veterans- so I felt even better giving them my money."}
{"text":"This if for their driving not food.  You cut off a bunch of people as you ran a stop light! Glad i was further back... Im sure it wasnt that important for you to do that."}
{"text":"Disapointing after a 20 minute wait. I had the \"Fully Loaded\" and the Smores. Neither was worth the wait. I was hoping the sandwich would bring home good family mories, which it did. It made me miss my mom's cooking which was much better."}
{"text":"The food was good, I tried the mac and rib, but for 8 bucks I expected more. Basically it was a grilled cheese sandwich with about 2 to 3 ounces of pulled pork in the middle. The menu makes it sound like it's a french roll with piles of pork and cheese. I expected something similar to a cheese steak.  For 8 bucks I would not try again but glad I gave it a shot."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different so I went to the grilled cheese truck.  I got the Sweet Sriracha Chicken Melt. Total w tax $8.20.  Honestly, it was dry and nothing special. A bit pricey for a grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Too bad I can't give it zero stars for unprofessional business practices. Our company reserved the food truck a month in advance. We found out the night before they weren't coming. We only found out because we called to confirm the reservation. They were just not going to show up! Sorry I can't tell you about the food cuz I didn't get to try it and I never will! Thanks for nothing Grilled Cheese Truck"}
{"text":"I really had to argue with myself whether to give this place 3 or 4 starts.  Food truck Wednesday consists of a handful of trucks going to a car dealership off Raintree and Hayden in Scottsdale. Most people in my office have heard of some that go there but didn't know about these guys.  A few months ago when they opened this location, they came into our office and told me that they would be around and I have wanted to try them ever since.  Fast forward to today when I have a pregnant woman in the office and me having a fat attack, we decide its the perfect day to go for a visit.   We had searched their menu online and had a good idea of what to order before we got there. Their special today was chicken and fried waffles grilled cheese with gravy sauce for dipping. It looked good but I didn't see anyone else order it and I already had my mind made up.   My friend ordered the Mac and Cheese grilled cheese with a side of tots and their bloody mary ketchup. I ordered the Mac and Cheese grilled cheese with tomato soup side. The sandwich was good with sharp cheddar. I have never had pasta in my sandwich before so it was a little weird eating as the pasta would sometimes slip out - but it was good! The bloody mary ketcup was good, it tasted more like a cocktail sauce but it was nice and spicy and refreshing the way the drink is too. Tots are tots are tots -deep fried nuggets of potato and I love them.  The soup was where I had more of an issue. I didn't have an issue with the flavor. It had great tomato flavor with the yummy licorice of basil mixed in however it wasn't a soup....it was closer to a thick marinara sauce that you would eat on pizza or with mozzarella sticks or something more to that nature. Now don't judge me too hard but this is how I would do it if I were them:  Create something called Grilled Cheese Dippers where you cut the sandwich in strips rather than triangles, thus making dipping easier. Use the great soup/sauce as the dip and you have yourself a great meal. Create a velvety creamy tomato soup for the actual soup part and then give people the option of what they want.   I literally had to spoon the \"soup\" onto my sandwich to make it would because eating this \"soup\" was as if I opened a jar of pizza sauce and heated it up.   I will go back here. I know they have great flavors and I even saw a special for a caprese grilled cheese. And their regular menu items seem like they are awesome as well. I can't wait to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Sometimes good, sometimes not.  Tater tots are plentiful.  That much is appreciated.  They just got my order wrong and I ended up paying over $10 for something I didn't want and didn't eat.  Take a chance if you're feeling lucky.  The food isn't too bad."}
{"text":"I love this truck. I have had it 3 times now. It has come down in Tempe to World of Beer and now is coming to my work. Expect about $10 for a sandwich, 1/2 order of tots, drink, and ketchup. Two of the times I have had the buffalo chicken with blue cheese. The other was the mac and cheese with rib (fully loaded). Both are excellent. The tots are great, especially with the bloody mary ketchup dipping sauce. I definitely recommend this one!"}
{"text":"They came to my neighborhood and started giving away free food and I haven't been happier. I got the Mac melt it's a grilled cheese with Mac and cheese in it with tater tots. It was delicious also the guy taking our order was super rad!"}
{"text":"Our family loves Grill Cheese sandwiches and I make them at home all the time with some awesome ingredients.  I checked the calender and found out they would be close to us so we went.  I was a little disappointed.  The bread was just plain bread nothing fancy like rolls or croissants, they did not have ice cream shakes like i heard they had from a friend.  My friend ordered the three cheese with bacon which was a whopping $7.75 really for a sandwich...I ordered a specially designed three cheese with brie, American and the fancy swiss since they only had Goat's cheese with tomatoes.. My sandwich the cheese was not melted all the way so it was crunchy and they were both very very salty, they should use unsalted butter.  I was not impressed, over priced sandwiches, nothing unique, very boring.  I will not be back.  I make them better at home using different breads and ingredients.   This was the Scottsdale AZ truck.  They staff were really nice.  One of the cooks used to cook for the Navy and was stationed on submarines. cool - the highlight was talking to him not the food."}
{"text":"We were coming off the Daisey Mountain exit in Anthem where we live and saw one of these trucks . Sure looked interesting hope to see it open for business in our area soon time."}
{"text":"Tried this at the Scottsdale Food Truck Caravan - a grilled cheese lover's dream! Pure artery clogging goodness.   My friend and I split two of the sandwiches, one was the Cheesey Mac and Rib - definitely our favorite of the two. It was full of mac n cheese, sharp chedder, bbq pork, and caramelized onions. I can't remember the other one we tried - it was good, but didn't even compare to the Cheesey Mac and Rib."}
{"text":"It's awkward reviewing this because I know GCT is a franchise with multiple trucks that probably have some variations in menus. All I know is that this particular one in Phoenix is definitely a disappointment. Some older people I know dislike food trucks, despite all the gourmet establishments rolling around town. This is not an example of a truck you'd want to use to change that perception, but rather one that reinforces the dated notion that they all serve low-quality fast food.   $10 got me a grilled cheese with BBQ pulled pork, tots, parmesan ranch, and a can of pop.   Bread-Plain ol' grocery store bread. Small slices = small sandwich  Cheese-Tasted like store brand \"sharp\" cheddar. could barely taste it with other ingredients.  Pork-Meat was cooked correctly, but this was waaaay too sweet. Instead of a nice vinegar/BBQ flavor, it's like they just dumped some cheap sauce in and let it soak for a while. I definitely didn't like it.   Tots-plain, but at least done correctly  Parmesan ranch-Just plain ol' Heinz ranch with some dried cheese tossed in. Disappointing.  pop-Just plain Pepsi products   Overall, this is the quality of a high school lunch, not something professionally made for adult consumption. Never eat here if you have another choice."}
{"text":"I had the Fully Loaded special today for lunch and wasn't impressed at all, the pulled pork had no flavor, the mac and cheese was average and the sharp cheddar overpowered the entire sandwich. I gave it a try like I wanted to but I won't be back, for $9 I could have had something better from Food Truck Fridays."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. After my boyfriend tried to convience me not to get a grill cheese, being a chef he said he'd just make me somthing as good if not better at home, I refused and said I want to support local business and try this place because of the great reviews!  I went over alone and ordered the three cheese with blue cheese,aged cheese and one another I can't remember. Came out on a standered white peice of thin bread with a little cheese. The cheese wasn't even melted after eating half of it my boyfriend wanted to take it back and have them actually melt the cheese all the way. When he returned he told me they rudely looked at him like how dare they bring this uncooked grill cheese back.  They didn't even appoligize...said nothing at all to my boyfriend. I was okay with the bad grilled cheese but terrible customer service in the food industry...unacceptable. How can you be a grilled cheese food truck and not know how to make grilled cheese and be to over the top pricey! Wow...thank god I had an unbelievable lobster roll at the lobster ladies truck before this let down. Should of spent my hard earned cash at the pho king...never again will I support them."}
{"text":"Mmmm! I came here during the first Friday event downtown, and I ordered the grilled cheese Mac and rib sandwich, which was Mac and cheese with pulled pork over sweet BBQ sauce and it was as delicious as it sounds. It's cooked to order so there's a bit of a wait. The lady asked me if I wanted a combo for three more dollars which included either a cup of soup or tots, and a soda. I chose the tomato basil soup. It's difficult to eat soup at the festival without a table and walking around, so I regretted getting the tots. The soup would have been great with the sandwich but I ate it after my sandwich and it wasn't that great to me. It was tomatoe-y and reminded me of prego, but had it been with my sandwich, I'm sure it would have been amazing."}
{"text":"It isn't your childhood favorite grilled cheese \"samwich\" - American cheese on rainbow bread melted & browned w/margarine.  Nope, it sure wasn't a kid-favorite sandwich. It was a grown-up, way-better version of a good old American Grilled Cheese sandwich.  Double-cream Brie with bacon, smoked onion, bourbon marmalade and candied pecans all on black peppercorn bread.   And that was just one of the grown-up grilled cheese options that the Grilled Cheese Truck offered.  How about Cheesy Mac & Rib on French Bread? . . . or Buffalo Chicken Melt w/Habanero Jack & crumbled Bleu Cheese? . . . or Goat Cheese Melt w/sundried tomatoes, Basil, Spinach on Roasted Garlic Bread? . . . .or Three Cheese Melt (Gruyere, Aged White Cheddar, and Bleu Cheese)?  Of all the food truck options we tried the Saturday night we stopped in, the double-cream Brie was definitely my favorite. Would I get it again? Yep! I would, but I don't think my kids would. I may have to go home and make the American/Rainbow/margarine variety for them. Just saying . . . grown-up version. Definitely."}
{"text":"Ehhhh I had this at the food truck festival and I was so excited to have the Mac and cheese grilled cheese and it was kind of a let down. I dunno. Not my favorite truck, but I also can only give my stars on that one experience of the food. The line was super long and people were very excited about the food. I just wish maybe there was more flavor to it. Or maybe I needed a different type of sandwich."}
{"text":"Ok I can't say enough about the Bloody Mary ketchup! This food truck visited the Kierland complex (yay bc city market deli sucks) anyways, the ketchup- to die for. The tots were amazing also. I tried the French onion soup sandwich, it was so-so... Nothing I can't live without. Now, my coworkers had the Mac and cheese w/rib sandwich and I was totally jealous, because that looked amazing. I will definitely be trying that one next time (I was told it's amazing)"}
{"text":"Meh.   That's about how I describe this food truck to others. It's not horrible...but it isn't great.  I work in Downtown Phoenix and The Grilled Cheese Truck was parked outside among two other trucks: The Pizza People and a creole-themed truck. There wasn't a line at the GCT, so I figured that was somewhat of a risk, but I decided to partake anyway.  I ordered the Brie Melt which is different at this truck than online. It doesn't come with Roast Beef, but rather bacon. All around, the sandwich was not the best. It was too burned on the bread and loaded with more onions that bacon or cheese. I have read a few reviews regarding their sauce options, but the variety was lacking this time. The tater tots were cooked well. . . not burned like the sandwich.  I'll have to agree the price is a little steep for what you get. I have frequented many food trucks and paid a similar price and feel I had better quality food and presentation than this place.   Would I try it again? Perhaps. If there are no other food trucks I am interested in giving a try, then I may opt for another go."}
{"text":"Grilled mac and cheese was good, tater tots were nice and crispy but half were fresh and half were kind of cold. The tomato soup is like marinara sauce, I threw most of it away. Not worth $12, but I would probably buy the sandwich again. Would have been 4 stars if I had only gotten the sandwich."}
{"text":"Yum! Got the Cheesy Mac & Rib and it was delicious! The tater tots were hot and crispy (spectacular dipped in their chipotle mayo). It is definitely pricey for a sandwich and a side, especially considering the fact that this is a food truck.   If they show up near my work again, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"After a great meeting at CO+HOOTS, my boss and I decided to check out the Grilled Cheese Food Truck parked outside. We split the Grilled Mac and Rib and a side of perfectly crispy tots! I know these sandwiches are probably not on my diet, but sometimes it's worth a special treat! I tried the bloody mary ketchup and it was a little spicy, but really good. I also had to have a side of regular ketchup for dipping my tots, but that's a personal problem. Some have called me a ketchup addict. Maybe, but I happen to think it's under control!    Good idea for a successful small business. There aren't many people that don't like a good grilled cheese sandwich. How about a little tomato soup on the side in the future? Sounds like an amazing combo to entice men and women, alike!"}
{"text":"Grilled goat cheese with butternut, cran-pear relish, and spiced pecans on 9-grain... Festive, but you know what'll really take that vegetarian grilled cheese up a notch? Ditching the squash and adding BBQ pork ribs.*  Since these sammies take a small eternity to come out, don't stay together well, and cost a pretty 1,000 pennies, I have to dock a couple stars. The BBQ rib creation really is fairly tasty, though.  *may not be vegetarian according to certain standards."}
{"text":"Grilled mac n rib...... when I think about making a sandwich I usually don't think about putting mac n cheese on it... that being said I ordered the mac n cheese on the side with the \"rib\" part and some grilled onions along with cheese on the sandwich. The food was great, and very flavorful. But for $8 before tax is a bit expensive.... a regular old grilled American is $3 and if you want extras it is even more... so minus one for the price but the food itself is really good.... I wish they had hamburger patties though.... I have a feeling they would make an amazing patty melt."}
{"text":"Was really hoping to enjoy this truck. I ordered the pretzel bread chicken bratwurst melt (name?), Mac and cheese melt and standard american cheese for my daughters.    I'm willing to wait for good food but this was just meh. My bratwurst came on regular white bread and while it was super tasty I'm bummed about the bread error as I think that made the whole sandwich. Mac and cheese melt was too charred for my daughter to eat. Filling was extremely thin. Regular old grilled cheese was charred too and the other kid didn't want it either.  Couldn't get tots because there was a problem with fryer and it was just warming up so quite a wait. So I passed.  I'm torn about whether to try them again when there are so many other reliable trucks. Menu looks fabulous but execution really needs some work."}
{"text":"We've gone to food truck caravan 3 times now and these guys have been there every time.  The lines are always the longest at this truck so we avoided them the first two times.  This last time we got to food truck caravan early so we decided to try Grilled Cheese while the line was short.  We ordered the Fully Loaded which is a grilled cheese with Mac and cheese and BBQ pulled pork on French bread.  Not surprising, it was very good.  We also ordered a grilled banana French toast, which was just ok.  As good as the Fully Loaded is, it was still a little pricy.  Also, I wouldn't wait the long lines for it.  So for those two reasons I took away a star.  Other than that, they do make a nice grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Food=4 or 5 stars.  Service= 2.  We went here at the Farmer's Market on Central and Northern.   I believe there was just one guy cooking.  It was almost 15 minutes for one, plain grilled cheese sandwich.  It was amazing when we got it and pretty much worth the 3.00, but the wait was WAY too long.  I couldn't go to this at Food Truck Friday if I were on a schedule or needed to be somewhere.  Seems that slow service is a trend here with the reviews.  Must be the product/cooking- you can't make ahead, clearly, so the production is a challenge.  I would go again if I wasn't in a hurry- or at ALL in a hurry.  Friendly service.. just REALLY slow."}
{"text":"Not bad. Got the Mac 'n Rib grilled cheese sandwich. 8 bucks. I was pretty hungry but it sounded like a filling sandwich. Not so much broskis. Wish they woulda packed a little more mac n cheese on the Sammy or on the side and I'd slide this review right up to 4 stars. Or some tots. Oh well. Solid sandwich all in all, makes my grilled cheeses look like amateur hour."}
{"text":"I was actually going to the Pho King truck for lunch at Camelback Colonnade, but they ran out of containers for pho. *blank stare*  So I was happy that the Grilled Cheese truck happened to be there too.  I ordered the three cheese with the tots combo to go.  I came back to my office and devoured my food.  The sandwich was really good, although it was almost a little too \"grilled\" for me -- meaning the bread was a little dark for my taste.  The tots were bomb, especially with their special tots seasoning and the parmesan ranch dip.  Add an orange Fanta to that, and I can't even imagine how many calories I just ate.  I guess my thoughts of skipping the gym today are just that...thoughts.  I'll definitely be there, but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try and was sadly let down. I had the sun dried tomato goat cheese,  sounded so gourmet but was like it was blended all together and slipped on tiny pieces of bread. It was. So bad. Sorry wont be back. Could not even get kids to eat the grilled cheese :("}
{"text":"I ordered the special of the day, which was a grilled cheese with ham, caramelized onions and fresh avocado grilled on buttery French bread. It came with a fairly large portion of tater tots (comparable to a LARGE order of Sonic tots), as well as a free dipping sauce. Their Bloody Mary dipping sauce is the most popular and very tasty. I also tried their Parmesan Ranch dipping sauce, which was absolute perfection with the tots. This was a VERY heavy meal for a lunch. Next time I might split meal with a co-worker or just opt for the sandwich and dipping sauce.    The Grilled Cheese Truck is part of the Ride and Dine Food Trucks that travel around for events.  I hope they come back to the State Capitol for Food Truck Wednesdays or Food Truck Fridays because the food trucks involved in those events are gourmet, fresh, good quality and worth the splurge.    Here is their menu, as well as their travel schedule (click on Phoenix).   http://www.thegrilledcheesetruck.com/Pages/menus.aspx"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to shell out $8 for just a sandwich after all the low reviews but it beat having ramen noodles for lunch. I went with the Mac & Rib and to be honest the first couple bites weren't mind blowing and the sandwich itself is nothing to look at but the deeper you got the more delicious it became. The flavors weren't crazy just basics that were blended well and made for a good sandwich. I love bbq so the pulled pork was my fave, they give you a decent amount and it wasn't too sweet either. Overall food was yummy and hit the spot, staff was friendly but I think $6-7 for just the sandwich by itself would have been more adequate but really no qualms."}
{"text":"I got an American Cheese Melt with turkey added on and tots and the bloody mary ketchup. The cheese was decent, the meat was not the best especially for that price you pay. The best part was the bloody mary ketchup. The drink selection was so lame. All they had was Pepsi or diet Pepsi. No light soda choices. The tots were amazing! All in all it was A-OK."}
