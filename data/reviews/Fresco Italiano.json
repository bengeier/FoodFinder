{"text":"Excellente!  Food was delicious enough that we visited twice during our week stay.  Penne Arrabbiata was very well made with a true dente finish.  Chicken Parm was spot on.  The garlic bread is a must here, it's some of the best I've ever had.    The real treat was on my second visit I asked for Angel Hair pasta, Arrabbiata style, and specifically requested it to be as spicy as humanly possible.  The chef pulled it off marvelously, it was perfectly spicy to my high Scoville-unit  tastes and quite delicious."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre italian food. Clumped pasta - what Italian restaurant can't cook their pasta properly? We sent one entree back, the ceasar salad just had a couple of anchovies laid on top instead of in the dressing as it should be, the garlic bread (two little tiny thin slices of little tiny bread) served with the ceasar was HARD. And no bread served with the entrees! Dinner for 4 with waters to drink - more than $120.00 This should be against the law."}
{"text":"im 100 percent italian from chicago been living in las vegas since 2007 thank you fresco's finally real old school italian food.  The lasagne is to die for like my grandma use to make  and minestrone soup has the best flavor doesn't need cheese.  my best friend had shrimp diavlo was amazing and the chef will make it as bland or spicy as you like.  There wine list was impressive brunello and barolo.   all pasta is homemade and you can tell from the intricately shaped macaroni and fresh taste its not boxed barilla pasta that most restaurants use.   the portions were so large i didn't have room for dessert next time I'm trying the panicotta.  pete was our waiter he was wonderful felt like i knew him for years.  great restaurant for a remodeled casino  see you soon pete thanks for the doggy bag"}
{"text":"Sometimes dining alone is annoying! Because I'm single... and dressed for air travel, the hostess automatically seated me in the bar area next to a giant TV. After about five minutes, I couldn't take it anymore and asked to be moved to a quieter less in ur face table in the restaurant. Despite the restaurant being empty, because it was so early, I was relocated in the hallway on patio chairs instead of the restaurant. Kind of bullshit. I just want a good meal in a nice, quiet restaurant. Is that too much to ask? Or is it too distracting to have a girl dining alone in a semi fancy restaurant?   Needless to say, because I was sitting in the hallway, I did not have a server. The manager or chef did not come over. My table was not comfortable. I was not offered fresh parm or pepper. I did not have waitstaff checking on me. I was basically ignored the entire meal. Meanwhile, the patrons seated in he restaurant were catered to. Offered water, coffee, a second beverage etc... if I am paying the same price for my meal as the people seated in the restaurant I deserve to be treated the same way! If you are seated in this no man's land. Ask to be moved. The chairs are the worst! I have better chairs on my deck. Hell. There are better chairs at the pool upstairs.  On to the food- Chicken Piccata- or should I say chicken nada! First, I'm not sure if the chef understands what piccata is. Not only is this chicken on the bone... which is NOT how you make piccata. A piccata is a sliced lightly floured fillet which has been tenderized and saut√©ed in a lemon based stock. (Just a personal note: Having the bone sticking up like that, looks thoroughly unappetizing.)  Piccata should be a light delicate and tender piece of meat, which should melt in your mouth. The chicken at Fresco was on the bone, tough, not floured, and had no note of lemon whatsoever. Hello... One of the main ingredients of any piccata is lemon chef! Instead, the chicken was lightly dressed with a flavorless stock rue, caramelized onions, three capers and four green olives.   The sauce on the chicken had zero flavor, but did manage to leave me with a heavy butter residue in my mouth. The dish was served with noodles which were also heavily soaked in butter (or perhaps that fake liquid butter byproduct). Although the pasta was probably freshly frozen, it had the look, taste, and mouth feel of cheap ramen. I don't know about you, but when I come to an Italian restaurant, the last thing I want to eat is reconstituted ramen.   At the end of the day, I'm not sure who prepared this dish, but who ever did, doesn't know what piccata is. I think this is   probably one of the worst renditions of piccata I have ever eaten. (And I have eaten a lot of piccata). If you are going to charge $26 for a dish, you should at least prepare something that resembles an actual piccata instead of butter drenched ramen noodles.  While I was sitting here, I had to ask myself who is rating this place 4 stars? Although their wine list was good, and the bartenders were super nice, the food was subpar at best- especially for the price. The reviewers of this restaurant must not know much about fresh, good quality food.   One final note, as a woman who often travels (and eats) alone, I don't appreciate being seated in the bar next to a giant TV. I don't appreciate not being seated with the rest of the patrons in the dining room. I didn't appreciate that no one checked on me throughout the meal. And I certainly didn't appreciate being charged the same fine dining price for a subpar experience. The only reason I rated this location 2 stars instead of 1 is because the wine selection was good, the bartenders were very accommodating and nice and the restaurant had a decent ambiance. Otherwise I would say this was a thoroughly unenjoyable experience and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was really good. Brianna was really helpful with making decisions on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was slightly above average and a little over priced. Service was terrible. Took over an hour for us just to get our salads. Only reason we got our entrees is because we threatened to leave."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas!  We had family style banquet here a few days ago. Not only food was delicious but the service was the best!  Michael sang to us with the beautiful voice & Angelo helped with nice, gentle smile & great service!  I highly recommend for everyone to try. Many thanks to Chef Larry for making delicious meal!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Incredible food and the singing by Michael Baker was off the charts! He serenaded our friend Nila. We can't wait to come back! Get the calamari and the chopped salad."}
{"text":"They stayed open for us 5 to eat late as it was after 9pm on a weekday. A plus right there. The drinks were large enough to enjoy a buzz. Appetizers we had 3 of them a cesar salad, sausage & peppers & linguine w/fresh clams All were excellent. Service was top notch. The Executive Chef Michael came out, greeted and chatted w/us so I really enjoyed that hands on w/the customer. We will be returning."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Alfredo pasta. If I could give it a 100/10 that would be so awesome. The food was very flavorful, and warm with the right amount of sauce from the pasta. The management was GREAT. Michael along with the other staff members gave me such a great experience (especially for my FIRST time) dinning at this restaurant. My boyfriend doesn't particularly like pasta but when he had some of mine he LOVED it, which is surprising. Overall, I would defiantly come here again and recommend people as well. Super satisfied."}
{"text":"Michael is the best! Simply amazing. His service is impeccable and he won't disappoint. Please visit him and if you're lucky he will sing for you."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time! I was in the mood for some good Italian food. That did not happen. We ordered calamari and it was not fresh ....very rubbery. We ordered the minestrone soup and it was like eating marinara sauce. Yuk. The chopped salad was just chopped lettuce. My husband ordered angel hair pasta with chicken and when it arrived at the table it was cold. Horrible food. Do your self a favor and keep walking."}
{"text":"From the beginning it was Bad, waiting to be seated and I was completely ignored.  My waitress only took my order never came back didn't offer me any of the house bread. They brought my lasagna it was very blend I needed to add salt and I had to flag another waiter down.  For the prices in this place you would think you would have better service. Very disappointed I should've just gone to the deli. I had to have somebody else to give my check to. I just regret not taking a picture and showing the look of my plate. Very sad"}
{"text":"Fresco's.   Located in the Westgate!  Yes!   Fabulous food, fabulous service, generous portions, and reasonable prices.    Beautiful ambiance and pleasant surrounding for conversation. Pete, our waiter, and Jonathan, the Manager, were congenial, professional, knowledge and made this a  positive dining experience.   The shrimp scampi and chicken piccata were the best we have ever eaten.  Give it a try...you won't be disappointed!  Look forward to visiting Fresco's again!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews they do not fit the description of service i received. The server was very polite and brought drinks over promptly. food was great and came in a timely manner. When reading reviews you have to be careful because  I used to work in the food business myself and the person writing the review could have been very difficult to work with and could have been giving the staff a hard time. Sometimes people walk in expecting a bad service. Give Fresco Italiano a try you wont regret it! I promise ."}
{"text":"Food was great, service and attention to customer satisfaction was outstanding.  Mariah is a jewel."}
{"text":"Last month I was able to trying Fresco Italiano and the food was outstanding. The calamari was on point, the Chicken Parm made me miss New York and the atmosphere was extremely relaxing. Chef Mike Mcneilly stopped by our table to make sure everything was alright and we ended up talking about food for 20 mins. You could tell how passionate he is about the quality of the food he produces. I would highly recommenced this to everyone and would suggest trying to reserve one of there private dining areas for a more intimate experience."}
{"text":"My server Michael Baker was OUTSTANDING!! He was a complete delight and if you have a chance to ask for him- DO! He will make your day :)"}
{"text":"Danyella was awesome. She gave us great suggestions and was very friendly. If you come here ask for her and you will receive great service!"}
{"text":"I was a member of a large group (12 people). The waiter (Carlos) was very attentive to everybody and very prompt. I had the Bone-In Veal Marsala. This came over angel hair pasta. It was in Carlos' words, \"Mmmm Sweet Baby Jesus\". The veal was very tender and was a very large portion. The Marsala sauce was very flavorful. Others near me had Lasagna, which looked to be about 10 layers thick. Another had the pork chops with a spicy marinara sauce. This also looked very appetizing. Everybody was pleased with their meals. I think it was on the pricey side of things, but I was not paying the bill so it didn't matter to me. This place is hidden inside the Westgate Resort ( the old LVH) near the convention center."}
{"text":"For a spur of moment choice, I must say the food was excellent. Our waitress Andrea was very friendly and attentive as was all the staff we had contact with. The chicken Marsala was so good, unique flavor and just the right portion. Left room for a refreshing serving of mint chocolate gelato. Perfect way to cap our meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. Pete was our server and he was very hospitable! Perfect end of our day!"}
{"text":"The food was good (I had the bolognese), but our server Michael Baker was full of energy and entertaining. He even ended the dinner with a caricature drawing for us. If you go, ask for Michael!"}
{"text":"I was dreading eating out by myself, but my bartenders Rebecca and Mariah made my experience more than extraordinary. They were both very attentive while keeping a positive attitude the entire time. Despite the intense amount of volume flowing through the restaurant, they maintained a great vibe for fellow guests. I would recommend this place for exceptional service as well as delicious menu choices."}
{"text":"I should have listen to the reviews. I normally don't write reviews, but this place really stinks. I was hesitant to go after reading the reviews, but I figured I give it a try for myself. I sat at the bar and ordered some fried calamari as an appetizer and a salad as my main course. The calamari took forever and when I received, it was overcooked.  After another 20-30 minutes I asked about my salad and it was never made. This is probably the worst dining I've had in Vegas, I should have just ate at a food court and gotten better service and better food:"}
{"text":"Excellent delicious food. We enjoyed the atmosphere and quiet romantic air. Wish the waiter would have been a bit more attentive. But overall flavor superseded catering."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken pram and it came with just a fried, soggy piece of chicken on a plate... Even had a bone left in it. Chicken was also pretty fatty so they evidently didn't trim anything. No pasta served with it.... Just the chicken.  My co-worker ordered a strip streak and it had quite a bit of fat on it as well. Approx 20% of his steak was fat.  Service was ok but they weren't that busy so I expected good service. I won't eat here again... Too many options to do this again. Way over priced in my opinion."}
{"text":"The place is pricey for pretty plain pastas. The shrimp diavlo was ok but the sauce reminds me from a jar. The bolognese sauce just taste like ground beef. The spicy marinara is spicy but good. And the garlic bread was cold. Not the quality I would expect with the price. Never go there!"}
{"text":"This was an A+ restaurant, fantastic service from the greeter, server and the cook. From start to finish everything was fantastic. We initially wanted to dine in but shortly after our appetizers were served we decided to go back to our room to rest after an exhausting day. Our server Pete was and still is the best server we could have asked for. He was polite,  courteous, quick and accommodating to our specific needs. The food was perfectly cooked and everything was delicious.  We sincerely appreciate his professionalism and will definitely return."}
{"text":"We were part of a Wedding party that ate here. The food was very good and most of all the waiters Michael and Angelo were the BEST. If you go there and I highly suggest you do.. have Michael sing for you!"}
{"text":"I have never in my 60+ years been kicked out of a restaurant, that is until Fresco Italiano! My business partner and I were looking forward to a staycation at the Westgate, as we need to be available 24-7 for our educational internet business, and taking an overnight stay is a big deal for us, and requires a lot of planning ahead. We ordered 3 courses to share, and were looking forward to them, as it was after 6, and we hadn't had a chance to eat all day.   As we were waiting for our meal, we were served stale bread made of whole grains, of which I am allergic. I am Italian in the strictest sense of upbringing, and NEVER did our family serve anything but a good crusty white Italian bread. OK, not a big deal, still excited about our food to come.  One of the waitresses was wearing a political T-shirt, and we found it offensive as she passed our table several times. Does politics need to enter your dining experience while on vacation? Is there any place you can go to relax, and forget about the political climate? Apparently not, at Fresco Italiano. Both of us were stunned that she would be permitted to dress this way at work. Are there no dress code rules anymore? At Fresco Italiano, it seems OK by management that their staff display political statements on their tees.  We asked for the manager to discuss the fact that her waitress was being inappropriate, and that it made us uncomfortable. Just wanted to let her know that, so they may consider the fact that they are offending some of  their customers, and to possibly change their dress policy. What we got was totally unexpected. The manager, who couldn't have been more than 25 years old, the offending waitress, and a large, threatening thug appeared at our table all at once. All this, for two old ladies! What we got was defensive arguments, and we were told to leave if we didn't like it. Expletives were exchanged! We were told F you! At that point, we just left, not to cause any escalation.   Btw, I want to say that I would not have had a bad reaction to a patron of the restaurant wearing a shirt that promoted a political agenda. I see that all the time, whether it is a bumper sticker, a  hat, or a t-shirt. But when people who work at a place are putting their agenda in my face as a customer, I feel intimidated, uncomfortable, and possibly threatened.    For instance, now I'd better be careful what I say as someone in management could overhear, and deliver consequences in my meal, perhaps without me ever knowing (got to check that meal carefully before eating!)Seeing people constantly having violence done to them, in public for expressing their views is the norm now, and has made possible feelings like mine, and experiences like this. I'm writing to the President of Westgate next.  So, watch out about your politics here. If you are a Republican, you will be discriminated against, and hated on for your political beliefs."}
{"text":"This is the second that I have been there. The food was good but the service was a little slow. It took a couple of times to ask for extra plates for our food. Our waiter accidentally spilled water on us and he apologized and they promptly cleaned it up. In spite of the water spill and the slow service it was very good. And yes I will go back."}
{"text":"Great food! I loved the Fresh Burratta and salamis. We had the Ribeye and it was cooked perfectly.   Chef Michael recommended a few antipasto's that we normally avoid but here were fantastic. The fresh ingredients really come through with the classic recipes.   My wife was a big fan of the Penne Bolognese. We will definitely be coming back while in Vegas. Gotta appreciate quality when you see it. Order the Antipasto, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was very good! Calamari was amazing! I had the bone in ribeye for dinner. I loved the taste. We choose to go there for my birthday dinner and I'm glad we did. The manager Jonathan was adorable and funny. The only downfall was our server who made us feel like we were bothering him. I definitely recommend the food!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Food was delicious, the Staff were all nice and friendly, and Chef Mike especially was amazing. Definitely coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"On 4/26/16 my husband and I came in to the restaurant hungry ready to eat some Italian food. When we walked in the was a young lady waiting to seat us! she was very friendly and had a great personality!! She made my husband and I laugh as she was seating us! Thank you Amanda for the great customer service you gave us! We will be back to eat here again!! Dinner was great!! Thank you again Amanda!! Hope T/L/Store"}
{"text":"Fresco Italiano was a restaurant we had not heard of but since we were heading to a show at the West Gate we decided to give it a go. It was our 24th anniversary and we were celebrating and also in the mood for Italian.  Made a reservation showed up on time and we were lead to a lovely private area up a few steps for just the 2 of us. This was a great start to a lovely dining experience we felt like VIP's in there. Our server was Andy she was very attentive and explained the menu in detail about family style portions.       Drinks were well made and the food was very nicely presented and very tasty. The highlight of our meal was the service we received from Andy. She was passionate about her job and truly loves it and it shows in how she treats guests. Bad service can make a great meal bad and excellent service can make a very good meal great. Turns out our meal was excellent thanks to Andy.  Andy thanks for making our anniversary dinner so special we very much appreciated meeting you and will be back to see you again for our next Vegas trip! :)"}
{"text":"Food & wine was great if you enjoy good food!   1 star since, I wasn't able to enjoy my dinner comfortably due to the excessive amount of gnats.   Gnats were all over the food & even my drinks.   Definitely would have been higher rating if it wasn't for the gnats.   Not sure if I would revisit this place again."}
{"text":"This place was just one disappointment after another. First off, they have a very limited lunch menu. I'm one of those that always check out the menu and have in mind what I wanted to order before going to a restaurant and when we sat down and was handed the menu, we really wanted to jump up and leave ... we should have.  My boyfriend couldn't decide what he wanted and he finally decided on the fettucine and the waiter was like, nah, you don't want that, you want the spaghetti and meatballs. So fine, we agreed... what a huge mistake... the sauce was watery and the meatballs were dry that my boyfriend couldn't even eat it.   When we told the waiter hey, FYI, you may want to recommend something else to your patrons next time because this was not good. The waiter (Joseph, I think), instead of being apologetic was like \"well, everyone else likes it.\" Really??!!! Why are you so defensive, it's not like you cooked the meatballs!   So, we swear we would never go back but unfortunately we were invited to a birthday dinner and that was the place the birthday boy wanted to go. We didn't want to ruin it for him and maybe the second time would be better... WRONG.  We walked in and get seated and guess who our server is... Joseph or whatever his name was...bald guy from Chicago. The reason why I know it's the bald guy from Chicago because as soon as he found out that we were from Sacramento, CA all he wanted to talk about was how far our Giants was going to get vs his Chicago Cubs. We asked for water 5 times and the dude was too busy talking (spitting too, may I add) about who we got and who his team has...Mistake #1  Also, instead of getting our water, he wanted to comment on my shirt by saying, \"oh you like Michael Jackson\" as he does the hip forward head back Jackson move. I'm like, I'm wearing a Barrett Jackson shirt which has nothing to do with Michael Jackson. In my mind I really wanted to say, \"Why don't you just do your job and bring us our water that we have been waiting for for like 1/2 hour now.\" But I refrain because we haven't received our food yet either and you don't want to pisst off your waiter before you get your food... Mistake #2  Then he brings us bottled water which none of us asked for. He brought us 5 bottles and none of us like bubbly water. We just want regular water. We were like, hey, we didn't order so we ain't paying for it. He said fine, he's got it covered. We left three bottles untouched but the cap was open...I hope he doesn't serve it to another table...that was mistake #3.  Mistake #4, one of our friends ordered a bread appetizer for herself, he somehow dediced to bring out four orders for the entire table and charged.   Dinner dishes were a hit and miss. Mine was good but I ordered it off the menu. Apparently, even though they have not been open for very long, they have already changed their menu. A lot of the things that you see on Yelp, they do not have on their menu anymore. Several of our friends did not finish their dishes because they said it was very bland.   If you want to gamble (pun intended) and hope you get a professional waiter or order the good dish, by all means, give it a try, otherwise, I would put my $$ elsewhere."}
{"text":"So delicious! The meatballs and the pasta carbonara were exceptional. I loved the olive bread. I was so stuffed. Everything was so good that I ate way too much."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and excellent food. I will eat here again when I'm in Las Vegas. My son had the goat cheese bruschetta appetizer which was entree sized. I had a \"build your own pasta\" menu option. I choose the penne pasta with an Alfredo sauce and grilled chicken. The pasta was perfectly prepared al dente the way I like it. For dessert we had the home made cannoli and gelato which we shared. When at the Westgate I would check this restaurant out!"}
{"text":"Oh man Why Oh Why.... Honestly the food wasn't that bad.... The appetizer was sufficient... The Risotto was decent.... The Chiante was good.... The thing that bothered me the most is they had these freaking gnats, flies, whatever they were all over the place the entire meal! Instead of enjoying my food...I kept watching these things fly around and trying to get them the HELL Away from my food!!!! Seriously....I'm not sure what they can do about that...but their excuse was really bad in my opinion.... I've eaten at Benihana here before and didn't have the same issue...but who knows maybe it's the time of the year?"}
{"text":"Stayed at Westgate Las Vegas for about 5 days. I think this place represents Westgate, yes! That good! However, only one server was serving my table area. So, I asked a favor to another server who was passing by, but the server was ignorant. Is it because I'm an Asian? Btw.., I'm an American, and in fact, I live here in Vegas, NOT TOURIST. What the?? Do I deserve this?? I will think about going back there again.  The taste was good tho. Two thumbs up for the kitchen ppl. They deserve credits!"}
{"text":"Pros: Food was really good! I had the Fettuccini Alfredo and it was amazing, the sauce was so rich in flavor!   Cons: A bit pricey Service was so so.   Overall would still come back just for that Alfredo!"}
{"text":"Pete our waiter made our experience incredible. He was awesome and the food was great. I would recommend starting with meat appetizer and the bread was great. We will definitely go again next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 pastas.  Bolognese was excellent, definitely recommend.  Carbonara was passable, but it's definitely not real Carbonara, basically cream sauce with meat. No egg, no bacon, no onions.  Fettucine was tasteless.  Arabiata was absolutely horrendous, there was no flavor, it was spicy for the sake of being spicy and the tomato sauce tasted like it came straight out of a world war 2 bomb shelter.  Added to this the pasta felt undercooked and the service was horrible, definitely take your business to Benihana."}
{"text":"The best Italian food, I have ever had!!! You can feel the love and passion that goes into it,the staff is very knowledgeable what wines should paired with what, Chef Michael, Chef Rob and the Manager Jonathan, take the time to come out and talk to you.  We ordered the meat and cheese platter and the amazing part is it's different each time, what ever they have flown in is what they serve... Each time NEVER a disappointment. Another item we get is the meatballs, it reminds me of my Italian grandmas Sunday dinners totally takes me back to my childhood. This visit we tried the calamari again delicious lightly breaded but crispy and seasoned to perfection.. When we are in town and even if we aren't staying at the Westgate it's a must we eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"Recently dined at Fresco as part of hospitality dining experience. Had an opportunity to enjoy so many of the wonderful and classic Italian dishes from Chef Paola Bogli. Definitely one of the top recommendations for dining at the Westgate especially if you're looking for classic Italian cuisine featuring fine dining but a casual environment. The manager Dora is so pleasant and we had some many staff taking care of us that night but Danyella, Andrea and Michael stood out. If you have a chance, check it out - you won't be disappointed and you'll definitely leave full! :-)"}
{"text":"1st off...never trust a Yelp review written by someone from New York. Or the majority of the east coast in general. They will always tell you that the food sucks. (Referring to another review of Fresca)  Anyways, we loved the atmosphere in here! It was so nice to get away from the hussle and hussle of the rest of the resort for a bit.  Our waitress was super sweet and attentive! I think her name was Rebecca.  We ordered the classic bruschetta which was absolutely amazing! The bread they serve with oil and balsamic to dip was so good and authentic Italian style!  I ordered gnocchi with their spicy marinara. Typically, I have low expectations on the \"spicy\" scale, especially at an Italian restaurant, but boy was it spicy! It was so good!  My husband ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo. He loved it. I also tried it and was pretty impressed.  The prices were also fair, especially considering that it's Vegas and comparing prices of the other food establishments in the Westgate."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Italian meal. Based in the West Gate, which by the way is a super nice place inside, this little Italian restaurant is not crazy busy and still has some really good dishes. Loved the pasta and the options they had were good as well.   I went with a client and coworker and we had a great time. Service was great which is always a plus, and being in the West Gate the prices were a bit lower for Vegas. Overall I would go back for sure if I'm nearby and want some decent italian."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Italian restaurant I have been to. The Fettuccine Alfredo is to die for and the staff is so pleasant. The restaurant itself is clean and the atmosphere is perfect. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for authentic Italian food!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here twice during our stay. First night we came with hubby's business friends. The second night, just the two of us. We liked the first visit because the food was delicious and the service was exceptional. The second night we returned   wasn't as good. First night we had the flatbread to share as a start. Then we had Caesar salad with anchovies. Then I ordered shrimp Fia Diavolo and hubby had Veal Chop. Everything we had was excellent. Hubby's friends also agreed that the food was delicious. However I couldn't finish my meal so I took half to go. Our waitress, Andy, was friendly and super professional. She took good care of our table. Thanks for assigning her to our table. I also ordered my meal thru her recommendation but I couldn't finish because that's how I eat pasta - half the plate. The anchovies was pretty good too, slightly different than the one I use on my Caesar salad. Our second visit didn't go as smoothly until Andy came to take over the service. Our server was probably overwhelmed by too many patrons coming from too many expos nearby or he could be a new server. The restaurant seemed crowded. However Andy saved the day. She took over serving our table. We had Caesar salad with anchovies, Chicken  Piccata and Chicken Marsala. Unfortunately the salad didn't taste the same. There's 1-2 anchovies mixing in the salad, not a lot like the first visit. Chicken Piccata and Marsala were nothing special. If you really have to settle with chicken, between the two I would suggest the Marsala. If you don't mind getting anything, you can try the veal chop because hubby and his friend agreed the veal was delicious here. If you can't decide, just get the flatbread. If you just can't make up your mind, why don't you just have some drink and ride one of the two scooters that's being displayed at the entrance. That stuff seems too cool not to try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner last night and the is by far the best Italian food we have tasted in a while. We had the chicken parmigiana and the fettuccine Alfredo. The portion size was generous and the wine selection was reasonable and diverse. Out waitress, Kimberly, was awesome! We will definitely go back our next time in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I had the filet mignon and it came with more than I had expected. The filet had a side of potatoes and shrimp and even had a strawberry that was cut to resemble a rose!!! It was an amazing experience and all for a really good price!"}
{"text":"Had such a great time tonight! Food was amazing and such hospitable service from Jose! Thanks again for an awesome date night!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was amazing! I had the chicken marsala and it was to die for. Not only that but all of the staff was amazing especially Amanda! She was extremely nice and we had no wait. Definitely will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. After asking three times, didn't even get water until midway through the entree. Salad was over dresses and pasta was over cooked and mushy. Cancelled the wine after finishing our meal. Had to ask three times for the check. Sad that it was my last meal of my trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Save your money. Go to a buffet. Food very unimpressive, especially given the price.  Hostess was not welcoming and waiter service way tooo slow."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service at the bar tonight.  It's Monday, so presumably slower night but I was happy not to wait!  Had the spaghetti bolongese.  I might have enjoyed it a bit more with a breadstick or grated parm.  I wasn't offered, but I didn't ask either. Overall, very meaty and filling. Maybe next time I'll ask for some bread and cheese."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Until last night, I have never had a truly bad meal in Las Vegas. We have visited many, many times for business as well as pleasure and this was awful.  We asked for 7 pm reservation and told the \"earliest seating for six people would be 7:30.\" Yet, when we arrived the restaurant was not even half full.  We tried so very hard to order a bottle of wine, yet every selection was not available. After the server's third unsuccessful trip, we asked \"what do you have?\" and chose his suggestion. Yet, even that was unavailable. It should not take five trips (and almost 45 minutes) to get a bottle of wine! Adding insult to injury, the guy who poured the wine mentioned a special on a good quality wine (less expensive than what we ordered) and said we should have ordered that! Of course, by then it was too late.  Finally, we ordered food and the disappointment continued. Very slow kitchen and awful results: rare steak was medium well; medium rare steak was done to shoe leather texture; spaghetti and meatballs was missing the meatballs; risotto was cold;  minestrone was bland; chicken piccata was not piccata cutlet style but chicken on the bone; and request for freshly ground pepper on salad was met with a finger pointing to pepper on the table.  I sent my steak back and said take it off the bill and opted to skip dinner. Didn't have much hope for anything better based on my companions' results. The final straw was the 20% gratuity automatically added since we were a \"large party.\" Six people is \"large?\" And there were only five entrees since I did not eat!  The ONLY good thing to say about the place is that it is convenient if you are a Westgate guest. Otherwise, take the monorail, walk, take an Uber/Lyft/cab, or whatever and and go anywhere else! Please save yourself from an expensive hideous experience."}
{"text":"Chef Mike is the heart and soul of this place and his passion for quality ingredients and customer service are impossible to miss. He makes a point to visit each table and ensure quality food and service. You truly feel like a valued diner. Portions are huge and decor is very comforting. We had the pesto grilled baguette to start which was crunchy and flavorful. Next the homemade meatball (Chef's family recipe from Italy); they were super delicate (huge) and covered with a tangy marinara sauce. Then the calamari..I've been kinda burned out on calamari because we order it so often, but this was fantastic. The batter had a new spice blend, was light and crunchy and the tarragon garlic aioli was superb. Then we shared the chopped salad (HUGE). Great textures, flavors and quality ingredients! I'm not a big salad fan, so to rave about lettuce speaks volumes. For entrees we had the branzino stuffed with San marzano tomatoes and on a bed of bitter greens; super flaky and served in a really cute cast iron fish and a 22 oz bone in rib eye. (seasoned perfectly and cooked as ordered). We managed to finish with the banana peanut butter gelato before we had to waddle out of there. Great night and wonderful experience. They also have a wood burning oven, we'll have to try the flatbread/pizzas when we go back! Wish they were open for lunch! Great job!"}
{"text":"I was really expecting better. I LOVE LOVE LOVE pasta. Its my thing. But this place left me feeling sad and not satisfied.   So first off I come here with my best friend and husband while staying here for rollercon 2016. Been wanting to try it out all week and we come in on a Friday. It isn't busy yet and we get seated right away. Our server comes by, gives us our menus and tells us the specials. He comes back to take our meal order and our drinks. Basically the LAST we ever see of him unless we physically flag him down.   Now again I would like to say that although we came on a Friday night it isn't terribly busy and there are still open seating to be had. So I am not unfair to think that I would like to have re-fills of my drinks or a check in to see how we are doing.   The food was okay. But for the price that we paid I really expect 'melt in  your mouth' or 'oh this is wonderful' responses from my taste buds. But sadly I was underwhelmed. I can only say it was 'okay'. And that is just not acceptable."}
{"text":"No very good Service was slow Chicken was super salty  Pasta was big but sauce was nothing special   Very expensive for the quality   Quantity was good , better to have less food and Better quality ."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was because we ordered the $20 special or not but felt like our server mentally checked out after we initially placed the order.   First, we had no idea the \"garlic bread for the table\" cost $4.  Next,  our drinks sat empty several times.   Server would give us drive-by service, not stopping to ask if we needed anything.   He didn't check on us after someone else delivered entrees until we were  done, waiting to order our 2nd plate (since all u can eat pasta).  Whole thing took so  long, we lost our   appetite waiting.    Fettucine Alfredo was good,  but  spaghetti marinara was watery."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience! We had dinner the other night and was fortunate to meet with Chef Mike and GM Jonathan. We recommend for our meal that Chef send this out whatever he preferred.  The first round was a beautiful charcuterie board with mostly sausages and meats direct from Italy and some in-house made cheeses.  Chef also included a delicious spicy chorizo-like pate from Italy called nucia (?). I couldn't find the spelling for it anywhere and he didn't have it on the menu yet. He put this delight also on the little neck clams that came out next. It was wonderful. Chef surprised us with flat bread made with lardo and pig jowl.  I wish I would've got a picture of it because it was as appealing visually as it was on the palate.  Our meal also included a beautiful grilled branzino and a bone in veal chop Parmigiano. Both were excellent and we could not even finish our entr√©es.  We enjoyed some reasonably priced wines to enhance our meal.  Everybody was very attentive and it turned into a four-hour dining experience. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"Not too busy at 8:30PM but waited forever to get a drink. Had to ask for bread and butter. Had to ask a 2nd time to get butter. No water. 2nd drink took forever. Spaghetti was Asian noodles with bland meatballs and sauce. What's going on here? I thought this was Vegas. Clearly not. Don't bother with anything at Westgate Hotel."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a group of 10. Jose was our waiter and was incredibly attentive and accommodating. His friendly service was a good sign of what was to come. The food was Amazing! Chef Mike came out and introduced himself. Chef's passion about the food he served was very aware with every bite I took. Luckily he reminded us not too eat too much bread. This dinner was one of the best Highlights of my trip to Vegas.   Thank you Jose, Chef Mike, and the rest of the crew!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! We didn't do a very good job planning dinners during CES but the Fresco was very accommodating and made us feel special. Elgin (the bartender) really knows his wine and Vanessa made us laugh the whole night. What a pleasant break from the madness. And if I didn't mention, food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Today I update my review by adding one more star for character.    One of the young ladies I referenced in my initial review was thoughtful enough to reach out to me and apologize for the service we received.  She acknowledged things could have been better.    Many times folks don't come back and apologize after reading a negative review.  I appreciate that she did that, it shows character."}
{"text":"I ate here w a friend after we worked all day and we were really excited to have Italian food. I have spent a lot of time in Italy and so has my friend (she is married to an Italian) and we all know standards of good food. We ordered two appetizers: fried mozzarella and a chop salad. The mozzarella was not warm, not fully cooked and the marinara was watery and lacking flavor. The chop salad was just chopped iceburg lettuce with overly tossed vinegary Italian dressing...with only one piece of arugula and a tiny piece of radicchio. It was bland. But we were still hopeful and politely excused their preparations, looking forward to our main courses.   I order chicken parm and my friend ordered linguine with clams. The first bite of my chicken parm made my stomach hurt, which was strange as I eat and make chicken parm all of the time. I had my friend try it and she said it was probably from the super thick soggy breading that wasn't cooked through on the over cooked piece of chicken. The spaghetti noodles were all over cooked and broken and the sauce was not flavored, watery (again) and just really not up to standards for the price is cost. How can they charge full price and cut corners on product by extending its use by diluting it?!  My friend's review of the linguini and clams were that her noodles were also morosely overcooked to the point of breaking into tiny pieces as the forked searched for a place to lift the soggy pile. The creamy (what?) sauce had no essence of clam juice nor any flavor of any sort ... creamy water has never been on anyone's list of being palatable especially involving seafood. She really tried to give the clams a chance proclaiming \"at least there is no sand.\" But as her chewing continued on and on she she said \"I can't. I have to send this dish back.\"   When I tasted the linguine she was right, it was also over cooked and completely broken. No Long noodles, they were all one inch. The clams were over cooked and inedible . The sauce was just cooked wine with no flavor at all. We sent both meals back.  We told the waitress (who was very helpful and kind) of our issue and she brought the manager (Dora?) who tried to intimidate us by bringing over a chef who seemed confused why she was even there. We politely and discreetly as possible told her how terrible the food was and that we could not consume it. (Serious warning this is the type of place you would potentially become ill). The manager then tried to tell us that egg based noodles just cook that way and that we should understand since she is Italian. (How could she be making such a disgrace of her wonderful culture). I spent years traveling back and forth from Tuscany and never have I had such terrible noodles. I definitely never had a meal make me sick as soon as I took a bite of it. After arguing with her for a few minutes and her acting condescending towards us, the manager said she would fix it and walked away. We sat for half an hour with the plates of food still piled cold in front of us and no one returning to our table.  Finally the server asked what was going on and we shrugged our shoulders and she returned with our bill charging us for everything, full price!! We said the manager mentioned \"taking care of it.\" Off she went leaving us for even longer. We never saw the manager again but it certainly became a big deal for the server leaving service to the kitchen to negotiate on our behalf.   When we were about to leave a generous 25% tip for her original patience and kindness on the table and just leave, the waitress returned with only one entree removed from the bill which we swiftly and  reluctantly paid. It was such an awful experience minus the waitress, she was great. But the food was absolutely awful and the manager does not know customer service at all."}
{"text":"You definitely need to eat here when you're in Vegas. The chicken marsala is to die for and the pasta carbonara was some of the best I've ever had. Great service and great food from Chef Mike."}
{"text":"We had great service and food 2 nights in a row. Chicken Marsala and the Branzino were wonderful and huge portions"}
{"text":"Thoroughly unimpressed.  First, I didn't see it mentioned anywhere but, this restaurant is in the Westgate hotel. I ordered the Caesar salad, my husband had the Italian sausage flatbread,and my daughter had linguine carbonara.  We all agreed our food was really bland.  Portion size was fine but, nothing had any flavor.  My Caesar salad was so fishy tasting, it was off putting.  I've had real Caesar salad with anchovies many times - you aren't really supposed to taste the fish, it should be an underlying flavor.  The headless raw anchovies laying on top didn't help either.  Way too expensive for the bland tasteless food."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, food was great but best of all the service was impeccable. Pete was our server and made us feel like we where home away from home. I definitely would come back just because Pete engaged with us as if we where his friends."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to eat light. We ordered a caesar salad, prosciutto-arugula flatbread and wild mushroom ravioli in a light creamy sauce. The flavors of the primary ingredients were lost in what appeared to me modernization or Americanization of these classic dishes. The melted cheese and balsamic on the flatbread overpowered the prosciutto. The olives in the ravioli sauce overpowered the wild mushrooms. The service was very good. We should have stuck with the caesar and Barolo."}
{"text":"Oh boy where do I begin....My sister made reservation here for a party of 7 ahead of time and they gave her such a hard time a few hours before. They called and asked if we were going to show up on time and that they could only sit 5 people (with). Anyways a friend of hers who works at the hotel got it fix for us and made the reservation for 9. We arrived and about ten minutes after we got seated. Our waitress name was Kimber. She greeted us , took our drink order and then a few minutes later came back to take our food order. First thing to come out were our two calamari appetizers, very delicious. Cannot say anything bad about that. Our entree's arrived and the portions were a good size. I had their spicy shrimp pasta sorry forgot what it was called, ugh so disappointed. Yes there was a little spice in it but over all super lack of flavor and let me just say I do not cook with salt. I had to add a lot of black pepper and some salt to it to make it edible. Not to mentioned I asked our waitress for some extra parmesan cheese. The pasta was very undercook and just was not good at all. My sister had the angel hair pasta with a white sauce and she enjoyed it very much. My cousin had the lasagna and she said it was delicious. My mother had their Fettucini Alfredo and she hated it. She said it was not good and lacked flavor. Same with the spaghetti and meatballs. Then to top it off, our server placed olive oil and vinegar in plates for our complimentary bread that we never received. We asked for it twice and for what ever reason we never got it. Our waters were room temperature and never got refills. Then our waitress brought my sister a piece of cake for her birthday and she just placed it on the table and said \"Happy Birthday\" then walked away. Not a  1,2,3 Happy Birthday lets sing or hey everyone lets all greet her.. nope Nothing, Over all I will never be coming back to this place especially not for the price. My bill for 1 glass of wine, 1 flat bread pizza and my pasta came out to $65. I do not care how much food cost, but as long as I enjoy it. Sucks I have to write this as I see a lot of potential in this place."}
{"text":"The food= to die for! You HAVE to order the 4 cheese agnolotti!  Chef Mike and his team were incredible!!!"}
{"text":"Holy delicious...  roll me out of here!  Someone rub my tummy and tell me everything is going to be ok.  EVERYTHING was so delicious I ate it all (too much, but so worth it)!!  Chef Mike is everythingggggggg! Highly recommend Montepulciano d'Abruzzo dal Tralcetro for red wine..  so good.  Also the clams and muscles with tomato 'nduja!"}
{"text":"Fresco Italiano is perfect for fresh authentic Italian food.  Very relaxing atmosphere and it smells like heaven! Their bread was pretty good and comes with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. Awesome combination!   We had the bruschetta for an appetizer and it was very tasty. We got there early so our food came out fast. We had fettuccini Alfredo, shrimp scampi, and some kind of fish. I can't remember what the fish was called. But let me tell you about that fish, it was huge, like the size of a shark! It was so perfectly prepared and cooked, I would definitely order it again. I did not taste the fettuccine Alfredo because I am not a fan of cream sauce, but the kids and my mom enjoyed it. My shrimp scampi was amazing. It came with angel hair pasta and some prawns as well. The prawns were so sweet and went perfectly with the dish.   One thing that amazed me about this place was that they make their own pasta! It was so buttery smooth and wasn't all stuck together like most places.   As a lover of Italian food, I highly recommend this restaurant, whether you are local or just visiting."}
{"text":"Horrible. Went in for dinner. We had 100 rooms at the hotel for my company. They told us no tables and no reservations. Went on Open Table and they said those don't count. Not doing that again!"}
{"text":"Came to vegas for the weekend. Fresco Italiano was recommended to me by friends who had previously eaten here. Their recommendation did not disappoint. I had the chicken  salad and the chicken parmesan. Service and food were on point. Completely forgot to.take a picture of the chicken parmesan but did take one of the salad. I highly recommend Fresco Italiano you will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Jose was very helpful and a great server towards us. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food and service. Pete, our waiter was fantastic!  We had a nice bottle of wine,  salad, antipasto appetizers and lasagna.  The portions were large enough for my husband and I to share everything. I would highly recommend this restaurant and the great service from Pete!"}
{"text":"Oh dear. Hate writing a downgrade because anyone can have an off night, but my last couple of visits were pretty disappointing.  Went with a group just before Christmas and the usually pleasant atmosphere was very lacking in energy. Got a waitress who was efficient enough but not in the least bit cheerful. (Maybe we're just spoiled by Pete and Joe).   When we requested bread, we were informed by Lady Stoneface that they were out of the complimentary bread but that garlic bread was available for an additional charge.  Oh, no! At that point the garlic bread should have become complimentary. Don't know whether to pin that on her or management, but shame on somebody for lack of customer service. Still, overall the food was pretty good.  So, we returned last week, and this time got Pete so service was good again, but I don't know who was manning the kitchen. It had to be someone either really cheap or really skinny, because the portion sizes were about half of normal. They used to serve big, juicy chicken breasts but these were more like fingers with a wing attached. And what happened to  the eggplant parmesan? The FDA requirements for listing ingredients by volume would have required this dish to be renamed \"Wedge of Baked Polenta with a Skimpy Eggplant Filling- and don't expect any cheese!\"  Yikes!   How did it all go so wrong so quickly? Three stars because Pete is great and I think the food tasted ok but there was so little it was hard to judge. Back to the Bootlegger."}
{"text":"This little Italian heaven is worth it, it is a little pricey but well worth it. Service is so friendly and nice makes you feel comfortable. The decor can be for a romantic time or nice dinner night. Food was incredible and delicious. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim as we were staying at the hotel and had a long day exhibiting at a trade show. We were pleasantly surprised by the relaxed atmosphere and warm welcome. Angelo was an excellent server and offered great suggestions. Our order of calamari was huge and delicious. The angel hair carbonara was excellent as well as the veal Milanese. We topped the meal off with Italian cheesecake. So delicious. Highly recommend This place if you want a quality meal at the Westgate!"}
{"text":"Overcooked and dry food. We should have known better when we saw all the other restaurants had lines but this one."}
{"text":"5 stars for our server Michael B. Food also was delicious but the service was what is going to make me come back.   Late night munchies. Everywhere was closed until we came upon Freacos..only to find out they too were about to close. Party of 7 and 15 minutes before closing time. We were going to leave because we arrived right before they were going to close and you know nobody wants to take a table right as they're closing, but Michael gladly took us, even with our hesitation! Not only that he was one of the BEST servers I've had.  Food was good, but very small selection. Half of the table got the same thing(chicken fettuccine) which was awesome so delicious. Will deff be visiting agian.  ASK FOR MICHAEL HES GREAT!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner there before soundtrack show at Westgate. Chopped salad, lasagna, house merlot and cheesecake. Great server too."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow  We had a late dinner at Fresco Italiano and it was superb! Some friends from Austin recommended it, and I'm so glad. The server was super nice, and she got us started with champagne and apps. Then we met Chef Michael McNeilly, and he asked us questions and made recommendations and we said yes yes yes. This was the best meal I've ever had in Vegas! And not crazy expensive! I'd recommend this place to anyone, and I'll go back for sure :)"}
{"text":"It was a disappointing. The server was really hyping the food. My wife ordered a carbonara and had spaghetti that was bundled up stuck together the size of large egg. We did an Open Table reservation that was canceled after we checked in resulting in not getting any open table points."}
{"text":"Deserves zero stars. How does any respectable italian restaurant charge $28 bucks for a plate of spaghetti and not inlude a slice of garlic bread. Save yourself, i left most of it on my plate"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a friend. The atmosphere was nice, food was great, but by far the best thing from the night was our waiter. He went above and beyond anything we could have imagined. Michael Baker, thank you for making our dinner memorable. Seriously won't ever forget him. I'd go back and make sure to have him be my waiter again!"}
{"text":"We walked up the hostess desk at about 8 pm with two for dinner.  We didn't have reservations but we saw that were lots of empty tables so we requested a table.  We were told it would be a twenty minute wait.  Ok that's fine.  I asked if we could sit at the bar and have a drink while we waited.  The hostess had to go ask someone.  She came back and told us no.  Even though there were only 2 people sitting at the bar and there were lots of empty chairs, we were told that they needed time to catch up from being busy earlier.  She had to do what she was told.  We asked to speak to a manager and there was no manager on duty.  We were finally seated and there were several empty tables that sat empty the entire time we were there.  The olive bread was dry, at least a day old.  The butter was rancid.  The vinegar and oil carafes were filthy.  I had to wipe my hand with a napkin it was so dirty from touching them.  I wish I had brought my phone  to take a picture.  My hopes weren't too high for the food that was yet to come.  My pasta carbonara was actually very good but the $26 plate of spaghetti bolognese was just ok.  Not great.  All in all, a negative experience and a waste of money.  Just like all my experiences at this hotel."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant old school Las Vegas just one problem and that is it depends on who's cooking to tell u how good it is. If they rite chef is cooking it's great but if he isn't it's very average"}
{"text":"Pretty sure I was refused service. Had to run to my room because there was a rip in my pants. Left the table, changed clothes, came back down and they said they were closed. Website said they close at 10pm and I was there at 8:30pm. Not cool!"}
{"text":"Dined on Angel hair pasta and Bolognese Fresco at the bar. The $18 spaghetti dish was just ok. The pasta was delicious; however, the meat while plentiful tasted dry and there was very little sauce.  Fresh shaved Parmesan cheese was provided for the pasta.   The bread was crumbly and dry too.   Service was friendly and attentive. That's why I rated it two rather than one star.   It's unlikely I'll return, too many great Italian restaurants in Las Vegas to revisit Fresco Italians."}
{"text":"I got the spaghetti thinking it would be good and I was terribly wrong. All it was, was meat and noodles that weren't even cooked all the way. Had no flavor at all and cost me 26 dollars."}
{"text":"I went with a friend to Fresco prior to a show at the Westgate.  We had a reservation for 6 PM and were seated immediately in a very quiet, mostly empty restaurant.  Ta'tiana, our server, came to the table and asked about drinks.  They were brought quickly and we ordered frito misto for a starter while we looked over the menu.  As it turned out, we both ordered the agnolotti.  The menu described it as having pistachio butter, garlic, and arugula.    The firto misto was good but I would have liked it cooked a bit more to a more brown exterior than the lightly fried we got.  The agnolotti was very good.  The texture of the pistachip pieces with the soft agnolotti was a wonderful contrast and it was a really good dish.  For dessert, my dining partner got the Elvis gelato--banana, peanut butter flavors.  I tried a bit and got a good peanut butter taste.  For me, I got the cannoli which are house made.  The shells were very thick and hard, but the ricotta filling and the diced, candied orange were very good.  One was dipped in coconut, the other in chocolate chips.  Service was very good.  Drinks were refilled.  This is almost a 4 star place."}
{"text":"Was in town for a training and a group of us found this little gem! Not only is the food and wine fantastic, the service from Michael Baker was outstanding!!! Micheal was amazing, fun, dealt with our snarky sense of humors with his own (which is always my favorite). He even serenaded us!! We ate flatbread, bruschetta, fettuccine, two different kinds of mussels and garlic bread. Mussels were fabulous. Pasta was a tiny bit bland but I love big flavors with lots of spice so that could be me. I didn't try the rest but my group shared they loved it. Reasonable prices. Well worth it!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a light snack after massages in Westgate's Serenity Spa.  We rec'd delicious olive bread while we waited for Cameron to bring our snacks.  He was a hoot and took great care of us.  Ordered one of the flat breads that was delicious, and then split an order of Alfredo on Angel Hair, the alfredo was out of this world!  Would have given it 5 stars, but these two items and iced teas ran us $50, which seems excessive for a restaurant listed as $$ here on Yelp."}
{"text":"We went to this place expecting much better food from this place. The waiter was very sweet and happy to give us another plate of food. The service was very slow and took nearly an hour. Angel hair with bolognese was dry and squishy. But the waiter was very sweet and brought me a pepperoni flat bread. It was very good and crispy."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great portion sizes. The prices are decent for vegas... there's an appetizer that comes with pasta, clams, and procciuto (sp?) that could stand alone as a meal itself and is only $12!! The bread is super fresh and tasty. The service is okay just a bit slow. Good food though will get me back in here... oh did I mention, no wait!! Two thumbs up for sure!"}
{"text":"This place screams great Italian from the bread and oil on the table to the hardy, pasta dishes! My personal favorite was the unique pear filled purses and vodka cream sauce.... loveeeee. Chef Mike makes it his personal venture that you are pleased at this restaurant... which proves in his meat and cheese board... always something different! It's a must!"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of celebrating our 22nd wedding anniversary at Fresco Italiano and we're truly blessed to have met the best server ever, Michael W. Baker and the entire staff provided us with extraordinary service! We'd give them 10 stars if we could. We strongly recommend if your in Vegas....go visit Michael and the Fresco Italiano family."}
{"text":"Great Italian food! The portions are generous, the food is delicious, and the prices are reasonable. The ambience is great - you forget you are next to a noisy, smoke-filled casino.   We were lucky to have Pete as our server. He was very attentive and went out of his way to make the dining experience as wonderful as possible. Ask for his table! He will take care of you.   We had the chicken piccata and the chicken rustica. Ample portions are served. The Caesar salad is served with real anchovies."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and were amazingly surprised. Our server Jose G. gave us a spectacular dinner and knew the menu like the back of his hands with the best wine suggestions, and dessert options. He made a caramelized banana dessert that was cooked and prepared right in front of us. Overall an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Not only was the food I had absolutely fantastic but what really made the trip special was our waiter Pete, he made sure we had absolutely everything we needed, was amazingly friendly, and especially quick!"}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I were looking for a place to eat after a show we went to Saturday night we decided on frescos our server Pedro helped us navigate the menu I decided on the ribeye my girlfriend got the fra diavolo and everything turned out wonderful great server great ambiance we will be back"}
{"text":"So my business associate and I, travel-weary, figured this place would be as good as any since it was in our hotel. And Italian is pretty hard to mess up, right? Plenty of tables when we arrived. Waiter was prompt and polite. Food arrived relatively quickly. Calamari was hot and seasoned well, but overcooked and rubbery. My associate ordered chicken parmesan and I had a different chicken dish I can't remember the name of, but involved potatoes and asparagus. My associate said his spaghetti was cold. He put his finger in it to show me. We sent it back. My chicken was exceptionally dry and potatoes were seasoned well but undercooked. At least mine came out hot. At $27 per chicken entree, you would think it would be somewhat edible. My advice is to skip Fresco and go next door to Edge Steakhouse where the food is exceptional and the staff amazing."}
{"text":"I was a member of a large group (12 people). The waiter (Carlos) was very attentive to everybody and very prompt. I had the Bone-In Veal Marsala. This came over angel hair pasta. It was in Carlos' words, \"Mmmm Sweet Baby Jesus\". The veal was very tender and was a very large portion. The Marsala sauce was very flavorful. Others near me had Lasagna, which looked to be about 10 layers thick. Another had the pork chops with a spicy marinara sauce. This also looked very appetizing. Everybody was pleased with their meals. I think it was on the pricey side of things, but I was not paying the bill so it didn't matter to me. This place is hidden inside the Westgate Resort ( the old LVH) near the convention center."}
{"text":"The service was poor. It wasn't to busy in the restaurant and it took nearly 40 minutes to get our chicken after we ordered it. To make up for the delay the manager gave a free glass of wine, stated a lot of people were ordering the same thing, and basically creating excuses. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm still sitting at the table with my wife after sampling the sausage & peppers, calamari, made to order minestrone and a basket of various fresh artisan breads. Everything was incredible! The marinara sauce is a chunky, rich, robust Tuscan style that I couldn't stop eating even though I was full. I tried their meatballs even though I had no space left but it was worth it! This place serves good size portions perfect for warm, family style dining. I wish I had invited more people to join us for dinner so we could try a few of their pastas but that will have to wait until next time... Don't miss this place. Arrive hungry, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you want the best sugar free lemon drop in the world, come here and ask for Tyler!  The food and service is beyond amazing as well!!!!"}
{"text":"Pete was great!  Ask for him. The food was fine but be prepared to pay. I had the chicken rustico."}
{"text":"Hmmmm... I wanted to like this place. It's new and I saw the reviews of others and was excited.   Service was good as could be given the number of patrons versus service staff.   The free bread was ok. It was mealy with olives in it. The bread was a bit hard and didn't taste fresh though...  I got the spicy sauce with meatballs and hubs got the chicken parmesan. We split our plates which was nice given the portions were fairly generous but a bit pricey.  I liked the kick the sauce had and liked the meatballs. The chicken Parm was thick and hearty.   Others in our party was unimpressed with the marinara sauce saying it had no flavor whatsoever. Someone had the soup and said that also lacked flavor.   Three stars for the price versus the flavor of the dishes. Also, they don't like splitting checks for you which always baffles me..."}
{"text":"Bummer.  Huge mistake ordering a ribeye from an Italian place.  $57 for an over cooked, super thin, gristly piece of meat.  I was with a large group of people and didn't want to make a scene so I didn't ask for another one.  I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was very nice, our waiter was fantastic, portion of food was small for the price. We had just arrived in Vegas and we were hungry so we tried this place."}
{"text":"We waited at least an hour before we were served, and the server wasn't all \"that\", and a poor comedian, to boot. The food wasn't very good, and the wine that was recommended smelled like rotten plums. You could drink it if you held your breath. All for $400. We didn't have a giant party, 10 people, but it was kinda pricey for less than average food and service."}
{"text":"Came to Fresco for dinner. I have to say, what an outstanding place. Staff was full of energy and very catering to guests. Chef Michael McNeilly does an outstanding job with the italian cuisine. Appetizers were very tasty and the main course made you feel like you were in Italy. Would highly recommend Fresco Italiano for anyone looking for great Italian food."}
{"text":"Service was slow. The food was ok, tought the portions were small. We ordered the spaghetti carbonara,  pastas seemed a little uncooked.  Wouldn't recommend. Does not worth the price."}
{"text":"the absolute worst garbage imaginable, served by obnoxious and disinterested staff, who are managed by arrogant, fake little italian men. avoid at all costs. my bolognese contained no tomato marinara, overcooked dog meat masquerading as beef, and zero pancetta, despite the menu's claim that it was authentic. and it was cold. yuk."}
{"text":"Pass. Over priced and under delivers. It's a miss across the board. Was at Westgate for an event and  ended up here at 9:15. Hostess was lovely. The food is average the cost is high. Nothing to inspire a return visit. Overall everything seems pre done. Nothing made to order. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Great dinner with my wife and friends. Excellent options and very well priced. Thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers as well as an entree I normally would not have tried.   The service could have been a bit better and more attentive, but for the most part this dinner was on point. Ambiance was extraordinary."}
{"text":"I would say for what we paid, that was one of the worst meals I have ever had. Split the tortallini and chicken parm with my boyfriend... and we were extremely underwhelmed. Our waiter asked if we wanted still or sparkling water, we got still (I will come back to this later). The best part of our meal was the garlic bread we did not order and specifically stated we wouldn't be having any bread. When we got the check the bill included a $4 garlic bread. The waiter apologized because he knew we didn't order the bread and said he would take it off. A minute later he had come back and the bill was even more expensive.. he had charged us $8 for the water (what is this, Italy?... I don't think so). He was nowhere to be found for 10 minutes so we decided to just give up and leave that disappointment of a restaurant. Completely unsatisfied with the food, lack of transparency, and overalls service."}
{"text":"The calamari was out of this world and whatever the green sauce is they give you with it is phenomenal. Chicken parm was meh... the way they serve it is more like fried chicken and I like a nice breast. Spinach and potatoes were subpar. Canoli was decent. The calamari and drinks save it a bit. Too many restaurants in Vegas to visit again."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here for the first time, and was considerably underwhelmed. First of all, our waitress was very nice but took our entree order before we even saw the wine list. We got our drinks halfway through dinner. I had to catch her attention about 3 times because she wasn't awesome about checking in with us. I saw other customers doing the same. I ordered the shrimp scampi, and it mostly tasted of raw onions and had only a few small shrimp. My boyfriend had the ravioli with a sauce that tasted like tomato soup. For $100, definitely not worth it. I'd say it's one step up from Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Expensive which was okay. The 6oz filet looked really small ($45 a la carte) My wife and I both ordered it. She said the same thing.   My wife commented to our server who was very nice. A few moments passed and a well dressed manager came over to see if everything was alright. My wife said, \"this isn't 6 oz!\" Which was direct, no doubt but in our life of having 6 oz filets while dining out, it was the smallest we have seen.   The manager replied, \"Did you weight it?\"  Ha, yeah we bring scales to dinner w us.   Anyway, server was great. Food was tasty. Steak would fit in a thimble. Not a fair value for the price, imo."}
{"text":"Best seafood risotto I had in a long time Alfredo.Sauce is on point and freshly made  Robert our server was on point"}
{"text":"Le restaurant est situ√© dans l'hotel westgate.  Le parking √† notre arriv√©e √©tait ouvert et gratuit. Vous devrez traverser l'hotel et le casino pour acc√®der au restaurant. La deco ne paye pas de mine. Simpliste mais efficace. Un petit resto italien au milieu de vegas.  Cot√© degustation c'est vraiment tr√©s bon. Nous avons pris en entr√©e les bruchetas de tomates et celles de chevre. Un vrai delice. En plat principal les spaghettis alfredo miam miam. Je n'ai pas pu finir tellement il y'en avait assez. Cot√© accueil nous avons √©t√© agreablement servie et avec le sourire."}
{"text":"Meatball sub sandwich was nothing more than two meatballs shoved into a dinner roll with a small dab of marinara. Sides advertised as roasted red potatoes, but I was warned by the bartender it's actually just potato chips. She also had to go retrieve my meal herself due to half the wait staff congregating beside the bar and gossiping about other patrons. The two girls behind the bar were very nice and attentive, but the food was pathetic and the overall experience was somehow worse. For $40 Olive Garden would have been better, but what can you expect from a hotel that manages to lose quality with each renovation. Pass on this place and the hotel it's in too."}
{"text":"Fresco Italiano?  √® magnifico!  Chef Mike McNeilly is a magician in the kitchen!  Him and his staff set to please!!  This was our first visit to Fresco Italiano and it WILL NOT be our last!  I've tried many an Italian restaurants in Vegas and this is tops!  We visited in April 2016 for our first time and let me tell you, it was fantastic!  I'm going to start with the atmosphere.  We sat in a private room, a separate room just off the main dining area.  The main dining area was clean, well lit and a nice open room with plenty of seating.  No complaints on the atmosphere.  Perfect for a romantic night out with the significant other or a great spot to take the family for an authentic Italian meal!  Our private room was the perfect setting for our night out.  Nice touch!!  For our meal, we started with the bruschetta and it was delicious!  Then we moved on to an appetizer of fried lobster.   OMG, goodness.  You cannot go wrong with these appetizers!  Then me and the wife split 2 main dishes, we had spaghetti and meatballs and a petit filet mignon.  Let me tell you, freshness at it's finest.  The filet was so soft you could cut it with a fork!  It was also served with a butter to top the steak, holy moly...WOW!  I know Chef Mike and his staff use only the finest ingredients, you could really taste the difference!   Overall an A+ experience.  We got a bottle of red wine to compliment our meal and I felt like it was priced perfectly.  Some of the reviews mention it's overpriced for what you get.  I'm calling shenanigans!  This is Vegas folks.  You get what you pay for.  You want to spend $20 for a steak, well, expect to get a $20 steak!  We ended up closing the restaurant as we were the last patrons in the establishment.  The restaurant was not too busy being it was a Tuesday night, so we even got paid a visit by the Executive Chef Mike!  He wanted to make sure our visit was up to the standards that he expects from his staff and rest assured, it EXCEEDED those expectations.  That was a nice touch!  The hostess was extremely pleasant, our server was there for our every need, and obviously the kitchen staff was phenomenal!  It's not so often you get paid a visit by the Executive Chef and it was a nice touch!  My recommendation, definitely pay it a visit!  You will not be disappointed!  Atmosphere = Great, Food = Great, Priced = Right!"}
{"text":"We were In town and decided to try it out , lots of good choices , vegetarian and gluten free choices . We ordered frutti de Mari and prosciutto and peas. Both pasta dishes , I preferred theFrutti de Mari best, seafood dish with just the right spice . Our appetizer was a meatball with the fettunta (toasted sourdough bread with garlic and geese . The meatball was very good, not over cooked cooked perfect.  Service was great and everyone friendly . Nice atmosphere too . Good for kids ok and they have a nice bar section too."}
{"text":"Was at the Westgate for Combat Con and one night decided to eat there.  The food was very good as was the service and atmosphere.  I would give it five stars alone for the manager who was working.  He helped pull off a hilarious prank on someone in our group (at another table) which was amazing!!!  Thank you for such a wonderful experience (that people will be talking about for years to come)!!!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a fast bite for lunch and ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  There are pictures all over the Casino of a great looking meatball dish and what we got was far from it. It looked and tasted like canned slop with dry dog food meatballs.  Literally we both decided it was the worst ever.  The table behind us had the same and was saying the same. The service was great and the hostess was fast and nice, just not at all worth $30.00 for the awful dish."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We had the chicken parm and the fettuccine alfredo  and shared both. The wine selection was great. I loved my cab and he had the chianti. We couldn't ask for more. Our waitress Mariah was super helpful with the menu and very attentive. Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Omg what more can I say! Not only was the good 5-Star but the service (Michael Baker) made the meal 3x better! The man is born to serve, entertain and simply make life better. We came from a funeral and his compassion and care came thru his personal service & Touch"}
{"text":"Jose G deserves a mega raise!!! It literally took a hour to get our food which was super frustrating, but Jose G kept us entertained.  Thank you Jose."}
{"text":"The customer service by Pete was excellent.  I highly recommend this place.  the food is delicious and Pete made the experience awesome!!"}
{"text":"Mariah - wow!  Exceptional food!!!!  Thereafter food... Bottomline - perfection if you want Italian!!!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst restaurant in the Westgate Hotel & Casino. Please save your time and money and go somewhere else where the food is actually good and the service is decent. The waitress we had was unbelievably rude and continuously ignored our request (mind you, we only asked for simple things like straws & oil/vinegar for our bread). I'm sure I know the reason for this horrendous service and while I try not to go there often, it was undoubtedly clear. I'm furious leaving this place and will make sure to recommended to everyone I know to STAY AWAY from this place."}
{"text":"I will preface this post with the fact that living in NY, I have a very low tolerance for what is acceptable Italian fare.   The atmosphere is casual, fun, and fresh.   He staff was VERY courteous and some of the best mixologists around. They make a mean old fashioned.  The food: Bland. No other word can accurately describe my meal. Under the recommendation of the bartender, I ordered the Chicken Burrata. The service was lackadaisical but he drink was rest, so I didn't mind.   When my fish arrived, it looked tasty. Lightly breaded, crispy, and served on a fresh tomato sauce with Burrata sandwiches in between. Looked good. The flavor however was seriously lacking salt, depth, and desire to eat more. After two -three bites, I couldn't finish.   Normally, I do not send back dishes, but for hr price, I said something and they graciously removed it from my bill.   I may give it another try solely based on the wait staff and he atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so far below the standards we have come to expect from Las Vegas restaurants. For starters we were made to wait for a table and the hostess forgot to come get us and seated others instead. We had to go and remind her we were still waiting. Bread was brought to our table with no plates or oil/balsamic. We had to go take it from another table nearby. Our appetizer came out late, cold, and clearly a previously frozen item as water squirted out when we cut into it (fried mozzarella) The agnolotti in browned pecan butter with arugula was also cold in the middle and the browned butter was a pool of cold, sort of a lemon flavoured pasta water. Gross. The server did not check on us after serving the entrees, didn't offer pepper or Parmesan like he had with the other tables. The waiter came with the bill before we were finished eating, leaving it on the back of the bench behind my husbands head where we were sitting, not even on the table. No offer of coffee or dessert.  The only reason for the generous 2 star rating was that the chicken parm was done well and the server took the agnolotti off the bill as it was returned to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm m rooting for this place. I feel like they're trying. But they have some things to work out. We made a reservation but when we arrived realized we didn't actually need one, because for a Saturday night, it wasn't busy at all. We were greeted by a very nice waiter (who later disappeared and was replaced by a series of wait staff and manager...?). We ordered the classic Bruschetta, my daughter the Risotto (she's 12, never had it so had questions which our waiter kindly answered). My husband had The Filet and I just wanted wanted a simple salad and minestrone soup. They didn't have minestrone so they offered a creamy potato instead. The bruschetta was delicious! Once again the 12year old had never had it. She loooved it and managed to have two servings, along with the bread they brought to the table. OK here's what I wasn't impressed with...I didn't want wine to start with and asked to leave the drink list. They took it away along with some dishes and never again asked if I wanted a drink (I had water). The salad was huge, and looked fresh but I couldn't eat it. It was drowning in balsamic vinegar. I love balsamic vinegar, and dressing in general, but this was too much. They took it away (by this point our waiter was gone) but never apologized. They weren't rude, just never acknowledged the salad issue. My husband thought his filet was incredible, and my daughter found a new dish to order by enjoying the risotto. My potato soup, in a beautiful Italian designed bowl, was very good and not too heavy. We ordered the cannoli for dessert. They were good, not great. Shells were too thick to bite into with braces. I think 3 people came to the table to ask how things were. I didn't know who was the waiter, manager, what happened to our waiter. It was confusing. So all in all, food that was good was VERY good. Some things were inconsistent. I hope they can improve on those things and make it all work."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place four stars because the food was good, but the service was SHITTY! It was beyond crap.  We came here for dinner with friends. We saw great marketing for this place. We wanted to give it a try. The night was disappointing because we ordered a caprese salad to find out there's no mozarella in the salad.   We asked for draft beer. They apparently have a list of draft beer... But don't serve it.  We ordered our food. It was amazing. It definitely made up for the service we received from the waitress, who was rude and not at all attentive.   The seafood risotto is by far, the best I ever tasted. Their handmade pasta noodles is perfect. Their penne Bolognese is good, as well as their lasagna.   When it came to ordering dessert, I ordered a dinner special where it was $19.99 for pasta and gelato. I wanted the hazelnut. I was disappointed to hear I got only one option for gelato. That was not made clear on the advertisement. When we asked the waitress, she argued with us telling us we were wrong and just didn't read the menu and advertisement correctly. We were fine and decided to offer an advice of make it known that the special is for one flavor of gelato. She said yes it was clear and we just didn't see it.   We also said mention on the menu that it is one scoop of gelato rather than the normal three scoop portion. She told us it is all on the menu and we just didn't see it. At that point, we got frustrated because we were telling her what we saw and interpreted from their ad. If seven adults got it wrong, then there must be something wrong with the wording or wasn't clear. We were offering our advice of what wasn't made clear.   She actually RAISED her voice at us and told us it was clear and there's nothing wrong with the menu. She said it clearly read house gelato and they reserve the right to pick what it was. That's fine... Just make it clear on the menu. She fought with us all.  She finally conceded and said in a very condescending tone, \"You know, you're right. The customer is always right.\" We went and complained to the manager because we were so irritated with her, her lack of service, her lack of professionalism, and lack of manners. He was apologetic and comped us which was nice but not needed.   We will happily go back to Fresco Italiano for the food. We will not go back until they fix their wait staff or at least get rid of that one waitress."}
{"text":"Our family of 8 celebrated my parents 67th anniversary last night at Fresco Italiano and it was outstanding!! The ambiance and decor were charming, then our waitress, Danyella  Patrizio, was just so perfect that she made this our favorite restaurant!! She gave great advice on what to order, found the perfect prosecco, for our picky anniversary gal, then secretly had the chef prepare a gorgeous display of desserts which were complimentary as an anniversary gift. The food is truly unique and special and not found at other Italian restaurants. The Marsala sauce is the very best I've ever tasted. Then she had a fellow waiter , Micheal, with a voice like an angel, come over and make a lovely speech then Sing an Italian opera song in their honor. What a gift to us and every lucky patron in this restaurant. Thank you for the most memorable evening we could have Ever hoped for. Love this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and staff! So friendly and accommodating. The food is amazing! And the drinks are great!! Always my first and last stop when I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"From the hostess to the food, the restaurant was mediocre at best. Overpriced and the worst Fettuccine Alfredo I've ever had. I would never go back and would steer anyone away from it. There are plenty of high-quality Italian restaurants in Las Vegas offering better food and service."}
{"text":"The olive bread was dry and nasty . The vinegarette dressing was very potent. We order the spaghetti and meatball 26 and the 22oz prime rib eye steak 57. The food was pricey the side were small portions. I don't think I would eat here again, there are many other places in the city that give good portion for the entree and sides."}
