{"text":"Food is greasy and uninspired. They claim to have a great fish fry but it's average at best. Got there at 6:25 pm on a Friday and told there was an hour and a half wait, while there were a ton of empty tables. Wait staff is marginal at best. They do have a great beer selection. But as a restaurant 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"This place is great.  We went  for the fish fry.  There are several choices, cod, walleye,  etc. all saying freshly caught.  You get battered fries (awesome) and slaw (has fresh cut onions in it).  Also had the Friday clam chowder and the special corn chowder.  Both were to-die-for!  The beer selection is amazing.  You won't be disappointed.  The crowd is very diverse and dinner time is busy."}
{"text":"We drove 45 minutes through rain and rush hour darkness to get here, but were not disappointed. Service was fast and we had two great beers and our soup before we knew it. One of the best beer lists in town too! Great homemade chips and french onion dip and a locally made pretzel with great dips came next. Smelt fry was great! Very lightly breaded as advertised (nothing like the pre breaded frozen kind) and great tartar sauce. Pizza had great thin crust. We would definitely come back again for many reasons."}
{"text":"Great craft beer menu. An unexpected gem. I ordered the Catfish po boy, it was grilled. There soups r homemade and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Dexter's Pub is a true Madison neighborhood joint. The beer list is extensive, mainly  composed of beers from Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota, and the specials revolve around burgers and fish fries. 

We started with a pitcher of beer and hummus made with Hopalicious beer and red peppers. The hummus was interesting - sharp, a little tangy, and a little gritty. It came with a generous amount of veggies and fried pita triangles (an interesting if not excellent touch) and I ate a good deal of it, mostly because I was hungry. The sourness was enough to make me wonder if it was off, but nobody else seemed concerned.

My friends ordered fish fries and a Tex Mex sandwich, and I had a chipotle black bean burger with chipotle aioli and caramelized red onions. The bun was thoroughly mediocre and I ditched it, but the patty was flavorful as were the aioli and onions. The garlic chile fries were pretty tasty, the waffle fries were standard cafeteria fare. 

We sat on on the back patio, watching sand volleyball and ducking errant balls. 

Pros: the beer, casual atmosphere, and garlic chile fries. 

Cons: confused servers, bad burger buns, smokers on the patio. 

I'd go back for a drink on the back patio, but I would probably eat at home first."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Easy to feel like a local. Unbelievable how much great food comes out of such a small kitchen. And the beers are always an attraction. Some of the best craft beers in the country on tap. Nick the owner has a great knack for putting some great beers on tap.  One of our favorites. You'll never be disappointed.  The wait is long on Friday nights for fish, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in on a recent Friday to try the fish fry based on reviews. Worried that would be waiting for a table, we went in hopeful. Got a booth right away for four and it was very busy. I had been in here pre-Sandlot days and wasn't impressed but this \"make-over\" is proving positive.

Key points:
 - waitress was great, offered tastes of beer to help my decision
 - perch and cod, both good and plenty of it
 - pub fries were great, not overcooked like so may places
 - echoing other compliments on the beer selection, nice
 - fine for the kids too, at least earlier around dinner time (5-7)

I'd come back to try non-fish fry some night."}
{"text":"I have been to Dexter's quite a few times now, usually for their specialty tappings or to watch a football game. 

Atmosphere - I would classify Dexter's as hole-in-the-wall hipster-esque classic Wisconsin bar. It will appeal to people who just want to go to a local pub and crack open a Hamm's. It will also appeal to people who want an unassuming space to quaff some delicious craft beer. It isn't fancy, but it is roomy. My one complaint is that it is always chilly. I usually keep my coat on or I freeze. 

Food - The food at Dexter's is pretty good. It is slightly amped up pub food. It is most certainly better than your standard pub fare. They have some yummy options for spicy, heart-clogging sandwiches that my husband loves. I like the Fajita salad and pulled pork sandwich. 

Beer -  Fantastic. This is real the reason to go to Dexters. They have rotating taps of featured beer. They are attentive to trends in craft brewing and will often have something that is new and difficult to find. Their bartenders are usually knowledgeable about the beer, and they know how to pour a hefeweizen correctly. It is not the best deal you will find in town, but they will also have pours other places don't get. 

Service - Also pretty good. I have no complaints about the staff here. They are attentive without being annoying. They also know what they are talking about which is refreshing. 

As a plus, in the warmer months, they have an outdoor space you can play volleyball. Or you can join their volleyball league."}
{"text":"When I lived in the neighborhood I went here a lot because it was convenient. Everything I've tried there has been A-OK. The dining room feels a little bit like a cafeteria, but whatever. Love their tap list with detailed descriptions."}
{"text":"We went to Dexter's on Friday for the fish fry at the start Craft Beer week.  So we knew the wait would be long.  It was about an hour or more wait to eat.  But that didn't matter because we got to have a couple of tasty beers.  Once we sat down to eat, we started off with the clam chowder.  I loved it.  The chunks of clam were huge and tender, not chewy.  The soup wasn't too thick that it overshadowed the clams, onions and potatoes.  We both ordered the deep fried cod.  One of the best we've had.  It came out hot and crispy.  The batter wasn't too oily and you could taste the flakey cod.  The waitress was very busy but always available if we needed anything.  I can't wait to eat there more.  

I love the atmosphere at Dexters.  It's a great mix of people who are friendly and there to enjoy the beer/food."}
{"text":"The food is good!  I particularly like the more unusual offerings, like the mozzarella rolls.  The pizza is only mediocre. The beer selection is wide and diverse, with an emphasis on Wisconsin brews.  It only gets really crowded for trivia nights (Tues and Wed 8-10) but other than that not too bad."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was looking for a place to have some beer and some good food and this place was excellent.  First of all, the waitress was very kind with great service and helpful advice for a couple \"newbies\".  The beer selection was great and we got a pitcher of a microbrew for $10, which I thought was a great price.  The burgers were huge and very tasty along with the cheesecurds and fries.  I will definitely visit this place again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Had a great 5 piece perch fish fry with yummy waffle fries.  Good food, neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"I don't live quiiiiite close enough for this to be MY neighborhood bar, but it meets all the requirements: laid-back atmosphere, great food, and seriouslygreatcraftbeerlist. Their beers are all of the cant-pick-up-at-the-gas-station variety and it's worth coming by just for that--the menu diversity is the cherry on top of my craft beer float."}
{"text":"We venture here often, as it's walking distance from our house. Fine fish fry and good other offerings. Really kid friendly before 7 (seriously, the dining area is almost like a day care sometimes), adult friendly after. Decent beer selection most of the time. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great beer selection, yet down to earth people. The best of both worlds. Plenty of other drink options if you're not a beer drinker."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place to get a delicious Reuben and brew fries in town! My favorite dive on the Eastside of Madison."}
{"text":"OVERRATED!!!  People are sheeple sometimes and I am taking a stand.  Sorry Dexter, but if you wanna get stars from me...you need customer service and good food.  One bad thing about yelp is it would be nice to rate the food and service separately, because this is one of those occasions that the food is a 4 or 5 and the service is a 0 or 1 and there is no 2.5 rating.  

i would suggest that having happy cows gets you happy cheese.  It was hard to find an employee smiling; except for in the kitchen.  The kitchen was filled with happy cooks and happy people made excellent food.  Dexter's is one of the only places in town that you can get blue gill for fish fry.  You do catch a bone here or there, but that's a small price to pay for something delicious.  The bartenders and waitstaff need to smile and be happy.  Granted the place is packed and things get hectic, but I guarantee the staff would benefit with more tips by making one adjustment :)  The female bartender griped and groaned so darn much, I wish we did wait the hour for a table, just so we wouldn't have to listen to her complain about working.  If you hate your job, get a new one, but don't complain and ruin a customer's experience with your poor attitude.  You took a job that makes drinks for people; I am sorry I asked which certain type of beer they had, because I had a menu dropped in front of me and a snotty remark.  How about you just tell me the 3 varieties you have and then you won't have to stare at me angrily while I fumble through the menu to then try and find the section for that type of beer.  

It seemed like the majority of the people in the place had eaten and were just sitting at their tables.  Most were not even ordering drinks anymore and they weren't really talking, so if there was some way to get people moving...more people can be sat and fed, because we did watch quite a few people being told an hour wait time and left.  If the hostess would see this as $$$$$ walking out the door, maybe more staff or just more attention to customers to get them moving in and out faster and not just waiting for bills and what not.  i know it is a small place and you can't force people to leave, but there are small things that can be tweaked that can get people moving faster and always smile, smile, smile!"}
{"text":"Had the gulf shrimp po boy for the first time. I knew Dexter's was great, but now I'm planning to go here every Friday I can! And the beer selection is incredible. Great place with friendly service"}
{"text":"Really is the best fish fry. Try their pretzel the stone mustard and cheese dipping sauces are a must!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Windy City ($12.99) to go for a late night snack after stopping for a pitcher. They had some really interesting microbrews on tap, some breweries that I've never heard of before (maybe a true connoisseur will have). I believe we ended up getting a Chipotle flavored porter, which was very full-bodied with a hint of smokiness.

I was happily impressed that they had a full menu at 11 pm!

The sandwich came piled high with thin slices of prime rib, hardly any fat, and served on a hearty, crusty french roll. We chose the giardinierra peppers to accompany the sandwich (you can choose sweet peppers as well). They gave us a generous container of au jus. The sandwich was probably a good 8 or 9 inches long. Very fitting of the price tag. The meat was grilled and flavorful, without resulting in a jerky texture. The au jus was light and much needed to soak the french roll down to the point where you could finally take a bite of this meatyness.

We chose the waffle fries as a side, which were fried and seasoned perfectly.

I'll definitely add this to my list of late night eats!"}
{"text":"This has easily become my go-to Friday fish fry.  I like it so much, I've been hesitant to even write this review.  Nonetheless, Dexter's does it right.

Fresh, Bering sea cod enveloped in a crispy, salty batter keeps me dreaming of Fridays.  The clam chowder is phenomenal and so are the rest of their soups...obviously lovingly tended to and cooked from homemade stocks.  I could further pontificate, but no need...the execution in the kitchen is stellar.  

Now, the beer list is exquisite in my opinion.  I love Madison, but many bars get so caught up on local-centric taps lists.  Consequently, more often than not, you walk in to see the taps jammed with Ale Ayslum, Lake Louie and Capital.  Not bad...but I'll be damned to say I could choke down another Hopalicious.  Dexters, on the other hand, opens their taps up to pretty much anything.  From Toppling Goliath (which I love, but you can't really get outside of Iowa and Wisco) to Belgian Flander's Reds, they kill it with their beer selection.  Also, I really respect that they let you know on the beer list what's on deck...this has kept me coming back many-a-times.  

So why not the 5-stars?  Well, we've run into some seriously long waits, both for a table and then for the fish.  If they could streamline a little more in the kitchen, I'd gladly give it that extra star.  In the mean time, we NEVER come here on Fridays after 6pm....forget it.  If you don't mind dining with the Greyhairs....you'll do just fine."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a drink after spending the day in downtown Madison. Dexter's is definitely a neighborhood joint, but the drinks and food are way above par. I would go out of my way to stop here even if I didn't live in the area. The beer menu is extensive and they usually have a few drafts on special. The food menu is your typical bar food but turned up a notch. You can tell the ingredients are real rather than frozen from a bag. 

We ordered the large old world pretzel, which comes with three sauces/mustards. We tried the stoneground, deuseldorf, honey mustard and beer cheese sauce. My favorite was the deuseldorf and stoneground, but I'm a mustard girl. 

Word on the street is that their Friday fish fry is out of this world, which I have yet to try, but it is on my bucket list."}
{"text":"Great sconnie place. Good place for a fish fry. Interesting beers on tap and a full bar."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for craft beers in Madison.  24 tap lines always have a varied selection of craft brews.  They host events regularly with tap takeovers or beer dinners.  This week is craft beer week and they have some of the best lineups of the week.  Even with being slammed the service is good.  The food is excellent.  The garlic-chili fries are a must.  My friend had the BBLT which is a BLT with brisket.  The brisket was more like pot roast, but that is perfectly fine for Wisconsin.  If you go there for Fish Fry, plan on waiting...its one of the best in Madison."}
{"text":"Best clam chowder I've ever had! My husband loves their chili and I believe all their soups are made from scratch and I've always been pleased.... We typically only go for Friday Fish Fry and are never disappointed, just be prepared for a long wait for both a table and the food but I believe it is worth it... great beer choices that change frequently and we were pleasantly surprised by their sandwiches as well. We went in on an off night (Monday) to watch a football game... We were seated right away and the game atmosphere was great with many televisions so you don't have to worry about where you are seated."}
{"text":"Went in to Dexters pub on a Friday night for the fish fry with my son, yes it was busy and I could not believe how relaxed the hostess, waitress and bartender's were, they had no stress or attitudes and you could tell that they enjoyed their jobs, this made the experience very pleasant.!All the people there  eating were equally as pleasant and the breaded cod and walleye, waffle fries and coleslaw were excellent!! Ya go there."}
{"text":"Hard time rating Dexter's today.

I ordered the soup and sandwich lunch combo. Grilled cheese and chili. Grilled cheese was great but the chili was over powered by the taste of cumin. It was still okay, but it almost was hard to taste the tomato in the chilli. Our service was prompt, and prices were fair which is why overall I give them a four star.

I would say it's a nice place in Madison for bar food, that is nicer than a dive, and also much easier to park than many Madison restaurants. 

I would eat here again, but it did not make my Madison favorites list."}
{"text":"Checked out Dexter's for a Friday fish fry and it was surprisingly awesome. Great atmosphere for a neighborhood bar. Unexpectedly diverse beer selection that's constantly rotating (had a great Lagunita's Hairy Eyeball). Fish was some of the best I've had in Madison. Ordered both the cod & walleye and both were delicious--thinly battered and fried perfectly without excess grease. Waffle & brew fries were delicious too. Amazingly, after over a thousand calories of deep fried food, I still didn't feel nasty. Thanks for helping me kinda stay catholic.

Special mention to their outstanding service. After someone stole our place in line, they apologized profusely and hit us up with a free spinach & artichoke dip appetizer. Very sweet."}
{"text":"We came on trivia night and there was quite a turnout, the food was delicious, and even with the crowd we had good service and a great atmosphere. This is a great bar with a neighborhood/everyone welcome feel. 
They take cards with a 10.00 minimum which is great, I think the reason it took me so long to get here was my belief that they were cash only. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Excellent, constantly rotating list of great tap beers, good consistent food, and a nice atmosphere. Not fancy but a great neighborhood bar. Tuesday night trivia is always fun and competitive."}
{"text":"Great service, great food plain and simple! Oh, and awesome beer selection that is always changing."}
{"text":"Visiting from Portland, came in here twice. Awesome selection and they have pitchers for everything. And cheese curds. 

Allie was super personable and shared so many awesome things about Madison. And knew a ton about local beer. Five stars easy."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, okay bloodies (little acidic), decent food (asked for M burger got W) and great Friday fish fry. Friendly neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"9/27/13 My wife and I stopped in for lunch.  Their catfish po'boy is even more awesome because their bread improved!  They have many great reasons to stop in, but if you haven't tried Central Waters Hop Rise Session Ale or Central Waters Satin Solstice Imperial Stout grab a seat and imbibe!"}
{"text":"Fantastic craft beer selection, really tasty and high quality food at a very reasonable price! Hard to beat on the east side.
Also a very friendly and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Was here for a short time after the Great Taste of the Midwest.  Outside the building it looks really old, but inside it's looks all new and remodeled.  Holy moly they have a lot of beer taps! When I was there they recently had a tap takeover of Toppling Goliath Brewing.  Most of the taps was from that brewery, and good thing I do like that brewery.  I'm guessing they have a wicked beer selection when there isn't a tap take over.  I didn't get a chance to eat here, but hopefully I'll come hungry my next visit down to Madison."}
{"text":"I usually hit this place because of their beer selections. they mix it up a lot and some time great some time not. Most of the time its great except for the tap take overs. You cannot win them all. Food is great also"}
{"text":"Wait, what? I haven't written an official review for Dexters? WTF. Dexters is my go-to, fave, best soups, my own \"Cheers\". I seriously love this place and the awesome folks who work there. Amazing food, beer selection, and I love their daily food/drink specials. They make their dressings and soups from scratch. I feel super lucky that Dexters is my neighborhood tavern!!!"}
{"text":"I take back what I said about the food being just \"okay\". Last time I was here I had a salmon salad that was incredible. So whatever complaints I had in 2010 no longer stand. I look forward to returning for another tasty meal."}
{"text":"I love their friday night fish fry . The price is right and great bluegil and perch. I have to keep going back there. love it! I defeintely recommend fish or even sandwiches, burger. Oh, don't forget their greasy chili gralic fries :)"}
{"text":"The food is great and the craft beers are even better. The staff is very friendly but I docked them two whole stars because the service is very untimely. You will often spend time waiting for what you want, and if you are in a large group prepare to be there a long time."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers!  I am gluten intolerant, so I sadly can't enjoy those anymore, but they have a good selection of good ciders too.  Sadly no gluten-free beers anymore, apparently the demand wasn't high enough.  Fun place to watch football."}
{"text":"I love Dexter's. It's a short walk away, so I go there a lot. I've been there dozens of times.

Their daily specials are usually what I check out, and they come with a cup of soup. And that soup is usually amazing. Their chili is always fantastic. Their fish fry is also very good. They have a beef brisket sandwich called the BBLT that is always really good.

They have plenty of beer on tap, and plenty of televisions for your viewing pleasure. The staff is always friendly and willing to recommend something."}
{"text":"Top notch beer selection. Pub chips and French onion are the bomb. Spicy pork sandwich is so spicy it should come with a warning! It's delicious, though. All-in-all, a great place to grab a bite and a beer. And you can always check the tap list on the DigitalPour app before you arrive!"}
{"text":"My first time to Dexter's and I would stay away.  Confused and rude staff combined with a dead mouse on the back patio as we first walked in.   We came for the Toppling Goliath tap take over and it was the most unorganized event I have ever been to!"}
{"text":"Lot's of things going right for this place, as long as you get there at the right time. Great selection of micro brews. Interesting and delicious food. The last time I went in for food and a beer it was lovely. However on previous occasions, I was freezing in winter, or deafened on trivia night. I hope they get a better announcer and a better PA system so customers don't have to suffer through the distortion."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great staff.  Amanda B. is an exceptional server."}
{"text":"I enjoy Dexters for several reasons. It is close to my house, service has always been really good and prices are reasonable. 
I love the burgers, the chili fries, the waffle fries, the specials and, well, everything. Great soups, too!
Check it out'"}
{"text":"After tough experiences at Bear and Bottle and Ale Asylum, I've come to appreciate how well Dexters does food, and that their prices are very reasonable. When we need to watch a Packer or Brewer game, this is our go to location. They also have a good trivia night.  Awesome beer selection."}
{"text":"I have been going to Dexter's for years and I have been a little disappointed lately.  The last time I went the service was ok.  They were not busy by any stretch of the imagination.  The server allowed our drinks to go empty before taking our order.  My pizza had clearly sat under the lights for several minutes before it got to me.  She gave us our checks while we were still eating.  The whole situation soured my experience.  I felt as though I should have apologized for inconveniencing her."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to stop here for some time now after hearing about thier craft beer selection.  We finally had the opportunity to stop, but we left a little dissapointed.  They clearly have a good selection of craft beers.  I think there was about 20 on tap.  Several more in bottles and cans.  The food was just ok.  I felt like my sandwich was pretty good with the spicy chili fries.  My wifes shrimp wrap, however had a hair in it and so she lost her appitite.  This ruined her entire visit! Things happen, just sucks it was on our first time coming here.  
Place is older, run down dining decor, ripped booth cushions, and just needs a little remodeling to be a great place."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and always have great food and service.  We were here on a Monday night a couple of weeks ago and had the best southwest burger!  Our server was friendly and shared her knowledge of the menu.  She actually provided SERVICE, not just going through the motions.  I like coming here for that reason.  It's a great local place with good food."}
{"text":"I've been to Dexter's fish fry on multiple occasions. Their basic beer battered cod is among the best you'll find. The perch is multiple small portions of fish. It's good but not great. I can't speak for the walleye or shrimp because I always get the beer battered cod- it's that good!

The only drawback is the wait on Fridays expect an hour plus.  They have a great beer selection to entertain your taste buds while you wait."}
{"text":"Came in craving fish fry, thankfully they have it on both Wednesday and Friday nights. It was pretty delicious. Their tartar sauce is not so great though. Thankfully the delicious batter on the fish made up for it. We also tried the Swedish meatball soup which was tasty. Lastly we tried the prime rib sandwich with giardeniera. Yum! Of course you have to mention the awesome beer selection! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went here on a rainy Thursday evening and it was mildly busy. We have always like the place but the food can be very slow in coming on busy days so avoid the days like Friday night or even noon hour on the weekends. This night everything went perfectly with a good server and good food and drink. The special was  pulled pork on a nice sub type bun or roll and it was very good. Fries too. The beer selection here is huge and you can now get the beer menu on an app for your phone. You can keep track of whats available and what you have already tried I was told. I am not a big beer drinker but had one that ends in \"Hatter\" but there was more than one so I don't remember the first part. Maybe Mad? Ha. They are made by a brewery called New Holland and lots of people come here for it. Parking used to be a problem here with a small lot, but now I see there is an add on lot right next to it that has more parking places. I don't remember it being there before but maybe it was. Nice local place when not busy. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the years.  I always walk away full from amazing food, a little tipsy from great mixed drinks and a huge beer selection and wondering when I will get to come back.  The bar staff is very friendly and attentive and I love their new TV screens showing their on tap beers.  The fish fry as mentioned is awesome and their chili fries though a tad on the oily side have incredible flavor.  They have great bloody Mary's but if you ask for spicy be prepared for good spice.  The music is great, they have outdoor seating and volleyball areas and plenty of room at tables indoors as well.  I look forward to getting together with friends again soon at Dexter's because it is always such an amazing time."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Great beers on tap."}
{"text":"I don't care how good the food is or the beer selection. This was my first stop on my return to Madison, and it was horrible. 

To our waitress, who had no notion of hospitality or customer service: you messed up, and taking 90 minutes to get our order to us is totally unacceptable. Not even an apology? You should be ashamed. 

That's all I need to say, really. Piss-poor service that warrants nothing more than a single star. Bartenders were great, waitress was embarrassingly bad. Not going back."}
{"text":"Still my favorite craft brew and a bite stop! Craft brew selection sometimes a bit on the eclectic side but always interesting. You have to see the very Cool \"live\" beer list! Anything on the menu is good and not your standard pub grub - real food. Try thin crust pizza with bacon sometime - great with some beers!  Good TVs and interesting music always in background."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beer and have never had a bad meal there! Highly recommend on Friday night for the fish fry. Good prices on both alcohol and food"}
{"text":"I have to disagree with these other reviews. My husband and I frequent Dexters often and really love the place.
We haven't ever had a bad experience with the service and love the food (our faves are the waffle fries, pub chips and the burgers). 

The atmosphere isn't all that, but nonetheless it's a great little neighborhood pub with friendly bartenders, good food and great drink specials!"}
{"text":"I got into town around noon on a Wednesday and stopped here for a bite to eat and a good beer. After chatting with the bar tender for a bit I settled for something local and had a great plate of wings. My wife, who was attending a conference, made it down and had a great salad too. 

Great service and friendly staff! Would happily go back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"In on Tuesday, 7/24.  Tried the pizza burger after someone finally decided to come A. get a drink order after sitting down 5 minutes prior.  B.  Recite the specials off the chalk board because they didn't know what the specials were.  The  burger was ok, but didn't have the peperoni flavor I would have expected.  I've been here a ton of times, and the food is for the most part, very good, but service this evening was horrible.  I had to ask for another beverage 1/2 way through my meal, and ultimately walk to the bar to pay the bill.  Go drunk.  You may not notice that the staff doesn't give a crap about you, or getting your money.  We could have walked out...and almost did without paying."}
{"text":"Great food. Has a local feel, not quite dive-y but pleasantly local. Not unexpected based on the location. Went for the Bell's tap take-over for Mad-Craft-Beer-Week. Wife and I had the fish, right tastee."}
{"text":"From the reviews I am guessing we hit a bad night which was a Friday night for fish. Once seated we waited over an hour for our meal which for fried fish was too long, no excuse was ever given but was told many times our meal is up next. Once we had our meal delivered was warm, not hot and told our waitress and was was told it just came up and walked away. 

So not a good first experience.

The good, seemed like a nice neighborhood spot and friendly patrons all enjoying a Friday night, a little off the main drag which was good, so if you are looking for a hidden local spot give them a try, we will try again and hoping we just hit a bad night."}
{"text":"Visited on Sunday, the weekend of Great Taste.  Lucky for me, the tap lines were loaded with great offerings from B. Nektar and Toppling Goliath Brewery (IA), so the selection was top notch.  Plenty of others from the area, such as Summit, Ale Asylum, etc...
Pretzels were great....just enough for two.  Peppadew (sp?) and habanero mustards were bouth outstanding complements.  Habanero pineapple shrimp were delicious too and the salmon wrap and pub chips did not disappoint.  Bartender/waitress was one and the same on this day and was friendly, attentive and just all around kick-ass.
Cannot wait to stop here again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I love Dexter's. They have great bar-style food and a wonderful selection of beers. The staff is always friendly and their Friday fish fry is legendary. My husband loooves their chili and I'm often a fan of their soup of the day. Their burgers and sandwiches are top notch too; there's a chance I would sell a family member for their BLT on sourdough; who knew something so simple could be so damn amazing?"}
{"text":"I live just down the street and around the corner from Dexter's Pub and been there a couple times, but last night was a whole different experience. So different, in fact, that it inspired a rave review so here I am, raving. And I'm pretty sure it's because of what I ordered. Previously, I've enjoyed their burgers and fries - fine, good......not great. The service for me has always been friendly, attentive and helpful. And they carry Stella Cidre - so happy!

But last night I ordered the BBLT and the Garlic Chili Fries. Whaaaaat?! You guys! Do you know about the BBLT? Because if you don't, you need to know and you need to know right quick. It's a BLT with BRISKET ON IT!!! I apologize for the all caps yelling, but it can't be helped. SO! GOOD! I chose the rye bread and the sandwich was seriously sensational. Here are the stats: crispy, buttery rye bread with a thick layer of tender, succulent brisket, thick-cut bacon, and fresh lettuce & tomatoes with this lovely apple relish aioli. And then, the garlic chili fries - WOW! And the chili oil traveled around the plate in such a way that it kissed everything making it that much better. I ordered the fries with a side of ranch because that's how I roll and the cohesiveness of my meal was brilliant.

I could barely talk through the sheer bliss of all the yumminess. and now, the day after, I can't stop thinking about it. I want to have it again. Today. For lunch. But I'll exhibit some self-control and wait. Maybe I can get there this weekend......."}
{"text":"The real-time beer list above the bar is the first I have seen in town, and it sure is impressive! Being able to see the keg level helped me make a decision - the flashing red for the taps that are nearly empty gave me a sense of urgency to try those particular brews. Dexter's always has a unique beer list, and I appreciate the careful vetting by management on this. 

The food never disappoints - the garlic chili fries are the BEST. The fish fry is also worth the wait on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Cozy pub with great tap line options.  I am impressed by their dedication to adding new taps and special event tap takeovers for bringing new brews into the area.  Dexter's is also extremely fastidious in maintaining the cleanliness and temperature of their tap lines.

During my last visit I had a fresh soft pretzel from Batch Bakery served with choice of 2 dips.    The spicy ground mustard is really quite good (and indeed spicy!) and there's a beer cheese dip to fufill your nacho cheese-ish desires.  The red pepper hummus is super good with fried pita chips (but they are good for you because they are pitas, right?)

The cod for fish fry is now sourced from Bering Bounty, a local fisherman who operates a boat in Alaskan waters.  Nice crisp breading and served with cole slaw with the right balance of a touch of mayo and caraway seeds.

Drink your beer with confidence here!"}
{"text":"They've kicked up bar food.  I had a shrimp po-boy, with waffle fries.   Staff was very friendly,  and made sure we had what we needed.  

Food was hot, and good.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try for the friday fish. My husband had the blue gill, was surprised by the very small portion.  Fish was good though. I tried the shrimp poor boy. The bread was old and not toasted, but the shrimp was cooked well. But the beer was excellent.  They have quite a few to chose from."}
{"text":"As always, the beer selection here was awesome!  I'm only giving it 3 stars because this is the first time I've eaten here.  Four of us had the fish fry.  The bluegill, cod, and walleye were all battered and not crispy.  No thanks...I'll come back and try this place again, but I'll try the Reuben.  We will see if I can upgrade this rating after a second try."}
{"text":"If this is one of the best places in Madison for a fish fry.  Madison should just shut down.  Had the Walleye, I literally needed the serrated butter knife with a lot of pressure to cut through it.  I gave serious thought to going to my car to grab my hunting knife.  Cod was also ordered, still pink and didn't flake.  About 12 tables empty, maybe 5 tables with people at them.  Food order in before 5pm.  This place wasn't even close to busy to have a cook screw up an order under pressure.  I'd hate to see what happens after 6pm with a crowd.  Fish comes to you a blackened piece of charcoal?  I've never had a worse fish fry experience ever.  This place is #@#$%."}
{"text":"I will preface this with the fact I deem it deplorable that a WI fish fry joint does not have pan fish of some sort on Friday nights.

I've been to Dexters a couple times now and am in love with one thing about it; the beer selection.  Pretty impressive for a tiny little place.  Each time I've been I've gotten walleye as previously stated there is no superior crappie, bluegill, perch, etc...  and I refuse to order cod.  I've never caught a cod in WI waters and until I do I'm not ordering it.  The walleye is ok to goodish that's all that needs be said.  We again had the kid with us, and the staff was very kind and accomodating.  Also be prepared to wait for a table on Fridays, apparently I'm the only fish snob around and the cod is the hot item I guess.  The waiting isn't too bad as I said before, their beer offerings are pretty boss.  (Yeah I said 'boss', what of it?)"}
{"text":"I have been to Dexter's several times for drinks, food and football.  I love that on Badger saturdays they have a shuttle that will take you down to the stadium for the football game and pick you back up.  Their breakfast is FANTASTIC and very large portions, 2 of us usually share something.  They have a great selection of beer and pour a great drink too!  The wait staff is fantastic as well, extremely friendly and hard working.  They seem short staffed often but they all run their butts off and there is hardly a wait for anything!  Last night I had the Rueben w/ waffle fries and it was delicious!  I would suggest getting a big screen TV for watching the games but what they have works well too!  I love this place, a definitely must go to!  They also have trivia on tuesday which is a blast!  The food is great, prices are cheap, staff is fantastic...what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Best fish fry in Madison, just a bit pricey"}
{"text":"A bit troubling - they were out of the 1st four things I ordered. This said the chili was serviceable. The BBLT - Brisket, Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato was really good. It came with a generous portion of house made slow cooked brisket and thick slabs of bacon with a spicy mayo. 

There's a bid selection of craft beers and ciders on tap, as well as a healthy bottled beer selection. Overall a decent experience. But come on if you are out if all the specials take'em down Brother. It's a bit frustration when you are out of half your menu and all of your specials."}
{"text":"I wanted fish fry last night, but we didn't feel like driving, so we figured we'd give Dexter's a try. (It's 3 blocks from our house.) 

My first impression was that this place doesn't belong in Madison - it belongs somewhere much farther north. There was an awesome mix of people there, which is always a good sign for me. They had all sorts of games playing on the multiple tvs (not just basketball, hooray!) and my boyfriend was delighted to note that they have shuffleboard.

We were seated immediately (pretty good for a Friday night) and placed our drink orders. My boyfriend got a Great Lakes Irish Red something or other, and I ordered a Pyramid Winter Ale, which wasn't all that great. I personally wish that they had some more local stuff on the beer menu, but aside from that, I can't really complain about the selection.

For dinner, I ordered beer battered cod with carrot soup, and my boyfriend ordered a burger with chili garlic fries. Our food was AMAZING. This is hands down the best fish fry I've had outside of da nortwoods, definitely the best I've had in Madison so far. The soup was interesting but delicious - kind of spicy with a hint of cilantro. I didn't try my boyfriend's burger, but the chili garlic fries were awesome. I'm someone who believes that there is no such thing as too much garlic, though, so they might be a bit much for less of a garlic lover.

I am so stoked to have found a great fish fry place so close to our house. We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Hey let's grab a drink at Dexters after work! Oh, great idea, I'm in! I wish we said that more often. And yes, great beer selection (especially love the color coded items!). But, and pay attention here, chile garlic fries.  Really that's it. Yes, other food good too, but chile garlic fries.  Wine menu could be better, but is this really a wine bar? No, it's a chile garlic fries bar."}
{"text":"Dexters is hands down one of our favorite places on the east side for food and beer. 

Their sandwiches always impress -- the Windy City, the Cuban, the Reuben, the burgers and their daily specials never disappoint. Our favorite items are the garlic chili fries and old world pretzels with beer cheese dip. 

They have a huge and ever rotating selection of craft beers, and there is always something new and delicious to try. 

And a big bonus: they are SUPER kid friendly. 

Whether you're meeting an old friend for drinks or bringing the whole family for dinner, this place is a winner."}
{"text":"I live a block away, so venture here regularly.  The food is always amazing, and I'm not really into bar food.  They make their soups daily, and they are always fantastic.  They offer plenty of vegetarian options, and have now added The Impossible Burger to their menu.  The service is great, and you won't run out of beers to try.  So glad Dexters is in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I started out on a quest to find Madison's best fish fry and stumbled upon this place. One thing to know beforehand is they do not take reservations and they pack the place on Friday nights. Expect to wait a while. This is a nice little neighborhood bar on the east side of Madison that has a huge following. They offer several different types of fish for the Friday fish fry. Fried or Baked Cod, Perch, or Walleye. I went with the fried cod which was absolutely delicious. I couldn't turn down the garlic chili fries or their home made chili. Needless to say I could have used a wheel chair for the way out! It was by far one of the better fish fry joints to go to in town and I will for sure be back. My only complaint with the place was that they don't take reservations and they won't do carry out during lent (due to an overwhelming amount of business) but it's good to see a business that does so much business they have to turn some away."}
{"text":"As a regular here (Just wait yelp \"Dukedom!\") it is about damn time I write a review for Dexter's. Besides the new champion, Hopcat, this is the best beer bar in Madison. Actually, Hopcat won't even serve rare, hard to find Goose Island beer, another discussion, but many unique and very rares are served here. 

They have great food and if you can make it for a beer dinner they transform into a 4 star establishment and deliver a magnificent 5 or 6 course meal, each paired with a different beer from said brewery! 

They are blocks from my office so trust that I have warmed may a bar stool and dined plenty here. I even purchased some gems that were aged 8 YEARS here. My cellar and I have been thankful. 

Get here daily on Madison Craft Beer week and you will experience the beer version of a red carpet affair for true beer coneisseurs!

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Today was our 3rd time there. Beer selection is still really solid. Food was good. Service is slow. We had at least three tables sit after we did that got their food before us. We ordered between the three of us, two Cubans and one burger. That shouldn't take long. WTF!!! Good place to go for beers. Maybe not the greatest place for food. At least not food in under a half hour. With so many other good places in Madison, we may or may not be back after today's experience."}
{"text":"This is a corner bar gem. It isn't much to look at from the outside but the interior is warm and welcoming and instantly tantalizes you with the smell of home cooking.

The service was top notch. I wish I had gotten the name of our server but he is handsome and young, with a sandy colored moustache and hair. He was attentive, without being overbearing and so very pleasant.

Our food was hot, delicious and served in a timely fashion. My friend and I shared a pretzel and the chile/garlic fries and they did not disappoint. I also had the Chipotle chicken soup, so I asked for sour cream to cool down my spicy choices. It came immediately. Bravo!!!

Justin wrapped up our evening with more genuinely fun and friendly service, checking in on us as we continued our meal. 

I'm happy that places like this exist and I will be back!

Ooh, p.s. , I'm supposed to mention Biff. Hi, Biff!"}
{"text":"A Pub serving Lagunitas' beer on the tap gets an automatic 4 stars in my book keeping. I can't rave enough about how delicious the pint of Gnarleywine was.

The food is solid, as many people have already Yelped. 
My lake perch was delicious - in my opinion, better than Avenue Bar's. I was full when I finished the 1/4 of their huge serving portion. 

Good mix of crowd. Kids, 20-somethings, old and all. I shall be back there to sample more beer and heckle at Olympic games on a TV screen."}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to the world of craft beers, but I'm a big fan of the beer list here. Always something new and interesting to try.

I haven't had a proper dinner here yet, just appetizers. They have been just \"ok\". The menu sounds promising, though.

I like the open style of the kitchen area, always curious to see what folks are up to in there. The wait staff was very attentive, if slightly impersonal, as well. I found it odd that a waitress was allowed to work wearing flip flops, though. (I notice details.)

It was a nice cozy place to wind up the end of my work week last night. To be continued..."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite local hangouts, Dexter's is a \"dive\" bar without the \"dive.\" The beer selection is wonderful, bartenders and staff are knowledgeable and attentive, and the food is well above typical bar food standards. There are tables for dining, a long bar for sitting and watching the game, and volleyball courts out back for summer fun. If you're going for the food, I have to recommend the fish fry and/or nacho platter. If you're going for the beer, you won't be disappointed. And if you're looking for a fun place to watch a Badger victory with friends, you've got the right bar."}
{"text":"Garlic chili fries... that blue cheese dressing you make... the prime rib, burgers, fish, all the specials... so freakin' good. Beer choices for days.

Affordable prices, great food, great people, laid back vibe. Doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Fantastic Wisconsin bar food, especially Friday night Fish Fry (I usually order the lemon-pepper grilled walleye and my husband likes the traditional fried cod), soft pretzels with cheese sauce, burgers and homemade soups. I like Dexter's for lunch as well and think that the homemade soup and fresh side salad is one of the best deals for lunch in Madison. 

Stellar rotation of tap beers that are well curated. There is frequently something new and delicious to try. Their beer selection spans many different beer styles, breweries, and regions of the country. I appreciate that they don't try to do it by having a million on tap all the time. The staff can always speak to the beer that I inquire about and are happy to provide a sample before you order a full glass. In general, the service is always friendly.

Don't forget to ask for a cupcake!"}
{"text":"This place has the best, hands down absolute best fish fry.  Get it baked or batter fried, they're both mouthwatering just thinking about them is making me long for Friday nights.
Baked potatoes are always perfect.  Salad or soup before fish comes is always great and fresh.  
Lots of fun brews and brewery take overs. 
Burgers are also the Bomb!  
Chili is just spicy enough to warm you and flavorful tomato base is the best with cheese and a bit of sour cream.  
Never disappointed here, ever. 
Staff all very knowledgable of the brews which are two pages of choices.  Tasters are always offered if you're not sure you'll like them. 
Usually a wait anywhere from 10-45 minutes, longer in summer time, but certainly worth the wait.  Enjoy a drink at the bar area and unwind a bit before you're seated."}
{"text":"Just in case anyone was wondering... the Italian beef sandwich and hot wings are just as tasty when you take them to go. You know... in case you needed that information. 
I crisped up the waffle fries in the oven when I got home, and it was like sitting there. But without the friendly faces and awesome tap line up."}
{"text":"I love coming to Dexter's as not only is it in my neighborhood and convenient but also a quality neighborhood bar. They have a hanging rotation of craft beer with a menu that tells you how much of the keg is left. I've also tried a lot of their food menu and I have always been satisfied. They have great cheese curds and I love their waffle fries. They have a bar area and also a dining area that is more of a sit down affair but very causal. You'll be able to catch a game when you come and in the summer you can form a team and join the volleyball league. There are also darts some digital gambling games and even pull tabs! Good times all around!"}
{"text":"Great pub food and WI brew beer list which changed frequently. It's in a neighborhood and has limited parking, but has a great local bar atmosphere.  Went with 3 coworkers and we all loved our sandwiches and burgers. Our server was very attentive and helpful. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with pretty high expectations.  With all the hype of the beer and fish fry, it sounded like a great fit for me.  With one visit, I can safely say that this place is now off of my list.

We got in right at 5:30 and there were only a couple of tables seated.  Our meal started off pretty rough.  We ordered the blue gill and the lemon pepper walleye.  I tried to order a baked potato, but was met with the curt response of \"not until 6\".  Despite the advertised time of 5:30 for them, I still had to dig for any kind of reason.  Then she didn't even give me the other options when I asked, my fiance ended up reading them off of the menu.

The tap selection was decent, thought there wasn't much in my wheelhouse.  They were also a bit pricier than I am accustomed to.  Overall, not too bad, but I'll keep to my other spots for beer instead.

When the fish arrived, it was clear that this wasn't close to the level that the hype suggested.  The blue gill were limp and had no crispness.  The walleye, which was the boniest piece of fish I have had in years, had a soggy skin and no hint of lemon or pepper.  I really like the idea of them using sustainable wild caught fish.  And the local premise is something that draws me in.  But the execution of this was incredibly poor.  The best I can say is that, despite being poorly prepared, the fish tasted ok.

If it wasn't for good beer, I wouldn't be able to give this any more than a 1 star.  With Madison having so many fish fry options, you're better off going elsewhere.  The mediocre options in the area that I have had all stand above this."}
{"text":"Dexter's Pub is a great neighborhood bar. Good beer selection, which always rotates. Great service, friendly staff. I have always gone on Wednesday night for trivia (8pm) and its usually full but you can always get a seat if you arrive around 7:30pm.

Last time, I had the portabella mushroom sandwich. It was good, but sort of lacked portabella (the piece was pretty small and meek). The waffle fries were good. Also tried the hummus one time, which was awesome!

Overall, Dexter's is a cool spot that I will continue to frequent!"}
{"text":"Best fish fry in Madison! Stellar beer selection. Great family environment and very reasonable kids menu."}
{"text":"My husband, my mom, and I braved Dexter's on a Friday night for fish. Oh man, I am so glad we did!

We went into it expecting a wait, and we did end up waiting about an hour and a half. At first, we had to stand in the bar area, but we got drinks relatively quickly and were able to snag a table after about a half hour of standing. Their beer selection is amazing. I tried 3 different new-to-me beers and there were still a bunch more I wanted to taste. Hooray for options!

We ordered soon after sitting down and didn't have to wait long for our appetizer (spinach dip with veggies & pita). The dip was good and their pita (fried) was as awesome as you would assume fried pita would be.

Our meals were great too! Between the three of us we had cod, perch (or bluegill? woops, can't remember), and a shrimp po-boy. I would order any of our three choices again.

In summary: the fish fry is worth the wait & the Friday night crowd."}
{"text":"I've been to Dexter's several times before for drinks and really liked the place, and a few months ago we went for the Friday fish fry and the food was delicious- some of the best fish fry we've had in Madison.  However, when we went back a month or so later, we had a horrible experience.  We had to wait nearly 45 minutes for our food and then when we got it- it was terrible.  My boyfriend had the garlic chili fries and they arrived not only COLD, but DOUSED in disgusting grease- they were inedible.  We mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to bring a new order, but it turned out the new order was just as terrible as the first one.  I had the roast beef sandwich and it was horrible- very dry and bland.  To her credit, the waitress did give us free cupcakes to take home to make up for the horrible food (although it turned out the cupcakes were also inedible and terrible).  

We hoped this was just an unusually busy night and not the norm, and because the fish fry is so good, we went back again tonight, hoping for a better experience.  We were wrong!  We went around 7 and waited 15 min or so for a table.  Once we were seated we placed our order right away with the waiter, since we already knew what we wanted.  An hour later, we were still waiting for our food.  All we ordered was the fish and waffle fries- so nothing complicated- and on such a busy night, you'd think they'd be making sure to keep batches of fish and fries going steadily into the fryer.  When we finally got our food, it was the tasty fish we'd remembered from before, but by that time, we were so tired and crabby from having to wait for so long, it wasn't quite so enjoyable.  After our meal, we had to wait quite a long time for the waiter to bring the check, and then he didn't come back to pick it up for a good 15 minutes.  We would still go back to Dexter's just for drinks, but I don't think we'll be going there to eat the food anymore.  Two terrible experiences with inexcusably long waits is enough to keep us from going back for dinner.  It's too bad because the fish is good, but not good enough to justify the SLOW service.

Edit: Turns out the fish wasn't so good- ended up being up all night with food poisoning.  Yup, definitely will NOT be going back there for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great local pub!  The staff are super friendly.  My favorite menu items are the reuben, a  great, great bloody mary.  great beer, santa fe chicken salad, and the dogpile.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are great food!  I want to keep it my secret, but its too great to not share."}
{"text":"Dexter's is a nice neighborhood bar with good beer selection, and GREAT drink specials. Always something to drink for cheap. I only discovered this when looking for a place to watch the Stanley Cup playoffs (Go Hawks!). 

The food is pretty mediocre. The pizza is good - they seem to make it fresh. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here had I not lived in the neighborhood at the time. The pub quiz seems to be a good pull on Tuesdays, outdoor volleyball too, and the crowd seems fun in general."}
{"text":"As a non beer lover (I know, I know), I wasn't expecting to fall in love with Dexter's.  I don't think one has to worry about that considering my experience.  Our food was just so...terrible.  I ordered the salmon salad, not having any huge expectations with it due to ordering it at a hipsterish hole in the wall type establishment.  The salmon was a weird color...it had greasy fried peppers, croutons, tomatoes and cucumber...I was pretty sure I was going to get food poisoning but miraculously, I did not.  My husband ordered a burger....the bun was dry and crusty, he asked for it medium well and it was slightly alive still.  Plus, they didn't even provide a leaf of lettuce or tomato.  Just cheese, a ball of raw hamburger and 1/3 of a slice of bacon.  Our meal was so unsatisfying but at least the waffle fries were the highlight of the night!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Both for fish fry and over a year a part. I can say that this is a good place to come if you are looking for a Friday Fish Fry in Madison and don't want a fancy place.

They have tons of beers on tap, and as other Yelpers have posted you can see when the barrel was tapped and how much is left. There is typically a wait, but we just order a few drinks and hang out until a table is ready. Our service has always been just fine. We've also seen some people grab takeout, so that may be an option as well.

Overall I would recommend this place for a standard no fuss bar fish fry. I can't comment on the other menu items."}
{"text":"Was very impressed with how clean the bathroom is (and smells really good). Great taste weekend/Toppling Goliath. The service is great. Really nice neighborhood bar. Good food and they brought us a pitcher of water without us asking. I mean really, this place is setting a standard. I also appreciate the chalkboard art!  thank you for being awesome, Dexter's Pub!"}
{"text":"I tried their fish fry for the first time. I had the fried cod. The fish was tender and fresh while the batter was crunchy and seasoned well. The contrast in texture was exactly what you want in a fish fry. I'll definitely give their fish fry another try. They have salmon, walleye, and shrimp for other fish fry options as well. 

Hey have a great beer menu and are always rotating their selections. This is a great local bar with good beer, and good food. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Still tasty!  This is just an update to say that trivia night is only on Tuesdays now, and Friday night is very busy with their fish fry - so go early!"}
{"text":"Legit beer selection, delicious Reuben!! I wasn't sure who I was tipping, as several people stopped at our table, but overall it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"I came through this dive while pub-crawling amongst friends. As we lined up at the bar to order beers and grub -- the bartender's muttering under her breath \"oh shit.\" should have tipped us off to the piss poor service that awaited us. Apparently they're not accustomed to seeing a group of ~12 people waltz in this dump. Go fig'. Mind you, we were very accommodating, and considerate of the surprise rush we created. However, when they served our table separately and completely forgot my food, I was forced to demand a refund. They're lucky I wasn't a complete a**hole and demanded the portion of the tip that I already paid toward my food order.

Sure, if you're looking for a very lonely dive all to yourself and a /few/ friends, this might be your place. But for us, it was a complete and utter disaster.

Oh, did I mention the incessant flies throughout the establishment? Yeah, not cool."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and service. Everything on the menu is excellent but the Friday Fish Fry is an event. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We come here for fish fry quite often. It can be a long wait but the often over estimate the time. They may tell you 2 hrs but its never that long. In fact I think they probably lose business by telling people there is a super long wait. I get they want to be careful and they're pretty busy so maybe they don't mind. It can take a while for food to come out, they have a pretty small kitchen.

We usually wait at the bar and grab a drink. They make a good old fashioned and have a impressive beer selection with a neat TV with all their choices. It shows what on tap with a description of the beer and what beer is gonna be on next.

All the fish is good, I really like the perch. Last time I got a baked white fish, cod maybe, I can't remember. The flavor was good but there were a lot of small bones, a few is fine but there were a lot. I'll stick to the fried fish I think next time. Overall, great place for fish fry and a nice bar."}
{"text":"No carry out on Friday nights!?!  I'm new to the area and was looking to trying Dexters Friday fish fry after hearing so many great reviews. Unfortunately I didn't get the chance as they do not provide a carry out option on Friday nights. I was speechless went told this over the phone!  I did try another place (Brothers Three) that was happy to provide carry out to this customer and it was wonderful!"}
{"text":"This was the best piece of battered cod I have had in a good while.  The breading was not too salty and not too thick.  The grilled walleye that my girlfriend had melted in your mouth and didn't even require any additional butter sauce.

Typically I would get a wine to pair with my fish but this week is Craft Week so I had a IPA called Alive instead, which I felt paired well given the flavor of the brew.  This is my new favorite place on the east side of Madison!!"}
{"text":"After reading several rave reviews for the fish fry we decided to try this place.  We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday in Lent and knew we were already in trouble when parking was hard to find.  The dining room was packed and we were told there would be an hour wait.  Since we had driven across town, we decided to wait it out in the bar.  There is plenty of room to wait and have a beer from the huge selection they have.  In 30 minutes we were called for our table.  Two of us ordered the lake perch and one ordered the deep fried cod.  There is also baked cod, walleye, blue gill and shrimp to choose from.  The fish comes with your choice of  - baked potato, waffle fries, pub fries, homemade potato chips, and some other things like cottage cheese etc.  We had waffle fries, potato chips and the pub fries, which are beer pattered.  You also get a small container of cole slaw and a white grocery store roll.  There was a short wait for our fish, but the dining room was still packed.  When it arrived, it was hot, tasty and a generous serving.  We were all very satisfied with our dinner.  I thought the homemade potato chips were excellent, they came out warm and crispy.  The only thing I did not care for was the tartar sauce, can't place what it was, but had a funny taste to it to me.  Everyone that waited on us was friendly and efficient without being intrusive.  Wish this place was closer to my side of town, but we will definitely try it again.  Get there early or expect to wait!"}
{"text":"**Don't pass up the garlic chile fries!**

I love the tap beer selection and all of the entrees we've tried have been great!"}
{"text":"Dexter's is Delicious! 

I have been in to Dexter's numerous times now. I started coming here a few years back when I first started going to the Great Taste of the Midwest. Dexter's has a shuttle bus that picks up from their location and takes folks down the event. Such a nice service, and a good way to fuel up and get a good hearty breakfast in before drinking all day long :) 

So I have had their breakfast offerings a few times now, every time has been great. I've also had lots of their appetizers. The pretzel with dipping sauces (beer cheese is my fave!) is REALLY tasty. The pub chips are great and the french onion dip they come with is even better. Thick and creamy, flavor is spot on! 

Dexter's has a HUGE selection of beers, in both cans/bottles as well as tap. They have an awesome electronic display board up above the bar that shows everything on tap, as well as how full the keg is! No more disappointing orders when what you asked for just happens to spent. 

My only minor gripe is how tiny some of the tables are. Yes, they have a dining room with regular sized tables, I know. But if you want to sit in the bar area, several of the tables are seriously the size of a TV tray. Super small. But, like I said, that's minor."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Food is good and priced fair. Crowd was a bit rambunctious but it was Saturday afternoon. Excellent selection of beer. A couple of good food selections for the vegetarians like me among us. Wife had the burger and reported good results. I had the stuffed cheese sandwich very good not greasy as most are. Will visit again."}
