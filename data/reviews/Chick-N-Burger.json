{"text":"druggies and drunks make the atmosphere. the food's reasonably priced, cooked to order, and the beer is cold. what do you expect when you pay $3.50 for a burger, fries and pop?"}
{"text":"Chick N Burger. Cheap and delicious.  No food poisoning to date. (yelp reviews are a little harsh). If questionable  washrooms, a drunk and drugged out crowd is not for you then keep on truckin.  However your served by an elderly asian lady whose smile lights the dingiest corners, beer is cold, the patio encourages smoking. A nice family joint."}
{"text":"Just bad. Bad burger, drunks hanging around, just bad."}
{"text":"avoid at all costs. a shit hole ,druggies,and drunks lingering about this place. it used to be a great place back in 1965,66."}
{"text":"Got really bad runs. Food is not great but very cheap. Hope its real. A drunks heaven."}
{"text":"I believe this restaurant is only open to run drugs of some sort. It never has anyone but druggies around and really brings the area down. Licks definitely didn't close due to this competition."}
