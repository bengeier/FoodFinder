{"text":"I've been meaning to try Nora Gray for some time, as the owner/chef once worked at Joe Beef, which is basically the golden standard of Le Sud Ouest and it was featured on the latter's episode of Munchie's Chef's Night Out. 

Being vegan as consistently as possible, it was important to me that they be able to cater to my dietary restrictions, so I called ahead to be sure and received a pleasant response to my query. The vibe of the small, intimate eatery was cozy and quirky in the best of ways. Front of house staff were dressed informally, which spoke to the laid-back vibe of the place. Service was attentive without being overbearing and our server gladly offered wine pairings to each course. 

I had lovely grilled summer vegetables as an antipasto, which they removed the anchovy vinaigrette from at my request. It was topped off with crunchy, breakcrumbs, which were slightly salty for my taste. Opting to skip the primo, I went straight for a secondo of creamy courgette and pine nut risotto (vegan!) topped with rich, buttery wild mushroom. The second offering was delicious, perfectly balanced, and filling. For dessert, the server thoughtfully mentioned that the chocolate mousse with candied oranges and cookie-like crunchies was a vegan-friendly option. The taste of the orange was strong, but incredibly earthy and natural, while the texture of the mousse was velvety and decadent. Overall, the quality of the food was impeccable. 

My only issue with my experience is that I found it to be somewhat pricey for the portion size, a problem that was consistent through each course. Dine at Nora Gray if you are able to savour and appreciate, as opposed to devour; it is food which tickles the palate and deserves to be treasured."}
{"text":"1st official review of a Montreal Restaurant!! usually i do them when i go on vacation!!

and Nora deserves it. almost a 5 star rating, but came close

1st of all, i love the place it has a 60's-70's basement look and vibe (music in the place was good, but some might complain about it) and the staff too is a bit old fashioned!!

food was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G (except for the large pasta portion, that was too small for my liking and priced a bit high) but those meatballs... and that piglet was HUGE and delicious. also had a good (not great) rabbit. the wine selection was pretty neat but i think the prices were a tad high considering that only 3-4 wines were under 40$ (i like to have a «cheaper» bottle a the end mostly when i took 2 that were over 60$). one last small complaint... a 5$ lattè... really? hey, i love to spend money on food and boos but those small things really bother me

i had read some reviews about noise and slow service, but on that night it was PERFECT (we had the 2nd seating around 9pm)

would love to go back with a group of friends, but the place is quite smallish (i would recommend 4 to 6 people to really enjoy the place)

and my GF wants to add that Hal Gill was there and he's soooooooooooo cute!

Forza Nora"}
{"text":"Nora Gray is a delightful little spot and a nice addition to the Griffintown neighbourhood. Recently ranked among the best new restaurants in Canada by enRoute magazine, Nora Gray harkens back to another era with its decor and food selections. The wood panelling and black leather-coated banquets create an inviting spot where one can enjoy the delightful Italian nosh of this Montreal bistro. 

This place is definitely a hipster hotspot. The bartenders are clad in workman's wear with sleeves of tattoos and military-style crew cuts, perhaps a familiar scene for a certain sub-set of Montrealais. The waitstaff were extremely attentive--taking our coats, fetching us some much needed vino blanco and checking in with us throughout the meal. The crowd was young on Friday night with a smattering of thirtysomethings and in-the-know foodies. 

As for the food, I had the deep-fried ricotta meatballs to start and they were divine. While the portions are on the small size, the three balls are about the size of a bouncy ball, they're jam-packed with flavour. My partner had the tripe and, while not for everyone, he wolfed it down and said it was top-notch. Tripe is beef intestines, so not necessarily for the faint of heart. 

My main--the walnut-stuffed rabbit--was delicious, although a bit gamey in taste for my liking. But it was melt in your mouth soft and well-seasoned. The walnut puree in the centre was a nice addition as was the accompanying vegetable puree (I think potato?) that was underneath the rabbit itself. Another diner in our party had the chicken and he was more than impressed with the large-in-size chicken breast and accompanying tomato-based sauce. All of our plates were practically licked clean. 

The cocktail menu is also an attraction at this cave-like spot. The bartenders are busy pouring stiff drinks for all to enjoy. They have a large selection of liquors and liqueurs so you could indulge in a post-dinner aperitif if you're so inclined. The dessert selection looked underwhelming so we passed. 

It is advisable to make reservations for this hotspot. With the recent enRoute ranking, the restaurant has only seen its popularity soar. A warning to all large parties: this place is best suited for groups of four or less. There is not a lot of seating--the place can probably sit a maximum of 30 guests at one time--so your party will not fit comfortably into this space. But do not let this dissuade you as it is part of its intimate charm. 

If you're in the mood for some locally-sourced deliciousness in a funky and hip environment than Nora Gray will certainly fit the bill. Be prepared to drop around $60-70 per person including wine, appetizers and main course but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The pea and leek soup was very delicious as was the pappardelle with rabbit. A highly recommended Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"The best meal of my life!
I was visiting Montreal from my mostly vegetarian existence in Vancouver and my friend took me to one of his favourite restaurants. I was truly blown away.
Although I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about wine, their wine list was full of exotic bottles I had never heard of.  We were skilfully guided through our various options and when we narrowed what we were looking for we were charmingly told the background of the particular vineyard.  
We went for a series of different dishes that we split. The first course (which I thought was the entire meal) was a spread of 3 quite different dishes. The crostini with the marscapone, proscuitto, and peaches was unlike anything I had eaten before. The salty sweetness combined with creaminess was incredible. 
It was my first time eating rabbit ever and the rabbit canneloni dispelled any preconception I had. It had a savoury meatiness with a tomato sauce that was incredibly fresh tasting.  A lovely fresh buratta with tiny perfectly cooked chantrelles completed the course.
Second course consisted of two pork sausages on creamy polenta and a stuffed veal roll. The sausages were flecked with fennel (anise?) , which I normally dislike but brought out depths to the meat I had never tasted before. The veal roll was a wonderful meaty melange with a quails egg in the centre. 
Great atmosphere with a great playlist and a cozy vibe. The service was the kind of crazily informed professionalism that can only come from people who love what they do and take pride in it.
I honestly think my palate has been increased from the unique flavours I tried that night. 
 Thanks for a great meal and I hope to visit next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"I love that restaurant it's my second time. The service is perfect and the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Excellente cuisine mélangeant amertume et douceurs! Ambiance feutrée, soirée intime et chaleureuse. Un classique moderne."}
{"text":"During a week in Montréal  filled with exceptional meals at places like Joe Beef, Au Pied de Cochon, Brasserie T, L'Express ...and on... Nora Gray was our best night out.  We sat at the bar, and sampled several specials first;  perfectly fresh, sweet snow crab, and lobster \"salad\" with fiddleheads, avocado and ramp leaves.  Next,  the veal cheek & guitar string pasta, which was probably the most delicious, deeply savory pasta I've ever had, and the snow crab tagilatelle, which was amazing as well. Our mains were branzino and guinea hen, and both great examples of how these proteins should be treated.  Knowing  in advance that the owners were longtime Joe Beef front- and back-of-the-house veterans, we'd expected a somewhat similar feel and cuisine.  Instead we got  something completely its own, from the decor (which harkens back to Wallpaper magazine in it's 2000-era heyday, in the best sense) to the food -- expertly subtle and complex yet light, and brimming with perfect flavor combinations. At one point early in our meal, my husband turned to me and said \"Joe Beef was so amazing and unique, but I don't get the sense that they're trying to KILL me with their food here!\"  Lol.   Add this the fact that we spend hours talking to partners Ryan, Emma and Lisa, sharing NYC and Montreal food stories and generally engaging in whatever that je-ne-sais-crois is that gets people hooked into this crazy business in the first place...well... It was beyond awesome.  Go."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Everything about it is worth gushing over. The cocktails were amazing. The service was great. The food was impeccable. The decor outside and inside was very nice. I loved the ambience.

We had a variety of cocktails and they were all delicious; crisp and refreshing and pleasing to the eye. We started with the veal skewers - I usually stay away from veal but this was really yum and the olive oil potatoes... I could have a bowl of it and be very very happy. 

For entrée, I had the pork collar. They only make it medium pink and it was cooked to perfection. So juicy and so so so flavorful. 

10/10 I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We went to this place on an occasion thinking is a good place to have a special night. I had the sausage which was supposed to be very unique but I could get a better one at Costco. The food was awful, super salty and not fresh at all, I assume the beans were made weeks ago.  We also had the pork steak which again was very salty and hard to eat. The waiters were not pro at all. This place should be a cheap diner place with half a dollar sign, not $$$. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious. I was visiting from NYC, and I wanted to pack my suitcase full of this food. Delicious. Great cocktails. Nice hip/local atmosphere. Winner."}
{"text":"Excellent what more can you say when the food is that good. The service was exceptional and atmosphere really nice."}
{"text":"Bien que ce restait soit situé dans un genre demi sous sol, on a adoré l'ambiance en arrivant . Ambiance Mad Man, cocktails surprenants. Plats originaux inégaux. Les pop Corn de Ris de veaux à partager à ne pas manquer. Bémol : staff un peut trop relax pour le prix de l'addition finale assez salée..."}
{"text":"The service was curtuous and knowledgeable... The food was quite ordinary, not the level of what I expected from the critics I read on that restaurant.  The decor is rather dark and sad, the tables were too close to a point that you cannot hear the people sitting at your own table.
A disappointing experience"}
{"text":"This place needs more reviews so people will be enticed to go there.

We were there on a saturday night for a friends birthday and we were not disappointed! Nice ambiance, good music, busy, but attentive staff. I believe the cook used to be at the Liverpool House (sic Joe Beef). It is in an odd location, which makes parking easy to find, and after dinner we walked up to Crescent Street, so not too far from the action. Impressive wine list.

My husband had the pumpkin ravioli (1/2 size is 3 largish ravioli) as a starter. It was like eating little pumpkin pies, so delicious but with a little kick. A friend had the winter vegetable salad and swears he could eat one everyday for lunch! I had the rabbit pate but I thought it was a little bland.

My husband had fish with a light tomato sauce and crispy onions, so yummy, a friend had the suckling pig with chestnuts and raved, his wife had the sweet and sour rabbit - yum yum, and I had the pistachio stuffed lamb. Oh the lamb! The lamb and stuffing were delicious, perfectly cooked, but the star of the show were these unbelievable gnocchi like morsels made with ricotta cheese, mint and peas - I think? I can't remember what they were called but what a delicious combination of chewy, salty, fresh herbiness! How delicious? Everyone at the table ordered dessert, but I ordered a side of the gnocchi for dessert. Soooo good! My mouth is watering just thinking about them!

I tasted the chocolate semifreddo, yum, the goat milk cheese cannoli, super yum, and  a lovely selection of cheeses after.

The portion sizes were just right, and all and all , a delicious meal. 1/2 star off for the bland rabbit pate, and 1/2 star off because we never seemed to have water on our table, in as much as there was no carafe, and the staff was too busy to come by and fill our glasses very often. Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this place, and I will definitely go back, hopefully soon :). A keeper!"}
{"text":"I was blown away.... Amazing food, just amazing. Staff was great and the atmosphere was spot-on. All 3 owners were there and we spoke to 2 of them several times. Great people, very down to earth. They opened an awesome place.. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"8$ for 3 itty-bitty- beignettes with mascarpone. Really? Oh yeah I pulled out a \"really\" on this one. We are talking big bucks for simple Italian comfort food at this place. Pasta bolognese $$$. What? These guys are crazy and I hope they enjoy the hype, because the place seems like a little hobby resto for the owners. I felt like I was in an 18 year olds 'living room with an Ipod tracklist playing in the background. The music and the crappy system, totally messed up the vibe. They managed to put together a nice italo-modern interiour design concept, but this is crushed by the horribly loud music that had aucune rapport with the concept. I was simply, shocked. Go here if you what to maintain your hipster image, when everybody knows you work in a bank during the day. How else could you afford anything at this resto without a real job? Selling street art? DJing? \"Modelling\"? $11+ glasses of wine? With no price range? For these prices, I expect a pro- DJ and an upgraded sound system. It is packed thurs, fri, sat, so you must reserve if you expect to get a table in this kleenexbox. Maybe it will improve? I hope so, because it's a fun concept."}
{"text":"Easily one of my best meals. Tiny but well appointed modern Italian concept with a great (dare I say slightly hipster)  vibe and authentic Italian food. 

Bonus points for serving me a great aperol spritz (my go-to Italian apero) and making every item on the menu sound delicious. 

The octopus entree and polenta fries were fantastic and the rabbit and lamb mains equally so. The perfect ending was a fresh zeppole. 

Full points for great, friendly service which included a complimentary digestif. 

I can't wait to go back and sample everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"A flawless and perfect, dinning experience! To which I highly recommend for all of you. I also strongly advice you to make reservations ahead of time. If you like to take foodie photos, a window seat is recommend it! Available upon request only!

When walking into the restaurant to which my kind friend Ann suggested for both of us to go dine here, I knew I was in the right place. The ambiance is charming, simple, and modern, but not too modern. Simply just right! 

When entering the restaurant greeted by a very kind and friendly hostess, I noticed that their  staff followed my request beautifully! We had a lovely table for two, with a window view provided great amount of light to take photos. The seats are quite comfortable. 

Our meals.. 

Ann began by selecting a wine to which she didn't care much about. No worries, our waitress was kind enough to have her sample another one, to see which was the perfect wine to pair with her meals. Finally, a  glass of wine was selected. 

We chose to select two appetizers. A charcuterie platter which consisted of house made picked fresh fennel, with a great zingy touch to it. Along with Prosciutto and Prosciutto Cotto(Smoked cooked ham) both very tender, flavorful and silky.  With a great smokey touch to it! 
Alongside we ordered the Hof Kelsten(Big fan of them!) Fresh crusty white bread, with a dish of cold pressed extra virgin olive oil to lightly dip the bread in it. Fantastic! 
One small negative remark, I wished our bread would have been warm or lightly toasted. Luckily it was very fresh so it was delicious anyways. 

Our main dish.
As we both ordered the same thing. Fafalle with Summer fresh vegetables(Asparagus, green peas) on a light sauce and finished with a sprinkling of Ricotta Salata. Pasta was cooked to a perfect Al Dente! 

To end our meal on a sweet note. Again we both ordered the same dessert. A tender, lemon poppy individual size bunt cake. Alongside of lemon Mascarpone, finished with caramelized thin lemon strips and European white chocolate shavings. The perfect ending to a already wonderful dinning experience. 

Overall the entire night with a night of perfection. Service was on point. Glasses of water were never emptied, service was kind and very professional with a few laughs here and there. 
The only minor negative detail I have found, the menu lacks a bit of variety. Mostly in the entrees and dessert area. I can assure you that this minor detail will not stop me from returning again, and again. 

Nora Gray has lived up to it's reputation and I can understand why. I hope you have the chance to experience it as well. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about Nora Gray and we've been wanting to eat here for some time. Finally we got ourselves organized and to have dinner here with some friends. 

Given all the hype I was really expecting something spectacular and I must admit that I was disappointed. As a hungry group of four we were able to sample a good part of the menu:

We started with:
- deer heart, which was the best dish of the evening
- octopus, which was a bit rubbery, not nearly as moist as it could have been
- goat cheese ricotta tart
- arancic, good but nothing out of this world
- chestnut pasta with hare stew 

The main courses that we had were:
- grilled quail with a side of chickpea fritters, the fritters were amazing and a definite standout
- duck breast 
- a stuffed pasta (can't remember the exact dish)
- tuna, the tuna was pretty dry and not very tender or flavorful 

Overall the food was all good, with the exception of the tuna and octopus which were disappointing. However, nothing was in the blow your mind category or particularly memorable which I would have expected from a restaurant that has so much hype around it."}
{"text":"Date night with the hubby. We've been to Nora Gray several times and it never disappoints. Tonight I ordered the shrimp antipasto, the special orecchiette pasta and the wild boar. Each dish was delicious. Sadly my eyes were bigger than my stomach and I couldn't finish the wild boar or try the desserts (which all sounded great). My husband was just as pleased with his order of meatballs, squid ink pasta w crab, and quail. The service was good but I thought the dishes came out a tad too quickly. E.g. We arrived at 9:15 and we're eating our last course by 10:15. Overall though Nora Gray is one of my favourite Montréal restaurants."}
{"text":"Nora Gray.  How embarrassing for a restaurant of this caliber to serve frozen fish and not admit it.

Our server was lovely.  Our salad delightful.  Our fish...the first was rock hard.  Though our waitress said the manager would come over, he did not.  The second time the fish was probably microwaved first.  it was tasty but very soft and had at least 20 bones.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Ate here in June and was supremely underwhelmed. The food looked great and was good, but really safe. I like adventure in my dining experiences and this fell flat in that respect. If you like very well done, simple food, then this is for you. Personally I'd rather go for a more out of the box culinary spot. Again, food was good but far from exciting. Great service and drinks."}
{"text":"My friend recommended Nora grey and boy did it not disappoint.

Since this was a birthday dinner, we ordered a few things that were all good. The waitress was sweet and so friendly. She brought one wine that we didn't like as much so she brought another that was delicious and ultimately paired with everything we ate.

We started with the bread and a green salad. As simple as bread and olive oil is, the spicy oil puts it over the top and was so delicious. The green salad was a perfect fresh starter. Nicely dressed, well balanced and just a nice way to start.

We then had the mezzaluna pasta dish. The pasta was really nice with a squash purée but what made it delicious was the Guinea hen. When you mix it all into one bite it was perfect.

The main course was the TBone for 2. The waitress said \"it's a big plate\" and looking at the other dishes I wasn't expecting something huge but she was right, it was massive. It came with delicious fries, carrots and Brussels sprouts. The best part was the steak. She didn't ask how we wanted it cooked but that speaks to the chef's ability. The sauce and steak was just delicious. I can't speak to how much we enjoyed it and since this is almost always on the menu, I strongly suggest it. Oh and it's also Quebec meat, which as I keep learning is really good beef.

We ended with the chocolate prune cake with earl grey gelato with orange on the top. It was so moist and rich but really tasty. Try having a bite with all components because they play so well together. 

We went to the 7pm seating on a Friday, service was fast and everything had the perfect temperature. I recommend this place to whoever is coming to the city and want modern Italian at its finest. It didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Here is why I think Nora Gray is worthy of a 5-star rating:

A simple, beautiful and charming decor that makes you feel like you're somewhere special. It's small, private and elegant but not too much. It acts as a neutral canvas to what really makes this restaurant so special:

Taste + Execution + Service

It all comes together beautifully at Nora Gray. Me and my wife had a total of 6 items on the menu and all had incredibly bold, uncompromising yet perfectly balanced flavors. The highlights for me were the spaghetti w/ truffle shavings (divine slap you in the face rich flavors here) and the hot pot with chick peas and vegetables (THE best dish I have ever had in any restaurant in Montreal - and in my top 5 all-time. I've rarely had food that combines such powerful and diverse flavors while keeping them all so well balanced. For the vegetarians out there this is the dish for you.. and even those who eat meat, give it a try I promise you'll love it.)

Every element in each dish were perfectly cooked and seasoned. You might expect this from any good restaurant, but the reality is they often miss the mark in some varying degrees of ways, even the good ones. No such thing at Nora Gray. We couldn't find a flaw even when we tried the day after.

Finally, the service is excellent. My truffle toast was late to come with my soup by 5 minutes and they didn't charge me for it. The staff were all very friendly, attentive and professional.

As far as my own experiences go, Nora Gray is one of the very best restaurants in Montreal and I very highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Perfect decor and ambiance for a date. The service is impeccable and some of the dishes, such as the buratta, agnolotti and bolognese, were home runs. 

Pro tip: This restaurant is located in the neighborhood where everyone parks their cars during Habs games at the Bell Centre. So, if you're driving there and it's a game night, plan to spend some extra time searching the area for a parking spot."}
{"text":"Love the little neighborhood restaurants. This cute little place does not disappoint. Service was amazing and so was the food (we had a little of everything) & drinks! Nick, the hostesses, and the staff was amazing."}
{"text":"If you don't try to go, you'll miss more than dinner. Forget about the meal for a moment, and imagine you're re-connecting with friends you haven't seen in forever, and throw in excellent food. Listen to your waiters. You won't be misguided. If you can't listen to them, then enjoy looking at them. Easy on the eyes for the ladies and gentlemen. If you can do neither, leave. Stay and you will be rewarded with excellent fare, and ocular buffet. Never had rabbit in my life, but I will again. PS. Americans food snobs on a gastronomic holiday."}
{"text":"Pappardelle and salad was delicious. Wines by the glass had a very limited selection. We felt as if we were sitting in someone's basement or bad diner. Very, very loud."}
{"text":"Beau petit restaurant très stylé avec une ambiance très tamisée dans un coin un peu en retrait de la Petite Bourgogne. La déco et vintage et la clientèle est jeune. Idéal pour une date ou une sortie a 4 personnes. Évitez le bar qui est très étroit et les tabourets n'ont pas de dossiers. La cuisine est italienne mais plutôt axée sur les viandes que la sauce tomate. La cuisine est très bonne mais manque tout de même d'originalité. Ce n'est pas gastronomique, la présentation est ordinaire, par contre c'est savoureux et bien préparé. Belle grande carte des vins qui débutes à 46$ jusqu'à 100+$. On aimerait des ingrédients plus surprenants et une plus grande places aux légumes dans les plats principaux, peu d'options pour les végétariens. Très bon service."}
{"text":"FINALLY! After multiple attempts at scheduling a dinner date at Nora Gray, the stars finally aligned and off we went. 

Location: I guess you can call it Griffintown. It's on St. Jacques in a residential area and unless you know it's there, easy to walk by. Bonus? No problem finding parking. 

Food: Holy Mother of all things delectable and delicious! Loved every single thing that I had. The menu is varied and offers up fresh cuisine using seasonal ingredients. If you go in with a large appetite, you can work your way through their three-course menu. On my end, I had to skip the Primi to leave room for dessert! We had:

Antipasti:
Mozzarella w/fried eggplant - I generally don't like eggplant but really enjoyed this. It was almost like eating thickly cut chips. These weren't greasy or oily at all, and the mozzarella was amazingly fresh and soft.

Prosciutto w/fresh basil and peaches: Again, something I don't usually eat, but I did Not regret my choice. The prosciutto was melt-in-my-mouth delicious and the melange of peach and basil was absolutely perfect. This dish isn't on their regular menu.

Primi: We skipped this course but they had some delectable options that included spaghetti w/shrip, orange and pistachio,  and Busiate w/tuna, peas and mint. You can order half or full-sized portions. I think the idea here, is to order the half and treat it as a second appetizer. 

Secondi:
Halibut w/fresh corn polenta, green onion and bacon. My date ordered this and loved it. The halibut was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the portion was pretty generous. 

Lemon sausage w/crushed potatoes  and zucchini chips. Again, something I don't normally eat (sausage) but I was so intrigued by the idea of a lemon sausage that I went ahead and ordered this dish. The sausage is homemade with pork, rabbit and zest of lemon. I was worried it might be a little dry but this wasn't the case at all. The sausage was served in a tightly wound spiral and was moist and so damn good. The crushed potatoes had a lovely flavor and the chips were perfectly cooked. The remaining sausage juice (that sounds bad, right?) was served over the dish, making the overall experience flavorful and awesome. 

Dessert: 

We tried the homemade doughnut with peach marmalade and either marscarpone or fresh meringue. I really don't remember which of the two it was but I'll go with the marscarpone as it wasn't sweet. I'm generally not a doughnut person but this was SO good! The doughnut was topped with cinnamon brown sugar (I think). It was just so damn good. 

We also tried something-chocolate ganache that was served with berries and coulis (and ice cream). There were three chocolate thing in total, and flavor-wise, this dessert is perfect for chocolate lovers. The only thing that I found annoying was that they were bloody hard to cut. I had to use two spoons - one to hold down my chocolate and the other to try and cut the pieces off. This is not to say that this dessert wasn't fresh - it was. The texture was just very, very firm :)

Price: It's not cheap - for two people, the total was $166, however bear in mind that we had three glasses of wine and two lattes. I will definitely return, but probably for special occasions or you know, if I win the lotto - then I'll go every week. A definite must if you love great food and a great ambiance. The staff were super friendly and attentive. 

The restaurant is very small - I think it fits about 30 people. It's also a hot spot so call ahead to make a reservation before you go."}
{"text":"This is an exceptional restaurant , with excellent attentive  service. It can get a bit noisy , which is a shame nice there was really good music in the background. An upbeat , upscale casual restaurant. Though the prices weren't low , they were better than most restaurants of this quality have these days. Every course was delicious."}
{"text":"The restaurant smelled of mould. The temperature was too hot. There were bugs in the toilet. The food was below average or so it seemed in the sweltering heat which took away from our dining experience. We have no desire to return."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating at Nora Gray last night and the food is some of the best I have tasted. Everything our group ordered was perfectly cooked - the smoked rabbit melted in your mouth, the beef cheek fell apart just as it should, and the octopus was tender and delicious. The wine list was extensive and the cocktails  creative. What topped our experience off was that both the hostess and server were extremely attentive and knowledgable. I look forward to coming back here next time I am in Montreal and encourage you to treat yourself to this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"I feel bad writing bad reviews but I do think feedback is valuable and I don't know how to give bad feedback directly to a server yet so I'm writing it here. I may have experienced this place on an off night but my impression is that the restaurant is just kind of overrated. 

I really liked the vibe which was quite warm and intimate, with heart felt 80s music playing. A tad too stuffed. Waiters were kind of struggling to get around our table to serve people in the corner and I was conscious of the inconvenience of my position for most of the night. Our drinks were standout although I had never tried a Rosita before so I don't think my opinion on them is worth much. The server who brought them to us was genuinely warm and friendly. 

The food was relatively underwhelming and generic. It didn't really stand out to me. At times it felt like the chef didn't have any self control when making it, like they were just dumping as many savory flavors into a dish as you could fit and topping it all off with a bunch of gravy or sauce. Heavy and quite concentrated, salty and the flavors all kind of blended together instead of being distinguishable from one another. A friend did point out to me that this could just be the fact that it's Italian food. Despite this however, I feel like the dishes could have been a little more creative and unique in flavor but they weren't and I felt like I could recreate a decent amount of them at home. One thing I thought was creative was the flavor of the steak - smokey kind of like a campfire but again with the seeming lack of self control it was just way too strong and overwhelmed the other parts of the dish. I didn't like the fact that the quail was battered and fried too. The service was what you would expect from an average restaurant nothing really standout, the waiters were nice and didn't forget to refill water but it took a long time for us to be seated and for our server to first come by.

I wouldn't recommend this place and I don't think it was worth the price at all."}
{"text":"If I could sum up Nora Gray in two words it'd simply be \"flawless execution\". As a sister restaurant of Joe Beef, Nora Gray delivers an elegant, delicious, comfortable, no frills dining experience that leaves you satisfied every time in the same way you might expect of a trusted brand(or a game of thrones episode). Ultimately, this might seem like a pricy place($110, two people with appetizers, mains and dessert) to many, but the price is what you pay for that guarantee of quality and consistency.  

As it is, Nora Gray serves Italian food, and you won't expect anything too experimental or anything too avant garde as they try to stick to rustic roots. Go with the bread as once you get it you can ask for more ENDLESSLY! This makes it great if you want to sop up any leftover rich sauces that are left on your mains.

To finalize, Nora Gray left me hungry for more, you can't wait until your next visit as the menu changes seasonally and regularly."}
{"text":"This review is a 4.5 stars in which I rounded down. 
We had an exceptional dining experience! It was Tuesday night, we came with no reservation but fortunately they had a table. The atmosphere was perfect for date night: dim, cozy and comfortable. The servers were knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. They answered all our odd questions! Couldn't take well lit photos, but honestly I couldn't wait to try the food.

For starters, we got the bread, and the fish tartar. I was disappointed that they did not offer bread anyways, as most Italian restaurants would. The tartar was delicious, with the sea urchin mayonnaise, accompanied with fresh herbs to cut through the richness. Next, we got a completo sized goat cheese gnocchi. The homemade ham, chanterelle mushrooms and fresh cheese really gave it a wonderful flavour. The main, halibut with asparagus was well executed as well. For dessert, we got the Neapolitan ice cream cake. 

The food was delicious, but for the price we paid I was hoping for a wow factor. Nonetheless, this restaurant lives up to its reputation."}
{"text":"Buena comida italiana, excelente ambiente. 
El cordero es muy bueno, además de una variada carta de vinos italianos."}
{"text":"My boyfriend looooved the Cornish hen and he's usually such a tough critic. The lemon rotolo was tasty but the half portion was like an appetizer so if you're hungry get the full portion. The decor was  nice and server was good. Glass of Moscato was very small pour. I gave 4 stars because the Cornish hen and service was good."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place a lot.  From the photos the food looked amazing.  We made 10:30 reservations which we made same day so I guess you don't need to wait a week to get reservations as others have stated.  We got the prawn special appetizer and the focaccia to start.  The prawn was juicy, but the focaccia kind of fell flat for me... it was basically cold bread with a side of hot peppers in oil; the olive oil it was served with was pretty good.  We then got the half portions of the gnudi and the pappardelle pasta.  The gnudi was really flavorful and soft and absolutely delectable.  The pappardelle was a served with crab but crab still in its shell.  So you had to claw out the meat yourself which was kind of annoying.  For entrees we got the stuffed rabbit and the lamb.  The lamb was perfectly cooked and flavorful and the stuffed rabbit: the meat was good the the stuffing is composed of liver and cheese and took a little getting used to.  For dessert we got the polenta cake and the strawberry tart.  Both were good but nothing to really write home about.  The most annoying part about our whole night was this 5 group party that was there.  They were loud and obnoxious.  We asked to be moved away from them, which they did, but because the place is kind of small, you could hear them from across the way.  The place is set up with dim lighting with an intimate flair, so I was surprised even though our waiter acknowledged that this group was being loud they never asked them to quiet it down.  The whole ambiance was just ruined."}
{"text":"Overall it was a great experience. I took my parents to Nora Grey for some nouveau Italian after hearing good things about it.

The minimalist decor was very soothing to me and the service attentive and warm. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about all the dishes on the menu.

All three main dishes were perfectly executed, perfectly. I felt that the two starters lacked a bit of something. Don't get me wrong, they were good, just not \"wow\" good.

I would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Italian restaurants are quite common, and few blow me away like Nora Gray. They are authentic down to their decor: basically the vibe of a grandmother's basement kitchen and dining room. Their food, pastas, and sauces are fresh, flavourful, and offer that warm and fuzzy feeling that is expected from traditional Italian food."}
{"text":"From start to finish, this was one of the most exceptional meals we've had all year. The ingredients could not have been fresher and the preparation was nothing short of expert. The space is cozy but vibrant and loud, the wine list is thoughtfully curated, and the service attentive and very friendly. Though all of our food was amazing, the squid ink pasta with lobster sausage in a bisque was out of this world. We'd never had anything like it. Get ready for a treat if you're lucky enough to snag a table!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discovered Nora Gray on a show that was about Joe Beef restaurant. We saw that the owner from Joe Beef dined at Nora Gray and we loved the food from Joe Beef so we decided to give it a try. 

All of the dishes that we ordered was a hit for us. Every single bite of the food that we had was a party in our mouth! We had the chorizo tortellini soup and the baked seafood dish to start and it was delicious. I have to say that even though the portion was small we couldn't even complain because it that good. For my main dish I ordered the mozzarella tomato pasta dish and my boyfriend ordered the duck ravioli. Both main dishes had amazing flavours. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves fine dining Italian food. Nora Gray is a hidden gem in Montreal."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been opened for 7 weeks now so it was the perfect time to try it. Made a RSVP at the bar for 7 pm on a Friday night. It has been packed every night since they have been open, which is from tue to sat. 
The service was amazing. We were greeted by fresh bread with the most amazing olive oil, which I normal never have since most of restaurant serve old/ bad olive oil. Theirs was amazingly fresh!!! 
We had rabbit pate and porcini risotto balls, they were amazing and filling! Our main course was the quails and black cod, which was just perfectly cook! The flavors were all there, really! The hunter sauce of the quail was quite something!
After describing what type of wine I like to Ryan, he recommended a 2003 Bandole which was right on! We were off to a good start! It just made our night much better! Emma, the chef, came to visit us couple times and gave us some great recommendations. 
Would definitely recommend it to everyone who wants great fantastic simple tasty food with a casual yet cozy and chic atmosphere.
Run and try it! :)

PS i heard that the name of the restaurant was named after Emma's grandma's name, pretty cool!

PPS they have 1/2 portion available so you can taste more plates! Tapas style kinda."}
{"text":"I loved the food!  My mom and I shared two primi dishes and one secondi plus the focaccia.  The crab pappardelle had more crab meat than I expected.  It was so tender and came easily out of the shell.  The calamari stuffed with shrimp risotto was delicious. The calamari was not rubbery, there was plenty of shrimp and the risotto was not heavy.  For the quality of food, the price was really reasonable.  Too bad we were too full for dessert!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Impeccable service and average food.

I went in excited for one of the pasta dishes I saw online, but the pasta menu at the restaurant differed from the one online.
I was still happy because there was a beautiful chestnut and rabbit ragu one. Unfortunately, my dreams of a soft, smooth, and hearty chestnut were squashed when I bit into a crunchy flavourless water chestnut. 

The dishes we ate were good, but not outstanding considering all the hype surrounding the restaurant. We did enjoy the bread, but anything from Hof Kelsten is delectable.

Despite the lacklustre food, the service was impeccable. Our waitress was a huge sweetheart. Everything was served in a timely fashion and we never went thirsty. 

We all agreed at the end of the meal that the none of us had a desire to return.


Please note: I wrote this review in May and forgot to click post."}
{"text":"Very nice wine by the glass selection as well as original cocktails.
Food was delicious! Love the italian style menu with appeteizer (first) - pasta (second) - main (third). Highlights were the sweetbread and the rabbit tagliatelle. The boar was truly delicious but 43$ for a piece of about 10-12oz is a bit over priced. As for the ambiance, it was hip but the noise level got pretty loud very fast- so good for small group of friends, not so great for intimate couple (unless you sit at the bar which puts the both of you in closer contact and further from the main noise)."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Nora Grey, but I don't think they were fully met. Loved the antipasti and primi, the secondi were questionable. We started with cocktails, the Old Fashioned was masterfully executed. They didn't have my Tagliattela and I ended up trying the Cedro Bramble, which was too icy, so icy that my lips were burning because of the cold, I guess a straw would have helped in that case. The zucchini flowers stuffed with sausage were divine and the squid filled with risotto complemented the absolute happiness we experienced with the appetizers. The primi are offered in two sizes and we shared parpadelle with snow crab, which was extremely good. The variations of the tomato sauce in any of these dishes were amazing as well. My scallops were perfectly seared, I only couldn't figure out why the peas and pancetta had to float in a transparent liquid in my dish. Every time i would cut a scallop it will inevitably soak in that liquid and its beautiful taste will be lost. My sweet heart got a squab that we found undercooked. The deserts were nothing to write about either, I could have made the same and even better. The wine list of Nora Grey is impressive, we decided to order wine by the glass so we can try different things and the recommendations for digestive from our hostess were outstanding. Overall nice experience, but when I come next time would definitely focus on  appetizers and the home made pasta!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome from start to finish.  I was fortunate enough to sit at the bar and allow Ryan to pick and choose our food and drink. It is an experience and a great one at that. This is one place to put at the top of your list of places to try, great food, great wine, great cocktails and great company."}
{"text":"I preface this with the assumption that it may have been an off day. 

I use Eater to research my culinary adventures, Nora Gray has been on many of their lists for quite some time so when there was an open reservation available, we snatched it.

Service - 3.5 - We were recommended a bottle which they ran out of, which is fine, but our appetizers came before the wine, huge no no (first world problems, I know)

Food - 3 
1. Tortellini soup was under-cooked slightly, needed an additional minute or two
2. Calamari, I've never had it raw, but was slimy and under seasoned. 
3. Meatball, lacks flavor, could only taste the sauce on top, nothing inside, even the par cooked egg inside. (needed salt)
4. Braised short rib - this was the best dish with depth of flavor, texture and technique

Decore - 3.5 very dark, folks a few table over had to use their phones to read the menu.

Wine - 4 very good selection w/knowledge staff.

IMO, I'd recommend trying other spots on the Eater list before Nora Gray. Joe Beef, HVOR, Le Fantome etc. come to mind."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place and was really excited to try it. Despite my high expectations, I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant has a cozy feeling and perfect if you want to spend intimate quality time with your friends or for a date.

I ordered Trotter croquettes, pickles and peach mostarda and wow! So flavorful. Then came the sardines, cooked to perfection and very fresh and tasty. My friend had the sea bream that also was cooked to perfection. Everything was mindblowing. 

The only downside was that the first dishes took a long time before coming out. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"VIBE 
Wow. Nora Gray...what do I say? The ambiance reminds me of what Black Hoof was back when they started. It's a bit bare bones with wood paneling, a few pictures on the wall, some comfy booths and a great bar (which is where we sat). It's the warmth of the staff and the rustic food made with love that really made our meal stand out. 

WE ATE 
From blood orange and beet salad to  tarragon rabbit ravioli to our sea bream for two served in a container shaped like a fish, our meal was one of those perfect Saturday night meals. The fish was incredible - salted perfectly and lots of lemon on the side for flavour made me feel like I was in Sicily (let's forget that it was over minus 20 Celsius in Montreal!). 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Nothing \"gray\" about this meal! This is definitely a spot to bring a group of friends or have a few drinks and an app before heading on a Montreal resto hop. It really does feel like going over to a friend's house for a kick-ass dinner."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and a very helpful staff made this restaurant a highlight!"}
{"text":"Fuck. My. Gullet. 

Nora Gray is one of the best restaurants in Montreal. Here's why: 

1) The menu is a living organism, constantly evolving and getting arguably better with each passing season. 

2) The wine list is as distinct as it is comprehensive. Every bottle is vetted by their sommelier, which leads me to believe that their sommelier is a MENSA level genius. 

3) The service is top notch and the staff know what the they're talking about. 

4) It's such a cozy spot that you could fall asleep there. And they probably wouldn't even mind because they're wonderful people.

Pro Tip: Sit at the bar. It's the best spot in the house."}
{"text":"The food here was really good, five star good. So why the 3 stars? Several things: no separate bills, small portions/overpriced, and too dark and hot inside.

We came last weekend as a big group of 6 couples to celebrate a friend's birthday. We started off with a few rounds of drinks, and then shared a whole slew of appetizers, including the crab, asparagus with egg, pork belly and morels, and buratta with spring veggies. Everything was en pointe and bursting with flavour.

For my main course, I really wanted to try the pasta but could not decide between two choices, so I opted for both. I ordered the mezzo/half-plate for each of the ricotta tortellini and the crab pappardelle. When the dishes arrived, my tortellini order had FOUR pieces of pasta on it ($14). Don't get me wrong, the dish was creamy and rich, and while the mint complemented the richness perfectly...it was $3.50 per tortellino?? You've got to be kidding me. The pappardelle ($17) was equally good, but again, small portion and skimpy on the crab. For pasta, which is not expensive to make, I was expecting a much bigger portion size.

My husband had the pan-seared halibut. Very buttery in flavour, well-cooked (perhaps just a tad overdone) and well-seasoned. It was a small piece of fish that came with several radishes and baby asparagus on the side. It was only filling if you possessed a small appetite and had eaten several appetizers beforehand. So, luckily we were okay.

Imagine our delight when the server arrived with a single big honking bill that said ten beers ($100), three halibuts ($96), eight cappuccinos ($64),etc. it was not clear which couple had ordered what. She politely apologized but refused to break down the bill per couple because \"we have a really old machine.\" For nearly $900, you would think the restaurant would be a little more accommodating.

After our friend spent a good 20 minutes breaking down the bill, we finally figured out that we owed $77 (basically $100 including tax and tip) for just one beer, one espresso, and our small entrees (i.e. the apps were generously covered by someone else in the party). Several other friends were also a bit miffed at their pricey bills, but by then the room had become so stiflingly hot that everyone paid as quickly as they could so we could get the heck out of there. We were all sweating. The ambience inside was fine, but very dim so you couldn't read the menu, and of course, no AC.

I would consider coming back *if and when* they fix their cash register and increase their portion sizes. Until then, I will be open to trying many of the other fabulous restos that Montreal has to offer."}
{"text":"10/10 best restaurant in Montreal. Small space and attentive staff. Someone named Jula or Julip recommended the Aperola Fresca, it was perfect for me  my water glass was never empty, and there was no one rushing us to order or leave!! A guy named Luca (I think) was pretty awesome he recommended the more aesthetic washroom for me to take pics in! Best food I've ever tasted!! Also they were making a new focaccia bread that was even better than the hof kelsten they usually serve! Please take your grandmas and your friends here  we loved it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chili pappardelle with snow crab, which was a really interesting and fun dish though I thought the seasoning was a little off (no other pronounced flavours to balance off the heat). I also had the appetizer of confit tomatoes, pesto and cheese which was delicious. Unfortunately I got food poisoning from this place. As in literally sick all night after only eating there. For that alone I can not recommend the food (or the seafood) at all since this is the first time I've gotten this sick from eating at a place. The service was good though, and they have an extensive wine selection. I would recommend this place for a nice cocktail and wine."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. I was expecting more from this well known Italian restaurant however that's what I have to say. Rabbit with anchovies was a joke. The customer next to our table ordered the same one but he sent it back. So I had a bad feeling but tried. Big mistake. Rabbit was already really gamy, that being said plus nuke warm anchovies was disaster. We did not sent it back. Well just not going again. The guy next to us said \"that was brutal\". Does not worth he price for sure. We also ordered a flatbread with mushroom, the bread was hard but soggy, mushroom had least flavor. A glass of wine I ordered was also off taste."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of great things about this place, I wasn't particularly impressed by it. I managed to get a reservation for 4 on a Wednesday at 7:30pm by calling the day before. 

Though we were excited to finally get to try Nora Gray, the majority of the dishes weren't particularly impressive. My halibut was served on a bed of lentils and was minimally seasoned to allow the natural flavours of the fish to shine through, but it wasn't particularly mind-blowing. In particular, my friends weren't particularly impressed with their rabbit parmesan, noting that the heavy cheese and sauce completely overshadowed the meat. That said, their gnocchi was pretty amazing, having been cooked well with just the right amount of creaminess. I probably would've been happier with a full order of this for myself.

Service-wise, the wait-time between courses was quite lengthy. However, the servers were thoughtful enough to continue refilling our waters as the long, idle periods meant a lot of thoughtless water-drinking. 

Overall, perhaps I'm not giving Nora Gray enough credit where credit's due, but this seemed to be another instance in which hype overshadowed my experience at a popular restaurant. Parenthetically, a highlight of the night was spotting Chris North (of Sex and the City fame) dining at a table not too far away from us. Guess we're in good company, at least."}
{"text":"I had first heard of Nora Gray from Lesley Chesterman's review in The Montreal Gazette last February. I made note of it and put it on the quite lengthy \"places to go\" list. Fast forward one year later and Nora Gray had become one of my most anticipated restaurants to check out. Luckily, I was finally able to enjoy a Friday night dinner there a few weeks ago with my family.

Walked into the approximately 50 seat space and right away loved the look of the room. Chic and modern with wood paneled walls, dark banquettes, black and white frames, dimmed lighting and a beautiful looking bar that I would love to spend hours at. Add to that the great alternative music that I became aware of over the course of the dinner and you have a space that certainly appeals to my sensibilities. This is a restaurant that screams timeless classics but with a young and hip touch.

As for the menu, it changes regularly and if I had to characterize it, I would say it is one of Italian influences but certainly not one shackled by what one expects from a typical Italian joint. To start off with, given co-owner Ryan Gray's reputation as a sommelier and knower of things cocktail and spirits, I started with their \"My Buddy Frankie\" - Maker's Mark, Campari and Vergano Mauro Vermouth. Very nice and balanced cocktail although if you don't like Campari, I probably wouldn't recommend it as that is the spirit that comes out the most. The wine list is mostly French and Italian which is not our family's forte however our waitress was quite helpful in recommending some options for us and both selections she brought forth were enjoyed by all of us. Ryan also came by to see if we had any other questions about the wine list which was appreciated.

As appetizers, we started with the rabbit liver pâté with caramelized onions on top of housemade cornbread. This was a great dish - a perfect combination of everything you would like to have - the richness of the rabbit liver with the sweetness of the onions and the warm cornbread. Definitely something I would eat again...and again... and again. This was a one of those dishes where, after eating it, I went \"I now want to try making this at home so others can try the combination\".

The next entree was grilled octopus with spicy red pepper sauce. Very nice again. The octopus was grilled perfectly and the sauce added a little kick to the whole dish.

The final entree was crispy sweetbreads with honey and horseradish served on a bed of crispy spinach. Now, sweetbreads is something that often automatically turns people off and I get it. However, when cooked and prepared properly, sweetbreads are a wonderful treat to enjoy. Nora Gray's version is along those lines. By frying them, it creates a nice crispy texture to pair with the softer interior. The touch of honey brings a great sweetness that mixed nicely with the naturally fatty and earthy tones of sweetbreads. The crispy spinach was perfectly done as well.

Two mains were ordered amongst our party since a few redundancies took place between the 4 of us. The first one was the chick pea hot pot. I personally didn't try it but my sister rather enjoyed it. The chick peas were of the right consistency and the whole thing had a nice basil taste to it.

I ordered as a main the porchetta with potato and broccoli cake. In Nora Gray's version, the roast was stuffed with pork and veal. The roast was just perfectly cooked. The interior was soft and moist whereas the exterior skin was golden crispy. Rich and delicious in every way. Under the roast, the potato and broccoli cake was a nice contrast to the fattiness of the pork and veal. Very good plate across the board.

Next up were the desserts. First up, the ricotta tort with blood orange. Exactly as rich as you expect with something based primarily out of ricotta. The blood orange added a very distinguished citrus note to it. Very well done.

The flourless chocolate cake was quite good as well. No complaints here. 

The one miss of the evening was the Concorde grape jelly. The execution was spot-on. The jelly had exactly the right texture however the flavour really didn't step up like we would have hoped. The only negative in an otherwise amazing meal.

Nora Gray was a great experience that lived up to everything I had hoped it would be since I placed it on my to-go list over a year ago. The service was friendly and very timely. They were also quite understanding when I called ahead to say we would be late by 20 mins or so. They simply thanked us for the notice and mentioned to us that there was a reservation after us so we would not have as much time to eat by arriving a little late. Despite that, they never rush us and we left quite satisfied and of our own accord well before the next party arriving. I would have no reservations whatsoever recommending this place to anyone... 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall restaurant on st. Jacque! Small bar and dining area.. The booths were rich black leather, wood panels on the walls, and the entire restaurant is lit by candles.. All to say, a great calm atmosphere, not too loud either!
The food was good, we tried antipasto, 1st and second! The tastiest by far were the pastas (home made)!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Very enjoyable pasta dishes - small enough to order a few samples (which I like). I had their steak main (for two I think) and thought that was good too. Small venue with an intimate feel. I'd place Nora Gray near the top of Montreal resto options (slightly below the cream of the crop - like Bouillon Bill)."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure why this place is categorized as Italian. If you are thinking of eating here do not hesitate. This is the Mecca of progressive cuisine. I ate at the bar and felt like I was sitting in a living room in an ultra cool speakeasy. 
Hand crafted cocktails started the evening perfectly. This is a dining experience. Choose wisely. The menu changes with the seasons. I'm not going to go on about what I ate. A Great restaurant is not about the individual dishes. It's about how it all weaves together like a fine fabric to create an incredible dining experience. Nora Gray is that experience. Don't hesitate."}
{"text":"One word to describe Nora Gray is \"excellent\". The service - excellent. The restaurant was small, and the atmosphere was very elegant and ambiance was perfect for a date night which was what we were looking for. Ryan, the sommelier, was excellent and came over to us and introduced himself. We ordered the grilled broccoli app, rabbit bolognese (still drooling), the Red wine braised boar with fried potatoes and wild mushrooms (so good) and a mezzo of the chestnut agnolotti which was, yes - excellent."}
{"text":"I don't normally review a restaurant after just one meal. But I don't normally have a near-perfect experience at a restaurant, either. Suffice to say that dinner at Nora Gray was the highlight of a weekend in Montreal.

On a dreary night, we entered a cozy room and were whisked to seats at the bar. But not before we were aware that everyone was happy. The dining room was packed with folks who were having a good time, eating really delicious food, and enjoying their cocktails and wine.

As we were about to learn, the menu at Nora Gray isn't large, but there wasn't a single choice on it that I wouldn't have eaten and been happy. I ordered seared rabbit liver as my appetizer: it was perfectly cooked, seared and crispy on the outside and medium rare inside, served over a mushroom ragu packed with chanterelles. I followed that with a pork chop over stewed borlotti beans and roasted cherry tomatoes. Not what I'd usually order, but i couldn't  resist. The pork chop was tender and, again, perfectly cooked. My wife ordered cavatelli -- scrumptious.

The wine list isn't large, but it's packed with great wines, many at very reasonable prices. We were really pleased to order a bottle of a frappato and nero d'avola blend from Andrea Occhipinti, a sensational Sicilian winemaker. And there's a terrific selection of amaros for after dinner.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the friendly and attentive service at Nora Gray -- even on a Saturday night. And even though the restaurant was full, it wasn't too loud: we could still talk to each other comfortably during our meal."}
{"text":"Food here is over rated. They are okay, small quantity and very pricy. Given so many great choices at more reasonable price in this area, I'm not coming back."}
