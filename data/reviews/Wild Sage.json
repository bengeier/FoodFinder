{"text":"Despite the cramped seating this place is amazing. The food was as advertised and delicious with very friendly staff. A great local restaurant."}
{"text":"We moved to the area a few months ago, and I'm looking forward to this restaurant becoming our local Go To celebratory spot.  My husband picked up a takeout order and we enjoyed the scallops and the sun-dried tomato pasta, although both dishes were a tad bit saltier than if we were cooking at home. I enjoyed the food more than some of the higher rated places in the trendier parts of the city."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.  Excellent variety on the menu.  Had the Wild Sage burger and i must say it is one of the best burgers I've had in a long time.  I will definitely be returning to try out some of the other diverse menu items.  I would definitely recommend stopping in and checking it out.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area visiting relatives for the holidays.  We had the chance to go out for a \"grown up\" dinner last night while the grandparents watched the kids.  Last year we went downtown but I found Wild Sage on Yelp and liked that it was less than a mile away.  And I loved the menu options...not a boring item to be found!

Wild Sage was easy to find and parking was no problem.  When we arrived there was just one group of women sitting at the bar. The owner greeted us right away and gave us the cozy table for two in the corner.  Before we knew it, almost all the tables were full...on a Tuesday night!

We started out by sharing the Goat Cheese and Pear Salad and the Lobster Crepe - both very good choices.  The salad had ample crumbled goat cheese and candied pecans on a bed of crisp spring mixed greens.  And the crepe was stuffed with sweet lobster in a sauce that was rich, but not overly so, with sautéed red onion strips on top. We sopped that sauce up with the fresh bread that had been provided to us...it was too good to just leave it there.  The plate was sent back nearly clean.

For entrees, he had the Osso Bucco and I had the Braised Beef Short Ribs.  He called his the \"Flintstone Dinner\" because the pork shank was huge!  The meat fell off the bone and combined perfectly with the penne in a flavorful red sauce.  My beef was tender and rich with flavor.  I expected the accompanying polenta to be in a pile like mashed potatoes or sliced but instead it was long, thin triangles that must have been pan fried to a light crisp on the outside with a creamy center.  They were a bit salty, but other than that they were quite delicious.

I couldn't even finish my meal but I was dying to try the creme brulee.  I was warned that it wouldn't be pretty if I took it To Go because it would have to be scooped out of the dish...and she was right.  But it was SO good anyway.  There were bits of crispy, sugary burnt top mixed in with the creamy, smooth interior.  They had divided it up into two little containers...one for me, one for my Mother in Law who was home watching our kids.  Letting her have the second serving after I had had mine was one of the most difficult things to do.  I *really* didn't want to share that awesomeness!

Sorry I don't have pictures to share...we kept diving in to our dishes as soon as they were set down...! It wasn't a quick dinner but that's not what we were looking for.  It was a very pleasant atmosphere...unrushed, not too loud, European decor, lights were dimmed but it wasn't dark, very welcoming overall.  Jenn, the owner/hostess/waitress had at least 8 tables to take care on her own but she was always on top of it all.  She checked on us often and I could see her constantly looking over the room to make sure everyone was happy.  

Two negatives: 1) the reviews here include mentions/pictures of menu items that are no longer available that I would have loved to have tried (but there were still so many options that we took forever to make our choices) and 2) it's six hours from our house. But we will be back next time we are in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Last night we went to Wild Sage for dinner. Because of the holiday, there was a prefix menu, but it was delicious. Service was great, diverse wine and beer selections, and the food was amazing. We can't wait to go back and see what else they have to offer!! 

Don't let the outside fool you on this one, it is a wonderfully cozy and rustic atmosphere."}
{"text":"I nice casual yet upscale place right on Rt. 8
Small and open. Came here for lunch so not a large crowd at 1pm. I are here and took away because it was too difficult to decide on the various menu items. I'll come back for dinner the next time im in town."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE their Reubens.  Without a doubt I've never had a better one.  I try to order other lunch items from the menu but can't seem to control myself.  Of course, the corned beef is prepared in house.  Their hand cut fries are also great.  Not soggy like I've eaten elsewhere.   For dinner, my all time favorite has been the scallops, but a close second is the pear salad, which I have had plain and with shrimp.   Will try it with chicken in the future."}
{"text":"Always excellent fish daily specials, wonderful new in-house BBQ offerings. Caring & attentive waitstaff. A great gem & addition to the neighborhood. Thanks for being here! JB"}
{"text":"Everything is great but try the soup.  Sherry mushroom bisque, red pepper bisque, sweet carrot bisque just a for example.  They are excellent.  Can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"The food and service are simply outstanding.   They have a nice selection of wines and a very cute outdoor patio.  Have been here several times now and have never been disappointed.  I would most definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"First trip to Wild Sage on the night before Valentine's Day. A limited menu was offered, only @ 7 entrees. We arrived at 7, waitress took our order at 7:22 and we received our soup and salad at 7:35. Dinner didn't arrive until 8:20, almost 1 1/2 hours after we arrived. The braised short ribs were very tender, but the sweet potato mouse was merely a smear and the fried polenta was basically a square of cornbread. No reason for such a delay as everything was clearly pre-made and not to order. And, for $29, we felt that the price clearly exceeded the quality of the product. We didn't order dessert because who knows how long that would have taken. Don't think that we'll return. There are too many other good restaurants in town. Too bad because the Allison Park/Gibsonia area is truly in need of a few good, non-chain restaurants."}
{"text":"First time here!  Great ambience, great wine, delicious scallops and Caprese flatbread.   Will definitely come again!!!  You have got to try this place!!"}
{"text":"My wife received a gift certificate for WS for her birthday so we decided to try it out.  She tried the hamachi (fish) which was less than fresh and very overcooked.  I tried the salmon roulades which were also less than fresh, overcooked and the crab stuffing was heavy on the breading and even heavier on the garlic!  Not sure why there was even garlic in this dish to start with?  The service was good but could never make up for the poor quality and preparation of the food.

Pittsburgh is getting to be a \"foodier\" town and it's pallets are more educated and refined.  WS needs to rework a few things if it's going to make it in this exciting new environment."}
{"text":"First time here. I was blown away! Not only was the menu selection diverse but every entree that our party selected was done to perfection. I've been to many up scale restaurants where the food was over priced and under cooked. This is NOT one of them. The owners and staff were very friendly and professional. Although this restaurant is relatively new, I have no doubt it will thrive. A very enjoyable evening!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing anniversary dinner here. Walked in to a custom table top decorated with hearts and a beautiful bouquet of flowers. They have an amazing selection of wine which we enjoyed. 

For appetizers we had The Bone Marrow & also The Wings. Both were exceptional, the wings were tossed in an amazing sauce. 

For dinner I had the Filet. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was very good! My wife had the pasta bolignese and said it was very good as well.

For dessert we split a Creme Brûlée, and once again just like the apps & our main course it was delicious. I will certainly be returning to Wild Sage!"}
{"text":"We heard from a friend that they enjoyed this restaurant.  On our way home from the mall and decided to give it a try. So much nicer inside than what you would expect. Service great and a delicious dinner. The pecan crusted chicken was amazing and the presentation was beautiful. 
The same was true with the scallops. A great find."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!! The service, the food...everything!!!  I travel for work and love to find a place off the beaten path.  The menu is very diverse, something for everyone.  I enjoyed it so much I had lunch there every day last week...it's that good.  Some of the wonderful food I've had so far....BBQ ribs (very meaty and great flavor...dammit I'm from MEMPHIS I know ribs), the Cuban sandwich, the Sage burger... but wait, what changed my damn life was the BBQ egg rolls (Yes Lawd!!!)it is so flavorful.  I'm actually on my way to get some today.  Haha! Great people!!! They made me feel welcomed and it was real...nothing fake about this place.  If you haven't been, get there!!!"}
{"text":"Went there last night and had the scallops. They were fabulous. I highly recommend the \"new style\" which uses a sweet teryaki glaze and a wasabi drizzle that somehow works so well with the delicate flavor of the scallops without being overwhelming."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been eyeing this place for months. We finally stopped in recently for a weeknight date. It is a cute little building. Small dining area and it appeared as though there was only one waitress for the entire place. Every table was full, so service was verrrry slow. It took 10 minutes to get a menu once we sat down, 10 more to get water, then it was probably close to 25 minutes before we even ordered.
Other than the waiting, we had a great meal! The prices were reasonable and the food was delicious. I loved the sausage ricotta flatbread I had. The atmosphere is nice enough to feel like a night out, but you can still see the bar TVs well enough from a lot of the tables to watch a game that's on if that is your thing.  Hope to go back again!"}
{"text":"I took my wife here for a Valentine's Day eve dinner which was a special menu for the celebration.  (I was particularly interested in the halibut entree which is a favorite of my wife.) We were met at the door by the owner who took our coats and whisked up off to our table.  Shortly thereafter we were greeted by our server, Lisa.  She was a  lovely, attentive and efficient young lady!  Our first and second course came in rapid succession and just as described.  And now on to the entrees.  My wife ordered the halibut (no surprise here!) with a special request which was graciously handled by the chef. She enjoyed it thoroughly!  Also she was able to pair it with her favorite wine from their list. I ordered the filet.  It was quite sizable and cooked to perfection  I enjoyed mine as well!  Dessert for her was carrot cake and for me a pecan ball which I have not had in ages.  I'm glad it was on the menu!  And on top of all this the owner dropped by our table for a chat or two.  What a nice touch!  All in all, my wife and I had a great time and will most certainly make it a point to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing meal... best I have had in the area in a very  long time.  We had the bone marrow appetizer - superb!  Caesar salads for the whole table.  We tried the Filet au poivre, pork shank and burgers - all were delicious. Great food, fantastic presentation and wonderful service.  Will absolutely go back again!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I live 10 minutes from Wild Sage and had dinner there for the first time last evening. A fabulous meal with perfectly paced service. We wondered why we waited three months to try it. We will definitely be back; regularly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a good idea with petty bad execution. They didn't have several of the wines on their wine list in stock. We got the appetizer special, which would have been good except for being very cold in the center. Our dinners looked good, but they left the string on my meal. They came to the table and cut it off with scissors.

The flavors were okay. The concept and atmosphere was nice. But it's no wonder the place is empty all the time. Poor execution."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here a few days ago. We both work in the service industry so it was our Valentines dinner. The food was very good and very reasonably priced. Our server did a great job! I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant! My advice, try the duck terrine it was awesome! Thanks folks for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Definitely something I would recommend if you're looking for a nice, upscale dinner but with a comfortable environment. The restaurant itself is quaint and cozy. The staff was very friendly and well-versed on the menu. 

Portion size was actually very decent for the price. Not a load of food like at the Cheesecake Factory but enough to keep you content. Definitely would recommend the \"Bone Marrow Appetizer\" if you want to try something unique... yes, you read that right. It's bone marrow from a cow! Crazy good actually when you spread it on the included crostini's. 

*PLUS: complimentary WARM bread with butter."}
{"text":"Just stopped here for their Italian porchetta sidewalk sandwich and was blown away. I am really big into bbq (smoke my own meats and make my own sauces) and I have to say that this was one of the best bbq sandwiches I have ever had. The meat was the perfect melt in your mouth tenderness and their house made sauces are legit. I recommend putting their house bbq sauce on top of the sandwich as well as the sharp provolone they offer and get some of their mustard bbq sauce on the side to dip. They are offering these sandwiches right in the parking lot every Friday so even if you're in a hurry you can grab one. I will be stopping every week. Awesome sandwich guys."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a rainy Tuesday night and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was quaint and very nicely decorated. I would consider this casual upscale dining. There wasn't a crowd around 6pm and we were promptly seated. Having never been here before I wasn't sure what to expect. 

I started with their soup of the day, Roasted Red Pepper, and it was phenomenal. Went great with the warm bread they brought out. We ordered the fish tacos as a starter and when they say \"Small Plates\" on the menu, they weren't kidding. We got three bite-sized fish tacos. Very small, but good. Since the soup was fairly filling we ordered the BBQ Trio to share. It was beautifully presented coming with a slice of beef brisket on top of corn bread, 3 BBQ ribs over coleslaw, and BBQ Pulled pork over rice and beans. Of the three, the pulled pork was our favorite. The ribs were decent and the brisket and cornbread were both a little dry for my liking. But when it comes to barbecue, I like A LOT of sauce so maybe I'm just picky. The coleslaw that came with the ribs seemed like more of a garnish than an actual coleslaw. 

Overall, it was a good experience. A lot of the menu items sounded really good so I'd love to go back and try some more! They also have an outdoor patio out back that might be nice on the off chance it isn't raining."}
{"text":"Nice little surprise to walk into a place that is a little more upscale than you might expect considering that Pittsburgh is mostly about pizza, burgers and wings. The lobster crepe was delicious.  The pork chop and risotto were one of the best I've had.  It seems to be a great start for something that is missing from most areas around town."}
{"text":"I like this place. I hope they find success and a comfortable routine. This is one of the best options for contemporary upscale food in the north of Pittsburgh.

I got the ahi tuna, and was a little surprised when the server asked me how I wanted it cooked. I said medium rare, and it was in fact cooked to a perfect medium rare, but I realized afterwards that I should have ordered it rare. I think I'm used to seeing ahi tuna just served rare without an option in its donenes, but I don't think it's unreasonable to offer the choice, except that some people might answer medium! My suggestion for the service of this dish is just that it should be presented with a suggested doneness."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and was very pleased with the meal we had. I have the brisket tacos and my friend had the fish tacos. Hands down the brisket was so much better. The red cabbage was delish. My only complaint was  that I did not have more time to try a full entree. Next time"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise!! A great meal, great staff, in a lovely restaurant! We went on a Friday night with another couple and started with an amazing cheese tray. The most generous portions of 5 very interesting cheeses with beautiful jams and fresh fruit. Then on to the entrees. Chicken, the barbecue trio and the swordfish special... Each one perfectly cooked and executed! I got a small plate of the fish tacos for dinner... Delicious! Then dessert... Creme brûlée and marshmallow cheesecake, both very yummy!! It was a fabulous meal and we can't wait to go back!!! Thanks wild sage for a wonderful evening!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, balanced flavors, and friendly service distinguish this restaurant. All done with an Italian theme 

We knew had had made a good voice when our server brought out warmed rolls and herb butter, fresh dill made the rolls irresistible 
I had the braised short ribs, served over polenta and roasted root veggies. You could cut it with s spoon. My wife had the lamb meatballs with gnocchi. Great homemade pasta! With fresh spring peas.
If your traveling on US 76 and want something more than fast food, drive the 4 or so miles. Well worth the 10 minutes"}
{"text":"First, we chose Wild Sage because we have never been there, but we did frequent Spadafore's in the same location because it is close to our home and the food and service were usually terrific. We also chose Wild Sage for our Valentine's day dinner because of your posted menu online. We were a little disappointed to find a different menu last evening. I understand that finer restaurants commonly do this but my belief is that adding a couple bucks to similar dishes on a 'holiday' menu is a little iffy. We had decided on entrees even before we left the house but fortunately we saw dishes that sounded good on the 'special' menu.

We were seated soon after we arrived for a 7:30 reservation after a table had been bussed. A tall man, I presume the owner. Came over and asked us if we had ever been there before to which we replied 'no, but we came to Spadafore's a lot'. He conveyed to us that he hoped that we had a pleasant experience. The waitress came over a short time later, a young blonde woman, who I reluctantly have forgotten her name, took our wine order. When she brought our drinks and bread she took our order, we both had Caesar salads and the filet. My wife ordered hers medium well and I ordered mine medium rare. We received our salads in good time and although somewhat sparse of romaine or additional ingredients, the presentation was beautiful and the taste was very good, the crusted bread circle was a nice touch. 

We also received our entrees in good time after our salads were finished. I noticed upon cutting into my steak that it seemed slightly over cooked, my wife felt hers was slightly under cooked, so we exchanged them. I believe they were both cooked to medium. However, the taste was pretty good and we both enjoyed our meal. The mashed potatoes were a bit cold however. Regardless, we both had a nice dinner, albeit we felt slightly overpriced. 

The slight issue we had was with service along with the overpricing. Though our waitress was mildly pleasant, she never once came back to the table to see if everything was OK. Not once did she ask us how is the wine, or how are the salads, or how are the filets and were they prepared to order. At the end of our meal she only asked if there would be anything else. Not a 'would you like coffee or dessert'? She brought our check and said thank you, without an 'I'll take that when you're ready'. All with just a slight smile. We wondered if she was having a bad day. I watched another waitress (a petite brunette), throughout our meal and she treated her patrons with extreme politeness, a terrific smile, and attended to them frequently. Our feelings are that a finer restaurant, and by their price structure it seems that's what you are striving for, I would hope to have top quality service from the time we are greeted at the door until we leave. I think our waitress just needs to be better trained and she'll probably do fine. 

At a finer place every aspect of the meal should be a perfect as possible. Meat should be prepared as ordered, not a 'happy medium'. Mashed should not have a slight chill to them. Maybe these details seem too critical for some people but when my wife and I go out to a better restaurant, especially on a day like Valentine's day, we expect top quality from our $100 tab. 

The restaurant was crowded with every table seated but that is not an excuse for a small, intimate place from getting things right. The atmosphere was relaxed enough for our server to pay more attention and our meals to have been perfect. I also understand that nothing is perfect, even the service and food at every table at a nicer restaurant.

As a small business owner myself I would want to know any and every way I could improve my work from my customers. Repeat business is key to sustained success.
As I said, this note is intended to give them feedback in order to improve, and not a request for a compensatory meal. I truly wish Wild Sage restaurant all the future success at this location as it is good to have a better place to eat around the area. We may even come back again, at least after our experience last night recedes in our minds. All in all, it wasn't terrible. It just needed some attention to detail. I would give it 3 out of 5 stars, but hopefully if we do return they will take the steps to earn a 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and relaxing. Nice looking bar and enough tables to be cozy but not crowded. But the service was on the slow to absent side. The food was mediocre. The sides were good but the entree itself was lacking for both my companion and me. Boring fish and dry burger. They were willing to make swaps and substitutions on the menu which was nice. I had a nice glass of wine--I'm glad I didn't want another because it was never offered. I wanted this to be a great little restaurant in the area and I'm disappointed it's not."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the area. Good ambience and food selection. Pasta, sandwiches, salads, flatbreads, bbq, etc. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner! My out of town friends and I ordered and shared all of the following: lobster crepes (so much lobster), bone marrow (buttery with lovely crostini), scallops (literally melted in my mouth), filet (crunchy, wonderfully peppery crust), pecan chicken (sweet and delicious), salmon (stuffed with a fabulous crab meat stuffing), and we ended with a rich and creamy creme brulee. One of the best meals I have eaten in years!"}
