{"text":"OMG THE FOOD WAS SOOOO GOOOD!!!!! I got a Philly cheese steak wrap with chips and salsa, A chicken quesadilla appetizer, and my boyfriend got a cheeseburger with fresh cut fries. All fantastic! New favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I really like this place.  It is nothing to write home about from an interior perspective (dinning room), but the bar area is pretty good.  They have TV's posted in good spots all around.  They do have a large selection of beers (~10) on tap and on Tuesdays they have $2.00 drafts.  They do not sell 200 different micro brews, so if you are a beer snob and feel your pallet needs such attention, this is not the place for you.  It is located between Mantua and nowhere after all.   We have been multiple times and have always found the wait staff to be really nice.  They do get swamped so if you are in a hurry, you may want to lower the 5 guys expectation.  That being said, I have never been there longer than an hour unless I just wanted to.  The food quality and price is really good.  They run daily specials, like Tue $6.00 build your own burger night, with fries and $2 / drafts.  I have also had a great Shrimp basket on Fridays for $7.00 I think.    So if you are looking for linen tablecloths, or exotic beers keep moving on.  If you are looking for a great local bar and grill that serves a good selection of wet, cold beer with really good food and service, this is the place."}
{"text":"2 thumbs up ! Hot wings awesome! Cheap beer and wings were priced right. Wish I lived closer this would be a local hang out. Weekly specials great."}
{"text":"Check this place out based on yelp reviews as we were in town for the high school football game. Definitely the place to be on Friday nights before football! Fun appetizers great burgers! The wings were ok, wife got garlic Parmesan and they were sitting in a liquid garlic sauce...but would try again if/when in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good food! Was visiting my parents about five minutes away and they wanted to order carry out. Placed the order with no problem, and they got everything we asked for perfectly. They were a little taken aback when I showed up to pick up the food with my service dog (I think it was the manager who told me she loves dogs but couldn't have one in the facility, but as soon as I explained she is my medical alert dog and I literally can't go out without her, she understood). Still, I feel their reaction and overall service was better than most places I visit with my service dog. The food was delicious (for god's sake they have a burger stacked between two grilled cheese sandwiches!). The atmosphere was wonderful too. I hope I can done in their restaurant sometime soon! Thanks Mantua Corners for the great dinner and nice service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple cocktails.  Periodically do on a Mon or Tues.  Usually slow for lunch, but Today was much busier!  Busy lunch crowd.  This is more of an employee review since I did not eat any food.  Mike bartender/server ran his behind off with at least 20 ppl sitting at tables and 8 at the bar at peak point lunch time on a Monday.  Could have definitely used alittle help from management running food and expoing the food from kitchen.  Lot of real estate to cover.  Glasses with drinks at tables continuously filled and refilled, patrons seemed happy.  He never stopped moving.  Great job!!!!   When I do sit down and eat,requesting him!   FYI.  Great asset to your store!!!"}
