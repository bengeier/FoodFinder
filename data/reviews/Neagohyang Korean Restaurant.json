{"text":"Good comfort food. I've been coming here since high school whenever I crave piping hot Korean soups, they're all good! My momma makes a pretty mean yuk gae jang, and so far this is the only place that's made one that hasn't made me regret not going home to eat.  All their gooks (hot soups) taste great!"}
{"text":"cheap place to get korean food but they use way too much msg. the interior is really old and dirty. but bc they use so much msg i got addicted to their kimchi fried rice. one of the lady's washroom is alway broken(i think they are fixing it on purpose) and their ingredients (like packs of rice) are in the hall connected to the rear exit. i just find this place not clean. i'd go somewhere else"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant in which I discovered Korean cuisine.   All I have ever ordered in this restaurant was chicken katsu, it was the very first thing I ordered here, and everything else looks too damn authentic.  I guess it's something that got stuck, but if I need a chicken katsu, naturally I come here.  There chicken katsu here is pretty good...... The place is in a majot need of a renovation, so that it can compete with the barrage of other restaurants so densely squeezed on this plot of land at Yonge & Finch.    There are three to four private booths which seats up to five for a Korean BBQ session, and about 12 tables on the floor.  Two or three television screens always displaying pop concert videos.  I don't know, there is basically no d√©cor.  This is a place to come for a quick bite.   I used to show up here 11 in the evening after 3 hours upstairs at YK net cafe playing counter strike and hitting on girls, but those days are long gone.   Sigh....  Once I was eating here, and they closed the debit card machine before I finished, and so I had to dig into my wallet to find the exactly change.  Not cool dude.  Yonge & Finch ain't what it used to be...and this place needs to get with the times."}
{"text":"Consistently a favourite hang out of Korean and Chinese students in the neighbourhood, Neagohyang delivers economical and delicious meals night after night.  What it lacks in innovation, this place certainly brings it in terms of value.  All your Korean standards are well represented on the menu.  I have to admit at being disappointed a couple of times but that certainly hasn't proved to be a deterrent.  (Avoid the overly greasy kim chi fried rice and the deep fried seaweed roll... apologies for not remember what they are called...)   Had the fried chicken once and found it to be too much fried batter and not enough chicken with an overdose of sugary goop to cover it.   Favourites: dolsot bi bim bap, seafood udong, kam ja tang (of course), chicken or pork tonkatsu.   Oh, the cold noodles in the summer are to die for.   I always leave this place well satisfied, heavy of stomach but not much lighter of wallet.    Can't complain about that!"}
{"text":"I went yesterday night with a few of my friends.  Initially, when you enter the place - it gives off a definite Korean feel.  It's a slightly small restaurant, but we had a nice little booth.  The appetizers were the typical Korean appetizers, yet, they didn't provide kimchi for us -- we had to ask them for it.  My friend suggested the dolsot bibimbap.  It was actually pretty good - no complaints.  It was quite filling, and it wasn't too costly.  Service was pretty good in the beginning, but then I think they were trying to kick us out in the end.   All-in-all, a fairly good experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean restaurants. I've been eating here for 8 years, they make THE BEST Yuk Gae Jang imho. Their kam poong gi is also very yummy! Prices are reasonable, their weekday lunch specials = dinner menu but $1 cheaper. LOVE THIS PLACE TO DEATH :D  **UPDATE**  This place is closed for good and has been replaced with Yuzu Izakaya. So sad :("}
