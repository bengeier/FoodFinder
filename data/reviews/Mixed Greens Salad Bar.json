{"text":"I have Mixed feelings about Mixed greens. The lady was quite nice to me, but at the same time, the product I bought just didn't do it.  Some of the stuff wasn't fresh and and certainly wasn't what I was hoping for from a salad bar. Looks a little bit amateur and thrown together. Like there wasn't a lot of heart going into it - or knowledge or something. Maybe both. It's in the mall right across from the YMCA so I guess if you don't want to travel anywhere with a higher standard then it will do. Kind of like dating my brother instead of me.  So in conclusion and summary: Not a big fan. Service was pretty nice even when I came back late to pick up my salad. The food on the other hand didn't do anything for me."}
{"text":"Stopped by Mixed Greens for a salad recently and I was pleasantly surprised by their quality and taste. They don't weigh the salads. Instead, they charge you for a specific salad. I ordered the spicy chicken salad and they loaded it up with greens and sauce. I couldn't tell what kind of chicken was in the salad, but I think it was of the \"lunch meat\" variety instead of breast meat. It was good. The spice was provided by buffalo sauce. I had them toss on some soy beans, which I love.  The salad was great. And at $7.75, it wasn't priced bad either. Comparatively, I can get a loaded salad bowl with fresh grilled chicken breast at Heinen's for $6.99. However, this place is right across the street from my office, so I'll gladly pay the 75 cents to avoid the walk down East 9th.  The taste and quality were very good.  I will definitely be back. I think i found my new lunch spot."}
{"text":"Just a great place to grab a quick healthy bite with friendly helpful staff. They have salads and sandwiches made to order with daily bread options that are fresh and tasty.  Try the oil and vinegar with herbs they made there in sandwich or salad. It's great!  Remember the soups, never had a bad one, but beware, some are spicy!!"}
