{"text":"Not a fan. Very very slow service and they completely forgot our soup which we sat and waited for longer than 40minutes. Spring rolls were chewy and they didn't put Cilantro on my banh mi...and it had 1 slice of jalapeno.... every table was dirty thusly we had to move dirty dishes out of the way to sit down. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Ate at Mr. Pho's for the first time yesterday. Their smoothies are fantastic. I ate their tofu sandwich, the bread was so delicious, I enjoyed the whole sandwich. Service was great, they brought my food to me and a cup of water. At some places they either ask or you have to ask; I liked that they took the initiative. Mr. Pho is in a great spot, especially if you go to UNLV. Very affordable and I recommend stopping by one day."}
{"text":"Really good pho! I used to be scared to try it but my boyfriend likes it a lot. So I tried it and I like it a lot. We used to share a bowl and get extra meat, but I've upgraded and get my own bowl now! There's another spot across the street we used to go to, but it's a little cheaper here and so so good! Had the egg rolls with rice paper once we didn't really care for. Also have tried to beef chow mein that's really good!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was okay. Customer service was kind of rude. I asked what was in the house specials and the server said \"well, there's like stuff in it\". Really? You can't just walk 4 steps and ask the chef? Customer service really needs to improve."}
{"text":"Very friendly and very solid Pho. I had the Brisket and Steak and loved the broth, good vietnamese coffee too."}
{"text":"Unfriendly and unhelpful service. Our shrimp was undercooked and noodle dish had no flavor.Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is the best.. Great sandwiches and great prices for them. UNLV's finest restaurant for students to escape to. Mr. Sandwich stole my heart"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch between classes. At around 12:00 pm when I arrived it wasn't so busy, but luckily I got here just in time before the place got packed. 

I had their combination pho. The broth was okay nothing too great. Everything about the soup was fine except for the onions. They were large chunks of strong onions that entirely ruined the soup. The bowl size wasn't that big either, and overall I paid around $7-8. One thing that I did like was their honey dew slush with boba. I am also aware that this place has various deals however I can't recall all of them (deals such as buy a certain amount of sandwiches and receive one free) It can also apply to drinks and combo meals as well.

Will I come back? Maybe, not for the pho but to try a sandwich or grab a boba."}
{"text":"This place is one of Vegas' best-kept secrets. Been there a couple of times now; LOVE the Tom Yum soup and the curry; spring roles and pot stickers were quite good as well. And everyone is so nice every time I've been there. Great service, great prices (I'm from San Francisco, so for the quality, these prices are amazing)."}
{"text":"Their bahn mi are excellent, but the best thing on their menu is their Panang curry with shrimp and chicken, it's like $9, is enough for one huge meal for one person all by itself, and is sublimely delicious. Creamy and sweet, I always get it a bit spicier than usual (which is exactly what I ask for \"a bit spicier than usual\") and it is one of the best curries in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I am a UNLV student. I walk across the street pretty much 4 times a week just for their sandwich. It is amazingly good! Strongly recommend people to try this place out. Price is reasonable too!"}
{"text":"i enjoyed the other mr. sandwich shop back in chinatown but when i heard one opened up closer to me, i was eager to try it. i haven't tried their pho yet but their tapas are amazing, the banh mi is splendid too! my personal favorite that makes me give them four stars is their jasmine tea boba since they're courteous enough to ask about how much sugar i'd want added. i believe its the little things that make the hospitality industry a bit more enjoyable.

their anime posters are pretty enjoyable too. it helps lighten the mood up there for me even though the mood is always upbeat but still calming."}
{"text":"They definitely aren't settled in yet. When I went in, there were only 5 kinds of sandwiches to choose from. I had a beef brisket banh mi & three colored ice (pictures included).

I opened up my sandwich. Didn't see a lot of meat filling, mostly the greens & onions. I don't think it is worth the $3.99. At least the small amount of meat in the sandwich was tender. The sauce used to season the meat had a nice sweetness to it. As for the baguette, well, bread is just bread.

Not too happy about the three colored ice dessert. Too much ice! I may be exaggerating, but remove the ice and the drink would only reach about halfway up the cup. Also not worth $3.

At the moment, this location is rather mediocre."}
{"text":"I've ordered here before, but never online. Order wasn't ready when I went to pick it up because they \"don't have a machine\" for that order service. Food was ok, not as good as usual and I got an extra box of hearts or livers (gross-I'm vegetarian) and called to ask about it and they wanted me to BRING IT BACK? Um, no. Had been on a plane literally all day and just wanted to eat and sleep!

The thing I usually love about this place is all the Vegan and Veggie options, so I will still go there, but not order online. This was the first sub-par meal."}
{"text":"NO RECOMMENDATION TO THIS PLACE AT ALL!!!! SO DIRTY AND SERVICE SUCKS!!!!!! I ordered one noodle. it took 15mins to come out. service sucks bad!! they only got 1 server/casher. when he brought my dish out, no apology or appreciation. I don't come back here any more and do not recommend to any of my friends live near here and co-workers. sorry you guys lost lots of constitution worker and utilities workers. Too Bad!!"}
{"text":"Good (not great) banh mi and milk tea.  Decent price for college students.

The setup was confusing (I was thrown off by the tables when I first walked in, yet it is an \"order at the counter\" place). 

The staff was nice, but not friendly (no greetings, recommendations or \"Have you been here or at our other store? No? Lemme walk you through\")."}
{"text":"If we talking about affordable, bargain pho, this is the spot for you. As a college student, it is very accessible - right across the street from UNLV's Student Union. Very big menu in terms of flavor for boba. The Banh Mi is solid. Shouts to bossman, he's hella tight. Come on down to Mr. Sandwich! 

- \"Mr #65"}
{"text":"Came here on President's day 2-17-2014.  Just a few customers.  I'd have to say that the price of the Pho was pretty good and catered to \"starving college students\".  The girl who worked there was SOOOOOOO NICE! ....SUPER CUTE as well ;).  She asked us how everything was and was extremely attentive.  The pho was good, not the best but for sure surpassed many pho places in Vegas that charge about $9.00 per bowl.  Pho came out super hot and steamy and was only $5.99.  They were short on bean sprouts that day but it's all good because the worker explained that ahead of time prior to me ordering.  Bottom line:

1.  SERVICE:  5 stars
2.  PHO:  3.5 stars
3.  PRICE:  5 stars
4.  LOCATION:  5 stars"}
{"text":"This place has routinely failed health inspections. 

\"Mr. Sandwich on Maryland Parkway and Harmon failed re-inspection from a previous downgrade.  
Inspectors found bitter melon so moldy, some of it was liquefying, and excessive grease and food debris build-up on things that were stored as clean.\" -News 13

Check out the photo I posted from the inspection report."}
{"text":"The pho and tofu spring rolls are pretty good and decently priced. Not a fan of the sandwiches didn't seem too \"fresh\" if you know what I mean. Also the lady taking the orders is pretty rude. When no one was in there, rushing to take my order which ended up in 3 different transactions, asking for extra anything is like pulling teeth but all in all Good Pho and Vegetarian options. Personally I don't trust the meat.."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment recently with my sister. We've grown up in Thailand so we have high expectations for boba and Asian food; however, the Thai tea boba exceeded our expectations and was reasonably priced at $3 for a medium. The only problem was the speed of service (we waited over five minutes for drinks). Our spring rolls were slightly bland but paired well with the savory peanut sauce. I will definitely return for the Thai tea soon! Make sure to pick up a punch card so your eighth drink is free!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Super reasonable prices, close to campus, and they have so many different types of flavored boba! Passionfruit, passion coconut, kiwi, blueberry, etc. I would come here everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"I rarely come here, but its not my first or my last time. All the food here is a very reasonable price for a good portion. The pho got me full, but I will say that the banh mi is not exactly a filling meal, delicious though. Definitely coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Lol. 
My sister and I come here all the time during our break at school. 

I didn't order food this time but my sister gets the same dish aka the chicken red curry. Today, the chicken tasted rubbery and tasted off kinda like plastic, probably because the way it was cooked that day. Who knows....

When she told the worker that it wasn't good/edible he said \"don't worry the chicken is well cooked honey\" first of all, don't call her honey like she's a child. Second, don't try to make excuses when she gets the same meal every time. The guy wouldn't even try it himself....how about you just accept that fact that it's bad?

He then asked if she wanted shrimp instead. She said yes and the dish came shortly after. The women manager or lady in the front came by our table shortly later and stood by our table staring questionably at us. She then proceeded to say \"was that a way of getting more food\" since I was drinking some of the leftover curry broth, and then just walked away. How did we get more food when they took away the initial dish??? I love the attitude and the stinginess of this restaurant!!!

I'm sorry that your chicken tasted weird.. maybe you shouldn't be rude about it and give us attitude. Maybe you should be more understanding. Maybe if you aren't willing to try your own meat to see if it tastes bad then there is a problem... also work on your customer service skills and get the flies out of your restaurant. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I like curry chicken soup dip bread even too salty for me but inside have HAIR I can't accept it I will never go again....."}
{"text":"Pretty decent viet restaurant. Conveniently located across UNLV, I find myself here pretty often. The convenience is probably my favorite part considering I won't have to drive all the way to Chinatown just to get some boba. 

I've had a bunch of different flavors of their boba slushes, milk teas, and smoothies and they're not all bad considering the location. I like my boba a little chewier than most so I think it's perfect consistency. If chewy boba isn't your thing, this is your warning. I had a peach slush one time that resembled the flavor of peach Ciroc but other than that, I really enjoy their boba. $3-4 for a cup is right up my alley. I'm really fond of their avocado, thai tea, coconut, taro, and honeydew flavors. 

Food wise I stick to pho and sandwiches. Favorite sandwich is always the brisket one. I don't know what they did with the sauce for their brisket but they did it right and it pairs perfectly with the right amount of pickled vegetables too. I'm not picky about pho so everyone one I've had was good too."}
{"text":"Service was great. Came at peak lunch time and still had fast service. Pho was very good! I had the vegetarian pho, it had lots of veggies in it, well done! My husband has the chicken pho, lots of chicken in it, he liked it a lot. Looking forward to trying more things on the menu!     Came back and tried grilled chicken, crisply noodle and pad Thai.  Everything was great!!!"}
{"text":"The food isint the best but it does the job when you just want a filling meal. Big portions."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not clean and is located in a very bad side of town. I love food so even if the location isn't the best I will give the restaurant a try.  They didn't have the Vietnamese 3 color dessert I was hoping they carried so I decided to try their pork spring roll patty. Very big mistake. Not only did it not looked appetizing, it looked very bland in color and lacked  the color and vegetables I'm accustomed to in a pork patty spring roll. I took two bites and I was done. The pork patty was old, very tough and overly cooked. I grabbed my Gatorade and took off. This restaurant deserves just a 1 star only because the cashier/waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"I vaguely remember coming here a couple years ago and finding it messy with a cheap menu of unmemorable food, unsurprised given the UNLV-adjacent location. Returned on a whim recently and things have improved: kitschy but clean inside, decent eats, still cheap. Service is a little odd though- I thought it was just me, but a few other reviews mention the lack of eye contact, too. Overall, it's A-OK.

The bahn mi are decent, better than the nearby Subway when you're wanting a cheap sandwich. The spring rolls are another option, with 3 choices (shrimp/pork roll, shrimp roll, or just pork roll). Price is appropriate for quality given the iceberg lettuce inside. Haven't had their boba, but it's dirt cheap at $4 for a giant cup. 

TIP: They now have a vegan menu. Tofu tom yum will be my next choice."}
{"text":"Good, but the new Viet guy plays old folks' music all the time now. The atmosphere is DEPRESSING"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant near UNLV. One of the only places you can get a light meal under $10. I've had almost every pho soup they serve and havent had a bad experience yet. I highly recommend the brisket. But my favorite thing they serve is their vietnamese meatball sandwich. They raised their prices recently by about a dollar but its still well worth it."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for lunch during the work week. The food is outstanding and cheap. The range of beverages is vast and boba-luscious! The staff are friendly, skillful and quick. There are fancier places to go, but if you just want a good lunch at an affordable price served up by nice people who know what they're doing, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I have tried so many different restaurants in vegas but Mr. Sandwich and Pho is my top favorite.  The foods are so delicious plus the service is amazing.  They always keep their place so clean and make sure your orders were right every time.  So, i would highly recommend all local residents and visitors come Mr. Sandwich and Pho."}
{"text":"My favorite Pho love they know exactly how unlike it now don't even have to order very often manager knows what I want and is perfect service every time.  Also get it delivered at home"}
{"text":"This place is nothing special. What really needs to stand out at pho places is the broth. If their broth isn't amazing, most pho places are just ehh. As for Mr. Sandwich, their broth was decent. Nothing special, but not awesome. It was pretty cheap though and for a decent size."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Much better than the ones inside UNLV and this is just across the street from Student Union. If you like Asian food, mainly Vietnamese food. Then give this place a try. You order up front and then they'll bring the food to you. One thing though, if you're going to buy their package food here, make sure to double check the expiration date. I almost got something expired few months ago until I looked at the expiration date. That's why there's one star off."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Prices. Boss man, the guy who served, awesome person. I have eaten here about a dozen time already since it's next to my work. Love this place."}
{"text":"Great food, huge menu, and incredibly cheap prices. Perfect college restaurant. Charbroiled pulled pork sandwich is the ish!"}
{"text":"The pricing is very reasonable I would say. The sandwiches are great but the boba is just awful. The tapioca pearls were mushy and the boba drink itself tasted powdery. The owner and staff are friendly but there have been multiple times where they have forgotten part of my meal and I have to go tell them I don't have everything I pay for. Also, the air condition feels almost nonexistent and the thousands of fans they have in the store don't seem to make the place any cooler."}
{"text":"The store is a little run down but the food is legit and the employees are great! My hubby had the yellow curry and it was one of the best he's ever had. I had the pad Thai and it was very fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different for a quick lunch between classes. Mr sandwich seem to fit the bill. I'm a big fan of chow fun dishes. I ordered a chicken chow fun despite the fact that it wasn't on the menu.
Ambience: this is a storefront small fast food eatery that is very informal and fairly small. I ordered takeout, so it's hard to comment about the cleanliness. However the men's room was surprisingly clean. And the few tables that were empty, were clean.
Service: there was no one in front of me when I placed my order yet it took about 15 minutes to make the dish. Considering that this was not on the menu, I guess that was a fair amount of time. Also, most of the tables were filled so they were cooking for alunch crowd.  However, it really shouldn't take that long to put together a dish like this considering the noodles were probably already prepared and the chicken should have been readily available.
Food: the portion size was fairly large. The noodles had an excellent consistency and were quite tasty. There was an adequate amount of chicken in the dish. Overall I would consider it good but not great. At $9 for the dish, it was a fair. value for the price. Overall, good for a change of pace lunch."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic lunch stop near UNLV. So far I've had their banh mi, which tastes great, and is very filling for the price. (At the time of this review, a house special banh mi is $3.50!!) I'd order two if I thought I could finish it. 

I see practically zero downsides to this place. Great location (right off the crosswalk), outdoor seating, and simple / tasty food for under $5. (If you want a big bowl of pho, you're going to pay around $7-8, but that's still great for lunch.)

Seriously, check this place out. This is a local business that I'd love to see succeed."}
{"text":"The prices are awesome and consumer friendly for those on a tight budget. I really enjoyed the pho I had! For $5.99 as a set size large pho bowl... Does the pho fix!!

 And you cannot beat their boba drink prices for medium is $3 and large is $4 and they do not charge for mixing flavors. And they have some pretty unique flavors like avocado, durian, and jackfruit to name a few. 

The service was very personable. And the owner is very friendly and converses with his customers. But seriously cannot beat the price. 

The scrambled egg with Chinese sausage bahn mi was also very very good. Add a little saraicha sauce and bomb.com and their bahn mi prices are $3.50 again can't beat that price. 

I give it 4 stars because the hours of operation are standard. Not the Vegas late hours so I can't go later than 9 for a pho or boba fix. And weekends they close even earlier. 

The place has good food and definitely affordable and pocket friendly. I will be returning"}
{"text":"This Mr. sandwich interior is designed very cute and anime like and it was playing very chill music , atmosphere was very casual and nice , food was okay not the most amazing thing in the world , I ordered the pork patty roll and the pork was kinda burnt and I got the seafood Tom yum , it had shrimp, squid, fish balls, chunks of fish in it, and a chunk of ginger in it . I thought this soup wasn't too spicy and the noodles were made to perfection so this soup was pretty good to me . I also got an avocado smoothie boba , they allow you to substitute milk for almond milk or soy milk which I thought was pretty amazing so I got the almond milk with it. The smoothie was bomb.com but the boba was a little weird it felt like I was chewing plastic haha thank god I got light boba. Overall this place deserves a 3 star, maybe a 4 star but I'll have to come back and try their other stuff before I can upgrade to a 4 star"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch a few months ago. Long story short, the pho was bland and I found a rubber band in it. I wanted to throw up. When my boyfriend went to tell the person at the register what had happened he shortly replied \"sorry\" and refunded just the price of my pho. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I come here often because I basically live across the street.  I LOVE that they have VEGAN options!!!  They have a separate menu for vegans.  Their vegan curry dish is my favorite(pretty spicy)!  I also like the spring rolls with the yummy peanut dipping sauce.  I also get a mango smoothie with coconut milk from time to time and it's delish!  Staff has always been friendly and food is ready fast.  This is a great spot :) pretty healthy too/lots of veggies on the menu!"}
{"text":"The slushes, smoothies & milk teas are always good. The Pho hai san is really good. I love that its right by UNLV so that I can get my boba fix. Its really good. :3"}
{"text":"I told myself I shouldn't distrust the place just because it's called the utilitarian-sounding \"Mr. Sandwich.\" After all, Homer Simpson's Mr. Plow business was a success, and \"Mr. Blue Sky\" is one of ELO's best songs, right? 

Unfortunately, I should have followed my elitist instincts and skipped this place. I should note that I've heard good things about the sandwiches and fried rice here, but I don't judge Vietnamese restaurants based on those dishes. I judge on the quality of the pho, and it's lacking here.

When grocery shopping, I used to stock up on packets consisting of a small amount of rice noodles, a bit of oil and flavored powder. Although the noodles were billed as \"Asian,\" they paled in comparison with anything served in a restaurant and served as little more than a small, mildly satisfying snack.

The seafood pho I got at Mr. Sandwich bore a remarkable resemblance to these packaged soups, right down to the noodle texture and bitter undertaste. The seafood didn't impress, nor did the sliced tomatoes (?) included in the broth. 

The restaurant's atmosphere was similarly underwhelming. On a hot summer day, one of the doors was wide-open, leaving the seating area uncomfortably warm. No bean sprouts or sliced jalapenos were served with my soup; I had to ask for them. The non-bottled water tasted bad -- a not-uncommon problem at desert eateries. And the food didn't arrive quickly. 

This place might be a great experience if you're looking for banh mi and bottled water on a late-fall day. But I advise against replicating my poor experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love the Pho Chin nam as a eat-in and for pick up. The workers are very nice!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and the food is alright, other pho restaurants in vegas far outshine the quality. The service has always been unfriendly and the men can even be hostile towards customers. The cashier refused to make eye contact with me and was hostile and chastising because I asked him about the water I ordered. 

Definitely not worth a visit."}
{"text":"friendly service, decent food a little bit of fat left on the brisket i ate but other than that it was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting.  Three of us ate there and three of us were completely disgusted by our orders. 1 vegan; 2 meat eaters; 3 completely different orders and they were all horrible.  I cannot say enough bad things about this place."}
{"text":"I don't know if my reviews are accurate because I always get the same thing. Bahn mi... Or, the sandwich. Based on only this, it's good. They make them nice and toasted with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place, they have a separate vegan menu... what could go wrong?! Until I saw the C rating posted from the health department, and I got curious...

Let me start out by saying the positive parts of my experience. First off I love the decor of this small Vietnamese spot. Multicolored lights, anime decor and a huge menu to choose from. Along with a 18 choice Vegan menu. My food was quickly proccessed, delicious and tasted fresh. All really good things!! Until the C rating caught my eye and I stopped eating to look up what demerits this place was dinged on.

WOW. I will link the SNHD review with Mr. Sandwich below but here are the bigger cliff points of interest:

1. They have had a rocky inconsistent review rating since 2014. 
2. They have been closed down by the SNHD TWICE.
3. They have had MAJOR roach infestation issues on clean dishes, soy sauce dishes, storage containers. 
4. Not washing hands.
5. Not handling raw food correctly or storing them correctly. 

This place has not learned its lesson of standards and good practices, evident by the repeat offenses. I will NEVER return.

{"text":"Seafood Noodle Soup $7.99

Curry Lamb with French bread $9.99

Durian smoothie $4

My wife and I came here for a quick lunch. We always pass by this place as its on the way to Seafood City where we grocery shop. My wife said her soup was bland and not worth the price. My curry lamb was good but you pretty much get meat, broth, and bread for 10 bucks. I was expecting at least some vegetables. I admit though that the curry broth was pretty good and so was the bread. The bread was very airy and light and perfect for using a sponge to soak up the broth. I would have rated this place 2 stars if not for the fact that they serve a lot of drinks (i.e. smoothies, lattes, slush, etc.). This is probably the first place I've been to in the U.S. that sold a durian drink so I had to try. They say that durian smells like old mushy onions in custard form. And boy, were they right! The drink was quite strong to say the least but I'm glad I tried it. I wanna come back and try their sandwiches with their bread...."}
{"text":"My family and I are vegan and were excited to come here for all the vegan options. The first time i went there, it was absolutely amazing. The second time was seriously so awful. they gave us our boba drink with real milk and also gave us potstickers with meat in it. It was terrible. I know they have good vegan food but mistakes like that are pretty unforgivable. They did give us money back, but sadly we just cant trust to go back."}
{"text":"The place is right across UNLV and caters more to students. The place is nice, staff helpful. Menu is varied. The Vietnamese soups are typically whe same as other places. I had their Bong Bo Huey and it was good. Soup was spicy enough but I added more to suit my taste. The pork hock needed more time in the boiler to soften it up. The noodles too were not to my liking since it was spaghetti noodles instead of rice noodles. I would prefer rice vermicelli. Prices are very reasonable and the bowls are large enough to share. I would come back though and try other things..."}
{"text":"This place has the nastiest pork sandwich.  It didn't taste right  at all. It was dry. I'll be going back to hue thai"}
{"text":"Great Boba!!!

So I just came here for the first time today and this review is based solely off of their Boba smoothie drinks!! Okay, so I was feeling rather parched and wanted a sweet treat so I thought to myself why not a smoothie lol.  Anyways I ordered a mango coconut smoothie with Boba in extra large, cause why not?  For the price the amount you get is pretty substantial. It was $5.00 and 0.40 cents extra for boba, and no charge for mixed flavors. I've paid more for less at other places, so I didn't trip. The taste is really good too, not watery or anything. The customer service is really good, lots of smiles and I was greeted as soon as I walked in. I got a really chill vibe from the inside and it seems like you can come here alone or with a friend to eat and just relax. I plan on coming back to try actual food on my next visit!"}
{"text":"The pho was so-so. There was barely any meat on my bowl. But the Thai Tea was so so so so good. :')"}
{"text":"Awesome Banh Mi sandwiches. They are perfectly made and compare to the best of the best I have had across the country. I have 5 days left in Vegas and will be back here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the food there! But the lady that works there gives the worst customer service ever! When in the restaurant she seem like she was rushing us on ordering and when I just called I she was rushing again! After I told her what I wanted she literally said \"Okay 2 number 31s okay hurry up!\" Before i could even modify my order she said in a such a rude tone \"Okay are you going to order anything else?\" Honestly if the food wasn't so good and I could find a good banh mi place better than them I wouldn't even return!"}
{"text":"you get what you pay for good price on pho but the broth is like soup mix water and they give you very little brisket , plus make up the short basil with greens that suck you can always tell if its bone made broth instead of mix. I haven't even looked at the sandwich or rolls yet . all well that's delivery . im going to stick with saigon 8 on eastern and the guy couldn't understand my English on the phone made me text the order then texted it back wrong. I even asked for extra basile got like 2 sprigs total. they exist off poor college students they don't care about quality.. edit time . jumped back on after opening my rolls and sandwich . didn't think it could get worse. pork grilled sand was terrible . the bread is old , i  mean old . NO veggies if it wasn't delivery I would walk up to the counter a say waz up.  the spring roll had a old smelly piece of shrimp and nothing but iceberg lettuce in it  UNBELIEVABLE ! the egg rolls were like mini chinese burritos deep fried pressed crap . BOY THEY SCREWED ME ! I give this place a year tops even with those poor students across the street. my dog wouldn't eat it and she will eat anything."}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot located across from UNLV.  Offering unique and traditional sandwiches both Vietnamese and American style combinations of meats as well as Pho.  Prices were very reasonable if your on a budget and the portions were satisfying.  Staff is friendly and there is plenty of vegas publications available to browse while waiting for your meal to be prepared.  

I will be back."}
{"text":"FOOD:  I'm a Vietnamese person who knows Vietnamese food.  I wanted to give this place a try and ordered the chicken pho and a mango smoothie.  The pho's flavor was below average, contained too much fat/oil, and was not served with any fresh chili slices or the proper portion of bean sprouts.  The smoothie had very little mango and too much filler and lacked any real fruit taste, so I left over half of it at the table.

SERVICE:  is counter to table where you walk up to order and your foot is brought to you.  However, no one checks in on how you are doing and the staff is not very responsive even when you ask for things.

AMBIANCE:  is sub par.  While it is not all-out dirty, I would not call this place clean either.  Seating is somewhat limited and the parking lot can get full during rush periods when UNLV is in session.

VALUE:  the pho and smoothie cost be over $11 and was not worth the price at all."}
{"text":"So this used to be a regular spot and I recommended it highly to people but after yesterdays incident with my drink, I think I won't be eating here anymore. I ordered two drinks, lavender milk tea and taro slushie. One was for me and the other was for my sister. I drank mines on the way home and I started feeling nauseous??? I was completely fine all day and suddenly I started feeling really sick. When I got home, I threw up my drink... Kinda makes me wonder if the stuff they put in it went spoiled or something else... never coming here again"}
{"text":"I ordered calamari and stew. The calamari was super soggy, just mushy coating.... I had to throw it away. The stew was okay but also not great. I ordered two banh mi as well and it came super soggy haven't eaten it yet not holding my breath for anything amazing."}
{"text":"Very good Pho. I got the 65 and it was very tasty. Their spring rolls are delicious as well. It's only 2 minutes from my office so I'll definitely come back and try other things."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to grab some boba. The prices were really cheap and ordered , then about 10 minutes later we still do not have our boba. People who came in after us were getting theirs , so then we go up to the registrar to ask for our money back . The cashier then hands me one but it wasn't the one I ordered , I was disappointed . We got a refund and I don't think I'll ever go back ."}
{"text":"Had the squid appetizer. Nothing else but the squid. But I will come back just for that. Maybe at some point I will order some of their other fare, but for now this is squid heaven for me.
The service was friendly and the wait was short considering the amount of customers there."}
{"text":"First time trying Mr Sandwich - so good! Food was ready fast, service was great, and the food was hot and delicious! I ordered the beef brisket ban mi which was a little spicy (I am not a huge fan of spice), but it was delicious. Potstickers were also very good. They have a big drink selection too if you like Thai tea or Vietnamese coffee.  highly recommend and will go back."}
{"text":"We ordered two of their #61, which is the combination beef pho.

The portion was appropriate but they only gave one serving of bean sprouts and mint plate.  Since we ordered two dishes I thought they would bring two plates out..I had to ask for another plate of bean sprouts and the mint.

I also ordered one passion fruit boba slushie for my kids and they commented that the boba was hard.  Now, everyone knows boba should be soft and chewy, not hard.  This usually happens I think when the bona's been sitting around too long.  I know when I have placed left over boba drink in my fridge, the boba would harden up.

I would return if I couldn't find another pho nearby."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here right after school, however my interest in this place is fading away. The new workers are very slow with your orders and unorganized. I dined in and it took 25 minutes to get my order of pad thai and iced coffee. My pad Thai was slightly burnt. How do you burn noodles and shrimp? I would rather eat elsewhere. Then my iced coffee had no boba which are my favorite ingredient in iced coffee. I don't like writing bad reviews, but this is the worst service I have ever received in a long time."}
{"text":"Place is amazing!  Definitely recommend their boba and chicken noodle soup.  Always friendly and fast!  Would highly recommend coming here for lunch!"}
{"text":"Before I had a yelp and checking in was a thing for me, I've been here countless times because of the convenience as a college student. Service was decent.  

I would not recommend any of their Pho based noodle soups. They are for people who have no taste buds. Their pho has let me down many times. There is no flavor in their broth. It's basically like hot water. It wasn't even worthy of a photo like all the other ramen pictures I've posted. 

So far the only dish I find tolerable is their Pad See Ew which is almost like a pad thai. But other than that I would NOT come here for pho. Total disappointment. They need to improve their broth!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best banh mi in town. I'm still bummed that his expansions on the west side of town didn't pan out. Now I have to go to the east side to get it, but my kids ask for this all the time. Great deal, great banh mi, and great local business."}
{"text":"The price is right! Get a sandwich and a boba tea for 7 bucks. Crazy  they have tofu. Oh yeah"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food but they always seem to forget something. On almost every order I've made they've either put meat on a vegetarian dish or forgot all sauces that are important on making the dishes complete. The workers seem over worked, such as the cooks are working as cooks, servers, and cashiers. They seem to be doing pretty well so I don't understand why they don't hire workers for specific positions so things work better. I just get so frustrated with how unorganized everything is and I feel the stress of the workers."}
{"text":"Please don't come here and think all Vietnamese foods are like this. Noodles are salty yet bland, low quality, coffee is NOT authentic. Service? I ordered one thing and TOT
ALLY received another thing with the excuses: 
-Oh, we don't have ground pork so we substitute with meat loaf for you (I don't want any meat loaf) 
-Oh, we don't serve pork organ anymore so it's not in the soup (why didn't you tell me that when I order? Or you should change your menu)
Well, we're not local but will never come back anyway."}
{"text":"Mr. Sandwich is a great quick pho place. The pho and sandwiches here are amazing and everything is cheap. They have a loyalty card for drinks and entrees; you can earn a free meal at 7 which is fairly low. The interior is a little small and could be cleaner, but never anything to worry about. The service is amazing here, and they are very quick."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food. Price was very fair and he good came out quick . Will definitely eat here again when I'm In town. . Not a fancy schmancy place but was playing decent music and a good level so it wasn't annoying ."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Vietnamese food, I don't recommend this place. I ordered the vermicelli noodle bowl and was actually taken back by how dry, bland, and oddly cooked it was. The restaurant could be cleaner too.. 
This place is called Mr. Sandwich so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt that their sandwiches are much better than their other menu items."}
{"text":"Their spring roll is pretty good. It has chicken and shrimp. You get two for $3.95. For me, it's more than enough for like three people. They cut in half for you. Right amount of meat and vegetables.

They have udon for $7.99. It's good enough for three people. They smother it in sauce. I got it with chicken. The chicken was cooked well. It was really good. Had a lot of flavor. The sauce is sort of sweet. 

Their potstickers is $4.99 for 6. It's fried. It's good. It's like any other potstickers. Nothing special.

The combination beef pho is $7.99. The broth is really good. The noodles is good. They have herbs that are overwhelming when you take a bite of it but otherwise it's really good. 

The service is pretty good. They're nice. It seems like it's all about business. Do your transaction and go on with your ways."}
{"text":"I ordered at 3. They said they'll call 20 mins later. They didn't. I called at 4:30. And they said they are sending the guy now. They're 10 mins away!!! I can't walk or drive at the moment. So, I hungrily waited.

I paid by card but they never gave me the receipt to sign.

WTH is wrong with them?! Food was good but piss poor service.

I ordered the Penang chicken and shrimp, but it was mostly sauce with nearly NO MEAT at all!!!

This is the thanks I get for ordering from them DAILY!  

They're lucky the food is good!

Why did they punish me for their mistakes by skipping me out on meat! They're freakin 10 mins away!"}
{"text":"This place WAS the spot to eat at between classes at UNLV. In fact I ate here maybe once every 1-2 weeks. However today this has changed. Why? Roaches. In my food. ROACHES.

I understand this isn't the cleanest place around nor are the staff too friendly but this food WAS bomb delicious. Today in between class I decided to eat here as it is my birthday and I wanted a cheap tasty lunch that wouldn't fill me up too much for dinner. Started eating my pad see ew with pork that I have gotten every time. As I am chowing down making comments such as \"WOW this plate is bottomless\" and \"I can't believe it but I am going to try to eat this whole thing!\" I suddenly jump back because I thought I saw a bug in the noodles. It was hard to tell at first because it was covered in sauce YUM but after my boyfriend flipped it over it most definitely had legs. As I held back tears because seriously WTF, I took my plate up to the cashier who said \"Ew sorry let me give you your money back\". Thanks. Perfect way to handle this situation. Who knows how many roaches are being cooked into the food. Boyfriend ended up getting his money back too because no way in hell is he going to take another bite knowing the food is prepared in those nasty conditions. 

Word of advice to students or any other customers eating there. DON'T! 
If there was a ROACH in my food then there is a good chance there could be one in yours too."}
{"text":"I happened to walk by here and saw a sign in the window that had a vegetarian/vegan menu. I hadn't had a Vietnamese sandwich in a long time, and was excited about the fact they had a tofu sandwich. I got a sandwich, fries, and a mango boba. It was a tad slow, but mainly because they got super busy after I ordered. Food was great, everything came to about $10, and I got a ton of fries. Only downsides were: My food didn't all come out at the same time, the fries took a while, so my sandwich was already done by the time the fries came (I really tried to wait). Only other downside is if they're going to have a vegan menu, it would be cool to have soy milk or almond milk for the boba teas (I had it anyways, and it was good, but I prefer not to consume dairy if an alternative is available). I definitely want to come back for some vegan pho, as a lot of places that serve pho typically use meat based broth."}
{"text":"Everyone was right when they say its cheap here cause it really is. My bowl of pho was $6 and it is a large bowl! My milktea was $4.45 because its was large and i asked for a boba with it. Compared to other pho places,this one hits the spot when it comes to cheap eats.

Downfall is that their broth for the pho isnt so much to my liking, I feel like there is something missing. I keep comparing it to the taste of pho kim long,pho so 1 and pho Saigon 8. These are 3 different pho restaurants that I usually go depending on where im the closets. Although it is personal preference, if youre one of the people who goes to restaurants I mentioned, just dont expect so much from here.

Their service is very personable and I like it. The guy who took my order was very cheerful and it definitely sets a good mood since Im really hungry!

Try it out and see for yourself and Ill definitely give it another shot here. After all, they have stamp cards;)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They have a big menu and VEGAN options. I know how hard it is to find a place that everyone can eat. It sucks  the staff has to deal with rude people."}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the rough. I didn't think I'd ever say that judging from the exterior of the restaurant. The place looks extremely cheesy from the outside and you really don't understand what this place serves. It is Vietnamese food with the french cafe vibe to it. You walk in, and its just a small and friendly place. The staff is extremely friendly, the menu also contains a lot of niche items like Vietnamese coffee which I would rate five out of five stars. If you like soups a must get here is the rare beef. It's spicy, flavorful beyond compare, and overall is absolutely one of the best noodle soups ive ever had. The proverb once again proves correct to not judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"I've never had a Vietnamese/French  sandwich but I really enjoyed my first experience. I got the chicken sandwich #38. The roll was perfectly fluffy with a great crispy crust. My favorite part was discovering the type of vegetables used. Cucumbers, carrots, jalapeño and cilantro. I was honestly elated to find a sandwich in town that doesn't focus on lettuce and tomato as a constant. The place is super casual, nothing special comes to mind about atmosphere, but come here for the food."}
{"text":"We got some delivered, glad we did.
Fantastic shrimp rolls that blew us away.  I could have eaten a bowl of them.
The Korean Back Ribs were nice, perhaps a lil overcooked, flavorful but needed maybe some extra sauce for the rice.
My hubby had the Pork, Egg Roll and Vermicelli, was good but not as good as San Diegos that we were blessed with so often.
Overall good portions and tasty and fresh.
Would have given 4 stars but didn't because there is a minimum of $25 for delivery but then they tack on a delivery fee and then plus tip, makes it not so cheap dinner for 2."}
{"text":"Oh heck yes! It is on like Donkey Kong! I LOVE the pho here! Right across the street from UNLV, it's off to pho I go! I have had a bite here and there of friends food, but I stick to the pho! Humm, now I really want pho.."}
{"text":"This new Mr. Sandwich location has replaced boardhouse subs that recently closed down. 

VERY tasty Vietnamese Banh Mi sandwiches with a lot of good filling and meat. Reasonable prices $3.50 a sandwich. Their bread is perfect and exactly how I like my baguettes to be, fresh, crunchy and chewy. 

They just opened 2 days ago so the restaurant is not yet stocked with all the goodies that their China location offers but it'll happen in a few weeks I am sure. 

I will be coming by often before classes for lunch to get my banh mi fix."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was disappointed because I ordered rare steak pho to go & im realized once I got back to UNLV they didn't include the bean sprouts, mint leaves etc. & no utensils & barely any meat and pho noodles. 

But then the next day they redeemed themselves :) They included everything, including sriracha and hoisin sauce which I also had to ask for the day before but that wasn't a big deal. They also included the veggies & utensils & also left room in the broth container for me to be able to add everything without the soup overflowing..like how it did the day before. 

I also ordered the white chocolate mocha coffee hot with boba and wow it was really addicting. Try the hot milk teas too! Perfect for this cold ass weather. 

Overall, it's a convenient walk across the street from school and the workers were very nice and honest. I say honest because apparently they have 2 different menus or something like that and he informed us that we were looking at the wrong menu & that the pricing was different. Idk why they would have the other menu there to confuse people but at least I know for the future I guess. I was much happier with my second visit and will definitely be coming back for that white chocolate mocha coffee!"}
{"text":"This place is delish. Absolutely love this place. A must try while visiting Las Vegas. their sandwiches and pho are to die for"}
{"text":"Decent Bahn Mi but only decent.  Lacking a lot of the flavor a Bahn Mi should have and very skimpy on the meat.  I'm giving it 3 stars based on tea selection, price,  and location.  Haven't tried the Pho here and not sure that I will but I'll definitely grab another Bahn Mi from here when I'm in a pinch and get that craving."}
{"text":"As mentioned before this is a great place for UNLV students who are rushing to get a lunch between classes. The place is a little dirty, but I feel it's what is to be expected from the general location and from the prices. I always get a grilled beef sandwich, which is always adequate. Their bread is fairly fresh, but their beef tends to be a little chewy for my liking. I have had pho there before and my advice is no - there are better pho places in town, don't waste your money here. It's greasy, bland, no flavor whatsoever. My favorite is definitely their spring rolls - they are light and oh-do-good (only have lettuce in them as for the greens so definitely a must for people who don't like strong flavors in their spring rolls)."}
{"text":"Alright, I'm giving this place four stars because the Tofu Curry is AMAZING. So filling for an eight dollar vegan lunch. 

Honestly, I usually hate people that write shitty reviews on Yelp. This is my first (and I don't know if it counts because I'm still giving this place four stars).  I think it's a huge waste of time to talk about a terrible customer service experience because...well who really cares? But, I had a pretty awful experience last week so listen to me complain.

The night of February 14th, Valentine's, I wanted to take my date out to eat at this location for the amazing Tofu Curry I was talking about earlier. The door said open until 9PM. A man stood inside behind the counter on his cell phone, the doors were locked, and he refused to acknowledge people were at the door. Now, if this was an employee I would think that he was really ballsy to do what I've wanted to do at all of my food service jobs... lock the door early. Anyways, I just found out that it wasn't an employee. 

It was the owner. I think it's a little cynical to lock the doors early on Valentine's day, but to just stand behind the counter, in plain view of people knocking at the door of your business and not give an explanation? I wouldn't be writing this if he cracked the door open and explained that he wanted to go home early or that it was slow and everything was cleaned up and turned off.... but he just stood in plain view of the door on his cell phone and he didn't turn around and acknowledge the fact  people were outside, standing infront of a sign saying open until 9PM at about 7PM. 

Was he just having an off day? I couldn't tell you, he didn't open his door and acknowledge me or speak to me. He stood on his cell phone, in plain view of door, ignoring people that wanted to have Valentine's day dinner at his restaurant lol"}
{"text":"maybe i will change my review once i have the food. but so far customer service was pretty rude & i asked for a milk tea with boba & he gave me coffee....gross coffee at that! what a waste."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick Vietnamese sandwich and Pho fix if you are at UNLV. They are not the best but are ok for satisfying hunger after a long day of cramming in the library."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I order their fried rice!! It's soooooo good!! I recommend this place. Their Thai tea isn't that bad either."}
{"text":"Seriously the best banh mi ever! I'm not Vietnamese, so I can't accurately judge the sandwiches, but this place has got the best. The sauce they use makes it real good. This place is the Vietnamese version of Filiberto's. The food is awesome, low-priced, and served relatively quick."}
{"text":"The #93 with a Thai Iced Tea. No trip to Vegas is complete without a stop at Mr. Sandwich. Without a doubt the best bowl in town!"}
{"text":"Evertime I wash clothes here I always come to this place. Their Food is cooked fresh. You will enjoy this atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre. Why is this kitchen so small and the menu so big. There is something wrong. like all Vietnamese places, food portions are small, minimal service. I ordered a chicken broth noodle that needed lime seasoning and hot sauce to have much taste. watch out for the msg. this place is sure to use it. 

overall, if you are desperately hungry and want to skip chipotle. then it is worth one try, but not a second."}
{"text":"$4 dollar sandwiches and pretty tasty could use a little more meat but for the price life is good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here often after class/work at UNLV. They have a very huge selection of boba drinks, including non-milk smoothies, which is great because I'm lactose intolerant. 

Their food is good and consistent. I almost always get the pho tai and it is good and reasonably priced. The service is usually pretty fast. 

I would say there are better pho places out there. However, the pho is good and it's cheap and in a convenient location. They are always friendly so that is a bonus."}
{"text":"Great food. Beat pho in town. Friendly staff even though they have to deal with the entitled college kids all day."}
{"text":"This is a new convenient spot for students at UNLV to get their pho or banh mi fix. Located on Maryland Parkway, it's directly across from the walkway by the Student Union.
 
The place is clean and service is always friendly and accommodating. I love their pho broth here. It almost has a hint of jasmine tea to it. Last time I came in I asked for a side of the broth to go with my chicken banh mi and they gave it to me, no charge. I also told him I was only going to eat the half of my sandwich there so they cut it in half for me. So awesome! Little things that matter.

Their bahn mis aren't the best I've ever had but they're cheap and good. I think I'm warming up to the bread they serve it on, which is soft and doughy instead of the usual crunchy baguettes.

If you're in the hood, I recommend this place for a nice cheap sandwich or some amazing soup. Hits the spot and is easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Good points:
-Fantastic smoothies
-Full vegan menu
-Will accommodate for dietary needs
-Reasonably priced

Not-so-good points:
-Mediocre banh mi - good filling but not much veg, stingy with the jalapeno, and their bread is not fantastic. Not bad, not the best either.
-Mediocre spring rolls - stuffed with iceberg instead of mint and basil, sauce super-sweet and obviously not made in-house.

Basically, it's great for a quick snack if you don't have time to go elsewhere, and fantastic for a drink. If you're in the mood for banh mi or pho, do yourself a favor and walk two blocks up the street to Pho Thanh Huong.

Edit: Bumping this up to 4 stars because their thai tea is pretty great. They no longer do free drink size upgrades on weekends but have implemented a buy-6-get-one-free card program so at least there's something."}
{"text":"Quick service and quality foods. Price is reasonable. I love pho. Soup base is delicious.  Rare beef soft, tender and fresh. Delicious.  Small shop so friendly atmosphere.  Very enjoyable eating here."}
{"text":"Ordered to go banh mi here and it was decent. The bread was a little too soft and soggy for me, it needs a little crunch to it. I got the banh mi dac biet and the pork meat. Thought there was jalapeños in it but it was just green bell peppers so it wasn't spicy. The lady there was very friendly to us. We got our order pretty quick."}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD. BAD SERVICE. READ!!!!!

This is a very convenient place to go if your a Unlv student looking for pho and more. The food is great and comes out in a timely matter. 


But My  reason for giving this place a one star is because there's one specific Asian women who always takes the orders is VERY RUDE!!!!! I haven't seen anybody else but her taking orders soo. But I say that because for one when she takes the orders if you don't know the number but you know what you want she screams \"what number!\" then she rushes you to order if their busy, my order wasn't even done and at one point I had to tell her to not rush me!! Then I asked for extra greens onions twice nobody brought it then once they brought out my egg rolls and i began to eat them the meat had a slight pinkish tint to it, i didn't complain because it was my first time getting egg rolls my second time being here soo i wasn't sure if it was just me or the food, as I was about to leave I needed a to go cup for my drink and they do have a station that has to go cups and to go plates for your food ONLY like I said I needed a Togo cup for my drink and a bigger bag for my leftovers I simply asked the same women for a cup and a bag and she again yelled at me \"it's over there!\" I go look and what I'm looking for is not there soo I asked her again she yells again for a third time \"were very busy! You can get it yourself\" well I obviously couldn't get it myself!!! After waiting around for the next employee or the owner who in a nice way gave me the bag and smiled at me i got my stuff and left.

I completely understand that they were busy and it's a small place but I'm a bartender and your still suppose to provide excellence customer service busy or not I'm a paying customer like everybody else and that was absolutely disgusting for her to treat me like that being that that was my 2nd time coming there and it sucks that the rest of the employees were very nice but because of that one certain employee and her very shitty attitude and lack of customer service is what ruins that place. I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE GOING BACK OR SPENDING MY MONEY IN THAT PLACE! There's other great pho places anyway!!! That treat their customers better. make this about race but if you weren't Asian she was very rude to you!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is great, it's so convenient and so cheap! Broke college student cheap! Lol. I love pho and this place fixes my pho, boba and sandwich crave. They don't have the student special anymore (buy $12 worth of food and get a free Thai tea) but they are working to get stamp cards? Hopefully those come out soon! Love their food here!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequently come here for lunch in between classes. Conveniently located across the street from UNLV's student union. Very decent pricing --affordable on a student budget! Nice service from the owner himself.
I get their yummy banh mi ga when I'm not too hungry. Pho and bun are good- most of the time. Main complaint is the inconsistency. Some days it tastes stellar and others the meat can taste not very fresh. I have found that it is best to go during a day when class is in session and during lunch hours. 
Vegetarians will appreciate the large Vege/vegan menu. 
Large drink menu but I am not a fan of them. Drinks are powder-based. Convenient place to go when we need our pho fix (which is often..)."}
{"text":"I ordered food through Uber eats. When the item arrived it was incorrect. I ordered shrimp rolls and received a few pieces of fried shrimp. I spoke to the restaurant to try and correct it and who ever picked up was so rude and they were of no help. First she told me she didn't have shrimp rolls. Then she told me that I ordered the wrong item when it's clearly listed on their menu as a shrimp roll not fried shrimp. Finally she told me she could do nothing for me. I understand mistakes but none of this is my fault but I'm the one who's screwed? Not a good way to treat customers. I didn't even get an apology just that it was my fault. Many times a simple I'm sorry would suffice but I'm never eating here again."}
{"text":"Went here a few times and I love it plus it's convenient since I'm down the street and the fact that my sister is vegetarian lol. I love the food and boba here, the service is nice and the atmosphere is Hella cute!"}
{"text":"This place is in a very convenient spot. Close to unlv and homes. There is a variety to choose from. I've had the sandwiches and pho and haven't been disappointed once. The prices fit anyone's budget."}
{"text":"Everything on the vegan menu is super yummy, but they are constantly closing early. States they are open until 9pm during the week, yet I've pulled up before 7pm, and they are already closed up. Would love to give a better review because I love the food and staff."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the thai tea was just the way i like it. Definitely coming back when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty busy when I came in here but I didn't mind at all, it was humid and the tables were dirty. It's the food that we're talking about here though. The Bahn Mi that I got was the ga nuong, charbroiled chicken. The drink that I got was the traditional coffee. Now the sandwich was pretty standard, very solid. Nothing special about it, but the meat was good. MmMM NOW FOR THE DRINK WHWHHHWHWHW WHAT IS THAT?? WHHH I M USED TO LEES COFFEE SO I WAS EXPECTING A SIMILAR FLAVOR..bb but...alas I took a sip and IT TASTED LIKE ALCHOHOL WAS THE COFFEE STRONK OR WAS IT JUST ALCHOHOL I DONT OK K JIKNOW ...AUMMMMM..3/5 though..solid, nice. Would come here again for the lavender boba milk tea"}
{"text":"Oh to be in college again......located right across the street from UNLV.....parking lot was a disaster. Seating was cramped. Restaurant felt like I was in SE Asia. Kinda dirty. That being said the Bahn mi and pho were tasty and fairly cheap....perfect for the broke college kid."}
{"text":"Good but missing something. Maybe I hung up on price because it's cheaper many other places. But I'd go again and I'd def Order way more if this est had delivery. 
I originally had this place at a four but it deserves a five. 
Eat here esp if you are a student and trying to stretch them dollars. 
I brought the sandwich back home and all of my guest ate them so I'm happy to find a sandwich place I can recommend. 
They should offer curb side. Or maybe dona food truck!!!"}
{"text":"I've never been to the other location so I don't really know the differences between the two. It's location is a plus because I wouldn't have to go down to Chinatown to get pho! I can just walk across the street & its prices are reasonable & very college friendly. 

It was odd to come in without a server but it's nothing too major. I'd like to, however, be able to have condiments ready at the table rather than having to take it from another table or ask a waiter. I mean it's not asking for a lot considering most restaurants already have them ready to be used. But then again, this could be for the fact that they just recently opened up. Who knows?"}
{"text":"Food was fine. Had chicken chow mien & Thai tea + egg rolls.

The management needs to check the condiments that are on the tables.  The sriracha at my table had an expiration date of April 2013 - nearly 11 months old!"}
{"text":"It's all about the Pho here! The best ones are the Ox  Tail and Shrimp Pho. Always consistent and some of the best Pho in town. The Bahn Mi sandwiches are pretty good too and very cheap!!"}
{"text":"Will never order from this place again the owner was rude and our food was wrong and he doesn't get it that we make sure he has a place keep going I had to tell him I were going to have to call my bank and let them take care of it since he refuses"}
{"text":"I picked up lunch at Mr. Sandwich today (after ordering online via Yelp!). I arrived about 5 minutes after placing my order, knowing that I would have to wait for a while, but it took an extra 10-15 minutes for my order of grilled chicken with rice, beef pho, and Thai tea. My only complaint is the wait time. The food itself is SUPERB and the food portions greatly exceeded my expectations. I definitely recommend the grilled chicken with rice (it comes with two huge chicken thighs, cut up veggies, and piles of fresh rice), as well as the beef stew pho (which came with a whopping container of savory broth, a pile of noodles and veggies, and delicious tender beef). The portions are so large that I shared the beef stew pho with my sister and we didn't even finish it. Of course my favorite thing about Mr. Sandwich is their Thai tea, which is authentic, sweet, and perfectly chilled. I definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone searching for authentic pho and boba."}
{"text":"This place rocks .  When u first walk in the smell gets you right away. It's like a traditional Vietnamese pho restaurant, yummy smells.  We ordered the spring rolls and they were awesome. 
 Also ordered the combination bahn mi and the chicken one. Bread is good, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  You won't go wrong coming here, prices are cheap too."}
{"text":"Wow how much I missed this sandwich the #37 charbroiled Beef all I can say is YUMMY had too go back for a second"}
{"text":"My friend always liked going here so I finally decided to come with her. Their menu has a lot to offer from banh mis' to pho. 

I ordered their bbq pork banh mi and pho dac biet. My friend ordered the same thing. I was excited since it is just across UNLV. 

First of, service are horrible! We had to wait for about 30 minutes for our food, no water offered! 30 minutes wait for a sandwich. 
Second, when we got our sandwiches, the pork was raw, looks like it was rushed & there was a hair on it. 
I could not eat the food anymore because I felt really disgusting. 
The pho was the same thing, rushed and did not have any taste. So bland. 

Lastly, the place is disgusting too. 

I am honestly not coming back here! 
To anyone, not worth your money. I'd rather take my car, drive down one more street to get a better vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Egg rolls were average and the charbroiled pork sandwich tasted bland. I have had better. No fountain drinks."}
{"text":"Banh MI is awsome and I love that they have the avocado smoothies with lychee jelly!  I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and my delivery number was misplaced so I called the restaurant and they told me the wrong apt number said a man came in and said he was picking it up instead. I told him that wasn't me he kept saying the same address took almost 2hrs for my order to come to me and I only live 10mn away. Wouldn't recommend their delivery service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my pho soup at such a reasonable price of 6 dollars and how close it is to campus but I would not recommend going here for Bobas. My issue is that the boba I got here last time had way too many ice which then filled majority of my cup and watered down the flavor. The cup sizes were too overpriced in my opinion and the way they make Bobas aren't quality in taste in my opinion. It would help if they took better time making the Bobas good and putting less ice."}
{"text":"Probably the worst pho place I've gone to. Order the pho Togo and when I got home the pho broth wasn't even hot, it was room temp. Ordered a durian smoothie and right when the lady brought it to me, I tasted it and immediately told her that it was not durian and she said that it was and that they were using the powder. It tasted like mango or something and overly sweet. I've been having diarrhea all day after eating the pho. NEVER AGAIN THAT IM GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't get the vegan pho. It's super boring. I'll bet their other vegans items are delicious, but I have yet to try them. Until then, this place is just okay."}
{"text":"I guess since I had at least 3 check ins I can write a review. Honestly the only reason I come here is because it's the closest boba place to me. I live close to Sam Boyd Stadium and we have no boba place in The Henderson area. With that being said. That's mainly why i continue to come here. The milk teas are good don't get me wrong. The boba though , way overlooked and mushy. Seems to be the story of my life. They have food too but I've yet to try anything other than the milk teas. They have pho for $6 a bowl. Pretty cheap but with Pho Thang Huong across the way I doubt I will try the pho  or order from the food menu. Maybe I'll try a Bahn minor something someday but today we will just talk milk tea. 

Here's the deal. I've become obsessed with milk tea. I just love it ! Refreshing and sweet. I just can't do without the boba and I crave milk tea all the time so when I'm close I frequent this location. I've had the mango milk tea , jasmine milk tea and Thai milk tea. The jasmine would probably be my favorite of the three. Most of the drinks are made from powder :/ They have different jellies and bobas including green apple boba flavored Jellies and popping bobas. Small is $3 medium is $4 and large is $5. The milk teas aren't bad I just wish the texture was more firm on the boba. So far kung fu tea is killing the boba game and everyone needs to take notes :/"}
{"text":"Great service. The staffs are really friendly and the food is great. I usually come here during my break between classes. Their coffee is like crack. It's amazing. I don't think I would survive my afternoon class without it."}
{"text":"I love this place.   It is really dicey,  but the staff are really nice and the food is awesome.   If you're into bubble tea / Boba,  they have a great variety and well.   Mostly this place reminds me of the place that would feed me for weeks at a time because it was across from my apartment in Toronto."}
{"text":"Today is a beautiful day. Bright and sunny skies. I walked into this little French-Vietnamese restaurant hoping for some decent food. It is definitely filled with plenty of college students. I ordered the Charbroiled Banh Mi - #36. It came out warm with what seems like only a few vegetables and pork. Unfortunately, I was correct. However, for $3.50, you get what you paid for. The sandwich was okay, not impressive. This is in a university area, so perhaps their target audience are poor college students. Don't expect anything great. Only expect food to be ready and cheap. 

Service- almost nonexistent
Cleanliness -great
Food -meh
Decor -cool."}
{"text":"Currently eating my rare steak and brisket pho. Not gonna lie it's pretty good. Can't wait to try more off the menu. Service was good and quick."}
{"text":"Usually my boyfriend and I come for the banh mi. I thought I'd try the bun bo hue this time. It was really disappointing. The soup was plain and tasted nothing like bun bo hue. The soup usually has a distinct lemongrass smell that was missing also. The meats they used are ones that are to be eaten with pho too. I think I'll just stick with the banh mi from here."}
{"text":"I used to come here for pho, Bahn mi, and boba tea drinks but after they opened, the honeymoon phase ended. Service wasn't up to par or quick as it was the first time they opened. During my last visit I ordered pho and found a fly in my soup, I'm pretty aware of my surroundings so I could shoo a fly away from my food instantly without it landing in my bowl. Plus, once it was given to me it was the first thing I seen! Ew! I told the cashier so they were aware and all they did was apologize, they didn't offer to replace it. However, being the hangry woman I am I scooped that fly out and ate my pho. It wasn't satisfying at all, it was a filler for my hunger especially how they didn't offer to make me a new soup. Before this incident I should have known that this restaurant was dirty because in the past their veggies that they serve you before your soup comes out would be wilted, brown, or mashed/ soggy looking, and I found green worms on the lettuces. Please fix *some of the employee's service and the food handling process!"}
{"text":"This place is a must stop for vegas. The sandwich is crispy and soft. Whatever sandwich you order add egg makes it even better!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE costumer service. The older cashier lady is super rude . It's musty in there and super dirty."}
{"text":"Ok but not great. 
Counter help was occupied  with her cel phone. The sandwich was ok, the bread was fresh but the pork was bland. My soup was also bland, thankfully there was chili sauce on the table."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food, sauces not right. Service almost non-existent. Not filthy, but not very clean either. No Asians working in an Asian restaurant is sufficient cause to turn around and walk out. I won't go back."}
{"text":"A few friends of mine love the sandwiches from here. With \"sandwich\" as part of the business name they ought to have great sandwiches, right?

The meat to bread ratio is disproportionate. You're paying about $5 a sandwich and meat is pricey - you get what you pay for.

What really bothers me is how cramped and dirty this place is. They open at 9am and I'd get here just a few minutes after they open and it's already messy? And nobody seems to care.

Sure, it's only across the street from UNLV but I'd rather drive a block away for better Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"pho and sandwich, its OK but nothing special. It's little pricey than average of Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese restaurant on the east side next to UNLV for pho & banh mi. Large selection of food, affordable prices, and fast service. Egg rolls are on point. The Vietnamese coffee come in various sizes to keep you awake all night for that all nighter when you be studying for the finals. They also cater/deliver food if needed. Vegetarian dishes are available and delicious as well. I usually order the pho Dac biet, cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"I dunno how the food is, because it NEVER arrived! I put an order in about 2 hrs ago. They said it'll be ready in 20 and should be here in less than 40. I waited an hour, called and no answer. Called again, still no answer and just checked... They closed 7 mins ago. Now I'm starving and need to leave for work on no an empty stomach. Awesome"}
{"text":"Vegan Vietnamese Bahn Mi & Vegan Boba Options all for under $10 bucks!? SOLD!

I've discovered this hole in the wall place by UNLV, was hooked on their Lavender Slush Almond Milk boba after I found out they used almond milk instead of soy milk! I love that they have a stamp card to redeem more boba drinks when you go often. 

I had the Vegan Tofu Vietnamese Bahn Mi once as a to go order and it was the most amazing sandwich EVER! It has peanut sauce in it, but this recent visit in store, I was looking forward to the same thing and it was missing the sauce. Good thing my friend ordered the spring rolls that came with the peanut sauce so I just added it to my sandwich. I also tried the vegan veggie pho, it was kind of bland as for the broth, but once you add the hoisin sauce & sirracha, it balances it out. 

Only place to get fast food and vegan options near the university!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to get Pho around UNLV. It's good food, great service, a comfortable setting. Best place to go especially when the winter hits"}
{"text":"Service is great! The nice lady was too cute, and the Pad Thai was superb! First time here but can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My go to Vietnamese spot in Vegas. Accurate, friendly, quality food. No gimmicks, no frills, just authentic food with quality service to back it up. 5 stars all the way for this eatery! My IG/Twitter is @dabvandamme - follow me!"}
{"text":"Went here while at UNLV for a course nearby. They do have a wide variety of options on their menu to choose, from pho to chinese to Thai dishes. The staff is nice and its close to UNLV if you are in the area. The inside was pretty small and really warm, was the ac broken maybe?

I had the pad kee mao (thai dish) and it came with vegetables. It was rather plain, as in no spice, but was okay. A lot of vegetables inside, peppers, bok choy and basil so you better like them. It was alright but nothing special. I would only go here again if I was in the area and everything else to eat was closed."}
{"text":"Cheap price, catered to college student, but horrible service and management. Waited 45 min for takeout only to have them pack up my meal the second I approached the counter with receipt. Maybe you should realize something is wrong when they are staring at you from the table for half an hour."}
{"text":"This place is really convenient and cheap next to the UNLV campus. I ordered the massaman curry with chicken and my friend ordered the beef spring rolls and the shrimp pad Thai. The beef spring rolls were actually pretty tasty and different from the usual shrimp spring rolls. The curry tasted ok but it was really watery and typically massaman curry has potatoes in it but the only thing that was in it was carrots and chicken. The flavor was decent though but I guess I was just expecting more. It's good for a cheap bite to eat and I'm curious how their boba is."}
{"text":"Very yummy reasonable prices.    Great food.   Very international menu.....staff speak English...Vietnamese and Spanish. But menu includes French/Vietnamese, Korean and Thai dishes.   Lots of pictures so you can see what you will get....I asked loads of questions so I could eat glutten free and various staff were very helpful....it's in the college district.  So they have sandwiches under $4.  But the soups are all $7 and up.   BoBas. on display but I didn't even ask if you can get them sugar free....No one bothered me about taking my time and hanging out.   Next to an awesome wells Fargo bank And a usps office with no line.  Helpful honest friendly staff...."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend who had a coupon for a \"buy 5, get 1 free\" sandwich.  I was not expecting much, but was pleasantly  surprised.  
It's a small cozy restaurant next to einsteins bagel and I noticed that some patrons were studying on their laptops.  

The menu pretty big, ranging from pho to finger food snacks.  The staff was friendly and hospitable and recommended us to get the house special and charbroiled chicken sandwich (which was delicious!).  We dined in.  It was kind of empty but it did not feel awkward hanging out there.  It was actually warm, comfortable and had enough background noise and space to feel like you can have some privacy for conversation. 

Overall it was a great experience.  I like their sandwiches and their Vietnamese coffee!"}
{"text":"Get #43 with extra meat (only $1 more). Best customer service. Best sandwich I have had in Vegas. Never leave reviews but it was THAT good. Do yourself a favor and go."}
{"text":"Great Won Ton Soup + Fast delivery service:) 
Delivery guy didn't have change, so he just credited me for the next time."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and between classes at UNLV this is an alright place to eat.  I've eaten here a few times and I've found a majority of the other reviewers are spot on about this place. The food isn't bad by any stretch, it just isn't good either, and there is much better Vietnamese food around the corner if you're willing to walk a little further.

The restaurant is dirty.  I suspect it's because they're usually busy from the student rush and they appear to be severely understaffed.  If you order water, don't expect a refill.  Your food might come before your drinks, and you might need to loot forks and/or napkins from nearby tables.

Additionally, there are a few homeless men who linger around this general area due to the location near the school and on Maryland Pkwy.  When I was there one of these men entered the restaurant through a side door and just sort of wandered around a bit before wandering out another door.  Things like that just add to the chaos of this place.

Overall, the food isn't bad, and they have a large variety of smoothies.  If you're on campus and you only have a short amount of time, this isn't a bad place to go fill up for the rest of your classes."}
{"text":"Very good! And being $5.99 for a decent sized bowl, I'm very satisfied. Causal environment too"}
{"text":"Went to mr sandwich for the first time (finally) after having driven by every day since they opened. We had a sandwich (Banh mi) and a beef stew soup as well as an order of summer rolls and it was all delicious. We are definitely going to go back to try more stuff from the very larger menu."}
{"text":"Eeeh. Food is whatever. Theres another vietnamese restaurant a block across that I always go to, decided to explore this one, im sticking to the one across the block. This one doesn't have anything worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Mediocre Vietnamese sandwiches and spring rolls. For the price you pay and the quality you get, it's fine. It's not something I'd go out of my way for. We ordered food here because it's an UberEats location. If you need a cheap and quick bite to eat, then this satisfies. If you want decent Vietnamese food, I'd go look elsewhere.

Would not recommend their spring rolls. It's just lettuce, noodles, and a little bit of meat."}
{"text":"In short: Usually good sandwiches.  You'll probably be happy if you come for lunch, but the employees like to go home by 8 so don't come after 7:30 pm and you should be fine.

The longer version:

I usually really like this place.  I was all about their brisket bánh mì.  The french bread is softer than most places in town and very reasonably priced too!

But after tonight I won't be going back.  They ruined by sandwich by soaking it in sriracha and hoisin sauce.  I had to actually remove some of the bread to get it off and to be able to taste the meat over the sriracha.  I wonder if that was a passive aggressive move by the employees because of tonight's events:

At 7:50 my boyfriend called them to put in a to go order.  They said they couldn't because they were closing.  He asked, \"Don't you close at 9?\" They then said they would take the order if he could get there in 10 minutes. \"Ok\" When he got there he asked if they changed their closing time and they told him that only tonight they would be closing at 8. Hmmm..."}
{"text":"Prices - very good.  Quality of ingredients, ok but not impressive.  My sandwich has lots of gristle or tendon which made for an off putting texture.  The rest of my sandwich wasn't bad, and spring rolls were ok.  If not for the awesome prices, I would have given a 2.5 if possible."}
{"text":"This place is directly across the street from UNLV, and directly across from my specific college so it's never a trek if I want to stop by. With that being said, after my first stop here, this place has never been a place I've chosen to go to, it's just been more of a place I end up at due to circumstances. It's not bad, but it's not good either. It just sort of exists. The pho is slightly below average; the broth has no flavor and the sandwiches are about average. You'll eat the meal, but nothing has ever stood out and made me want to return here. The staff has never been good or bad. They've never wowed me, but never been rude or unpleasant. If you're at UNLV and you absolutely have to have pho or banh then they'll do, but there's entirely too many alternatives without even leaving the parking lot"}
{"text":"It's a good and cheap place. For a college student I am not complaining because I love Asian food and this is the worst. I actually liked it, to be honest. They make my orders quick and they seem nice too. Better than I expected hehe"}
{"text":"It's hit or miss with the service here but the food is good for the price. I go here sometimes when I'm craving Vietnamese food. Don't get fooled by the name, they sell way more than just sandwiches here. I've only had two of their sandwiches which is the charbroiled beef and the pork. The sandwiches are really good for less than $5! Beats Subway mostly cause a 6 inch is not enough and a 12 inch is too much and they no longer have the $5 foot longs. Anyways, I love the bread they use because it's crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. I've also had their pho and other dishes, and so far I have yet to have a bad experience. 

As far as he service goes, it's hit or miss. When the boss is there, the service is great! He's kind and will take care of you right away. Last time I was here, I literally waited for over 10 minutes at the counter to order whilst the two workers fail to acknowledge me. It was only when I left the counter to complain to my friend about leaving, when one of the guys finally take my order.

I'll be back again. Hopefully I have a better service experience next time."}
{"text":"Crumbs everywhere! That's the story of my lunch. I was craving banh mi and since I'm a big fan of the Mr Sandwich on Spring mountain I was happy to have a location open up on the East side. Came here around lunch time and they were pretty busy. Mostly people ordering pho on this cold day, but I was in a rush and just ordered the charbroiled pork banh mi and a taro milk tea with boba. 

The sandwich was just ok. The bread was way too crumbly and made a mess every time I took a bite, which was annoying. Tasted slightly stale as well, which was disappointing. The meat and veggies were ok. Wish they were a little more pickled to add more flavor, but still ok. 

The milk tea was good and basic. Would have been a little better if they added more ice, but I enjoyed it.

Overall, I don't see myself going out of my way to come here, but it's a good addition to the area."}
