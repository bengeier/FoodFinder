{"text":"If you want to try a new place with authentic food, this is the place. Awesome. Everything was great. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow!  I don't write many yelp reviews but this place deserves one. I travel for work and eat out daily. It is a challenge to find great food but this place has it. The broiled flank steak with creole sauce rice & plantains is outstanding. Mix the rice with the unique beans and add the Aji sauce on top of the steak or the rice & beans. I will be back if my travels take me anywhere near Casa Columbia."}
{"text":"Great authentic Columbian food. My boyfriend and I ( He's from Columbia ) found this little out of the way place from a coupon booklet I have and decide to give it a try. We used to think Pio Pio had the best food but this place does everything from scratch. All the food was fresh and hot and the chicken with mushroom sauce was excellent. Carlos the owner brought me some hot chicken soup he made from scratch to eat while we waited on our food, also delicious. He said they never serve anything from a can all is homemade and makes corn cakes and grinds his own meal. He was very friendly and sat and talked to us while we enjoyed our food and told us he learned to cook from a very young age from his grandmother and mother in the kitchen when he lived in Columbia. Very sweet man. So many good things to say about this place. We will certainly be eating here often."}
{"text":"I was so surprised to find this Colombian restaurant in the middle of nowhere but definitely worth the drive the food was awesome and the owner and his wife are very sweet people LOVE this place"}
{"text":"Love this 'find' south of Ballantyne. Food was fresh, delicious and filling. Homemade soups made daily. The owners provide a personal and engaging experience."}
{"text":"Where to start! All I can say is horrible experience.

Our waitress was completely clueless from the start. She had no idea about any items on the menu and completely screwed up our order numerous times. After we put our orders in soup and entree's . Half an hour goes by and........entrees come out when I ask about soup they go oh yeah they proceed
 To bring soup out together with entrees that's a big no no to me. They see I'm visibly upset and ask if everything is ok?i tell her no and she responds sorry !  Like that is supposed to make it better at which point the owner lady comes out and asks me what's wrong. As I tell her she responds with sorry she's new and I'm like and?.... She like that's it I respond that sorry is not good enough to which she tells me she won't be spoken to this way instead of offering to take our entrees back and warm it up and comp something like anyone else would do she says eat your food and leave before I say something I shouldn't say!!!! Is that customer service? Is that what I payed good money for? A pleasurable  dining experience perhaps no? Eat and leave lol. Then husband comes out and I waste my breath explaining to him the story to which he responds so what you want me to pack you up and give you the meal for free? I mean seriously?!?!?!?
As I leave she says she feels sorry for my kid!!!!

Never have I dined in such a place with low class and clueless customer relations tactics. I will never return here and will make sure that anyone I speak to knows about how poorly they treated me on a night with 3 tables you would think they'd be thankful and extra on top of business matters.

Stay away I sure will!!"}
{"text":"Real Colombian food with an excellent service. The maduros, my favorites are always good."}
{"text":"The service was amazing! The owner came out and greeted us personally and waited on us. Truly amazing Colombia food. We traveled all the way from mint hill because we have tried almost every Colombian restaurant in the charlotte area and haven't found one that really spoke to us. This truly tastes like grandmas food and that's what we are looking for In a Colombian restaurant, apart from feeing at home with the exceptional service we were given. You have to try this hidden gem! And don't forget to ask for the plantains!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, amazing and tastes like it was made with such love and care! The restaurant is so cozy and the owners are the sweetest and most caring people I've met in ages. My wife and I loved it and will be back all the time!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I love all the hidden gems in Indian Land. First the owners are awesome. Super kind and willing to help you make an informed decision about the menu. 

Let me say that everything in here is so fresh! We started of with the chicken empanadas. Omg, they taste better than my Mamacita's, but don't tell her. I had the mushroom chicken dish which was outstanding... The sauce was simply dreamy... I'm not joking.

The hubs got the number 1. For a point of reference- we came back the next day and he ordered it again, to go. We came to ordered the oxtail soup... speechless

We topped off our meals by sharing a tres leche...bless the hands that prepared this food."}
{"text":"What an unexpected pleasure.  Great food and large serving size.  The owner was very involved, he even made a great suggestion for preparing my leftovers the next day.  
I tried the typical Columbian dinner with some carne asida, red sausage, avocado, pork back, an egg, sweet plantains, rice, beans, and traditional Columbian corn bread. Tres Leches for desert.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down Best Colombian restaurant in the Carolinas. 100% authentic for those of us that are Colombianos. Sad to see people that are clueless on Hispanic food give bad reviews on this place because they are way off.  They should learn about other cultures. Highly recommended! My new favorite Colombian restaurant in town. Everything is home made from scratch."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Delicious.  The plantains were on point!  The fried pork loin was amazing!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"fter reading the reviews I was a little nervous, but I stopped in last week to check it out and pick up a menu.  I thought the place looked clean and the staff was very nice.  We dined in tonight and it was DELICIOUS!  The waitress was very helpful in explaining the menu items and offering advice!  We ordered a bunch of the sides and they even brought us a full cup of soup to try on the house.  The waitress kept referring to \"him\" like a one man show in the kitchen.  Then \"he\" came out.  He is the owner, chef and dishwasher he told us.  He was very friendly and encouraged us to try to the condiments on the table, which were also very good. I have no complaints and very happy we stopped in.  We will definitely good back soon."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant!! The most delicious and authentic Colombian cuisine around! And the owner is so kind and helpful!"}
{"text":"This place was ridiculous. The waitress had no idea what was going on. I guess that's ok since she was new. But no one took responsibility or tried to reasonably rectify the situation. The food tasted awful. Half our order was forgotten, and the list goes on and on and on and on as to how poorly this place is run. Definitely won't be returning here."}
{"text":"All you can MEAT is all I can say about this.  They give you HUGE portions for your money, so definitely split a meal if you have someone with you.  We took a to go box and ate off that for a few meals, ha!  The food is very rich and a lot of it is fried, so you'll be all set if you're trying to carb load for an athletic event.   The plantains and yucca were really good, and the leftover pork made for great ingredients in my stew later in the week.  The fresh juices here were really good too."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great kitchen, service, people, ambiance, value. It feels as if one is in  Colombian village. The chef-owner is very accomplished, his wife is a great hostess. Worth making the trek."}
{"text":"Excellent experience, great food, extremely friendly service!  I stopped in for my first dining experience at Casa Columbia this week during lunch hours.  We were seated, drinks delivered and food ordered in less than 5 minutes.  I ordered the #1 special and it was phenomenal!  When the rice and beans are superb, you know you came to the right place. The plate also came with a variety of meats, an egg and some delicious plantains, as well a as a type of corn bread.  Great find that you will not be disappointed in trying!"}
{"text":"I don't often get a chance to try Colombian food but when I do I visit Casa Colombia. I've read other reviews about the waitress and how how clueless she is but I found her very engaging and friendly. Yes she is new but Casa Colombia is new also so what's the real deal folks. I found the atmosphere to be quaint and charming with a real touch of Colombia. The food is delicious and freshly cooked to order, the chef as others have stated is engaging also with a desire to make sure you enjoy your meal. 

This menu has many different options to choose from and in my opinion you really can't go wrong with your choice. This place is definitely worth trying and don't let some reviewers dissuade you from enjoying the atmosphere and the food here. I highly recommend a visit and with this being a new restaurant to the area we should definitely support them. Good Luck Casa Colombia."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Got the chicken with mushroom sauce, which was actually really good. However the rice, beans, and plantains were bland. Prices were high for the quality of the food. For those prices I expect a little more. Price range was $11-$20 for entrees. Would not recommend unless you just love Colombian food."}
{"text":"We passed by this little restaurant a few weeks ago and decided to give it a try tonight. When we walked in we were immediately greeted by the owner who was very welcoming. He brought us a plate of two different kinds of plantains as well as fried yucca on the house. Everything tasted fresh with authentic flavors. The beef broth soup was outstanding; there were giant pieces of tender beef in a flavorful broth. We both got the rotisserie chicken with rice and beans. The outside of the chicken was slightly fried which kept the meat tender and moist. At the end of our meal, the owner told us about the selection of desserts, one of which being the tres leches cake, homemade by his wife. It was sweet but not overpowering and a wonderful consistency. For such delicious food and generous portions, this meal definitely did not break the bank. We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"This is an authentic Colombian restaurant, from the model houses on the walls to the flavor. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a taste of home."}
{"text":"The food here was really good, and the service was great...the owner is really nice and comes out to greet the customers.  I would come  back and eat here if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Colombian food.  No category on the drop-down.

Great menu with the bandeja, also known as a Paisa, this is the huge sampler with beans, rice, steak, sausage, crackling pork egg, sweet fried plantains, avocado and a corn arepa the common \"bread\" of Colombians.  8 plates of other native dishes, 6 chicken plataes, salads, four fish plates, three other steak dishes and a kid menu.  Of course, desserts, like flan, figs with milk candy and cheese and the rich creamy dish, tres leches (three milks).

Good job, having visited Colombia, in covering the spectrum of dishes.  Beer and wine and specialty sodas from Colombia and Spain.  

Take out menu.

Dinners range from $13 - $15, kid menu from $5 - $6.

Lots of things to experiment with that are truly Colombian:  plantain dishes and a variety of sausages with arepas.  Drink beer, chat and nosh.  A good introduction to Colombia.

One note:  Colombia is a great place to visit.  The Spanish they speak is \"text book\" as you learn in school...easier to understand.  It is amazingly clean wherever you go.  Friendly people who will ask you where are the American tourists and we mention the news clips of the drug wars in Medellin and Cali.  That is gone, with FARC guerrillas only in the southwest.  Beautiful country and worth a visit.  We will most likely return.

Casa Colombia is a great find on Hwy 521, just south of the NC/SC border."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. The food is good and the owner/cook is very welcoming. He came to our table multiple times and brought us different items to try. The bandeja Paisa was really good and huge!!!! The beef empanadas and arepas were delicious. Very clean place. I will def be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Delicious empanadas, roasted chicken, pork loin, plantains, flan and tres leches cake. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Really liked this place a lot. I got the #5, I believe, and really enjoyed it. It came with a beef broth soup with rice and potatoes, and that was probably one of my favorite things. The plantains were really tasty, too. They also have a cilantro lime type of sauce that went great with pretty much everything. We got flan for desert, and it was awesome. More like a cheesecake texture than what is normally served, but that's my preference. For the money, you get a ton of food. 

Super strange for a restaurant like this to exist in Indian Land, but all the better. I'll definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Best authentic Colombian restaurant in this area. I have been to all. The menu contains a broad selection of Colombian dishes that are second to none. The staff was helpful and courteous in explaining the dishes. 
I was totally impressed and would recommend Casablanca Colombia to all my friends!"}
{"text":"LOVE the Milanesa, plantains, rice & beans! All cooked to order, so extremely fresh and delicious! It's a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time after seeing on Yelp. I used to live in Florida and was spoiled with good Latin food everywhere. Food was delicious and authentic. Large portions. Owner was extremely friendly and made us feel welcome. So happy to have found this gem in our backyard in Indian Land. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place opened in Indian Land.  We love Colombian Food. We've been here a bunch of times.  The owner is really nice and very generous.  He's given us soup and samples of his Fantastic desserts for free.  The soup is ALWAYS great and the desserts are AMAZING!  I couldn't choose which one I love best.  When we come, my favorite entree is the Mushroom Chicken.  It is superb! My son always gets the breaded steak, sweet plantains, red beans, and white rice.  My husband always gets the Number 1.  We LOVE this place, really.  It is always wonderful and so much food.  The next day, we mix every leftover into a pan, add a couple of eggs and stick it into a tortilla.  Good times!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Got the #1 plate which is a typical Columbian sampling. Definitely recommend this. My friend got the #11 I think which is grilled chicken, rice, etc. with a mushroom sauce on the side. Good, homemade sauce. 

I recommend getting the beans on the side like we did, and I'm glad I did because the beans were a bit watery and I didn't care for the flavor all that much. But still, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We enjoy Colombian food so we decided to try this restaurant for Sunday dinner. Very friendly service and our waiter  answered all our menu questions . Booths and tables in a small but comfortable  atmosphere. 
The menu features considerable  Columbian sides such as fried yucca, empanadas, arepas, tostones, sweet fried plantains to name a few. Entrees of chicken, fish and steak, fried or grilled,  accompanied with rice, beans,salad,  some with either fried cassava or fried plantains .
The rotisserie chicken was briefly deep fried only  to crisp the skin, an accident when some chicken fell in the deep fryer, tasted and then became the only way to prepare the chicken,  as told to us by Carlos the owner. He also mentions the chicken is a favorite  menu item of his customers.
The food was plated nicely, came out hot, and quickly.
First the beans were brought out in small bowls, almost tasted like a soup and very delicious. The chicken with crisp skin and moist meat. The steak dinners tender. Food mostly seasoned with salt and pepper, as well as the delicious white rice.  Fried plantains, tostones,  and yucca all delicious.
Prices are moderate but good plated portions.
Hoping to try the tres leches dessert another time as they were out of it and explained they are closed Monday and wanted to have fresh desserts during the week. 
Casa Colombia also features a kids menu. Beer, wine and  specialty sodas offered.
Also Colombian breakfast as well as American  breakfasts will  be  offered starting at the end of April.
We will be back to try that!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm from NYC and I'm half Puerto Rican and being in charlotte I miss the ease of finding authentic Latin food. Mexican is great but the way they cook vs island cooking is just not the same so I was thrilled to have found this gem! The food is delicious and the portions are great for sharing. The staff and owner are super friendly and make you feel like you walked in to their home to have dinner. If you haven't tried it yet then no need to wait any longer! Oh! And the Tres Leche is some of the best I've ever had and I've had a lot! :-)"}
{"text":"Consistently fantastic and fresh food. Service has always been wonderful. We love the food so much that we have gotten large amounts for parties --our friends flip over the food and become regulars there as well. We particular love the empanadas and broiled flank steak in creole sauce with plantains. The best place in Indian Land, SC hands-down"}
{"text":"This is the best Colombian restaurant in the area. The food is tasty and generous.  I wish they offer more Colombian food variety like  sancocho or ajIaco. On other hand, The location is hard to get to because it is far away from any interstate road."}
{"text":"First of all this is in Indian Land oppose to Fort Mill. I was hoping for a more pleasant experience since we never tried Colombian food but the whole ordeal left us feeling disappointed. We ordered the traditional Colombian platter which is #1 on the menu. It was okay but not something I would rave about. Everything was the bit of the dry side. When we asked for any traditional sauces the server simply said we are dried out. It was only lunch time. Another thing we couldn't help but notice was our server's demeanor. When I would ask a question about the dish she seemed very unexcited. When we said thank you we heard nothing back each time. She made it kind of awkward so that did not enhance our experience."}
{"text":"excellent food and a lot of it!!  the braised flank steak in creole sauce (Sobrebarriga en Salsa Criolla) was really good and if you order the #1 (Bandeja Tipica Combiana), be prepared to take some home.. it was HUGE!! The pork cracklin' was particularly fantastic.

best part of going to the restaurant was the owner coming to our table, recognizing we were first time customers and going out of his way to make my 6 year old a child sized combo plate of Colombian food as opposed to the American food that inhabits the kids menu."}
{"text":"The food here was DELICIOUS, we went around 2pm, not busy at all. The owner (I assume he was the owner) came out and talked to us, just as if we come there all the time, it was our first time. I would def recommend this place, we will be going back. 

Only downside, they were out of of the rotisserie chicken, we got the grilled chicken which was just as good but really had my taste buds set on rotisserie. Which is okay, all the reason to go back."}
{"text":"Food = B+
Service = F
Restaurant was only 1/3 full at the time I was there for lunch.

Not great for lunch - I work on Red Ventures Drive in SC (10 minutes away) and I have 1 hour for lunch.  Waiting 30 minutes for my food from order to receipt - unacceptable.  This restaurant operates in the lunch space, there are many options around for lunch, and as such it is fine that they are not at fast food speed, but most people don't get a 1.5 hours for lunch they get 1 hour.  To relax, order, eat and pay I would have needed 1.5 hours here.  As such I shoved some food in my mouth, boxed the rest and maybe will eat it later today.

Ask what they are out of - I advised the waitress that it was my first time there.  What were the most popular food items? Roasted Chicken and Bandeja Tipica.  About 5 minutes later when I attempted to order the Roasted Chicken she advised me at that point that they were out of chicken.  Maybe that would have been good information when she was telling me the most poplar item on the menu was the Roasted Chicken???

Restaurant does NOT provide everything promised on the menu - I ordered the Bandeja Tipica which is says \"avocado\" in the items provided for the meal.  No avocado came.  When I called after I'd left the restaurant, the waitress told me that the avocados were hard so they couldn't use them.  How about telling me that when she delivered my food?  Maybe sub a side salad or additional plantains?  I paid for a full meal not a partial one.

Angry New York Waitress - Thinking the waitress was not at fault for the slowness, but rather the kitchen I still gave her a 20% tip.  Unfortunately that was a mistake because when I called to ask about the incomplete order she decided to argue with me.  She told me that the avocados were hard and she then decided to also state that they were not a fast food restaurant and that that 15 minutes was not too long to wait.  Sorry, but I watched the clock and from 12:15 to 12:45 is how long I had to wait for my food.  I appreciate she's a New Yorker, but we aren't in New York.

They need a lunch menu - $20.00 is too much to pay for lunch.  My Bandeja Tipica was $13.99 plus $1.12 in tax plus a $3.00 tip which came to $18.11 total.  They need options that are from $7.00 to $10.00 that are smaller combo items.

What I would order if I came for dinner - 
* Steak
* Crackling pork
* Plaintains
* Rice
* Arepa

What I would sub or not order at all - 
* Beans
* Red sausage"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Colombian food. Service is great, the owner runs the kitchen and is very friendly, he came out asked how everything was and told us about the handbags hanging up around the restaurant (and made sure to mention they were for sale). 

Colombiana auténtica, muy deliciosa. Servicio ejemplarmente. En mi opinión, es mejor que otros restaurantes Colombianos en el área Charlotte."}
{"text":"Tons of meat selections on one plate. It reminds me of TX with the crackling pork, sausage, and steak all in one meal. First time having Colombian food. I loved it. They also have specials during the week. I want to try their oxtail soup. The owners make you feel at home like you are at their house.I recommend this place."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The portions are very generous and the food is delicious.  My wife always gets the grilled chicken and my son oves the columbiana soda"}
{"text":"Very fresh and yummy! The plantains were wonderful as was the yuca! I had the Carne Asada and it was very tasty! I have to say the service was impeccable!! I can't wait to come back and try another item on the menu !"}
{"text":"Colombian Food just wasn't on our radar, so it took us a while to try Casa Colombia on Highway 521 in Fort Mill.  My husband and I decided to go tonight.  It was wonderful!  I had the breaded steak, sweet plantains, red beans, and white rice.  My husband had the number 1.  They were Fabulous!  Before our entrees, we had salad and pea soup.  Both were great but, the pea soup was excellent. Neither one of us has had pea soup in years.  It was really delicious with just enough kick.  You could tell it was made with fresh ingredients.  The owner and chef was kind enough to give us some to bring home.  We can't wait to have it for lunch.  I highly recommend this place and will most definitely be back."}
