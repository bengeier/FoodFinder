{"text":"All we needed was a quick sandwich. SO glad we picked this place! We ate in, the server was super nice, and the had exactly what we wanted. Dr.browns, good bread, fast. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food here is delish, but best if you probably sit and eat. I made a take out order through phone, 15 minutes before I got there, ended up waiting for a good 30 mins when I got there before I got my food, it was just a chicken salad sandwich."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  I started going to Chris' about a month after I moved to Charlotte in 1994.  I was working at Lebo's down the street and a coworker took me there for lunch.  Right away I fell in love with the place and the people.  Very friendly service.  I ordered the steak hoagie with chips and a sweet tea.  Ever since I have been hooked!!  I loved meeting the owner and his sons!  They make it really fun to go there, grab lunch, and just hang for a while.  The chicken and rice soup is something I get EVERY time I go!!  This place is a must try if you haven't yet!!"}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying I am a sandwich fan. Morning,  noon and night, 24/7/365 if you ask me if I'd like a sandwich the answer will be a resounding YES. That being said, while they had plenty of sandwich options, with breads to choose from, the food was mediocre at best. The service was terrible, I actually had to get up to find my server to order dessert, an eclair; such was still frozen in there center and my server did not wash her hands before grabbing. The one redeeming quality of this run down. hole in the wall was the potato salad. It was heavenly. Not worth going back to the dirty table, hair on my soda can, and horrible service, but noteworthy regardless. If you are in need of a quick sandwich to go maybe you will have better luck than I did.   FAIR WARNING YELPERS:  Please be careful with your reviews of this place! I received a very nasty email from the \"owner\" of this place about my review. After ignoring my comments on bad service he flew into accusing my I must have been paid to write a bad review. Then was told I should pursue a career in law based on the fact I couldn't tell the truth and telling me if I wouldn't talk to him he had the right to refuse me service on future visits. After explaining my review wad based only on my visit, and offering an apology for my harsh review, he gave me his number to call and \"fix the problem\". Ewwww, no. You cant call me a liar and then lets fix it? No thanks. Key points, I have never returned since my original visit, and wasnt ever planning to. Maybe with a more customer friendly attitude, I would have been happy to give this place another shot and change my review. If a customer complains, maybe try to fix the problem? Just thought I should warn other yelpers before your message box is harassed with nasty messages. I'd post the screenshot,  of the messages; but I figured the way he chose to respond was embarassing for him enough the first time. I wish I could have liked the place, but pigs will fly before I subject myself to such bad service again, at least now I know why my server was so horrible; you are your establishment it seems."}
{"text":"Rapidly becoming my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I used to think the grilled cheese and macaroni salad was heaven, then I tried the subs...amazing. Wow, I still remember the taste...it was pretty glorious. Stop here for a little homey diner experience with great service and perfect food. The owner, Chris, is a really nice guy who knows what he's doing. Afforable and yummy!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! A must try! The turkey and tuna salad sandwiches are amazing. Definitely get a side, or two, of potato salad."}
{"text":"Best potato salad hands down! I love how this place is so consistent. Try the chicken with rice soup on a cold day!"}
{"text":"We've been eating here almost 25 years. Chris has moved the restaurant for a short time but he's back in the original location. Best chicken and rice soup ever! House roasted turkey and roast beast make great sammies. Good salads with amazing blue cheese dressing. Pretty darn good tater salad also. Long time servers, and always a steady stream of regulars. Cold beer is a plus as well."}
{"text":"Had the Pastrami on Rye and the Baklava. It was very delicious. They have a hot spicy mustard which was very good too. Do not let the strip mall scare you away. The staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Like most say, it's a hole in the wall that survives on word of mouth since it's in an old shopping center but don't ever let that stop you. It's an old school deli where you can tell the owners take alot of pride in their food. Any sandwich is great but I love the potato salad and make sure you ask for a side of their extra spicy mustard. Wow"}
{"text":"Crazy good sandwiches for the same price as subway or jimmy johns. The Reuben was insane, & I loved my pastrami. Soups were good too! If you're craving a quality sandwich, come here!!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite deli since I first ate here in 1979.  Everything is always great!"}
{"text":"Me and my coworkers eat here about twice a month and we absolutely love it. Their potato salad, turkey subs, roast beef subs, chips with ranch dip, and chicken noodle soup is really good.  I love the homemade taste and smell of their food, and to top it off they have desserts!!!"}
{"text":"Do not let location deter you, that plaza has not been hoping for a long time.  This place survived because food is excellent and priced right for huge delicious sandwiches.  Roast beef piled high, tender and delicious.  Danish ham with mayo tomato and lettuce, can be hot or cold.  Hot does not mean grilled.  Soup of the day a must and if chicken with rice is an option, get it.   Iced tea sweetened perfectly and refills kept coming.  Nice staff and you leave stuffed in a good way.   If not for Yelp we would have missed it and worth the turn around caused by the divided road.   Caution exiting and a low vehicle or motorcycle might not like the exit on the side by restaurant.     That said food is amazing."}
{"text":"I used to eat here a lot there sub used to have more meat and the bread used to be always fresh.  Things have been change during the years.  Still a local family own business were I will be going."}
{"text":"Reallllly good sandwiches,  i love this place, just had a bad encounter with the owner one time though. Ive seen the guy on several occassions and he is nice,but this one time he basically borderline disrespected me....ugh I hate that because it has left with me with  a foul taste in my mouth for the place. HOWEVER --- I can't resist. I love this freaking place..."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. They are very consistent.  The Chris' special is my favorite. They don't skimp on the meat. It's savory taste keeps me coming back. I recently discovered their chips and homemade ranch dip is completely addictive.  Place is small and always busy with repeat business."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Chris' Deli for 20 years and they never disappoint me.  I always get the roast beef sub with potato salad and trust me, it's not wimpy sandwich.  I love their potato salad too and so I always have to get that.  The place looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but trust me, good food is being made inside."}
{"text":"Chris' Deli has become a staple in my weekly work diet and can't say I'm mad about it! From salads to sandwiches, soups and pitas, this place provides comfort in something simple, convenient and CHEAP. My go-to is either the chicken salad or egg salad on pita, toasted, topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles with potato salad on the side. I always get two meals out of the $6 dish and it is always delicious! Sometimes I stray and get the greek salad or grab a soup as a side instead. Either way, I'm never disappointed. Thanks Chris' for having my back \"when\" (ahem.. because) I don't cook."}
{"text":"Old school deli is pretty good but not the best I've ever had or anything. I still don't think anybody can beat Harris Teeter as far as subs go....the chips & \"dip\" we ordered were just chips from a bag with a side of ranch lol"}
{"text":"So, I saw this place the last time I stopped at the computer store in the same strip mall and the reviews got me curious.  I had to make the trip back to the computer store and I told myself I would try these guys out the next time an opportunity arose.  I woke up this morning with a sore throat. Maybe getting sick, maybe too much drinking last night, not really sure.  I told the waitress I wasn't sure what I wanted to get; she suggested the chicken and rice soup since I wasn't feeling great. Excellent choice, it's also sold in bulk so it can be taken home. Chicken and rice was super creamy and tasty. Could use a slight bit more salt, but there was salt at the table and I'd rather it be under salted than oversalted. This may be my personal preference as well, I generally put a splash of soy sauce in my chicken and rice soup.  I got the steak and cheese, all the way, minus onions with chips. It was delicious. The waitress brought a bottle of some type of dressing which she suggested I add it, as that what she does. Really, really good. Vinaigrette type deal? I didn't hear what she said it was, but they were widely available.  On the strength of the food and other reviews, I got a BLT and potato salad to go for my mom. She doesn't like going out, but this type of food is right up her alley.  She loved it.  Great experience overall. Kinda dangerous because I need to watch my calories. They had lighter fare available.   Probably requires another trip to investigate.  Overall, really low key, really good food and apparently there's additional access via the neighborhood roads that don't require you to risk being rear-ended on Independence."}
{"text":"The closest restaurant in Charlotte to a real Deli!! I've been enjoying Chris' for 30 years. It's busy at lunch so come early but dinner is a breeze."}
{"text":"Catching up on reviews. Chris's has been around awhile now. I would think most know how good this deli is.  All the construction on Ind Blvd/74 has killed most businesses in that area. Yet Chris's still thrives and is as good as ever. Harder to get to then years ago, but well worth the effort.  The fact the construction has killed so many businesses in that area, yet they are still packed at lunch, is all you need to know.  If they laid down a mile of hot coals you had to walk thru to get there, it would be worth burning your feet to eat there.  It was one of the best deli's in Charlotte years ago and it still is.   I would list some of my fav's, but I wouldnt know where to begin. Everything is terrific.  My fav is Corned beef and pastrami with swiss and mustard on NY rye. Its fantastic. Great meat, terrific rye, thick and hearty, priced right.  My biggest problem with this place is getting there and trying to decide what I want.....  You simply cant go wrong...its all good. Easily one of the top few deli's around. Worth walking thru hot coals to get there if need be.  If you haven't tried this place your missing out. If you are trying it for the first time, beware....You will probably be eating there on a regular basis, even if you work far away. Its well worth the drive.....  Dont believe me however. Go there, try it and form your own opinion."}
{"text":"Yup its in the end of a a strip mall maybe one of the last strip malls in this area of Independence Blvd. but don't let that stop you from checking out this gem. If you want a real sub...real service...and some hot and delicious chicken and wild rice soup check out Chris'.   This place rocks when it comes to consistency I frequent here often for lunch..you can always get a seat and the waiters are friendly. You can order your sub hot or cold on all different types of breads or rolls (onion roll highly recommended). Deli meat is cut fresh big PLUS. Don't forget to ask for the horseradish mustard it is amazing."}
{"text":"If I lived in Charlotte I would probably eat here once a week or so. I love subs and growing up it was traditional to have subs once a week. This place brought me back to that time. These things are made with good flavored meat with toppings sliced just right. I asked for mine heated with toasted bread and that is just what I got. This thing was loaded with meat... no skimping out where it counts! I also ordered potato salad as my side and very much enjoyed it. It was not the best I have had but it was very good. The thing I liked the most about the potato salad was how simple/basic it was. It was not loaded with 100 different flavors or drowned in vinegar nor did it just taste like mustard. It had flavor yet you could still taste potato which I found nice since after all, it is potato salad.   My wife ordered her sandwich on an onion roll and she loved it. She got the baked beans with hers and said if you like Bush's baked beans then you would like these.   All in all, very pleasant experience. The server was very nice and the food was great. If it were not for the other reviews I would not have gone to this place. It doesn't look like much from the outside and is easy to miss. To be honest, when you walk in it won't look like much on the inside either. DO NOT let the looks fool you. I took others advice and my wife and I were more then pleased with our meal and the over all experience.  One last note... they had some decent beer and they were pretty cheap! I love beer so this was a bonus for me."}
{"text":"I really really like eating at this deli.  The sandwiches are awesome, especially the chris' special which is turkey and roast beef and provolone on a bun plus condiments, its great.  The sides are good too, the only thing that is not too good that I have tried is their pasta salad, it is very bland.  They also sell beer which is cool.  Would recommend this place!  Plus its affordable."}
{"text":"I drove past this place for almost 8 years. Which is very odd since it was within walking distance of my house. When I finally went in and had the corned beef I felt like a complete idiot.   The food here is so good. They use boar head meat, vegetable taste fresh and the bread is on point. Never been disappoint by a sandwich from here.  Their soup is a little bland but I don't mind it that way."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times, and I always leave extremely satisfied.  The corn beef on rye bread with spicy mustard in phenomenal. I also love the grilled cheese and the chicken and rice soup. I did not think I would find a deli as good as the ones back home in New York City, but Chris's is it."}
{"text":"This is a really cool and nice spot for lunch. Great coleslaw and potato salad. It's off of independence blvd so you know you'll have to deal with that depending on which direction you're arriving.   Great employees- friendly, cheerful and helpful.   Everything on the menu - melas, side items, souls are delicious.  Pay them a visit - you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!  Awesome sandwiches, fantastic sides and great service! We popped in for a quick bite on the way to a Checkers game.  Had the cheesesteak, wife had their Italian and my son had the turkey.  We also ordered their potato salad.  The sandwiches are amazing and the steak on mine was real marinated, grilled and sliced steak--not that frozen crap you get elsewhere. Potato salad is unique and incredibly delicious! Highly recommend this little gem!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten here I HIGHLY suggest you give it a try!! This place has the best potato salad, egg salad, sandwiches, soups... pretty much you order it and it's going to be awesome!! Chris' Deli has been a staple in Charlotte for as long as I can remember. It will blow any other deli out of the water in taste, quality, and cost. Seriously I can't rave about it enough. I love that you can by everything by the pint/quart as well. Seriously I'm going to have to go this weekend now lol.  The only downside is it's hard to get to since Independence underwent all the changes it has over the years.  Many many businesses have had to close up shop along that strip but Chris' Deli prevails!! *thank goodness*  You seem to be doing A-okay as their parking lot is always pretty full.  This is a hole in the wall, local kind of spot so don't expect a lot in the decor department etc. However if you are looking for amazing food this is the place to go... I mean it's a deli who cares about the decor :-)"}
{"text":"Egg salad was very good and just what I wanted.   Service was excellent, friendly and quick.  Macaroni salad was not worth serving and macaroni with mayonnaise does not make it salad.  I will return but will choose a different side."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Great little deli spot hidden in a hard to access plaza on Independence. Good food, good people and the price is right."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here but am with others (see one tip in particular left in 2014) who have mentioned that something seems amiss and angsty between ownership and staff. I walked in and placed a to go order with an older gentleman who I believe is the Chris of Chris' Deli. He immediately walked back to start making the sandwiches. I sat down to wait and suddenly overheard a staff member lose his cool and snap, \"Shut up. Just shut up. We bust our asses for you and you never even say thank you.\" Now on one hand, it's not cool to do that in front of customers. On the other hand, it's not cool for someone to be so frustrated at work that he feels he has to say that at all. The staff member came to the register to ring up another customer who was waiting and was very nice to him, and the staff member was very nice to me -- efficient, said thank you, and didn't act perturbed. I related the whole incident to my boyfriend who was surprised and said Chris had always been very nice to him whenever he was in there picking up an order.   So what gives? I have no idea what was said to the staff member. Does it take being kind of a jerk to keep a restaurant going since 1979? Probably so. Best pancake house I ever knew was run like an authoritarian regime, but employees stayed on there for years and the owner was a figurehead in the community. I don't want to feel sorry for the people who work at a place -- it makes me question what I'm supporting with my dollars. Does someone need a vacation? Management and empathy training? To just retire? Selfishly I don't want Chris' to close. The food always is great and super affordable.   Here's my thank you to those who put in hard work. I hope I'm not the only one who says it to them."}
{"text":"This is a great place to visit for your lunch break.Great prices,tasty food,and quick service.You can't beat that!!My favorite is the reuben!"}
{"text":"It hasn't changed a bit in the almost 20 years that it's been. They were the best and only real deli in town when I first moved here. Same owner and same great service and food. It is a little harder to get in and out but we'll worth the effort. They we're getting busy when I left so it's not that hard. Great pickles. My only negative is the rye bread. Wish it was real and not out of a plastic bag."}
{"text":"Until today, I hadn't been here in years. Since the widening of Independence Blvd has forced so many other businesses to close or move, I half expected Chris'  to be boarded up, too.  From the looks of the lunch crowd on a Tuesday, they haven't got anything to worry about. Got there at 12:30 and moved into a just-vacated table (seats still warm). Only seats in the place.  I had pastrami on rye with potato salad. Wife had egg salad and slaw. I would have liked a little more sandwich, but she almost couldn't finish hers.  My pastrami was as good as can be expected without going to a full-kosher NY deli (which is an unfair comparison in CLT NC, I admit). Rye was fresh, with that chewy crust (same caveats apply as with the pastrami). Mustard was spicy enough. Potato salad was good, if suspiciously like something scooped out of a restaurant supply tub.  Wife raved about her egg salad. She's something of a slaw-snob, and she was impressed. I didn't try it (didn't get a chance, it disappeared so fast), but it looked good.  Pickle spears were worth an honorable mention. Next time, they'll be ordered as an appetizer.  Waitresses were great, in a \"we can tell you're not a regular\" sort of way. Helpful and talkative.  Note: the restaurant is on the **inbound** side of Independence, before Briar Creek. Since crossing over isn't allowed along that part of the highway, plan your route accordingly,.  If you're one of those folks who has to eat in a brightly-lit, corporate, tastefully decorated environment, keep on driving. There are Jason's, Subway, etc outlets further out Independence. This place is dim and well used. You can tell that in an earlier time, the cigarette smoke would have been thick and pervasive in there.  All in all. My kind of place. The next time I'm on that side of the world, this is where I'll be."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service warm and inviting.  It is a deli, with great potato salad and chicken and rice soup! The only problem is that if you don't know to look for it you would miss it!"}
{"text":"This is a secret gem in Charlotte!  The food is delicious and the prices are awesome for the amount of food you get. Chicken salad cold plate is a favorite.  Diet options available too which I like. Everything comes out well presented, fresh and so tasty!!  I wish it was closer to where I lived- I'd go a lot more often!"}
{"text":"Since moving to CLT from the NY/NJ area I have been on the hunt for a good pastrami sandwich.  My wife and I tried this place based on the reviews.  Overall, the other reviewers were fair in terms of the ambience - it is a small, down home eatery anchoring a strip mall.  This was not a concern for us, but if you are looking for a gourmet deli with an upscale feel, this is probably not the place for you.  We purposely went late afternoon to avoid the lunch crowd.  The menu offers a pretty good selection of deli favorites at great prices.  To their credit, the service was outstanding as our waitress was very attentive and made our dining experience ejoyable.  We started with the chicken and rice soup, which was nothing to rave about.  I found it to be a little bland for my taste and the chicken was kind of mushy.  However, my wife seemed to enjoy it more than I did.  I had the pastrami on rye with a side of coleslaw.  The pastrami was lean and tasty and they were not stingy with the serving of meat.  The bread for my sandwich left a whole lot to be desired as it was soggy and stuck to the meat when I received it (I am guessing this was from the steam).  The slaw was decent.  My wife had the steak sandwhich with potato salad on the side, which she enjoyed.  Despite some of the execution issues with my dishes, I would consider trying it again based on the service and prices."}
{"text":"Awesome little deli run by attentive and friendly staff! Great cheese steak sandwich. Very good macaroni salad and you have to try the ranch dip that comes with the potato chips! Great prices and good portion sizes! Feels like a little piece of New Jersey in the middle of NC!"}
{"text":"The menu is very diverse and the staff is so nice... the service was also quick and the food is absolutely delicious. Definitely my favorite deli."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches for a great price. I had Chris' Special with cole slaw. The sandwich tasted fresh and the cole slaw was crispy. You can't ask for much more for $6."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Chris' is another Charlotte staple mostly frequented by locals. Chris himself still works in the kitchen during lunch. I'm willing to bet he's there all day.   It's an old fashioned menu, layout, and staff. Their subs and Greek salads are what keep me coming back. My only gripe is their selection of sides. I don't know how they've gotten away with that potato salad, macaroni salad, and cole slaw for all these years. None of them are very good.   Go after 1:00 to miss the rush. Get a sub and a cream soda. You'll be happy. Do not expect any frills."}
{"text":"This place is great! The wait staff is so nice and the food is excellent. Try the chicken and rice soup, the grilled chicken sub and the Chris' special which is roast beef and turkey on an onion roll. The sides are good as well. I like the macaroni salad the best. My friends love the Greek salad with chicken. Even with construction on Independence, the place gets packed at lunch, so I try to get there early to get a table."}
{"text":"Loved this little hole in the wall! Don't expect any frills.  Great place for soup, sandwiches and the potato salad was the bomb.  The only negative is trying to get here off Independence. I almost died courtesy of an El Camino trying to pull into the parking lot.  But I'll risk it all again for that hot ham sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been searching and searching for a local deli that could measure up to a NY style deli and I finally came across Chris'! It is located right off of Independence at the end of a small strip mall, but don't its location defer you from coming! It can be a little tough to locate for the first time but totally worth it once you do.   All the people were super friendly and it seemed like there were a lot of locals inside that absolutely love going here on a regular basis. Why, you may ask? Because the food is amazing! Now I cant speak to much of the food since I have only been once, but what I did have was delicious. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich on an onion roll with macaroni salad. The chicken salad was sooo good and fresh and it was a really nice sized portion for lunch. It also came with a nice scoop of macaroni salad (they have other sides if you prefer something else). I was stuffed after only eating half so I was even able to save my left overs for an easy dinner later that night!   The menu is pretty big and has so many things to offer, even catering for bigger events!!! Which we plan on using for our engagement party coming up :) I cant wait to go back soon and try some of the other delicious food that Chris' offers!"}
{"text":"Was working at a the Mercedes dealer down  the street and went here all 4 days for lunch.  Service was great, food was straight up deli sandwiches. My NY co-worker even loved it, so I know it was the real deal."}
{"text":"Legit. Clean bathroom and great service. I recommend the Reuben. Overall best Deli around."}
{"text":"This is only convenient for me if I remember to stop in on my way to work as you can only access from Independence heading into the Uptown area.  That being said, I had a really flavorful chicken noodle soup.  The only negatives were, only little flecks of chicken and tiny bits of vegetables.  It's not really a cream soup, but it's creamy.  I'm not sure how they achieve that, but it was loaded with noodles.  The BLT I had was well made with a good amount of bacon and perfectly toasted white bread.    I posted photos of both as I got take out.  I look forward to trying more items there."}
{"text":"Very good hot dog. Good chips and good salami and ham Sandwhich  Excellent chicken and rice soup my granddaughter didn't finish.  Boston cream pie very good and I don't eat dessert often.   Need fountain drinks as most sit down places have."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Chris' Deli  :-)  Their Thursday special of baked chicken with potatoes and carrots is simply delicious!  It's like your grandma used to make... really, it's super yummy!  It's so good in fact that they regularly run out, so you have to get there after 5pm but before 8pm or you'll miss out!    They also make the best greek salads, complete with super tasty, high quality feta cheese, tasty olives and spices with a very good house greek dressing.  If you're more of a chef salad fan, they do a mean chef salad as well!  The reuben is fantastic and like a reuben should be done on quality rye bread.  They offer a marinated chicken breast plate with a salad that just can't be beat if you're trying to eat healthy.  Of course they do all sorts of delicious deli sandwiches, made to order and served quickly.  My personal favorite side dish is their potato salad... it's really really good  :-) Oh yea- and they seem to have some sort of secret hookup with an amazing tomato guy- their tomatoes are delicious- they never go into the refrigerator either so they taste just like they came off the vine!   We moved away from the Independence area and we miss Chris' Deli.  We now try to plan our trips to that side of town to include a stop at Chris' for dinner  :-)"}
{"text":"I called them and spoke to Chris at 9:00 in the morning and needed lunch for 24 people by 11:00 and he exceeded my expectation by having everything ready along with insisting I take a bucket of ice for the drinks.  Said I could keep the bucket and go fishing.  Haha! I'll use them again for sure but will give a days notice next"}
{"text":"Wanted: soup. Why: because I can't handle this cold weather. I'm a wuss. Yes, I know I'm from Nebraska, but I think I've been in the South for too long now and lost my thick skin for chilly temps. Thanks to Yelp, I found this little old school deli and Charlotte gem tucked away in a strip mall on Independence.   The front of the menu has the tagline- you get your money's worth. That's all you need to know. End of review. I popped into Chris' at 8:30pm on a Monday. I was greeted warmly by one of the waitresses. Then it was decision time: vegetable, chicken noodle, or chicken and rice soup. I went chicken and rice. It was the perfect warm bowl of soup that I needed on a cold night. I also got a turkey reuben. So good. Note: they do their reubens with mustard. If you want thousand island, just make sure to ask. Soup, reuben, macaroni salad... all for about $10. I actually saved half my sandwich and side for lunch the next day. Two perfect Nikki-sized meals.   Chris himself was in the kitchen. He made my meal for me. He also took the time to come out, talk to me, and tell me about the place. (I walked in around closing time, so I was the only person there at the time) Such a sweet man. He even sent me home with a bag of apples. Why? Because he said they were so delicious.   I live in Elizabeth, so my GPS took me through a neighborhood on the backside of the strip mall. I didn't have to touch Independence at all. Just a heads up, in case you think your GPS is drunk.   Signs of a solid spot? The construction and bat ish craziness of Independence Blvd couldn't even slow down this place. It has a ton of regulars who pop in for lunch every week. You can add my name to that list."}
{"text":"There is something comforting about knowing when I'm just not feeling too good at work that I have this place right around the corner. They have an amazing chicken noodle soup its always served so hot in can drive 30 mins and it still burns my mouth. Decent sandwich selection but I have to recommend the soup. All my coworkers rave about the pastrami sandwiches well. Friendly owner and staff"}
{"text":"I like Chris's! In fact....I like it so much I convinced myself that the Micro-Garinger reunion scheduled for Thursday was today. Yay! That means I get a great sandwich TWICE this week!"}
{"text":"The best sub sandwich in Charlotte, in my opinion. I'm obsessed with the roast beef sub & potato salad! I'm a potato salad snob & this is the best I've ever had-bar none!!"}
{"text":"Ate there before going to a show today. Had the tuna salad on rye with macaroni salad on the side it was awesome. Wife had the roast beef sub she loved it. We're both fresh from New York  and with deli food like this I see no reason why I would want to go back north."}
{"text":"This is a place that is definitely hidden off of highway 74.  I have been past it MANY times and never saw it.  I went on a Friday night and it was not crowded, no wait.  I ordered a pastrami with a side of macaroni salad to go.  The pastrami sandwich I wanted hot.  The didn't toast the sandwich, which I'm used to and was surprised that they really only heated it up.  I like a nice toasty bread.  The sauerkraut was flavorful, so that was good.  The macaroni salad was absolutely awful.  I hate to be that blunt, but it had little to no flavor and the flavor it did have left and extremely bad after taste!  I was not a fan.  I may come back to try something different, because the staff was nice, but I will not be having the same thing for sure."}
{"text":"I was seeking a 'real' pastrami sandwich....not prefab, out of the package faux stuff. This appears to be a deli ,but my sandwich was disappointing. The people are  nice enough, the place clean. It is difficult to get to unless you're headed TO Uptown Charlotte. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"This is a little gem in a strip mall on independence. It is a little hard to get to unless you are traveling in the right direction, you can access the parking lot by driving around the block.   When you are in the mood for a sandwich, salad, or soup at an amazingly reasonable price head to Chris's. It is packed at lunch time but they are super fast for take out. They give a lot of side options with all their sandwiches and I totally recommend the potato salad. It was amazing.    It looks like they also sell meats by the pound. I took a picture of their current price list and posted. If you are in the area and looking for a quick and easy lunch check this place out!"}
{"text":"A deli, but not a New York style deli. Great sandwiches with a good variety of quality meats and cheeses - ham, turkey, roast beef and such. On sub rolls or a bread (including rye, white and whole wheat).  The sandwiches run between $5.50 and $7.00, so it's all pretty inexpensive. Sodas include canned Dr. Browns and they do have some wine and beer available.  We enjoyed what we ate, but I was hoping for bagels and smoked fish. Oh well.  Convenient location on East Independence if you're headed into the city. If you're heading out, you'll have to exit and go through a neighborhood, or continue onwards and make a u-turn."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and I must say I have always had a good experience. Now I often get my favorite, the BLT on white toast with a side of potato salad. I have had it so many times I even tried to recreate t at home myself, even down to the type of bread and the way the lettuce is shredded. Yes I shredded the lettuce by hand. It came out pretty good but this place has something secret going on.  I've also had the turkey sub (hot), pastrami no mustard (don't judge me), I even added pastrami to my turkey and that was the bomb. I have a lot of friends that love this place and for the most part they have nothing negative to say. I really don't either. It really is just a small simple place with simple food. It's just darn good.   It's also nice it is still thriving in an area that is currently struggling, with Independence construction and all. I will say they are in a pretty good little shopping center. Where else can you get great food, go next door and get your worship on, buy an e-cig a few more doors down, drop your kids off at day care, then zumba off that food. There s also a catering place too but that's another review.   This place is pretty much awesomeness. Oh and did I mention I am walking distance now. Yeah Im lucky."}
