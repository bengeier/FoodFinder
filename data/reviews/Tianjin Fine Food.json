{"text":"Amazing Pan Fried Dumplings! Juicy and lots of filling!"}
{"text":"Their beef pancake is so, SO delicious. It was a lot bigger than what I expected, and their complimentary congee is great. Try it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef noodle soup for $9. Was sadly disappointed.   The noodles were like instant noodles.  Very little beef. And the bowl was quite small. I was still hungry after.  Stick with their dumplings and pancakes!!"}
{"text":"The dumplings here are great. It's a small family run business. You keep expecting them to be friendly but they never are."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times over the years. Both their wontons and dumplings really never disappoint.  Only main issue is language, communicating what you want can be troublesome at times! Second thing, is that sometimes they take quite a while (ie. more than the usual 5-10 minute wait that other booths in the food court will have).  Otherwise, great dumplings for an amazing price.  Perfect for a little midday snack!"}
{"text":"The humble storefront of a fast food stall in FMP does not do Tia Njin justice.  I have bought dumplings for lunch a few times.  The dumplings are fresh and delicious.  They look more homestyle, or less glamourous, whatever terms you use.  What they lack in the look department, they make up in the taste department.  I bought the frozen dumplings for home once before ($15 for 45 or 50).  They tasted good, too.  However, they are almost as expensive as the frozen dumplings sold by Asian Legend ($10 for 30)."}
{"text":"Northern style dumpling shop located inside the First Markham Mall food court.  This is pretty much our go to location whenever we feel like having dumplings.  The secret in any dumplings in my opinion is the dough.  It must be just the right thickness and just the right chew.  The gluten in the dough really has to be worked in and they make it correctly here.   The dumplings are made by hand so it has that rustic chew and texture that I love, unlike machine made ones.  \"No chew, no good!\" is my motto for dumplings!  Get them either boiled or pan fried as they are both delicious.  They also make excellent Beef Wraps, Shanghai Dumplings, Fried Pork Buns, Leek Pancakes and other select Northern specialties.  Selection is limited but I prefer it that way as they can concentrate on what they are good at.  Ordering is a little difficult if you don't speak Mandarin but they understand Cantonese and limited English... worst case scenario just point to the pictures!  Do give yourself a little bit of time as it takes about 10-15mins for the food to come out as they make them fresh.    Overall great value for some great dumplings!"}
{"text":"The owner is very rude. I went their late around 8:30pm, they are about to close the business. I would like to have some buns. She said she only has cold ones, if I don't mind she heat the by microwave. I hesitated. I asked do you have pork bun. She said \" Pls go to other store.\" What's wrong with me and my question???  Typical northern China style service!"}
{"text":"Just like every family has their own versions of home made dumplings.. Tianjin Fine Food's dumplings versions might be a little different than the others places I been too...  Tianjin Fine Food is a small family ran fast food dumpling place inside First Markham Place Food Court. Everything is made to order here, you can watch how they busily making all the dumplings from scratch.  Leek and Pork Dumplings and Xiao Long Bao ($6.25 each) - Both of them has really heavy and doughy skin.. and a little chewy too - The fillings has a lot of seasonings... more on the salty side - a little more pricier than other places... but they are bigger in sizes... and are quite filling too!  So if you want a more homey dumplings... you should give Tianjin Fine Food's dumpling a try... but if you like those dumplings that has thinner skin, you would not enjoy them at all!"}
{"text":"I come to Toronto about 4 to 6 times a year and every trip I will go out of my way to come to this place just for their Xiao Long Bao's!!! By far the best I have had outside of china. Owners now me by now and that I come from out of town. Even their spice is to die for. Chive pie is amazing along with all the other dumplings. Thank god we don't have a place like this as I would be part of the furniture.  This place is truly a hole in the wall. It's in a mall. But everything is freshly done."}
