{"text":"I haven't been here for a while now since finding other better places in the neighbourhood.  Been here several times but last time was over a year ago so I can't speak for a more current experience but a friend of mine still goes occasionally and says not much has changed.

This is a Korean (family) owned Japanese restaurant which is different from the usual Chinese operated ones in the city.  The place is a bit small but ok for lunch and the patio is nice in the summer and more of a neighbourhood restaurant catering to the Church-Bloor St. crowds.  They offer a nice udon seafood noodle and their sashimi was good until one evening my order came with ice chips when they didn't defrost it properly.  Prices were on the higher side but not as high as Ichi Riki nearby but the quality is reasonable.  3 star rating for this place."}
{"text":"I've been here many times for team lunches or casual work events. Collectively we have ordered nearly everything on the menu. For the most part sashimi seems fresh and the portion sizes are good, but the rolls have WAY too much sauce. Everything feels like it has been drizzled triple time. I usually recommend half the sauce because it is completely doused in it. Service is decent though, they bring your food promptly and nicely lay everything out, but getting the bill can take a while (ironic). Not my first choice for restaurants."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi place! I had edamame, chicken yakitori, and a red dragon roll. I thoroughly enjoyed all of it. I was a little put off by the price tag of the red dragon, but once it arrives at your table you quickly realize it's completely reasonable. It's a very big roll that tastes awesome. Worth every penny. Also, we ate outside on the patio which was great. I highly recommend if you haven't been yet."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night. The place itself is sweet and price is fair. Food is just average. But service is so bad. Octopus takoyaki is more like takoyaki without octopus. When asked why there is bsically no octopus in the Takoyak balls, the waitress replied \"I don't know. We didn't make them. This is the way we serve them. \" then the chef/owner came to our table angrily and asked if there is anything wrong with an aggressive tone. When asked him the same question, the chef said \"we chose to buy this\". Then he said:\" what do you want? Do you want us to take it off the bill.\" So clearly, this restaurant chose to buy cheap material then serve them. And the way the waitress and the chef talked was like I never had any takoyaki before and I don't know what I am saying. During the entire time, they never  said sorry or expressed any sympathy. If u care about service, do not eat here.  Toasty not worth the money."}
{"text":"Having worked in this area for about 5 years of my life, I am no stranger to Asahi. I've been here for both lunch and dinner service, and it is a very different experience for both.

Being a popular spot for the businesses up at Bloor, lunch time is pretty packed. Go early, and make a reservation if you need a bigger table. They have a second floor, and a back patio (for the summer) which can accommodate lots of numbers. At night time, the restaurant is pretty quiet.

The menu is the same for both lunch and dinner, and it is reasonably priced given the area. The sushi itself is quite good, with consistently nice plating. Nothing ruins a dish more than sloppy visuals, y'know? I normally stick to the sushi sets (at the back of the menu), Spicy Sushi Set being my favourite! I find these sets are better value than ordering a la cart, or even the sushi boats. 

Last things to point out is that tea is $1, service is generally pretty slow, and they take American Express."}
{"text":"Small restaurant in an old house on Church street.  If you are lucky like me, you can park on street right in front.  Otherwise, there are a few parking lots within 2 blocks. 

Sushi and sashimi are good. Price is not too bad considering the location.  Service is okay but on on the relatively slow side."}
{"text":"hyfr damn good fresh ayce sushi! sashimi melts in your mouth, the rice is fresh, the surroundings are traditional, husband and wife team kept close and gave proper friendly service. i would omikase this chef anyday!"}
{"text":"Sushi was amazing. Great value as well. Fairly priced. The portion sizes were exactly what I was expecting. Best green dragon roll I've had recently. Delivery was on time."}
{"text":"Review of bento box only***

Worst bento box I've had in a long time.
Eat Japanese all over and I was pissed after trying this place.
Maybe next time I'll try something else on the menu if I ever go back"}
{"text":"I love Asashi Sushi!

The owners are super nice and friendly. They are efficient and when I went on the weekend, the restaurant was packed! Their sushi/sashimi is soo good and so fresh. I also learned that they make their own soy sauce which is a plus.

My favourite is their Hamachi maki rolls which has green onion on the outside. I had never seen this before any where else, and I really enjoyed it. I will definitely be back for more.

They also have some korean dishes which I enjoyed."}
{"text":"They charged for tea.

We would ask for more tea or water and they would fill one glass/cup and leave at a table of 6.  They made mistakes on orders.  Portions were tiny for the price even compared to nicer places.

I will not return.  The best thing is the server pretending to not understand English when we raised our concerns."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy chicken Benton. Not worth the price compared to other sushi places. 2 tiny pieces of tofu tempura and the chicken is mostly bean sprouts"}
{"text":"Have you ever ordered a Nabe udon and been given a dirty look for it? Have you ever received a Nabe udon with a side dish of yelling and lecture by the store owner? I have, at Asahi Sushi.

I went there a few weeks ago and had the worst dining experience of my life. I may be young but I've seen more than my fair share of restaurants and shit does not get worse than this. There were 3 warning signs that I should've trusted and walked out on:

1. The store was dark and empty at prime dinner time. The owner was sitting in the dark and I had to ask if they were open.

2. The owner was extremely odd and brought unimpressive menus and studied us, almost. Made me feel really uncomfortable.

3. When I finally decided on a menu item I thought I could tolerate and ordered (the Nabe udon), he scowled at us as if he was angry that I did not order sushi. Was he crazy? The place looked like it was out of business and had no windows looking out... as if I was going to trust raw fish to be fresh there?!

4. He brought out our food and I dove right into it, only to find chicken. I had ordered the Nabe because based on the description, it contained some seafood and vegetables. I was on a pretty strict pescetarian diet at this time. So, I suggested to the owner very nicely that perhaps he should list chicken as one of the main ingredients on the menu. I made it clear I was not complaining, but merely making a suggestion out of courtesy for the many strict vege/pescetarians who live in the neighbourhood.

He seemed to not understand this and proceeded to yell at me. He was yelling about what a nabe was, how it is supposed to be made with chicken, yada yada. I repeated that my comment had nothing to do with what a nabe was, and srsly who is he lecturing about authenticity?!

I was outraged that this man, whom I was paying money to serve me a meal, felt he was in any position to YELL at his customer. I asked him to please stop yelling and so we could begin our meal. I should've left at this point. He did not stop. He came back to continue yelling. His wife finally showed up at the store and tried to mediate with some water service, but really, how can you redeem what this crazy man had done? No one deserves to be yelled at like that."}
{"text":"I can see if this place might be a bit too busy lunchtime, considering the amount of office buildings in the vicinity. But go there for dinner and you will definitely not be disappointed! The service is great, (yet again, maybe not during lunchtime if they are swamped) though we have only had takeout so far. With the takeout you get cute little dipping-bowls for your soy, which actually is a big deal since I love mixing it up with the wasabi and am so tired of trying to pour the soy into the corner of the lid or something. Even when it comes in little containers they are usually too full to dip or mix in, so these little dipping-bowls really make my day! 
The sushi combos are between 9-14$, and the bento boxes (which I have not tried yet) between 8-10$. 

And most importantly,  I absolutely LOVE their sushi and maki! Nice atmosphere, good service, yummy maki...it's a winner!"}
{"text":"I am becoming disappointed in Asahi. The last few times have been, not the greatest experience. As i mentioned in my earlier review, this is the go-to sushi place for me and my co-workers, as it is seconds from the office. Really though, the service is terrible lately. Not to fault the servers, as they are rushing like mad.. there just are not at all enough servers on. Three servers for two floors is ridiculous. The average wait times for meals has skyrocketed. Today we waited over 35 min for our meals. The sushi came out before the salads and miso soup \"appetizers\" and they completely forgot my Sriracha even though I asked for it Twice.

My coworker ordered his sushi combo at the same time the rest of us did, and he never received it. 45 min later, our manager had to leave (after scarfing his meal rapidly in under 10 min) and sushi-less coworker was left waiting for his meal. When he flagged down the waiter, they had forgotten to enter it into the computer. Our manager paid for the entire team's bill, but our one coworker whose sushi was MIA was presented his own bill on the side. He complained, obviously, as it was not his fault that they had forgotten to put it on the company bill and asked if he could get any sort of discount. They refused. 

My $7 Hamachi sashimi was not the highest quality today and tasted very \"frozen\". Additional minus points for disposable chopsticks. 

Disappointed, as we have been there so many times.. but it really is getting considerably worse. New sushi suggestions for Y&B welcome!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as I
Live around the corner but tonight will be my last time. The staff was rude and pushy. Not a smile or unhurried word anywhere. Once I got home I found I had cold chicken.  Keep in mind I live across the street. The rice was hot, and terribly over cooked. 

My dynamite roll is soggy and flavourless with about 3 tablespoons of roe covering everything. The salad and miso soup are standard. This meal cost me 25 dollars and at most places would have been much less considering portion sizes and quality. 

Have had one positive experience a few neutral and a few negative. The restaurant was empty when I went and I was made to wait 20 minutes. The least I could have had was hot food. Absolutely disappointed."}
{"text":"This isn't my first time and certainly won't be the last, as it's a greatly convenient neighbourhood spot. The service is excellent and the food is always good. I recommend the red green dragon and the dynamite roll if you like something with a bit more heat. For the maki purist the maki trio A is always a safe bet. Decent tempura too!"}
{"text":"The dragon roll topped with salmon is the best that I've found in this area. It used to be $8.95 in late 2010, which is a standard price, but they bumped it up to $11.95 in early 2011. $12 for a dragon roll is a lot in my opinion, but I'll still get it occasionally because it's so good.

The spicy tuna roll is very good too, and the tempura always comes out just right."}
{"text":"I've been going to Asahi for more than 5 years now, and still love this place.  I've been to many of the city's AYCE sushi restaurants, and feel Asahi is a real hidden gem. 

It's a small restaurant (seating for 25 max), and won't win any interior decorating awards, but the sushi and sashimi is reliably excellent, and the \"chef's suggestions\" (beef, chicken and salmon teriyaki, tempura, yakiniku, etc) are great meaty mains to fill you up.  Even the standard green tea ice cream offered at most of these types of joints somehow tastes better here.  Favourites for me include the calamari(nice light batter) and yakitori (the sauce is excellent), the butterfish sashimi, the unagi nigiri (usually served a little warm), and sunset and asahi roll.  They also offer don buri and udon soups, but I usually steer clear to focus on the sushi.

The place is run by a duo who are real characters.  She is the server/hostess and he's the sushi chef....she's friendly and attentive, he's occasionally grumbling in japanese, but it's all part of the charm of the place.  It really feels like \"home\" - they always remember me even on the rare occassion it's been 6 months since my last visit, and you know they really take pride in their food.   This is *not* the kind of AYCE place you go and order plateful after plateful of salmon sashimi, but nor is it the kind of AYCE place with a 1hr time limit on your table!   For $20.95 per adult for dinner it's a real steal and worth a generous tip on top. HIghly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a good sushi spot in the neighborhood, but it's just not one of my favorites.

The service is okay.  They accidentally seated us at a reserved table and they had to move us to the outside patio in the back.  The seating here is limited, it's a small place.  The patio is nice.  But sushi in the hot sun in not usually something I fancy.

They have Korean items as well if there are people in your group that don't eat sushi.  The lunch specials are cheap (starting at $6.95) and there is a lot of variety.

The miso soup was tasteless.
We split a medium sized sushi boat which was 45 pieces.
The rolls are small but the sushi is fresh.
The boat was a mix of sashimi, maki, and sushi.
I didn't think there was enough sashimi.

My experience here wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything to remember.  
For the same price there is an AYCE down the street with comparable quality and a larger bustling dining space."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time for lunch on Tuesday. Was seated and then forgotten about. Not conducive for a timed lunch. Fail."}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant has very friendly staff, and ample seating space, especially on the upper level. I've tried their bento box and some of their specialty maki rolls, and I would say that they were average, and the bento box was below average for a downtown Japanese place. The meals are priced right, although they don't quite follow through with the quality of food. Overall, I would drop by if you are in the vicinity, but I wouldn't make it a trip in and out of itself."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with 6 others on a Friday afternoon around 12:30. The place was pretty busy and we sat outisde in the back, which was pretty nice. 

I ordered the Spicy Sushi set which wasn't bad for $10.95 (came with 12 pieces and a hand roll). My co-workers ordered simliar items. 

i gave it 3 stars because the service was pretty slow - as in, it took us an hour to get our food (otherwise, it would've been a 4). The waiter came by to inform us that they were really busy (as evident by the packed outdoor area where we were sitting). But by the time our food came, about 75% of the tables surrounding us had left. 

I would give it another chance as I was satisfied with my meal. However, there are so many sushi options around the Yonge/Bloor area that I wouldn't go out of my way to eat @ Asahi."}
{"text":"I like weird rolls and I cannot lie!

The stakes are so high when trying a new sushi place.  My colleague and I were walking to Lola's, both feeling like sushi but heading to Lola's, when we were reassured by the full patio and dining room.  We got a seat upstairs and ordered a couple of giant 10-12 piece rolls as well as a sashimi starter.  

I saw that they had a bulgogi and kimchi roll, and I had to do it.  I'm just so crazy about weirdo rolls.  This one did not disappoint.  We also had the asahi tuna roll, which was a dynamite roll with spicy crunchy tuna on top.  Two rolls plus the sashimi starter, which was totally okay, made for a great lunch for two ladies.  Big ups!  Bring on the weird rolls!"}
{"text":"I would say by far the best sushi I ate in Toronto yet. I tried a lot of different things and now, i can't even get tired of their spicy and crunchy selection.

Service is not the best. I sat on the patio more than once and even though my server would go to the tables around me. He never bothered to bring me a menu or to say greet me. I had to get inside and get my own menu and stop him after his 4th visit to tell him what I wanted. Then, after waiting a long time for my bill, I decided to go inside to see them all talking together (I was the only costumer left.) 

This is one experience though. 

Will go back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and loved the sushi here!  They use pretty ordinary fish for their rolls (tuna, salmon, eel, etc.), but they add a creative twist to it.  One of my favorites is their Ninja roll.  I believe it had eel, salmon, avocado, a minty leaf flavor, and a soy wrap.  Good portion size too with 8 pieces per roll at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My gf and I walk by this place all the time and decided to finally give it a try.  The servers were a little slow and it took a little while to get a table at first.  We were finally seated upstairs and given our menus about 15 minutes into getting to the restaurant. 

We ordered a sashimi combo and I got the assorted sushi combo.  The sashimi was pretty fresh and they gave us nice cuts of fish.  I did notice my salad had a large piece of plastic in it, which the server quickly replaced after I mentioned it.  My food was decent and for the price and location I suppose it was ok.

I can't say I would come back anytime soon, but I wouldn't mind giving this place another try if I am craving some sushi on the go."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend when they first opened and I was not impressed with the quality. I found the found the fish to be old. It didn't taste too fresh. 

On a positive note, the ambiance is really nice."}
{"text":"A nice little restaurant on the southweset corner of Bloor and Church street. The facade is narrow and the entrance may not be obvious unless you are purposely looking for this restaurant. It has a nice patio at the back and the inside lighting is very dim.

I ordered a unagi don which comes with salad and miso soup. The unagi was soft and the food is quite average. However, the portion was very small. When the unagi don comes on a container, the container looks big. Unfortunately, the food is only filled up half of the container because the inside is elevated."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly to the regulars, giving them priority seating and service.  it was my first time there, people lining up behind me got seated first, table that sat down after I did got served first.  I guess I won't be one of those people joining the frequent customer club.

Trying to order was a challenge, since I wasn't a regular.  The food was ok, nothing I can't get at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Solid Korean sushi, used to be cheaper w previous owners, staff used to be more personable and accommodating but good sushi is good sushi. I just miss the family feel it had to it."}
{"text":"My partner is allergic to shellfish. This makes certain cuisines, such as sushi, difficult, but impossible. We both enjoy sushi, and on this particular evening, we were both quite hungry. Unfortunately, upon entering and asking if this venue did AYCE, we were very rudely and emphatically told \"NO!\" Okay; it was just a question. When we decided to still eat here, because we were THAT hungry, we were shuffled upstairs.

I will say that it's nicely decorated. It was obviously intended for date nights. But then you open the menu. And it's so completely uninspiring. There's barely any rolls (beyond the regular ones) that don't have shrimp in them. Eventually I decided, maybe I'd get a roll combo and see if any substitutions could be made. Now, it does say on the menu that they don't do subs, but honestly, there was no reason to be rude in replying to my very simple question.

So, I found no combos appealing, or even possible because of the shrimp content, leading me to getting the Spicy Salmon (6 pieces) and the Crunchy Avocado (6 pieces). My partner got the Chicken Tereyaki Dinner which comes with Miso Soup, Salad and Rice.

The sushi was awkwardly large, with too much rice. The Crunchy Avocado roll was not tasty. The Spicy Salmon roll was meh. My partner found the dressing of the salad to be bitter, and the chicken to be mediocre.

I've already mentioned that I wasn't impressed with the service. But the last straw for me is that the servers would come around and top off my partner's glass (who had a full glass of water) and then just walk away when MY glass was practically empty. It just seems like they took an instant dislike to me because I had asked simple questions. I was totally okay with them not being AYCE and not being able to do subs. I DID give them my money for their food. But the whole experience was lackluster at best, and offensive at most. They seem to have a chip on their shoulder, and with meh food, I can't see them losing that chip any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times over a period of 3 years - only when the weather has been cold enough to put me off from venturing any further. To put it simply, this place is overpriced and has a lackluster menu offering compared to several other spots in the area! The service is also very poor as some of the others have noted below."}
{"text":"I have decided to update this review and change my rating from 4 to 5 stars. Why? Because since my last review the service has become incredibly friendly and hasn't been slow in ages (my past review was written May 27, 2012, so a year later deserves an update). Also, in the past year I haven't tried a bento-box so I no longer feel up to the task of evaluating them; nevertheless, the sushi remains excellent, of high quality, and is provided in generous portion sizes.  I reiterate, \"this place has the best sushi in the area\" and is definitely worth visiting if in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Overpriced and service was not good. They didn't even smile. The salmon and chicken teriyaki had No teriyaki sauce and was doused with too much oil. It was overcooked too."}
{"text":"Small and cozy, quick service and good selection of rolls."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant out. Looks very cute from outside. The place is just really average in every way. Sushi was fine, but not great. Service was slow and sloppy. Even had to ask for soy sauce, plates and a drink menu. There was just one server for the whole place and he did his bare minimum to get the food under your nose and collect payment. There's simply too many great sushi restaurants near by to come back here, which is a shame as it's really close to me."}
{"text":"Super cute patio, fast and friendly service, and really good prices.

Four of us stopped in here, after a sunny, hot afternoon of walking around Church and soaking in all that Pride has to offer.  

They had a lunch special on, 2 rolls, and a pint of Saporo for $12.95.  It was well after 5pm when we stopped in and we asked for the lunch special, to our surprise and utter joy, they said they could give us the lunch special.  Yay!

The sushi was good, presentation pretty, and the beer was cold.  

Good spot.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Mmm... korean comfort food and fresh sushi. Asahi has both and they're so good! 

Take out. Check.
Fresh, hot, sesame drizzled bibimbop with a side of chili paste. Check.
Fresh, generously sized maki roll on the side. Check. 
Miso soup included. Check.
Gratuitous lettuce pieces (aka included side salad). Check.
Under $20. Check.
Lunch-rush but still a quick turnaround. Check.

Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Came for dinner and the food was mediocre, service wasn't great. 
I've had take out from here for lunch and it's okay since I'm in the area. But there is so much competition in the area that service definitely makes a difference.
Also, the server watched us pay with the machine, so awkward!"}
{"text":"Meh
Went here for lunch yesterday as a friend recommended it. 4 of us arrived at around 12:45pm and the place was quiet. We were seated right away and off the staff member went. He came back about 5 minutes later to get our drink order and when he returned he took our food order. We never saw him again until our food came out. We had to ask for refills of our water..and we really weren't checked on by the waiter.
I can't comment on the others food, so this is strictly based on my order.
I ordered the spicy chicken bento box. It came with Miso soup and salad, and the box contained steamed sticky rice, broccoli (2 pieces), potato croquettes and the chicken. The chicken is aptly named..it had quite a bit of heat. Portion size was small, but with the other items thrown in, it was ok. Rice is rice...it was fine. Broccoli was steamed and had zero flavour....so I tossed it in with the spicy chicken. The potato croquettes were \"interesting\"....pretty bland and really unmemorable. I don't like miso, so I passed it to someone who does...and she said it was ok...but she didn't finish it. The salad was ok.
To start, we shared a bowl of edamame...it was warm and salty.
So.....the food was just ok. The hi-light was the spicy chicken...everything else was unmemorable.
Would I go back...most likely not, as there are other places to try."}
{"text":"Alas the shitty service was finally fixed ! They hired a waitress who actually takes your order and brings it on time and WATER, they actually brought out water for us this time! Food is still great here, only issue was with the service which has taken a 180 in the positive direction"}
{"text":"I went to Asahi for the first time and they have now become my go-to spot for fresh, delicious sushi in the Church/Wellesley area. The rolls were to die for and were beautifully presented. Very impressed. Highly recommend them. They have a nice little patio out front too!"}
{"text":"I went there in a cold rainy day, and was quickly served green tea and miso soup. 

I don't know why people try to create over trational stuff. I was eager to have my hot miso and it was full of shitake - and I'm allergic to mushrooms. 

My order was a tofu bento. Very well served, fresh salad, and the waiter brought it super fast. I am just complaining about WTF SHITAKE ON THE MISO. 

The price is ok. You can find other japanese restaurants offering similar bento-lunches for more reasonable prices, but ok, you have to consider the location, etc. 

I'd come back if they would offer shitake-free miso. Specially in a cold afternoon."}
{"text":"This place deserves more credit than it gets. Asahi Sushi has ample seating, with 2 floors of seating to choose from and an outdoor patio in the summer. It seems like a great place to host an event, birthday party or staff luncheon. 

As soon as you enter, you're greeted with a warm and friendly welcome. The server and staff here have a great sense of humour too, always a bonus. 

I came here for dinner with a decent appetite and since it was my first time here, I decided to \"go big or go home\" by ordering the Asahi Boat. Highly recommend it as it's a great way to sample a variety of different Sushi options, it's also delicious and very photogenic too. 

The small Asahi Boat comes with 30 melt in your mouth pieces of Sushi, Sashimi and Maki with ample wasabi and pickled ginger. You even get to select your favourite choice of Maki. Impressive!

Itadakimasu!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night because it was nearby. The place was nice for dates but since my bf and I just wanted to grab a bite, the food mattered more. 

I got the spider roll, which was $12.95 for 10 pieces. It was decent (with consideration that I was very hungry it was probably a little less tasty than decent) nothing special. My bf got the chicken teriyaki bento ($10.95) with miso soup and salad -as expect of any jap food place,  a small portion of chicken, normal portion of rice, 2 gyoza, some strings of radish and ONE small slice of orange. 

Overall, it was disappointing because the place was cute being seated upstairs. But the food just had small portions and average taste... 
My thought would be to change the radish to 2 pieces of California roll or something so the bento wouldn't look so depressingly empty. 

Wouldn't come here again because I think there are so many other sushi places with cheaper price that make the same level of food."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the sign outside of this restaurant has lower prices than the menu inside for a few items. I came here for lunch with a friend on a weekday. The restaurant has outdoor seating and two floors that have seating. We got a seat on the 2nd floor that was tucked into a corner. It was nice since it was a little quieter and less busy than the other areas. I ordered the 10 piece sushi set that comes with 4 pieces of sushi and 6 pieces of california roll. The sushi assortment was 2 salmon, 1 tuna and a white fish. The california roll had avocado, cucumber, crabmeat. The sushi was all fresh and tasted decent. The entire meal was a little light so I still had room for more. Portions are small, so maybe order an app to split."}
{"text":"Went here the other day with a co-worker for lunch.

Strangely enough I didn't end up getting the sushi here and ended up going Korean with their Bibimbap. Fantastic, so was their Miso soup that came with my meal.

The only problem I had here was the steamed dumplings which came out a bit watery and diluted the flavor of the dish.

A-OK by my standards, another great Asian restaurant to check out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"A great little place right on the corner of Ontario and Carlton.  The service is amazing and food well prepared and priced.  Go there once and they remember you.  Talk to them and you won't be forgotten.

Been there twice and really enjoyed it.

I like on their menu:

Combination 1 The Maki is amaaazing"}
{"text":"Food is average, poor service though. 
Seems like most sales are made on take-out orders."}
{"text":"Asahi is an authentic little dining room with a large Japanese/Korean fusion menu that's great for date night. The banquets are intimate and placed cozily close together. The decor is simple and elegant. The service is friendly and efficient.

The food comes beautifully plated and in gigantic portions. My chirashi ($12.95) arrived with a pleasing assortment of fish in what looked more like a serving platter than a plate. My dinner date's red dragon roll came in more colourful pieces than I could count on all my little fingers. The salad was dressed in a most appetizing ginger dressing and the miso soup featured sliced mushrooms.

Don't forget to grab one of Asahi's handy To Go menus (with 14 choices starting at $5.95 + even cheaper veggie options) on your way out. Happy Hour, featuring food and drink specials every day from 3-6pm, is definitely a good reason to visit as well."}
{"text":"You know how everyone is like \"omg i know the best sushi place.\"  And then you go there and it sucks?  Well this isn't the case here.  I go all over the place for sushi, downtown, scarborough, markham... Asahi is the best tasting sushi period.

The rolls are big, but not too big.  If you're eating in, it's quaint and the staff are nice.  Very nice patios (there are two).

Not the cheapest I've ever had, but it's amazing."}
{"text":"I work in the area and this is definitely the go to spot if you are craving some good quality sushi. The staff understand that lunch time sit downs need to be quick so you can ensure you can get back to work for your 1pm meeting. Other than the great service, the sushi quality is way above average for Toronto standards. You definitely pay a premium but it's worth it vs. AYCE. 

I will be back next time I have some time for a longer lunch ;)"}
{"text":"Decent portions, decent sushi, decent service. Nothing to rant or rave about. Ordered the sashimi combo, and noted that the fish was fresh and sizable.

I've also tried getting takeout from here, and they had a quick turnaround - 20 minutes? The problem was that when I got there, they had no one there for me to get the food from, for about 10 minutes! Ok, correction...the FOOD was sitting right there, packed away in a take out container, but no one in sight! Had I been a more dishonest person, I could have whisked that order out of there, out of sight, out of mind!

They've have my vote in convenience and speed, but the food itself...meh! If ever a sushi craving comes along, this place is satisfactory indeed. But only just!"}
{"text":"Mediocre and overpriced. No lunch specials, got the bulgogi bento box and the beef tasted old/off. They charge for green tea as well. Nothing special"}
{"text":"Asahi Sushi sucked me in because the sign on the window promised LUNCH SPECIALS from $6.95. 

This restaurant just made me feel depressed. The decor is so outdated and in bad need of renovations. Everything feel a little sticky, a little dirty. The whole time I was there, I was the only 2 tables that occupied the whole empty restaurant.... 

Lunch Special B ($7.95) comes with salad/soup, 4 Salmon Sushi and 6 pc of Crispy Salmon Roll. The fish itself was quite good.. the only thing I can comment on is the crispy salmon roll a little too heavy on the tempura bits. 

I don't think I will be back again...."}
{"text":"Overall very impressed with this Sushi place that is just around the corner from my condo. There are already a few options within 3 blocks including Nijo Sushi, Wow Sushi and Tokyo Kitchen as well as some cheap alternatives on Yonge Street. 

I hadn't come to Asahi Sushi because I always tend to go to Nijo Sushi. Now for some reason Nijo sushi is closed due to \"Management Change & Renovations\" so decided to try this place on Church Street. 

First off, they have an outdoor patio in the front and in the back which is great for the summer when you want to get some sunshine. More importantly, the sashimi platter had a great mix of fish and everything was very fresh. Freshness is always the key to a good experience and I suspect that Asahi Sushi is busy during the weekday with many office towers around and not a lot of restaurant options. 

The service was fairly good although there weren't too many people in there when we arrived (around 3pm on a weekday). Would definitely recommend this place as a Sushi alternative in the area. I give it a 5 as it is what it is meant to be - a good local sushi place. (That doesn't mean you should travel from Oshawa or Hamilton to check this place out though!!!)"}
{"text":"I walked into the restaurant and noticed young hipsters everywhere so much disappointment was expected. I ended up being apathetic towards the place. The salad is terrible and the miso soup standard fare. The spicy sushi set I ordered was alright. It wasn't very spicy but the portions were large enough and it was well presented.and well made. The taste wasn't bad, but it just wasn't as present as I like it to be. Service seemed decently quick and the server was very friendly. One word of caution: if you don't want to be able to touch a stranger just by stretching your arms, do NOT opt for the patio."}
{"text":"The sushi craving hits about once a week, and it was an unseasonably warm night in March when birdsong, twitter-pating and eating outdoors were just beginning.  I checked Yelp for a good place we could walk to and found Asahi just 6 minutes from home.  With a vacant table outside!  Prices and menu were similar to the Bloor corridor sushi joints, but the difference was in the details.  Extraordinarily tasty miso with enoki mushrooms.  Bright green, plump edamame, lovely green tea.  The smaller of the sashimi plates ($11.95) was almost too much for me to finish, with fish as fresh as you could want, artfully arranged on shredded daikon and a lettuce I didn't recognize, lemon slices, and a sprig of fresh thyme.  My companion had a seafood sizzling plate (also $11.95) overloaded with mussels, shrimp, conch, and squid in a teriyaki sauce served with rice.  The waitress was charming and when the manager came outside we told him that he had some pretty good reviews on Yelp.  He said at first people said the portion size was small, so they responded by making them bigger.  He seemed like he genuinely cared about pleasing his clientele.  For their obvious effort to do well what so many of their ilk just do average, I give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I used to love this place...last year...when it was under different ownership. Since the change the quality and service has significantly gone down. 

I ordered take out for myself and 3 coworkers. They told me due to the lunch rush it would take 40 minutes. I went at that time and to my surprise they said they had given my order to someone else. I understand that mistakes happen so I waited patiently for them to make my order again. It took them 50 minutes to remake my order and all they said was sorry and gave me a 15% off my next order coupon. 

When I went today I asked if they would change 1 roll in a combo since I am pregnant and can't eat raw fish (salmon roll to a unagi roll). They said no and made me order each roll separately...which is the same amount of effort but more expensive. 

Will not be returning here. Hopefully they change ownership again soon!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my sister after work. It was just after 6pm so the place was starting to pick up. It's a long cozy restaurant with a long banquet along one side with little wooden tables.

We were greeted with a warm welcome and allowed to sit wherever we chose. We went to a larger table towards the back along the banquet. Our waitress graciously brought over the menus and asked to take our drink orders.

As usually we ordered two Green Teas. It come over piping hot and served in cute decorative cups. This is the true green tea that I love! They kept the refills coming, I never had to ask once and it only cost 50 cents!

Next we ordered a bunch of things to try.

From the Spicy Crunchy Rolls we orders the Spicy Salmon Roll -
We got six hefty sized rolls, fresh tasting, good hint of spice with a subtle crunch to it which I really enjoyed.

Tempura Vegetables - 6 hot and crispy coated vegetables. It consisted of  2 big pieces of sweet potato, broccoli, eggplant, red peper, and acorn squash.

Next we ordered two Bento Boxes - They bento boxes came with a simple salad with a citrus flavoured dressing, a sweet potato noodle salad, diced potato medly, steamed white rice, and orange slice + the choice of meat you select. I believe this was suppose to come with a miso soup but I guess they forgot it.

The meats for the Bento Boxed we chose were:

Chicken Teriyaki - It was pretty dry, I think they over cooked the chicken and it was floating in to much sauce which didn't compensate

Bulgogi Beef - A spicy stirfried beef was tender and flavourful.

Overall service that night was pretty good. The only thing I didn't like was they brought out all the food way too fast, we were still working on the rolls when they brought out the tempura and bento boxes. But I have to give it up to them for turning out food soo fast! I would probably avoid the Bento boxes next time and keep a menu handy to order as I go because the wait time for food is not the long at all!

FYI Bathroom are located downstairs.....had such a disgusting repulsive mildewy smell....they were clean....but the smell was intense."}
