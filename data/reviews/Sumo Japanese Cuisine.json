{"text":"* Came here on a Monday night! Was quiet but there were about 3-4 tables. Expected though since many likely go for AYCE on weekends (?).    *While it's order-by-iPad, whenever we had special requests such as no salt on edamame or to swap the cold for hot tea, the waitresses were super kind and willing. When we weren't sure if an item was on the menu, a waitress overheard and kindly pointed it out to us.   *For the most part, it was like most other AYCE. The variety is not bad for a small shop. They even have torched sushi (salmon, white tuna, saba, red tuna). One thing I've never had elsewhere would be the spicy miso soup - nice to start off with something warm and hot! Their desserts include GT, red bean, mango, and vanilla ice-cream, chocolate/strawberry mousse, coconut milk pudding, and mango pudding.   *Food came quickly too and no orders were missed :)   Overall - while the quality can never be compared to sushi in Japan, Sumo is alright for Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I've been to Sumo twice now. The first time was back last Dec for lunch on a Sat for a friend's B-day. I remembered the food and service being pretty decent back than. Other than the fact that they didn't have a lunch AYCE menu, so they charged us $26.95 for lunch, so we vowed never to return for lunch. And that soft drinks were not included, and their dessert selections being pretty unimpressive. I had no other complaints about the place. They would have received a 3-3.5 star from me back than.     So 2 Saturdays ago, when we were trying to think of an AYCE sushi restaurant to go for dinner, this place popped into our minds. I called about an hour beforehand to make a reservation. When they picked up, the person on the phone sounded surprised I was calling for a reservation and told me they were not too busy right now, so it should be fine. Not too busy on a Sat night dinner around 7pm? That should have been our 1st sign to choose another location. We were not wise enough and the 4 of us went anyways. When we got there, it was indeed not very busy. Probably less than half the restaurant was full, and most of the other tables had ordered Bento Boxes instead of AYCE. That should have been our 2nd sign to maybe leave. But we were not wise enough and proceeded to order from the AYCE menu anyways.  Now some notes about the food: ~Sashimi were not that fresh. Salmon sashimi was ok, but some of the other fishes were really fishy tasting. You could order fish roe as a sashimi without rice, but it was this weird dark copper red colour I had never seen fish roe as before. ~The sushi rice they used for the sushi, maki, and hand rolls were bland and lacked the proper seasoning. It made me not want to order anything else with rice after the first round.  ~They had 6 kinds of torched sushi available, which interested us, but they all tasted the same because the fish was not fresh. They also all had the same sauce on them, except for the torched shrimp and the torched mackeral. Also the same bland rice. So even though they gave us a few pieces less than what we ordered, so not everyone could try all 6. We did not care to even order it again. ~Tempura items were ok according to my friends, I did not try. ~Grilled items were ok as well. Although some of the meats were overcooked. And the diced steak and garlic was swimming in oily grease. ~Udon soup noodles were ok. We ordered the 2 of the same Seafood Udon, and the seafood were probably random pieces of fish leftover from the sushi bar. And the portion of the 2 bowls served at the same time were different from each other. The other 2 ordered the Pork Cutlet Udon, and they placed the cutlets right into the soup. ~Desserts were unimpressive. Besides ice cream, they had 2 kinds of mousse, a coconut pudding of some sort, and mango tapioca. Just stick with the ice cream. The mousse were powdery. We ordered the coconut one, but it didn't come. And the mango tapioca was ok, but had some tapioca in it that were under cooked.   ~Some of the items that we thought were interesting and enjoyed the first time we went, such as the grilled rice cake with cheese, were now gone.     We had never encountered a situation before where we were at an AYCE place, we were not full yet, but was struggling to find anything to order because none of the food interested us. Service was ok though. We asked them to refill our pots of water and tea a few times, and they did it right away. They missed a few items in our order though. And the sushi didn't come in the correct number of pieces.  You get 10% off if you pay in cash. Dinner is $26.95 on the weekend. Price was not worth the food. We will probably not be coming back."}
{"text":"First time here since the renovations and change in owner. We went for ayce lunch on a weekend with 6 of us.  I will be rating this place according to food, atmosphere, and service.  Service 4.5/5 - service was extrememly nice and fast. Our server was very relatable to us and created conversation. I would give server a 5 because she was amazing. I am taking a .5 star off because of the iPad missed a lot of our order. It is great that they are using the iPad but they would really need to fix the missed orders part.  Atmosphere 5/5 - This place looks way better than it use to and the ambience of the place was very relaxing, but i can see it being quite noisy with groups and stuff. We went at a time where there was only 4 other groups. This restraunt is great for groups or just two people.  Food 4/5 - let's start with the bad so we end with the good. There is a ayce menu and also a regular menu.   Bad: in my opinion do not get the rice cake with either the cheese sauce or the other sauce. It tasted like dog food! ( yes I know what dog kibbles taste like because I have tried it haha). Because we went on the weekend there was sashimi scallop, sweet shrimp and octopus. I did not really enjoy the scallops because they were super small and tasted a little fishy to me. One more thing in my opinion there was a little too much rice for the sushi.  Good: Well one thing that is absolutely making me crave this restraunt is their shrimp tempura!!! The shrimp was not huge but not too small at the same time. The shrimp tempura was freshly made. It was crisy golden brown and the coating of batter on the shrimp was just perfect. Another thing that was amazing was the spider roll!! I normally don't order the spider rolls because a lot of places don't make it right, but this spider roll you can fit the whole bite in your mouth!!! What else that was very memorable to me was the beef short ribs. I usually don't like beef short ribs outside because in my opinion I make the best short ribs , but this place was almost on par with mine. Sashimi majority was pretty good. Oh oh and they have torched sushi as well. The salmon and white tuna was the best. One last thing that i have to comment on is the green tea. Sometimes people don't pay attention ti the tea, but their tea tasted really good. It had roasted brown rice in the tea.  In general this was a pretty good place. Nice place for a group. Pretty awesome food. I will definitely be returning. Price was about 30 per person."}
{"text":"This is our second time going to Sumo.  While during our first visit, we were amused by the waitress asking us, 'do  you REALLY want 12 pieces of torched sushi (for four of us, when we had just started eating), the second visit was less than amusing.  These are the reasons why we will not return to Sumo:  -We came during a busy holiday weekend to the restaurant, half of the time we sat waiting for food.  We took this in stride, until one of the waitress informed us there's a time limit in this restaurant. We reminded the waitress that we had spent considerable time waiting for the food and she simply ignored it.  No one had informed us when we booked for a reservation nor when we were seated. If we were aware of the time limit, we would not have been so patient with their slow service.   -The food is average.  We were looking forward to the desert.  I remember the mousse and coconut puddings during our first visit to be good, only to be told 'ran out of mousse and puddings'.  So only ice cream was available.  Again, granted it seemed a busier time than our first visit to the restaurant, but the restaurant ran out of most of the desert by 8:45??  -So this is an AYCE: for a limited seating time (which no one bothers to inform you of until you have reached the time limit) and will only be all you can eat for the items 'that still available'.    -sorry we came the second time."}
{"text":"I called to give in my order for a take away.... and I specifically told them no to put fish eggs. The lady was super rude on the phone, she kept cutting me and it seemed like she had better things to do at that moment, she barely paid attention to what I was saying and guess what? They did put fish eggs in our spicy salmon rolls! For someone with dietary restrictions, I can tell you that pissed me off a lot. Also, we asked for spicy mayo on the side and they gave us this small tin like is this a joke? And finally, for soya sauce, we asked for extras and they give you these small packets - totally not worth it. I don't recommend this place. There are better sushi place in the area."}
{"text":"Sumo just opened a few days ago, right now they are having special opening promo for 15% off, you can pay by cash, debit or credit with this discount which is great.  We were here last night to try out the AYCE experience.  Setting: Nice, clean, specious.  Services: All servers were really nice and polite, hope they will keep up the good work, as they are newly opened and only a few diners were in the restaurant.  Ipad order system, however is a bit buggy, few items that we tried to order were given options as price rather than quantity, so the waitress have to take the order of how many pcs you want instead.  Also, few dishes that we ordered didn't come out, such as: salmon tartar, grilled squid, etc...thats the one thing I hate the most, but given that they are newly opened, I let them slide this time without complaining, since they provided really friendly services.   Food: avocado salad, seaweed salad, crabmeat salad: ok, average seafood soup, spicy miso soup, crabmeat soup: ok, something different fm other AYCE sweet shrimp sashimi: great, but a bit small saba, salmon, tamago, red snapper, white tuna sashimi: average tuna, salmon, torched sushi: average, torched sushi weren't that torched, missing the torch flavor. spicy scallop sushi: great & yummy philadelphia roll- average eggplant, mushroom, shrimp tempura: great, they came out pipping hot, thinly battered the way it should be. baked mussels: great, hot & yummy with bacon bits n mayo chicken with cheese skewer: hot & yummy pork skewer: ok chicken gizzard skewer: yummy great salmon belly: great, fatty salmon chicken wings: great, hot hot hot beef ribs: average but hot Haven't try any rice or noodle dishes, but they all look like some other AYCE would offer.  Dessert: green tea, red bean, vanilla ice cream strawberry mousse, mango sago  for the dessert part, not alot of choices.  Also, have to pay for drinks separately.  Extra: got a little kitty good luck charm as a gift at the end of the meal.  Price: think the waitress told me it was $24.99 for weekday dinner, and $25.99 or $26.99 for weekend dinner.   All in all, I would go back again later, hope they will fixed their Ipad system by then."}
{"text":"Sumo is my go to sushi spot. I am by no means a sushi connoisseur, but to me Sumo is a solid AYCE option that may not be as high end as other sushi spots in Markham (Matsuda), it's worth the price ($25 if paying with cash) in my opinion.   We don't really order the salmon and other raw seafood but get just about everything else and I can't really complain about any of it. The tempora, green dragon, dynamite, eel, escargot, teriyaki chicken, other various sushi rolls, are all on par and delicious. Like I said, Sumo is a good spot that will get you your sushi fix and won't break the bank, but don't expect to get your mind blasted.   Service is never a problem as every single time we've been here there have been probably less than 4 groups of people (which is a bummer! Show sumo some love). We're never left unattended to and our food is always delivered on time. I give Sumo a solid 4 and have recommended it to my fellow peers."}
{"text":"The service is really good here, but if you go during lunch or dinner you might be waiting for service a little longer than usual. It's just understaffed sometimes.. been going here for the last couple months and I've noticed that the salmon has a very fishy taste now, might avoid the salmon sashimi now..."}
{"text":"This place was only okay. It wasn't busy over the holidays and I asked to sit away from the door as it was cold. The waitress gave me a dirty look but moved me. The food is okay for ayce and they also have an a la carte menu. We ate ayce and the food came out quickly enough. I was looking forward most to the torched sushi but it was not good. Barely torched and just drizzled with spicy mayo, this is not what I expected. I would come back in a pinch but there are better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"3.5  Servers were fantastic. Clean restaurant. Nice plates and cutlery.   Food was okay. Not the greatest but not bad. Lots if rice on the sushi so be careful when ordering.   Sashimi quality was standard ayce. Scallops, octopus, and sweet shrimp only on weekends.   Cooked foods were good. On par with kaka.  Menu is a bit small but not bad. Dessert menu is small too.  Parking can be tight as its in the same plaza as ten rens and Tim Hortons which can get busy.   Some orders were missed but they've only been open for a week.  Still trying to work out kinks in the system.   Check out my pics for more commentary.  I say it's worth a visit considering the 15 percent off."}
{"text":"2.5 star   Came here on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm.  First time here , probably last time here.  We came to try this new ayce and it was quite disappointing.   As we were being seated I was indecisive on which seat to sit at because one table had a bright light which hurts my eyes and the other table was uncomfortable.  The lady was giving me a rude looks even though I apologized for being annoying and indecisive.  So we ended up at a table and we ordered.  The lady was pretty clumsy she dropped the wasabi while i was ordering on the iPad and scared the hell out of me.   So the variety of selections are smaller than some of the other ayce. I wouldn't really recommend anything from the menu other than probably the salmon belly. It was very crispy and juicy pretty much the only thing I ordered more than once.  The sashimi wasn't fresh tasting and the cuts are really small. As said before the selection for sashimi is also very small for weekdays. On weekends you get scallop I think..    The menu is quite deceiving for example they have fried scallop but it would  actually be fish paste.  They would have fried chicken wings but it would be drumsticks.  They would have a seafood soup but it only has salmon and crab meat in the soup.     Anyway overall 2.5  because it was decent priced since they gave me 10% discount if paid in cash."}
{"text":"AMAZING service!!!! Great tempura, sushi was not the best but I'm not fan of sushi regardless. A decent place to grab a quick lunch or dinner at incredible prices!"}
{"text":"Always great to have another option for AYCE Japanese food, and this one isn't a bad choice. Decided to head over here with a couple friends that frequent AYCE with me often since they were offering a 15% off grand opening special!  The space was nice and simple, not going overboard with decor or ambience. A cozy, manageable size with enough seating, they area was well light and had a welcoming vibe.   As with the latest trend, Sumo offers iPads to assist with ordering. There is a great convenience to this, and orders get in really quick. Unlike other places I have been to, the iPads they had were well kept, and did not have issues on their screens making scrolling any harder than it needs to be.   They didn't have any outstanding or exceedingly memorable dishes, but the overall quality of the food was good. A couple notable mentions would include the Salmon Tartare, a couple of the Torched Sushi, and the sashimi was quite fresh. The Scallop Sashimi was especially good.  However, there were a couple dishes that could of improved. Overall, the meat options were rather limited and the ones they had left something to be desired.  Service was quite good and servers were quick on their feet when prompted or requested. A few times we did have to call over a server that was just standing around to get something or had to request something more than once. Areas to improve.   A nice spot that I can see getting busy in the future. Would definitely consider coming back another time I'm in the mood for AYCE."}
{"text":"Went there fir my friend bday dinner. Booking was very easy. We had a very big group over 18 people.  Seating was fine. I dont think they had enough staff working on a Saturday.  In all fairness we had a large group, so when everyone orders on a ipad they send the order right away but if you can imagen we had some order that were the same but ordered maybe 1 pc but with 4 to 5 of those same order. The staff was nice was not mad and ask if we could kindly order together that way they can bring it out at same time rather 5 to 8 of the same item but 1 pc.  Orderd pretty much i think the whole menu. Highlight for me are the sashimi. I find it fresh love the raw sweet shrimp nice tiny shirmps. I also like the bbq rib. The fried food that came were always hot which is excellent.  It the first place to have pan fried  rice cake. They were small but i love rice cake. The fried  chicken wing was nice as well. Tempura shrimp was very good the temperature  of the oil did not soak into the food it was nice and clean fried.   Sushi rolls were good, spicy salmon roll is one of my favorite. Sushi i like the red tuna, crab meat sushi and the sweet tofu sushi.  Overall not a bad place. They still have a 15% off promotion. I recommend if you go to call and ask if they still have the promo still.   Maybe add another sushi help/chef at the front. It was a lot of order and seeing the sushi chef making sushi non stop look like maybe adding 1 or 2 would be great on weekends. Food here was less salty, as the staff or owner did come ask us how was everything the 1st time i went and eating tonight i saw that the food was a bit salty which was good for me. I recommended that maybe some of the sauce  to be a bit less salty then that be great. I hope to see some new dishes come up. One idea maybe, corn salad sushi heheh thats be nice.   I will be going back here next time. Wait for me rice cakes. I know its doesnt taste much but something about rice cakes, could be because it was chewy."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sumo on a fairly consistent basis and while it's still my favorite Japanese AYCE restaurant, it's not as good as it used to be.  The food is still very good and I haven't been to any other Japanese AYCE restaurants that are quite as good.  I'll mention some below.  Sushi: About as fresh as you can get from AYCE and the rice has a nice flavor.  I would prefer about 2/3 of the rice on my nigiri, but AYCE restaurants always try to load up on the rice.  Deep fried items (chicken katsu, cheese wontons, scallops, etc.): Pretty much anything that has been deep fried by Sumo is really good.  Always very crispy on the outside without overcooking the insides.  Udon: The fried udon has great flavor and isn't loaded with veggies like some places try to do.  I get the chicken and there's a good amount of chicken in it.  The udon soup is below average.  The soup is a little salty and I prefer when there's a hint of sweetness.  Dessert: While they have standard ice creams, I enjoy their chocolate and strawberry mousse.  It's not overly sweet and is perfect to end the meal!  I also love their sesame balls.  Delicious!   The one thing that has taken a sharp nosedive is the service.  The service used to be fantastic with servers who genuinely cared, but this has been replaced by quite the opposite.  Last night my server sat me down at a table that was missing plates for a few of us and she didn't set up the tablet.  She seemed too busy sitting at another table and chatting with guests/friends.  We received more attention when these guests/friends left.  I've also noticed that there has been an increase in the number of items I don't receive after I place my order.  This used to be a rare occurrence but now I pretty much expect items will be forgotten about.  Overall, I still think Sumo has the best quality AYCE food in the Markham area.  However, the service is causing me to think about looking around for other alternatives."}
{"text":"One of the better all you can eat sushi restaurants around. Service is good and attentive. So far all our food has arrived promptly and they haven't missed anything. A good variety of food and the atmosphere is very comfortable. Would definitely come back. FYI the accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Sumo is good. Love coming here for their desserts, sushi, torched sushi and mussels. Yes, I would recommend this place. You order food from an I-pad, but sometimes the servers forgets some items, so don't order a lot at once. Do many rounds. Each month they do different promotions, so call ahead of time and ask. The servers were nice and friendly. The desserts are the best part, I love their strawberry mousse. I would order like 10 at a time. They also have chocolate mousses, mango pudding, and a few different flavoured ice cream."}
{"text":"This place had nice decor and the atmosphere was soothing, but overall, the food was not very satisfying. The sashimi and sushi were below expectations as it did not taste very fresh. In addition, some of the cooked food (ribs, chicken heart skewers) were simply too saucy and did not have enough flavour to the meat itself. However, the escargot was a pleasant surprise.   Overall, probably won't be back again. Would rather spend my money on other AYCE."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to try it out. $26 on weekends for all-day AYCE. Not down to pay that much for an AYCE lunch especially if there are more affordable deals elsewhere. Sashimi choice is quite limited and the rolls are mediocre. Decided on the torched lunch special for $10.50, which was just alright. Akasaka down the road would be the better option for price and quality."}
{"text":"I drove past this place a couple of weeks ago and made a mental note to try it the next time I was in the neighbourhood. That opportunity came up today. My cousin and I arrived around 2:00pm and I found it a bit curious that the place was almost empty, today of all days, Mothers Day, traditionally the busiest day in the restaurant industry.  Like a lot of AYCE sushi places I've been to, we placed our order through an app on an iPad. The food started arriving quickly, probably less than within a minute of ordering.  Everything looked okay but some of the portions looked tiny. That was okay since it meant we could order a wider variety of things and just keep ordering more if we were still hungry.  The food was just okay, not bad but not great. I've had better sushi at other places. The beef dishes were all overcooked (see beef enoki photo) and most dishes had too much sauce.  The service started out good, fast and efficient but halfway through our meal, it got slower. It took them longer to clear empty dishes. They brought an incorrect order to us. They forgot to bring a can of Coke and some ice cream. The table was full of empty plates when we asked for the bill. Forget the ice cream.  At $26.95 (for lunch), this was not a good value. Drinks were extra. Unfortunately, we left a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Updating my review: Came here recently for a sushi fix but found the service to be heavily lacking. Many items we ordered did not come out. Tough to leave a good review when you leave an AYCE hungry."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst AYCE I have been to. Not only was the food well below average, the service was even worse.   Lets start with the food. The pictures on the menu did not seem appealing at all. In addition, the variety was very limited with comparison to other AYCE restaurants. We got a variety of sashimi,  including salmon, white tuna, sweet shrimp, surf clams, and crab sticks (which was pretty much all they had- we're not fans of snappers in general). Understanding that sashimi may not be the best of quality, the sashimi at Sumo still did not meet our standards. It tasted bland, and the color did not have that shininess that fresh sashimi possesses. Furthermore, the crab sticks was very dry and tasted like it had been left out at room temperature for the whole day. The other cooked food (short ribs, chicken wings, chicken heart skewers etc.) were nothing special.  Now onto the service. As the restaurant is smaller than other AYCEs, and crowd was sparse (we went on a Wednesday), the service was fairly good and food arrived quickly. We were satisfied with our service until one of the employees snapped at us while taking our plates. She was unhappy with the fact that there were a few pieces of crab sticks remaining on the plate. She talked down to us with attitude that if we didn't like the food we shouldn't have ordered it. What she didn't understand was that we had 2 orders of the same sashimi plate, thus misleading her to believe that we placed 2 orders of crab sticks. While we understood that she simply did not want any food go wasted, the attitude she had in speaking to us was extremely rude and ruined our experience at this restaurant.  Needless to say, we will never be back."}
{"text":"We went on Sunday before family day. Quiet as usual until 7:30 hit and suddenly the restaurant was packed and people were waiting which is rare. Good thing we got our first couple orders in before our next few were totally lost. understandable as the chefs were likely getting a ton from all the new tables. We waited half an hour for our second order and they didn't even have time it seemed to get our desserts which took another 20 minutes as they were overwhelmed it seems.    Normally this would not have been acceptable for us but it's family day - we get it and we're chill, not like we have anywhere to go tomorrow.  Just wanted to mention the great service from who I think is the owner as he was the only one not in uniform. Cheerful and courteous to everyone despite running around and slightly flustered after making sure everyone in the restaurant got what they ordered. Even wished us a happy family day as he took our bill which was something he did not need to do with the restaurant being so busy. It's good to appreciate the small things."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place but for the most part its a great Japanese AYCE restaurant. Came here on a Saturday night at around 7pm. I made a reservation ahead of time but it wasn't really needed as there were empty tables throughout the night. $26.95 on weekends for AYCE and they were still running their 15% off grand opening special. Tablet ordering system which is very easy to follow. I didn't like how they didn't really have booth seating for more privacy. Also didn't like how when the doors opened the cool air would come in even though we were seated in the back of the restaurant.  Overall the food was good. The sashimi was fresh and sliced to decent sizes. As for the foods that were cooked they came out hot and fresh as well.   Some things I noticed about the food:  - the beef ribs were really fatty - there was no beef sashimi on the menu :( - the torched sushi did have a torched taste but I didn't really care for the torched flavour - the tempura shrimps were nice and crispy - the escargot were small and the taste was overpowered by the cheese and mushroom - the fried salmon belly was really tasty - the mussels were also large and tasted fresh - the seaweed used on the eel hand roll was so fresh and crispy and tasted great - the scallop sashimi which is only available on weekends were small and didn't really taste that great or even that fresh. I would not come here just because they have scallop sashimi. - shrimp sashimi were also very small but tasted A-Okay - the desserts which consisted mostly of ice cream were very good  In terms of service I thought it was above average for a Japanese AYCE. They hired enough staff, food arrived in a timely manner and we got all our orders except one.   I give it a solid 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday with my dad to try and it would've been a 4 star rating if the udon didn't taste like dirty dish water. When they put down our udon, the smell was so strong...idk if it was just strong smelling dish soap but it was so overwhelming that I had 1 bite of udon and spat it out. My dad ate some of it but I told him to stop after a couple bites. To be fair I don't think the actual udon was the problem but they need to fix that smell ASAP. Change the dish soap or something.   Onto the good stuff: The sashimi was on par with usual ayce places - sweet shrimp on a weekday is awesome! I had about 40 haha.   The torched sushi was alright. I liked the salmon the best. They also have ika (squid) and red tuna sushi which is always nice.   We only tried the soft shell crab roll which had a good amount of soft shell crab and not too much rice.   The cooked food was pretty good - tempura, mushroom beef roll, ribs were a little fatty but flavour was good.   The bill came to $50 (10% off if you pay cash) which is the norm for ayce sushi. If only that udon wasn't so bad..."}
{"text":"We came here last night after finding out on Yelp that they offer torched sushi. The interior has not changed much since it was Inatei many years ago; the tables are very well spaced apart.  For a Tuesday night, it was pretty quiet; there were about 4 tables at any given time in the night. When we got seated, we had the option for a-la-carte or AYCE...obviously chose AYCE!  The pricing is $25 on weekday dinner and $27 on weekends; comparable to all the other AYCE around the area. There is currently a 15% grand opening discount (they accept cash/credit/debit). We placed our order with an iPad.  The quality of the fish wasn't bad, very fresh and generous pieces...however, I would only recommend ordering sashimi and not so much the sushi. I was quite disappointed to find out that octopus and scallop is only offered during the weekend.   The rice in the sushi was awful; large balls of rice which was cooked with too much water (mistake or deliberate? not sure, but it was a very dense mushy mess!).  They offer six different types of fish with the torched sushi served with spicy mayo on the side, which was quite tasty.   I did not try much of the cooked foods, but of the selection includes your typical tempuras, skewers, cheese mussel, escargot, scallop, fried rice, udon, edamame, etc.. though I did not find the selection to be nearly as great as other AYCE in the area within the price range, such as Kiku down the street.  The desserts were great as well, with your choice of vanilla/green tea/mango/red bean ice cream, strawberry/chocolate mousse, coconut milk pudding and mango sago.  Overall, the service was great and the staff were very attentive.. unfortunately the food was meh. I don't know if I would come back, as there are many other AYCE options in the area that have a lot more to offer."}
{"text":"Came here on a monday night for a birthday dinner of 10. Service was excellent: friendly staff and food came quickly to our tables. Quality of the sashimi and sushi was very good and they even have torched sushi. My only complaint is that there is no beef sashimi but who knows, maybe they will eventually add more items to their menu. Currently they have a 15% off grand opening special. I think this is one of the better sushi buffets in Richmomd Hill and definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Sumo's a reasonably new Japanese all you can eat restaurant.  You make your order on an iPad and it comes out!  Easy!  I went here once with my girlfriend for dinner.  When we entered, it felt like the waitress that seated us really didn't want to be there.  She sat us and someone else had to get the iPad ready to go.  I didn't see her the rest of the night so maybe she was finishing a shift or something.  The younger fellow there was very pleasant though so that was nice.  He made sure to ask if we were full at the end too, which I like.  The food itself is good quality.  The tempera batter was very crispy and the sweet potato/broccoli (was very happy to see this one in particular on their menu) were cooked well inside.  The udon's alright, but the cutlet inside it really isn't impressive at all.  It's like it was soaked in there before it came to us.  Would prefer a plain udon in this case.  The chicken cutlet was also great - not dried out with a tasty outside and good sauce.  Also worth noting is that the mousse seems to be very popular.  My girlfriend had ten of these by the time we were done.  I was very full by the time I left.  Nothing I'd call \"mind-blowing\", but all still good!  Edit: Something worth noting is that they're constantly upgrading their menu by adding items, which is extremely nice to see.  I've been here a few more times with family and/or friends now.  They're currently having their 10% off promotion when you use cash (as of December 2015).  I believe the price before that is $27 for a weekend dinner per person.  At the discount, it's worth it.  Only thing is they don't really advertise the promotion - it's not on their windows or any site.  I'm sure you could phone and ask.  All in all, this is definitely a place I recommend going to if you're in the mood for Japanese food.  Most everything there is well made and the service is great for the most part."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner - Fri @ 6:30 ish and the place was empty - not a good sign, ummm. The menu and ordering is with ipads so you have to share one ipad with everyone at the table - hi tech, yes - convenient, no.  Not feeling like ayce sushi we ordered the fixed bento dinners and an order of calamari to start.  That was a big mistake (not as big as going there in the first place).  The 6 rings of calamari were coated with a plaster like batter that you could literally tap on the table to make a noise. Not only was the batter hard but the squid was chewy.   On to the bento boxes.The tempura in the bento was similar but not as bad - you expect light crispy not heavy hard.  How can you mess up California rolls - well, they found a way - the rice was not seasoned properly and too mushy.  The beef teriyaki under seasoned and tough as were the short ribs.  The salmon got a pass and  deemed okay. The fixed dinners did come with a salad and miso but not a dessert (which is uncommon - usually green tea ice cream at most places). Service was passable, slow to clear dishes and had to ask for a tea refill but the dishes came out fairly quickly. Not a place I would revisit or recommend."}
{"text":"I was craving ramen. I hadn't been back to this restaurant. Well, look here! New restaurant name and sign. It's now Sumo Restaurant.   The interior looks the same, except that the booths don't exist on the far west side. It is an all-you-can-eat sushi bar now. I didn't feel like gorging, so I ordered a la carte.   The tea tasted like it was brewed with rice. I love that!  The server showed me how to order on the snazzy iPad. I ordered edamame, fried beef udon, and mango tapioca pudding for dessert. No technology glitches. Bonus!  The edamame was perfect. It had more salt than I am used to. Considering that I am nursing a sore throat, I will take the extra salt! You get a decent portion, which makes this edamame lover happy.   I really wanted ramen, which this restaurant does not serve. I went with the fried beef udon. It was okay. I'm not big on zucchini and large pieces of onion, and black pepper that was in the dish. The udon noodles were perfect.   The mango tapioca pudding was the perfect serving for me. It was small, but I didn't want anything huge. It was $1.50.   I'll come back to try the sushi and sashimi when I have a normal appetite. The only downside was service. It took almost an hour to get a refill on my tea. Had I not ordered dessert, I wouldn't have been able to ask for a tea refill, as the entire staff had lunch at 3:30 pm!"}
{"text":"Decor: 4 Food: 3.5 Service: 4  There's finally a new ayce Japanese restaurant in the neighborhood! We were pretty excited to try this place.  We went on a weekday and it was $24.99, which was pretty reasonable since fish was fresh. We ordered a lot of sashimi and their torched sushi. I personally liked the sashimi more than the torched sushi.  Octopus and scallop sashimi are only offered on the weekend but that's pretty common, so I'm not sure why a yelper said she was disappointed.  If you would like scallop, there is a diced scallop sushi that you could order.  The garlic beef was quite chewy and over cooked. Salmon asparagus and bacon asparagus were both a bomb! They gave us thin asparagus so it made it extra delicious! Remember to order zucchini too!  Food came quick and service was excellent.  We would definitely come back!  They still have the 15% grand opening discount and it's not cash only. They accept MC, Visa and AMEX."}
{"text":"Sumo is your slightly above average AYCE sushi restaurant.  Tip: They take 10% off if you pay in cash.  Sumo was pretty empty on a Tuesday night that I came in.  The restaurant was bright and seemed very clean.  They also have the iPad ordering system.  Food here is very average.  Sumo tries to be creative and add items to their menu that other restaurants wouldn't but ... for example, they have \"spicy\" miso soup - which is literally miso soup + sriracha.   Their torched sushi was very, very, very average and did not add to my dinner. The best part was their sweet shrimp - this usually comes out on weekends in other restaurants; so having it on a weekday was a bonus.  They do have scallops and octupus which are restricted for the weekends.  Their teppanyaki and cooked section was good but nothing that tops other restaurants.  Do try their sumo rolls - it looks weird but does taste good.  $28 for a average week-day meal.  I won't be back for a while just because I want to try others AYCE but I won't complain if I get dragged here with friends."}
{"text":"I always drove by this place and wanted to try it and I did last night. I wasn't really have high expectations for AYCE but this place was actually pretty good. The torched sushi was really good. In my opinion, for the sushi, the amount of rice they use was actually perfect. A lot of AYCE places have way too much rice, but this place does it well. The teppanyaki foods were also good. The only thing I didn't really like was the beef with garlic teppanyaki.. the beef was cut too small so it was way overcooked and chewy. But other than that, I would for sure come back!  Also, I think the 15% discount is still going, but I think it's only if you pay with cash."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I think this AYCE sushi restaurant recently opened in Oct/Nov.  One thing to note that they have the exact same AYCE menu for both lunch and dinner and its the same price for both lunch and dinner ($27 per person). Like many new AYCE sushi placed, you order through the iPad. 90% of our items came out; the other 10% needed reminders which is not bad.   1) seaweed was very soggy and salty. 2) Sushi quality is pretty decent for AYCE standard. They have spider roll (which is usually not offered at other AYCE); spider roll is a bit disappointing though; too salty.  We liked the: spicy salmon, spicy tuna, rainbow, black and green dragon, twin dragon. Rolls were good; not too much rice.  Hand rolls were yummy.   3) We didn't like the grilled items that much. Beef ribs were too fatty and the steak cubes were too chewy.  Escargo was good, interesting taste.  4) sashimi was fresh for the most part; salmon, tuna, red snapper, surf clam were fresh.  Octopus and scallop sashimi (only available on weekend) were kinda fishy IMO. I didn't enjoy these two.  5) Torched sushi were okay; nothing fancy. I prefer the non-torched sushi better. It's nice that they offer torched sushi as an option.   5) Last, dessert selection was quite small. I'm disappointed with dessert menu. There were ice cream (green tea, vanilla, mango, and red bean), mousse (Strawberry and chocolate), and pudding (coconut and mango milk pudding). I had the green tea; taste like green tea ice cream anywhere else. Mango pudding was not very good.  My hubby was disappointed that they didn't have deep fried banana to go with his ice cream   Overall, sushi quality is good for AYCE standard; didn't like grilled items or the desserts. Price is a bit steep though."}
{"text":"Sumo has a special place in my heart. When I'm craving AYCE sushi, Sumo is there for me and they open late and offer my favorite dishes such as green dragon, dynamite, and pretty much the basics such as tempura, teriyaki chicken, and more. It's a shame they don't have more customers because I think they do a good job.   The quality of food is quite good. Dishes came out fast and they have a decent menu, but I'm guessing the lack of patronage is because of other places such as Matsuda and Kiku. They have higher prices, but much more variety and slightly better quality. Sumo is a good option for AYCE sushi that is cheaper than other Markham AYCE ($25 here if you pay cash compared to $35). One of my favorite dishes here is the blow torched shrimp which is to die for. So addicting.   Service is very good. We usually get this waitress in the evenings and she's very nice and attentive. I wish they did a AYCE lunch service but at a lower price because at the moment it's the same price as dinner. I also think dessert is lacking. It's uninspiring and not as tasty.   4/5. Sumo is one of my favorite sushi places where I don't blow a budget and satisfy my sushi cravings. They have issues to work out but I like Sumo."}
{"text":"So this is the newest restaurant in the neighbourhood. I think it's the fourth or fifth restaurant in that space in the past 7 years.  It's located in a small plaza with a ten ren, Tim's, and Popeye. Lots of parking, can get full though on the weekend evenings.  So they renovated a bit. It's nice, bright, clean, and stylish.  The food. It's all you can eat or a la carte.    It's an iPad ordering place. They have a lot of choices. There is something for everyone.  The food is good. Not great. It's like a typical ayce. One thing, the rice was mushy. That's the big complaint about the food.  My favourite dishes were the vegetarian ones. The vegetable tappenaki is amazing. We got it by accident. We didn't order it, it just showed up.   Servers were nice. There were only a few tables taken but when we wanted our bills we had to wait a long while to find someone and ended up flagging down one of the servers as she was leaving. She got someone. With tax and tip it was 30 bucks, that was with a discount.  Yikes. Will not be back."}
