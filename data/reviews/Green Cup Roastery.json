{"text":"I can not speak to the other reviewer's experience with the Americano as I've never ordered one there; however, I can stay that the brewed coffee is good. It's better than when the establishment first opened. The dark roasts actually have a rich flavour now, whereas I found them weak in the past.  A new owner has recently incorporated hot breakfast items which I enjoyed. The pancake was a bit funny-tasting last week, but the eggs, bacon and home fries were good enough. They also have simple hot food for lunches as well (burgers, hot dogs, etc.) I think the hot food menu items will expand and improve if there is a good response, so check it out and see what you think.  There are also cold sandwiches and things in the case as well as desserts. In fact, they seem to be working with a new baker, too. The carrot cake I had today was really delicious. Wonderfully moist and awesome cream cheese frosting.   I am also a fan of the tea selections.   I think the thing Green Cup might most profit from are some guidelines about sound levels. When I arrived today the music was at a comfortable enough volume that I could hear the people I was with, but then another employee came and suddenly it was really loud and we couldn't hear each other. I understand there may be times there is an event going on like open mike or something, but for general use I think some discussion with the employees on some kind of standard would be useful.  The upstairs has improved a lot, too, with small individual tables instead of the big long table.  All in all this is a place I like and visit regularly, and I hope you will, too."}
{"text":"Oh the original colours of this place were horrendous. Think bright orange!  This time round you will find more subdued colours with just a hint of the orange that once was.  It's your average cafe but here in B-town, it is a great place to go to with hours from 8-midnight and wi-fi.    That being said I had the most horrendous americano in my life. It was a a single shot americano in a tall glass filled almost to the top with water. I was in a bit of shock. The girl bend the counter noticed the expression on my face and asked if I wanted to add more. I semi laughed and said no.  When I think about it, I really should have told her that she put too much water to begin with.   It has the craziest second level. It contains a long table with an extension for whatever you need to plug  in. They sadly blocked off the section where the windows are for their offices. A real shame because that upstairs section could be beautiful!"}
