{"text":"Some of the best food I have ever had. Made with love and care, Silvia and her family make you feel at home. You will not leave hungry! Try the gnocchi. Great wine selection, as well!"}
{"text":"We went here tonight to experience the Summerlicious 2013 menu. The exterior of the restaurant is old however the inside was a pleasant surprise.The space is very small and quite congested.   The service wasn't anything spectacular. I asked for water with lemon twice throughout our meal and only managed to get a jug with lemons pictured on it. Coincidence ? The food was mediocre.  The best part was the dessert.   We wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Service was terrible-felt totally ignored all night which was unfortunate because the food was very good.  Very slow start-had to ask for water, had to ask what specials there were and was never asked if we wanted coffee or dessert. Because of the total lack of service won't rush back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to La Bruschetta for Summerlicious 2013.  For any \"licious\" event I do not set my expectations very high, so I wasn't super disappointed or surprised at the mediocre dinner and service we received.   We had an early reservation, so when we arrived there was only one other table sat. The staff were at the back standing around the bar or sitting at tables. Some looked at us, but no one came over for at least a couple minutes - it was so weird! The man who finally sat us ended up being our server. He was snobby beyond belief and pretty much secured our unwillingness to return.   The food was hit or miss, with my husband getting most of the hits. He had the meatball appetizer (Polpette della Nonna) and I had the peach and arugula salad (Insalata Umbra). I was so jealous when the meatball was tender, flavourful and in a delicious sauce and my salad was overdressed in a sour vinaigrette.  My main was the clam spaghettini (Spaghetti alle Vongole) which looked a bit sad and tasted worse. There was no flavour other than salt and the clams were chewy and grainy. The homemade pasta was good though, so I was wishing I had chosen something else.   The tiramisu dessert was amazing - light, creamy and spiked with string coffee. Could this redeem the whole experience...  I would not return to La Bruschetta. Summerlicious is an opportunity for restaurants to bring in new customers and wow them so they will return. By giving second rate service and not giving special attention to the food and menu, La Bruschetta missed an opportunity."}
{"text":"Incredible food and reasonable prices.  You feel like family here.  I cannot say enough good things about the food, ambiance and staff.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The pasta was delicious, the wine is top shelf, and the staff are incredible. If you are around la bruschetta, it is a must!!"}
{"text":"This meal blew me away.  I'm from out of town and was told to go here by a local.  Incredible.  It just kept getting better and better.  Jumbo shrimp the size of my fist.  In a sauce that I'm going to dream about.  The pasta in meat sauce was good, but the wild mushroom pasta was AMAZING!  And that Tartuffo for dessert.  Perfect meal.  Lovely owners.  Great servers.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Family run authentic Italian restaurant. Wonderful owners. Benito still cooks and is nearly always there while his daughter Silvia (who is amazing) runs the business. You won't be disappointed. Have the gnocchi."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here on Saturday night and Sil is just amazing! We  had not been to the restaurant for some time and she remembered us and even recalled where we were sitting the last time.  I can't say enough good things about this restaurant and I can't wait to take more of our friends to experience it.  Just about everything on the menu is delicious but  if you are not sure, let Sil  put something together for you. She put together two plates of various pastas and it was delicious.The  LINGUINI ALLA BOLOGNESE and GAMBERONI ALLA DIAVOLOSA  are out of this world and this is the closest thing to home cooked you will ever find. That is, if your mother is a great  cook.   What was so nice is several times through the course of the evening Sil came over to our table pulled up a chair and chatted with us and that makes all the difference in the world. It was like we were dining at an old friend's house.  And thank you Colin for your attentive and excellent service!  I would recommend this restaurant to anybody, except for maybe a  children's birthday party."}
{"text":"This place is a bit out of my regular path so I was quite excited to check it out when given the opportunity. I came here with my girlfriends and we had a great evening with the Winterlicious Menu.   The Atmosphere -remarkable. It is esthetically pleasing. I especially enjoy the plates on walls and the mosaic tiling by the bar. It is a cozy restaurant with great dining potential.  The Food - fabulous. Not only do they give you bread to start, they also wet your palate with well Bruschetta. I must warn you though. The hot pepper concoction they bring to the table, small doses my friends... I had upper lip sweat like there was no tomorrow.  - The winterlicious menu is extensive. Alot of the restaurants have a small menu and don't really showcase the variety or the details of their regular menu.   - The bad part about this restaurant is that while Winterlicious is on, they only serve from that menu, not from their regular menu.  The Staff - Everyone was extremely pleasant and very knowledgeable about their menu.   Definitely make the commute to La Bruschetta. You don't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here on the first night of winterlicious because of the gnocchi! Found parking nearby for pretty cheap.  It was a small quaint restaurant with not many people inside. The waiter who was also the owner was very nice and humorous. We had a pitcher of the sangria which was nice but had an interesting flavor to it that I wasn't a total fan of. They gave complimentary brushetta and bread, which was really nice. I had the wild boar meatballs which definitely didn't go too well with me. Not a fan of pork but I tried to be adventurous. It was very juicy though so maybe pork fans might really like it. I had the gorgonzola gnocchi which I thought was yum. It does have a strong blue cheese taste to it that after awhile made me feel a bit nauseous. But still I think it was a good choice. I had the Nutella gelato with Nutella on top and it was scrumptious. It had a wafer in it that had a weird taste but I just took it out. Overall it was a nice experience but I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"This was one of the best dining experiences I have had. Wonderful family owned Italian. The people are what make this special."}
{"text":"Last night my girlfriend and I went to La Bruschetta for the annual Winterlicious event. Here are my thoughts regarding our dining experience: - I ordered the following items:  1. Appetizer - soup of the day - it was a bowl of vegetable consomme. 2. Entree - I chose the fettuccine with veal meatballs. 3. Dessert - Tiramisu  Appetizer: The pluses: it was served hot, was a good sized portion, and had a good variety of vegetables.  The minuses: it tasted like there was a bit too much salt.  Entree: The pluses: it was a good sized portion, the fettuccine seemed fresh. The minuses: they skimped on the amount of meatballs. There were only three provided. The sauce was a bit on the bland side.  Dessert: The pluses: the tiramisu was tasty. The minuses: it was a bit soggy, and the portion size was quite small.  My girlfriend ordered the following items: greens for an appetizer, pasta (I can't quite remember what they  called it, but it was cut short and had a twist to it, and was doused in a cheesy type of sauce with some mushrooms), and Tartufo for dessert.  I had a brief taste of her entree and her dessert and can say that she made a better choice than myself.  As far as the dining experience was concerned, I have mixed things to say. On the bright side, they were able to accommodate us as we made a reservation only a few hours before dinner.  On the negative side, we were delayed arriving because of heavy rush hour traffic. When we arrived, the hostess told us to wait in the narrow hallway (note: there was no where to sit and we had to awkwardly get out of the way when people wanted to get by us). We ended up waiting around a half hour to be seated. We were directed to their upstairs dining room.  While the room was not significantly large (maybe a dozen tables), it was quite noisy, and often at times I found I had to ask my girlfriend to repeat what she was saying in order to hear her.  As far as service was concerned, while the waiters were quite friendly, there were only two staffed upstairs, and we found that we had to ask multiple times to have our water glasses refilled.  Probably the best part of the meal was the glass of sangria that we had beforehand.  On the whole, I'd say that for the price that was paid ($40/each tax & tip incl.) the meal was on the average side.  Of note what I thought was cool (some would consider kitschy), was the fact that in the opening hallway, they have dozens of plates that have been signed by noteworthy people, hanging on the wall. Thus if you do have to wait for a table for a while, you at least have something to entertain you while you wait."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious dinner last night, after wanting to try this place for a while. It was OK at best, and mediocre at worst.   The good:  1. Complimentary bruschetta is pretty good and a nice touch.  2. The salad appetizers were both good, with the Rossa being a clear favourite. The Noce was good too.  3. Service was efficient and friendly.  4. The house red was quite good, and served in cute old-school glasses.  5. The decor is charming.   6. Street parking is affordable and abundant.  The bad:  1. During Winterlicious, their a la carte menu is off-limits--meaning, they won't make anything a la carte for you. This forces you to order from their Winterlicious menu whether you intended to or not.  2. The mains were not good. We ordered the Pomodoro and Capellini pastas, and they were both bad. The pomodoro was over-salted and didn't have much flavour, and the capellini lacked flavour as well. The pasta itself was clearly overcooked, and not al dente, as you would expect from an Italian joint. When they arrived, they were lukewarm, and you could tell they had been reheated because of the texture of the sauces. I could make pasta ten times better than this, and I am not a chef by any stretch of the word.  3. The desserts were not good. The tartufo was OK, but it was clearly store-bought. The profiterols were gross and also clearly store-bought.   Bottom line: If you need to eat, $28/person for a three-course meal is a steal, but don't expect to be impressed. I won't be back.  Edit: Yes, I'm aware every restaurant has a special menu for winterlicious. My issue is that this restaurant refuses to make anything from their regular menu, thereby forcing you to order from Winterlicious. Other restaurants, maybe not all, allow you to order a la carte during winterlicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful Corsa Italia classic italian place; a real neighborhood feel, with excellent food and professional, very knowledgable service.   They start you off with bruschetta with wonderful fresh tomatoes.  We each had an appetizer (scallops, and gnocchi) -- the gnocchi was maybe the best I've ever had, very light and fluffy, and the scallops were done perfectly and in a lovely subtle sauce.   We had a terrific salad, and finished with a wonderful fettuccini prosecco with lobster and a beautiful rich Osso buco.   An orange Ripieno and espresso finished things perfectly.   Staff were friendly and terrific; a wonderful night, and we'll come here again to treat ourselves soon."}
{"text":"My wife, kid and me met my parents and brother here. Overall we enjoyed ourselves. Although, we felt a bit cramped where we were seated. Some highlights: literally everyone's pasta dishes were great, nicest wines at affordable prices, big grappa list and the tiramasu was delicious... would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"One of the highlights of our visit to Toronto. We had a wonderful chat with the owner who is very involved in the running of the restaurant and seems to know almost every patron who walks through her door. The food is delicious and authentic. Definitely give the gnocchi a go it's amazing! We let the owner guide us in our food and wine choices and we weren't disappointed. A must try if you like good Italian food"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and wonderful food. If there's Tartuffo as a dessert option, get it- it's imported from Italy. I can see why this place has so many diehard regulars!!"}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious with some friends on a Saturday evening.  I was happy to see that we were started off with some of the namesake bruschetta. I found the bread tasted a bit stale for my liking, but overall fairly tasty.  My appetizer was a salad with peaches, bocconcini, almost, and a balsamic mustard vinaigrette. The peaches were substituted without notice for figs, which were delicious.  My main course was the ciangale spaghetti with wild boar meatballs and truffle cheese. The meatballs were juicy and flavorful although the sauce was a little disappointing.  The panna cotta for desert was quite delicious, although it left a rather unappetizing taste in my mouth moments later. The tiramisu one of my dining companions order was apparently quite delicious.  Overall, the food was quite good, although given the price of the dishes, I would think twice about returning."}
{"text":"A very special place full of good energy and authentic italian food. The wonderfully-charming Benito and his family run this restaurant with care and with love. The food is wonderful; the wine selection very thoughtful, and there are always surprises, like cheeses that Benito has aged himself. Ask him about how they make their pasta.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Were here last night treating a friend to dinner.  This is not a cheap restaurant, but the food is first rate.  Traditional Italian (not updated or North American Italian) with a seeming emphasis on dishes from central Italy (Lazio, Umbria, etc.)  I ordered a non-Italian appetizer, Caesar salad, but it was one of the best I have had in a while (note, they do use anchovies in the dressing so be forewarned if you don't like them).  Our friend had buffalo mozzarella over tomatoes, also wonderful.  We all split an order of carpaccio.  The virtually fat free paper thin meat slices were bather in lemon juice and topped with a lot of shredded (not grated) parmesan and were heavenly.  The main dishes were just as good - the specialty veal bruschetta was great and I ordered rigatoni with ground lamb, mushrooms and truffle oil which was melt in the mouth perfect.  A gratis portion of good bruschetta comes with the meal.  Beware of the olive oil served with the bread  - it is hot pepper flavoured and really HOT!  Nice service but we were there when the place was empty.  Too full for dessert.  One minor quibble was that for a place of this caliber, serving the parmesan for the pasta in a little sprinkler seems a bit declasse.  A chunk in a grater would have been nicer.  Decor is pleasant but not fancy.  Expect to spend about $45-50 per person without drinks, tax and tip."}
{"text":"Always excellent.  You never leave hungry! Home cooked, fresh and a little taste of heaven!"}
{"text":"We were back here on New Year's Eve.  Once again, we were totally blown away.  The food was outstanding.  What really got me was that we had a friend with us who has serious food allergies and the owner simply sat down with us to figure out exactly what our friend could eat.  That was seriously great service! I will happily go back anytime."}
{"text":"Had not been to La Bruschetta for years but it is still just as delicious as ever.  The complimentary Bruschetta is divine!  My friend and I shared a Caesar salad and they split it into 2 in the kitchen, nice!  My friend had the Linguini Alla Bolognese (this is not your average tomato meat sauce!) which she enjoyed immensely, and I had the Pappardelle Tartufate, thick bands of pasta in a mushroom sauce with garlic, wine and brandy, very rich and flavourful.  The only disappointment was that they did not have Profiteroles or Tiramisu for dessert, so we split their special Tartufo in Baileys which was served in a fancy martini glass.  The service was great, our waiter attentive and entertaining.  I won't let it fall off my radar and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious and it was pretty much exactly what I expected.  It was delicious food with friendly staff.  I had a veal stew served on polenta, which was extremely flavourful.  The panna cotta desert was probably the best I've tasted.  Their calamari is exactly what you'd expect from a quality Italian place.  Normally, I'd give this place 4 stars, but there was just one thing that was a bit weird about this place that took a star off (and honestly I don't know if maybe it should gain a star or lose a star because of it...).  The ground floor was full when we got there, so they seated us in the upstairs dining room.  The tables and chairs up there look straight out of grandma's kitchen (if grandma bought her furniture in 1982).  In some ways, it made the place feel cheap; in other ways, it made it feel homey.  Either way, I'd recommend this restaurant to someone wanting the St. Clair West experience."}
{"text":"Went here with two friends for dinner during Winterlicious. We came in at 7:45, there were only about four other tables present. We weren't immediately greeted at the door and we weren't immediately given water once we were seated though asides from those two mishaps, the owner is very kind. We were given bruschetta and bread to start.  For appetizers, we had the Polpette di Cingiale (wild boar meat balls), Cozze Alla Sambuca (fresh mussels), and Carpaccio e Frisse (thin cut roasted beet with poached shrimp ... salad). Good sized portions. The meatballs were juicy and tasted good but the mussels were heavenly. The Sambuca and roasted cherry tomato broth with cream that came with the mussels were to die for. Needless to say, my friend devoured every last drip of it. The table of two next to us both had mussels as well. A group that came in a bit after us tried to order the mussels but unfortunately, they were told that they had ran out of them.    For entrees, we were told that the Tagliatelle con Arragosta (homemade pasta with lobster and shrimp) was replaced with a lobster ravioli and that the ribs weren't going to be ready for another two hours (a shame because we arrived at 7:45) and that they were doing some sort of veal dish as a replacement. My friends ended up with the veal dish and the lobster ravioli while I had the Baccala (fresh cod). The veal did not look appetizing but it tasted alright to me, the lobster ravioli tasted good, and the cod was good but portion was really small.  Though my friend said that the veal was disappointing and that the ravioli wasn't very good.    For dessert, we all had the Tiramisu and so did almost every other diner. It was absolutely delicious.  The two stars of the night were the mussels and Tiramisu. The meals were spaced nicely apart.  Overall, it was a good experience and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"My review is based on my experience for Summerlicious 2012.  Maybe just the food I ordered? My Vegetarian Date was really happy and enjoyed her meal while I was totally disappointed!  Dinner for $25 definitely not a bad price for a 3 course meal, I ordered:  Appetizer: Porchetta - One of the driest pork I ever ate... Overcooked? Even hurt my mouth when I was chewing on it - Polenta on the side was pretty good though  Main: Linguine alla Pescatora  - seafood was not fresh and the tomato sauce was bland - I forced myself to eat half of it, while my date wondering what's wrong?! (I wish she can try some of those chewy seafood!)  Desert: Tiramisu - Best part of the meal - great liquors flavour, soft and rich....  I don't think I would come back to La Bruschettta with all these Italian restaurants all around the GTA....   Service though is really good, but not enough to make up for the food!"}
{"text":"I've dined at La Bruschetta twice and both times were amazing.  From outside, it looks rather plain, but once you get inside, it's intimate and inviting. The house white went perfectly with my stuffed trout.  The servings were well-portioned and the service was great.  This is definitely my favourite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome family run restaurant. It is frequented by a lot of regulars and I am one of them. The food is fantastic and the staff are charming and fun.  Highly recommend you check it out."}
