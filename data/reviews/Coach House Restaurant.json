{"text":"Definitely an old-school greasy-spoon. While our server was very nice, the man we paid at the front counter was rude, practically tossing our change on the counter. I was very surprised to experience such a low level of customer service in Toronto which in my opinion is known for its high standard of customer service. Food-wise, the bacon seemed pre-cooked and re-heated because it was the hardest bacon I've ever had. Toronto has WAY too many restaurants cooking great food that would value your business. Don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"Good food here. Some of the better Peameal (Canadian) Bacon I've had in a while. Good stuff. Plus - I love the old beer cans on the shelf. It has an old-style charm."}
{"text":"It looks like a nice family owned place but then come the downsides: the breakfast took over 40 minutes to arrive and when we asked about it the response was \"can't you see we're busy?\", so I decided to help them with the 'busy' part & not go there again"}
{"text":"Perfect little greasy spoon. Décor stuck in a time warp, cozy little booths and stools along the bar, friendly service and tasty plates of classic diner breakfasts. Good prices, hot coffee, peameal bacon and eggs... one of a breed of little family restaurants that are becoming more and more scarce in Toronto and a hidden gem amongst the odd mix of businesses along Yonge. Enjoy it while it's still here!"}
{"text":"Went there on St. Patrick's day at noon.  The restaurant was packed, but my boyfriend and I managed to get a table pretty quickly.  We ordered bacon, eggs, toast, potatoes, soup and a grilled cheese sandwich.  The food was good.  You can't really go wrong when you have a bottle of ketchup on hand.  I would've given it a 5 star, but the service was terrible.  We were served by a young male waiter who I am assuming was new because he was aloof and seemed lost half the time.  He had to be reminded after we had been waiting for10 minutes by the attentive head waitress who probably saw the frustration on our faces to take our order.  30 minutes later our bowl of soup arrived.  45 minutes minute after we were seated the rest of our meal arrived which included a burnt sandwich.  I can't really blame the waiter for the slow arrival of our meal, but he could clearly see that the sandwich was burnt yet he still served it.  When we asked for a new one, a new one came surprisingly a few minutes later with no apologies from him, but instead from the head waitress as we were paying. While we had extremely slow service all throughout, ironically, as soon as we were done our meal, he was there in a flash to clear our plates.
I would give this place a second chance but not a third if we get that same kind of service.  It shouldn't take 30-40 minutes to cook some eggs, grill a cheese sandwich, put together on a plate some cooked bacon, toast, potatoes, and pour some soup into a bowl."}
{"text":"I love this place big time. Blink and you'll miss it, but it's right at the corner of Yonge and Wellesley on the northwest side. You'd be hard pressed to find a restaurant in the area that gives you better value for your money. The food is always consistently good and delicious. Lots of options to choose from. My personal faves include the souvlaki and the banquet burger. The staff are equally awesome. The decor is also pretty cool and you'll feel like you stepped back in time to the early/mid 80s."}
{"text":"The star rating which swayed me to go to this restaurant is clearly a gross misrepresentation of what this place actually gave me for breakfast. First up, I think the two grandpas in the kitchen should visit a few other restaurants to get a sense of what is out there and what people actually eat. I'm sorry gents, they are not poached eggs and that potato stuff you piled on my plate was obviously cooked in last night's dinner oil because it made the potato taste like all kinds of other stuff. They didn't do lattes. They scoffed at making a milkshake. The decor was ordinary but now that's being too picky I know, so I will stop. It is quite evident that friends and family have been adding to these Yelp reviews. I have been travelling through North America for the last 6 weeks and this is by far the worst place I have eaten at. 
I can not comment on their lunch and dinners but their breakfasts are total garbage. 
To the staff: please visit some other restaurants in your area and order similar things that are on your menu and get an understanding of what is on offer out there. Consider this as constructive criticism. I wish I had better things to say but I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through. Very Poor."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is fantastic. The staff are polite and the service is very quick, even when it's busy. 
My favourite brunch place in the city"}
{"text":"Traditional family-run diner. Looks like they've been open since the 50's.  Everything about the food and service is great.  The waitress would remember your name if you're a regular, the bell the cook rings when food is up. Prices are very reasonable.  Go here at least once and try it."}
{"text":"The food here is awful. I ordered the chicken parmigiana and on top of the chicken was ground beef. I gave them a second chance because maybe some people like that (although I would never want to meat them). So I ordered the chicken fingers. I couldn't choke them down. The chicken was so shinny you could tell it was that crappy frozen stuff that is 60% plastic - chicken is not supposed to shine people. I'm done going to restaurants if this place gets 4 stars and this is the best I can expect."}
{"text":"Aha, this is the little breakfast place I was looking for the last couple of months. It has the greasy-spoon vibe down to a T, and as far as I can tell this is the only place for miles around where you can get a big plate of eggs and bacon, toast and coffee for under $10. If your brunch tastes run to \"give me a plate of eggs\" rather than \"benedict and mimosa\" this is your stop."}
{"text":"This place is DOPE. Great food, big portions, awesome staff, fast service. One of the best bruncheries in the city."}
{"text":"Ok, so I said I would review this place if I ever found it open, and I did!

Atmosphere:  Nice clean greasy spoon atmosphere, just the way I like it.

Service:  Smiling, friendly waitress, maybe too friendly...  floating in sickly-sweet perfume and more interested in flirting with the guy at the next table than serving me...

Food:  I had the fish and chips, a small portion of haddock (I think), which was somehow cooked hard and chewy.  Fries were frozen, whatever happened to real potatoes.  No coleslaw or veg on the plate, so not much visual appeal.  The amount of food barely covered half the plate, I was hungry when I left.

I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!

Coach House is a breath of fresh air if you're looking for breakfast in the central downtown area. There's no attitude, no needlessly fancy concoctions, and, likely, there's no lineup of hipsters doubling the amount of time it takes you to get some eggs and coffee.
The menu has all of the items you'd expect from a place with a grill and a frying pan. Burgers, grilled cheese, bacon and eggs, hot hamburger plates... it's all here, and it's very reasonably priced. The omelettes are $6-9 on a weekend morning, and they arrive in good time, and tastefully prepared. The service is professional, and coffee refills are never too far away. If you're looking for fancy or trendy, you're at the wrong place. If you're looking for reliable, reasonable, tasty, and satisfying, visit Coach House.
This might be the only time I ever give a greasy spoon 4 stars, simply because I can't imagine turning down the chance to eat here.

4 stars"}
{"text":"I went there based on Yelp reviews, and wasn't disappointed. Other reviews captured this place well. It doesn't look like much and feels very old, but the food is good, well above average."}
{"text":"If in the area of Wellesley St & Yonge, a great place for a cheap adequate but also a good breakfast. Typical old styled diner."}
{"text":"Although the great Brother's Restaurant further north on Yonge is gone, the Coach House still survives.

Vintage 'coach' decor complements this diner's reliability. The bacon and eggs breakfast special is perfect every time."}
{"text":"Such a good place to have brunch. Tiny but clean and yummy. The waiter and waitress there are really nice. It is definitely a great place to have fun time with friends here. I would recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"As good as it gets at dt yonge st. Don't even compare this to all the other breakfastcrap downtown. For the food/service/price, this really deserves a 5 star.

This is how to spot a good breakfast place:
If you walk by in the morning, and there are lots of old, retired folks in the place, GO EAT THERE."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch because of a quick Yelp search of the area which showed many positive reviews. The restaurant itself is simple and small. The servers were pleasant. The food wasn't anything special - but it wasn't bad. I guess it just didn't stand out at all. The prices were reasonable, although when it came time to pay, we found that we were charged $1.50 more on the final bill, and when we pointed this out, the woman corrected it by taking it down to $1 more. She seemed very disinterested in doing it too, so we didn't argue it, just left it at that...maybe that's how they make more money? The other patrons were...interesting to say the least. The manager on duty was kind enough to move a particular group into a separate room because of the smell that was radiating from their corner. It's downtown Toronto, so I guess you have to be prepared for all types of body odours and groups of people. Anyways, simple place for a simple meal if that's all you need."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday morning after finding this place near our hotel on Yelp.  It is exactly as described.  Basic breakfast fare served cheerfully and at a reasonable price.  The french toast was delicious.  The breakfast meats are interesting and tasty, but could have been warmer.  The restaurant is clean and the staff are very welcoming.  A good choice if you're in the area and just want breakfast."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that in stodgy old Totonto it would become almost impossible to find good, basic \"Canadian\" food like a western omelette or a club sandwich downtown. Fortunately, there is still the Coach House to satisfy my cravings. A traditional greasy spoon with good food at reasonable prices and friendly service. Breakfast and lunch only -- I think they close about 4:00. 7 589"}
{"text":"Other than the breakfast with bacon, the souvlaki is also really good and keep me and my coworkers going back. I had the banquet burger once, but I was a bit disappointed with the texture of the patty."}
{"text":"Very impressed by this little restaurant on Yonge Street. Almost at the intersection of Wellesley, this restaurant serves great food and great prices. The staff is friendly and the portions are large. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The Coach House is my go-to spot for breakfast in the area.  Whenever I arrive, the place is packed but you do not have to wait long for a table.

Service is quick and friendly.  Their menu has classic breakfast & diner items which are priced extremely reasonable.  You can't beat their delicious home fries.  They also make a decent cup of joe.

I highly recommend Coach House for a killer breakfast to start your day! (They also have some yummy lunch items as well)"}
{"text":"I come here frequently during the work week for lunch - it's cozy, cheap, and has good food. Service is usually quick and friendly. I almost always get the same thing (gluten problems) - a western omelette with feta - but I don't mind because YUM! My omelette runs me 11.95+tax (the cheese is extra), and comes with breakfast potatoes. It also comes with toast, but I skip it because gluten."}
{"text":"Typical diner place with usual egg and bacon type fixings. Not exactly as good as American greasy spoons (I lived in the us before and it doesn't compare). Nothing memorable or stellar but good prices! For better Canadian breakfast food I reckon you'd do better at Cora's or Insomnia for brunch."}
{"text":"We continued our long-running, weekly greasy spoon/diner tour this morning.  This place fit the bill.  The front room had a nice vibe, with classic old booths and a counter with stools.

The food was fine, nothing stood out, although the home fries were probably above average if not a tad greasy.

Cheap, cheerful, and worth a return visit."}
{"text":"it was a cute family own restaurant. The food is very standard diner food but the owners were warm and welcoming. Very solid home fries. Fairly reasonablh priced, will come back again!"}
{"text":"It's like Cheers but for breakfast. 

 We go in all the time on weekends and the staff is super friendly and very attentive.  The food is delicious, it's not pretentious, it's diner food, which is a nice reprieve from the snooty Yorkville area places not too far away.

The prices are amazing for what you get, we've brought a lot of friends to try it and everyone has gone back again.

If you drank all night or stayed up all night for Pride...this is the place you want to go the morning after."}
{"text":"Its frightening that this place actually has an average of 4 stars. Good for them but what does it say about the people that eat here. This place has been around longer than most of the condo's in the city.  This doesn't make it good, it just means somehow they just keep going. Deep fried bacon and overpriced is the best memory I have of my breakfast this morning with my friend James. The company was amazing as usual and sometime who you are with can compensate for terrible food, in this case it didn't help. $35 for breakfast for two in a greasy spoon just doesn't feel good."}
{"text":"A decent family run diner at Wellesley and Bloor. We`ve come a few times now. The place has been open since the 1960s and has that retro diner feel, complete with counter service, milkshakes and endless coffee.

The 3 eggs and peameal was $9. The big breakfast with sausage, bacon, ham, 3 eggs and waffle was around $12. (I`m a monster I know). The quality of the breakfast is hit and miss. The peameal this time tasted a bit funky, like they had done a burger right before and not cleaned the grill. Little things aside, its a decent place to come for brunch right downtonw."}
{"text":"3 Stars.

There is nothing fancy about this place. For a traditional diner it is great. Don't expect much because it doesn't have all the frills. If you come in expecting decent food for decent prices and an old school diner it will meet you expectations.

There isn't much to say about this place. It is nice to know there is a diner that is worth going to in this part of Toronto. For some reason it's hard to find good breakfast places, but here is one.

Thanks Coach House for a great breakfast. Don't know if I will be back as a regular, but if I am hungry, want breakfast, and am in the area I will be stopping by.

That's it!"}
{"text":"Odd overall experience. Service was friendly and fast but not necessarily \"good\"---items forgotten and then taken away before we were done (even though we said we weren't done!). Food orders were quite large and I enjoyed mine, although my dining companion's eggs were cold.  But the real rating from perhaps a 3 to a definite 2 were the disgusting, Trainspotting-level bathrooms. One was covered in unmentionables and the other stall has a door that not only didn't close, swung into the toilet so you couldn't even just leave it sort-of closed. So awful, just don't have bathrooms if you can't maintain them."}
{"text":"In a Toronto ever more overrun by an infectious \"brunch\" plague that  swallows twentysomehting and their wallets whole and a Yonge Street dotted with  nothing but nefarious looking watering holes and completely missable (at best) looking chain restaurants, I was thrilled to discover the tiny booth lined, wood panelled and straight up unstylish Coach House, with its dirt cheap, delicious and heart attack causing breakfasts (9 dollars for a full three egg/meat set with hashbrowns and waffle, anyone? LET'S SHORTEN OUR LIFESPANS), bizarre and typically local clientele, of which I am pleased to admit I probably am one of, and super friendly, omnipresent staff who will refill your coffee until you're pretty much shaking in the pleather. 

Like going commando with large, comfy sweatpant on, the Coach House is an \"experience\", but it's a nice, cozy and delicious one you'll want to repeat again and again. 

My boyfriend and I come in here often, typically hung over and ready for eggs, syrup and joy on weekend mornings, and can usually snag a spot (and coffee, and sometimes fresh squeezed juice) almost immediately. We consistently get heart stoppingly bad for you fare for less than 25 dollars all in with tip--- I particularly recommend the meat lovers omelette, the Coach House superbreakfast or some of the Greek specialties, although the menu is full of breakfast/lunch classics, and it's hard to go truly astray.


The only \"real\" downsides to be aware of here are
 1) food service, while always nice and welcoming, can sometimes be slow if the place looks busy. It's a bit unpredictable, but it helps you work up an appetite. 
2)The staff, probably justifiably, look at me like I've just landed from Mars whenever I get ambitious and ask for healthier substitutions. They never, ever get them right. 

Honestly, though, I didn't really want tomatoes instead of toast anyway."}
{"text":"food is always fresh and delicious. coach special and greek chicken salad are on the must-try list. they also have good burgers. i went their once a week and it is such a good time."}
{"text":"On many levels, breakfast can be a rather lazy experience. A mellow, gentle yet tasty experience.

Specially after a long, satisfying night out or perhaps if you are sporting the latest trend in hangover fashion or if you seriously just don't want to travel far for your food.  Either way, you want something nearby that is good and that is not bland like the Sunset Grill on Bloor.

Well imagine my surprise  when I found about the Coach House... plus the fact it is about a 12 minute walk from my place! Happy, happy, joy, joy!

Ah, seems I get excited about the small things in life but yeah, I digress, I was pleased to find a nearby breakfast place that serves a decent, well priced breakfast like at Johnny G's but closer.

The Coach House definitely rolls 'greasy spoon' old school, as there is something very late 70's, maybe early 80's about this place. Most likely the semi-retro, yellow and dark wood decour BUT... not in a hipster kind of way. Oh no, far from it, you are more likely to get a road dinner vibe than a Queen Street West one, which for me, is a good thing. If you see someone wearing 60's glasses here is because they are actually in their 60's and not just being ironic. Damn hipsters. ;-)

The meals come out hot and with no BS: Eggs, meat, bread, coffee...  no superfluous fancy names or attitude. Just good portions and a tasty breakfast to boot. Service is good, attentive and the prices are fair. 

Really, this place is a small hidden gem and when I mean hidden, I mean it. None of my friends knew about this place --that is, until I told them. 

Heck, I have over the years walked by the Coach House countless times and for some reason, I always kept thinking the place to be a bit sketchy and so I stayed away... oh, was I wrong. Not sketchy at all.  

So if you are in the hood of if you are looking for a great downtown breakfast joint to try, definitely give the Coach House a try."}
{"text":"Some people consider this a greasy spoon type of place. I don't! I think their food is tasty and fresh and fairly priced. They have the best fresh squeezed OJ in the city!!! The staff are always nice and friendly. My friends and I usually end up in the back room where we can be silly and nobody cares! ha!"}
{"text":"Coach House gets a rare 5 stars from me because it's always dependable.

In a neighbourhood where food isn't always cheap, the Coach House is always reliable for breakfast or lunch.  We've come here a few times - service is always friendly and fast, food is great (it IS a diner) and the prices are cheap.

Never had a problem here and will continue to make this a priority whenever I feel like having a cheap, local brunch."}
{"text":"I was walking around Downtown Toronto when I came across Coach House.  The lure of an all-day breakfast was enough to get me inside where the interior tells the story of a place that has seen better days but still has plenty to offer its patrons.  The faux brick walls have been painted over and the decor is dated but the staff have done a great job maintaining the place as it was clean and well-kept when I was there.  

I enjoyed my breakfast, the eggs were cooked as ordered. However, the potatoes did not look appealing at all. The bacon and sausages were tasty but they were a touch over cooked as well.  I was the first person to enter the restaurant and I wound up getting the bottom of the coffee pot with my breakfast.  Overall, I enjoyed my breakfast, but it would have been better had my coffee been fresh and those potatoes been left in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I have walked by this place so many times, but I've never seen it open. When I found it mentioned on a BlogTO article about cheap brunch places in Toronto, I knew I had to try it.

The place has a Mediterranean vibe to it, I suspect because the family that runs the place is Greek. The food is diner style and seems like a place where a lot of regulars get their breakfast. 

I'm so glad I found this place. The food is cheap but the quality did not suffer. The food was delicious. I ordered the coach house breakfast, and immediately fell in love with their house fries. They also kept filling up my coffee! I couldn't recommend the place more and I could definitely see myself becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"Good place for a no-nonsense breakfast/brunch.
Definitely a hole-in-the-wall. There is a back room with more seating space. The group bill wasn't separated for us, and when we tried to help the cashier separate our bills, she was not happy. Not happy that we were creating more work for her, and not happy that we were trying to help her by giving her the already calculated sums.
Definitely don't order the chopped steak meal. I forget what it's called but it was like eating a cut up hamburger. The rest of the food was good though and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"Finally, I've found a place close to work and can just sit and read my paper over a corned beef sandwich. No sushi, no organic salads, no chain-type burgers, no kids. 

The corned beef was just the right kind of dry and the rye was fresh. A perfect sandwich. I can't wait to stop in for breakfast one morning."}
{"text":"Like my check in said, it been a long time coming for me to hit this spot. Even thou my profile says I joined in July of 14, I really didnt start my review till the beggining of 2015, so 200 or so reviews in span of one year, This place has been on my bookmark list for the longest time around the early days. One of people who's reviews I started to follow was Itanni's. The Coach house at the time was a recent review and if you check her review she review it back around the end of 2014 (last time) so long time. So now with that intro, Seeing my long intro, you wonder why such a place get a meh rating

I had a few issue to redirect and service was one of them. hence why this probably one of few place where I didnt tip. There were two people I dealt with an older lady with short brown hair and younger blonde. This is more direct to older lady, who's probably an owner or manager since it seem she lack basic serve. She was the one that took my order and seem she was just trying to rush it and get out of there, she started to walk away before I was done. I order the coach super breakfast, if I hadnt said anything as she walk away she would brough me brown toast without asking as well meal had an option of pancake instead of home fries, guess it good I didnt want pancakes, she didnt even ask. Had I wanted pancake I would raise an issue when the server came back. Not only that, she brought the bill even before I finished eat, granted I was almost done but that made me feel like it was a sign to get out. She was rushing me out the door like she rushed taking my order and what is with her hand written reciept, I couldnt read it, there was 2 buck charge I didnt understand. The blonde explain it was coffee when I was paying which I had no issue with, but if you are going to give out hand written receipt, make them more clear. I should add, I had to flag down the server for more coffee and they didnt check on me till the end. This is why service fails her for me and they got no tip from me

Service 1/5- (Blonde was alteast friendy, polite, the older women get a zero from me )


Food

Now this food, The Coach Super Breakfast- let me tell this, its far from super, the bacon was chewy not crispy, the ham was hard to cut and had rubber like feel to it, and sausage was slighly burnt, so right there it was bad. Where they fail with the side, the home fries were decent, this is usually my grip with most breakfast places but not here, the eggs I felt were a bit more cook then should been for over easy and I wasnt 100% if I had 2 or 3 eggs or two eggs were together since i only broke two eggs to dip my toast but it was 3 egg meal. It could be two eggs became one and I didnt notice so I wont knock them for that but honestly it wasnt that good as an overall meal, something like that should be filling but im semi hungry

Food get a 2/5 due home fries being good and eggs were decent, everything else was disappointing

Hence why this place get a 2/5.  It doesnt get 1 because I reserve that for totally terrible but the food wasnt all bad and the blonde's service was okay.

I probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Visited today with family for breakfast. Sat in the inside cozy room which was dated but clean and comfortable. The rest of the restaurant is similarly decorated. But I liked it as it was frozen in a gone by era. 

We had a veggie omelet, a spinach feta omelet, plain scrambled eggs and a waffle between the four of us. With coffees, milks and some extras we spent $60 taxes and tips included. 

The food was delicious. The home fries were amazing. Both the omelets were packed with flavours and veggies and cheeses there were no skimping. The waffle was it was supposed to be crisp on the outside and soft inside. 

The service was good. The coffee could have been a bit stronger. 

Will visit again if is in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The BEST diner in the city - hands down ! 

The breakfasts are down home good. Eggs, pancakes, French toast, omelettes and waffle goodness with bacon, sausage, home fries and the best hangover breakfast close to home. 

The burgers, fish & chips (shame they don't make their own tarter sauce), club sandwiches and even the liver & onions are freshly cooked and just absolutely wonderful. They do have specials and they are yummy !! The French fries taste like French Fries. Wonderful cut potatoes with no skin, cooked just perfectly !! 

There are no fancy coffees - coffee here is good and so is the tea 

Some would call the Coach House a \"greasy spoon\" and others would call it \"a diner\" - there is no fancy sauces or fusion food here  ! Just good food, great service where they actually write down what you want and get it right every time. 

No fancy plates, just great old art on wood walls, old fashion written bills and you can hear the bell the cook taps when an orders up !! Classic ! 

The place it packed - all the time and no wonder - it's great ! You gotta go."}
{"text":"I had the chicken souvlaki with rice, potatoes and Greek salad. I was impressed with the size of the chicken souvlaki skewer. Overall I was very satisfied. I've had breakfast here as well and their home fries are awesome."}
{"text":"Simply old fashioned old school breakfast place, as other yelpers mentioned, this is a ma and pa joint, very traditional, there is a hidden dinning room at the back, so don't think it's full if the front is all filled.

Price for food is decent, the portion is good for most hungry man or woman, there are a good selections of food from light breakfast to full lunch on the menu.

I ordered the super breakfast as its my first time here, 3 bacon, 3 eggs ham and 2 sausage with a choice of fries/pancake/French toast? I opted for pancakes as it is recommended by many yelpers, and it was definitely as good people say, the pancake although doesn't look that great, but it taste AWESOME!  It is definitely a must try if it's your first time here, I will definitely come back again, and try their other items on the menu.

If u happens to be in the area give this classic joint a try, you will not regret."}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't have come here if it wasn't for a friend's recommendation. The sign outside makes it seem like a place that serves bad food but once you're inside, you realize the place is quite big, clean and bright.

We had the feta omelette with home fries and the super breakfast with waffle along with tea and coffee. The omelette had a really nice texture, it reminded me of my mom's omelettes. Bacon was crispy but not burnt. I feel like the super breakfast should've come with toast for the eggs but it didn't. The waffle wasn't crispy enough on the outside for my taste but it had a lovely texture inside. The waitress forgot our toast so we had to wait for a bit but overall, service was good.

Definitely a good value if you're looking for an inexpensive good breakfast!"}
{"text":"About 2 weeks ago, I went downtown to have breakfast at a restaurant I had read about, but I couldn't find it (as I had mis-read the map on Yelp). Since I was near to Wellesley, I decided to try the Coach House Restaurant, which I have known about for awhile but never managed to visit. It was a pleasant surprise!

It's very much an old-fashioned diner, looking like it hasn't changed in decades; they even have a display of old stubby beer bottles on one of the shelves. But for me this is okay, as I like old-fashioned diners, and most importantly the food and service and prices were all good. The restaurant was pretty full when I arrived, although I later heard that they have another dining room in the back, but the service was fast and friendly anyway. Many of the customers were probably regulars, as the servers seemed to know what many of them wanted.

I was hungry by the time I arrived, so I had the chopped steak and eggs breakfast. The chopped steak was very good, and along with three eggs and home fries and toast, it was a very filling meal. With coffee, the bill was $17 and well worth it. So last week, I decided to return while I was downtown again. This time I had a double meat omelette (ham and sausage), also with home fries and toast and coffee for $14. Again a very good and filling meal, and I really enjoyed the home fries. Other choices include pancakes and waffles, a variety of sandwiches and burgers, souvlaki and a few diner plates like pasta or veal. Overall, nothing fancy, but good food and service for a good price. Definitely a place that I will return again, maybe for lunch next time (but note that they close at 4pm everyday)."}
{"text":"Traditional place. Old space but very good food and service. I like the atmosphere a lot. Looks like a family business, very nice people. The menu is simple and delicious."}
{"text":"Cheap dirty spoon breakfast styles.
Nothing remarkable, but for the price and being located where it is, it's worth a stop if looking for a standard eggs/meat/potatoe/toast breakfast on a budget."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a higher rating but there were some mishaps.  The food was way too salty (had at least three cups of water and more after leaving) and the busy staff couldnt handle the morning weekend crowd.

Food: 3/5, it was really tasty but most likely due to the salt content as while it was good at the moment, it wasn't great after. The fresh squeezed juice is also \"meh\" too much pulp. 

Ambience: 3/5, cool old diner feel and great for conversations. The seating could however be a bit tight for tall people.

Service: 2/5, they messed up with our order and not much attention; this could be fixed with perhaps few more waiters or less of them just looking down. And you have to pay up in front.  Is this a thing now downtown where they don't serve you up to payment?  Lol.

Price: 4/5, relatively cheap at around $15 per person"}
{"text":"Coach House is a throwback to a time when breakfast was breakfast and not \"brunch,\" when men were men, and eggs were not drowned in hollandaise and garnished with wussy microgreens. No, sirree. Coach House is where you get your eggs fried, your pork sausage greasy, and your toast white. (Yes, they offer \"brown\" bread, but what are you, some kind of pinko commie bastard?). This is a breakfast for people who are not scared of cholesterol. 

The people that work there are very friendly, and food comes out quickly. I've been numerous times, and will continue to go for as long as Coach House remains the basic, unassuming place it always has been."}
{"text":"On sat morning we were debating where to have brunch. I still insisted making coffee at home first before going out.. some of the restaurant coffees are very questionable and I didnt want to take a chance.

So we found this cute little diner on yonge/ wellesley

Not too many selections on the menu, seems very basic stuff. I was mildly disappointed until the server brought a nice plate of souvlaki chicken plate to the patron next to me. souvlaki for breakfast.... why not? 

oh wow was i glad i did! it was such good tender flavorful, slightly charred, perfect cooked chicken with a generous greek salad along with fresh fries. mm-mm!

huddy's plate looked ok. think it was the breakfast with three eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, with waffles. i took a few bites, think i liked my soulaki wayyy better tho!

definitely will return. i was talking to the nice lady at the cash. This place has been here for 65 years. that's just so amazing! the diners on yonge go in and out of business all the time and I'm just so very impressed it's been here that long! awesome place, still going strong :) I'm a fan!

p.s. i heard coffee was also good. next time i wont pre-make coffee at home."}
{"text":"Ok breakfast house.

Went in, sat myself, and ordered a big breakfast item from them.  Came with eggs, saussage, bacon, potatos, and toast with jam.

Everything was pretty good, except for the potatoes, which seemed to have been the final batch they made before they switched to lunch orders.  They were soggy, and the only thing remotely crispy were the burnt parts.

Service was friendly enough, I'll probably come back to try a lunch item.  But wont' be coming back for their all day breakfast unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great prices. It was an awesome place to wander into for breakfast."}
{"text":"On the recommendation of our AirBnB host, we had a delightful diner breakfast at the Coach House while visiting Toronto.  

You get a huge plate of food -- I had sausage, home fries, and eggs, and my guy had French toast -- for under $10.  It's not especially fancy or gourmet, but it fills you up and hits the spot.  Coffee is decent, and your cup is continually refilled.  Service is friendly and efficient.  

I'm from NJ, where we take our diners (and our diner breakfasts) seriously.  Coach House passes muster with me!"}
{"text":"Not bad or the price and service...love the home fries easy quick.  Short walk from my place."}
{"text":"This was a good spot for breakfast.  Serving items with a bit of Mediterranean flair, I enjoyed our meal here.  They had plenty of items on their menu and we opted for an omelet we sort of made up: eggs with beef/lamb and feta cheese - it turned out very well and was a nice, exotic twist on a typical omelet.  The freshly squeezed orange juice also hit the spot.

The service was very good and friendly."}
{"text":"Small, family owned and run diner with a greasy/oily breakfast. Their breakfast is quite sloppily done, nothing to be impressed by, it's very diner-style with all the oil and fat that accompanies it. My eggs were severely undercooked and the service was rather lacking and absent. Staff seemed to hurry you out even though it wasn't even full. Decor was diner-style, but quite dirty and falling apart. Their food is cheap, but you're better off getting breakfast or diner food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. The waffle was really big and they didn't have standard toast with every option, it had to be a separately paid side. Very heavy protein for a brunch, but it was good!

Really unique old school decor and atmosphere. Really busy with friendly, but very busy servers, so they weren't that attentive and took a long time to deliver the food."}
{"text":"Very \"cozy\" small but size never matters what is important is the quality of food wich is amazing very clean and very home style.Do come to this place !!! Wished I've  I knew bout this place in beginning of our trip enjoy !"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this restaurant. I was excited to try it after reading all these positive Yelp reviews but I left pretty unhappy. Not only was the service slow (like beyond the level of slowness you would allow a relaxed diner to have), but our waiter never checked on us once to see if we needed anything. I ordered the hot beef sandwich and I found the gravy it was smothered in tasted way too salty. Also my fries tasted like they were from frozen. It was a big let down. At the end of our meal, our server (which I had to flag down) also forgot the takeout box I requested. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Coach House is so warm and friendly, a true blast from the past. I am a huge fan of retro diners, and Coach House is retro in the absolute best way with cute little booth seats and counter seating!! The counter and wait staff is always so friendly and funny, and they are always happy to make small talk with you. The food is on point and the coffee is delicious. A lovely diner!!"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall diner with good food and good service. Ordered the Peameal and eggs and was satisfied with the quality and portion size. 

Prices were also very reasonable for a downtown diner."}
{"text":"Solid greasy-spoon type place, but there are better options in the area (The Senator, for one).  Family that runs the place is very sweet - we felt very cared for.  No complaints about the food or service, but in a week of eating some awesome food on holiday in Toronto, this place didn't stick out at all."}
{"text":"Great little place for a real diner breakfast. Super nice staff. Great prices. We're so happy having this little gem in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Cozy little diner. Friendly waitress.

Prices were decent, food good. Was full when finished. 

Had orange juice, which I personally didn't care for, as it was freshly squeezed. Way to much pulp for me. But that's just a personal preference. 

I had meat lovers omelette with cheese. Was good. 

G/F had Veggy omelette and she enjoyed it as well. 

Home fries are not what I consider home fries, but more sliced potatoes possibly deep fried. Instead of potatoes cubed. 

All and all I would return."}
{"text":"The only remaining diner of its kind on Yonge Street.  60 years !  The owners are adorable and still there most days.  Breakfast is incredible, clientele is mixed - regulars go there for years and are greeted with warmth and familiarity.  Hurry and go before a developer buys the land."}
{"text":"I must have passed the Coach House a hundred times in the course of my various Toronto vacations, but I never really saw it until last week, when I noticed the \"all day breakfast\" signs. Well, I didn't need an \"all day\" breakfast, but I did decide to try it out one morning.

It's an old-fashioned diner of the sort that's disappearing from downtown Toronto, what with all the condominium development. When I looked in the window, the clientele seemed decidedly \"older\" -- not tourists, but local \"regulars,\" which is always a good sign. There wasn't a small booth available for me, so I was led to the \"dining room\" in the rear of the restaurant. I was worried I'd be neglected back there, but no fear: a waitress came fairly quickly to take my order, and checked in on me regularly.

My spinach-and-feta omelet was excellent. The accompanying potatoes were like a good version of American homefries -- firmly sliced, rather than chopped and overcooked, and savory -- and, as at most Canadian establishments, multigrain toast is available.

I hope this places survives for a bit: now that I've found it, I want to come back!"}
{"text":"Great deal for breakfast in the downtown core! 

I had the big breakfast I cant remember the exact name but it has eggs,bacon, sausage,ham, breakfast potatoes and toast. 

My friend had the chicken souvlaki

My breakfast was great and the price was good as well. About $10 for all that food. 

My friend said her chicken souvlaki was good and shes greek so i think shes a pretty good judge.

the inside is old fashion like something out of the 80s and the staff is super friendly! This is a great homestyle breakfast place in the city id recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Delicious, inexpensive and fast! All things that equal a great hangover joint! 
When visiting Toronto, and in turn some family, we were looking for a Sunday brunch spot and my brother (a loyal coach fan) suggested we try here. Although packed with Sunday brunchers, we were seated immediately in the back area for extra seating. One thing I personally like in a greasy spoon, hangover spot is fast, but not too fussy, service! They were attentive but left us alone to eat and enjoy.
The food was delicious and simple but great value! Nothing too fancy but that was not what we were looking for and they delivered more than expected! Keep up the awesome work and if you are in the neighborhood I highly suggest it!"}
{"text":"I have tried to find a simple diner in the downtown area for a while now.  Thankfully when I moved into the area I was able to find the coach house through Yelp. 

I have had the gyro and the big breakfast here. Really great for the price, not a place you are going to get a fancy brunch but great for a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and a simple but tasty breakfast.

Definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"My debit card was not working and my total was $7.90. I only had $5 cash and rather than cancel my takeout order, they kept saying, \"don't worry! It's ok.\" And let me pay $5. They could have pointed me to the nearest bank machine, but were happy to let me have my meal for $5. Excellent service! And my breakfast was delicious."}
{"text":"As greasy a spoon as you're likely to find in Hogtown, the Coach House is an institution in the way worn out record shops, strip clubs and historical crime scenes are. 

Ducking in from a grimy section of Yonge street, diners are greeted by wobbly stools, cracked pleather booths packed too close for comfort, and a loose-shirted older gentleman sweating behind the counter. 

Service is insulting in the best diner fashion. Coffee arrives swiftly, though, and is refilled without asking. It won't win any awards, but it's good enough to chase a hangover. 

Breakfast orders also arrive promptly. 

Over-easy eggs are perfectly cooked, but the yolks have burst somewhere in transit, spoiling a bit of the fun. A veggie omelette fares better (and likely healthier), but it's eggs are cooked to dryness; the exterior just past caramelized. I never trust omelettes or scrambled eggs in places like this; I imagine someone opening a carton of pasteurized liquid egg-like substance; I like to see what I'm getting. 

Sausages are properly greasy and just-charred. 

A mound of home-fried potatoes could have used a few more minutes on the griddle, but then I like my potatoes extra-mushy. 

Drowned in tabasco (no ketchup for me), it's just what i crave. 

Toast options are appropriately white-or-brown industrial sandwich loaf. 

I wouldn't take a business meeting here, unless I did something illegal. I wouldn't bring my wife-she deserves better, cleaner and less scary. But when I want to indulge the occasional Jack Reacher novel fantasy, the Coach House is home."}
{"text":"This place is great.  It's old school looking inside.  Breakfast is like you'd make at home.  SUPER cheap.  

It's fast and good.  What more could you want."}
{"text":"Got the French Toast which was mediocre. The milkshake that I ordered tasted very syrupy and frothy and didn't really taste of milk or ice cream. Service was friendly but a bit inattentive."}
{"text":"I think this place has been at this location for many years, and yet I have never noticed it until recently.  This is a little bit embarrassing considering I have walked past this place probably 1000 times.

I like this place.  It has a very old school classic diner feel to it and is conveniently located at Yonge and Wellesley.  The food is very tasty/greasy and really friendly service.  Big, filling portions for a good price. I like it."}
{"text":"This is a hands down amazing hangover breakfast/brunch spot at a mom and pop diner. We got there around noon for their all day breakfast special going on. As we were starving, we got the superclass which can with bacon, ham, sausage, a pancake, three eggs with toast and jam for $11.Breakfast doesn't include coffee so we had to order that on too drink. It's bottomless which but it's hard getting a refill since it can get busy in there. Definitely worth a comeback but would sit in the front room as its easier to get better service."}
{"text":"Yes I have been here and what a little old school gem! Well priced and quick service. If you are looking to just sit, read the paper and have bacon and eggs this is the place to go. Not fancy."}
{"text":"Wicked breakfast,  i loved coming to this place for my breakfast.
It has a great old school feel dinner, small booths and a eating counter. The service is fast and food is what it is. Quick simple breakfast! The coffe and freshed pressed orange juice is nice.

I like it that is un assuming and that the staff is friendly.

Definately worth returning to and my favourite hangout!"}
{"text":"Un VRAI bon vieux \"dinner\" à l'américaine/la canadienne! Dès qu'on y entre, on est transporté dans les années 60-70. On a rapidement l'impression que la déco n'a pas changée depuis son ouverture, mais c'est ce qui fait le charme de la place. On y trouve tous les repas les plus courants comme deux-oeufs-bacon, des gaufres, du pain doré et des crêpes pour le déjeuner. La gaufre que mon chum a dévoré, et que j'ai goûté avant sa disparition rapide, était l'une des meilleures que j'ai mangé depuis un bon bout. Mes oeufs étaient très bien et les patates super bonnes mais quand même ordinaire comme repas. C'est vraiment l'ambiance du resto que j'ai apprécié le plus."}
{"text":"This small husband and wife owned diner is a great breakfast spot. The front of house service from the wife is full of cheer and a home spirit. The kitchen service is quick and the husband is a great cook. 
The food is good and the portions generous. I got the veggie omelette which was well stuffed with veg and came with toast and hash browns. 
Go up to the register to pay when done."}
{"text":"Came to this place on a Thursday morning and I have to say the place has a cozy look to it.  I ordered the steak breakfast and it was delicious.  The steak was seasoned well and the home fries were nice and crispy.  I payed almost 16 dollars for my meal, including tip; so price wise it is decent but they do have specials under 10 dollars.  Unfortunately the service was subpar because one of waitresses was late for work, so the chef had to serve me and I was not given condiments for my steak breakfast or any coffee refills.  Would I come back?  Yes!  Coach house has a cozy look and delicious food.  It is near my work and I would eat at Coach House, rather than lining up at McDonald's for an egg Mcmuffin. Hopefully the service improves the next time I stop by."}
{"text":"We were seated in another room right away and might have had one or two other tables filled in the room, and so this made us feel kind of forgotten. My dad and I split and omelet which seemed actually a little overcooked. The food was ok, but not very memorable. We didn't get any refills on our coffee, but the prices were reasonable. Service was pretty slow even though it didn't seem that busy to me. I'm not sure if it was an off morning or what, doesn't look like the pics I am seeing here on Yelp."}
{"text":"Food is ok, a little greasy but overall ok.
I like the order the chicken souvlaki.

I give only 3 star because the service is bad. Every time I go there I will be standing there with no one coming o greet me or tell me where to sit. Then when I want to put an order, I always have to call the waiter/owner multiple times."}
{"text":"Just visited the Coach House.
It's quaint, small, friendly staff, and it's old fashioned classic diner food. My friend had the regular brunch, eggs over easy, toast, bacon, and scallop looking potatoes.

I didn't taste it, but it seems like the meal was a good choice, minus those random potatoes.

I had the Grilled Cheese. Perfect. Kraft Singles on white bread, seemed like pan grilled.. and nothing on the plate but that sandwich.

Delicious!
