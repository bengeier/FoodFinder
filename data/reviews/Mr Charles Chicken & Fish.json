{"text":"Best fried chicken in town and best gizzards too. Sorry Price's! We used to live close but now actually make a special trip now and then just to get some."}
{"text":"Damn good food for the soulful pescaterian! Bojangles/JJ's/Showmars are def inferior in terms of customer service, portions, as well as flavor. Im ashamed that Im just trying this place out. Ill be back!"}
{"text":"Yeah Buddy, this is what I've been looking for.  Fried Perch, Whiting and shrimp (among other fish and chicken) It was all good."}
{"text":"Yessss sir! The chicken gizzards are everything !! I've never tried anything else but I've heard only good things! Good food for a Great price"}
{"text":"Another review that I hate to write. I was so excited about finally ordering from here. I was so hungry & had a taste for everything unhealthy. I ordered the fried fish & fried chicken special, fantail shrimp, & had the Mac & cheese & green beans as sides.
The staff was super friendly but alas, not a single napkin in the bag. I HATE that. 
The fried shrimp tasted like every other fast food restaurant. It was overly battered and lacked a real home cooking taste. The same goes for the fried chicken. It could've been fried chicken from anywhere.
The fish was good but again there was way too much batter. It was nothing special. The mac & cheese was okay. The green beans were decent. I spent about $15 on that meal & ended up giving most of it away. Such a shame, I really wanted to like this place"}
{"text":"With a name like Mr. Charles Chicken, I HAD to try it!  We ordered a 2 piece dark meat with a side of fried okra, perfect for an early lunch.  Crispy, seasoned chicken, fried perfectly.  Plenty of side items to choose from and hand made mini sweet potato pies. The man at the counter also told us homemade cupcakes on Friday!  No seating, carry out only. Great for large orders too!!!"}
{"text":"If I hadn't found this place on Yelp, I NEVER would've found it. The parking situation is not that convenient, but once you get passed that, I really liked this place. NO! You will not eat there. It's standing room only, and once you get about 8 people in there, you may not make it in the door. Once inside, the people who work there are extremely nice...just very pleasant. That alone makes me want to go back. The food is seasoned well and I enjoyed it. I ordered the whiting dinner with collard greens and the broccoli casserole. WARNING: the broccoli dish has rice in it. Yes, I've heard of broccoli casserole before but I hadn't had it in forever and forgot about that. (I'm trying to cut carbs, so...yea.) Anyway, everything really was delicious and the greens were very well seasoned. I could eat a plate of those by themselves. I also ordered the 4 wing dinner. I must admit, the wings are a little on the small side, maybe that's a good thing, at least you know they haven't been pumped with steroids or some other hormones that may cause health issues. Anyway, they were also seasoned well and crispy. I say, give this place a try if you haven't, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for a good fish sandwich and I especially love going to places with history and longevity in the business.  Mr Charles has been around since the 80's, is a father/son business and are known for their chicken poboy( 3 piece, potato wedges and a roll).  I called in my order of chicken and fish and arrived just before closing.  I conversed with the father who rang me up and he couldn't believe I had never been there before since I've lived in Charlotte a while.  He was such a nice guy and reminded me of home when he asked for my last name to ensure he didn't know any of my 'folks'.......too funny.  I wasn't in love with how the fish and chicken was seasoned, the potato wedges were actually seasoned better, but I do plan to return for what I hear is a pretty mean turkey burger."}
{"text":"We had them cater our food for a high school graduation party--The food was FABULOUS!!!!  The fried fish was crispy and seasoned perfectly.  The baked & fried chicken was fresh, tender & juicy and the Mac n cheese & green beans tasted like your grandma's!  We also had their yellow rice that was fluffy and tasty. We had other sides but these were the hit makers!  We will definitely return. All of our \"out of town\" guests said they'll put the number in their phones to visit at their next trip to the Queen City!!  I passed this place hundreds of times but never stopped. We're so glad we had them cater for us. The owner is a very nice and pleasant gentleman. They even loaded up our car with curb service for all the food. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"The chicken is great has a good flavor! The Mac and Cheese was hot and fresh had cheese unlike most soul foods around town!"}
{"text":"Ok, just 4 years behind Tonya's visit getting here, but still an excellent recommendation!  Friendly people, fantastic fried chicken!  Will try the seafood next time!  Wish there was a dining room, but hey, you go to where the food is good!"}
{"text":"Had the wings and Mom had 2 pieces fried chicken.
Delicious . Finally a restaurant with great food close to home."}
{"text":"Tried this spot today based coworkers feedback. Yep! It's on point! I had the 2 piece dinner with Mac n cheese and yams. Half now half later."}
{"text":"Frying chicken and shrimp and fish in the same grease is cheap and disgusting. If you don't mind it then maybe you will enjoy it. I was certainly not a fan. I'd rather pay more and get more than pay less and get a mess"}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday. I'm pleasantly surprised and will definitely be back on a normal basis as long as their service level and food remains this good. This place is close to my office. I had a burger and some sides; it was all delicious. Prices weren't bad at all. The service was great.. no shenanigans."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken & potato wedges in Charlotte! I will say, I usually go during the week and get absolutely amazing wedges that are crispy on the outside and just right on the inside, with a perfect plethora of seasonings that has a touch of celery. Delicious! Today wasn't one of those days...obviously I need to go when Mr.Will is there to ensure consistency. 

Signed, fat girl on the low!"}
{"text":"My favorite chicken spot.  I would recommend calling a head.  Takes a minute to deep fry delicious chicken. On the one day a month with I need a fix, this is where you will find me.  They marinate their chicken overnight and even feed the less fortunate on Christmas Day."}
{"text":"In two words: Worth it. This small family owned shop had one of the best burgers I've had in ages. Had the Mr. Charles special which came with onions, chili, slaw (all homemade) and a double beef patty which was made in house. Cooked to perfection, it nearly melted in my mouth. Also came with a very generous helping of potato wedges. 

So next time you're in the mood for a GREAT burger and are wondering if it's worth venturing out into the experience that Beatties Ford road can be let me remind you that it is 100% worth it."}
{"text":"OMG you have got to go here!! They make the best fish sandwiches, Mac -n-Cheese and potato salad. They have so many ohter options it's crazy and the nicest people I know! Can't keep me away from here."}
{"text":"The hype over this chicken is real, but on a drunk night when nothing else is open... this chicken is good. Now the best chicken in Charlotte lol don't believe the hype .  The potato wedges are good, and you'll always get a show when u go."}
{"text":"I've seen this place a thousand times on the way to get my hair fixed, and last Saturday I decided to stop by and see what it was all about.  It was crowded which is sometimes a good sign, it's a small place right on the corner of Stateville Ave right beside a barbershop.  So I went in and of course it smelled amazing fried, fried and more fried.  I got me a white meat chicken box it came with potato wedges, a roll and baked beans with a breast and wing.  I also got lemonade to drink, it took sometime but it was well worth it, it was the best fried chicken on the bone I've had in sometime.  The beans were really good, my little girl of course enjoyed the potato wedges but she enjoyed the rest as well.  I taught it was amazing, I wish it was one near my house.  But I will make it a routine stop after I get my hair fixed from now on out, yall should try it if you not on a calorie counting, fearing fried food kind of trip then you will enjoy it, they also have many different types of fish."}
{"text":"Mr. Charles just opened up a new location by 485 and it is beautiful the Decour of the TVs everything is so beautiful and clean the food is the same as the other Mr. Charles on Statesville but it's just a really really nice place I had a fish sandwich today I had ribs last week everything is phenomenal Mike and his father have done a phenomenal job I will visit this place every day"}
{"text":"Around the way spot, order your food and get out, you'll see people eating in their cars. They close at 6 sharp so don't wait until the last minute when u want them for dinner. Two piece dark is my go to with Mac and cheese, candied yams and an extra side of potato salad. I never have leftovers. My daughters fight over the fried okra. I've also had a pork chop sandwich like no other perfectly seasoned and not busy just meat, bread, lettuce and tomato. We eat here at least once a week if I checked in all the time well they'd offer me a job."}
{"text":"WHAT!!!!!!!!! COME get you some! I love me a po boy and wedges. Before we could make it to the car the whole family had empty containers. We went back for seconds. The price is right and you will double back yourself."}
{"text":"Friendly staff,  reasonable prices and great food!  It really doesn't get any better than that.  I keep saying I'm going to try the burgers I hear so much about but man if I can't resist the fried fish everytime."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely great! Best chicken and fish dinners we have ever had. Every employee greeted us and made sure we were welcome. The owner even came out sat and talk with us while we waited for our order. We will make this a main stay every time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Delish!!! Saturday fried chicken, mac n cheese w/greens. Best buy in Charlotte. Call ahead and save time on the wait. Also good for a quick snack - wings and wedges (po'boy) or fish and wedges."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch while in Charlotte on business.   Shrimp and Chicken were amazing!  The staff were very friendly and courteous, and all of the patrons were very friendly too.  It was a welcoming place with delicious food.  Great pick!"}
{"text":"Wanted to add some extra compliments! We recently had them cater an 80 person lunch and after they did our tailgate a few months back, people were literally in line 20+ minutes before they arrived to get their hands back on Mr. Charles food! They did a great job of getting all of the food here and on time. Everyone is looking forward to the next time we have them come!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall in appearance but top notch in food quality! Everything is amazing. My personal fav is the chicken livers. Those fried Green beans are a show stopper! This is the ultimately \"cheat day\" treat, not for the super health conscious. You can smell the cholesterol at the door, and it smells delicious."}
{"text":"I live quite a distance away from here but found myself running errands in the area around lunch time mid week a few times so I stopped by. They are really nice people and I love the family feel. They make u feel like u are at home. My favorites the shrimp burger, turkey burger and okra. Went one evening close to closing time and small details were missing like it was rushed but that's to be expected sometimes at closing time. I will definitely be back and can't wait to bring my family from up north in for a visit."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in town! Way better than the overrated chicken place in south end! Must try!!!"}
{"text":"This review is actually for their new location off of 4-85. I've read previous reviews for their other location and decided to give the new location a try. I must say everything was fresh. However, my food lacked flavor. Their was a hint of flavor in everything but nothing that was appealing to my palate. The macaroni and cheese could have used just a little bit more cheese and less grease. The potato wedges are huge and they were pretty tasteful. The flounder was bland. Quite a disappointment. The establishment itself is very nice and cozy inside. I will give them 4.5 stars for their decor.  However I did not dine in. I plan to revisit in the near future to determine if this was just an off day for them. 
I did meet one of their managers (forgot his name) but he was very nice and welcoming. That goes a long way in this business. Thank you for such great customer service."}
{"text":"Great restaurant went here twice in one week.  Fish and chicken with mac and cheese, Yams, potato salad."}
