{"text":"Smokeless Joe gets 5 stars for being one of the greatest concept restaurants I've been in...ever.  I completely understand and accept that my sense of Smokeless Joe's greatness is directly attached to my own love (LOVE) of a good pot of mussels.  Their African Peanut soup is also great, which makes me assume that the other stews and soups are too.  Additionally, I find the beer list here suits my taste better than any other I've found in Toronto so far, and the fact that the beeristas are willing (and required) to leave their bar fortress and go to the fridge at the back of the store makes me feel grossly indulgent asking for some of their bottled speciailties.  My one request for these guys is to find a way to add some pommes frites to the menu...but I'll be back weekly regardless."}
{"text":"Place is \"cozy\" and busy.  It's a bit loud on the main floor. I'd check out the second floor if you want a quieter experience.  Servers were nice but once it got busy, my drinks stopped getting filled.  Had crab cakes for $11, which came with 2 small crab cakes.  They were really good, but I was expecting a little more for $11.  Muscles were $16 a plate, tasty and quite big.  Added one glass of white wine, which was cold and crisp, and bill gave to $57.  I left feeling a little hungry, however, my date was stuffed.  It's a bit pricey, I think the quality may be there but the quantity is lacking."}
{"text":"great place, and i don't even drink beer.  snug and charming, with lovely staff."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful evening here.  Environment, service, quality, MUSSELS!  Thanks."}
{"text":"Pretty cool little place.  No frills decor, but the atmosphere is welcoming.  Interesting beers available.  I'm not much of a seafood fan, so if you're like me, you should be warned the menu is seafood heavy."}
{"text":"I love this place. I will return. However, I am making a plea to the owners to fire the rude barmaid that greeted my wife and I when we went in last Friday, April 8. Hopefully after some detective work you'll know who I'm talking about - there were two girls working, along with my bearded friend. This one was a brunette.  Story: We arrived later in the evening on a Friday, so I knew it would be tough getting a table or a spot at the bar. We did eventually find two seats at the bar and sat down. After roughly 5-10 minutes; many passes from this girl with not even a simple greeting or a shred of eye contact given to us. Unusual. Eventually, I called to the barmaid and attempted to order a beer. I was rudely instructed that they were at capacity, and that they could no longer serve new customers. Okay, this is what we're dealing with. Fine by me. Generally, restaurants and bars will have doormen to keep things in check, but I like the fact I can still enter a place (particularly in the colder months) and wait.  After the beer rejection, I proceed to ask if I could have a glass of water while I waited. Again, a rude and curt \"no\" response. My response: \"I can't have a glass of water? Okay, I'll wait\". After roughly 20 minutes or so, and after 2-3 parties had left (roughly 8-9 people), I asked if we could be served. Again, rude response \"It's not going to be happening tonight.\" Stated without eye contact.  What the hell? If it's not going to happen, please tell me so I can go somewhere else to eat instead of allowing me to sit at the bar, hungry and thirsty, for 20 minutes. I'm an easygoing guy, and I've been to this place many, many times and have always had a positive experience. The mussels are great, the beer is top notch, and I've had many friendly conversations with the staff. As a result, I've referred tons of people to this bar.  Smokeless Joes - fire this bitch immediately. She is a cancer at your fine establishment. Everyone is entitled to a bad day or night, but this was not the case. Pure bitchiness, rudeness, and an elitist attitude oozing off of this girl. And to the girl - if you happen to read this review: please heed these words: readfbetweuenthceklyinoesu.   Cheers Smokeless Joe's, you are still beloved."}
{"text":"This is absolutely a regular stop for me, the perfect afterwork drink.  They stock exclusively 'unusual' beers, and 100's of them. There's not a coors in the place, although Mill Street managed to get on tap.  The food is good and reliable appetizers, like bruscheta, mussels, and other tidbits.  If your in for the night, start saving, it's pretty easy to spend $10 a pint. Great place though"}
{"text":"It's back and better than ever.  The new digs look great. Still same staff and some that came back. The place was bust on a Wednesday night for dinner.   Had the chicken Brie and bacon sandwich.  My friends had the jerk mussels and island curry. Thank god they re-opened.  Their new location is 488 college street."}
{"text":"There are not many cool beer bars in the city but this is definitely one of them!  Smokeless Joe is tiny and very intimate.  It's not a good place to go with more than four people and probably not a good place to go on a Friday or Saturday night because you won't get a seat.  Their beer menu is extensive and the special imports can be quite pricey so make sure you love beer.  However, they have a wall of draft beers which are decently priced and also very good!    The servers are super cool and have good recommendations.  Their food menu is small but super tasty.  They have a special half-price oyster night as well!  This place is cozy for a cool date or if you want to hang out with a friend.  It is located in a basement so there is no natural lighting but the ambiance is still nice.  You will find a mixture of young professionals hanging out here or a more mature clientelle but all-in-all no pretentious wanks!"}
{"text":"Holy Thai- the mussels are out of this world. My friend and I decided to find a low key place to wrap up our busy an overly inebriated week in Toronto and settled on Smokeless Joe. How we came to that conclusion I can't recall but it was an excellent choice. It's a small pub with a small menu but an extensive list of beer on tap. Upon recommendation from, well, everyone, we ordered the holy Thai mussels. HEAVEN. I wanted to the whole bowl to myself and an entire baguette to sop up the sauce. But alas I didn't, and I'm regretting that decision.   The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because there was an extremely irritating patron that was making some irritating bird/creature from outer space noise for approximately 10 minutes. I suspect she's a regular, so if you go you may find yourself out on the patio in the cold to escape it like we did. But don't let that stop you, all the bird noises in the world wouldn't keep me from those mussels."}
{"text":"Comfortable and welcoming, in a wooden tables and brick walls kind of way - this new location is definitely a step up (and not just because they're now above ground, ba dum bum). I've been twice this summer and look forward to the cozy warmth I'll find here come winter. They also have a passable 'garden' patio (passable as such only in Toronto, where adding a potted plant to a concrete square of outdoor space might upgrade it to a garden patio). Theirs has 4 or 5 tables and a hedgey border that adds a bit of green to the space. Plastic patio tables, though. Blech.  First and foremost a beer joint, they have a great selection of both draft and bottles. If you're looking for cheap pitchers of something generic, this is not the place for you. If you're interested in trying something new and interesting and understand that only crappy generic draft can be $4 a pint, then Smokeless Joe is your kind of place. Good selection of local microbrews and yummy belgians. Also a reasonable scotch selection.   They have at least a dozen different kinds of mussels. I had the thai mussels ($16), which were spicy, tasty, and full of lemongrass (I'd eat them again, for sure), but not my favourites in the city. Lots of other food on the menu. Prices seem comparable to other places that serve the same fare.   Both times I've been there the service has been friendly and knowledgeable, with a dash of good humour. The kind of place one could spend an evening chatting with friends or curl up at the bar solo with a book and a pint and feel totally comfortable."}
{"text":"Great spot. I was visiting Toronto alone and felt totally comfortable on a Saturday nigh and the bar.  Great beer, very good food - unique (vegan chili and a crostini w/avocado spread that was very good w/a hoppy  beer)"}
{"text":"For some reason $31-$60 a person doesn't sound right but I guess the drinks here can add up fast. Some of the taps will run you around $6-$8 dollars a pint but they're microbrews and there's always a hefty price tag when you're buying anything artisan. I'm kicking myself for not trying the Brut Des Flandres while they still had it. ($52 a pop. Belgian trappist brewed then bottled in Champagne France. Mmmmmm)  Capacity is about 30-35 people and it fills up fast so if you don't get there early you might not get in. The servers have taken my number and called me when things have opened up before so if you're really really nice to them they might extend you the same courtesy. Seating can be a bit of an issue as well since there are only a few little pull out counter style tables for four, bar seating, a small two seater couch and a counter top near the door. The patio in the summer is nice but the scenery is kind of dull. You'll be staring at a shawarma shop or people in line for dance clubs. That can be a good source of entertainment for some but who knows, maybe you like making fun of people or just like to see what they're wearing.  The beer list has somewhere in the neighbourhood of 175 beers on offer which is smaller than some bars but I've found they have a better selection overall. It's relatively easy to stock a bunch of obscure beers from all over but that doesn't mean anyone wants to drink them and it's awful finding out you picked Peroni when you could have had Sam Smith's Winter Welcome Ale.  The food menu is short and sweet. You can choose from about 12 different styles of cooked mussels and there are oysters once or twice a week. The sandwiches are really nice and the soups are hearty. As a special treat, Joe's wife or Joe will cook a big batch of something that is always delicious. Be warned, they like their spices so if you think that Red Rooster hot sauce or Chipotle Tabasco are hot these dishes will melt your face. You should take a taste test first if the servers tell you it's spicy.  Aside from the drinks and food, I've always loved this place for the atmosphere and the servers. They love what they do and really want to make sure people have a good time. The fact that it's a little small is one of the great things about it. Conversations spill across the tables and before you know it you're swept into a debate from two groups over or playing word association games with the whole bar."}
{"text":"Smokeless Joe has NOT closed, but has changed location to College and Bathurst!  Their number is 416.966.5050!"}
{"text":"Brilliant beer selection and at an extremely good price!  Also had the BBLT (The extra B is for Basil), which was spot on, and the huge helping of fries that it came with were a nice addition."}
{"text":"I guess I don't really care about restaurants that have a wide range of menu options or whatever. I more care that a restaurant does one thing and does it well. Because I'm only able to eat one thing per meal, I'm just a human. Smokeless Joe has lots of beers (in bottles mostly, very few taps), and they have mussels with bread, in maybe 6 different sauces/flavours. That's pretty much it. It is a tiny basement place that seats maybe 25 plus a patio that seats maybe 10, so it is tiny. Inside it smells like mussels. I hope you like mussels by the way. Now I'm not saying their mussels are divine or anything; you can't really screw up mussels as long as you don't over cook them. You can only hope to cook them properly, which they do. Which is important. And they are non-smoking but nowadays everyone is so that isn't really a differentiator any more. But I think Toronto needs more places like this; they just do one or two things and they never screw it up."}
{"text":"Hidden below the street level, Smokeless Joe's is just where you want it - below the tourist radar. Mussels marniere, clam chowder and many pints of Durham's - all enjoyed in the company of an Aussie, a Frenchy and some locals, perfect!"}
{"text":"My wife  and I used to be fans of Smokeless Joe  when it was on John St by King. It was a very small pub in a basement with friendly staff and an excellent assortment of beers on tap and in the bottle. They moved this summer to College just west of Bathurst and just recently re-opened. We decided that it would be fun to check it out.  I'm glad we did.  The did an excellent job of doing the decor and the place has a warm cozy feeling even though it is larger than the old place. They also have an upper floor. We didn't go to have a look though.  The staff is friendly as before. Not just the bartender that served us but all the staff were friendly and fun. There are 19 beers on tap and a good selection of bottled beer which they say they are continually expanding. The staff seemed to really know their beer.  In the old place they were known for their mussels and oysters and they carried this over to the new place. The oysters were quite popular and kept Rob our bartender quite busy shucking them. I came close to ordering a couple myself.  It was a fun night. I'm glad that they have re-opened and glad we went. I really wish they were closer to our neighborhood as this would be my regular spot. Although it is a distance away, it is a place worth going out of our way for."}
{"text":"Tried out Smokeless Joe last night with a Groupon I'd bought a while ago. I'm a big seafood lover and my fiancé loves a nice beer selection so we were looking forward to the experience. The atmosphere of the restaurant is awesome. It's cozy and warm and it was just loud enough.   Unfortunately, when we got there, the menu was totally different from the normal menu, which was an unpleasant surprise as the restaurant is known for their huge assortment of mussels and they were only serving a couple kinds. Their beer menu was also drastically cut down and the waiter informed us that even on the cut down menu he gave us, they \"didn't have a bunch of them\". Could be due to a busy weekend so I was willing to overlook it. Service was subpar but there was only one person running the bar and the restaurant so I can see how he'd be overwhelmed. That being said, we ordered fries with our meal which didn't come until five minutes after we'd both finished eating and I was able to grab the waiter and ask about them. When we went to pay the bill, he informed us that the credit/debit wasn't working so we'd have to get cash from their machine downstairs. Really annoying that he didn't mention this when we sat down as we could have grabbed some cash while we were waiting for our food.   Overall, the food was decent, especially the mussels, but probably not worth paying regular prices for. Factoring in the other problems, we probably wouldn't bother trying another night to see if it gets any better."}
{"text":"We arrived late one evening, and sadly the kitchen was closed. The food menu looked great... but luckily the lengthy beer menu was equally as appealing. I love the 'snug' feel it has. Dark, intimate, very welcoming."}
{"text":"Went on the advice of friends.  Amazing.  The ceasar salad was quite possibly the best I've ever eaten, and despite being full, I was soclose to ordering another large plate of mussels.  Definitely a hidden gem and one I will be visiting frequently."}
{"text":"Smokeless Joe is a nice alternative to many of the bars on College, which don't really seem like \"bars\", but more poor man's King West lounges.  The beer selection and space is impressive, they've got an upstairs party room, a back patio, and the bathrooms are expansive and airy.   What takes SJ down a few notches for me: price per pint ($6.75 is high if you're a session drinker), and the food is hit or miss. I went in pretty hungry and asked the barkeep to suggest something- which turned out to be the BLAST (BLT+Salsa+Avocado). Very underwhelming with a giant, inedible, and stale ciabata, and very thinned out inner toppings ($12). I ordered the vegan chilli because I wasn't satisfied/satiated and it was much meatier (in a vegan way) and quite deliciously beany ($8).  The bill came and is printed out from a machine that has to be older than most of the people reading this and we needed the bartender to tell us what each charge was. Was pretty confusing - although they didn't have a problem splitting the bill onto credit-cards....so that's a positive.   I would recommend stopping by for a beer or two....but wouldn't make a night out of it."}
{"text":"Première fois dans ce petit restau-bar sympa! J'y ai mangé un petit sandwich à l'avocat avec frites - mais il parait qu'il faut venir ici pour y déguster les moules. Autrefois au centre-ville, dans le quartier financier, le restaurant s'est reporté sur Collège et connaît un succès réel. Non seulement on y déguste des moules frites, mais le choix en matière de bières de qualité à la pression est impressionnant. Le rendez-vous est pris pour une autre aventure !"}
{"text":"beer +mussels+ oysters what more could I ask for? a hidden little cave gem on john street between king and queen. I got a Durham ESB and an Amsterdam Big Wheel Amber. Both were delicious. I shared oysters and mussels with my friend. The oysters were decent.  I prefer West Coast ones. The Jerk mussels were just the perfect amount of spicy. I would recommend the mussels over the oysters. The cost is quite pricey, but the atmosphere and the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I like beer. I like mussels. If you like beer, and/or mussels, you will love Smokeless Joe!  When I'm serious about enjoying my beer, I prefer to enjoy my beer in a non-douchebag type of environment.    This place is just what I was looking for!  You can sit here for hours throwing back pints and catching up.   They have an extensive beer list, so you'll always have something new to try. I'm a slave to marketing and they had these awesome \"Hops and Robbers\" coasters.  So, for my second beer, I had to order a pint.  We started with a few oysters each.  They don't have a large selection of oysters, but I was still happy with our oysters from P.E.I.  They weren't cleanly shucked but that's alright.   I was surprised by the variety of mussels. If you fancy jerk spice or bacon infused mussels, they've got them!   I like my mussels simple.  We split a large order of the Belgium style mussels ($15) with a Blanche De Chambley base.  Once we finished our bread, they brought us a refill! Awesome.  For dessert, we shared the carrot cake with ...espresso icing? It sounded strange....but it was actually pretty delicious.   Even though the cake didn't taste anything like carrot cake.  I had a great time here! I'm totally coming back."}
{"text":"Smokeless Joe's 2.0  The new version is a lot like the old one. Same old Mullet-ed cook, great wait staff, and super selection of beers.  The new version has a cave-y architecture, I love it! The brick walls, the beamed ceilings, the curved archways.  The new version has 2 floors!  Just like Le Select is missing their hanging bread baskets, Smokeless Joe's no longer has the prop-up tables ready for a crowd at any time.  They no longer have the oysters sitting on an ice bed display.  They no longer have the page after page of bottled beer.  Instead, they have decided to go more for draught beer instead of storing large quantities of bottled beer.  Tonight, I got a Pineapple beer, and my husband got a Belgian 8.5% Delerium Tremens. Perhaps this makes them more like other pubs, and less like the deep-storeroom of Old Smokeless Joes. But, there isn't a Hooters across the street, nor a chain Shwarma place.  A little further from my place, but maybe we're all headed West? Still love Joe."}
{"text":"Small place with a busy-but-intimate atmosphere. Bartenders are extremely friendly and knowledgable. Tuesday's $1 oysters can't be beat - but be prepared, it can get a little packed. Great beer selection with rotating taps and a good belgian beer selection. Stick with the mussels (the jerk mussels are amazing) but skip the clam chowder."}
{"text":"An amazing selection of beers, great service and a cozy inviting atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is apparently relocating so they didn't have much of selection on this visit. Ambiance is very laid back. Huge Selection of beer which is almost at par with Beer Bistro. The place is kind of pricey (if you order stuff by the bottle) as we were taken aback by the final tab. Recommended for Beer Luvers. The mussels looked great BTW maybe next time I will give the food a try. 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Had a great evening here. The beer selection is phenomenal, and the prices are very reasonable. The back patio is a great spot to hang out with a date over drinks and good food. The menu is not huge, but its well thought out and everything on it sounds delicious. We had the shrimp pesto appetizer which was to die for, and the jerk mussels and the moutarde mussels which were both AMAZING. Service was perfect, not too much and not too little. Wish this place was closer to home, I'd be there at least once a week if it were."}
{"text":"Decent, if pricey microbrews. We came here for a birthday last weekend. Our first server was knowlegable and friendly and we had the upstairs to ourselves. The place was kinda dead, so a much less friendly server kicked us out at 12 (ON a Saturday!)"}
{"text":"I was recently introduced to Smokeless Joe's by another Yelper and I've already been back a couple times.   The bar is pricey but the vibe is pretty good when you consider the area and the kind of obnoxious people one sometimes runs into around these parts.   The service is good, the staff are friendly, when I asked about one of the beers on tap I got a very detailed description that described it perfectly.   The selection of beer on tap is great! Tasty beers that must have been hand-picked by someone with good taste! I think there are around 10 taps which is pretty good in itself but they also seem to mostly have interesting beers on tap (while I was there, they weren't wasting any taps on something like Moosehead or Heineken). The bottled selection is vast and can match any bar (even the Bier Markt in that department).  It's small and cozy and warm and welcoming! When I mentioned to my boss that I was checking this place out for the first time, he told me it was his standard \"first date\" bar. And if you like a casual, warm atmosphere, non-pretentious atmosphere - I can see why!   It seems like they only have counter seating & high chair/table seating which is a small pet peeve of mine (it means I certainly won't spend the entire evening there as at some point I'll be off searching for a more comfortable place to sit as I get more and more tipsy).  If it wasn't for the price and the seating, it would definitely be a 4 star."}
{"text":"I came here with a group deal and brought a friend. We had Thai muscles, the mushroom salad and a dozen oysters. Everything was delicious.   The muscles were fresh and the sauce was incredible.  The mushroom salad had huge portobello mushrooms with cheese. Yum!   It was busy and our server was still attentive and helpful. She recommended a spiced beer that I didn't care for, but otherwise it was a perfect meal;   Smokeless joe's exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"A guy I was briefly dating brought me to Smokeless Joe's twice. I loved the place despite the narrow, underground setting. It was very merry on a busy Saturday night and chill on a quiet Sunday afternoon. The long and interesting beer menu made me happy - I can't drink wine so the wine lists that other people freak out over mean nothing to me. I tried a few rather exotic brews (something Czech, something Belgian) but I also enjoyed a good, frosty, familiar Kirin Lager.  The guy who brought me here told me Joe's is his favourite place in town: it was his closely guarded secret, right down the street from his condo. Unfortunately, on the fourth or fifth date, that guy stood me up and I never heard from him again. To me, standing someone up for a date is unthinkably rude. He's not dead, this was just pure bad manners. That kind of disrespectful behaviour deserves to be punished and here's how you can help: make Smokeless Joe's your regular hang-out place. Invite all your friends. Get your friends to invite all their friends. Tell everyone! The place will be packed full all night, every night, and that bad mannered dude will lose his favourite bar.  Thanking you in advance and see you at Smokeless Joe's!"}
{"text":"So if my best friend in the world was in town and wanted to have a beer, this is the place I'd take him.  This is my best buddy, so he deserves the best beer.  Naturally that means the most unique, tastiest and most importantly, of the highest alcohol content.  The best also isn't cheap, but this is my best friend we're talking about here.  It's not just about the beer, this is a straight up cool place to hang out.  I didn't have them but they mussels smelled amazing.  Round it up with a friendly and accommodating staff  and you've got the makings of a world class bar!"}
{"text":"Great food. Ordered the ham and cheese panini & it hit the spot. The poutine was also super delish and old school, Montreal style. Our server was nice, checking in without being overwhelming. And for the portion sizes, the prices were great.  Only odd thing: a man walked up and asked us how our food was. He then came by 20min later & took a picture of my food. We later found out he was the owner; but his behaviour, without actually introducing himself, was kinda creepy.  I would def go back for the food but may have to eat mob-life style: back against the wall, surveying the whole room."}
{"text":"We were on the \"North\" pub crawl, and it sucked. Never saw more than a handful of people at each venue. The representatives just sat and talked with their friends @ the Victory. Maybe the \"South\" crawl was a better choice. We gave up after Smokeless Joes. husband and I thought we would try the new location last night. We were on a \"pub crawl\" and based on reviews thought that Joe's would be the best choice for food. We were so wrong. We asked about the oyster selection and were told that it was only Malpeques(yawn). From my seat I could see into the kitchen and was not pleased to see the cooks digging in the deep freezer every  5 minutes. The specials listed lobster bisque and a pork chop and vegetable dinner. The bisque had the consistency of nacho cheese sauce and had no lobster flavour. The pork chop was good but the frozen mixed vegetables were still cold. When someone from the kitchen came by and asked us about our food, my husband mentioned the cold veggies, but there was no apology.  We were happy with the beer selection, and the vibe and service were good. Might go back, but would just stick with the beer."}
{"text":"More beer place reviews. Hooray. Maybe this time I can be interesting.  If you don't like beer, don't go. Seriously. If you like beer, go.   This is a place you can easily walk by. It's down in the basement, it's dark, but it's fantastic. The beers rotate regularly, but they're always great and almost always unique (at least from what I've found in the city). The staff feels like your friends almost immediately, and know their beers (although, I guess you'd have to, if you're working in a place like this). The beers are expensive, but again, they're unique, so I guess it's expected.   The food, from what I've eaten, is ok. I've never gone there for \"dinner\", per se, but rather I realize, after having drank three 12% beers that, \"uh, maybe I should eat something.\" So I'm probably not the best expert for their food selection.   I haven't gone in a while (I blame you, winter), but I miss it deeply. Soon, we'll meet again, Smokeless Joes."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon, $20 for $40. Went on a Friday night, looking forward to oysters and beer and mussles.  We were greeted right away, seated and drinks brought promptly. We ordered the chili garlic mussles, the crostini with tomato something or other and serano ham, and 10 oysters.  The crostini was delicious. I think it was bruscetta mix with ham on top, which I love, but could have made at home and for a couple of bucks instead of $8 for four small slices of bread. That was really disappointing.  Oysters - good. Malpeques. Good size and the house hot sauces were really nice. $2.25/oyster.  Mussles. Oh geez, not good.  A huge bowl of broth like water, but it tasted like water, and definitely not enough mussles to charge me $18. EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. There was maybe a pound or so in there. Which when I buy it, would cost me like $4 and I can get the water broth for free, thanks very much.  Overall the service was good until a whack of people came in for Beer Week on a pub crawl. Our server never came back. Some guy came to take our dishes away, asked how the mussles were and I was honest with him. Not good, tasteless, not spicy and definitely not garlicky.  He said, \"yeah, well we got someone new in the kitchen, so....\".  So..............................................?  So I won't be back. I am sad I wasted my money here."}
{"text":"Smokeless seems to be moving! They've been shuttered for a few days, and according to servers at another local bar, they are moving to a bigger space. I don't have the details yet, but for now Smokeless seems to be  out of commission."}
{"text":"Smokeless Joe's blew my mind, completely unexpectedly mental H-bomb.  Beer Rookie(me) decides to have an enjoyable evening with Friends over few beers. Accomodating dude sat us right away with the Beer List notes to us a handful of N/A. Quite funny actually because the last thing I expect at a Pub is a Memory Test. If you're wondering, I bomb'd as I barely knew 1/4 of the choices to start.  2-sided 8x11 Beer Selection($varies) provided  -  1 side.   Draft Pints.        $Pint Value($6.00-ish) 2 side.   Import Bottles.   $Massive Destruction to the Wallet($15.00-ish)  Comme ça va?   Beer Price Range: $$ - $$$$ At least it's not that Samuel Adams Utopias. First time discovery Beer can be $10.00+ is a scary moment. Now I know Premium Beering is not for moi but good as option. At least not til \"someone\" from Maple, ON wins Lotto Max.  Btw, Washrooms look nothing like the Gastropub atmosphere in Dining space. Probably give you the feeling of Home, it is so clean you feel bad messing it up."}
{"text":"Enjoy beer? Enjoy mussels? Smokeless Joe's is the coolest small little place in Toronto to enjoy both. The beer menu here is massive and everybody is sure to find something they like...as an added bonus the staff is uber knowledgeable about the menu and will gladly point you in the right direction!"}
{"text":"Good: Vegetarian poutine, sitting at the bar  Bad: Tables are very uncomfortable, sometimes taps are empty."}
{"text":"I can't really add anything new to what people are saying.  I went in on a Monday and felt like I owned the place.  Bartender was helpful and omnipresent. I downed a couple beers near the end where they are cooking up the mussels.  Big mistake!  Every pan that went by made me hungrier and hungrier. I was debating ditching my dinner plans. Some time I would go back and stuff myself. I don't think there was an offering on the menu that didn't look good.  Also, I missed Tuesday oyster night - buck Malpeques."}
{"text":"Love this place! Loved especially seeing an entire side of a menu dedicated to various MUSSEL dishes. There must have been a dozen different options, mostly priced at $16.   The bowl is huge, I would guess 3 dozen mussels. I tried the \"Greek mussels\" (don't laugh!) which had tomatoes, black olives and feta along with a nice white wine and oregano broth. The mussels come served with a demi loaf of toasted baguette, perfect for dipping in the broth. They were cooked perfectly.   On Thursdays they have $5 tapas as well, there was a small menu of 5-6 items. We tried some shrimp flautas served with guac and sour cream, they were crispy. Not bad.  Staff is quite pleasant here and the bar/restaurant is kind of dark and a bit romantic. They were playing some lovely 80s ska which I really enjoyed.   Lots of craft beers too, if that is your thing."}
{"text":"These are seriously the most fantastic mussels you will ever have the privilege of enjoying. If you're reading this and like mussels, head over at your earliest opportunity! The service is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"I have very fond memories of getting extremely trashed at this place with my father before we staggered down the street to the movie theater and fell asleep during \"Seabiscuit.\" I believe smoking was still legal in bars back then, so Smokeless Joe was a relief both for that and for the incredible selection of craft beers, microbrews, and international artisan beers on tap. I think all those words basically mean the same thing, but I wanted to use them in the same sentence anyway. Dad was paying, so I basically ordered as many of the most expensive and strangest sounding items on the menu, filling my head with suds of various provenances: dubels, trippels, and even a quadrupel, I believe. My review of this place is probably worthless, because it's been so long since I was there (2003?), but it's arguably worth a visit if it's been around that long and its original gimmick, being smoke-free, is no longer even relevant. I believe they serve food, and I probably ate some of it, but you'll pack on calories enough with just the beer. Beer is energy, you know."}
{"text":"Wow. So many taps (20?) yet only 6 draught choices. No excuses. The place seems to be (sadly) going under. Too bad."}
{"text":"At the risk of sounding like a crazy person (which I'm sure I have in many of my reviews) I can't possibly say enough good things about this place.  I was introduced to this place several years ago by one of my beer-snob friends.  I honestly cant find anything to complain about except that it's very small and very dark.  The \"tables\" too leave much to be desired but honestly every time I've been here I've either been at the bar or on my feet.  For many years the owner resisted getting a TV to try and help keep the focus on beer, food and socialization.  A few years ago however he relented and purchased a small flat-screen to help draw in a few more during the world cup.  The beer selection competes with the best in this city and it's a VERY short list.  (Bar Volo, C'est What?, and Biermarket)  They do fall behind however in the number of taps.  They only have one cask and 4 or 5 taps.  The rest of the list is in bottles.  The tap list however is always fresh and always rotating between some of the finest micro-brews available.  NB: if they have Delirium Tremins on tap, be warned... It will knock you out if you have more than 3.  (Take a hint from the pink elephants on the glassware)  The food is a little pricey for what it is considering they don't have a full kitchen and this place literally is a hole in the ground.  But the oysters are excellent and the mussels are fantastic.  I will continue to patronize this establishment until I die, or they change hands and get turned into a dive.  It's such an intimate, friendly, small place so don't think you can come here with your entire corporate office party.  30 people in here is PACKED.  (Packed like Tokyo station at rush-hour!)"}
{"text":"We ventured in here solely because of the sign outside that said NBA Playoffs! Ordered a Heineken, but was told they only do draft beers, so I ordered a Vodka & Soda instead. Later on the bartender recommended a local draft beer, and an Ontario made vodka. I'm all for all things Canadian, so they were all awesome.   The bartender was super nice and friendly. I didn't finish my beer, so he didn't even charge us for it. The TV downstairs is very small, the big screen is upstairs. You can change the channel to whatever, so we changed it to the Glaxy Radio channels 900 and played shuffleboard, which actually makes for an awesome drinking game. Oh yeah, SHUFFLEBOARD upstairs. Good beer, great service."}
{"text":"Smokeless Joe used to be downtown on John Street. They suddenly disappeared in the summer and there were rumours that they would opening at a new location.  Three months later they recently reopened on College Street, just west of Bathurst. We checked it out last evening.  The old location was in a basement and cavernous. The new location is on the street level (they also have space on the second floor) and they have renovated it to be similar to the old digs.  We sat at the bar ... Rob, the bartender, took good care of us.  The food menu consists mainly of mussels (they are very popular). In addition to ensuring everyone has a drink, Rob also gets those ready.  The draft selection is good ... lots of craft beer. And their beer menu is still quite extensive, though not as large as it was at their old location.  Glad to see them back!"}
{"text":"When i want mussels and great beer, I go here. I love the homey ambiance of this place, reminds me of bars in Europe. On my last trip i shared the Mussels Provecal with my hubby - tomatoes and herbs were very fresh and tasty. I will definitely be back to try other varieties. I wish they had frites to go with them instead of bread ;)  Beers on tap here are local, bottles from all over the place, definitely a super selection for your own personal Beer Festival."}
{"text":"Great global beer selection, super mussels from PEI and home made hot sauce with funny names! I need to go back soon. It's got a really cool vibe too - nice and cosy, and friendly bartenders. Spend enough time there and I'm sure it's one of those places \"where everybody knows your name\"..."}
{"text":"Now that Smokeless Joe has moved to College, it's different. In some ways it's better (sweet back patio! way more taps!)... but in most ways it's worse (just not the same, lots of my favourite staff left for BarHop, no more vegan chili?? definitely smells different...)  Celebrating a birthday here yesterday with mussels (still excellent) there were a few pretty serious issues...   Most of the beers weren't pouring. They said their delivery guy brought them an empty gas tank instead of a full one by accident, which isn't their fault, but it's annoying because it's a beer bar! There were a few that were still okay so we still had beer, but I was down to my third choice by the time I got a \"yes that one is okay.\"  When I went to pay their debit and credit machine wasn't working and they don't have a bank machine. They should have told us this when we walked in. I wanted to treat my birthday guest but instead she had to pay for her own birthday dinner (and mine!) because the staff didn't advise that it was cash only (when it's usually not). The waitress said \"...but there is a BMO like, RIGHT there\" - it's actually not that close when there is a foot of slush everywhere and you're thinking about leaving a friend waiting for you while you get cash (2 streets away, definitely a 10+m round trip).  Other than the cash only thing, which really left me soured on this place, the service was pretty good and the food was good, but after making a special trip last night I don't think I would do that again. If I lived in the neighbourhood I would swing by here more regularly, but I am not going to drive across town to dine here again.  Pros: - If you are already in Little Italy, it's a good choice for beer selection - They have a huge variety of mussels - The food is good  Cons: - It's a bit expensive - If you don't eat seafood there are less than 4 things for you to have"}
{"text":"Great little hidden bar right smack dab in the clubbing district. Fantastic for the adventurous beer-taster (recommend: St. Paull Double and the Gulden Draak - both intriguing and scintillating flavors). Great chit-chat bar for those looking to catch up or get to know each other."}
{"text":"to the woman working the bar tuesday night: i am an idiot for not sitting with you.  she was a riot. we come in, the place is pretty empty, and she steps over to us and tells us about our seating options. there's the bar (\"a very social place\"), the tables (\"comfortable\") and the seats facing the wall (\"the last choice, or where loners go\").   i want to sit at the bar, but my friends prefer a table so we sit down. we order our beers (the selection is amazing! i loved the both the barley wine and scotch ale i had) and talk amongst ourselves while the employees hang out at the bar, joking around and enjoying themselves. a little while later i see a couple sitting at the wall-facing seats, despite ample room away from the wall. loners? dimwits? so i ask the woman working the bar.  she steps close and proceeds to analyze this couple in great detail, describing their selection process (\"they were about to leave but then they saw the wall-facing seats and were taken in by them.. i know, THE WALL FACING SEATS!\") and their obvious happiness (\"i know i said no one would choose the wall seats when others are available, but i guess they're for loners AND lovebirds\"). i'm giggling because i'm a little buzzed, and she's clearly a partytime personality as loud bursts of laughter pour forth from her. i see the loner couple looking our way. we both look toward them, shrug, and move on.  a few minutes later the bartender is bundled up, at the door. she waves goodbye to everyone, lets out one last quick burst of laughter, and bounds up the stairs.  did i mention the beers are fantastic?"}
{"text":"We only stopped in for a beer since their back patio was open on a slightly chilly but very sunny day. Service was very strange, I'm not sure if the guy is the owner but he comes off as drunk and homeless (although nice and somewhat pleasant). He gave us very good beer suggestions...but again something is off with him. I really don't meant to be offensive, but the server and service is part of the experience of dining/drinking out. The back patio is wonderful, it's so private and secluded I could see us coming back here again."}
{"text":"I am quite torn about this place. 3 stars seems like a harsh ruling to give this place considering all of the other 4+ stars its getting, but like the definition says it was A-OK. Maybe this sort of establishment is not my M.O.   I came to this place to check out their extensive beer list. I read that the place was small and cozy. When people say its small and cozy it is VERY small and cozy. So small that there aren't any tables, only a lining of bar stools and tables. There can never be more than 20-30 people in there because it would be packed.  This place is meant for a drink and a snack, not a dinner. Their food menu is a double sided sheet of paper filled mostly with mussel creations. Because I went there with the intention of eating dinner, my wife and I ordered some avocado bruschetta, mussels, and a salami sandwhich. All were very good dishes but not dinner worthy. More snack worthy.   As a side note, they do have oysters on their menu, which doesn't suit my tastes but for others it might. I also remember reading a special (some weekday I forget) that has 12 oysters for $12. Considering their regular price per oyster was 2.50-3.50, this sounds like a bargian.  At any one time they usually have 10 taps and a large selection of imported beers from around the world. Like others have said as well the beers are very expensive, even for something more common like Hoegaarden or Mill St. I appreciate the attempt to bring in beers of the world, but many of the beers on the list can be found at other places that have a beer menu.  Nice people, unique place, friendly atmosphere, but doesn't quite suit  my dining style (which shouldn't be a knock on them)."}
{"text":"New Smokeless Joe is located on College just West of Bathurst which I found it much better than their old John Street location.   Still the great staff and the great beers selections as the old location and even have more on taps!!!   For the time being, only the main floor is opened but they opening up the upper level soon and by next patio season roll in their backyard patio will be up and running too!!  My order of Belgian Style Mussels ($15) was great to go with my beer. The bartender was really helpful in helping my Yelp Drinking Buddy to find the beer that he enjoyed.  Now with the full kitchen in this location, they are able to expand their food menu too..   BTW, kitchen closes at 12 and earlier but you can always order some raw oysters."}
{"text":"LOL, What beer selection?  When Smokeless Joe's was on John St years ago they had at least 50 beers.  Great selection.  This new incarnation....I went on Saturday night, took friends who assured them this place would have a great beer selection, and well...no they don't.  They had 9 beers on tap, and none in bottles.  LOL 9 beers. AND half of them were Mill St or Amsterdam.  Don't go here expecting to get anything not easily available at any LCBO location.  Sorry I thought this was a serious bar for beer, it's not.  Staff are kind of odd too.  Won't be back.    Can't judge on food as we didn't have any.  But if you are looking for a great selection of interesting and rare beers....try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Meet the new boss, not quite the same as the old boss. For those who don't know, Smokeless Joe is a transplant. It's previous incarnation was a shortbus-sized subterranean dwelling on John street. The unlikely location was superseded only by the unlikely beer list (hundreds of options) and its outstanding edibles. This new location is no longer an impossible-to-find-a-seat hole in the wall, but rather a full two floors on College street (right by Bathurst). It's a grown up pub now, and has thus sloughed off a bit of its erstwhile adolescent charm.  That said, the bar is an awesome place to settle down. They have over 200 different bottles here, and usually a dozen or so beers on tap, but they were out of a bunch of things due to a busy weekend. I ordered my favourite standby, the vegan chili ($8). It's not quite the same as I remember it, but still a fair portion and mighty tasty. I will still a bit hungry, and watching our server shucking sparked an impromptu order of ten caraquets ($2.75 each). Good oyster; not very briny and it tastes great with some hot sauce.  No longer the coolest kid in club district, Smokeless Joe is more of an average Joe among the other spectacular options on College street. Still, I'm happy they are back in business. I will surely return.  Obligatory Title Pun: Hey JOE/where you going with that beer in your hand?  Menu Readability: One rarely needs to invoke bold and italic on the same word.  Need to mention: Their receipts are laughably old school, but they do take credit.  What this place teaches me about myself: I like my underground spots to be literally underground."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying that not only do I not eat mussels, but I also don't drink beer. And those are the two house specialties at Smokeless Joe!!!   So what exactly brought me to Smokeless Joe, then? Well...the vegetarian (vegan, even) chili!! It came highly recommended and I'm glad I stopped in to try it. The place is very, very small - there's probably only enough seating for 25 people in the whole place, and that's including seats at the bar, so for dinner I'd say maybe 15 people can eat comfortably (or uncomfortably, depending how much room you take up). It took about 30 minutes for the chili to arrive but I have no doubt that it was because it was being made from scratch, and it was well worth the wait. It was brimming with beans...chickpeas, kidney, black beans...and some sort of bulghur or quinoa base that was unusual and tasty. The portion was very big and came with a nice French bread for dipping."}
{"text":"Brought here by friends, Smokeless Joe is casual and low-key, a dive bar meant in the best way.  The staff were friendly and relaxed, no attitude.  Narrow, the main level has a few tables up front, a row next to the bar that properly dominates the space, and more tables in the back.  I think there's another level also.  The beer menu had a diverse selection, one list of bottled imports, fairly expensive at an average of $15 for 350 mL or so, the other of their beers on draft, more reasonably priced but still pricey for a session.  All in all, an interesting selection to choose from.  I tried the Belgian Pauwel Kwak, a pale ale; friends had Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock, Fruli strawberry wheat,  Great Lakes Pumpkin Ale.  We didn't have any food there, but that's on offer too.  Nice place for a bar stop, quiet enough to have good conversation, not crowded enough to have to fight for space."}
{"text":"I did not want to leave Smokeless Joe's.  The coolest little beer bar we found on our trip.  Amazing beer list that covered places from around the world that you never see on a beer list in the states.  They had a beer from Bosnia fer cryin out loud.  If I were to ever be lucky enough to run a beer bar I would probably model it after Smokeless Joe: a cozy little place with some outside seating, a kitchen that would consist of two burners where you'd find that day's special cooking, rotating taps and a drool worthy bottle list.  Amazing.  I could have dropped a fortune at this place.  Speaking of which -- good lord Toronto, you are expensive to hang out with!"}
{"text":"If you're not feeling Italian food and/or a lounge and you're in Little Italy this is great little alternative. Smokeless Joe is a small and dark gastropub, with a hidden backyard patio.   Their two specialties are beer and mussels. I'm a huge fan of both, so SJ is my idea of a good start to an evening out.   My friend and I shared a dozen Malbec oysters and the blue cheese and white wine mussels. Oysters were great. Ask for some of the house's hot sauce to come with them. Just a bit, they aren't kidding with their XXX rating. The mussels were good, and the blue cheese didn't overwhelm them.  I ordered the beer of the night, which the server described to me as ginger-y. It wasn't ginger-y, and I told him I didn't much like it, in a sweet conversational way. He gave me a blank stare. I wasn't trying to send it back, more so just trying to suss out if he would recognize perhaps he'd described it wrong and offer me another option... he obviously wasn't going to budge on that. He later admitted he hadn't tried the beer he'd described. This incident sort of annoyed me, but I did order the beer* in question blindly, so it's half my fault... there were a bazillion other options.  COMING BACK FOR: They have half-priced Oysters on Mondays!   *I seriously can't remember the name of the gosh darn beer in question. I feel like a sub-par Yelper today. Will start taking better notes. ;)"}
