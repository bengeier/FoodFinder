{"text":"Much like Adele, I had a roller-coaster of an experience.   My fiancé and I were regulars (2-3 times per week) before, and couldn't get enough. I would order the chicken shawarma and my fiancé always had the butter chicken. We had one great experience after another and I even started going out of my comfort zone slowly trying new dishes.  And one day we arrive and see new people (we assumed they were new employees, but turned out later its new owners) at the service counters, and the nice man who was always there, nowhere to be seen.   We gave them 3 tries. The first time the service was slow and clumsy, and the food was just Ok comparing to before, but we figured \"hey, these guys might be on their 1st day on the job, let's give them a break\". The second time we came in, in addition to the extremely slow and clumsy service, the chicken shawarma looked sad, the salad was buried under a mountain of cabbage and the rice was bland. Not wanting to give up, we came in on the 3rd time, and that was just sad. We were the only customers in the store this time, and waited for 25 minutes for the 2 \"fast food\" dishes. The shawarma was previously cut off the roll, put on the side, and when I ordered it was pulled out of some hole and thrown on the flat top. Needless to say it was dried and all of the spices got cooked out of it. My fiancé's butter chicken had the \"fresh out of the can\" taste, and the rice had a grease film in it (yuk)."}
{"text":"How do i start with this review? My girlfriend works in the area and i kept seeing this place and always wanted to try it. So one day i did. Took my girlfriend for a lunch date. This is around mid March 2014.  There wasn't any customer at the time, its actually just me and my girlfriend. I decided to get the tandori chicken... But when i ordered, the server guy told me to get the tikka instead... He said its pretty much the same... So I'm like oookkaaayyy... Me and gf looked at each other. Like one of those days that you guys have the same thought. In this case its the WTF?  The food was OK, can't really complain. Typical shawarma like. But i decided to test again how lazy this guy is... So checked the menu again and see what i can ordered. Saw the mango shake and ordered... Can you guys guess what the guy said?  ... \"Do you want the mango juice in a bottle instead? Its pretty much the same\"   I Said: \"No thanks!\" and we bolted."}
{"text":"Tried the Chicken Shawarma salad today & it was excellent.  Portion was large, salad was fresh, and the homemade yoghurt dressing had the right amount of garlic kick!  My kids ordered the chicken wings which were good as well.  Take-out style restaurant with a few tables.  Great little place for some home style cooking, healthy and at a good price point."}
{"text":"Good shawarma and falafel for a very reasonable price.  The location is clean and the staff are very friendly.  The hot sauce could be hotter though... Overall a good find in Pickering."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, nice and fresh. Service was good, chicken tandoori and beef kebabs were very tasty. The only negative point was they had no A/C or ventilation.   It was very, very hot and sweaty, we was unable to eat comfortably in the seating area."}
{"text":"My shawarma was packed with meat and fresh ingredients. Their service was friendly and quick. I'll definitely be trying other items on this menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The folks in here are super nice and their portions are amazing. I get shawarma plates pretty often all over the GTA and I am very happy Pickering has a good spot for this. I like it. Maybe it depends on who is serving you because other reviews say the portions aren't good, however my guy and I thought wow this is amazing quantity!   Anyway, we love this place."}
{"text":"The Afghan Kebob and Shwarma  UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!!!!!  Since being under new management has excelled in providing the best Shwarma in the neighbourhood.The food was excellent and flavourful served with exceptional customer service from a man who was always smiling Jawed appears to be dedicated to the freshest posible ingredients and produce he can get. The difference between the previous owner and Jawed is like night and day.Iam looking forward to trying some of his other dishes the next time I return his restaurant and I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"This is my second visit in about two weeks.  I had never been before but decided to check it out.    The owner suggested I try his Chicken Shawarma.  He cut it off a spit and than grilled it and put it in a fresh pita with various ingredients that he says they prepare daily themselves.  It was than put onto a panini type press and grilled even more.  Very tasty.  I also opted for a naan bread with garlic spread that is house made.  Very garlicky and very good.  It will definitely keep the vampires away! Lol.  The naan was even baked fresh in a tandoor oven which was cool.  I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to change my review. I came here only to see that there were new ppl running the show. I missed the previous man who always knew exactly what me and my gf wanted. The new people were not as friendly. The chicken and rice replicate from nyc was not the same. The chicken was very dry and the rice didn't have any taste. They also didn't give me the extra sauce I usually get. Will not be coming back here. And after seeing that gross raw chicken picture I will not let my friends or family come here either. Such a disappointment. In search of a new chicken and rice fix!"}
{"text":"Love their shawarma plate! Friendly people behind the cash register. I normally eat my lunch here and they are always quick to make it and provide a good service"}
{"text":"Love this food, great portion, awesome price, kind people and clean  lunch special with fries is a great deal #yum #yum"}
{"text":"Good staff and delicious schwarma's I haven't tried anything else other than the chicken Schwarma but it's fantastic best Schwarma i have had in Durham"}
{"text":"Got a shawarma from here tonight but I felt it was quite underwhelming. The wrap wasn't nicely put together and the service was slow. On top of that none of the flavours seemed to stick out to me. Overall just felt like a pretty \"meh\" experience. This place is close to my house and so I'll give it another go to see if maybe it was just an off day."}
{"text":"Very small place but very good food. We ordered the family dinner that Kebab, Naan,  and rice! Everything was fresh and we'll cooked! The only thing the portions were not big enough."}
{"text":"My first time to visit this restaurant and my first impression was... AMAZING.:)  The young gentlemen taking my order was very friendly and suggested a dinner which I enjoy immensely. It's been YEARS since I've eaten authentic Afghan food and this restaurant truly gave me something to come back for. To the owner & chef, great food To the Guy taking my order, you cool .  I will defniately be back again.:)  Finally, the restaurant was CLEAN, which means a lot to new comers.  Keep up the good work.  MARKO"}
{"text":"As much as it saddens me to write this, I feel I must. We came here a few weeks ago only to find that this restaurant has now changed hands.  I ordered the Tandoori Chicken again anticipating the wonderful food coma I had once experienced with this dish... unfortunately, it fell short of 'heavenly' this time. I was left feeling, sort of, just... meh.   I was hoping that it was just a one-off, a bad day perhaps, so I decided to leave it a week or so and try them again.   We came back last week, again for the Tandoori Chicken (using it as a benchmark). The food was good but nowhere near what it had once been.  Don't get me wrong, the food IS still good and I will continue to come here but it's simply not as good as it was. The rice isn't as good as it was, the seasoning and flavours aren't as good as they were and the hot sauce isn't as good as it was. The service? Nowhere near what it was.  I miss the charismatic gentleman that used to be here every time we came. The level of service we received from him contributed to the overall experience and the 5-star rating I had given not too long ago.   I am sorry to say but I really believe they are no longer worthy of 5-stars. I hope things return to normal but I'm not holding my breath. Very sad."}
{"text":"I spent most of 2012 in Afghanistan, and I spotted this place by chance not far from work. I've been meaning to head down to Don Mills & St. Dennis which seems to be a little Afghan enclave in Toronto to try out some of the restaurants there, but I hadn't gotten to it when I tried this place.  I was excited to see Chapli Kebab on the menu, one of my favourite things I ate regularly while in Kabul. Over there it was made from a mix of ground beef, peppers, and onions. Afghan Kebab and Shawarma just seems to use a hamburger patty and add spices to it. It's not quite what I had hoped, but it was never the less tasty and accompanied by a generous portion of rice, a green salad, and naan. One thing to note, Afghan naan is not Indian naan, it's more dense and chewy, and it's usually served with a spicy dipping sauce. If you're new to it it may surprise you.  So the meal was decent.  They also offer shawarma which looked good, and a guy I got chatting with on the way out had it and said it was excellent, probably his favourite. I'll take that under advisement.  I also like that they have a menu to hand out, and you can call ahead for pickup.  This seems like a family run joint, and I wish them much success. I'll be back. But guys, can you maybe add kofta qorma something to the menu - I really miss that. I know qabili palaw is probably too much for a quick service place, but qorma... maybe? Lutfan?"}
{"text":"Beef tikka with salad, rice and naan for $12.99  I got the meal to go so while I was carrying the meal to my car I felt how light my bag was. I found the portion to be very small. The weight is way different when I am carrying Chinese food.  The naan was stale. Even after putting in the microwave it could not be saved. It was so tough that by the time I finish eating half the naan my jaw was sore from all the chewing I had to do. Same goes for the the beef. It was tough and chewy but alot better than the naan. The best part of the meal was the salad so you can tell how disappointing this was for me."}
{"text":"I am very impressed.  My wife picked up a Kebab and rice plate and falafel and chicken shwarma wraps for me. Everything was actually really amazing . I asked for extra tahini on mine and it was not soggy at all but I could taste the extra sauce.  The falafel was soft and yummy not dried out at all .  We will be going back for sure. Love the fact that you can get your afghan style kebab and rice plates and also shawarma and falafel. Fresh and tasty ....I'm sold."}
{"text":"Afghan Kebab recently opened up and I can't stop ordering from them! They have reasonable prices. Their beef and chicken  Kebabs and  chicken boti are nicely seasoned. The rice and salad are generous portions. This a great healthy option for dinner or lunch and they've also recently started opening on Sundays which is rare for mom and pops in Pickering. The only thing is  I find their Tandori quarter chicken legs  often comes looking and tasting dry because they are fried. The owner is friendly and hard working."}
{"text":"Afghan shwarma is located in the Swiss Chalet plaza juat east of Highway 2 and whites road in the storefront that used to be Mr. Sub.  There aren't many shwarma places in Pickering or Ajax so I was pleased when this place opened up. I came in on a weeknight and decided to just get a shwarma wrap. The two guys behind the counter were friendly while I paid and they made up my shwarma.    The shwarma itself was tasty, had good flavor and they had grilled it in its wrapper for a few minutes after making it, which gave it a nice overall warmth that brought the flavors together. The hot sauce on here was good, as were the tahini and whatever other sauce they put on. I get the works on my shwarma so it was very tasty, a few too many onions but that's just me. No matter where you get it from, shwarma always ends up being messy! This was no exception. Yummy delicious juice coming out the bottom from the shwarma itself and all the tasty sauces you get!  While this place was good (and the price right), its not the best shwarma I've had so I\"m leaving it with a three star. I'm going to head back and try out some other dishes in the near future and see if they can blow me away with anything from their menu.  Note: they did say that you can call your order in ahead of time for faster pickup, which is a nice option to have at a place like this."}
{"text":"Great food but don't like the wait times. Call ahead if you want something.  They do make it fresh to order so I do understand that it takes long. Price is fair and this place is great for lunch"}
{"text":"This place has been getting better and better.  To be honest I wasn't a fan but tonight the food was pretty good plus their rice is addictive.  Staff is super friendly and portions are huge! I usually get the falafel plate which is one of my faves.  Their meat dishes are good too.  I would definitely come back to eat here now that the quality of their food has improved in a huge way!_"}
{"text":"Recently retried their food after not going for a while (since there new management changed) and the food was delish! You get a lot of food for a reasonable price. The workers were very friendly. Not the greatest place to eat in, but great for take out! Don't forget...ask for extra garlic sauce! It's the best ;-)"}
