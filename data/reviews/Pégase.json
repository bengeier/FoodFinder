{"text":"This is one of the most amazing French restaurants in Montreal. Every time I bring a friend they were very satisfied with the dishes and services. This is bring your own wine restaurant which is amazing.  You can drink champagne or you favorites expensive wine with their excellent dishes the restaurant offers."}
{"text":"Went with 4 friends, and we shared quite a bit so I got to try most of the menu. The biggest problem across the board was the service. All our questions about the menu were answered with terrible one word answers, so we ended up with many dishes that were nothing like we expected. Best example...when I asked, \"What is the 'Stuffed Guinea Fowl Supreme?\" The first answer I got was, \"It's like a chicken.\" My next question, \"But what is it stuffed with? And what does the 'Supreme' mean?\" The response I got was simply, \"Dates\". That was pretty much how all our conversations with the waitress went. But terrible service aside, the biggest disappointment was the food itself. Nothing was necessarily BAD, but nothing was particularly GOOD or memorable either. They also seem to love their foam machine a little too much. While making cucumber foam, or pea foam is interesting, the textural element was used as more of a novelty than a compliment, as it was used on half the dishes. The meal ended appropriately. When asked, \"What's the 'Death by Chocolate'?\" The waitress responded, \"Mousse\". Turned out it was chilled and closer to ice cream. Overall I would have given the meal itself closer to a 3, maybe even 3.5...but such horrible service is inexcusable. They also did not open our wine until we asked, and they placed the white in a bucket, but with NO ICE! Unbelievable...There are far too many good restaurants in Montreal, especially in this price range to waste your time here. Nice ambiance though, the interior designer gets 5/5."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood gem; our party of 5 dropped in at 9pm, Sunday on the last night of our weekend away in Montreal, and despite that it seemed they would not be expecting any additional parties that night (and I believe they were a bit understaffed for the night but completely made up for it in hustle), they were able to seat us and we were so thankful they could. The food was exceptional and by far the best meal we had all weekend. BYOB balances the economics of the meal, taking the edge off of the splurge. I ordered the foie gras first and the rabbit main, and I'd go back in a heartbeat for them both. Pay close attention to the menu, the prices aren't as bad as they seem - they are all prix fixe."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants. Whenever I am in Montreal I plan a trip to this restaurant to stuff myself.  I go to the SAQ and stock up on some good quality wines and invite my friends. This is excellent quality food at very reasonable prices and deserve a good quality wine to match.  The filet mignon is the stuff of dreams, I have never had better. The appetizers are always interesting and just the right amount. The desserts are exquisite, the Mort de chocolat is orgasmic! In fact, just writing this makes me want to hop on the train to go back for another dinner. I really think this is one of Montreal's finest!"}
{"text":"Très bon service. Menu attrayant. Petit resto coquet et chaleureux. De plus, c'est apporter votre vin, c'est toujours un must."}
{"text":"I love BYOB places and they don't even charge you a \"cork\" fee here. Delicious 4 course meal (which is routinely updated) for about $60 pp after tax and tip.   It's a very small space (seating for approximately 30?) so reservations about a week in advance is needed. Because the space is small, be mindful of the two serving times on Fridays and Saturdays --6pm to 830pm-ish, or 9pm to close. So if you have reservations for 6pm and are running late, you still need to be out of there on time for the next service. Perfect for couples or small groups. Free street parking if you park a block or two away."}
{"text":"Excellent food, reasonable prices and relaxed atmosphere. The plates were generous. The service lovely and unintrusive.  We had a great meal, drank our own wine and will return often."}
{"text":"This was the first time visiting Restaurant Le Pegase and won't be the last. Their food and service was exceptional. Definitely worth a Michelin star in my book. Everything from the soup, salad, appetizer, main course and desserts were cooked perfectly, elegantly presented and full of amazing flavors. The bread, butter and pate were also great. Prices were reasonable for such an exceptional dinner. They have menus in both French and English."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time recently, everything was beautiful and delicious. The waitress was very nice, patient, and friendly. I had a dish with rabbit with pasta and chorizo sauce, and the whole thing was cooked to perfection. Everyone else in my party was also very pleased with their meals, and, of course, the delicious dessert of apple pie. Although the interior is not very spacious, the ambiance is lovely and comfortable. The restaurant is very unique and unlike anything else. A very nice experience overall, we'll be back."}
{"text":"First walked into the door that resembles to an entrance of a private home. Got stunned by the cozy little place, the relaxed ambiance, and the menu composed of limited selection but of high quality local produce. I ordered a breast of duck, slightly smoked and seared on the outside skin, napped with a reduction of cranberry pepper sauce. the side vegetables were also interesting. My husband, formerly my boyfriend back then, had a filet mignon. it was also delicious ."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant, if not #1!   Great food, friendly staff, bring your own wine, awesome atmosphere.   The menu is incredible! Try the deer tartare, it's a must! The beef filet mignon will just melt in your mouth, in an wonderful explosion of flavor. Take any (or every) desserts, they're all great!   Reasonable price for a foodie restaurant. Less than $100 for 2 people for 4 services, since you bring your own wine!"}
{"text":"Délicieux petit resto à essayer absolument. Service impeccable et souriant. Tarte tatin magique. Le tout est excellent."}
{"text":"A really really really good restaurant. Affordable (BYOB), excellent service, tasty food and nice atmosphere. What more could you want. 5 course meal that included app, main course, bread/butter/pate, dessert, coffee.   I had the rack of lamb - awesome."}
{"text":"One of the better BYOW restaurants in Montreal. The table d'hote includes a soup or salad,  entrée,  main dish,  dessert and coffee. The portions are quite generous and flavors or on point. The goat cheese profiteroles we're really original. Calamari was really fresh and paired nicely with the chorizo. Had the mahi mahi and it was yummy yummy :-) Came with a really flavorful risotto and some poached tomatoes. For dessert,  would strongly recommend the death by chocolate. Chocolate mouse,  extremely rich and sinful. Perfect end to a great meal. The place is small and very intimate. Perfect for a date,  special occasion or to have a great dinner with some friends. The prices are extremely reasonable for a four course meal, the quality of the food/service, the portion size, and the fact it is a BYOW. Will definitely be back and would strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant français, situé sur le Plateau, dans une petite maison blanche. De l'extérieur, sans y faire gaffe on le remarquerait même pas. C'est un apportez-votre vin, et les places sont limitées, donc je vous suggère d'appeler pour réserver. Bon choix pour une sortie en amoureux, ou en petit groupe. J'y suis allée plusieurs fois déjà, et tout dernièrement ce fut pour la fête des pères. Il est habituellement très difficile en terme de cuisine française, mais a été agréablement surpris, car tout fut délicieux. Et le service très attentionné, sans pour autant être envahissant. Vous aurez le choix entre la petite table (potage ou salade, plat et café) ou la table gourmande (potage ou salade, une entrée,  plat, dessert et café). J'y retournerai certainement et le suggère fortement."}
{"text":"Came here for my mum's birthday and it was amazing. From the outside it doesn't look the fanciest, I'd say even the decor inside isn't the best, that's the reason why I didn't give five stars. However, the food was just so good! It's a bit pricey for a college student but honestly, you get what you pay for. The quality is amazing!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal. Hard to remember all the details. Warm goat cheese salad was delicious. Bisons filet and veal for mains. Veal was just delicious. The desserts were creme Brule and the other was forgotten. Creme Brule was excellent. Suggested spot to have solid French food. Service was anything special but certainly not bad. Also, byow."}
{"text":"Wound up here completely by accident.  I can honestly say it's the greatest accident I've ever had.  Intimate atmosphere but lively, great service (didn't hold not speaking French against us) and the food was out of this world.  I would have paid double and still been happy.  Simply amazing.  It's byob so make sure to bring some wine! The foie gras is not to be missed."}
{"text":"We've dined here twice in 2 years.  We've love the French vibe and the service and food are incredible.  Also the prices are very reasonable, especially considering that the food is on par with Michelin starred places we've dined at."}
{"text":"Great place with classic French food.  I would highly recommend it for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"The best meal that I had in Montreal was at le Pegase.  I'm not going to reinterate what many reviewers said...I agree that the soup/salad is nothing special, but the rest of the meal is a total stand out.  Pay the upcharge for the fois gras.  If you're a fan, you'll never have a better experience with goose liver!  My husband got the filet, which was delicious, but the REAL DEAL, and the thing that set this place apart was the bison flank steak.  It was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Just WOW!  Desserts are sublime!  We all shared the creme brule, the apple tartin and the death by chocolate.  Each was a standout!    This place isn't cheap, but since it's BYOB, the check is a lot more reasonable.  Put it this way- you're getting a 5 star French dinner, for the price of a three star.  It was around $160 for three people, before tax and tip.  DO go with the gormet grand feast.  It's a bargain for a four course meal of this quality."}
{"text":"I don't know why I waited so long to come here... it was amazing!  What a romantic ambiance and gorgeous little spot. They have a tresses in the back as well just wasn't open last night because it was super hot and it's enclosed so it would be way to hot.  Service is impeccable, you are greeted once you walk in and once you leave they walk you to the door pretty thanking you for coming and to come back soon.  It's BYOW.. yes you read right BYOW! What a delicious treat I didn't think a place with food this good would be a BYOW but of course it is and it makes all the difference. Ice bucket brought right away for the champagne  cheers to that!!  I decided to do the table dhote, which comes with either salad or soup a entree and your main and dessert.  The food is out of this world. They really are good at matching what flavours blend together and not to over season or under season any of the veggies.  Started off with a mesclun salad with roasted red peppers dressing, very light but packed with flavour. It was more of a pure with oil. Very good!  Entrees were the escargot served with blue cheese on bone marrow.. so creamy and delicious must of been the best escargots I ever had. Next up was the foie gras served on a gingerbread brioche with pears. Melt in your mouth tasty. Last but not least was the Chèvre balls were awesome. Very light and packed with cheese. To die for. The main course was the veal and it was the chefs suggestion, it was served on veggies and a beet pure. Cooked to perfection, they added nut butter on top !  Lamb with 2 mustard sauce was something special and very juicy and tender. Fantastic meal. Dessert was cheesecake which was  a tia Maria cake very Creamy but not to rich just right. Best meal I've had in a while"}
{"text":"Excellent resto français aux mets finement préparés et délicatement savoureux. Il y a un bon choix d'entrées originales et toutes aussi bonnes les unes que les autres, ainsi que des plats divins. C'est un apportez votre vin en plus donc meme si les entrées et plats sont un peu plus chers qu'ailleurs (mais c'est normal pour la qualité..), on s'y rattrape au final avec le vin. L'endroit est assez petit ce qui le rend chaleureux. Excellent service. Avant de commencer, on vous apporte du pain (frais et sec) avec du beurre ainsi qu'une mousse de volaille vraiment excellente. Bref, je recommande ce resto si vous ne l'avez jamais testé, et moi j'y retournerai pour sûr!!"}
{"text":"Simple, well prepared food. Good atmosphere, good service. Heavier and more traditional than the meal we had at Bouillon Bilk the night before."}
{"text":"Last time I was here was about 7 years ago. I am so glad I came back. BYOB, great authentic homey French food, and lovely service. I hope to come back again next time I am in Montreal. If you are staying in the old port area, this is a 20 minute cab ride. I used Uber and it cost me about $12 each way."}
{"text":"It is very good. One of the best in French restaurant. I wish it has more variety on their menu. The rabbit is very good. Bring your wine."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Make a reservation and bring your best bottle of wine! From the grilled octopus and Israeli couscous / duck confit ravioli appetizers, to the grilled, marinated bison flank steak... This place has it all, ambience, five star service and an attention to classic French culinary detail that is rivaled by few.   Every part of our meal was perfect.. And with a five course pre fixe under $50.. How can you go wrong?  The staff was friendly and every single stage of the meal was perfectly executed.   We came here for our anniversary dinner and left with happy tummies and big smiles.  Thank you Le Pegase! :)"}
{"text":"I love these restaurants tucked in a residential neighbourhood that serve good food. Was not disappointed. Lots of local clients and non-pretentious. Bring your own wine and no corking charge.$15 uber ride from the downtown core so you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Le Pegase is perfect for a romantic date, or even a family gathering. This French restaurant sits on a quiet Mont Royal street, with little to call attention to itself save for the pegasus on its sign.  Everything we tasted satisfied, from the duck confit salad - drizzled with a lovely balsamic vinaigrette - to the duck with orange zest (C$40 total), the tender meat[1] done in a homey preparation. Pacing was ideal[2]: in-between courses we enjoyed the bottles of vino we toted in.  \"Merci bien\" to the friendly, accommodating service.  [1] What can I say? I love duck. [2] Seriously, when can I come here again?"}
{"text":"La Pégase has a surprisingly small, modest entryway which expands inside to include terrace dining out the back. Essentially it's the converted ground floor of a house on quiet Gilford Street.  My date and I chose terrace seating, and I'm glad we did because the noise level inside was very high. However, our seating for two was sandwiched in between two other, larger tables with extremely loud groups seated at them, so ultimately there was no escape from the *very* loud atmosphere. Don't dine here if you're looking for any sort of romantic experience. I don't even remember if there was any music playing or not, because my date and I could barely hear each other over the shouting around us.  There goes one star.  The food itself: You choose table â hote, or from a bigger menu option. Each option comes with coffee, but who drinks coffee at 9pm? Table â hote includes a soup or salad, the main meal, and coffee - no entrée (appetizer) or dessert. If you want those included, you choose the other option. My partner and I chose table â hote and to split an entrée à la carte.  He got soup, I got salad. The soup was super watered down, plain tomato soup that seemed to essentially just come out of a can. My salad was seriously nothing more than a handful of the mixed greens you buy in a plastic box at the grocery store, straight up. They didn't even bother to remove the slimy bits of spinach that had gone off.  Oh, you also get a little basket of bread with some chicken liver pâté that tastes like catfood with Dijon. Meow! Nothing remarkable so far, folks! However, I will openly declare that the main dish was SUPERB. Filet mignon that had a hint of caramel (my partner's choice) and was cooked to perfection, and yellow fish (in French, it actually translates to goldfish - hehe) which was crispy on the outside and also perfectly cooked on the inside. This is where the three stars come in for this review. Oh, we ordered a dessert as well - a  meille feuille (I can never spell or pronounce this name properly) with strawberries which was also divine.  The staff were really great, and even brought us English menus which made life a little easier. Very friendly people. The price is a bit up there but nothing outrageous! It's also BYOB, so that's nice. If the start of the meal was a bit more... caring... and the noise wasn't so out of control, this would have been a five star review. Alas. PS - I got reservations just a few hours before, on the same day. It's not that hard."}
{"text":"Good Golly Miss Molly! This French restaurant is Amazing! A triumph in French cuisine that stands alone IMHO as the undisputed champion in World class French cuisine. The food is so on point delicious and cooked to perfection. BYOW since they do not sell alcohol here. I saw many corks popping that evening.  The restaurant is located in a residential part of town. Parking in front of the place is difficult and spots that are available are only reserved for the local residents who live and have a permit to park there. There is plenty of parking on the main roads. A little advice use an Uber to come and go if you plan to knock down a few bottles of wine. The Uber prices in Canada are pretty reasonable.   The menu is simply laid out, you may need to turn on your flashlight on your phone, the lights are pretty dim here. We made reservations but walk in's are welcomed. They served us bread with butter and chicken liver pate' which was smooth and lush with flavor.  The veal was the recommended protein for the evening. So we ordered the veal, lamb chops and artic char which was the fish of the day. For our Entrees - we had the duck tartar, calamari/octopus, tomato soup and house salad. You have an option to choose the Gourmet menu in lieu of the table menu, the only difference is the gourmet is served with dessert and coffee as well.  The Awesome thing about eating with your immediate family, in this case my wife and son. I was able to sample everybody's food. The veal was cooked perfect and worked great with the beet puree as the base sauce. My lamb chops were prepared just right, medium and was tender and juicy with a two mustard sauce. The artic char was delicious as well, not over cooked and flavorful.   For dessert we had the death by chocolate and a hot chocolate lava cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which was a delicious hot mess. We finished up with a nice cup of cappuccino.   Overall a most righteous and delicious meal. We will definitely tell all our Family and friends to dine here. Great food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"While I was a bit taken aback by the Bring Your Own Wine thing (thankfully we realized that just before going there and stopped to get some wine on the way) I was extremely happy with everything else. The food was great as was the service. And unlike most French restaurants in California, portions are more than generous for a very affordable price! I may be wrong but I think it's located in a neighborhood you wouldn't necessarily go to as a tourist (my sister who lives in Montreal brought us there) but I would highly recommend going out of your way to try it out!"}
{"text":"We were a group of three and we all took the 'menu gourmande'.  Everyone loved the food.  I had the 'tartare de cheval' which was very tasty and generous.  As a main, I had the rabbit which was delicious.  The chicken liver paté served with the bread was amazing.  For desert, I tried 'Death by chocolate' which was rich and a little over the top but beautifully presented.  Overall, it was a memorable meal, fantastic byow find, and I will definetely return.  The service is friendly and attentive.  The only less positive comment I have is that a few of the menu items were not available and that was a little disappointing.  Otherwise, great experience!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp as it's just a couple of blocks from our AirBnb and were able to get a last minute reservation for Monday night. It's a very cute little spot with seating both in what appears to be the living room of the house and in a teeny covered courtyard in the back complete with heaters (though we did not need them at all on a July night). There are two menu options - a \"petite table\" that comes with a soup or salad with your main and the \"table gourmande\" for $12 more which also includes an appetizer and dessert. I ordered the gourmande and my husband took the petite and we split the extras. The bread basket came with both butter and a really good chicken liver pate. My husband had the sweet potato soup which he enjoyed, and I got the salad which was a bit on the bland side, just mesclun and vinaigrette.  For our appetizer, we chose the goat cheese profiteroles which came out piping hot, along with a beet mousse that was surprisingly tasty. The profiteroles were good but not particularly memorable. Our mains, on the other hand, were amazing. I ordered the night veal filet with sweetbreads which was on special that night. I'd tried sweetbreads once before and didn't see what the hype was about but these were tender and delicious, as was the veal. Probably the best veal I've ever eaten in my life. It was cooked perfectly, as was my husband's fish dish. The tarte tatin dessert was a little disappointing - more of an open apple pie than the french classic - but still delicious.  The service was impeccable and best of all, it's BYOB. A very reasonably priced, excellent meal. I'd go back again for sure."}
{"text":"I recently moved in the area and decided to try out some local restaurants. While on a walk, I came across this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised about the food's quality. This is a BYOW restaurant, so it is definitely a plus since there is a SAQ nearby. Moreover, they offer a tasting menu and not wanting to miss out on anything, I decided to go for it. I ordered the ravioli, the lamb and the chocolate mousse while my other half tried their joue de boeuf, their beef and the salty caramel dessert. Everything turned out to be delicious! I will definitely come back in the near future."}
{"text":"2nd time is a charm! Bisson, lamb, bone marrow with escargot were all delicious. Owner super cool. BYOW as a bonus. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Amazing little place hidden in a residential area. Their menu feels very fresh and seasonal and the plating and presentation is top notch. Service is courteous and friendly, and best of all it's a BYOB!! The portions are huge, especially if you get \"la table gourmande\" which includes soup or salad, an appetizer, a main course, and dessert with coffee or tea!  The lamb chops were amazing and everything on the plate complimented each other. I highly recommend this place if you're ever in the neighbourhood!! Note that it can get quite loud with the small interior space but I didn't mind it, the great food made the evening entirely worth it."}
{"text":"Not much I could say that hasn't already been said about this place, but it could be called a \"culinary experience\" unpretentiously, for sure. Make sure to pick up a bottle of \"vin\" beforehand though - this restaurant is BYOB."}
{"text":"One of my favorite \"bring your own wine\" restaurants in Montreal. It's a pretty old restaurant but has consistently served good food every time I've been there.  It can be hard to find parking here, as it's in an old house that's been converted to a restaurant in the middle of a neighborhood. I'd recommend parking on Mont Royal street and then walking to get there. It's easier than finding parking close by, and only five minutes walk.  The place makes you feel like you're home. There's a good ambiance and the staff is really friendly. They have just 2 options on their menu. The first is the table d'hôte, which includes a soup or salad, a main course of your choice, and a regular coffee or tea for a price between 27$-35$. For the bigger eater, there's the gourmet menu, which includes the same things as the table d'hôte, but adds an entrée and a dessert for 39$-47$.  Last time we were here, I had the fish of the day which was a cod with a spiced crust. The others I was with had the rack of lamb, stanstead rabbit, and guinea fowl stuffed with foie gras. I tried all of it, and everything was delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned. Everyone was happy about their choice and since you can bring your own wine, it's even better."}
{"text":"Such a cute, little French restaurant in Montreal! I came here on a Tuesday with a few family members and shared many bottles of wine. For dinner, I ordered the veal, which was amazingly tender and delicious!  I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in Montreal again."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a bit out of the way, but it's definitely worth discovering. The service is extremely friendly and the food was really tasty too. You could choose a 2 or 4 course service at different price points.  We started with a soup of the day or salad followed by an appetizer, main course and dessert. My crab ravioli was fantastic! It was rich and flavourful. On the other hand, my husband's snail flammekueche was pretty light. My fish of the day was a huge plate I could barely finish. My husband's bison plate was also spot on. For dessert, I really loved my husband's apple tarte tatin. My death by chocolate dessert was exactly as described; decadent and excessively chocolatey. We thought that the table d'hote was very worthwhile and the food was very well prepared. We would be happy to return in the future!"}
{"text":"Went with three friends. The food was so incredible that we had to return the following night. Amazing service, great atmosphere, ridiculously cheap. (They should charge more, 30% more, I'd pay it gladly!)  This should be a Michelin one star restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing... every single time I've gone, they have always been on point. They deliver thru and thru - delicious!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Terrace in the back  This old and charming house transformed as a Restaurant with a beautiful terrace out back Very interesting menu and not expensive at all One of the best BYOW i have ever visited .!!"}
{"text":"Opened for 27-28 years already. This cute little restaurant on the Plateau is worth the detour and the hassle to look for parking. When you get into the restaurant, it's like you are stepping into a private home. Cozy, warm and welcoming, i felt so at ease and couldn't wait to start my evening there!  I've been to this restaurant once before 10 years ago and if my memory is correct, love my experience a lot! It's a byob which is so pleasant and the cuisine is french. The food is fresh, comforting, delicious and very well prepared and cooked to perfection! The service is great. The waiters are very attentive to your needs and do all they can so you can enjoy your evening! You get two formulas at this restaurant. The first one consist of a choice of soup or salad, main and coffee. The second one consist of soup or salad, appetizer, main, dessert and coffee. It's a 12$ difference. I suggest going with the second choice.   I totally get why this restaurant is still up and running! Be sure to make reservations!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had in my life! Me and my SO were in Montreal for only a few days and I took him here on a date night. The restaurant just comes up when you're walking down the street and has nothing flamboyant on the outside except for a small sign on the door. It felt like I was just walking into an apartment, but once we walked in, the setup was really cozy and romantic. I didn't have a working phone in Montreal so made the reservations online, only to receive an email from Damien saying that they're closed on Mondays! He was very accommodating with our limited time in Montreal. Luckily I scored a reservation for Tuesday, although we had to sit outside on the back porch and it was a little toasty when we first got there.  We brought our own bottle of wine and as soon as we got there, we were greeted and our wine bottle was placed in a bucket of ice to be chilled. Since we didn't speak much French, we were provided with an English menu which was very considerate. We decided to go for the gourmet menu which was a five course meal. We were first given some fresh bread and dip and the meals came our much faster than we had expected. We got some soup, salad, grilled octopus, rabbit stuffed with snail, and bison. Everything was absolutely fabulous. The food tasted great, the service was super fast, and the ambiance was very pleasant. Having brought our own wine, the check was just a little over $100 and I think is absolutely worth the money for the taste and quality of food you get. If I ever go back to Montreal, I'll definitely be visiting Le Pegase again. This was definitely the best date night we've had so far. This place is a hidden gem and definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"A fantastic little place; everyone should have one of these in her neighbourhood.  This is why Montreal is the most attractive city in North America. A restaurant of this caliber is hardly noticed, it's normal.  In the ROC or the USA, it would the best place around and ridiculously pretentious and expensive.  Everything is good."}
