{"text":"We had an amazing experience. We went on a Friday night and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. This place is small. We ordered all but two of the small bites for the 4 of us. Every one was delicious. The short ribs and grits were perfect. The pork belly melted in my mouth with just the right amount of crunch! The pimento cheese and pretzels was so tasty I could have eaten the whole thing, luckily we were sharing :-) Brussels were on point and we got the strawberry cheesecake for dessert. I am normally not a sweets person but it was so good I couldn't stop eating it. This place has great prices. The food tastes amazing and the service was excellent! We will definitely be back soon. We want to try the breakfast and brunch!"}
{"text":"Anytime a restaurant undercooks food I will ALWAYS give the least amount of stars possible - hence the explanation of my rating. Went there to flipside cafe for lunch and had the mac and cheese meatloaf and it was EXTREMELY DRY...PARTIALLY UNDERCOOKED & 100% TASTELESS...During lunch, this place is usually overcrowded and loud. Not sure why people flock here when the food is unimpressive and not cheap. Simply put...I do not recommend the flipside cafe."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to take my wife for breakfast there. When you walk in, you can feel the casual atmosphere. The waitress came with a smile and welcomed us to sit anywhere. Looking through the menu, I noticed the $5 breakfast special of two eggs, grits, biscuit, and gravy. (Monday-Friday only). Everything I wanted except for the grits so I substituted it for bacon for just $0.50 more. Oh yeah!  My wife got the same but substituted grits for potatoes. Just look at the pictures. The food was made from scratch and delicious. The gravy had onion which gave it an extra sweet taste. The potatoes were crispy on the outside and tender in the inside. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Lets see, locally used organic fresh ingredients with 2 business owners that met in the industry and have a combined 30 yrs. in the kitchen! I'm a foodie, so off i go to Flipside Cafe, btw its only been open 1 week! So I originally wanted to have Breakfast/Brunch, but I was told that it was lunchtime. So I stayed and had lunch, WOW!!!! I didn't expect to be knocked off the proverbial ladder. I had the special, BBQ Chicken Sandwich and Pan Roasted Potatoes. It didn't appear to be much as the chicken and the ingredients seemed to have gotten lost inside that AWESOME BUTTERY/GARLIC BRIOCHE BUN. Wait for It-- Flavor City 101!! In the time I was there I witnessed a very new business owner, Amy, I didn't get a chance to meet Jon, run the front of the restaurant w/ tireless enthusiam. Out of the 7 people, including myself, these were the items ordered: 3 Chicken Sandwiches, 1 Hamburger, 1 Open Faced Turkey Plate, 1 Turkey Chili, and 1 Shrimp (Soy)Chorizo and Grits. Everyone was asked how they enjoyed the food, and the overall consensus was on par w/ my opinion. Thumbs Way Up, Awesome, The Best I've had, one person just shook their head and gave Two Thumbs Up. Bravo Flipside Cafe, you're on the way to a bigger location, sooner than expected! My name is D'Shawn and will definitely be going back to visit!"}
{"text":"We had dinner shortly after they opened in December and lunch last weekend.  Chef Amy checked on us on both visits and we liked the food very much but they really need to step up the service.  We've tried the chicken & pasta, meatloaf, mushroom empanadas, tomato soup, turkey chili, potatoes bravas and open faced turkey.  The food is very good, they have a limited menu but they do things well, portions are just right.  The service the 1st visit was spotty, I understand they were newly opened and still working out the details but last weekend the server was not at all friendly and the only server.  I can appreciate that fact that she could have been stressed since the place was pretty full but that's no reason to take it out on the customers.  She didn't refill drinks and kept trying to take our plates & glasses when we were not finished.  I'll probably be back if we are in the area and they receive their alcohol license."}
{"text":"I went with a friend for brunch on Memorial Day- the restaurant was busy and there was only one server. Courtney did a great job of taking care of us and being pleasant even though she was running around like crazy. The food was fantastic! I ordered the soy chorizo and potato hash and my friend ordered the shrimp and grits. I would highly recommend both! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"August 23, 2014
My wife, Son, Daughter-in-law and two grandchildren experienced the Flipside
and came away with glowing reports of the food and the service.  We all enjoyed
the food and my steak was really tasty.  The waiter was really friendly and helped
get some powered medicine for my grandson in a lemonade.  We will return!

{"text":"First place I went to eat when moving to Fort Mill from NYC one year ago. Delicious food and amazing menu. The staff was very friendly and inviting. I have returned several times since and I can't wait to share it with my family when they come to visit."}
{"text":"Love they renovations made at this location.  The servers here are always welcoming.  The coffee here is the absolute best.

My only complaint is that the pancakes on the menu recently changed and are no longer as good as they used to be.  The new recipe does not seem to have enough leavening, so the texture feels a bit off.  The pancakes were the main reasons we came here on a regular basis so hoping to see the old pancakes added back to the menu so that we can start coming back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that we haven't been here sooner! This adorable cafe is everything Fort Mill needs. The flavors were on point and everything cooked to perfection. This is the cafe I've been waiting for. The service was great and friendly. The pimento cheese is delicious, complex, and real. Real ingredients adding up to a really amazing meal."}
{"text":"Dined twice last week. First, was breakfast on a weekday.  Liked it so much we went back for the brunch on Sunday.  Great meal and very friendly atmosphere.  Looking forward to having lunch sometime soon.  Will definitely be going back for brunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food, the people, the atmosphere, everything! The hardest thing is to have to choose just one delicious item from the menu!"}
{"text":"Cute neighborhood cafe with food from local farms/businesses. Server was very friendly! Not much room to sit, but Food was tasty! The sausage biscuit & gravy was awesome!! Will definitely come again :)"}
{"text":"yes its small, yadda, yadda, but the food was really good. Amy was sweet and try shepherds pie or salmon. will return again."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite. Large breakfast portions. Very nice clean small storefront restaurant. Farm to fork. Great local eggs this place is the real deal. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this morning was quite a disaster. I ordered the \"The Flipside Breakfast\" and wished I ordered it hot.  The biscuit, grits, and coffee were luke warm. I informed my waitress and she served me another bowl of disappointing grits. Apprehensive of receiving an additional bowl of grits with a secret ingredient of snot, I walked away unimpressed.  Oh, she did not even offer to reduce the cost.  Just wished the server was more accommodating and the food, HOT!"}
{"text":"For good food and great service, this place is a must. I highly recommend the lobster omelette and blueberry pancakes."}
{"text":"The food is well prepared using quality ingredients by a dedicated new owner and chef.  The atmosphere could use a little help, but the food and cooking talent is exactly what Fort Mill needs.  The meat loaf  isn't the norm; it's excellent."}
{"text":"My family and I arrived around 11am. I didnt expect a long wait as we were told the wait time was approx 20 minutes.. well that wasnt the case. Flipside Cafe is rather small, seating is available outside but in 90 degree weather, waiting a single minute would make wait to leave. We were seated after a 45 min wait.
Smaller groups were sat before us and that pissed me off! The hostess was apologetic and made up for the long wait. I ordered the shrimp and grits. Was just okay BUT she brought my mimosa in a larger glass. My son ordered the pancake. Suggested if he didnt like them she would allow him to order something else free of charge. Another relative ordered the Lobster omlette. She wasnt pleased with taste as the seafood overpowered the other ingredients. Before bringing out the check she brought her the shrimp and grits!! I thought that was a really nice gesture.. I will recommend ordering the small plate grits. Full of flavor!"}
{"text":"Jason the waiter was fantastic  we were say that on a Thursday night after making reservations 2 hrs before very promptly.  Seems to be a hidden gem. Small menu that is seasonal. Food was very flavorful. Main dishes could have been warmer. We all ordered something diffetent and everything was good. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided we should try Flipside!  The reviews mentioned that they use local produce and farms.  Reason 1!   Reviews also stated how clean and delicious everything is.  I made reservations because I wanted to make sure we did not have a wait .   I had to call back because one person in our party was stuck in traffic.  Courtney was understanding and moved our reservations.   We were greeted by Courtney and gave us a choice of two tables.  It was a great experience from the questions we had about menu to the dessert!   I highly recommend this place.   Thank for a wonderful meal and giving us time to visit with our VIP."}
{"text":"We have been there twice now, first time for dinner with kids and second time I went with a friend. The first occasion my big bugbear was that they seated us at a six top pub table with a baby in a high chair. My daughter just had a fab view of everyone's knees. Ordered Ravioli (great) Asparagus salad with a fried egg on top (I dream about it)  and the old man got a meatloaf (he wasn't a fan, but he thinks that  he just ordered the wrong thing). 
Returned yesterday for lunch and I had the turkey chilli and the asparagus/egg/greens thingy again friend had the chilli and a warms greens salad. The chilli could have been a little hotter, but that asparagus salad is sooo good, I forgave that immediately. great little spot and a wonderful addition to our little town!"}
{"text":"We're from Austin, TX where we have a reputation for delicious food. Flipside Cafe made us feel like we were right at home. Simple, delicious farm to table offerings and a friendly atmosphere. Definitely try to Carolina Grits, which are literally incredible. This will be a regular spot for us when we're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant.  It is small and quaint, but I would imagine it could feel crowded very easily.  There are a couple tables for two and they are small-not really a lot of room for anything extra on the table.  With that being said, the decor is adorable and it has a real \"date night\" feel to it.  
The menu had everything I love in it-locally sourced food, a \"farm to table\" approach.  We loved our dinner and felt like there was a lot of thought put into the menu selection.   The service was great-our server was very attentive and polite.  This is definitely a restaurant I would visit again, especially if they were on some kind of points program like Hilton Honors Dining."}
{"text":"I truly want to like this restaurant and might like it better for dinner.  I will admit I have high expectations of any establishment I go to.  All 3 times I have gone here have been for breakfast and it is just disappointing.  This time was a weekday and the menu was a little lacking.  I ordered a 2 egg omelet with spinach, tomato and feta.  No feta was available so I went with cheddar.  Also requested whole wheat toast.  I received an omelet  much larger than 2 eggs  and with 3 small tomatoes,(spinach was perfect)  and white toast that was barely toasted.  So the food was not up to my standards or what I ordered.  My other criticism is the decor or messiness.   They need some help with this.  Seats are not comfortable or inviting, all of the counters are just messy and need or organization.  Walls are chipped up and needing attention and the lighting is just too bright.   So the decor has always made me avoid going there for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"So glad we were finally able to eat here.  Seating is somewhat limited due to space and each time we tried in the past it was too long to wait.

The food was truly delicious and unique.  My wife had an Alfredo dish that had red chilies and kale, neither of which I would have thought would be in a pasta Alfredo.  My steak was cooked as ordered and had a slight butter sauce on it with a unique taste.  We really enjoyed the tomato salad and especially the rhubarb cheesecake."}
{"text":"After popping into this place to get a couple iced Americano's, I left feeling cheated and over-charged.  The gal was sweet, but she had no idea what an Americano was.  I had to tell her how to make it.  How do you have an espresso machine and serve Counter Culture coffee and not know what an Americano is?  This is a management issue.  Also, she ended up charging me for each shot she put in the drinks.  I walked out having paid almost $14 for two iced Americanos.  I can get two iced Americanos (Counter Culture) at Dean and Deluca for $8...and I don't have to tell them how to make the drink.

I'd love to go back and try their food, but after this experience it might be impossible on principle alone."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Had a set of dudes next to me complain about literally everything, and the server was still super nice to them! Great job!"}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service. Bring your patience. Try the blueberry waffle but make sure you get the citrus whipped cream that is supposed to come on it because mine was brought out without it and I had to wait ten minutes for my server Courtney to bring it,  by which time my waffle was cold but still tasted yummy. Cheers to the chefs, servers could use a little updating"}
{"text":"Run don't walk to this restaurant!  Can't wait to try it for brunch and dinner.  Pimento cheese, chopped salad and Five Buck Chuck burger are delish!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  Have went there several times and have enjoyed the food.  The burger at lunch is great...just get there before noon"}
{"text":"Quick update: the service issues are much better. Great friendly new faces in there lately :-)"}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad. I came here for breakfast and everything was good. The biscuit and gravy is definitely the highlight, but their eggs leave something to be desired. At the end of the day it's a nice breakfast place."}
{"text":"Courtney's customer service skills more than compensated for the lack of Puckerbutt hot sauce that we got last time we visited. This place is worth a trip to a random strip mall. The special is $7 and worth every penny. Grits are outstanding and the eggs were cooked perfectly. Go. Tomorrow."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! One of the most delicious brunches I have had in a while. The pimento cheese grits were soooo good. Everything was well cooked and seasoned and fresh. Their brewed coffee was some of the best I have had at a diner. Heard from a regular that lunch is a great choice too."}
{"text":"Flip Side is ok at best. It's a middle of the road trendy restaurant. The atmosphere is great, a small local restaurant using local vendors. Respect there. This is a great place, the food just does not do it for me. It's far from nasty but nothing stands out to me. I ate breakfast and lunch there. I will try it one more time to see if I can find that gem on the menu. I over heard the Smores French Toast may be a hit."}
{"text":"Wow, was really surprised at the quality of the experience here.  This is a restaurant you have to visit before the crowds find it.  Had a delightfully delicious dinner.  Best Lobster Bisque I've had in the south.  Enjoyed the meal so much, went back for breakfast.  Incredible grits.  Great farm to table.  Get there before you have to wait on line!"}
{"text":"I happen to like this place a lot. The chef uses local foods and he has perfected the taste of the food but why wouldn't he lol they never change the menu it's always the same and really that's all I'd change in this place get some new menu items once in a while and you would see your return customers much more often. 
Brunch is a very fun time here so I would recommend you try that for sure"}
{"text":"Service was attentive and efficient.  Food was fresh and delicious. I ordered the waffles and fruit and my husband ordered the flip side special and we were both are very impressed and pleased with the quality and taste of the food."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! I had heard great reviews on food and the reviews were right on target. I got the Lobster omelet which was fantastic! And, the coffee was excellent also.

However, the wait was 30 mins with no waiting area so we had to wait outside in the cold. When our name was called, we were in the car so we had to wait an additional 10 mins. Instead of apologizing for the wait, a waitress yelled across the restaurant AT US for not being present when our name was called. How unprofessional! Not sure if the food is worth the poor service!"}
{"text":"The Flipside is definitely a Fort Mill favorite for me!  The food is always amazing breakfast, lunch AND dinner.  They serve the best quality local ingredients that you can taste it in every dish.  I think I have tried almost everything on their menu, so it is awesome they change it occasionally and offer specials.  

I bring my family and friends here constantly because they have food to please every palate.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Such amazing food!!!!! Love their palmetto cheese grilled cheese with fried green tomatoes! Also, their chicken salad sandwich is outstanding. I'm not big on chicken salad, but they put bleu cheese in theirs & I'm a sucker for bleu cheese. They also use all natural products and veggies."}
{"text":"I would like to give it more stars because I enjoy the food, but the service as well as the food I had were both bad. I ordered what I thought was a white chicken chili... It was a bowl of greasy broth with a few pieces of shredded chicken and one or two tortilla strips. It was terrible! The server who took my order was very rude, and I almost left without ordering. I have read other reviews saying that the wait staff is rude. It will be a long time before I go back."}
{"text":"Greatest breakfast and lunch spot in Fort Mill.  We've become regulars since discovering its proximity to our office.  We've sampled almost everything on their menu and all of it is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Brunch = amazing! Definitely one of the more unique restaurants I've visited in the greater Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Flipside and eat here often. Tonight was not a good night. Met friends here.  I ordered the Wahoo special. It came out way undercooked and I had to send it back.  I've never had to do that at this Resturant. My friends ordered a glass of wine and the glass came with only a very small amount of wine. The waitress did take their glasses back and add some wine.  On one of my friends Salmon dish, she could t find potatoes and had lots of artichoke hearts.  The other one had all potatoes and no artichoke hearts. I left a good part of my food and cane home and half a peanut butter sandwich.  Let me say once again, this isn't the Flipside that I have grown to love and one if their frequent customers. This was an off night and I know if you go, you'll love it.  We love brunch here."}
{"text":"\"Small, quaint cafe serving fresh quality food!\"

First let me ask... when was the last time you were in a small café with a fresh produce case in the dining area that had AT LEAST 6 pounds of fresh asparagus and probably 6 heirloom tomato varieties on display? 

What kind of café uses up 6 pounds of fresh asparagus before it spoils? Answer: an outstanding little café with a gourmet menu! 

The ambiance of Flipside comes up a bit short... it's location is tiny and has limited seating (probably under 30) so it cannot be called fancy. Flipside is very clean and maximizes the space available, and the staff is friendly and strives to make your dining experience amazing. The young couple that owns Flipside came to Ft. Mill following their dream of owning a small café serving excellent food! 

They have succeeded in creating some FANCY FARE at wallet friendly prices! A tender prepared-to-your-order strip steak that is sure to please. There is also a roasted salmon that is fabulous! The two most expensive menu items are less than $20. The Flipside Melt is very good with some creative surprises. Open seven days a week Flipside offers breakfast (lobster omelet?), lunch, and dinner... and brunch (lobster quiche w/asparagus?) on Sunday 10AM-2PM! 

There is a limited beer and wine offering that complements the menu with something for everyone. The Flipside Cafe has been here a while, but only recently did we hear of it! Right on the beaten path between Charlotte and Ft. Mill just north of the intersection of Regent Parkway... and passed by numerous times unnoticed until a friend recommended that we try it Note: Parking is BEHIND the two buildings in the complex fronting along US 21... access the parking lot between the buildings and enter the café from the parking lot side."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Best one I've ever had! The $5 special is awesome! Can't rave about this place enough - especially since they support local farms and shops! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very, very, good breakfast. Service was friendly and competent. My only slight negative is that the seating is a bit tight. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Promptly seated with attentive service. The benne benne was great. Omelette was amazing."}
{"text":"Super spot to stop outside Charlotte right off I77 open daily for breakfast lunch 
Brunch till 1 on Saturdays and all day Sunday Fresh local food love it!"}
{"text":"Loved the casual atmosphere and didn't at all feel rushed.  Great food and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I've been to Flipside about 5 times now and every visit my meal was excellent. The meal prices and portions are very reasonable. One of the best breakfast places around."}
{"text":"If I lived in Fort Mill, The Flipside would be my go-to morning spot.  Locally sourced ingredients always get a thumbs up from me.

Onward...to the food:

Buscuit and gravy.  I've had better buscuits, but the gravy was out of this world.  I wish I could remember the type of sausage they used in the gravy, but it tastes similar to an Andouille gravy.  

The grits were like no grits I've ever had.  I wouldn't have known they were grits if they weren't labeled as grits.  These were the cheesiest I've ever had...and they had the consistancy of mashed potatoes or a thick rice.  Very, very, very tasty.

The bacon is a bit different than the store bought bacon I'm used to.  Good, but different.

The eggs are really where The Flipside wins me over.  I normally like my eggs over-easy, but decided to take a stab at their scrambled.  Making an over-easy egg is easy...but scrambling eggs is an artform.  They nail em here.  Slowly cooked on low heat and not overcooked.  A+

The inside is a handful of tables and a couple of taller ones with stools.  Nothing all that exciting, but it's tastefully decorated and the simplicity is what makes it so nice.  It's small, but not a hole-in-the-wall.  


Try:  Everything I mentioned (the meatless chorizo is pretty nice too)"}
{"text":"Steak was dry.  Sent it back and got short ribs, which were good.  Pimento mac and cheese was okay. Overpriced with decent service."}
{"text":"Too expensive for breakfast.  I will admit they have excellent grits. But scrambled eggs are the same everywhere. It came with a biscuit & gravy but the biscuit was dry with no flavor. Good coffee. Then the bill came. $8.60!  I'll stick with waffle house or the Ft Mill family rest."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant   the foid was fabulous and the severe was great. A favorite place to ho now. Wish they had little more of a drink selection. But that wouldn't keep me from going!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoy breakfast here!  A little crowded but they make good use of the space. Bacon is really really good, so are the potatoes and grits. You really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Service was great!  Everyone was warm and welcoming. Best shrimp and grits I've ever had. Chicken and waffle dish was also delicious. Would definitely come again next time I'm in SC."}
{"text":"Went to the Flipside recently for a business lunch with a colleague and was quite impressed. There were quite a few things on the menu that I would like to try including several BLTs, some really nice salads and burgers. I chose the crabcake BLT and it was very tasty, served on a nice brioche roll with excellent seasoned french fries. One thing I notice about good restaurants is the attention to detail. The french fries were piping hot just out of the fryer instead of cool and limp like you get a lot of places. My colleague had the kale Caesar salad with grilled chicken and he commented that the chicken was very juicy and not dried out like is often the case. The service was attentive and I would definitely return. My one complaint was that the men's bathroom was shockingly dirty and in serious need of repair.   The floor hadn't had a good cleaning in quite some time and the walls were filthy and needed a good cleaning and a coat of paint. Also the toilet seat was loose and the soap dispenser was not secured properly to the wall. The dining room was clean but the condition of the restroom makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"The coastal catch is a must try.  A hidden gem of fort mill. Staff is very knowledgeable on the menu. Worth a stop in!  Make sure to ask for Megan!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim and I'm sooo glad we did! The buscuit bakes are insanely delicious!!! I have no idea how they make the bacon so crispy and sweet, the gravy was delectable and the eggs were just PERFECT! Our little ones enjoyed their waffles and fresh fruits, the omelet we ordered was divine as well. I would recommend they clean their restroom doors but otherwise it's GREAT!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch after shopping at cabelas on a Saturday. Went here based on Yelp reviews, glad we did.  Place is small, but their new expansion is almost done.  We had the fried green tomato blt, amazing on thick toasted bread with a white cheddar on it. Served with broasted potatoes.  Really good.  Also had the squash soup with pumpkin seeds and a bit of fig jam. So good. Everything is farm to fork and they list farms used on their chalkboard.   Service was attentive and food was served on time.  Will def be back.  Can't wait to try dinner there."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast at this restaurant.  The lobster in the Maine Lobster omelet was tough and rubbery.  The food tasted only okay.  The coffee was overpriced considering the quality.  About 20 minutes after leaving the restaurant both my friend and I felt sick.  Too much grease.  The meal for two cost over $31.  You're better off going to IHOP so that you don't pay too much money for mediocre food.  Avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!! My first time and i will return!!! Had the chicken and waffles. Chicken was well seasoned along with potatoes"}
{"text":"This place is a winner in my book!  First let me start of saying the service was just wonderful :) I cant remember my servers name :( but she was so kind and really listened and made appropriate suggestions. 
I ordered the classic breakfast and it came with a biscuit with gravy, eggs, grits and bacon. My sister had the shrimp and grits the shrimp were huge and the sauce was tasty. Another plus is nothing on the menu is over $15. Mimosa's are $5 on weekday and $3 on the weekends. you cant beat that."}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with everything. The service was very friendly and the food was outstanding. I can't wait to go back and try more items because it was clear that the chef had incredible talent."}
{"text":"I went for dinner on a friday night, just my husband and I.. We were in the area and had heard about Flipside being a fresh, new restaurant that served food from local farms and thought we would try it. We walked in to a tiny little cafe, with randomly sized tables scattered everywhere.. Some full of people, some dirty, and some empty. There wasn't a hostess stand.. just a stack of menus on the nearest counter and someone from across the cafe greeted us and told us we could seat our selves. 
  There were a lot of different size tables and all very close together.. We chose a 2 top near the cafe counter and looked at the menu that only had food listed on it. No drinks anywhere. Nor was any of the meals described in much detail.. Just... Meat + Sides + Price. The Waitress came by took our drink and food orders.. She returned with drinks, but no silverware... I snagged my own set from an abandoned table next to me ( it was so close, I didn't even need to stand up ) The food took a pretty long time to come out.. and in the meantime we watched as random people trickle in and seated themselves, and  our lone waitress serving them all while other people working in the cafe bringing plates of food out awkwardly, and having to maneuver themselves thru the tables and serve people.. It was weird and seemed really unprofessional.
 Finally my food came.. It was good, nothing to complain about! I had BBQ Half Chicken, with Spinach and Mac N Cheese.. Once I was done, we inquired more about the ingredients and technique to prepare the food and the waitress had no idea what to tell us.. She repeated what was listed on the menu and then came back later to offer us slightly more info about the BBQ sauce having honey in it..?  It was laughable, but no harm done.. My final opinion of the Flipside cafe would have to be that its just TRYING too hard to be something It can't. Maybe Breakfast or lunch is better? But trying to eat Dinner in such a cramped space, with \"gourmet\" prices and untrained/casual service is backwards and confusing."}
{"text":"An awesome place for breakfast any day of the week.  My wife and toddler like to do breakfast dates there.  Great biscuits and gravy, and a good selection of kids options. They also do a great cup of coffee if you're passing through on the way to work.

If you can get a seat on the weekends, their dinner menu is lights out!

Awesome to have a place like this in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"Great food.  Very clean.  Nice server.  They cared about presentation and quality.  Casual atmosphere.  Late dinner yet treated very welcome.  Large portions, prices ok."}
{"text":"All of the food was amazing!! It was evident it was fresh and made with care. We were visiting from out of town and will certainly return when we visit again. Great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was even better. Two lunches with water to drink came to less than $20 (without tip).  

Nonetheless, I'd give Flipside a 3.5 if I could. It's just so claustrophobia inducing inside. The interior design seems very haphazard. Yes, I realize it is a small space and there is only so much you can do, but still...  I just don't feel relaxed in a restaurant when I'm practically knocking elbows with the next table. Not to mention that you can see much of the storage of food, dishes, etc from the dining area. The large prep area feels very cluttered and unorganized.  A food delivery truck arrived while we were there and so that provided entertainment, because you can see everything.  I don't know, if you are looking for a relaxing meal with a little privacy on the side, Flipside isn't for you. I have heard that the Rock Hill location is much larger and more comfortable so I think I will go there, as I did really enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Went by on Sunday and it was busy as usually. Left our number with the hostess and she texted to give us a heads up 5 minutes before our table was ready. We were then greeted by Jerri, our server who made the afternoon for us. The food was great and I highly recommend it along with asking for Jerri's section."}
{"text":"Pimento cheese hamburger is awesome!! I am not a fan on pimento cheese normally. This was so good it made me change my mind."}
{"text":"Had a hankering for pancakes and SOS (biscuits and gravy) so onward to the Flipside. This place is cute quaint place that gives it a cozy home feeling.  We were immediately greeted.  We had already called in our order but after seeing this place,  definitely going to eat there next time. Although the female on the phone said it would be 10 minutes the food was not ready when we arrived 25 minutes later which I thought was odd. 

The food looked delicious and I like that they had the gravy separated to keep the biscuits from being soggy by the time we got home. The Carolina grits were very tasty.  They are a must have. Loved the bacon jam.  Biscuits were good however the gravy was rather unremarkable. Pancakes were sweet and liked that the syrup was not cold.  Fresh fruit is always a nice touch. I gave a 3 as the food overall was not what I expected based on their high reviews. Only the grits made an impression,  everything else tasted like any other breakfast place.   

Staff was friendly and genuinely happy to help and be there. We are planning to return to sample their dinner menu and I will update my review then."}
{"text":"Very underwhelmed by breakfast this morning. The lobster omlette was such a letdown. Very low quality lobster: salty, briney and chewey. I had to eat around it. Breakfast potatoes were meh, and coffee was lukewarm and very weak. I definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! I had 2 apps: pimento cheese with pretzels and brown butter ravioli. I can't say enough good things about the pimento cheese. My husband had the salmon and loved it. Everything was delicious. Great atmosphere and helpful staff. Plan on coming back with friends for dinner."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. The staff is very friendly and helpful. 

The omelette was definitely over cooked and the eggs of the couple next to us had to send theirs back. So with that being said I would stay away from the egg portion or ask them to not over cook. 

Also my friend got chicken and waffles and stated they were alright. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Great food! Only complaints is that it is small and this creates a long wait time. Awesome food though!"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this little gem and we frequent it a lot for breakfast. My favorite is the Steak & eggs and the potatoes are so awesome"}
{"text":"Smoked bacon, cheddar, and poblano pepper omelette was delicious. Packed with flavor yet not too dense for what is generally a greasy dish at other breakfast joints. Good atmosphere, decent coffee, and fresh local \"farm-to-table\" food. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Salmon salad was phenomenal and pimento grilled cheese should be illegal it's so good. Didn't get to try the grits but they won \"best grits in Charlotte\" so they are probably pretty awesome."}
{"text":"This place is way over priced and you only get a small amount of food.  The food wasn't bad but it was nothing special either.  I got the shrimp and grits and only got 4 shrimps and maybe a cups worth of grits and it didn't come with a drink! All for $15, for lunch.  No thanks, I'll never go back. I'd add a picture if I knew how."}
{"text":"The Flip side is awesome. Came a while ago when it was small with a limited menu, enjoyed it then but it's better now. Now it's on steroids with more menu options, expanded seating and a bar. You'd never expect it to be so great hidden in a little strip mall but don't let the simplicity fool you. Burgers are great! Especially with the Bacon jam. And my favorite is the Bacon Balsamic Brussel Sprouts. This place is a jewel."}
{"text":"As usual, everything was fantastic!  I branched out and ordered different items this time.  I went with a friend and we had a blast. For starters, my friend and I shared the Flipside Brussels, which were so good that I plan on getting them as my meal the next time I go.  She had the Flipside BLT, and I had the smoked salmon salad. Delicious!!!  And the bottle of Nobilo Sauvignon blanc wine that we shared was great.  Topping it all off was our fantastic waiter, Jon Michael!  It was a fun lunch that will always be remembered."}
{"text":"The food is DELICIOUS! I have been several times and have gotten something different each time. Every time I am blown away by the flavors! The pimento cheese appetizer is sensational! Only \"bad\" thing is, they are so popular that you can't just walk in, sometimes it is by reservation. It's a good and bad problem. I hope they get a larger location in Ft. Mill."}
{"text":"This place is great. Local and made from scratch. I was here last June for breakfast and HAD to come back on my return trip to town. The Flipside Breakfast is affordable and plenty of food. The Carolina Grits are one of the best things I have ever eaten. Sylvia was my server again today and remembered me from June. She is knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Service was really poor despite two people waiting tables. We had to ask for attention repeatedly.  A first cup of coffee was difficult to obtain as were refills. The bacon wasn't fully cooked I sent it back and the returned with what appeared to be the same undercooked bacon. The whole grain pancakes were mushy and unexceptional. We hope to find better breakfast offerings."}
{"text":"One of the best places to have breakfast in the Charlotte area. 

Amazing grits and the service was perfect. 

I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place and so happy they now have more sitting available at the Ft Mill location. Beware though, if you go on Saturday you can't order off of the lunch menu until 1pm... after they finish the brunch menu.  If you order the meatloaf get some extra gravy because it is soooo good. The meatloaf mac & cheese is also delish."}
{"text":"We came for Brunch today for my late Mothers Day Lunch......It started out great w/the wine and appetizer...It took an HOUR for our food and when it arrived we were very disappointed.....Also we had to ask for H2O and a COMP on our food and got major ATTITUDE was blamed on the computer by waitress.....Plus they had only 2 servers and that can hurt your Business.....Service.....ETC....."}
{"text":"OK....I forgot to check-in this place but man o man is this place what every food establishment should be like!!!

The lady helping us that morning was super nice, think she was the owner, and went above and beyond to make sure our experience was wonderful and it was!!!

I had to SOY Chorizo dish and it was OUTSTANDING!!!!

Wish it was around me where I live!!! Will for sure go back when in town again!!!"}
{"text":"BRUNCH: The Patatas Bravas and the appetizer grits (with pimento cheese and bacon jam) were two of the best items I've eaten in a long time. The potatoes were beautifully crispy, perfectly seasoned and the herbed creme fraiche was literally icing on top. I don't particularly care for grits, but these are no ordinary grits. They're light and fluffy with body like nice mashed potatoes. No drippy, runny grits here. The flavor was superb as well. If only I'd stopped there...

The brunch entrees were a bit underwhelming. After the amazing appetizer potatoes, the SOY CHORIZO POTATO HASH was disappointing. While it was perfectly adequate, the potatoes weren't nearly as good as of as the Patatas Bravas.  And the 2 sunny side up eggs were cooked through (not runny yellow, as sunny side up indicates).   The BENE BENE eggs were also overcooked (solid all the way through), and the asparagus was a bit dried out (maybe also overcooked?). 

Despite the lackluster entrees, the appetizers would have been enough for a 5 star review, except for two problems.

1) there were not enough servers to adequately serve the amount of patrons, resulting in significantly substandard service.  Our server was very nice, when he was at our table. But somehow my water was always empty and it was 15 minutes before we'd see him the next time. Which is weird, because the restaurant is so small that I could see him whenever I looked, but I think he was too busy to make it to our table regularly. 

2) the biggest problem was the temperature in the restaurant. It was exactly the same inside as outside, and it was at least 85 out. I read this in a previous review, so I know it wasn't unique to our experience. I was literally sweating down my face by the time entrees came. I had the server immediately box up my entree so I could get out as quickly as possible. I could've overlooked all of the other issues and strongly recommended this place based on our appetizers, but the heat was too much.

Owners: please turn up the a/c for a more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Great grits and biscuits are a notch above most ! Always crowded but food comes out quite quickly...eggs are done perfectly no matter how you like them and portions are quite large."}
{"text":"Kind of small.  It is what you should expect for a breakfast diner.  Coffee is okay. Service is okay.

The Grits. Beyond words. I simply don't have the ability to describe them. I can only tell you that they must be on your food bucket list."}
{"text":"Flip side is one of our favorite spots. The food is always delicious and the service is excellent. LOVE their salads and seafood. Yum!!!
Pam Gibbes"}
{"text":"This place was great! The service was awesome and it was the best breakfast I've ever had. Highlight recommend this place."}
{"text":"So this place has literally been under my nose for a while. Ridiculous I know but live 2 miles from it. Finally tried it for dinner and then for brunch. I got take out for dinner and it was delicious and the service was quick and easy. My husband and I went back for brunch and I had the lobster omelet, I had them make it small (less egg) and it was delicious. My husband got the steak and eggs which was under cooked but they were quick to cook it right for him. All in all a great place to have around the corner."}
{"text":"Oh great little find! It's a tight fit inside but great food, just have patience getting a seat, don't go in a rush to sit :) Great food. Great prices ohh and delicious coffee!"}
{"text":"We are vacationing in Lake Wylie and decided to take the 20 minute trip over to Fort Mill to check out this restaurant. I am SO glad we did! The service and the food were absolutely incredible. The White Cheddar Pimento Cheese appetizer puts all other pimento cheese dishes to shame. We could not stop talking about it as we devoured it! I ordered the Crab BLT and my husband had the Meatloaf Sammy  and we both finished everything on our plates! I highly recommend visiting The Flipside Cafe. (We are trying to figure out how to fit another visit in on this trip!)"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in my experience this weekend. My husband's food came out before mine, because my \"eggs were still working.\" When my Eggs Benedict came out, it was SWIMMING in hollandaise. I mean, it could have spilled over the lip of the plate. I soon realized why-to cover the completely uncooked eggs underneath. Even after asking for a plate and scooping off the salvageable parts of the dish, the servers didn't choose to notice the total mess that I was served. I was embarrassed to even say anything, so I didn't. I even noticed another Benedict come out of the kitchen with light scoops of sauce on either poached egg. The way it should be.

If it doesn't come out of the kitchen correctly, an employee should intercept. Bottom line, there are too many good breakfast places in the Charlotte area to bother with a spot like this. Womp."}
{"text":"Breakfast: 

For the record, this was my second visit, both with the same results.  VERY limited menu and food is just ok.  Over med eggs should not be that hard to make (pic).  Service was good.

Unfortunately, I was expecting something much better based on the Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"We came here based on the Yelp reviews when we were in town. So unbelievably good and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Had dinner at a new place in Fort Mill and wasn't disappointed.

PROS:
Excellent food.
Wide variety of choices.
Cozy relaxing atmosphere. 
They support local farmers. (Try the Kale)
Good service.
They appreciate and listen to customer feedback.

CONS:
The Country music playing almost made me lose my appetite."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this place. I've heard people say it was great, and I've read reviews on here. So, I decided to give it a try. My order was a to-go order for blueberry buttermilk pancakes, crispy bacon, and the Carolina grits with pimento cheese-bacon jam. Honestly, I expected so much better, considering the reviews. The pancakes were so incredibly dense. Like, I couldn't get through one bite w/o water. They also just tasted bland, like flour with a splash of blueberry. The grits were lumpy as opposed to creamy, and I could have done w/o the jam. Lastly, the \"crispy\" bacon that wasn't crispy at all but super chewy instead. I really don't think I'll go back here again. If I do, maybe I'll try lunch or dinner. ?"}
{"text":"(Brunch is only available on weekends - Oct, 2016)
Atmosphere builds as you walk down the alley to enter; it almost feels like a tiny piece of Italy passing the outdoor seating between Flipside and .. whatever is next door. I'll admit I was initially annoyed at not being able to enter from the street side door where our group of four parked for lunch but this was a happy surprise.
The staff is friendly, everyone enjoyed their food, and our server was awesome! (Can't remember her name at the moment.)
I convinced our group to come here using all the amazing Yelp pics but was disappointed to find out most of the items I'd been excited about were only served on weekends for brunch. I ended up having the amazing shrimp and grits and an order of truffle fries on the side - wow, those are Realy Flavorful truffle fries and there are a Lot of them! I couldn't finish the fries and I had worked hard all morning - that's impressive.
I would Love to come back for a date for dinner any night or brunch for sure!"}
{"text":"Randomly popped in here after the run and ride at Carowinds.  This place was awesome! Missing a star as the chicken and waffles gave half a waffle. That would have been nice to know, however it was excellent! Wonderful craft beer selection! Everything they have is local and comes from a local farm!"}
{"text":"Service is okay. The site is tiny and cramped. The food is local products, very creative and pretty decent execution. Nice chance of pace."}
{"text":"Tried The Flipside Cafe today with my parents after church, because it had awesome reviews-- it didn't disappoint!!! Kind of a diner vibe, but the service was great (shout out to Sylvia who took great care of us) and the food was incredible. It's hard to rate breakfast food because anyone and their brother can cook an egg. Their omelet was one of the best I have ever had and I had a biscuit covered with cheese and topped with an over-easy egg and it was to die for!!! I'll be back again soon and will tell all my friends!!!"}
{"text":"Very small & cozy but pleasant. Brussels sprouts were outstanding! Tomato soup, asparagus salad and peach crisp were all very good too."}
{"text":"Food is always good! I love the breakfast, my favorite would be the gravy and biscuits. The service in the morning is always great BUT I went on a Saturday afternoon to get something to go and no one helped me at all! A lady spoke but no said 'we'll be with you in a sec', they just looked at me and kept moving. There were like 6 people working with one table. I suggest you go early in the mornings."}
{"text":"New in town and the Flipside Cafe made me feel welcome and at home. Reasonably priced and great service. Leemah was a pleasure to work with."}
{"text":"They added on!! So happy they expanded. Always loved grabbing breakfast here and now I don't have to wait. They had a red velvet waffle special today. Amazing! Everyone is always so friendly and I love how they decorated the new addition. Glad I live near by ;)"}
{"text":"We have only been here for two months and this quickly has become a weekend staple. They are friendly as ever and the food is awesome. I have eaten The Fort Mill Biscuit Bake... AMAZING. I had a hard time ordering anything else because it's so good! This time around we ordered Potato Bravas and I got the Chicken and Waffles.  chicken was cooked perfectly and Waffle was golden and warm, I ate the entire thing. I guess the only negative there would be it's not weight watcher friendly... it could be but it's hard to resist the goodness. Potato Bravas my husband enjoyed, the potatoes are next to amazing but for me personally I don't like rosemary so they weren't for me. With that being said they were cook perfect and seem to be a huge hit. Coffee is always good, they keep it coming without asking. And the main thing for me is they are always awesome to my kids!!! We will continue our weekend ritual for sure. Thank you Flipside!!"}
{"text":"I have to rewrite this review. I have no idea what happened, but the food is God awful. The potatoes are excruciatingly salty, (there is salt on the table- why ruin it for us) the shepherd pie had no taste at all. My family came to visit and I was super excited to take them here. They said if I ever bring them back they'll pack up and leave lol. The place is always super busy so I don't know...I'm done at the flip side. It was just that bad!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal restaurant ! The breakfast was delicious and the service was excellent. Totally recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This cafe was a nice intro to Southern Breakfast. We bother ordered the breakfast special which included eggs, bacon, grits, and a biscuit with gravy. I had never had grits and man these were good! They had a nice cheesy flavor and a great texture. The biscuit was clearly homemade along with the gravy. Both were good. It the gravy seemed to have a little too much grease included in the roux. The coffee was strong which is a big win. 

Overall a great little find. It was a good value in more than one way, we were able to skip lunch it was so filling."}
{"text":"The best all-round restaurant in the Charlotte Area. I have been going there regularly since it opened and never had a bad meal or service."}
{"text":"Fun little menu and the small plates were good. We had a bottle of wine and a few small plates and were good to go. 

Shrimp tacos and the pork belly are pretty delicious. The pretzel and pimento was just ok for us."}
{"text":"Really liked this placed for brunch! I had the peaches n cream French toast and the grits and it was all very tasty. Small area but very neat atmosphere and they serve booze!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about the breakfast here.  Honestly the best, fluffiest grits I ever had.   Biscuit, bacon and even the scrambled egg were somehow made extra flavorful.  So glad we found this spot!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Friendly staff and fresh food. The sourdough toast tasted homemade, and the eggs were perfect. Going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"The chicken salad was so salty. It was to bad since it looked delicious. My kids burgers were great. The pimento Dip w pretzels were very good"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot.  Quick service, but get there early for lunch, its small inside but well worth it.  I tried the meatloaf mac n cheese and the next day the chicken salad sandwich.  The $5.00 burgers looked great, and tasted better.  Try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here based on an article from Offline Charlotte \"7 Badass breakfast spots in Charlotte\".   I must say this restaurant did not disappoint. We arrived approx 5 mins before the 9 AM open and were promptly seated.  

Ordered the Morning Glory which was one of the surprise muffins offered that day.  OMG it was served cut in half and warmed perfectly.  A nice treat which was shared by our party of 3. 

Next up my son who is 8 ordered from the adult menu the chicken and waffles which came with fruit and bacon. The waffle was one of ghee best i have tasted and the chicken cooked wonderfully and lightly battered.  For me it could have used some salt however one could always add a dash if preferred.  My son devoured it . 

My wife and I split the lobster omelette and ordered a side of potatoes which were served in a skillet and we were satisfied. It was delish and I could see a big piece of lobster meat in there.  Overall we were pleased with our meal and the service and will def be back.  Already told some folks about the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Just had the shepard's pie and bread pudding for desert.  Awesome food and perfect service. Courtney is the best.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is our favorite little surprise. Crazy great menu! Great drink specials and always great service one of our very favorite brunch spots in town"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things. My chicken and waffles were out of this world. My husband enjoyed his shrimp and grits. Mimosas were only $3. Service was fast and friendly. Too bad this place is not closer to my house...then again, that may be a good thing to keep me from gaining weight!"}
{"text":"1/23/16 went for breakfast with two friends ordered three eggs over easy with bacon, coffee. They came out with two eggs Sunnyside up! Told the I wanted three over easy not two, they came back with three sunny side up! Took it back again, this time I got three over easy by now the toast is cold! It's only breakfast.  Three eggs, bacon, toast, no home fries. Cost $16 ! That's right $16. I'm from north jersey,  NYC. Very expensive area breakfast never cost me that much. Never go for breakfast  again. We were searching a place to go every Saturday morning. The server was very good,kept the coffee filled and warm"}
{"text":"Overall had a very pleasant experience at this restaurant! Service was great, our waitress was very patient and helpful. The other staff members were kind as well. 

I came during lunch time and ordered the 'Steak and Potatoes'. My friend ordered the 'Shrimp and Grits'. Our foods came out pretty quickly and everything tasted wonderful!"}
{"text":"Customer service was good but I didn't find the food outstanding. The potatoes were really good w eggs ordered alacarte. It would have been nice to have a meal version that included toast. coffee was good, my friend got the poached eggs. She seemed happy. We liked that this place focused on local produce which is prolly why we would come back versus craving anything specific. I heard great things about the desserts but i was not impressed. The samoan coconut cremem had no flavor and it was loaded into a super hard flavorless shell. The cobbler was much better.  Overall it was just ok."}
{"text":"The most amazing meal and service I can remember in a very long time! Anne was in point! I had the Fried Green tomato BLT and fries which came out piping hot and delicious. My husband had a special plate which included fantastic peaches for brunch. This is a long drive from our home but I will make the trip again. Great gem in Ft.Mill!!!"}
{"text":"i tried the lobster omelete, it was pretty good, fresh ingredients, clean restaurant"}
{"text":"Braised pork belly, ricotta gnocchi, shrimp and grits, bagette.
I've not had any of these dishes before. 
The ricotta gnocchi was such a creamy goodness and the mix of vegetables with it were delightful.  We had shrimp and grits with soy chorizo- I believe the spinach was a good add for the grits and the chorizo.  The bagette was served with two different butters- strawberry rhubarb and praline. Both very good. The braised pork belly was dry and I found cutting the meat like an armwrestling tournament. The server was very sweet and she tended to us in quick time.  
My company made up for the braised pork, but they did tell me the sister restaurant had a better version of it. It could have been just a bad night for the chef at our restaurant."}
{"text":"So I have loved getting breakfast here in the past. The lobster omelet was to die for. So stopped in for lunch since was driving through ... the restaurant has doubled in size, and our server must have been having a bad hair day or something. She was efficient, but  a grump. The sandwich I got was good, but the bread was not worth eating, and so I just pushed it off to the side. I love that they claim to be local food, and that they seem to want to make healthy food ... the fruit cup is a good substitute for a side for example. But the experience was a bit off today. Not bad, but not as friendly as it has been in the past."}
{"text":"The Benne Benne was amazing! Probably one of the best eggs Benedict I have ever eaten. The coffee was awesome too!"}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered from this place is delicious and perfectly prepared. The lobster omelette is one of my favorites. They make the best coffee around too."}
{"text":"Great pimento cheese grits and brunch in general!  Only con was they served pancake syrup instead of maple syrup. 

Overall it was great and we will be back."}
{"text":"What a great find thanks to Yelp! Cute, great waitstaff and fabulous food. The Grits should not be missed! Wish I could have taken them home!"}
{"text":"For local, casual southern fare, this place is hard to beat. Good hearty breakfast from lobster omelets, biscuits & gravy, pancakes, french toast, and their pimento cheese grits are REALLY good. For lunch, I like the asparagus and fried egg salad or Amy's pimento grilled cheese deluxe with fried green tomatoes and BACON JAM. Small place, but if you're in Fort Mill, it's a must-try."}
{"text":"I've been here two times and I will be back for a third. The key to a good dining experience to me and most folks is consistency. They have that here. I did not order the same meal as I did the first time instead I went with the daily breakfast special (2 eggs, grits, biscuit and gravy with bacon). They allowed me to sub bacon with tofu chorizo. Another thing I love about a restaurant, flexibility. Not too much flexibility but enough to make sure the customer is satisfied."}
{"text":"We will come back to Flipside again and again. The couple of times we've been there everything was spot on. Delicious brunch or lunch. Looking forward to when I can make it for dinner."}
{"text":"Small place but well worth a visit. Amy's pimento cheese is delicious. The tomato soup is the best!  The grits are amazing. I've been here for breakfast and lunch and have loved everything I've eaten here."}
{"text":"I am forever grateful for my colleague's recommendation to try out Flipside Cafe. I went for brunch and ordered the Maine lobster omelette with potatoes instead of the seasonal fruit it comes with. Most restaurants skimp on the ingredients inside their omelettes, especially when it comes to seafood items, but Flipside did not. I got a mouthful of lobster, smoked bacon, and cheddar in every bite. It was absolutely delicious! My friend ordered the shrimp and grits with a side of blueberry pancakes. I snuck a couple bites of each and also enjoyed those entrees very much. For the price and portion sizes you just can't beat Flipside Cafe. Moreover, the service was prompt and friendly. After looking at the lunch and dinner menus online, I am positive I will be back for more visits."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Local. Delicious Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"Food was great! We split shrimp and grits and the spare ribs which melted in your mouth! The seasonal strawberry bread pudding was super dry and the waiter seemed like he didn't want to help us bc we didn't have a reservation and stuck us by the counter so the place inside was small and not so great. Want to try their other location for sure!!"}
{"text":"Expecting better based upon reviews but no luck, though my wife's sandwich was good.  Great service and friendly server.  First issue was wine pour - maybe 1 1/2\" for a glass of Cabernet that I finished in 4 sips.  Ordered tomato soup which came luke warm.  Returned it and it came back luke warm again.  Turkey panini was served warm with accompanying cheese still firm and thickened inside the sandwich.  Ate half.  6:30 on a Thursday night and very few people.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I treated myself again after my first visit 7 months ago.  A small band of smart people were waiting for them to open just before 9 AM for Saturday brunch.  Clue #1: there's something happening here that's worth waiting in line

About 5 months ago they expanded into the store next door practically doubling their footprint.  Includes a nice counter with about a dozen stools plus plenty of tables, too.  Clue #2:  they are expanding to meet the demand.

I ordered the Flipside Café breakfast special.  $10 dollars gets you a sampler of Southern classics--a biscuit and gravy, two eggs cooked to order, strips of bacon, and cheesy grits.  The gravy was more like a tangy bechemel meets hollandaise.  Excellent riff on sausage gravy.  Coffee is from Counter Culture out of Asheville, NC.  Perfect.

Clue #3:  they prefer to think out of the box and deliver exceptional food at reasonable prices.  Still clueless as to why you're missing out?  Hmmm.  Clue #4:   \"Give 'em a Whirl.\""}
{"text":"Great food and unique menu selections. This little tucked away cafe has some good treats for your tummy. 

The staff are courteous/attentive people. The foods are freshly made and deelish...like every restaurant there can be different chefs on duty so the meals may be one off. Consistent order mess ups or prepared improperly warrants a negative review but I can speak for my own experience. When checking options in Fort Mill, the choices are limited for a decent breakfast. Being a local person here the convenience is important to me.

Stop in and check this delightful cafe out ... you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I really like what this place had to offer. They had a great family atmosphere, and the food was delicious. I took the family last night and it was horrible. The menu was limited as always, but I respected that in the past. The selections were always prepared with care and the utmost detail, but tonight it was bad. I know they use a lot of pork products but literally nearly everything on the menu had bacon or pork infused in it. I could at least get shrimp & grits with soy chorizo in the past. The lamb duo which I asked for well because I know they would cook it medium well if I asked for well was still pretty red in the middle. Pink I can do but red and bloody I don't. The lemonade which used to be fresh squeezed was Minute Maid and it was gross. Our waiter while nice was just okay. (Not a first with the subpar wait staff- waited 15 minutes once trying to pay a check). The Alfredo was over cooked and bland. My boys fell asleep waiting. My only good comment comes from the waiter or busboy from Florida who greeted us with a smile and help package my food when he saw both my kiddos sleeping and it would have been a hassle to do it myself. He wasn't my waiter, but honestly, he was nicer and more accommodating than our own waiter. I have tried to like this place. It had everything I liked about a local eatery, fresh local ingredients, close by, nice quaint atmosphere, but perhaps breakfast and brunch is the way to go here. Dinner just wasn't hitting on much at all."}
{"text":"Great local fresh food. Nice ambiance and great service. They have another location in rock hill and a new sandwich place in pineville which we will be trying. 
I had the salmon and wife had their spin of shrimp and grits with roasted tomatoes and spinach."}
{"text":"This place is really wonderful.  I went on a Monday and they had all beers $2!  They are yummy local craft beers.  You can't beat that special.  I went with 2 others and we got the salmon sandwich-super delicious, seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The burger special--juicy and tasty. The pimento cheese and bacon jam went perfectly with the flavorful beef.  This doesn't come with a side so we got fried brussel sprouts as a side and they were outstanding!  I am craving them just writing this review.  The last order was the turkey Panini.  It was an average Panini compared to the other excellent foods we had ordered.  I recommend everyone go there!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch experience!
The 5 Buck Chuck was off the chain & I am not a fan of Pimento cheese! 
Roasted potatoes for the side were flat out good!
I especially liked the melted sugar water they being you with unsweetened tea so you can make it exactly to your preference. 
If there is one criticism, it would be not to expect a quick lunch. Worth it though!
I shall be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast with great service!  My husband and I stopped in here on a Sunday morning on a whim. I ordered the lobster omelette with a biscuit on the side. He had the chicken and waffles. So good that we could have had a second plate of each. Generous amount of lobster with the perfect amount of cheese and bacon. The waffle melted in your mouth and the fried chicken breast was divine!  And that biscuit was fluffy with just the right amount of salt. Hot, delicious coffee!  We will be back."}
{"text":"After a very long hot day in the sun at a football combine we stopped for a bite to eat at Flipside. Such a great choice as we like to try something new. Here's why I'm giving it a 4 star, if I can give them 4.5 than I would.  My Beef on Weck was absolutely without a doubt the best I've had and the White Bean Hummuz....oh my goodness, it was so tasty...by the time I thought about taking a picture of it, it was all gone, I mean clean plate gone. Both my husband and my son got Steak and Potatoes and it seemed over cooked for medium rare...it was more on the medium well side but they both said the sauce was delicious. My son also got the Loaded Fried Potatoes and devoured it. Our waitress, Meg, she was so sweet and such a delight. She had such a beautiful smile, she was funny and just awesome. One of the best service we had. If we didn't live 3 hours away, I would make that a regular spot for me to dine in at."}
{"text":"Second time here. First for brunch and loved having mimosas and legit southern comfort food. Biscuits and gravy was so good! Came to late lunch/early dinner with the family and we enjoyed that as well. Kiddo had mac and cheese which was so good I really hoped he wasn't going to eat it all! I enjoyed a yummy Waldorf chicken salad sandwich and the fries, are to die for! Can't wait to head back soon!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Carowinds and found this little gem for dinner. Please give it a try! The menu is creative and delicious!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a late breakfast (they open at 10) on Sunday to check this place out. There are not that many breakfast places near me so we were excited. 
Although they open at 10, there were already 2-3 tables seated so that was good. Did not need to wait! I would say there are about 12-15 tables in there and the cafe is on the smaller side.  
I might give the place another chance once they get the swing of things going but I was not too impressed. I wanted to be! Again, think service and food will get better but its not there yet. The service was not super friendly, which I dont need, but a smile would be welcoming. The coffee comes out of a thermos that you pump out the top which is fine if it keeps it hot, but it wasnt too hot. Maybe thicker mugs would keep it that way. 
We ordered the house made ricotta with fruit and walnuts which was different, but I was surprised that the ricotta had lemon and herbs in it. They forgot the honey, which I think it was supposed to come with, so I asked for that and added it and it tasted better.
My husband got the cinnamon waffler (slightly underdone so just not crisp enough) and I got the eggs benedict. There are two eggs, which it did not say on the menu so that is good! However, they were overcooked so not runny. The hollandaise was delicious, however.
I do applaud the fact that they support and use some local products. I am glad that the cafe is in this location though because it seems like lots of familes are taking advantage of it."}
{"text":"No comments on the food.

But I needed a cup of coffee really quick. I'm lactose intolerant so this doesn't appeal to a large audience. Anyways no soy, almond or lactose free milk and the coffee didn't taste that great. Wasn't a fan."}
{"text":"Great little place,  an awesome find. Fresh food.  I am not much of an omelet person but I had to order the lobster omelette when I saw it on the menu. It was very good my only suggestion to the wait staff was possibly put cream cheese in there because omelets can be kind of dry sometimes. she immediately brought me a bowl of creme fraiche and that is what I needed. Staff was very very friendly food was fantastic. This is definitely a place I will return to"}
{"text":"I stayed in the area for an event for work. The group of 9 of us ended up getting lunch and dinner here two days in a row. Literally my favorite thing about Fort Mill, SC. We loved it, meat eaters and vegetarians alike. 

There was a great salad with caramelized peaches, the Bibb salad, we raved about the meatloaf, the burgers, and the shepherds pie. The pretzels with the cheese suave as appetizers were to DIE for.

The whole place is super cute, the owner is friendly, and the food is amazing/fresh/local/delicious. Definitely check this place out!! If you're going to be with a group, call ahead. They can get a little crowded but if you have to wait, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Perfect for Brunch but be sure to show up early. There's not my much space. It's worth the wait, though. 

They've recently expanded their brunch menu too. 

For lunch, don't miss their awesome hamburger. It's a great and really tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Chicken and waffles were awesome and so was the poblano and bacon omelette. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great bistro-type restaurant! My wife and I had their 'custom' meatloaf.. none better! Made from braised short ribs- delicious. Great wine, ambiance, service.. very friendly. Choc brownie dessert to kill for. Perfect spot! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very impressed!!!!! The family and I were wanting a quick breakfast before the Panthers game so we went to crackel barrel and they had a 30 minute wait. I immediately jumped on yelp and saw that the flipside cafe was a mile away. We went and I am so happy! We found our new spot! Customer service was amazing! Loved that the food is local and it just tasted so darn good!!! I had the Benne Benne and cleaned my plate! We will be back!!!!! Found out they have lunch and dinner too so can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, reasonable prices. All the ingredients are sourced from local farms. The menu is very creative, and there isn't a dud on the lot. The Shepherd's Pie is delicious, and the meat loaf is wonderful. We also tried the sweet potato ravioli and the pork belly appetizers, and they were both mouth-watering. Can't go wrong here. Highly recommend The Flip Side Cafe."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the environment was pleasant. There is a blackboard listing local farmers businesses they support."}
{"text":"Everything was great, especially the meatloaf with potatoes and gravy. Probably the best gravy I've ever had."}
{"text":"Fast service and a cute little cafe! Foods not that great and very overpriced! Side note: the gravy for the biscuit and gravy is made with ham not sausage!"}
{"text":"The Flipside Cade is welcoming and quaint, not to mention the food is delicious! Service is great as well! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I left this check-in tip and now am expanding into a review.  BTW, a good way to capture and \"image\" of someplace that you can further develop later. \"M - F 7-11 five buck special.  What a deal for a simple meal\".

Let me explain why a three-star v. four:  Salt!  There was so much large grain salt on everything that it made eating, let alone tasting, very difficult.  Our hope is that this is an isolated incident and I will amend when we return...soon.

Chef:  pls check your prep in the kitchen and monitor the amount of salt.

Fried potatoes were nicely seared chunks, but we had to scrape off the salt.  Ditto the wonderful sausage gravy over biscuits. How frustrating to realize the savory flavors, the best such gravy I have had in years, but the salt overload prevented us from wolfing it all down.

But I digress... 

This is an unassuming cafe, now restaurant opened by a chef couple who had worked at one of Charlotte's top restaurants.  The menu and ingredients reflect their exposure to more gourmet delights.  They serve Breakfast, lunch and dinner with some items carrying over from the previous menu.

I had the lobster omelet...really!  Made with sweet sauteed onions, cheese and asparagus.  What a treat for an early morning wake-up breakfast.  Cinnamon crunch waffle with bananas was like pastry.  Another treat.

And the eggs are made to order and they do an excellent sunny side up version.

Ask to look at the lunch and dinner menus as just reading the offerings will seduce you into returning to try.

We are anxious to return in the hopes that the salting is left more to the consumer than the kitchen.  

Flipside is special and worth your exploration."}
{"text":"We are so incredibly luck to live so close to this restaurant!
The place is tiny, so it is always packed! However, there is quick turn around on tables, so you'll only be waiting a few minutes.
You can't go wrong with the 'five buck chuck' burger. Cooked to order, it is a meal in itself. But I love to add home fries to it- crispy and delicious.
The other day we went for the brunch menu on Saturday. My friend and I shared the grits with pimiento cheese and bacon jam. Unbelievably good!
I had the eggs benne with asparagus which were just perfectly poached, and the English muffin was crispy, just how I like it! 
Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Always busy- always tasty food. Fills the gap for good, local food in this area. Ditch  the fast food joint & stop in for a delicious brunch or lunch. 

They make a mean cup of coffee & have some decent beers (in bottles) too!

One of the owners, Amy, is always out & about - serving food along with their friendly, proficient (but small) staff. 

Cool & clean place."}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing. I'm from Chicago and I travel all over the country. I will never ever drive past this place again. Try the Brusser sprouts could be made into a meal by itself."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love The Flipside Cafe. On our first visit, we arrived around 10am and were seating within 10 minutes. We enjoyed orange juice, coffee, a mystery muffin (pumpkin), eggs benedict, and waffles. All were incredibly delicious. My favorite was the muffin. It was fresh and warm. Overall, the staff and food are wonderful."}
{"text":"The mixed drinks are stiff and the brisket dinner is amazing. Service is nice and very attentive. They respond to complaint and resolute then very quickly."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh, and they use locally-sourced foods. Really good stuff here....unique flavors you'll never find at a chain restaurant, terrific service, and a laidback setting. Absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Sister and I planned on lunch, FYI, brunch is usually done by 1:00 but on this Saturday they were packed and switching over to lunch was delayed for a short 15 minutes. Well worth the wait for the delicious Chuck burger, $7.00 for weekend lunch, (a deal) and even better bargain, Monday thru Friday for $5.00. When I say this was the best burger I have eaten I mean it. A juicy burger grilled perfectly medium rare (imagine that) getting it my way. The burger consisted of a brioche bun, their bacon jam, lettuce and topped with pimento cheese. The bacon jam and pimento cheese was a perfect compliment to the Chuck Burger. Home fried potatoes were cubes of crisp outsides and tender interiors.  Gosh, it was all so yummy, I finished the entire meal. I hear the Brussel sprout side dish is awesome too. I believe this tiny cafe is one secret gem. Glad sister and her daughter found this delicious place. Will return again soon, I'm craving that burger already. Keep up the good work Flipside. P. S. Great service and efficiency during a packed house Saturday."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of discovering this excellent little cafe while visiting friends in Charlotte NC last weekend. After doing a quick Yelp search this was the first stop listed and was a short hop over the border into SC from their place in Steele Creek. 

Once we arrived the place was smaller than expected and quite full, however they had a tablet for the four of us immediately. We're lucky we got there when we did because by the time we left there was a line outside waiting to get in. I wouldn't have wanted to wait in that heat. 

As I said the place was small, but you aren't packed in like sardines. The server took our drink orders as soon as we were seated and delivered menus and utensils with the drinks a couple of moments later. 

After looking over the excellent menu my friend Dave ordered the Maine Lobster Omelet. His wife and I decided to have the same entree, the Steak-N-Egg breakfast. Dave's brother Charles who was also visiting from out west went with the daily special, Cinnamon Crunch Waffles. 

After an appropriate wait our dishes arrived. Jessie and I both agreed that our Steak-N-Egg meals were delicious. On mine the  steak was cooked exactly as asked (Medium) and there was a decent portion of home fries topped with eggs. As I finished the meal I noticed there was no toast. Make sure you order that if you want it was it doesn't come with the dish. Dave's Lobster Omelet also looked awesome, he enjoyed it but said it wasn't as \"out of this world\" as he had hoped. Charles also said he really enjoyed his Cinnamon Crunch Waffles. 

All in all, an excellent breakfast. Next time I'm in the area maybe I'll get a chance to check them out for dinner."}
{"text":"I woke up Sunday morning craving a chicken waffle and knew exactly where to go - the Flipside Cafe! Located a mile from Carowinds on the NC/SC border, this popular farm to table breakfast and lunch joint is normally packed with locals. This was my third visit for breakfast and it was very good each time. 

I have now tried their top three breakfast sellers - the Lobster Omelet, Chicken Waffle and Shrimp & Grits - and they were all very tasty but the Chicken Waffle has become my favorite. It arrived sandwiched between two waffle triangles and topped with two slices of slab bacon. The chicken was lightly battered and perfectly cooked. An unspectacular fruit salad rounded out the dish that didn't seem freshly prepared. At $10 though this dish is a pretty good deal and one I'll order again.

The Lobster Omelet is delicious and a close second to the chicken. It has chunks of Maine lobster and loaded with other good stuff. It appeared to be the morning's biggest hit based upon our neighboring tables. 

Upon first bite, the Shrimp and Grits are fantastic. Consisting of several large shrimp resting upon their housemade cheesy grits and topped off with spinach and crumbled chorizo sausage, it is much bolder than the typical versions that can be somewhat bland. However, halfway through, my palate became somewhat overwhelmed by the high salt content. To me, it's one of those dishes that are a great for the first few bites but quickly become tiring. Still its popularity alone says all you need to know.

The pimento cheese grits at $5 are exceptional and are a must. If it's biscuits that you want though, do yourself a favor and go to the Bojangles down the street, as the biscuits here are fair at best.

The coffee is decent and topped off faithfully but, at 3 bucks, it's hard to pass on a latte or a cappuccino. The newly added dining area provides great atmosphere. It was very tight before. Service is okay, but in our experience here, the young staff spends too much time chatting among themselves and not enough time waiting on customers.

Overall, I have to rate this joint 4 stars and a Gotta Try!"}
{"text":"This was the first time to visit The Flipside Cafe for me and my husband.  After reading all the great reviews we decided to give this place a try.  Wow it was everything everyone said and they left out the 1/2 price wine Tuesday's!  The food was delicious the waitress was friendly, helpful and very attentive.  We we definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Recommended to me by my dog trainer after one of our sessions down the street at the greenway, really good food after a long walk!!
Pimento cheese is amazing."}
{"text":"The pimento cheese is amazing. I've never had it this fresh where every ingredient popped. I need this by the pound and spread over everything."}
{"text":"Cool little spot we found near our job. The place is located in a small shopping center. Not really big on cafe places but wanted to eat small so figured it be worth a shot. I had a BLT sandwich, with grilled asparagus. Both were delicious, and filling. 

Only downsides in my opinion:

*asparagus was a little burnt. 
*we were not informed prior to dinning that their credit card machines were down, thus causing us to pay in cash. I didn't have any on me, so it was a bit of an inconvenience, but I understand things happen. 

Overall the vibe at this place and the service, was pretty good. I'd definitely go back for another BLT."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! It was my first time eating chicken and waffles and I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is nice and inviting and the staff was on top of it. I'm looking forward to going back and trying all of the other yummy goodness they have. We did wait about ~15 minutes but its well worth it."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to write a review for a while for The Flipside and seeing it posted in The Queens Feast inspired me. Yes it's in an itty bitty strip mall, but don't judge this book buy it's parking lot because inside awaits one of the best farm to table blackboard restaurants in the Charlotte area. Every beer, cheese, veggie, and piggy has been pain stakingly noted up on their board for you to enjoy. A simple and delicious farm to table, fresh and perfect meal from beginning to end. It's a small location intimate location, so if you are a big party, more than 6 call ahead. If you are looking for something bigger go to their other location off Main street in Rock Hill. Same amazing Farm to Table food with a much larger menu and a large dinning area that can handle big parties."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and since they expanded into what used to be the ice cream place next door, now seating is better with less wait times.  Although, reservations are still the best bet."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The service is excellent, the food even better. You absolutely have to get their potatoes. And their biscuit and gravy is to die for! Definitely family friendly. 
It well worth adding an extra hour on to our 3 hour drive"}
{"text":"My wife found this spot on yelp and wanted to grab brunch (waffles and such). By the time we made it around there, we missed brunch but ate there anyway. Glad we stayed, perfect service and great tasting Shrimp and Grits. A definite do-over."}
{"text":"We arrived during the dead zone between lunch and dinner (3pm).  The place was clean and organized, so they recovered well from the lunch rush.  Alice was our server, and she was attentive and ready to discuss the beer selection and the rest of the menu.  She was passionate about the food and the restaurant - to the point I thought she might be the owner, not knowing any better.

My wife chose the \"6 buck Chuck\"  burger lunch special with fries, along with a side of flash-fried Brussels sprouts with bacon, drizzled in balsamic vinegar.  All the components of the burger, including the house-made pimento cheese, blended well to make an excellent burger.  The fries stayed crispy throughout the meal.

My choice was the meatloaf (grass-fed beef), wrapped in bacon, with crispy onions on the top and served over mac n cheese.  The mac n cheese was creamy and flavorful, and the meatloaf was simply terrific.

The restaurant side is soon to be renovated, to update, and more match the bar side.  It shows some sign of wear, but the tables were in excellent condition, and did not take away one bit from the quality of the meal - and that's what you're there for, anyway.

My only regret is that I'm not from the area, so I might not get there again.  If you are in the area, this is a must-visit."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a while and was so happily impressed. Even though it's in a strip mall they've done such a good job making the place sweet and quaint. Our very friendly waitress recommended the burger and Brussels sprouts and the tomato soup. The Brussel sprouts were fantastic, a total win. The burger was my girlfriends and it looked great and she was pleased. The tomato soup was beautiful and silky. Can't wait to hit the breakfast menu next time."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I went with my sister who was visiting from NYC. Initially her food came out stone cold. They made it right, and in the end we really enjoyed our breakfast, but that is why we gave it 4 stars. I got the chicken and waffles - delicious. My sister got eggs and sausage and grits. She doesn't usually eat grits, but she said she thoroughly enjoyed them, once they came out hot."}
{"text":"Great food and service, generally, but with some consistency issues. Fantastic brunch. The potato bravas is everything I want in potatoes. Even a bacon and egg basic breakfast is yummy because of the high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Cool environment, really nice staff. A lot of locally sourced farm ingredients. Menu seems to change occasionally, but most of their dishes all sounded good. Definitely recommend their muffins"}
{"text":"I seldom give a poor review, however, in this case I just have to do this. I saw all the wonderful reviews and just had to try this place. Very cute when we walked in. But that's where it all ended. To start with the coffee was not good at all. However, I have been places that the coffee wasn't good, the food was. Well, not here. We ordered the Carolina grits, it has pimento cheese topped with a bacon jam. That was suppose to come out first, it didn't. I had the lobster omelette, it was extremely dry and cooked to the point that I had to actually use my knife to cut the omelette! Yikes!  The fruit side looked straight out of the plastic container you get at the grocery store. My friend had the Eggs Benedict. The eggs were poached well, the sauce was cold. The asparagus side was so salty you couldn't eat it. Our coffees went unfilled for most of the meal, which was ok, the water was much better. Then the pimento cheese grits came out. I tasted white cheddar with two pimentos thrown on top. That bacon jam? I tasted vinegar there. And salt was freely placed on all these dishes, I wondered if perhaps the shaker just fell in the food while they were cooking?  The restaurant is cute though! I don't think I will return here, I will now stop by a coffee shop for some coffee.

I have to amend this, the owner contacted me and would like for me to return. I will most certainly do that, everyone has an off day."}
{"text":"I will not be back as they are not welcoming to children. They had 3 open tables that they could have seated the 4 of us at and made us wait with 2 boys. The manager does not want to have children in one side if the restaurant. They may have great food but we waited 15 minutes and still were not seated when we left."}
{"text":"An adorable cafe in the heart of downtown Rock Hill! My family has been to this restaurant 10 times and we've never had a bad experience. Every meal we have tried here has been exceptional. The staff is very friendly and always efficient and helpful. I highly recommend The Flipside if you're looking for a pleasant experience and a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Great spot for any occasion- especially Sunday brunch.  Pimento cheese grits were my favorite.  Great focus on local farms and ingredients.  Best new spot in the area!"}
{"text":"Love that this place supports local growers and farmers. Good food and good service a combination that's often hard to find."}
{"text":"Fantastic service with quality local ingredients and unique gourmet takes on southern classics. Go for lunch and get the $5 buck chuck! This is a locally owned, independent restaurant with an award winning chef."}
{"text":"So good!  Friendly service. Despite what others have said the A/C was working fine and it was comfortable inside. We were there for a late lunch. My husband had the Meatloaf Sammy open face sandwich w/ mashed potatoes and green beans. Those mashed potatoes were to die for. Chunky with skins. 

I had the roasted chicken chopped salad with corn, bacon and goat cheese. There were a variety of healthy greens as well as other veggies like squash. I also had the tomato bisque which was also delicious. 

Nice small charming place. We will be back."}
{"text":"Expertly crafted food with surprisingly delicious taste in every single item on the plate. I have eaten here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Flipside Cafe is an adorable cafe decorated with southern style and charm, with the friendliest and attentive service to match.  It's worth a super short drive from Charlotte for a great breakfast!

If you're a breakfast potato fan, the Potato Bravas are pretty incredible. They are perfectly and consistently crispy browned and seasoned.  I wish I could make that happen so well when I do it!  The rosemary creme fraiche takes it over the top with flavor, so good luck trying to stop yourself from devouring them. If you're not a rosemary and lemon fan, know that the rosemary lemon flavor is prominent. You may not care for them as much as I did if you're not a fan of that flavor profile.  I loved them. 

The sausage gravy had nice seasoning that took it up a notch from what I've found to usually be a little more bland tasting sausage gravy elsewhere.  Biscuits were on point.  So good!

I absolutely recommend Flipside Cafe and look forward to getting back and trying more of their menu.  This could be my favorite breakfast spot in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great service, and the $5 chuck burger special can't be beat!!! Fantastic burger, the house made pimento cheese is to die for! I LOVED the rosemary potatoes and flash fried brussels sprouts!"}
{"text":"We love this place for brunch. Everyone is kind, it's clean and the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Eh, just okay. I want to love this place because the service is fantastic and the atmosphere is really cute. The food I happen to order was actually called \"flip side breakfast\" so I would have thought this would have been their specialty.  The eggs were waaay overdone and the sausage and gravy wasn't that great either. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We found The Flipside Café online and decided to give it a try for our last lunch meal while visiting.  The place was packed and we snatched the last available table.  This was our first sign that we were in for a treat.  There were a ton of \"locals\" and a few newbies like ourselves.  We ordered the grits with spinach and shrimp.  We were a bit skeptical as it sounded a bit different but WOW, what a great appetizer and it arrived piping hot in a small little personal skillet.  I ordered a salad with chicken, goat cheese, sweet corn, bacon and avocado.  It was outstanding and so fresh.  My husband had a roasted turkey sandwich which was delicious.  Everything was so fresh and the service was outstanding although the restaurant was packed.  A MUST visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great food. Really small inside so come early or prepare to wait on Sunday's. The grits were my least favorite item on the menu but everything else was good. We went with the family and everyone enjoyed their food!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I just tried this place out one afternoon on our lunch break....been going back ever since. The owner, Amy is awesome...welcomes us by name each time and delivers a great menu. They buy locally, which is also a plus. Great food and people...you are guaranteed not to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Flip Side Cafe is an awesome restaurant.  They have a great menu with a lot of unique items.  Each entree I have ordered has been terrific, and you can't beat the five buck chuck burgers or lunch - great price and unbelievable favors!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dinner last night, Friday. Arrived just after 6 and the place was packed. Had no idea what to expect but had heard of it via an article on Jon Fortes. The space is very small and tight and they make the most of the space they have. Maybe has 10 or so tables, no bar. Service was good making a few recommendations. I went with the house salad and the scallops. Both were delicious!  Also had cheesecake for dessert. It was great too. Decent wine and beer selection. Place seem to clear out after 745 or so."}
{"text":"Flipside is the best place to eat in Fort Mill. The Cafe previously felt a little cramped, but with the (sort of recent) expansion into the additional space, it feels open and welcoming. The flavor and creativity of the food is outstanding, wine is reasonably priced and well curated and the experience is consistently good!"}
{"text":"So glad we tried this place... They did a wonderful bunch of tapas type dishes . The waitress was kind, very efficient...Guided us in the right direction with terrific first time food choices! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice small cafe serves southern comfort foods, made from locally grown produce.
Great brunch made even better by a fantastic server.
Jerri was funny, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. I took her recommendation of the soy chorizo potatoes and eggs skillet and was glad I had. It was wonderful."}
{"text":"Good food at good prices.  The daily breakfast for $5 is a really good meal for the money."}
{"text":"Outstanding visit, went on a Saturday afternoon and it was busy. Server was very nice and informative. We ordered an open face turkey sandwich and shrimp and grits. Really liked that they used unique, fresh local ingredients. Entrees had great flavor and were very plentiful and very fairly priced. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Omg the Fried Green Tomato BLT is awesome!!!
The Bread Pudding desert. Wow. Love bread pudding"}
{"text":"The food, the coffee, the service were all fantastic. There was no wait at 930 on Sunday morning.  Make sure you order the grits"}
{"text":"We came in for brunch on a Sunday afternoon and overall we had a good experience. We had to wait a bit for a table, it would have been less of a wait but the hostess was doing a whole bunch of things at one time so it took her a bit to get the table ready. She even seated people while in the middle of cleaning our table, would have made more sense to ask them to wait one moment seat us, then seat the newcomers. Anyways, the menu is a pretty classic brunch menu with quite a few interesting options. I got the BLT which was tasty, but the bacon wasn't very crispy which made the sandwich hard to eat. My cousin ordered the cinnamon waffle, it was a waffle with a pile of cinnamon toast crunch on it. The menu said cinnamon crunch on it but not cinnamon toast crunch so we weren't just expecting a pile of cereal! We were so shocked by it we didn't realize until half way through that the waffle was missing the spiced bananas! Once we tracked down the waitress she did send the manager on over who was very nice about the whole thing and apologized and took $2 off of the bill. If the bananas would have been on it with their tasty spiced sauce it would have softened the cereal and made a lot more sense. Our other friend got the chicken and waffles and really enjoyed it. The grits were quite tasty as well! Overall a good spot for brunch just a few kinks need to be worked out."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits were great. My fiancé got the meatloaf sammy and was impressed. He never gives complements but did here. We will definitely be back. They support local farms which we found to be nice too. The staff was so nice and even though they were very busy our good came out fast."}
{"text":"The place is small and there was a short wait in this Sunday morning.  But I will say the food is fantastic. Easily the best eggs I've ever had.  They get their eggs from local farms and you can taste the difference.  I got the Flipside Special with bacon, eggs, biscuits and gravy. A side order of fried potatoes substituted for grits.  Nice crispy thick cut bacon and delicious biscuits.  I will say I didn't care for their house coffee.  The coffee seemed bitter to me.  Nothing a little more sugar and cream didn't fix.  My server was very very busy but attentive with a warm personality.  Going to try and make it back before my return trip home. I loved this place.  I'll say it's my favorite breakfast restaurant ever."}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite.  There is something for everyone and we are so grateful for the attention they give to those with food allergies.  The staff at Flipside goes above and beyond to make sure we eat yummy AND safe food.  Courtney is our FAVORITE server.  She is attentive, friendly, helpful, professional, quick and a joy to interact with.  We HIGHLY recommend The Flipside Cafe and ask for Courtney!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, especially the chicken and waffles but other things on the menu were great as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious smoked bacon and cheddar omelette! I think it's one of the top 5 I've ever had. I tried my boyfriend's grits and they were perfect as well and that potatoes. I loved everything about this place, will definitely be back to try their lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for breakfast or brunch!! The owners are personable, and the staff is so friendly. Most importantly, the food is exceptional!!!! Check out their review on MochaNotes.com"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Normally I don't really like grits but I cleaned my plate. The potatoes were fantastic. Farm fresh eggs and biscuits, very very good. The iced latte with simple syrup was perfect. Nice staff and very clean. Go eat."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and decided to check out Flipside for breakfast this morning and WOW were we pleasantly surprised. Coming from closer to the city we were used to having weekend breakfast at the top brunch spots and we both felt like our meal here beat all of those places. My fiancé got the chicken and waffles and I got the Cinnamon Toast Crunch waffle, both were amazing! This cafe is a must try!"}
{"text":"The fella and I ventured back, this time for dinner on a Wednesday night now that they're serving wine and beer. 

While the food was still really good - Shepherd's Pie, pork belly appetizer, and warm greens salad - the service was slooooow. Our waitress was MUCH nicer than the one we had at brunch, but it took forever for her to check in on us. The fella had an empty wine glass for a good 20 minutes and had just stood up to walk over to her and order another when she finally noticed and ran over.

When we first go there, there were 4 other tables she was waiting on, and she seemed to be the only waitress. By the end, it was just us in there, and we were still having trouble getting service. 

But at least she was friendly. Sigh."}
{"text":"Move over Toast. I found my new favorite breakfast spot. The hubby was taking me to breakfast and he wanted Waffle House. I wanted something different and spotted Flipside Cafe. We thankfully decided to try it out. 

I love the ambiance of Flipside. It's casual, but also a little upscale and modern. And It's not as noisy as other restaurants we've been to so we can actually hear each other talk. And service is great. Seating was no problem and our server was friendly. 

The menu has a lot of comfort food with Southern accents. They also use locally sourced ingredients. I wanted to try so many things. I landed on a soy chorizo hash and the hubby chose my second choice the Fort Mill biscuit breakfast bake. When the food came out, my eyes widened. Mine came in a beautiful wide bowl and the portion was huge. His came in a small cast iron skillet and a side of fresh fruit. My hash was topped with two overeasy eggs. When I cut into the egg, it dripped onto the hash. And there's nothing sexier than that. The hash was flavorful and I loved the spices in the soy chorizo. I wish there was a little more peppers and onions because they were crisp and delicious.  I couldn't finish, but took the rest home along with a coffee to go. The biscuit bake was also tasty. It was everything I love about breakfast in one dish: fluffy biscuits, bacon, cheese and gravy, topped with eggs. 

We've decided this will be our new breakfast spot. And I can't wait to try them for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great little place tucked away in strip mall. Be prepared to be wowed by the flavors of each dish. This is gourmet food at reasonable prices. Simply the best pimento cheese spread I have ever had. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant!! I've been so much they now recognize me!  The food is very fresh & tasty. Staff is very nice. Pimento cheese dip is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Quick and delicious eat! Everything we had was perfect, all of us were very satisfied with the food, service and prices."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some coworkers. All you could ask for for a laid back breakfast spot. I had the bacon and pepper omelette. Very tasty. Service was really good too, waitress hunted down a phone charger for my coworker use while we ate"}
{"text":"Very unique restaurant.... Intimate setting with dining & bar area.

I dined here for lunch. Had a delicious BLT sandwich made on homemade bread, thick slices of bacon & ripe tomato! I added a side of their famous brussel sprouts. DELICIOUS...  I'm looking forward to returning for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is a tiny hole in the wall, but the food is really, really good.  We went for breakfast, and had a muffin, the Flipside breakfast, and a bacon cheddar omelet, all of which were outstanding.  Just go.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Tried the breakfast menu and were pleasantly surprised. It was hard to pick just one meal!  Fresh tasty food.  Looking forward to trying out more of the menu."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast at flipside. We tried the potato brava first (delicious) then went for the lobster omelet and blt. They both came with a side of fruit. It felt like everything was made with care. Our server, Josh was friendly and attentive. I love the ambience.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I just moved to the area, and stopped in because they were open for brunch and had good reviews. It definitely lived up to them! We've been twice now, brunch both times, but their lunch and dinner menus look awesome as well. Try a dish that involves the pimento cheese - trust me. It's their specialty and you won't be sorry :) It's a small place that fills up fast, so if you're going with a bigger group (4+), I would definitely call ahead. Service is great, friendly and on top of things. It's definitely going to be a place we visit regularly!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in this area.  I had the eggs Benny and the grits.  Sooooo good!!!  It is worth the wait if you have to wait for a table.  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have consistently received great service since my last review. The food and drinks have also been consistently good. This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Fort Mill!"}
{"text":"Never lets us down, 1st class food and service.....last trip had the worlds hands down, most amazing shrimp & grits ever made!
9/23/17 follow up.....better than ever!....awesome service, new layout, larger dining room makes it much more comfortable.....no need to comment on food, 1st class, cooked perfectly, great choices, fair prices...go, go, go!"}
{"text":"Stop by this time to try the breakfast menu. Again, they did an outstanding job.

I ordered the $5 buck special; in essence the Flipside Cafe breakfast; scrambled eggs, grits and biscuit with a delicious gravy. I also ordered a side of thick cut bacon, simply amazing. After multiple visits, I found something to suggest they need to improve (extremely rare @ Flipside)..gravy for the biscuit was very cold, suggestion; needs to be very hot to compliment the delicious biscuit. It's a small thing anyway. The flavors on that gravy was like going to heaven and back. Not that I have gone there, but you catch my drift. 

I know that I'm a fan, but this is such a special place. If I could only put them in my suitcase and take them home to Miami. Oh well, more reasons to return here. As always superb customer service, nice job Taelor!! 

Merry Christmas to my Flipside Cafe and Yelp friends!!"}
{"text":"Food is very fresh. Brunch menu was a bit limited but this isn't a problem. Double shots of espresso from local roasters, too! Seating is limited so maybe call ahead."}
{"text":"Had the soy chorizo and potato hash, probably the best hash of my life (food wise). The soy chorizo is better than the real thing."}
{"text":"Absolute great customer service, the atmosphere and decor is A1 & truly feels like a nice cafè!!!! I had the grilled cheese and it was PHENOMENAL!!!!!!!  DEFINITELY Will BE back often!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried dinner tonight...underwhelmed by the food.  I guess reading all the comments had me expecting mote.  I ordered the salmon with fall vegetable risotto.  The veggies were cooked perfectly but the salmon was not seasoned at all and served upside down with the skin half off.  But was pretty good after I put salt and pepper on the salmon.  My friend had the scallops and roasted Brussels sprouts....she said the scallops were excellent but I think they should rename the side Brussels sprout chips since those things were overly fried.  We finished it off with the coconut cream pie.  The crust was too thick so it broke apart easily and the filling could have been anything since the pudding had no flavor.  But our waiter checked on us frequently so no complaints about the service - I just wish the food had been better."}
{"text":"This place is consistently amazing.  Even when it's packed out and hard to find a seat, the staff is so friendly you don't mind waiting!  The food is incredible every time I go and never disappoints!  I enjoy coming on my lunch breaks and date nights.   The 5 buck chuck is the best value burger for lunches!"}
{"text":"Wicked good find in NC. This was my first time here and I was blown away by the quality. 

They take great pride in using quality ingredients from local sources.

I had the shrimp and grits and it was THE best I've ever had. This must be true because as I'm writing this review I really can't think of anywhere else that even comes to mind.

The portion sizes aren't huge but you will walk away filled and content."}
{"text":"Came here for a hearty breakfast and that's what I got! First choice was going to Crocker Barrel but usually they are constantly busy. I then decided to go somewhere local and saw this place on Yelp with very good reviews. I have to say I could justify what they say because the food is great! The establishment has a very unique homely feeling. The people are very nice and courteous. I ordered their lobster omelette which was very tasty and flavorful. Only drawback to this place is its small size which can fill up quick. Besides that I definitely would recommend to take the family to eat."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and it was excellent.  I took my wife for breakfast and we were both disappointed.  We had to send both of our plates back as everything was cold.  The grits were cheese grits ( which was not explained on the menu) and I may be in the minority, but I prefer plain and do not like cheeses.  The biscuits tasted canned and were not good.  Then I got the bill and they charge $3.00 for coffee. My bill with tip was $20.  For what we got I will not go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Best food in Charlotte! Breakfast/brunch is amazing! Staff is always friendly and gives you that hometown feeling! A family favorite for us!"}
{"text":"Really really good !  A little too close for a business lunch with a small table, but not so annoying that we didn't enjoy it.  I had the BLT with fried green tomatoes and my colleague had the kale salad.  We started with the pretzels and pimento cheese and it was great.  Lots of dip, not enough pretzels.  This area has a lot of choices for lunch and I'm glad that we chose this one"}
{"text":"Unexpected little jewel hidden in a strip center. Local grown foods and family owned care.  The attention to the food quality and prep are rare to find.  Couple that with the focus on the patrons, and this may be the coolest little breakfast spot in South Chatlotte/Fort Mill area. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"So, we start d with the White Bean Hummus and it was glorious. It was served with sliced toasted French baguettes and an array of vegetable from sliced cucumbers to Watermelon Radishes, spot on those radishes. With being being a somewhat hummus snob is was a bit skeptical but when I paired it with the WR I was hooked. A perfect start to the meal. I choose the Fortmill Bacon wrapped meatloaf, I'll let that sink in..................... I KNOW, RIGHT. How can you go wrong with bacon. Well... they didn't it was spectacular not only that it had shrooms, man... SHROOMS. Melted in my mouth and the flavors were jumping off in every direction. The just salty enough gravy, the not-to-dry hamburger, the local mushrooms, oh yeah the BACON. I mean how have I been eating and making meatloaf wrong all my life? I Blame ISIS. Anyway, the mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious as were the string beans. Our waitress, although it was slow, was VERY attentive and helpful. She steered me into the BWM as appose to choosing the Beef On Wick, which looked scrumptious. It is however not the cheapest place and it's location a bit disappointing. It's a small strip mall next to a pizza place. Patio seating would be nice and lucky we were there when it was light out. I feel that if it were dark outside, it might not be that different inside. I could see how it might be dark when having to rely on the lights there. It is cozy and could fall under the \"Romantic\" category. Too full from Neal to venture into \"Dessert Desert,\" sorry. The reason we chose this place was because the Yelp Cover Photo was a Belgian waffle so I was stomach-minded for Breakfast for dinner, which as we all know is my \"Death Row\" meal, but alas it was not to be. I will return."}
{"text":"Loved it MUCH better during my lunch experience than during my dinner experience. I thought the lunch menu was better.  Not as heavy as the dinner menu. The pricing was definitely better for lunch, which is not surprising. I am a huge Flipside Cafe fan and that is why I went back to try out the dinner experience. I wasn't disappointed,  but was not thrilled.  I suggest that they add the chicken dish from lunch to the dinner menu.  It was far superior to the dinner fried chicken.   Now that I've done dinner there, I will only be back for lunch.  Just the opinion of one."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch at around noon.  it's fairly small and was packed when ago there but no wait.  While sitting there I could see most people only had to wait a few minutes before getting a table. I guess due to location the traffic in and out was steady

Service.  Not bad but not great.  I feel the cafe needed one more server. I could tell the two that they had were in little overwhelmed.  This caused a delay in our table being cleaned off and for my coffee to be forgotten about. But the servers were pretty nice and did apologize

Food. Really, really good. I had the Flipside Breakfast which was cheddar grits, 2 eggs, bacon, and biscuits with gravy.  The eggs and bacon were ok; I felt the eggs were scrambled a little too hard and the bacon was too rubbery.  The grits and biscuit made up for it. The grits were so smooth. The gravy on the biscuits were AMAZING.  Best gravy I've had in a while. They have the biscuit and gravy as a side so try it if you get something else 

I also had a pancake on the side (yeah I'm a fat kid). That was also really good. I wish I had two.

My girlfriend had the lobster omelette and she enjoyed it. I had a taste and thought it wasn't bad. It was a little overcooked honestly. I liked my breakfast more. 

It seems the cafe turns into a little bar too at some point. They had a surprising amount of beers listed.

I really hope they open a place somewhere in Charlotte. I think they could do pretty well if it's a good location."}
{"text":"I am a freak for Southern Comfort Food.  In point of fact, one of the big allures for leaving the Aloha State for the Carolina's was the opportunity partake in good old fashioned Southern cuisine whenever my heart desired.

I've passed by the Flipside Cafe on several occasions and always kept it on the back my mind when I was craving some pimento cheese grits.  Today was my first effort to have some of their fare, but I had to do it via phone order.  I ordered their pancakes and Carolina grits as well as some biscuits and gravy to go.  They said 10 mins, but it took more like 30 when all was said and done. I must say I was surprised when I walked in; It was like a cozy Cracker Barrel.  The entire establishment was exceptionally well laid out.  

We were greeted at the door by an especially chipper waitress.  She was friendly and hurried back to the kitchen to collect our food.  Unfortunately we still had to wait for a bit while they got it together.  Fortunately because the place was so nice there was a lot to keep our eyes occupied.  

As I mentioned, we took the food to go.  The pancakes were good, but nothing to write home about.  The maple syrup was just that. No special twists there.  The biscuits were garden variety and the gravy filled the spot.  I enjoyed the seasonal variety of fruits a lot.  I also loved their Carolina pimento cheese Grits. Very good.  All in all the grits and the fruit left an impression more so than the rest.

Great little place to satisfy your most basic southern desires. It is on my way home so I'm intrigued about their dinner menu. I'll likely try it out soon during the week and update about that as well."}
{"text":"Love this spot.  The lobster omelette for breakfast, chicken salad for lunch...Gotta try dinner next.  Great food, fresh ingredients, fast service.  Unfortunately, the word is out!"}
{"text":"We took to Yelp to find a great brunch place on our way out. This was perfection. Come early! They're busy early but the wait seemed to go pretty quickly. Everyone there was really nice and helpful. We ordered the Smoked Salmon Breakfast sandwich, the special of the morning while chocolate pistachio French toast and the grits with pimento cheese and bacon jam. I don't even care for grits but these were fantastic. They came out piping hot and so good! The rest of our breakfast was terrific too except I wish they had capers in the house. If you have smoked salmon how do you not have capers lol. Anyways check this place out. I can not wait to come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast restaurant! Fantastic service, delicious using all local fresh ingredients. Had the banana crunch waffles with eggs. Solid choice but you can go wrong here. Good strong coffee too."}
{"text":"Asked for a well done steak ....got rare .. sent back and got rare a second time. Ask for syrup  on side they placed on top of waffle. The manager did not charge us and was apologetic. Customer service above average."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little Strip mall in Fort Mill is a perfect Farm to Table restaurant with a great Chef. Chef Joseph Cornett. It was our first time here and I (being a Foodie) had not really heard anything about this place. Small but smartly decorated like a Country Cafe, this was truly a pleasant surprise. We started out with the Brussel Sprouts, oven roasted and so crispy with Balsamic and sea salt!  We also had Amy's Pimento cheese with warm Pretzels....better than the fair! Just delicious! Then I had the In Season Tomato soup with Brioche Croutons, very good. The best was the Warm Asparagus Salad with a Fried Egg, Marinated Mushrooms, Kale and  fresh Parm. It was heavenly! My husband had the The Flipside Melt which was their Burger with Homemade Pimento Cheese, Bacon Jam on a Brioche with Parmesan. Really a great burger.  We ended it with their Flourless Chocolate Cake with Orange Peel Ice Cream and Brittle. Prices were reasonable and the whole Farm to Table with the Name of all the local farms and dairys' they use were clearly available for all to see. I hear they have another Restaurant in Rock Hill called The Flipside Restaurant. I will be going to try it out also...Really a Hidden Gem...."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not seen this place before.   It is a nice little Mom and Pop type place with a whole lot of Southern charm.   A \"real\" Southern comfort food joint.  Soon as we opened the door we were amazed how crowded it was for lunch and the people just kept coming in.  It's a small place packed with tables.   I ordered the pot roast paninni with was amazing.   I saw some other dishes as well that looked great,  shepherd's pie, and the burgers.   The staff was very friendly after I ate the waitress showed me the bathroom and she actually help me unzip my pants, I couldn't believe it.   JUST KIDDING!!!!!!, just wanted to see if you where actually reading this entire review.   It was a very good lunchtime experience,  I will definitely be back to sample some other plates."}
{"text":"The fried green tomato BLT was phenomenal! The waitstaff was very friendly too. The flipside cafe is a definite must!"}
{"text":"My first trip to Flipside a few weeks ago did not leave me with a great impression because of a rude waitress. I subsequently received a message from owner Jon advising that they had made improvements in service and inviting me back for a second visit. I had already planned on giving the new restaurant another shot because the food looked excellent so I stopped by with a friend in town from Winston this past Sunday for brunch. There was no sign of the aforementioned waitress (my lucky day?) and both servers were very friendly and informative. I ordered the Benne Benne, which is a slightly modified version of eggs Benedict with regular bacon instead of Canadian bacon and is quite delicious. My friend had the lobster omelette, which he loved (I noticed several other diners licking their plates after finishing this dish as well). We also split the Carolina Grits, infused with amazing pimento cheese and topped with bacon jam. 

Several of the prior reviews mentioned that cold coffee was served from thermoses. This situation has apparently been rectified as my coffee was refilled a few times directly from the carafe and was just as hot as you would want it. 

Though I didn't get a chance to meet her, I did see owner/chef Amy personally deliver a few meals. She was somewhat of a celebrity to those who had clearly been to Flipside before. 

I really, really enjoyed my second visit to Flipside Cafe. It is a quaint restaurant with great food in an area starved for dining options. This experience was good enough to make me forget about my first and I am excited to return with my wife for dinner in the near future."}
{"text":"Pros: my waffles were delicious, the decor was super cute. 

Cons: The wait was about 40 minutes, I finally had to ask how much longer it would take. Conveniently  we were the next ones to be seated. I ordered a mimosa, my friend ordered a coffee and a Diet Coke. Her drinks got there, mine didn't. The table beside us had 4 people, who were seated about 10 minutes after us. They got all 4 of their mimosas and I had to ask for mine again. They had the same waitress. 

I honestly can't say that I'd come back."}
{"text":"I would say that this is the second best restaurant in Fort Mill next to the Local Dish. the ingredients are fresh and well priced for what they are, where else can you get a seared scallop lunch for $15? The breakfast here is great; their gravy is fantastic. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This woman run kitchen is amazing. Head chef Amy ane sous chef Rachel are some of the most talented chefs in Charlotte, men or women. It is week one of this new restaurant, so I'll update after a few weeks of opening."}
{"text":"We were unfamiliar with this area and discovered this spot through a Yelp search. The breakfast was delicious and we received great service! I would definitely recommend this breakfast place to anyone near the area!"}
{"text":"Don't go for breakfast at 1055 they won't serve you. 
I'll try another time when it's not raining and cold and all I wanted was some warm coffee and breakfast. Light Rail it is"}
{"text":"I love the fact that The Flipside Cafe has a very interesting menu. At first glance this small restaurant looks like your standard deli sandwich/bag of potato chip kind of place. No Sir, it is not.

I ordered the garden squash bisque which is a flavorful butternut and apple purée. It is  garnished with kale, bacon and fig balsamic. I also ordered the white bean hummus which came with baguette toasts coated in olive oil, salt and herbs.

If you want a glass of wine or a beer, they offer lots of local choices.

The service was very good and the servers worked well with the folks who had to wait for a table even offering to seat people \"communally.\" 

If there is any negative for me it would be that almost all menu selections include bacon, ham or cheese. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it is somewhat difficult to find a light dish. The white bean hummus was fine but the toasts were very rich with the oil. What I ordered sound \"light-ish\" but I went away feeling like I had eaten a lot of fat.

I will definitely return - I love the emphasis on local ingredients."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Location is a little hidden, but definitely worth looking for. Prices were reasonable and food was excellent. We are from the Midwest and definitely a spot we would revisit if we return to the area."}
{"text":"Some friends recommended we go here for Breakfast on New Years day.  I've missed this little gem somehow, possibly due to their location and not a lot of advertisement.  Fortunately they are located really close to where I live and I am very thankful because I will definitely be back for repeat business.

The dining area is small and cozy.  Mostly 2 tops but some tables for larger parties if necessary.  We showed up for a good breakfast and they did not disappoint.  I ordered the breakfast plate with Eggs, Bacon, Grits, and Biscuit with Gravy.  The waitress said her favorite was the Benne Benne (Eggs Benedict) so I asked her to include a ram of Hollandaise for me to try on my eggs.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The grits were light and fluffy. The biscuit fluffy with ample gravy to soak up.  The eggs with the hollandaise were spot on.  My friend had the Steak and Eggs breakfast and it looked amazing!  The steak cooked perfectly and the potatoes seasoned just right.

All in all, I would most definitely recommend this little spot and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Was in the area for a meeting and a friend suggested this place. We went here for lunch and had the salmon and seafood special which was scallops. Food was very good and fresh, definitely on point with the farm to table offering. Very good value for the quality of the meal. Looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Wow Flipside! You knocked our socks off! What a great restaurant stuck in the middle of a plaza. So glad we checked this one out. Holy cow - hit up the sloppy Joe or the shrimp and grits...my baby's mac and cheese was super ridiculous good too. We've tried much more on the menu and haven't been disappointed. We will be back every time we're in town!!"}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review ever... 

I've been coming to Flipside for the last few years and I can confidently say I will never be back. 

This morning I ordered chicken and waffles and the inside of my chicken was still frozen and uncooked. 

Waitress never offered a single apologize and then took a measly 25% off the chicken. It's insulting that a 3 dollar discount is intended to make up for potential FOOD POISONING"}
{"text":"I'm glad we tried this place! Good breakfast and i loved the cheese grits. Our food was fresh and had great taste."}
{"text":"Amazing! This was definitely some of the best southern comfort food I've ever had! We went here about a week ago. It's a small cafe and is normally packed so I suggest you make a reservation. First, we got a delicious baguette with strawberry and regular homemade butter. We also got the BEST brussel sprouts that I have ever had. We then got a delicious wedge salad with blue cheese dressing and lots of toppings. The final dish was the salmon entree that came with spinach and autumn vegetables. Also, the service was good because our waitress checked on us often, but the highlight and best part of the meal of course had to be the........ bacon."}
{"text":"Love this little farm to table jewel! Consistently great food! They adapt easily to allergies if you ask!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Not a big place but fresh ingredients and they serve a quality brunch. I really like the whole grain pancakes and the grits. The bacon maple jam adds a really awesome flavor to the grits"}
{"text":"I was looking for a great hole in the wall joint with some down home cooking and boy did I find it! The place is small and doesn't look like much as you pull up, but don't let the outside perception fool ya. From the time we walked in we were greeted with great hospitality. I could tell early on that we were in for a great experience and they delivered something even better... something we call a \"red shoes experience.\"

We arrived late in the evening not long before closing, but the staff was gracious and never showed any signs of it being an inconvenience. In fact, they went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to make sure we got the full experience. What a rare treat! They made sure we became guests for life!

The food was phenomenal. We started with the pimento cheese and pretzels as well as the short ribs and grits. Wasn't sure they could be topped and then the meatloaf showed up. Then we capped it off with some amazing dessert. 

Great job by the entire team!!! See you again real soon!"}
{"text":"Drove from Mint Hill to try the place. Well worth the drive. Nicely decor and cozy place. 

Husband had the shrimp and grits which was awesome. He usually order the same boring plain grits with eggs, hash browns and links. I am glad he was adventurous this morning. He felt it was slightly on the thin side, but the flavors were there. Nice chucks of Tasso (Cajun bacon), tomatoes, and peppers. The shrimps were nice size also. 

I had the everything bagel with salmon and arugula sandwich with side of fruits. Both were good. The fruits consisted of strawberries, pineapples, melon and blueberries. The cured salmon, just right amount, pared well with the pickled red onion and arugula. 

Coffee, freshly grounded, topped of the breakfast just right. 

Recommend this place. I will definitely drive all the way here again. Bonus, gas cheaper in SC."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, a small hole in the wall gem! Great customer service and clean. I had the steak and eggs and my boyfriend had chicken n waffles.... BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD!!! Will definitely be back when in Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Small, not fancy but most of the food is very good. My husband and I particularly think the shepherds pie is excellent. Coffee NTR okay, nothing special. Although very crowded every time we were there, the service was fast and attentive and the meal came out quite quickly. It is a small café and Can feel crowded and noisy but has cute decorations. With really good food, we don't mind the casual environment."}
{"text":"Good gosh the food was great!! Woohoo, it is as good as it gets, Yelp!

Where to start? Their 5 buck chuck burger for lunch is fantastic. Get the mashed potatoes with it.. yeah, I know.. mashed potatoes with a burger? Do it. I ate lunch at noon today. It's now 8PM and I'm still not hungry. And I'm a big eater.

The meatloaf is among the best ever. It appears it's not only ground beef, but some brisket in there as well. 

We are going back their for brunch some day because that menu looked superb!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm... Let's see.... 
Went last Sunday - March 4, 2018 (First visit, and the reason we went was due to the reviews and we love to try new places.)  
I ordered the Chicken and Waffles - and a side of potatoes (I LOVE hash-browns/breakfast potatoes!!!) the others in my party ordered the steak and eggs, and some sort of lobster omelet.... (The menu states the pieces of lobster aren't small, but that remains to be seen) 
Anyway.... The steak and eggs I think were ok.... very small piece of steak. but he seemed to be ok with it, but he doesn't complain much anyway... The chicken and waffles; Yeah I was really disappointed.  the chicken was sort of flavorless... not dry but not moist either.  and do NOT expect a whole waffle, you GET HALF!!!! that is all.  the menu doesn't state this but when we ask the waitress she brought our other 1/2 just because... the potatoes... I did not like at all... not cooked throughout.  They were hard in the center and WAY too much rosemary something on them.  (I wish we had gone somewhere else to be honest. ) The lobster Omelet; looked a little overcooked on the outside (the egg was brown from cooking too long) and from what I was told the lobster in it was small and hard to find.  I have to say we will not be making a special trip here for breakfast which is a shame because we were excited about it."}
{"text":"Located in a *very* nondescript strip mall just over the South Carolina border, The Flipside Cafe is an ode to incredible, local food, good service, and excellent prices. To put it another way: oh my Jebus, this place is unfuckinbelievably awesome! 

The first thing you may notice upon walking into the airy, light-filled interior is the giant chalk board listing all of the local suppliers for their food. The Flipside seems to be truly dedicated to the craft of local restaurateuring (I know that's not a word... eh, screw it). When we walked in at 11:00 on a Sunday, the folks behind the counter were already busy preparing lunch: they were chopping large quantities of local farm-grown veggies, making the dough for savory pastries from scratch, etc.

The Sunday Brunch menu is both extensive and varied. Being the indecisive schmuck that I am, I ended up ordering \"The Flipside,\" which was really a sampler of their classic southern breakfast. How good could this be, you ask? Fuckin' stupid good, dude. So stupid good, it should ride the short bus of epicness. The eggs were fried in just the right amount of butter to make them a sinful indulgence, yet somehow managed to avoid becoming a grease fest. The bacon was chewy, full of flavor, and cooked to perfection. The cheddar in the cheese grits was blended in so that you got just the right amount of cheesy consistency in each bite. The biscuit and gravy was just OMFG: House-made biscuit with thick, but not overly dense and salty gravy. Little chunks of sausage sprinkled throughout so as not to overwhelm with porkiness in any one bite. The meal was like a breakfast orgy for my taste buds: every item brought something unique and wonderful to the table, and a good time was had by, well, me.

Guess what! They serve Counter Culture coffee! $3 and unlimited refills! So, by the time I was full, I simply levitated out of my seat and zipped out of there like one of those mini drones.

Service was friendly as could be and they always got whatever we asked for right away. One small criticism: as noted in other reviews, it felt like they really needed another server when the number of customers surpassed five. It was, at times, difficult to get our main server's attention... not necessarily her fault. 

As for prices, with coffee ($3), food ($10), tax, and tip, I got out of there for just under $17. A very reasonable price and well worth every damn penny.

Oh! And there were maybe 10 people in there on Sunday at 11 AM. WTF are you doing, Charlotte?! Go to this place! Worship at the altar of incredible food and leave a more perfect person... well, at least a fatter and very satisfied person."}
{"text":"The menu is great, they utilize many local farms & ingredients, and the service was awesome.  But that's not why I'm here. 

The perfect way to start a slightly hungover day is with their Cinnamon Crunch waffle. You know you made the right choice immediately because you can smell the waffle cooking throughout the restaurant... and that's before they top it with spiced bananas & Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal. I could wax poetic about this waffle and it's deliciousness all day but realistically I'm gonna take a nap. Do yourself a favor and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Really authentic, really laid back cute place. You can tell everything is from scratch and homemade. Service is like being in a friends kitchen, to boot mimosas before noon on Sunday! Only downfall is really small and awkward table structure, no outdoor seating. But still, go here! Support local."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a new restaurant at the front of Regent Park after Eat Well closed so quickly, and I have not been disappointed on the three visits I have made here!
Amy Fortes' (Chef and Owner, along with Jon Fortes) last gig, I'm told, was Upstream, so we are so happy for that calibre of chef to be in our little neck of the woods. She is amazing and so hospitable! Each visit she has been on the floor making sure all her customers are doing well. The service has always been efficient, but warmly friendly for us. 
Amy specializes in local fare, and the current vendors are listed on the board over the coffee bar. The following farmers were listed when we visited: Tega Hills Farm, Barbee Farms in Concord, as well as Counter Culture Coffee in Durham, NC among several others.
The menu is limited but covers a range of tastes and is highly creative. Servings are not large, but I found they were more than adequate, and my taste buds were totally satisfied.
I went twice for dinner. I had the Flipside Melt, their signature hamburger: wonderful Brioche bun; fabulous Pimento Cheese with T.O.P. jam and perfectly crispy Potato Wedges. My BF had Amy's Shepard Pie, made with Braised Shortribs, which she loved. We also split the Flipside Bibb, a salad made with Peppadews (slightly sweet & spicy), Blue Cheese, Buffalo Bacon and a tasty Vinaigrette.
Next time I had the Roasted Salmon with Asparagus Noodles, Grits (not a big fan but loved these because they were flavored with) Bacon Jam and Smoked Tomato Cream. Salmon was perfectly cooked and I loved the combination of sauce flavors, which seems to be something Amy excels at. My husband had the Iron Skillet Roasted NY Strip served with Potato Purée, Wilted Kale and Charred Onion Butter. Once again, cooked perfectly and so flavorful.
When I went for Brunch, I and my BFF had the Lobster Quiche with Bacon, Asparagus, Smoked Cheddar and Fruit. The filling was very flavorful, although the crust itself was dry. (Someone else I know had a muffin and was unimpressed so baking may not be their forte.) My husband had a Benne! Benne! their version of Eggs Benedict which was melt in your mouth wonderful!
Here's hoping they get enough business at this location to stay longer than Eat Well, who was also pretty good. They are really already cramped, especially on Sundays (not a good time to go!)."}
{"text":"Always a great experience no matter if it's breakfast or dinner. Only downside is that the menu is updated frequently and many dishes I've enjoyed are no longer available. 

Be sure to try the Carolina grits. They will change your life!!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! First time here and it won't be the last. I got the chicken and waffles, others got the blueberry pancakes and the flipside breakfast in the blue box on the menu. 
Everything was delicious! The potatoes were also great! Highly recommend and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely great place for farm fresh brunch.  Our server was very friendly.  Highly recommend when in the area. Would like to check out dinner one day."}
{"text":"I'd give 10 stars if u could! Service was fast, food was delicious ( and all local might I add). The coffee was some of the best I've ever had and the atmosphere highly enjoyable. It's 30 minutes away from me but well worth the drive every time"}
{"text":"we only got to here for restaurant week, so i don't know that i got to experience everything i wanted to experience--but i'm still a huge fan! the food was soooo good. don't let the strip mall fool you, cuz it's a delicious little eatery in here. it's not super fancy inside (and it seems small), but it has some fancy food. it's a farm-to-table type of restaurant, and they do a great job of making everything fresh and also pretty."}
{"text":"Phenomenal southern cooking. The shrimp and grits was to die for! Salmon sandwich was also very, very yummy. Friendly staff, slightly eclectic atmosphere, and absolutely great food. Don't miss it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Nice quaint restaurant with a nice aroma.The best breakfast I had in a while. Everything was delicious! From the blueberry pancakes & breakfast special with pimento cheese grits to the shrimp and grits, it's worth every dollar!"}
{"text":"Love this place especially the food and the atmosphere. I had the grits with bacon jam and pimento cheese and was not disappointed. We will definitely be back to try out the lunch and dinner menu. The Flip Side Cafe also supports local farmers and growers another huge plus!!"}
{"text":"Delicious homemade blueberry pancakes and a buttermilk biscuit was was the best start to a Saturday morning.  The service was great and enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"They always have delicious food! I only wish that the portions were a little larger. The green beans are my favorite they are always fresh and so crunch its like a french fry but better. I would go all the time but my boyfriend complains he never gets full and always pays a lot of money. Its a great place for lunch with a girlfriend or a special event."}
{"text":"I have been absolutely amazed at this place. Small in structure but BIG in taste, service and attitude! The Flipside burger is unblievably delicious! We have been multiple times and it has been perfect in every way. A must go! Can be busy, only has a dozen small tables, but it's worth the wait! Try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Outstanding unique breakfast/brunch spot. Lobster omelette and pimento cheese grits with bacon jam outstanding. Service was top notch and what nice people they are!"}
{"text":"Really good food... even better is the price.

Got the green tomato blt.  It was great!  Good bread, lots of bacon, the fired tomato was a good addition.

Bacon apple bread pudding was amazing as well.  I am in town for work and this is the 5th bread pudding I have had in the last week!  This is probably the best one.  

Make sure you get dessert."}
{"text":"The Cinnamon Toast Crunch waffles were amazing!!! But, the orders of bacon were cooked semingly different yet both overlooked, one was burnt to dust the other was over cooked in a jerky kinda way. Couldn't eat it. So for that, a star is lost."}
{"text":"Amazing and unique breakfast's! They vary the menu and always something new and tasty. The food is plenty for a tasty breakfast without over eating. New space added was a welcome addition as they are busy. Love eating breakfast here."}
{"text":"This small sized cafe has big heart. The owner and head chef, Amy, is personable and caring. Her menu showcases tasty southern classics with a twist. The white cheddar Pimento Cheese dip, Potatoes Brava, Mac and Cheese meatloaf, and Chop Salads, and the Shepard's Pie are some of my favorites. 

The Flipside Cafe supports and purchases produce from local farms which is another reason to feel good about coming in. 

Since it is such a small place it can get a bit crowded during lunch but it's a friendly atmosphere and I would definitely recommend it to friends nonetheless.

Amy and the staff are really great!"}
{"text":"It helps that Flipside is a hidden gem in an area that has few good options. But add to that the friendly and knowledgeable staff (shout out to Andrea!), the owners on premises working their tails off, and OMG fresh food, I'm not telling anyone about my new fave lunch place. Oh wait....
Anyhoo, I had the squash bisque, perfect for Autumn, and the mushroom ravioli. The mushrooms were divine. Coworker had meatloaf Mac & cheese and he raved. Other coworker had the chuck burger and says is coming back to order it with the potatoes (note: chuck burger special is a la carte so you must order the side separately). We all decided we're going back to try so many other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I passed the Flipside Cafe while getting ice cream next door on a Saturday and I'd never noticed it before so I came home and checked the yelp reviews.  They got rave reviews so I got up the following Sunday morning and was excited to share my new brunch discovery with my husband and roommate.  

We got there at 11:15am trying to avoid the church folks.  I was surprised that there were only 2 other tables when we arrived.  (I would later figure out why)  It was a lot smaller than I anticipated, and it was kinda warm due to the crazy tall ceiling and the kitchen that's open to the dining area.?.  There were far more employees than customers and though the employees all seemed young and \"hip\" they were also very polite and efficient.

Ok, now the food.  It seems to be local focused and the items we ordered were indeed tasty.  I gave a 2 star solely based on the price, not on the taste.  I knew this place was going to be more expensive than we're used to paying for eggs and toast, but WOW!  We got 2 of their Benne! Benne! and they were both very tasty, but both very small.  Imagine: one English muffin, 2 poached eggs, hollandaise sauce and some crispy, flash sautéed asparagus for $9...  with no side or drink.  Really?  There is no \"side\" with this which I was really surprised by.  I ordered some of their $5 Carolina grits just so we could taste them as they'd gotten great reviews... and OMG! They are the best grits EVER!  They come in a sizzling square cast iron skillet.  Maybe not worth $5.00, but pretty darn good :-)  My roommate ordered 2 eggs over medium and bacon.  He got simply 2 eggs and some bacon... no toast, no side.  He drank coffee (which was $3!) while we both ordered cokes.  I was shocked to get a 20 oz bottle and a glass with ice, and was even more shocked to be charged $2.00 each for them!!  The plates they use are cute, but they're slightly rounded so cutting anything on them without them falling over and making a mess is nearly impossible.  I found this to be a real issue with my Benne! Benne! that needed to be cut into bite sized pieces :-(

My fellas were not at all impressed with The Flipside Café; they were still hungry when we left so we stopped at Bojangles on our way home so they could get more breakfast.  Our food from The Flipside Café was all very tasty, but not enough of anything and all very overpriced for what you actually get.  Our bill was $43 at the end and I tipped the waitress well because she was enjoyable and efficient, but for $50 I expect to leave full and satisfied, maybe even having had a bloody mary :-(  I'm sad to say that though it was all tasty, we will not be back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast places in Fort Mill. Love the cinnamon crunch waffle. Only issue is they need a broader menu, and some more traditional items, because sometimes it's hard to pick from the small selection of odd menu items."}
{"text":"We kept hearing how good this place was, so we finally got around to trying their brunch.  I had the pancakes and they were good.  Another person at our table had their biscuit and gravy and they enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place mainly because I love Brunch. After a long Friday night and I slept in and missed their breakfast hours. I was so disappointed because I didn't see any of the items I wanted to try but decided to stay and give their lunch menu a try. 

Not to worry I was pleased with what we selected. The fried green tomato BLT was amazing even though I'm not a fan of pimento cheese."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!!!! Best service ever!! Definitely gave our waitress a nice tip! She said to try the Benne,Benne so I did. Best advice!!!!! Loved everything about this restaurant. I always thought Toast was the place to go for breakfast, NOPE! Flipside Cafe is now the only place I will go for breakfast. My husband and I will definitely be back to tryout their lunch and dinner menus! He had the steak and eggs with potatoes! I had the Benne (poached egg with bacon on a English muffin with hollandaise sauce and a side of asparagus). Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Food-Good. Great selection and all the dishes are very interesting. 
Service-Good. The server was very sweet and friendly and answered all our questions. 
Tea-I'm really surprised a place like this doesn't have sweet tea!! They give you unsweet tea with a little sweet syrup on the side. It is not good. The syrup didn't make my tea sweet at all and it's really messy to do the whole process for a glass of sweet tea.
Atmosphere-It's ok. It's small. We got sat at the high tops. The stools have no back so it was really uncomfortable to eat and since the restaurant is small, I kept getting hit and bumped. 

I would definitely try this location again but I'm gonna have to ask for low top seating and I will get juice next time. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast excellent choices for different types of breakfast food. The prices are reasonable and they have a great coffee selection, definitely an awesome Sunday brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was awesome and within reach from the North/South Carolina border and South Carolina rest stop.  We drove in an RV and parked about a block away.  It would have been worth unhooking the toad and leaving the RV at the rest stop if needed.  Anyway, there is a full bar, good cocktails (bloody mary, espresso martini) and the food is wonderful.  South Carolina fair of Shrimp and Grits and Biscuits and Gravy with a slight twist.  We were just passing through, but it made a spot on our GPS for the next trip.  Service was stellar.  Restroom were clean and maintained."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by some close friends. I couldn't wait to try the place out being that I love breakfast food. The food and service were not disappointing but the amount of food was. I got the chicken and waffle for 10.00 and it was literally half a waffle and 3 chicken strips. It was very good but just not enough food for me. May try them again and get something else."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this gem by mistake and it was the best mistake I ever made. I ordered the Shrimp and Grits which came highly recommended by our server Jerri. She was awesome and so was this dish. I can't wait to get back, to try everything on the menu. I think the lobster omelet will be next. My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Were here from out of town.  We are from Texas and steak lovers.  We went for breakfast and we all had the steak and eggs.  Delicious steak perfectly seasoned and cooked surprisingly.  It was cooked better then the ateak I got earlier in the week at a local Texas Roadhouse .  Eggs were over cooked but flavor was good, and potatoes with I believe feta cheese topped it off.  Hoping to try lunch.  It is a smaller restaurant kind of like a NYC feel to it."}
{"text":"Everything was very good, the smoked Rosemary home fries were the best, grits were nice and creamy (you know that means they put love in them) bacon was nice and crisp, fresh bread, OMG  homemade sweet butter.."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch. The food was very good and the service was great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place had plenty of menu options to choose from. Their grits with bacon jelly are to die for. I had the Eggs Benedict and it was delicious. You've got to come in early otherwise you'll be waiting."}
{"text":"I haven't been back in awhile, but had (yet another) fabulous lunch here. I got there at noon and my friend had already gotten a table. The place was full, but only a couple people looked like they were waiting. 
Looks like some construction is going on inside...expanding? I like the \"smallness\" of FSC, but being able to accommodate more people is a good thing, too. 

My friend had the mountain trout on a jambalaya type rice. I didn't taste it, but it looked great and he said it was. I however, had the warm asparagus salad. The egg comes over easy and I asked for over medium because I can't risk an undone white. Unfortunately, the egg arrived fried hard so I didn't get any runny yolk that would have been great. That did not keep the dish from being stupendous  (ha! who uses that word?). The grilled asparagus was delicious and the mushrooms had a good earthy taste. The kale side treatment was a tad woody, but again, the flavors were spot on. This is not a light dish, rather very rich so be prepared - I was delighted. 
Why five stars this time?? Well well well, somebody did some coffee magic. It was dark and delicious."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant group. Love that most of the food is sourced locally by local farms. Their daily fresh catch special tends to be excellent. Salads, sandwiches and the chuck burger all made fresh and with special unique flavor and appeal. Decent tap beer selection as well. They also have a location in Rock Hill and one in Pineville. Try them out, each are a bit different and have different menus."}
{"text":"Do not overlook this excellent local restaurant tucked away in a strip mall.  They have a great inventive, fresh and locally sourced menu.  We had a fun and enjoyable dinner by trying multiple small plates, and a couple of desserts - all excellent.   Service was also excellent.   We'll definitely be back to continue working down the menu."}
{"text":"Had the 5 buck chuck and potatoes. Was excellent and flavorful.   Cute little place tucked away in a strip of shops. Can't wait to go back and try one of the other great dishes they have to offer. Saw several other delicious meals coming out for other tables. Service was great."}
{"text":"Hands down best shrimp n grits I have had At any restaurant.  Side salad I ordered was a little meh but I don't think that is what you eat at an establishment such as this.  I will be back to try the jambalaya soon. I can't wait!"}
{"text":"OMG. I don't where to start with how great this restaurant is. My wife and I came in for breakfast on a Saturday. We were greeted warmly and seated right away.
I had coffee which was really delicious and my wife had tea which she liked a lot.
We started with a Mystery Muffin, blueberry, which came out nice, warm, and toasted.
My wife ran to the chicken and waffles which we both absolutely loved. Real maple syrup. Fresh fruit which was great as well.
I had the bacon, cheddar and poblano pepper omelet. Delicious. My side was a potato dish with herb creme fraiche. The perfect complement to the omelet.
Our server Lauren was awesome and really attentive.
All in all we will absolutely come back here. Best breakfast ever."}
{"text":"Omg. I love this gem of a restaurant in a random strip mall in Ft. Mill. The soup was to-die for and our toddler gushed over the Mac and Cheese - (he begged us to \"come back sometime\" and that NEVER happens)! Everything is fresh and the service is great..... We'll be regulars soon - there was nothing sub-par. However, make reservations on Friday or Saturday nights or you'll be turned away between 6-8 pm."}
{"text":"This food exceeded my expectations by far! The gravy on the meatloaf is out of this world and the asparagus is top notch. I wish I'd discovered this place earlier into my vacation!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite restaurant.
The food is fantastic. Staff is courteous. There is never is huge crowd so its not loud.

If you like good food eat here."}
{"text":"Today's venture to The Flipside was a \"swing and a miss\".  It started with the staffing. When the doors opened at 09:00 AM there were about 8-10 patrons waiting . After being seated it became apparent that there were more patrons than the initial 2 waitresses could effectively accomodate. A 3rd waitress joined the staff at around 9:21. I ordered the Maine Lobster Omlet and my wife ordered The Flipside Breakfast. We had both previously had the FSB and enjoyed it. However today my wife's grits were cold and the coffee was luke warm. The waitress brought my wife another bowl of grits.....still cold.  NOT GOOD.  The disappointing part of this exchange is that the waitress didn't offer to reduce the cost of the meal or offer a raincheck. Chances are that we ll go back at some point,  just not soon.  When it's not right for the customer it should be the goal of the establishment to make it right. I'm just saying...."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife and some friends a couple of weeks ago for lunch.  A quaint little place with wonderful staff and servers.  The food was outstanding (we tried a little of many things).  Definitely a place we will return to."}
{"text":"Food was good... above average. I like they advertise that all their food is locally purchased. Always nice to see.

The wait is long which is probably due to the very small space they cram people into to accommodate the demand. Would LOVE to go back, but the wait and the tightness inside, I think I'll try ordering out. But again, great food"}
{"text":"Amy's pimento cheese, and Brussels sprouts are to die for, as is the burger...  Truly everything is amazing!!  I hope it keeps the charm now that the new large store has opened in rock hill."}
{"text":"This is our second time eating here, first for a weekend. Our first time was a couple of months ago when we came during the week while house hunting. Now that we are settled here, we came back to try the place out for a weekend brunch. This time around, our breakfast was even better than the first time (which would have also been 5 stars). Even though the place was a little busy, it did not take long to get a seat. The restaurant was easily able to handle the volume of customers flowing in. Service was never lacking and always attentive. Breakfast itself was flawless - the best I've honestly have had from a place in a long, long time. Prices are on the high side, so it is definitely a treat. Top notch all the way. Great place!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! Love me some Flipside! Whenever my boyfriend and I are in Fort Mill visiting we come here! The chicken and waffles are my favorite. Additionally, they have the best sourdough toast of all time. I almost slipped and busted my booty on their slippery floors twice though, but I don't even care! Love this place"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  The food was great and the atmosphere was very homey feeling.  I had the pretzels with pimento cheese, the 5 Buck Chuck hamburger and the asparagus and kale salad.  All three made me want to come back for dinner.  Very pleasant and attentive wait staff too."}
{"text":"This place is good and love that they buy from local farms! The restaurant is small so I would expect to wait if busy. Didn't have to at 8pm on a Friday. We started with the gnocchi appetizer. The pork belly was awesome but only one small piece. The rest of the dish was a little bland, not much flavor. Can tell the gnocchi are homemade and fresh. I got the short ribs which were great, very tender. The pimento bread pudding was ok, I traded with my husband as I thought the mashed potatoes were better. He got the meatloaf which he liked. I would say overall everything was good but not great. With a glass of wine and one beer was about $70 with tip. Would return to try more. Service was ok but our waitress was awkward and not sure why."}
{"text":"Worst walk in experience ever.  I was in the shopping center and just stopped in to see what they offered. When approached by waitress and asked how many I said I thought this was a bakery.  With an attitude she then said does it look like a bakery? ( yes it does) I decided just to look at them menu just in case I wanted to come back for dinner sometime.  After a few minutes another waitress asked me if I am going to order anything or not? I replied by putting down the menu and leaving. I was hoping to find a new place to have dinner with my friends. But since this rude experience I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Possibly the best restaurant in Fort Mill. The food is delectable, I haven't had anything yet that hasn't caused audible expressions of satisfaction. They use as much local and fresh ingredients as possible.

The potatoes are incredible. The pretzels and pimiento cheese is not of this world, an angel comes down from the heavens to supply The Flipside Café with the ingredients (I'm about 95% sure of that). It really needs to come with more pretzels though, it only comes with 2. I'm leaving a full 5 stars though in hopes that this review will be read and next time I'm there it will come with at least 3.

This is honestly an amazing restaurant though, everyone must try it."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday breakfast and didn't have a wait for our party of 3. Service was awesome - very attentive. Food was excellent, especially the cheese grits and potatoes. Will be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Sometimes there is a wait so go early. It is farm to table so you can have a guilt free conscience. All food is uniquely prepared so you can't go wrong with anything on the menu but I suggest the Brussel sprouts and going for brunch."}
{"text":"Great service, photo and atmosphere.  Great spot for brunch.  Try the granola and smoked salmon sandwich - delish!"}
{"text":"Went again for brunch this time and as always it was outstanding. We had the special, krispy kreme french toast. Another great experience!"}
{"text":"Owner immediately contacted me and apologized. Was very impressed with the call the next day and follow up. Thank you. We are going there this week with the family again. 




I originally wrote a five star review but after two lunches here that were pretty bad, I have to change my review. Not sure if there is a different team at lunch but bringing colleagues here, the lunches have been pretty amateur hour. I talked this place up so much to my friends, and they both thought it was pretty mediocre. I ordered the chopped salad which was just thrown on a plate, see picture. They gave me brown avocado two times in a row. When I complained the first time the waitress just seemed annoyed and told me it was just oxygen and there's nothing wrong with it. My friend ordered the meatloaf mac & cheese and didn't even touch half of his meal saying it was pretty bland with no flavor.  We also got the pimento cheese dip, the dip was great but the pretzels were completely over cooked some what rock hard. 

I hope you guys step it up at lunch because I'm not sure I'm returning for dinner either."}
{"text":"Several months ago we came back and the servers and hostess were very confused; our orders were wrong and we complained. The manager came out and gave us cards and profusely apologized; so I hoped it was a one-off and didn't change my review. 
Today we came in for brunch, and the front end of the house is either WOEFULLY undertrained or understaffed. They seem super overwhelmed and severely lacking in communication. Our server was terribly frazzled and forgetful. We had to flag her down to wait on us. Then she forgot our drinks. Then she forgot our app (potatoes Bravos); after I reminded her, she went back and got it. We then had to remind her we needed utensils. She forgot the avocado mayo we asked for until she saw me sitting looking at her as she meandered around confused in the DR, THEN forgot the pancakes my bf ordered with his breakfast. Very irritating when you are waiting on something for your meal. After we asked, she brought the pancakes after we'd finished. She blamed it on the kitchen (not). She only offered to refill our drinks finally after we were finished. We had to go ask her for our check - and even after that it took her forever. Very very confused and forgetful; makes for a poor dining experience.
The hostess is doing ENTIRELY too much and should not be busing and serving during busy hours but attending the hostess stand; she is frazzled and it is irritating to customers because she can't do everything well at the same time.
I get the feeling the front end of the house doesn't have a separate manager and servers are getting trained by other poorly trained servers and no restaurant 101 at all; someone here needs to find out how that works!
Will go back; hopefully will see an improvement and will update. The food is still good."}
{"text":"Just ok!  I got the salmon bagel sandwich and had to get a ginger ale an hour later because I felt sick.  If you order that then do not get the deviled egg mayo...gross!  The salmon was not fresh.  We ordered a pancake to share and it was one of the worst we ever tasted.  My husband ordered the lobster omelet with grits and said it was good.  I tasted his omelet and thought it was ordinary, I've had much better!  Coffee was a little watery and not strong.  And I am giving this spot two stars especially because of the service.  One of the waitresses was trying to seat a table behind me and rudely decided to scoot me in my chair at the table so the little kids behind me can sit down, she didn't ask nicely or say excuse me.  I was so crunched in my seat that my husband had to move the whole table back.  She then came by and only asked him if he wanted a refill, so obviously she had some problem.  I felt a little uncomfortable eating at this place...probably will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm giving back the four stars. Been here a couple times since and this place has not disappointed. They have expanded, so now they have a bar and a dining rooms I ordered the pimento cheese grits with bacon jam. Oh shit!!!!! It was De-fuckin-licious!! The biscuits and gravy are still the best I've ever gotten. Shrimp and grits on point. I got the kids style in an adult portion. Fresh, plump shrimp sitting in those cheesy grits with green onions.
Damn!! Ok. Just eat there. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great little spot for brunch! Bacon Jam Grits were my Jam!!!
Great atmosphere and the Owner ever can out and talked with us. Glad to have this local place so close."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time eating here for Sunday breakfast. There is always a good crowd and a little busy but we never have to wait long for a seat. 

All these food is local and I love that they don't have a super long menu, there is no way not to find an awesome meal here.

I got the flipside breakfast. Eggs were cooked great, the grits where savoy and not overly salty, and the sausage gravy had great flavor, not bland like some can be. To top it off their bacon is awesome. Thick cut, and not to salty or greasy.

The guy got the BLT, delicious! The arugula & mayo were perfect. Also the coffee is on point!

Look forward to the next time."}
{"text":"This is a small tightly seated little place in a strip mall that will really surprise you. The food and ingredients are freshly sourced from local farms and prepared and presented with a much better than normal amount of flavor and creativity. I loved it."}
{"text":"Had a rough night? Tough week? Can't find breakfast? Awwww I'm sorry!! What can I say? Turn that frown upside down and flip it around @ the Flipside Cafe! I mean, where else?!? The Flipside Cafe offers all the breakfast/brunch items that could give you the perfect kickstart to your day. The chicken and waffles and the Cinnamon Toast Crunch waffle were flippin' (see what I did there ;)) karazee good!"}
{"text":"My son and I visited the place and ordered salmon and new york strip steak.
  I ordered the salmon with side salad, the salad was very old, and the steak extremely cooked, we requested to change it, and waited a long time. and this time I was very raw.
It is not what I expected and I think I would not return. the waitress very slow and with bad manners."}
{"text":"my wife, son and i stopped in this past saturday.  we fell in love.  will definitely be returning.  yum yum yummy.  a must try."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous.  We got the steak & eggs with a side of the pimento cheese grits.  We should have stopped there because that was enough to feed 3 people!  But we also got the crunchy cinnamon waffle which was unique, and very tasty.  Those grits though... I will always remember those!  It was my first time having grits.  I am told that they are rarely cooked and flavored well, but these were excellent!  The potatoes that came with the steak and eggs were perfectly soft in the middle but crispy on the outside as well.

The reason I took off 1 star.  And please, I don't mean to be offensive towards the owner, but you NEED to do something about your bathrooms.  I don't know what the men's room looked like, but the women's room was absolutely disgusting.  I thought I walked into a nasty dive bar's bathroom.  There are splatters and stains all over the wall.  The door around the knob and towards the bottom are like, stained black from fingers touching it over the years.  I just don't know how management could use that bathroom every day and not think to themselves, damn, we need to buy a $20 can of paint, or some damn cleaner at least and clean these walls!"}
{"text":"The service was incredible. Our server was probably one of the best servers I have ever had. She was attentive and friendly but not in a \"I need a new friend\" type of way. The food left a little to be desired, but it wasn't bad. The potatoes my fried ordered were good, but the flip side breakfast I ordered was simply okay. I enjoyed the trendy atmosphere. There's not a lot of space, so I would definitely steer clear on busier days."}
{"text":"Cinnamon crunch maple waffle / Steak and eggs was yummy! A little small inside. Busy by 945-10 for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Good food and owner is true believer in hospitality!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast for the first time. I ordered the lobster omelette and it was delicious. And, our waiter was wonderful. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"First visit won't be my last. Went for a late Saturday brunch. My wife had the potatoes and chorizo dish and it was pretty tasty. The chorizo is a non-meat product but you couldn't tell from the taste. Very good for the vegetarians out there. I had the Biscuit Bake which is a couple of their amazing biscuits covered in sausage gravy, topped with bacon, a good amount of cheddar cheese an two eggs. Absolutely amazing. We split an order of the blueberry pancakes and whole a bit on the thin side, still good. Definitely looking forward to my next visit to try some of the other items."}
{"text":"Food was good. But only three stars because the thirty minute wait was for a table that was not occupied when we arrived but needed to be cleared and set. Pace of staff seemed to be very slow. Will try it again."}
{"text":"First time here by choosing the closest, and highest scored by yelp breakfast and the food was phenomenal! Local eggs, best coffee, eclectic atmosphere! Service by Andrea was superior! I'm definitely coming back! Oh, my sister and I found out they've recently been awarded \"best grits\".. They have our seal of approval!"}
{"text":"Excellent cafe that supports local farmers' products. Staff is very friendly and wait time for food prep was well better than average, despite being packed! The food tasted excellent. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The small, unassuming cafe is a true hidden gem! At my age, it is rare that I have what I consider to be a \"taste sensation,\" but this special little place gave me more than one on this visit.

My wife and I ate there for Sunday brunch this past weekend. The food was some of the best breakfast food that I've had in many years. I had the Maine Lobster Omelet with a side of bacon. My wife had the yogurt with granola and fresh fruit.

Taste sensation #1...In all honesty, the omelet wasn't what I was expecting. Rather than being filled with a creamy seafood sauce, there were many textures that you could literally taste. There was enough cheese in the omelet to make it creamy, but the lobster and asparagus are what set the dish apart. The lobster was plentiful and tasty, and the asparagus was fresh and crunchy, but not overpowering.

Taste sensation #2...The bacon.....I don't know where to start singing its praise. It was thick cut, had a very smoky taste, but was cooked to perfection. It was easily some of the best bacon I've ever had.

Taste sensation #3...The final success was the coffee. I apologize for not remembering the name, but it was a locally roasted grind that they use (call Amy...she can give you all the details). This was rich and full flavored, but without a single hint of bitterness or bite that is so typical of most coffee. I always drink my coffee with cream, but this coffee literally does not need cream. It was very smooth. I plan to bring some home when I'm back in the area.

My wifes yogurt was also very good, and the fresh fruit was the perfect compliment.

When I left, I shared with the owner that I was truly sad that I had to stop eating. It was a dining experience that will not be forgotten anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had the Salman BLT with fries and it was GREAT! The fries by themselves were awesome! I sat at the bar and the guy that waited on me was friendly and so was the Manager. The place was also pretty packed. The only thing I didn't like was the menu was kinda limited. I went durning lunch. I look at the pictures on Yelp before going and saw a few things I wanted but once I got there they were not on the menu I think they change it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The End."}
{"text":"This is a great little place! The pimento cheese and bacon grits are amazing. It's a little hard to find but well worth it. Amy, the owner, does a great job and is very friendly."}
{"text":"Dinner menu is great.  The 3 of us each had separate items.  The chief has done an excellent job of blending flavors of each entree as well as the companion sides.  

Service was great as well and we were well tended."}
{"text":"I MUST endorse the shrimp & grits. So glad they didn't put twice as much in the bowl!!"}
{"text":"Kudos for the quality of the food. These guys are real chefs and I applaud their venture. I watched other people walk in expecting $5 pancakes and waffles and so I share on this review, don't compare this to an IHOP, it would be an insult. This is what breakfast should taste like, and worth every penny. But if IHOP a is what you're looking for, keep going. To the owners and chefs and wait staff, well done! I wish more Restauranteurs had the know how and courage to do it this way!!! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The food is very good but my carry out orders seem to slip though the cracks every time I eat here. This must be the norm for this establishment. It took almost 30 minutes for a pimento grilled cheese sandwich and the blond haired waitress didn't express any concern or apologies for what I thought was a long wait."}
{"text":"Call the U-Haul, pack your bags, get a new job and relocate to Fort Mill just so you can be close to Flipside Cafe and eat there every single day.  That's my plan and I hope you follow me.  This cafe made me so very happy and I wish there were more of them around Charlotte.  Seriously, it was awesome on so many levels.  Where do I start...

I love them because they are local and support local farms
I love them because they are no frills--just solid food, friendly service
I love them because they serve beer, wine and coffee
I love them because they have fresh ingredients, made to order (finally a place that asked how we wanted our burgers cooked which = NOT FROZEN)
I love them because they have a white bean hummus served with local bread, lightly sprinkled with butter that makes you want to backflip.  We had a party of 4 and ended up ordering 2 because it was that good.
I love them because they are reasonably priced
I love to love them.

They have great menu options from soups to salads, burgers to meatloaf, desserts, etc.  We tried the turkey chili, flipside salad (avacado, bacon, roasted chicken, blue cheese, citris/vinegar dressing), pimento cheese burgers and of course the white bean hummus.  We didn't try the desserts but I will say we saw apple pie a la mode being served to a neighboring table and it looked divine!  Carolina Creamery is RIGHT next door if you would want to get a scoop of icecream instead!  

Friendly service, excellent quality.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Maybe my hopes were up for breakfast and I was distraught by the fact that they stopped serving it when I got there.  Maybe that is what has affected my opinion.

I ordered coffee as it was cold and rainy outside.  And, i thought... a perfect complement for my soon to be served \"breakfast for lunch\"... but alas.

The coffee was horrid.  You could tell it was on the burner for too long.  I sent it back and was offered a fresh cup but I declined.

I ordered the meatloaf mac and cheese.  Its a very small portion.  Be aware of that if you are a big eater.  The meatloaf was pretty good but nothing special abut the mac and cheese.  Not bad just not memorable.

Service is very friendly.  Its a small place with tables close to one another but surprisingly was not very loud even with every table taken when I was there.  I will consider going back... for breakfast!  :-)"}
{"text":"Our experience here was less than impressive. The entrees were mediocre and service was slow and non attentive. 
We might give it another chance based on so many great reviews and chalk it up to an off day. 
I gave three stars instead of two for atmosphere and the pimento dip with warm pretzel appetizer....pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"On a whim my husband and I decided to go to Flip Side Cafe for Sunday brunch.  I was nervous because 1) they are relatively new and 2) the reviews on Yelp are mixed.  However, we had a perfectly pleasant meal and found the waitstaff attentive and friendly.

When we arrived there were plenty of tables available and we were told to sit wherever we wanted. Our waitress came within moments to let us know what kind of beverages were available.

We spent a minute or two looking at the brunch menu and when the waitress came back with our drinks, we placed our order.  The food was out in quick order.  I had the poached eggs while my husband had the grits and gravy biscuits.  All of the food was delicious and cooked to perfection - the pimento grits, in particular, were creamy and wonderful.  The waitress was very friendly and came by to check on us a couple times while we ate, refilling my husband's coffee each time.

Don't be fooled by it's humble location (in a strip mall) - it's good food at decent prices!  We will definitely be going back to try the place for dinner."}
{"text":"Consistently the best food in Fort Mill. The mac & cheese is insane, the crab cakes app, the steak perfectly mid rare. I can't say enough about this restaurant, so good. Pricey for Fort Mill, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on our way to Charlotte, after my Aunt recommended it.  My Aunt is a local and knows how much I LOVE lobster.  I had the Lobster Omelette and my wife had the cinnamon toast crunch waffle.  Both were great.  I added a little hot sauce to my omelette, but not enough to overpower the flavor of the cheese and lobster.  The waffle was great.  Lightest waffle I've ever had, but I appreciated that.  Mimosas were good.  Service was awesome!"}
{"text":"This was seriously one of the best breakfasts we have had in SC and in NC. Great portions and well thought out food that does not need additional seasoning or ketchup..etc. its fresh, sustainable and downright delicious!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Carolina Grits with pimento cheese and bacon jam...need I say more? When the server dropped off the cast iron skillet of grits, I saw 3 other people ask about it and promptly order the same as well. If this place keeps it up, they will quickly out grow their space."}
{"text":"Served with a bit of a Southern cuisine touch plus lots of Southern hospitality, this very small cafe did a brisk business on this weekend morning! It was the bacon and cheddar omelet that caught my eye on the menu.

A few minutes later, my omelet arrived. It was only okay. Lots of bacon and cheddar, but it was rather dry. It was served with fresh seasonal fruit, but it really needed a biscuit or some toast. Next time, I'll have something else.

$3 for coffee. I did get my money's worth drinking about four cups. It was decent coffee and the gals did a good job at keeping my cup filled.

Overall, it was good and I'm a fan. But when I return, I'll have something else."}
{"text":"Muffins to die for. My new favorite breakfast meal with biscuits and gravy and bacon and scrambled eggs with onions. Fresh fruit to end with. Filled for the day. Did I mention the blueberry muffin warmed in hakfvon the grill?"}
{"text":"I'm not from the area, and this was probably one of the best breakfast experiences I had on this southern coast road trip. We were on our way to Roanoke from Savannah and made a stop based on reviews, and I gotta say the place blew my expectations away. 

At first I was somewhat surprised at a relatively small menu but I realized this is how they make each dish shine. The ingredients are locally sourced and everything is made from scratch, even the hot chocolate! I ordered an Eggs Benedict and it was out of this world. My dad ordered the Maine lobster omelet not expecting much lobster, but we found giant chunks of the good stuff! Brother ordered a waffle with a side of eggs. The smells emanating from the kitchen were mouthwatering. Service was fast and friendly. Pricing was reasonable. 10/10."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way to Florida due to great reviews on Yelp!!! Sylveena was a friendly & quick server food & mimosa were amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped her for lunch with some coworkers. The ambiance is very casual and family friendly. I got the crab Cake BLT with Brussels. It was beyond amazing! The Brussels sprouts were crispy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick bite to eat but not the fast food feel."}
{"text":"The Flipside came highly recommended from locals that know good food and good places to get it. The Flipside came highly recommended by many of the local neighbors and eventually we stopped in for a visit.  It's an upscale neighborhood real southern establishment.  The Fried Green Tomatoes, Shrimp and Grits reminiscent of my summers in New Orleans in the 70's and with my cousins as we ate on the front porch, literally salivating over what's coming out of the kitchen next.  Take a chance on the Flipside."}
{"text":"Fresh catch is always amazing
Flipside burger is the best burger in town 
The brussels are better than Hickory ...
The warm asparagus salad, wow!
If you live in Fort Mill, you should be eating here regularly. If you live anywhere else it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"We recently had a staycation day and have been wanting to eat at Flipside. The concept is farm to table. They have a list of local farms that they purchase from. When you see that this is in a strip mall, you think, can't be too good. However, the food here is really good. The staff is a little hipster which just adds to the atmosphere. If you want good food, definitely stop here for breakfast to start your day."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmarked list for a while and I finally made it here by accident. My first place for lunch was closed so this was nearby so my coworkers and I came here and I am so glad we did.

This is a small cafe in a small strip mall. You may be waiting a while for a table if you come during peak times. But don't let that discourage you. This place is worth it! 

This place is a farm to fork cafe They list the local farms they deal with on the chalkboard above the counter.

The menu consists of elevated American cuisine.  They have burgers, their take on mac n cheese, fish, salads, shrimp n grits, and so much more.

For lunch I went with the meatloaf mac n cheese which was recommended by our server.  My coworkers both went with the 5 buck chuck burger which was also recommended.

The mac n cheese was amazing and came with a slice of meatloaf on top. Cut a piece off and mix it with the mac n cheese and you're in heaven! My coworkers said the burger was one of the best they've ever tasted.

The staff was great here and very friendly and helpful. I also love decor and all the pictures of trees and tree sculptures. 

I'm already thinking of what to try on my next visit."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. Went for Sunday brunch. I had the lobster omelet and it was more than I could eat. I'm a big guy so that doesn't happen very often. My mom had the Benne Benne which is two Eggs Benedict and she ate it all. That's rare for her. Also ordered a side of the fried potatoes which were delicious. Got there around noon and we didn't have to wait at all. Our server was super nice and everything was very quick. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great brunch!!  I had a lobster omelette.  We were in a rush and they got our orders out very quickly and were extremely nice.  Will definitely go here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food and atmosphere here. I love how their breakfast food is different than traditional breakfast but still offer your classic breakfast favorites. I would give this a 5 star but every time I order the steak and eggs they always make the steak wrong, which isn't the waitress's fault but definitely is annoying having to remake my food and wait for it again. Other than that I really enjoy this place and will continue to come back for the fresh and delicious food."}
{"text":"What a great find right outside Charlotte! I had a great brunch at Flipside Cafe. The restaurant is small but we didn't have a long wait to get a table. The servers were really friendly and helpful in answering questions about the menu.

I had the smoked salmon sandwich and a side of pimento cheese grits. The grits were absolutely fantastic! The pimento cheese had a little heat in it that made the grits spot on. The salmon sandwich was quite large with plenty of smoked salmon on it. It came with deviled egg mayo on the bagel--/ the mayo was phenomenal. The arugula and pickled onion gave it a nice bite!
If I would have realized the portion sizes were so large I would have forgone the grits because I only finished half."}
{"text":"Flipside cafe is a six or seven stars for sure. Not isn't off when I say that but I got to say these people are fast efficient clean polite and all the nice things you wanted to have him people greeting you and serving you. Their names, that is the founders Mash together to make comfort food. And comfort food it is. But it comes with all that fresh fruit that we wanted in a beautiful metal e and my chicken and waffle was the tenders chicken in the nicest waffle and the most beautiful presentation one could ask for. If you're within a hundred miles this is the place to go. Now we came in a little before noon and we were able to sit down right away by the time we left there was 20 people outside the door just hoping they could be next to get on in there. This place is popular and the reason it's popular is cuz it's good good good. If you get a chance this one is worthwhile. And this one should definitely be in the Yelp top 100 for breakfast"}
{"text":"We wanted to check out the hype. $3 Sunday mimosas. We had order chicken and waffles, two orders of the steak and eggs and a side of grits. Potions were small compared to many places we've been to. We asked for medium rare for our steak and came out medium (kinda chewy) but the hot sauce they have made up for it, grits was good and everything else was ok."}
{"text":"Looking for a good breakfast spot where you can go sit down and eat and maybe even have a drink without breaking the bank? Well i recommend trying flip side cafe out. Staff was super friendly,as soon as i sat down to the bar she told me about the blackberry lavender mimosa for only $5 and i was sold! I ordered the flipside cafe breakfast special which was ten bucks, it came with cheese grits,bacon,eggs, and biscuit and gravy. That wasn't your average biscuit and gravy may i add. I will come back and try the cinnamon toast  crunch waffle really soon."}
