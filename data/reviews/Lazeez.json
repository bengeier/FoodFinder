{"text":"Our server was very friendly and helpful with giving us details on menu items. The service was quick and the food was delicious!! The atmosphere isn't anything extraordinary but for the quality of food at this price who cares .. The lazeez salad was super yummy and all of our chicken dishes (gyro, chili chicken and tiki chicken masala) were great too."}
{"text":"Amazing Food, amazing Service. I have visited the restaurant as one of my favorite restaurants of the year. From their Indian to Mediterranean Dishes, I some times wish that I have enough room to order everything in the menu in one sitting. Love the place."}
{"text":"Great food. Shit service. Don't bother ever ordering anything 15 minutes before hand or even an hour because they haven't even started. Make sure you don't have anything nice planned afterwards like let's say a movie because you're not going to make it."}
{"text":"Wow! The food was finger licking good.

I ordered the food through GrubHub as you know how tired it will be after a whole night party!
Food at \"Lazeez\" was absolutely brilliant. All my friends loved the Biryani , we ended up going to Lazeez for the second time next day and also took some food back to LA.
I  recommend Lazeez to anyone who wants to eat good food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"the restaurant is good and clean the food delicious .. i love the the marsala But it is pricey .."}
{"text":"We love this place as you get so much food for your dollar.
I'm there at least 2 times during the week as you end up craving the food or can smell it as soon as you get out of the car and your mouth starts to water.
The beef shawarma is packed with tons of meat and it keeps you full all day !!
You have to have patients when you go at lunch time but the food is worth the wait hands down ! !"}
{"text":"Their Lazeez on the rocks is so good! (much better than Osmow's :p )"}
{"text":"I cannot stay away from the lazeez burger...I've been here 6 times in the last 2 months and I have yet to try other menu items. 
the burger is perfectly seasoned and has mushrooms, bell peppers, cheese, etc. it's easily in my top 3 burgers of all times
the ambiance is great and the staff are courteous and considerate. 
on my next visit I promise I'm going to try something else!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best shawarma you can get in Mississauga. Prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge! Hot sauce is very spicy!"}
{"text":"Staff is awesome, food is okay. I found out that the owner does not give the waiters your electronic tips, so please bring cash!!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken curry and it's really good, just right spice, definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"Really good shawarmas. Owners are really friendly and treat you well. Service is good. Good size portions. I hear that the owner is a former osmo's employee, so similarities in taste."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 0 stars.
Food used to be good, now portions and quality have gone down big time.
Don't bother calling ahead to avoid a 45 minute lineup, they won't start making it until after you pay.
Owner is always yelling at people and scowling. What's his problem??
Had three meals that were sub par qaulity and quantity. Tried phoning to complain,  they don't care. Wrote them an email to express my unhappiness, they  said they'd get back to me but never did.
Last time I was in there I saw the Health Inspector. She said that people had complained that they were getting sick. Restaurant is dirty and grimey. Give your money to a place that actually cares about its customers."}
{"text":"Their Lazeez on the Rocks platter is the LOVE of my life. I just wish they would improve their seating areas and speed of service. Granted, their speed isn't really their fault--the place is just super busy all the time with long lines contributing to wait times."}
{"text":"Honestly I went with my boyfriend as he recently found this place and loved it. Unfortunately my experience wasn't so pleasant. I brought home my chicken souvlaki platter this evening to discover my chicken was bloody. Not only was this completely unappetizing, I am truly hoping I will not get sick from this. Will confidently say that I will not be returning."}
{"text":"A little Lazzzzy on those frozen onion rings they were including in the combo. Coke syrup is overdue for replacement. Passable kabobs, excessively mild chili chicken, large portions of rice, uninspiring salad. Not too far from a place that sells much better kabob and salad combos, I'll probably pass on coming back. The place has got potential but you can tell they're bit too dependent on premade ingredients in the kitchen. Manager was very friendly though and I'm sure kids couldn't tell the difference, so probably worth it for a family  trip using restaurant.com coupons."}
{"text":"Decent shawarma. Long wait at lunch time. Medium spicy is very spicy. I had the chicken and beef shawarma wraps but the hot sauce just overpowered the taste. Other than that - not bad."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with their food. Restaurant is very nice and beautiful but people are paying money for the food. The taste is not good and the menu is very confusing. You can eat better tasting food at home. They should have less items but the quality, quantity and taste should be very good. Since we don't have that many good halal restaurant in Las Vegas. I wish them all the best and i hope their food gets better. \" Read less"}
{"text":"Tried this new restaurant in our area for the 1st time. Atmosphere was nice, clean but broken up a bit from previous tenants (possibly Sushi place).
Not being familiar with their menu it took awhile to work through the descriptions. The food was good overall. They offered 'hotness' from 4-10 depending on your preference for the chicken curry. We asked for 4. We are used to spicy food and didn't think it would be too hot for our taste. When we tasted the dishes it appeared they offered the choice but it came the way it was prepared - too hot, too spicy, more like an 8+. I asked for chutney which they did not offer, nor did they offer yoghurt to cool it down. I got a chili sauce which did nothing to reduce the heat.
Honestly, the prices are a bit high. $12 for spinach is not in line w/what it is. We might try a lunch special another time but wasn't too pleased with this experience & most likely another 'one & done'!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and I would definitely eat here again! I was happy with what I got for the money. The décor is all over the place but has a certain charm, and the staff was very friendly. The way they serve the food is odd. Those red baskets you usually see at burger joints or diners do not suit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Its pretty good place to go have food ,Wanna go there again and have stuff.The counter girl Veronica was Supercute n adorable.She got the stuff fast,was attentive and really sweet!.The manager is also really a nice desi person.On the whole my chicken tikka was Swadisht(hindi word for yummy).Amazing resturaurent for Asians n indians in particular."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great servings and price is very reasonable. I always order On the rocks on rice and or fries. Both are very good. Even chicken sharwarma are very good. My fave place!!! You should try it, if you havent !!! You wont go wrong.."}
{"text":"I was giving this restaurant another chance because my visit was horrible. Now let me explain to you why I will never be going back there again. First, we ordered the vegetable puff pastry. It was obviously reheated as the top and bottom were very burnt and dark, while the filling was cold. Next, we ordered the chili chicken. There was absolutely NO flavor- like literally tasted like nothing- and the chicken had a gooey and extra chewy texture; no one touched the order. The only semi decent thing there was the french fries. Plus, this place is super over priced! Left $40 less and dissapointed."}
{"text":"So me being a teacher and having cultural night at my school, needed some help to cater food. This place really came through for me! They were super helpful and very nice in having my food delivered on time and at a great price. The butter chicken was to die for yummmmy. Definitely recommend this place for indian food. Really had a great experience with their catering service and staff. Try their butter chicken and channa masala. Wish i could give them more stars."}
{"text":"We recently had a dinner party for 20 people catered by Lazeez and it was fabulous.  The food arrived at the scheduled time and was piping hot.  The most important part was that it was delicious and they had really calculated the perfect amount for the group.  All my guests commented that it was delicious too!  Would definitely cater from them again."}
{"text":"Love this place, love the food, love the nice owner (even though he looks grumpy). 

I find the quality of this place to equal osmows. My girlfriend still pledges allegiance to osmows. To me getting the same taste of food, (I think lazeez has better quality- osmows seems to have dropped the ball recently) with less of a waiting time and having the option to eat there without feeling like your in the way- was the reason I was sold on lazeez.

Try lazeez on the rocks, if your tired of shawarma.  Portions are big so if you gonna eat all of it, make sure to plan a nap before going back to work!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very inconsistent. Some days I get the best shawarma I've ever eaten and others just a dried out sandwich. I've had to switch to chicken on the rocks to ensure my hopes are not being dissapointed...rice chicken and sauce... Smaller chance of messing that up. In terms of service sometimes they are very slow and others they are fast. This place can get busy in the evenings around 7-8:30pm. If you are feeling a shawarma- this place will give it to you... Just don't expect to be blown away everytime."}
{"text":"Tried the On the rocks with rice and fries and it was quite good, got a large portion and it was a lot for lunch but since it was my first time a wanted try it with both rice and fries so that's why I got large but regular portion with just rice will be my next choice. Overall very good!"}
{"text":"Brought my 5 year old grandchild. We loved everything. We will be back and order take out. Awesome food service and great vibe. Great for  Vegans and vegetarians"}
{"text":"Love the food but am always disappointed with the service. I one time ordered a shwarma for pick up & still ended up waiting 30 minutes. Made me never want to return again!"}
{"text":"This is our GO-TO shawarma place, the food tastes great, price is good and is very consistent. The people could be nicer, and the wait time is usually 5-10 minutes. But we find the food worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really close to  my house, the wait can get long sometimes but the staff handles it well and it is definitely worth it. I get the chicken shawarma everytime and it is the best! I've tasted other shawarmas from Osmows and other restaurants around the area and this rates the best in sauce, moisture, size, and price! 

At one point when they opened a new location I thought the quality went down for a while but now it's pretty good again! Hope they continue to make the same shawarmas! Very satisfied"}
{"text":"A great spot in Mississauga for some shawarma. I tend to stick to what I love and I love their 'Lazeez on the Rocks'! The chicken is always fresh and they give quite a bit for the price. Just be aware you have to wait a bit to get the good ( most of the time) - thats because I have not seen this place without a line-up."}
{"text":"My Favorite Shawarma restaurant in the GTA !

Every since I discovered their chicken shawarma on crispy fries, I stopped buying fries supreme from taco bell in the same plaza! 

With their Chicken being well Marinated and Flavorful + Garlic sauce + Crispy Fries + Thin Onions slices on top for some Zing, Makes make this Shawarma Poutine-like Mod Taste so AWESOME! 

The Owners are Very Friendly and do their Best to make you FEEL Welcomed!

Also I Love their Aquarium, I purposely sit at the tables facing them so I can Enjoy their Great Food While watching the Colorful Fish swimming about. Excellent Entertainment also while waiting for your order if you happen to be sitting at that side of the restaurant.    

I Feel Happy and Satisfied When I eat here with my Family and Friends!

Definitely a Great Place to Eat when craving Shawarma ! =^_^="}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. I'm not certain what I had as it was the curry of the day lunch special, but i couldn't get enough of it."}
{"text":"The best chana masala I have ever had. Nice and spicy. Good atmosphere.  A combination of fancy and casual dining."}
{"text":"Me and my family always enjoy eating here the food is delicious and yummy. The restaurant is very elegant and clean all around. The staff is very friendly, nice and attentive on giving you a home service. The manager suggested the most delicious food and I can still taste flavors after a few days. They have delicious vegetarian and vegan food, also, they have gluten free options. Try the lamb shawarma wrap with the garlic instead of pita bread and add feta cheese, also, their chicken tikka masala and chicken chili is really good. The mango lassi and chai tea are one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Get ready to wait minimum 30min for an order. Must visit if you have nothing going on in life"}
{"text":"get the special of the day, amazing deals and pretty great quality.  chicken shwarma or falafel wrap are solid options"}
{"text":"I had the Beef Tikka and the Chicken Samosa :) it was Fantastic!!!... So Much Flavor, Great Portions for the Price. The Staff was Lovely, very Excited for their First Day if Buisness. I will Definitely be back for More :)"}
{"text":"Best Indian/desi place in Vegas. Service was good , fahim was really nice and helpful"}
{"text":"I come here often since it's so close to my work. They are really inconsistent. I am writing this review so they can take a note of this and not serve dried out chicken. I don't want to pay 9 dollars for something that I will not enjoy eating. Step your game up, Lazeez. Won't be going until it becomes more consistent. More than half of the times I go there, the chicken is dried out in their own the rocks. The whole meal seems cold. :("}
{"text":"Forget about the indian-was unfamiliar with place but love Indian food-put off by the fact many non_indian dishes on menu-advertised  that new northern Inidian food on menu-cashier-receptionist certainly not Indian-had to refer tp somerhing written to describe food-asked her difference between Northern and Southern Indian food-was lost-brought out  someone who she said was the cook-obviously of Arab not Indian descent although he said he was Indian-couldn't explain much-seemed annoyed-food was not authentic especially the bread which was just hot pita bread-place had horrid ambienmce but we took out-so who cares-best thing about food was size of portions-also quite expensive-they advertise the deliver but cashier was very vague when I asked her about delivery -said they could probably deliver for $5 or $10-when I got home looked at menu-no real Indian food-I guess the regular stuff was selling too well so they decided to pose as an Indian restaurant-to top it all over there is a horrible sewer stench by the door-just what you need to whet your appetite"}
{"text":"Nice small Mediterranean/Indian restaurant. Decor is cute. Out server was really nice. We ordered the appetizer plate which was baba ganoush/hummus and tzatziki sauce. It came with the most amazingly falafel. The pita bread was warm and yummy. They basically make you buy more pita bread though bc it barely comes with any to begin with. For 1.50 more you get a serving double the size of what it comes with. Not a bad price, but the appetizer was already $11. Regardless, we ordered Mediterranean salads with chicken added. By far one of the best I had. The chicken was seasoned perfectly, and was cooked to perfection.  The dressing was a mix of tzatziki and jalapeño, which was spicy but not overwhelmingly spicy (I can handle spice). Overall the food was outstanding.

We took a look at the lunch buffet. We came near the end so everything had been out for awhile and it looked that way. No hummus, pita bread or much of a selection of veggies. We skipped on that but possibly would have tried had we come earlier. There was still a nice selection on different dishes to try nonetheless. 

We will be back for sure:)"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. One of the worst meals I've ever had and I'm usually pretty forgiving. My friend and I came expecting to have Indian food. Apparently they only serve that on weekends (???) so we had questionable Mediterranean food instead. My veggie panini was almost inedible. The chicken and hummus my friend had were just ok. Service was pretty bad too. I understand they just opened and figuring things out and I could see they mean well but still... I was embarrassed that I took my friend here. This place has potential but they need to train the staff and have a complete/revamped menu."}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants in vegas that servers good hala food, loved the chilli chicken here."}
{"text":"I've had the same dish twice now - lazeez on the rocks, extra garlic sauce medium spicy. Both times AMAZING. Once I had it with the yellow rice and most recently with the lentil rice. I def prefer the lentil rice bcuz it has much more flavour. Also nice pieces of onions in it so if u don't like onions get the plain rice. The only thing I don't like about this location is the customer service is hit n miss. Also wait times are worse at certain times of the day. Went today around 1:30pm and was in n out in less than 10 mins. Food reheats very well in the microwave, almost as good as fresh. Great value,  large ass portions for under $10. A poor man's dream, I will def eat here time and time again."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but I guess they came into some financial difficulty because they have reduced the portion sizes substantially.  Probably explains why the restaurant was empty when I went there.  To me it seems like the portions have been reduced by a third.  I got suspicious when they served the food in different containers then they made up some excuse that they ran out of the regular containers. If you are on a diet or looking to reduce your calorie intake I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is way overdue! This is my neighborhood favorite, conveniently located near Easy Life  Boba (for your mouths after party). The food here is always on point! An awesome staff, super friendly, lowkey environment...  The portions are definitely good for the gains and it's always SO delicious.. Promise. Don't forget to try th falooda and mango lassi, so dank.. just do it. Everyone's friendly and the food is awesome.

{"text":"Terrible. Microwaved food.

Since the reviews seemed promising I was very eager to try it. This is my first yelp review and it due to the food at Lazeez, it deserves to be my first post. 

$40 for bland microwaved food. The food was so hot it was not edible for a good while. The chicken tikka had no spice, but was loaded with cream and tomato sauce. I honestly thought I was eating a vodka sauce. I very well could have been eating a microwaved vodka sauce. 

If I wasn't so hungry, I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did, even though I still threw away 3 plates of food(which I feel terrible about).Waste is waste, but save your money. The staff was very nice, but I go to a restaurant to eat, not to make friends."}
{"text":"Ran in and grabbed a to-go order of baba ganoush.  Best I'd ever had.  Sooo good that I went back with the whole family.  Chicken samosas, falafel, hummus all as outstanding as the baba ganoush.  Everything is made to order, beautifully seasoned, and delicious.  Very reasonable, in my opinion."}
{"text":"After seeing countless endless lines ups every time I passed by the place, I decided to give it a try. I mean how different could a chicken on the rocks be? We stopped by on Sunday, mid morn. It wasn't crowded at all. As per reviews I ordered the chicken on rocks. It was delicious...just like at the other shawerma restaurants in the vicinity! Only difference is lazeez gives a heaping portion of rice and chicken sans salad or potatoes. I would go back."}
{"text":"Chicken wraps and falafel wrap are awesome. Went with friends and it was really good.. Price are very good..."}
{"text":"Excellent and very clean food.  Definitely the best Indian food in town.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"They now have a lunch buffet with naan!! All you can eat! I stopped by for my Sunday treat ( been here several times now) and got this additional treat!  Nice buffet in addition to their wonderful menu. So i did the buffet.  Nicely spiced, raita by my side to cool it down. Delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"After my bad experience I decided to give it another shot.  I went there three times after the incident and the manager was very nice to me. 
The place tends to get very packed and busy and maybe the manager was a bit under pressure. 

Im very satisfied with my recent visits."}
{"text":"My go to place for Mediterranean food. The lazeez on the rocks is amaaazing. Reminds me of the chicken on the rocks from the Halal Guys food truck in NY. Ambience is lacking but I usually just take out anyway."}
{"text":"Wow this place is my new favorite! This place serves up lots of flavor, fresh spices and ingredients, I ordered a chicken curry dish to go it had large delicious beautifully cooked tender chunks of chicken breast and fresh veggies I ate it for lunch and then dinner it was that much!  I ordered it a 6 and it was just right. I see that other reviewers commented on the prices and gave them less stars, it takes money and effort to deliver a freshly made quality meal and I appreciate that some people are still out there trying to do just that so I'll pay a tad more for that any day, the entree was so big I ran out of rice (so ask for extra rice for your next meal) one of their entrees can feed two people so long as one of them is not Fat Bastard! By the way this place is spotlessly clean! Keep up the good work- I will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Amazing food at good value. Everything from the shawrama to the dinner plate is fantastic; has to do with their signature sauce. Their rice is full of flavour and very tasty, the shawrama is amazing, it is like having a religioua experience each and every time i eat it. Nothing more to say, this is th best in th west side od the city."}
{"text":"Why are all the best shawarma places in Mississauga? 
The shawarma plate (lazeez on the rocks) is on par with Osmows. The sauce is amazing, and they give a generous amount)"}
{"text":"I did like the place in the beginning and a simple alternative for Osmows, but these guys have worse wait time than Osmows now. Good luck trying to order by phone, when you get there no one knows anything and YES the lady who works there puts 10 grams of meat on a plate. Taking stinginess to another level."}
{"text":"Good eat however the service was a bit slow this evening. Unsure why as i think they ran out of ingredients for my friends sharwma"}

{"text":"This place has a weird vibe.  Only employee seemed to be multitasking.  Food was  very disappointing and menu was confusing.    We won't be back under any circumstances.  Yelp let us down!"}
{"text":"I got take out falafel and fries recently and felt it my civic duty to update my review and rating. The fries were rotten. Well the potatoes they used to make the fries were rotten. They look like regular fries but as soon as I started chewing I knew something was a miss. It was absolutely disgusting. I actually had to spit it out of my mouth. I can't even begin to describe the taste of rotten fries. It was horrible! This must be an actual health code violation. A health inspector should pay a visit here. 
So I must be crazy after that to try the falafel but I did. (It was late and I was hungry). First bite led me to discover the falafel was dry and way too oily. It was as if it had been sitting out for hours and then they just tossed it back into the fryer to soak up some more hot oil. Gross. 
Suffice to say, I was no longer hungry. Just disgusted. I'm never eating here again. Never! Ever!

There is never any excuse to serve rotten food. Never."}
{"text":"We go here a lot, food and decor is excellent. Must try their halwa puri and chicken tikka! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We have only eaten using delivery service during my wife's pregnancy and the food is amazingly consistent and always fresh. Fantastic favorites are Tikki Masala of course and Veggie Samosas. Lamb Gyros and Veggie Burgers are tasty treats as well. Highly recommended and we have never seen the joint!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. I didn't find anything special. Service can be a little disorganize. Place seems clean and it's in a convenient location. Sad part is I don't go here when I'm craving for chicken on rocks or shawarma. I only go here out of the convenience of the location."}
{"text":"I'm middle eastern and I ordered Indian food here and it was interesting. I don't think it was my favorite Indian food I've eaten but it's pretty good! Portions were huge! I read some of the other reviews and am shocked that people were saying that the portions were small. I ordered the biryani chicken rice and the chicken tikka curry. It was a whole lot of food! And it was all pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"Everyone's raving about one thing, and for good reason. LAZEEZ ON THE ROCKS is amazing! Great value for money and delicious as well! I've had the shish taouk once before as well, but it doesn't compare other places that I've had it. Come here for the Lazeez on the Rocks, don't sleep on it.

Sidenote: It can get crazy busy around lunch time, so keep an eye out for that."}
{"text":"What an amazing find. I love Indian food but my family is not a big fan. There were other options for them, so everyone is happy. They custom make your food to your level of spice, I am in love. We had the veggie and chicken samosas, chilli chicken and the hubby had an amazing philly steak with steak fries. Took a menu with me so I can plan my next meal here."}
{"text":"Manager came by as my order was being prepared and asked the person preparing it to remove some meat and place it back in the bin they keep it in."}
{"text":"My curry chickpea dish came boiling hot straight from the microwave, it was tasteless except for the taste of salt, so bad it was uneatable.  Pretty mediocre food all around, no reason to stop here especially when Violet is next door with vegan but actual yummy great tasting food."}

I appreciate the numerous and delicious vegetarian and vegan options.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly.  I look forward to my weekly visits."}
{"text":"The Lazeez special on rocks is only thing you need here, chicken, rice, garlic sauce and hot sauce is ultimate combo, and it's he cheapest thing on the dinner plate menu cause it doesn't come with veggies.  Only downside of this place is the long wait on busy times.  Also there was a really strong bad body odor in the restaurant when I went, those were the only negatives.  If the food wasn't so good I wouldn't even give it five stars"}
{"text":"Great and delicious food - very professional and excellent staff.

I had dinner and lunch here and service and quality was consistent.

Thanks"}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  I read some of the bad reviews and have to say its unfortunate but I understand you can please all the people some of the time, or some of the people all of the time but you cannot please all of the people all of the time.

For me - I am crazy about Aloo Matter.  Lazees has a very unique recipe that is nothing like any Aloo Matter I have ever had.  Even in Delhi where I work on occasion, it is not this good.  Seriously.  The Naan is addictive - beware.  Once you taste it, you are ruined for life, it is that good.  Other Naan will simply not live up to it.  Even though I do not eat much meat, I like the Chicken Tikka Masala (honestly, I only eat the sauce over rice and give the chicken to my daughter).  I would say it is a standard recipe - quite good, but I think its similar at other restaurants (still - that is a good thing).

The only complaint I have is the falafel was simply not good.  It was dry and lacked taste.  Could be they baked it?  I don't know but I have become accustomed to the falafel from the Halal carts in NYC (another addiction of mine) and Lazeez falafel simple does not measure up.

Otherwise, definitely add this restaurant to your must try list."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this location over the weekend. The inside was quite nice, the decor was minimalistic & tasteful. I ordered a chicken gyro & my bf ordered the tandoori chicken. The food was very good, but the service was less than exceptional. We were not offered drinks upon arrival, our waiter just came over and asked us if we were ready to order. He took our order on a tablet, which apparently was an instantaneous system because he seemed very annoyed when I made a change to it. He came back after rushing off to cancel the previous mistake to finish taking the rest of our order. I asked for garlic naan, and he scoffed at the request, I'm assuming because we hadn't ordered a curry dish or anything like that which usually accompanies the naan. Anyway, he told US to remind HIM about the naan when he came back with our food... my boyfriend and I were kind of confused, it was as if he was making it a point that he would forget it? So he brings out the food and leaves.. Moments go by and we realize our naan wasn't coming out anytime soon so we ask another waitress about it. She is very nice and goes to get it right away. Our waiter comes out seemingly irritated and says \"I told you guys to remind me... I have 2-3 other tables...\" and some other stuff I couldn't understand. Literally we were the only people in there besides another couple that had walked in not too long ago. I was in complete awe. Also, the ice in our water was almost completely melted when we got them.. Needless to say we probably won't be coming back. It's a shame because the food was very good and it was a nice location.. 

P.s. Our receipt revealed that this wonderful staff member's name was Faheem. Thanks for your service Faheem, maybe next time try a little patience and kindness?"}
{"text":"Awesome food very fresh and timely served. Chicken Makhani was awesome. I would go back three"}

{"text":"Definitely can tell it's a new place need to work on their service! when I got there no one was ringing anyone up and a girl didn't show up until five minutes later which is weird to leave an entire restaurant alone with no one in the front... The food though was very good and is the only reason I'd come back ..but maybe call ahead and dine out"}
{"text":"The food of Lazeez for me and my family is the perfect fusion of flavors. Best of both east and west. I am devoted halal eating individual, so is my family. So for us finding the right place to have the quaint essential american burger but in a halal form was a challenge since we moved to Vegas. But I have to say that Lazeez's special Lazeez beef burger hit the spot for us. It has all the components of a delicious burger; juicy, moist, meaty and fresh. It also have hints of spices that gives it a eastern flair which is amazing. Their portion size is also very reasonable. The burgers come with steak fries and overall it was very filling. However the price is a little on the expensive side but that is understandable since they are offering halal meat and chicken. We still have not tried their other dishes, but we definitely would be going back for some more.

It's decor is also something I have to write about. It has such an unique up scale diner like feel with Mediterranean touches like light fixtures and etc. It is always clean and the red and white color scheme adds a nice brightness to the restaurant which I think adds to the dining experience. So Overall Lazeez was a great experience.

I  made a yelp account to just write how great this place is and for me it being halal is the most amazing aspect. Thank you from all the halal food seeking individuals out there, you fulfilled our craving. :) keep up the good work and just a suggestion if you could possibly bring more Americans but halal dishes to the menu then it would be great ;)"}
{"text":"We're road tripping from Kansas and drove through Las Vegas and needed food. Place is great. Great service and even better food. Chicken Makhni was delicious and the kids said the burgers were also delicious. The Kabobs were also well cooked and tender. Good portion for everything. Best of all they have a full halal menu. Will have to stop by again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"One of the best shawarma place in GTA. portions are big and prices are really good too. Shawarma wrap, Lazeez on the rocks and Fatoush salad are my personal favourites. This place almost always have long line ups and waiting time for me always have been aprox 20-25 minutes. It's a small shop with limited seating capacity so I always prefer take out."}
{"text":"Shwarmas are great! they get you in and out quick.  Only complaint is that its difficult to enjoy your food if your eating there because they never turn on the heat! So for pick up its great eat in not so much"}
{"text":"Tasty, authentic and healthy food. Food is not greasy at all and almost no visible use of food colors.. Courteous hostess and staff. Ambience is pretty good. 

Will look forward to next visit and recommend to friends visiting this area."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price! Even the regular shawarma is filling. The large one is all I need to be full for a while! Ive had a chicken shawarma as well as a beef shawarma and  both were great! 

Ive also tried the Lazeez on the rocks and thats great as well. 

Overall the place has great food for a great price.

My only complaint would be the wait time. After you order you wait a while for food but since the place is so busy i can over look this."}
{"text":"Great place I used to live 10 min walk away from that plaza. Ordered a chicken shawarma dinner with potatoes and salad. 

For $12 dollars flat man it was worth it and for an extra $2 you can get double chicken. I ordered one for my coworker one day and he couldn't even finish it. I do recommend the lentil rice which is really good but there are nights that they run out of it. I asked for extra hot which I get in most shawarma place that I go to, bad idea lol it was hot and I mean HOT I didn't expect it to be but it was soooo good. They do have specials everyday for a good price as well. Friday is two shawarma plate minus the potatoes for $17 which is a steal. Like other people who reviewed this place MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR EXTRA GARLIC SAUCE."}
{"text":"Excellent Food, Price! Service not the greatest also organization is not very good.
Chicken on the rocks is absolutely delicious!
Friday and Saturday specials are amazing great value!!!"}
{"text":"I'm currently on a mission to try the different chicken on the rock vendors in the Mississauga area. After reading a ton of reviews about Lazeez, I knew this was the next restaurant to try.

First impressions of place: Ample seating, very popular (lots of people in line to order), a bit older seating and decor but overall a clean establishment. We ordered the lazeez on the rocks (spicy) and the shish tawook. 

It took about 15 minutes to receive our food, which I found to be pretty good. Food came out fresh. As for there chicken on the rocks, it was good but definitely not my favorite. Dish was a bit salty, chicken's flavor came from the sauce (would be plain without) and I found a small piece of cut up bone in my dish. Hot sauce was actually hot though and they include plenty of sauce for their dishes.

Shish tawook was kind of the same story. Food was good, but chicken was definitely plain without the white sauce they provided.

Overall, I found Lazeez's to be good but not amazing. It could be my own taste preference, but I think I'll stick to the options available in Streetsville for now."}
{"text":"We came here looking for Mediterranean food but the smell of Indian spices and menu lured us in... and we were so glad we ordered the Indian food! I had Chicken Tandoori and my husband had Aloo Cholay and garlic naan. All great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever.. Now that they are popular they don't give a shit about customers making them wait and throwing food at them like their doing a bloody favour... Can't wait for you to go bankrupt ."}
{"text":"Chicken on the rocks was tasty. Get there 10-15 minutes before Noon to avoid the lunch rush. However even if your stuck in the line traffic, they have a quick and efficient ordering system, which includes a girl asking for your order over the counter while you're in line. Most people nod their heads for chicken on the rocks as she prepares 5 boxes at a time. I was about to get \"spicy\" where my friend urged me to downgrade so I wouldn't throw out my meal. Greatest decision I ever made Lol. The medium was still SPICY! And Im a Korean who has been eating spicy foods my whole life. Overall, great no-frills spot for takeout. Dining seats are a little outdated and (gross)."}
{"text":"Absolutely best Indian food I've ever had. I come here often and they are always very friendly and efficient, whether I dine in or take out. Their veggie korma is my favorite: creamy, flavorful and filling. My partner loves the paneer saag. Even my kids love their food (and they're super picky!) Their veggie samosas are heavenly. Their mango lassi smoothie is to-die-for! I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Seriously this place was amazing from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. 
The decor was very modern with some traditional Indian pieces, it was playful and yet very authentic.
The food was excellent, you must have the Samosas, just the perfect healthy crunchy snack paired with this mint chutney and side of sweet tamarind sauce.
 Lola, our server was very attentive to us in addition to being pleasantly charming.
 
10/10 Would go again,and did mention they deliver!"}
{"text":"If you are a Vegetarian and looking for an Indian buffet, I would recommend this as the last place in Vegas. Definitely the worst Indian buffet I ever had in Vegas. There was no appetizer, no freshly made bread, the salad (if it can be called that) was a joke, just two Veg entrees both of which was pathetic. The Aloo Channa was tasted as if the chef started doing a Sambhar but changed his mind midway and made a mess eventually. As if this much Chickpea wasnt enough, the chat was also Chickpea. The eggplant curry was ok at best.  And over on top of it, this one was called the 'Eid buffet' with no Biryani ! It was also ridiculously priced at $14.99 plus taxes."}
{"text":"One word.... disgusting!    the lazeez on the rocks is simply a couple of scoops of plain rice with unidentifiable pieces of what they call chicken on it, smoothered in an Ok white sauce and topped with hot sauce.  Its so gross..."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today and had a large chicken shawarma, no olives, with medium hot sauce. Service was fast and personable. The restaurant looked clean. And I didn't have to wait too long for my wrap, so that was good. 

Impressions: I wish they had left my wrap in the heat press a bit longer. The pita wasn't as warm as I would have liked, but it was fine. The chicken wasn't as plentiful as other shawarma places and it all seemed to be really dark meat chicken. The garlic sauce wasn't too garlicky and the hot sauce wasn't very hot. I'd probably go with hot if I visit again. 

I'd come back if I were in the area, I just prefer Osmow's garlic sauce and hot sauce more."}
{"text":"I work in the area and we have tried to order multiple times and each time there is an issue. If I call 30 minutes or even 10 minutes before it's never ready when we get there and each time I have to wait 15 minutes to get my order. I have  asked to make sure it's ready for pick up or will be ready within 5 minutes (confirm this about 3 times during the call) and every time I get there they haven't even started getting the order ready.

 I was late coming back to work 3 times at least and the 4th I just walked out because they have no concept of what a pick up order is.

I refuse to go back to this location and my Co-workers all agree thank goodness an Osmos opened near us!"}
{"text":"First time into this business for me and my girlfriend. Our waitress Asmik was wonderful she helped us through the menu she gave us great service the food was very good the atmosphere was very peaceful and we will return."}
{"text":"I was down their for lunch and Wow the place was busy! I loved the owner guy as he wasn't cheap on the sauces. 

There was a quite a bit of line up but that was ok as it was quite busy. I ordered Mixed plate which comes with 3 different types of meats. 

The server was quite good and friendly when taking the order and the Guy making the stuff was nice enough to ask us about the salad choices and other stuff even in a busy time. 

The food was great and for the portion were huge. The Meat was tasty and tender to bit into and the rice was cooked properly. The salad tasted fresh as well. We asked for Hamus on the side and other server started saying it doest come with the meal but the owner was nice enough as said just give it to them. The whole meal costed about $16 and it was quite big and can be eaten by two people.

The place is of a decent size and has quite a bit of seating available.

All in all reasonable priced, huge portions, and good food."}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean Indian Restaurant in Vegas! They just opened a Lunch Buffett too!"}
{"text":"So after reading all the reviews I went to the place
.... before I went I called them(8.30pm) and gave a order for two chicken on the rocks I arrived there and they gave me a number so the fun began... the workers get into a argument because of the ordering display was quite funny.... the service was slowwwww..the lady on the cash counter was whole time busy in her cellphone instead of helping the others ... anyways finally I got my food at (9.20pm) food was ok so atleast one thing was good on the end!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food , I came with 5 other friends . Goat biryani and raita is to die for. Being desi I can tell wat authentic biryani taste like . Chicken samosa and green chutney is awesome . Good service and great food . I would recommend and ch"}
{"text":"Heard rave reviews about the \"Lazeez on the Rocks\" 

Tried it out, definitely delicious -- even the REGULAR is filling

However, they charge extra for saucing it up -- BUT, they did not sauce it up like i've seen. Even my friend who lives down the road has been here since day 1 was kind of surprised that we paid extra for sauce and it wasn't sauced up enough. 

But would try it again! -- #CarbLife"}
{"text":"Another \"go to\" place for shawarma! Good place to eat and close to home! My fiancée and I ordered the special for the day which is two regular sized chicken shawarmas for $10, what a steal!! You can't go wrong!!

We went around 7-7:30, it was already quite busy and a line was forming. But, it didn't take long to order, less than 10 minutes. We knew exactly what we wanted to order so it was quick and the cashier was nice! Even though it was busy, he was still able to give a smile and actually look like he was happy to be there! We decided to eat there and our food was ready in about 10 minutes! It was a fat shawarma!! Completely fresh, toasty, meaty, full of all the toppings, saucy and soooo good!! I got medium and it was actually pretty spicy but just the way I like it!!

I gave it a 4 star rating because the place isn't always clean. I didn't look this time....but the seats in their booths used to be torn up, maybe it's fixed by now, not sure. Sometimes tables are dirty and garbage is overflowing. Today their veggies and prep area was pretty messy. During a previous visit I had to wait foreverrrrrrr for my food to be ready! 

But overall the food is always really good!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Vegas from New York and looking for good Indian restaurants.We decided to try Lazeez.So as we walked in, the place smelled kinda funny and if I talk about  cleanliness it didn't look tidy as we expected and the tables weren't that clean.The bathroom was supposed to be clean but it was stinking and tissues were all around the floor.It seemed likes nobody takes care of that.
Food-We ordered tandoori chicken, it was undercooked, bland and we ordered the beef kababs and chicken tikka masala these two tasted like it was microwaved and half cooked which made  our stomach bad.Service was too slow which the servers  are supposed to be active.I would say it wasn't  worth it eating there.I personally  wouldn't  recommend this place.And at the end when we paid, the lady who served us said to tip her cash because  the credit card tips goes to the owner.So I would say who is trying to eat here, get cash for tips.
We never had this bad experience before."}
{"text":"Food is good but do not order the lunch special if you're hungry as they will give you exactly 4 tiny pieces of chicken  if your order chicken. Place is clean and has an area for small parties."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. Ordered to go, no one picks up phone. You have to order from eat24 which is fine. Ordered on eat24, was given estimated pick up time between 6.50-7.10 pm. While we were on our way to pick up, got a text from them saying now it will be 7.10-7.20 pm. We reached at 7.20 pm, and were told by the very rude lady at the counter that it will be another 20 mins!! Why give an estimated time that is so messed up? She seemed like she didn't care at all. we had to cancel the order and she said \"your wish\" 
Never coming back here.

Updated post - I mentioned in error that I ordered on eater.com, it was actually eat24.com"}
{"text":"Not a lot I right reviews but when it's Mother's Day and my mom tells me that food quality was like a 5 star hotel 
I must say it makes a son day ! 
Matter Paneer, Garlic Nan, Mango Lassi ! 
A must revisit."}
{"text":"This opened up where Safari used to be, so the interior is still fairly new and very clean. The owner worked at Osmow's for a long time, and it seems like he took some of their food with him (no complaints here!). Chicken on the rocks, 'super' sized sandwiches, the hot sauce, and even the chicken shawarmas themselves are very very similar to Osmow's, just in a cleaner, less hectic environment. They didn't simply create an Osmow's clone, however.  They've complimented the 'fast food' menu with Greek dishes, two different rices (the lentil rice is amazing), two different garlic sauces (tzaziki and garlic sauce), very good falafels, a wide array of grilled meats, Greek style potatoes, and 4 different salads. The location is not conducive to generating foot traffic like Osmow's is, but I highly recommend these guys."}
{"text":"John the casher was excellent and very personable and took such wonderful care of us."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. \"Aromatic and addicting\"

We came with a group of 6 people. We came pretty late at night, around 830PM. We typically do not do this to restaurants but we were so hungry!!

The staff was very friendly; she greeted us and seated us immediately; waters came out within my 1-2minute mark. She was very charismatic and personable. We glanced at the menu and it was definitely a great selection. 

The restaurant itself is nicely decorated; it was very clean and bright. The restrooms were also well taken care of. 

We ordered chicken tikka masala, chicken tindoori, rice biryani and nihari. The food came out fairly fast. I was worried that the food would not be as good due it being almost closing time. However, to my surprise everything was delicious.  We ordered 4 things that was enough to share among our group. 

The flavors were both aromatic and addicting. Portions were perfect for our group as well. The tikka masala was creamy and had a flavorful punch. Chicken tandoori we all basically fought for. 

My friends were mainly all from out of town. One is enjoys indian food and is familiar with the spices of the cuisine. He mentioned that this has to be one of the best indian food places he has been to. 

We exchanged friendly conversation with the lady at the end and paid our bill. She didn't rush it at all despite closing time. 

I know that I will be back to Lazeez to continue to try their other entrees. They also have buffet lunches during the week day! Maybe I'll indulge in that as well."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would, just got back from there, and I have never been treated so rudely In my life, yes , old fat dude I'm talking about you! You need to learn respect for ppl ,especially your costumers.  I realize that u are busy, but when one is waiting patiently for 1/2 hour and finally asks where and when there order will be ready, only, to be screamed at and told to go and wait at Tim Hortons, one wonders if he needs counselling or at the very least anger mgmt! I realize you have a stressful job, but most of us do ,and to cuss out a paying customer for inquiring about his order, is simply wrong!!! You are in the wrong business to have an attitude like that, u better recognize who pays ur bills, YOUR CUSTOMERS!!! I will never step foot in ur establishment ever again!!! Learn some respect and don't freak out and cause a scene in front of many ppl! Stay away from this place! Osmows is just down the street!  Your food is at the very best MEH, definitely not worth the wait or the abuse! Thank you, that is all."}
{"text":"The food was okay for me but the service was excellent. It's not that the food wasn't good it was just okay for me but I would definitely recommend it to anyone to try it."}
{"text":"I am a vegan who loves Middle Eastern food and this is one of the best places I tried with plenty of vegan and vegetarian options! Great food and service."}
{"text":"Updating my last review. So once again...I was craving Indian food...and decided to give this place a second chance because it's so close to my house. This time I went inside instead of take-out. The staff was very nice, and the food was much better! Dine in, do not take out. I think this is because if you dine in, you can say something to them. If you take-out, are you really going to drive back down there to say something? No."}
{"text":"Having lived in the middle east for almost 10 years, I've got a prettttttty good idea of what a good shawarma tastes like. I have been on the hunt for an authentic Add to dictionary for many years..to no avail.

I went here based on a recommendation by a friend to try their Lazeez on the Rocks. I also bought a shawarma for my brother. On the rocks is basically a bed of rice layered with chicken, garlic sauce, and hot sauce. Fair warning: they sauce it UP! It was very overwhelming for me and I got a little nauseous after eating it. 

As for the shawarma, the hummus is EXTRA. Hold on.. that's like charging for cheese on a pizza. I got the hummus added on but suffice to say the shawarma was average. It was not bad but was not memorable either.

Overall, my quest for authentic shawarma continues."}
{"text":"UGHHHHHH I. Can't. Friggen Breathe right now. ughhhhhhh. So much food for so cheap, how did this happen.

Meeting up with a friend for lunch today, he was raving about their Lazeez on the rocks which essentially is chicken shawarma on lentil rice doused on garlic sauce, tahini and hot sauce. As I was lining up to order I saw them slathering on the sauce and immediately reconsidered my options thinking that I could find a healthier option.

After some tough decision making I went with the mixed grill which was about $14 plus tax. They warned me that because it's cooked to order and not simply carved off the spit that it would take about 10-15 minutes to prepare. in addition to 3 different meats (shawarma, a kebab and a kafta) the dish came with either fries or potatoes, a choice of 2-3 salads and either lentil rice or regular rice. That's a lot of food!

I went with lentil rice, fatoush salad (my favourite) and potatoes to go along with my meat trio. As promised the majority of my meal took some time but they gave me my fatoush salad right away so I would have something to nosh on while my friend ate his lunch.

Once I had everything I was actually more than a little shocked with how much food there as, nearly two containers worth of food if you include the full sized salad. The rice and potatoes were really good as was the salad but the real star was the meat selection. The shawarma and kebab were very tender, but everything was slathered in sauces so it was hard to judge the taste. The one thing that absolutely floored me was the kofta... WAW!

Imagine if an oval shaped hamburger and a steak had a baby and was cooked to medium rare? Yea that's what I ate... wow. Wow. 

Doubt this place if you want but 140+ reviews cannot lie, Lazeez is bringing you quality middle eastern eats fast, cheap and delicious!

{"text":"Am visitor in Las Vegas last few days and. Have been trying all restaurants, Lazeez was one of the best. Every item we ordered was good, especially the chicken wings. Interior of this place is worth a mention."}
{"text":"Having tasted my share of some authentic middle eastern food over my lifetime, the shawarma here does not even come close to what it should be. 3 stars for the serving size. Place is popular and crowded. The serving size is generous and moderately priced."}
{"text":"First time we came her today, my waitress Lola she is friendly and nice. The food was yummy yummy. I recommend this place 100%. I'll be back, definitely."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find a Indian restaurant in the neighborhood. Went in and was greeted by a sweet girl. I wanted to try the Tandoori chicken so I opted to get it ala cart instead of the meal. (5.00) and ordered a side of Baba Ganoush. She said that it would take about 10 to 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the order was still not ready. I was one of two people in the restaurant. The other person that was their asked about his order as well and she said that we ordered the same thing and it takes a little longer as it is made to order - so I decided to order a chi tea and wait it out. 40 minutes and finally got my order. What a waste of money. The baba ganoush was extremely bitter and chunky. No spice to it at all. The piece had maybe a 2 bites that were edible."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, great service, low prices, big portion sizes. My only constructive feedback is that they do not prepare your food ahead of time so don't bother pre-ordering!"}
{"text":"I found a love of Indian food a few months back and while Lazeez's isn't as polished as some of the other Indian restaurants around town, the food here is by far my favorite. Everything is a little rough around the edges but they always try to accommodate the guests. They use to be more of a self service restaurant (which I preferred and thought worked better with their vibe), but now they are full serviced and have servers. The staff have always been polite and accommodating. I've frequented this place since I discovered it and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The food and service at Lazeez is wonderful!  I have dined in and ordered out and have been pleased with the quality of the dishes.  This place is must try!"}
{"text":"The place was great, the food was fantastic, and Lola was the best. Fast, friendly and made great recommendations!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my family. They have good vegan options. The apps were good. My family was very disappointed with the meat platter they ordered. They said the quality wasn't good. The chicken was good. Our service wasn't good either. They let the waitress know before they didn't like it but she didn't really say anything. I don't like to complain so we paid. My mom said something after because clearly they didn't eat it. They gave them a 5% off coupon for next time. All in all this place is mediocre and there is better options for Indian food."}
{"text":"Surprisingly upscale interior and a relatively traditional menu- apps, wraps, plates, and even Halal desserts round out the menu here, featuring currys and other Indian specialties on weekends. They also have several vegetarian and vegan options.

Interior is very nice- in fact, that walk-up counter is kind of odd (and there are two of them?). Not sure why that layout was chosen over offering table service. Pricing is fair on most items, but some need to come down: $8-10 for a wrap without a side is a little steep considering the fast-casual setup they chose to implement. But they have adjusted their pricing on some items, like doubling the (originally) 2-piece falafel app to 4 pieces for the same $5 price tag. But for $10/wrap, there should be a side.

Falafel is good here- but falafel wrap is dry, highly suggest adding hummus or babaghanouj for moisture and added flavor. Unfortunately the drizzle of tzatziki sauce doesn't quite cut it. 
Veggie samosa was tasty- sided with the red Lazeez's sauce is a surprisingly balanced combo, the fruit-based sauce balances out the heat of the filling. But I don't understand why 1 smallish veggie samosa is $2.50 while an order of 4 chicken samosas is $5.

Tip to management: even if you don't offer table service, do away with the red plastic baskets for serving your meals, they're cheap-looking. Invest in real dishes and silverware. And remove the \"Bus your own tables!\" note above the trash, it's tacky."}
{"text":"I'm not fond of curry & have never had much Indian food but I saw a banner outside their restaurant & thought their lunch buffet would be a great way to try it & it was! It was great! Nice selection including Tandoori chicken, chili chicken, chicken curry (which was mild so I didn't mind the curry), chicken makhani aka butter chicken (which was my fave!), aloo saag which is potatoes & spinach, okra, vegetable samosas (potato & pea filling), rice, lettuce salad, sauces like tzatziki & rice pudding for dessert. They will bring you a huge serving of plain or garlic naan which was delicious! I started with just a spoonful of each item to try it & that pretty much filled me up. I did go back for extra makhani sauce to scoop up with my naan (which I wasn't about to waste!) & a second little bowl of rice pudding (w/pistachio bits on top) which I was skeptical of at first but it totally grew on me! The only thing I missed was hummus but they probably mix the menu up on different days. If I was headed home I would have ordered an order for later. I bet it's good! Place was nicely decorated, clean & the service was wonderful. I was by myself & didn't feel awkward or anything. There was at least one other solo diner & about half of the customers looked of Indian decent so that's probably a good sign as well. I'm happy I've broadened my tastes!"}
{"text":"Brief Overview:
This is a simple Mediterranean and Indian restaurant that provides a good variety of menu options at a reasonable price.

Pros:
- I like the simple yet stylish decor of the interior
-The owner and staff are very friendly
- The food has good flavor and I love their vegan and vegetarian options
- They have a nice private room for hosting parties and entertaining guests

Cons:
- They use styrofoam and plastic utensils for their food. I know this is cheaper for them (and maybe for customers), but I would like ceramic bowls and silverwear to be used from an environmental impact and home feel standpoint.

Final Verdict:
Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice environment and good Indian and Mediterranean food. I've been here countless times for the classes that I teach and recommend them if you are on the fence."}

Definitely going to be one of my regular spot for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Just ok Indian food. This is a half Indian/half Med place so you shouldnt expect much. Got the samosas, chicken tikka masala, and chili paneer. Chicken samosas were tasty especially with the sweet red sauce, they reminded me a little of chicken nuggets. Chicken tikka was disappointing. The chicken was cooked perfectly, but the actual sauce was nothing special. Paneer was cut in really tiny cubes and had more sauce than actual cheese. Overall a bit expensive for being average Indian food, but they give pretty decent sized portions. Entrees also came with free rice. The inside is decorated really nice and the cashier was friendly. Probably wont be back as theres so many other Indian places in town."}

{"text":"Alight folks this single stars goes to Lazeez for their lack of customer service, and not knowing how to operate a business, very unprofessional and incompetent staff.

I called in an order, it was just a single Shawarma, I waited 45 minute at the restaurant, on top of 20 min prior to showing up, they never punched in my order, I arrived, stood in line for 35 minutes to pay, all the people in front me placed their orders, my order was then placed when I paid at the cash, so entire process took 45 minutes.
 
When I asked guy who seemed to in-charge, he stated, \"this how we do it, all fresh\" I said yeah OK, but why would you take a phone order? He stated\" I don't know\" so was I like you are saying although I placed an order over the phone, and you took the order, but you wont prepare till I pay? The owner heard the whole thing; she came up to me asked what I had ordered? I told her, and then repeated again all the topping, she made it right away and handed me the shawarma

And once I took it home, there was a chicken bone in the Shawarma, again!  But the Shawarma was good, so it's very unfortunate but I am done with them, they are very busy and people seem to love their food, minus the bones in the wraps, it's not for me, I wasted over an hour to get one Shawarma with a chicken bone
There are way too many Shawarma places all over GTA for me to go back 

Note to the Owner please train your staff, and thank you for recognizing the error and correcting it.

PS. They also said they don't have cucumber over the phone, but I saw cucumber when I was there, I was told it's 50c, like Whoa! First of all, you said you guys don't have it, and now you are going to charge 50c for cucumber? Really? First Shawarma place I have ever been to who charges 50c for cucumber, not cheese or not anything fancy, but cucumber...

{"text":"Worst service with old lady and Asian girl. Sat here for almost 10 mins without saying a word to me and my father. People look upset with the terrible service with only 3 tables taken. Will never ever go here again. 
Friday 2nd feb. 6.50pm is when I walked out"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try out this place for a day date. I have never tried Indian food before, but I like trying new things and being adventurous so off we went to Lazeez. It's right across from desert breeze park off Durango. At first glance , the restaurant was very clean and decorated super cute. They have a buffet and literally everything we tried was spectacular:) the food was extremely fresh and kept warm with these pretty silver catering dishes I've really only seen at weddings and the Wynn Buffet. Anyway, go stop in you will be happy you did !!!"}
{"text":"Good Pakistani food specially behari kebab, I am so glad I finally found this restaurant. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"Yum!!
Chose to eat here based on great Yelp reviews!  We weren't disappointed. VERY busy at 845pm on a Saturday!
Food took 20 minutes (Lazeez on the Rocks and Chicken Shawarma Platter)
Tasty, saucy and medium heat was perfectly spicy. Eating area a bit worn out but just a sign of a LOT of traffic. People who work there SUPER nice. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try a new place, had some pretty great review, but I ordered a chicken tikki Marsala and asked for a 10 on spicy, had no spice at all, my wife can eat and spicy food and could eat this! The food was good but I wanted spicy! They were closed so I couldn't get a refund or a new order!"}
{"text":"A best place to stop by to have an authentic indian food. A memorable dining experience. 

The service was exemplary. Thanks to the kind young lady and the young boy (hamza) who did a great job.
It was truly an epicureans delight."}
{"text":"Two days in a row I have tried ordering from Lazeez around 3 pm. Yesterday I called about 5 times in a 20 minute span and no one answered the phone in that time period. Today someone actually answered right away, but asked me to hold for one moment and I said sure. I've been on hold for 14 minutes as of writing this Yelp review.

Food is pretty good but the portions are getting smaller since I started eating here, and if you can't even place a timely order (I often order/pick up on my way into work, which is near Lazeez), then what's the point?

Update: Service has gotten better since writing the original review"}
{"text":"This place is new and right down the street so I thought I would give it a try. Their menu is huge and it took me forever to decide because everything sounded so good lol. I ended up getting the chicken biryani. It was so damn good!! It has so many Mediterranean flavors and has such a strong aroma because of it. It might be too spicy for some, but I really enjoyed the spice level on it. It also comes with a yogurt sauce for that reason but I cannot have dairy. It was still a delicious dish without it. It was a bit pricy but definitely worth it. The portions are a good size and the food is authentic. I can't wait to try out more dishes from here!"}
{"text":"This thus far is my favorite Indian/Mediterranean restaurant. Let me start off by saying our waitress was the sweetest person and very helpful in ordering.... thank you! Now let's get to the food... so many options for people who love meat, to the vegetarians and then the vegans. I opted for the beef & chicken kabob plate... which was absolutely delicious! My daughter had her vegan plate... a rice dish with veggies and a chick pea dish which was also delicious... I had to take a bite. My grand daughter had chicken fingers and fries... yes they have a children's section on the menu. I promise you that you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Me and my home girl decided to check this place out since we havent seen each other since high school.... the food was great and i got the mango lasees which I always have to have.... when our food came I wasn't expecting it to be alot so of course too it home ..

Later after we ate... we sat outside at their patio tables outside the resturant because it was a beautiful day.... then the owner came to greet us and informed us about some feature dishes.... (oh FYI  try there red house sauce... its bomb!) .... me and my friend kept chatting away and she let us try their chai tea.... which love chai tea not that bootleg kind from starbucks.... definitely will come back and try the other dishes..."}
{"text":"First time here. I got matar paneer spicy level 8 and it's great! The portions are perfect. The naan is very large compared so other places, I probably should've only ordered one. Looking forward to coming back and trying veggie korma!"}
{"text":"Always come to this resturant when we come to vegas,  have the birhari kabob whenever we come, everything we try is good, our waiter faheem was great."}
{"text":"Me and my wife tried their chicken shawarmas few times and all the time we had to wait 25 mins in that filthy place. They use chicken thigh meat which has a lot of fat in it. Therefore we always got fat in our shawarmas which is grose and unhealthy. I will never go back to this place. The owner is very rude and greedy. He shouldn't put fat in shawarmas."}
{"text":"The food is good but the actual restaurant comes across so dirty. it is always busy & the prices are good. it's honestly identical to osmows"}
{"text":"Not bad for Indian food via delivery. Just a bit more bland than I typically look for in my Indian food. You can order spicier versions of most dishes, but that makes the food hotter, rather than more flavorful as one typically sees with Indian/Himalayan/Nepalese cuisine. Simple, straightforward, and serviceable. The naan here is, without a doubt, the best part of the meal. Have not tried Mediterranean leaning offerings and I have only ordered delivery, so experiences may vary."}
{"text":"Their other location on eglinton and tenth line is superior in quality, portions and service. However, this place is much better than most of the quick service Lebanese/shawarma places. Their portions are substantial!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place! I was stuffed but didn't want to stop eating because the food was so good!! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for an authentic shawarma place.. being Egyptian and having travelled the Middle East quite extensively.. I have a good idea on what an authentic shawarma wrap/platter tastes like.. this unfortunately did not come close.. 
the meat and chicken quality is really poor, came across some bones while eating the mixed lazeez on the rocks.. there were ginormous pieces of meat and chicken and others were just tiny, this isn't the way authrentic shawerma is cut.. the sauce they put neither tastes like garlic nor tahini.. has been to westernized that it is far from what is originally is intended to be.. I wasn't happy eating it and barely made it halfway through my plate.. I do not recommend his place!"}

{"text":"worst Chicken shawarma I've ever tasted, it taste nothing like authentic shawarma! 
First of all,It's bland you cannot taste the seasoning.
They use only dark meat which is neither healthy nor tasteful.
And they put some kind of weird tartar sauce that makes everything taste worst. 
Not to mention the slow and very rude staff!!
I would never go there again."}
{"text":"Lunch special was really cheap and good, the dessert was too. The waitress is always by herself on a weekday and it was never an issue. I have only had the gulab jamun and the beef kabobs, those have both been my only meals. I always go here while I get my dog groomed next door."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! I've had the Chicken Tikka, Chicken Shawarma and the Gyro. Everything was flavorful! Pricing to great and portions are large. 

The layout of the place is a little funky."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and usually the food and service is great. The other night i stopped in with my husband and a friend.  I ordered a goat curry dish which was rather pricey but was hopeful it would be just as great as everything else.  I got my dish and noticed small bone fragments.  I kept pulling the sharp pieces from my curry and asked the waiter if this is how it should be.  He was unsure because it was his first day. Another member of the waitstaff checked with the chef and confirmed it should have bones in it. I asked for a replacement because there were just way too many for my comfort/saftey and showed the many many pieces to the waitress. As if someone took a hammer and whacked the bone.  The experienced waitress told me that they would not replace my dish because I already touched it with my fingers.  She said I was the first person to complain and that is how all their curries come. I have eaten curry there and many other places and never experienced this once. When asked she couldn't even tell me how i was supposed to eat this dish safely.  She returned from the kitchen and advised that they would replace the dish this time. I have never been made to feel as if I was the absurd person until last night.  My meal replaced with a chicken curry and surprise NO BONES . I say surprise because they had just finished telling me that ALL their curries have bones. I was charged for the goat curry that i did not get to eat even though my replacement was 2.00 cheaper. I was done arguing and just wanted to hurry out of there.  I paid the tab with tip turning it into a bill over 82.00 because the new waiter didnt deserve to be jipped. This experience will keep me from frequenting the establishment."}
{"text":"Ate at Lazeez's new All You Can Eat Indian buffet today... Best Tandori Chicken I've had in Vegas.  I've eaten Indian food from Auckland, New Zealand  to Branson, Missouri.  The choices were limited but believe me there was plenty for a quick lunch and it was fresh and very good. No crowd,  good service and priced just right. I'll tell you no dried out Tandori Chicken no cold or lukewarm food.  Lazeez changes the buffet daily so you won't be getting today's left overs tomorrow."}
{"text":"I love my shawarma, so naturally I had to make it here eventually. As others have said, it gets very busy here. The line had a good 20 people waiting. I feel that their kitchen and serving layout is slowing things down a bit, but everyone there was working hard.

I lot of people recommended 'on the rocks', so I thought I'd give that a try. I didn't know much about it and didn't realize it didn't come with any veggies - I may go for the regular platter next time, but they did throw it on when I asked.

Anyway, my plate was chicken shawarma on a bed of lentil rice with various sauces. Everything is very tasty. To be honest, there's a number of seasonings in true Mediterranean Middle Eastern food that I don't know the name of, but they're very tasty. I find the average or poor places are missing out on them. The chicken was full of flavour and the lentil rice had these nice crispy fried onions in it. Sauces were nice, and the hot sauce is delicious - it's one of the thicker, deep red hot sauces which also have a lot of flavour alongside the heat.

Great value here too, barely anything over $11. Close to a '5', but they should find a quicker way to expedite food to improve on service. Perhaps they could renovate and make it more of a takeout spot, since it seems to be the present demand anyways. It would free up some kitchen/prep space. Still, I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We didn't feel like going out to grab some grub in the 108 degree heat, so my boyfriend and I ordered food here delivered to our hotel on the strip. We got the beef briyani, chicken tikka masala, veggie samosas, and naan bread. The food was okay - not on par with food from other places with tried before, but we really liked the veggie samosas.. They were big, filled with veggies, and crispy! They were so good with the green and red sauces they come with.

For delivery it was an extra $10 charge and took about an hour, which we didn't mind because we were THAT lazy in the heat. It was good to have the option, especially to come to a busy area of the strip!"}
{"text":"After my most recent visit, I'd have to say that this place only deserves a 3. Fairly passable, but not much better than that. As I mentioned in my original review, I don't know why they take so much chicken off the spit and pile it on the flat top grill - and I mean literally piled on. It takes away from the freshness and very little of the chicken has that nice crispiness you'd hope for from shawarma style.

It does have redeeming qualities, and I love that they have lentil rice, but they should find better ways of fresh preparation - especially at non-peak times."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because I am vegan. While they do have a decent selection of vegan dishes, the ones I tried were horrible. I ordered the vegetable curry and some whole wheat nan. The food was tasteless. The peas, carrots, and corn were frozen. When the hostess brought the food she only brought the curry, and I had to ask for rice, also she brought the food in a metal container and not on a plate. It tasted like there was no spices or curry added. The restaurant was empty and the cashier kept going in the back, so it seemed like a ghost town. I had to ask and get my own water. The whole layout is horrible. I don't know who designed the place but it actually makes your eyes hurt. I really don't think they will be around very long."}
{"text":"Really tasty food reasonable price . Service sometimes a little slow they have stepped out their game by hiring more employees, But one complain is they need to start accepting take outs  especially when you are coming on your break or lunch for a pick up this is not the ideal place to do that cause depending on their service level sometimes it takes an hour for you to get your food. They need to start making it right away when someone orders over the phone rather than making it when they arrive and pay for it .Defeats the whole purpose of take outs. Nevertheless really good joint in sauga for shawerma . Replaced osmows in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food was good, I loved the rice but I absolutely hate that I order a plate of rice and chicken and was basically charged for having the chicken taken off the kabob. Chicken kabob with rice is about 9$ and I paid 14$ for having the same meal without the chicken being on a stick!"}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend this place for the homely food served.
We loved the dal, okra and chicken curry the most. The goat curry had a nice light flavor to it.
Value for money.
Just comfort food without a doubt!!!"}
{"text":"Its my second time here , and i have been here for two consecutive days. I really like the atmosphere as its so comforting, the service it real quick and friendly. The biriyanis are a must try here and i am returning !"}
{"text":"I first walked in and was surprised that this is a self-serve place. I guess I just assumed an Indian Food place would include service. It makes more sense when you get to the menu/ordering area and see half of the menu is comprised of different kinds of burgers. I didn't discount them just for the fusion menu,  but it was my first point of concern. I was looking for some Korma specifically and they don't have that. So, as the pictures I'm gonna upload will show, I got the lamb Shawarma,  chicken samosa,  a mango lassi. My boyfriend got chicken boti, a drink and fries. 

Our bill came out to $37 for me and my boyfriend which I think is ridiculous for a self-serve indian/American fusion diner (basically). They call your number and you go to pick up your food.  After you eat you throw away your trash and put your plates away. I don't mind going to self-serve places but the amount you pay for Indian food I think it's silly not to serve us. Especially because the place isn't busy! Why are there signs everywhere trying to get customers to serve themselves and clean up after themselves when it takes 30 seconds for an empty restaurant staff member to walk it over. I'll say right here if this restaurant doesn't succeed it's at least 50% because of their idea to make it self-serve. 

I was happy with my lamb Shawarma. The
 samosa was really spicy,  would not recommend. The lasse did not have the bubbly texture I'm used to. My boyfriend was pretty upset with his boti - only because for 11 dollars at a place you serve yourself he thought the portions were too small. He had like five chunks of chicken and bunch of rice and lettuce. They call it a salad but it really is just lettuce. 

However, the lamb was good and I may be back for a lamb gyro if I'm in the mood one day. The food isn't bad just some execution issues I think. If you serve restaurant priced food, serve your customers. Especially if your portion sizes aren't commendable."}
{"text":"Come here often. I usually get lazeez on the rocks. love the chicken and the portion sizes are huge. Only bad thing about this place is the wait times, it can get really busy. The sauces are good but not amazing"}
{"text":"I'm not sure who gave this place 4 or 5 stars. The service is terrible. The drinks are watered down. The curry was too salty. The tandoori chicken was good, yet not enough. Mostly rice. The salad with tzaziki has No flavor whatsoever. The salt shaker had 1 whole so you couldn't get any salt out. The owners must be cheep! Never going back! Save your money!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. One of the best chili chicken I have ever eaten! Our favorite spot to eat every time we come to Vegas!  A must try!"}
{"text":"The best bang for your buck is the Lazeez (chicken) on the rocks. The regular size comes up to about $7 after tax. It's shredded chicken shawarma meat on a bed of rice (choice of plain rice or rice with lentils). Then it gets smothered in a rich and creamy garlic sauce. They will ask what level of spice you want. I usually get medium and oh man it should not to be underestimated.

Pro tip: You can ask for half rice and half salad, or half rice and half fries. I believe it's 50 cents extra but you end up with a platter type of dish at $7.50 for a regular size.

If you come during prime dinner hours, expect to wait around 30 minutes. Line ups would go from the back of the restaurant to the front doors to just place an order. On top of that, there is usually a sizeable crowd waiting for their ordered food. 

But there's a reason why so many people are willing to wait. Lazeez has great, flavourful food in big portions at an awesome price."}
{"text":"Worst shawarma, worst service. Will never go back. Spent a lot of money there and got treated like garbage. Thanks lazeez for the worst experience I've encountered at any restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean restraunt I have ever been to! I got the chicken shawarma, fries, gyro, and the lox and all was amazing especially their dipping sauce. The only bad thing I'd have to say about this restaurant is they are really busy but still manage to get the job done. Today they have earned themselves a life long customer."}
{"text":"I'm not middle eastern but I believe shawarma should taste good on its own. Sauce should only enhance the taste, not be the only source of taste. I've tried their chicken shawarma plate and the chicken shawarma on the rocks. The meat itself is pretty bland without the sauces. I think this defeats the whole purpose of grilling it on a spit with spices. You might as well have boiled chicken slices and add the sauces. 

That said, this place does give you good value. A regular lazeez on the rocks will fill up even the biggest eaters and I can't fathom anyone eating a large version on their own. Amazingly it's only $6.99 for regular and $8.99 for a large. That's great value.

Would I come back? Yes. No other shawarma options in the area and it's good value."}
{"text":"The food and service is not just amazing is outstanding. 
Thanks to all team of this restaurant for making our trip home less tiring. Coming from Utah and heading to California you have to stop at Lazeez restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yummyummyum! I had to come to this side of town because of a problem with Vons.  I hadn't had lunch, so I thought I'd try this place, I actually haven't had Indian food since I moved here 6 months ago. Talk about a silver lining to my 2week headache with Vons. The service was great, genuinely nice people! The restaurant was nice. They even had a separate room for people with kids. I think that's nice, the parents didn't have to correct their kids for running around, there was space for them to move from one side to the other without bumping into neighboring tables. And they could be a little louder. Nice for them and for me. But I'm stuffed. I should have stopped eating sooner but the food was so good, and met a longtime craving. I had butter chicken with garlic naan. It was great. So tasty. Plus I found out they deliver up to 11 miles. I already checked, and I live 9 miles away, so that's awesome for me! I spied on other people's plates and it all looked tempting, plus the other customers were also raving about their meals.  One customer came for pick up anf said yhey come from East LV just for this place!"}
{"text":"Very very rude staff. Was told off for asking for cups. First and last time I will ever visit this establishment."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago and had a wonderful experience at Lazeez. Met the owner Mona and she was was very sweet and attentive. You could tell she really cared for the customers experience and you could taste it in the food as well. Every dish we had was wonderful and perfectly cooked and spiced. A very cool fusion of Middle Eastern/Indian/Pakistani food. The decor and ambience was well thought out and nothing comes across garish. Definitely a place you would go to again and again. We are here a few more days and will surely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here and a delicious falooda drink, goat/lamb biryani, and chicken samosas. My server Lola was fantastic, as I'm new to this restaurant she helped me choose the right meal, can't thank her enough. I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"They make it a self serve fast food restaurant. But it takes 15minutes to make my order and I'm the only one in the restaurant. But the girl working the front is very nice and attentive   
The food? I'm writing this review as I wait for my food that's how bored I am. But I will re write this post after I eat :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Ordered for take out on a Friday night, it was fast, delicious, and friendly staff. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I've always raved to my peers and friends about how great Lazeez is. Today I was craving their 'Lazeez on the Rocks' and normally, whenever I come here there is never a problem. Now let you tell me what happened, and honestly I was in disbelieve when this occurred too.

I was eyeing my order intensely (because I was very hungry and literally drove an hour just to come here), watching it get assembled through the visible glass screen and then it came to my attention that my take out container was not completely covered with rice. When I say covered, I mean an evenly layered portion of rice. You could clearly see that the edges around the take-out box was slanted and was not even like the top portion. When the lady was about to put the chicken in, the co-worker beside her asked why it wasn't completed covered (could hear the entire conversation), and she said that there was no more rice. Two seconds later, a man comes and fills the pot with fresh new rice. She finishes my order and then just smiles at me while handing it to me. She CLEARLY knew and I didn't want to be one of THOSE people so I just smiled and left. It was really disappointing seeing that because I expected better service. I will be taking my money to somewhere else, perhaps even Osmows."}
{"text":"You know you're at a great authentic restaurant when all the locals of that culture come there to eat. Ordered the butter chicken curry with garlic nan as well as a chicken and beef kabob that comes with salad and jasmine rice. From the seasoning to the consistency and flavor..Absolutely delicious! Had to dock a star because we waited almost an hour for our food and there was only 2 of us while people that came after us somehow got their food first. Nonetheless, if you love Mediterranean/Indian food and are in the Las Vegas area.. this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Had lunch this afternoon, wonderful food,delicious and very nice presentation.
The service was excellent!
Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is some good good. Visiting Vegas for the weekend but my man this was some solid stuff. Got the chicken tikka masala with that garlic naan and I was impressed. Decent price and great service too. Would be my local spot if I had this."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice here and the service was great!  I ordered the tandori chicken and the vegetable samosa.  The food is very fresh and the meal was good, but not great.  It needs more flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Out waitress was very friendly as well. The restaurant was pretty packed & our food came out very quickly. I highly recommend their hummus, samosas, garlic naan & chicken tikki masala. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is right around the corner from my office, making this place my go-to when I get my lunch.  My order is always the Chicken Saag- which I could eat almost everyday because it's so good and reasonably priced.  The chicken is always so tender and spiced just right.  The staff is extremely friendly, accommodating and will greet you with a smile.  I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Lazeez as the closest thing I could get to Osmow's before it went downhill so my friends and I made the trip here one day after the gym.

I got lazeez on the rocks with 1/2 rice, 1/2 fries and they got mixed platters. I really enjoyed my food and was not disappointed with their sauce. Also tried some of my bf's greek salad which was good, but they could've went easy on the olives.

We came in at a good time so we didn't have to wait and service was fast and friendly, but within minutes there was a long line up.

Overall I like the food so I will come back if I'm in the area or if I'm craving their saucy goodness but I have to give 3 stars based on the condition of their store. Ripped booth seats, freezing temperature due to an open door somewhere in the back - not very pleasant to eat there at all. With all the traffic they get I'm sure they can afford to fix up the place to a decent standard."}
{"text":"Everyone at work keeps raving about this place because they have the best sauces I was told. Had to try it out! If you are going for lunch, pack patience because this place has a line up ! Although we got there at 12:30 which I guess is prime lunch time. 

About 8 people in front of me. Half way to the cashier they took my order: I got half rice/fries with chicken. Generous portion but I found the rice dry and undercooked and the peas hard. The fries were soggy and oily. The chicken was tuff and dry too. 

I don't think I'd ever go back! I think osmow sells better tasting rice and fries but 4* because the sauce they use is very well seasoned and tastes better than what osmow uses. If you do go here, get the schwarma wrap. Don't bother with the rice dishes! I can see how the staple wrap would be good with the sauce.


**edit** Someone ordered me a kebab and I will say it is pretty good. Got a regular chicken kebab. Made to order. Mild sauce was not overkill in spices. Much better experience"}
{"text":"Very slow and bad service and very expensive. Way too expensive. We ordered burgers and they were small little sliders for about $9."}
{"text":"we started off with appetizer the friiters with chick peas.delicious! got alot of for the money. I had the swarma lamb plate.boy was it good. my wife ordered the chili chicken.she liked it but it kept her up the entire night[very rich and spicy} so for her she won't order again.place was nice and clean inside.had a great waitress. prices were very resonable $11.99 and $12.99.we will be going back.my wife will order something with out tomatoes in it. we told our daughter to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Excellent, flavorful rice and spicy dishes. People complain about the cheap disposable plates but the food is easily able to overcome the presentation. Quite nice! Staff is great and nice decor."}
{"text":"Terrible service...girls too busy gossiping to get your order correct. Don't care to advise that ingredients are not available and just serve you something else without asking."}
{"text":"Good spot, we had the mutter panner, and chicken masala to go, they were both excellent! By the food alone I'm giving this place 5 stars! We didn't eat in, but it looked nice inside. We will be returning."}
{"text":"So good! My food was delicious. Menu states clearly if the dish is vegan, vegetarian, or gluten free. The staff was so friendly. Clean. Modern decorations. Fabulous experience."}
{"text":"Poor customer service....food is alright..dont bother ordering ahead as they only start preparing once you pay up."}
{"text":"let me start by saying im a regular and enjoy the food there and don't mind waiting. I get it they can be rammed at peak times,  i work in a service industry as well. I call in my order and wait till i notice my number hasn't been called and walks after me are leaving before me. So i asked the only asian guy working there were my order is he grabs a bag that someone else didn't pickup and give me a cold soggy Shawarma that threw out. NO APOLOGIES given just handed me my food and left. I enjoyed this place despite the lack of cleanliness and run down look but this was the final straw. If u don't value my continued business i will take it elsewhere. I WOULD HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND THIS DUMP !!!"}
{"text":"Lazeez on the Rocks is to die for! Comes with chicken, choice of fries or rice. $6.20 plus tax with a generous portion. Loved the rice! Chicken was flavourful with lots of garlic and hot sauce. Fresh, made to order. Will definitely be back again to try other items."}
{"text":"i think this place is way too much over hyped because of Osmow's cheat copy cat. don't get me wrong their chicken and rice is good. but not as good as Osmow's. the owner of Lazeez was a worker at Osmow's, had a fight with the owner at Osmow's and opened his own restaurant with all 100% same menu. he has become so big that he just opened another location in Mississauga at Britannia and Tenth Line (pizza pizza plaza)."}
{"text":"Service is fast. Great food I love their chicken on the rocks it's amazing! Definitely worth it for the portion you get!"}
{"text":"great place... contemporary inside setting make you feel comfortable. Tried Faluda drink is amazing and the Lamb shawarma is amazing. Biriani is really plain compare to indian restaurant average biryani. they have to come up with some solution for that. Samosa is great and tried the salad didn't impress me at all.. will try again...."}
{"text":"so tasty; great topping choices; and very heavy with meat- limited seating facility, price is very reasonable. better than the \"more busy pita shops\" will be returning always"}
{"text":"Extraordinary flavors!

A wide variety of foods and spice levels were perfect. 

Best Indian in Las Vegas and not overpriced!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place again and it has gotten a lot better.  Service is super quick and efficient.  Called in my order and they prepared it as soon as I got there.  Ordered Lazeez on the rocks, large with both rice and fries.  They give a lot of rice and fries, with chicken schwarma on top covered with hot sauce and garlic sauce.  The sauce is overwhelming to the chicken, but it did provide flavour to the rice and fries.  The server again warned me not to get the hot sauce, but the lady already put the hot sauce in.  I ate the hot sauce and it's not that hot, especially with all the garlic sauce on top.  The cost of the large lazeez on the rocks with fries and rice (extra 50 cents) was $9.57, HST included.  It's a lot of food so it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I just happened to notice this place on my way to Violette's Vegan so I decided to give something new a try.  I entered at 8:40 pm and was told they close at 8:45 despite the displayed hours stating 9.  Went back to Violette's and just got my food."}
{"text":"Many have said to me its good. The day I went, I had possibly the worst chicken, rice, and sauce combo. Vowed to never walk into that place again. If a restaurant cannot produce the same quality day to day, it does not have my vote."}
{"text":"Tried the Lazeez in the rocks and it changed my life. My only issue with the place is it is absolutely slow as hell. They need to figure out how to improve their operations to speed things up, if you go at a busyish time, expect to wait almost an hour for takeout."}
{"text":"My coworker and I discovered this place a few months ago and have been back multiple times since. We always get the Lamb Gyro lunch special and its delclious. I'm always satisfied."}
{"text":"Complete joke. The owners should be ashamed and embarrassed. The service is terrible and I had to wait about 2 minutes before I was acknowledged at the door even though the place was mostly empty. I over heard the employees complaining \"why does everyone have to come at the same time?\" As if they are used to lounging around collecting pay without work. I also want to point out that I've been waiting for about 20 minutes and they managed to bring out my naan and rice, but no chicken Tikka. I asked one of the wait staff why would they bring my rice before the chicken and she told me her collègue gave my order to another table so they have to remake everything. So now I'm sitting here with cold naan and cold rice. Still  no main course. Nice right? Will never come here again."}
{"text":"First time order catering for office lunch for a party of 20 people - people in our office loves it! 

Lazeez did an amazing job because it's difficult to get a decent caterer with an office's budget limit. 

Lazeez made it happened and they had done a great job at the food choices. The food was awesomely delicious - especially Biryani with Raita and Chicken Curry. Also, the food portion is good and the price is reasonable. The delivery was made on time, which is very important to us. 

The staff was friendly and helpful when I was placing an order. 

We are thinking to order from Lazeez this upcoming week and we will definitely come back again and again in the future. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes authentic Indian food!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout, and everything was exactly as we specified. We tried three of the vegetable curries, and they were as good as some of the more upscale Indian places we've tried. Samosa and garlic naan were also excellent. Very pleased to have them on the West side of town and with delivery through Bite Squad!"}
{"text":"As an FYI, you are not allowed to have the salad in a separate container when ordering one of the specials... You're veggies will be nice and soggy by the time you get home"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant again after a couple of months. This time the food was excellent! Server was polite, attentive n professional. We will be back again."}
{"text":"wish I could give this place 6 stars!! My friends and I love Lazeez, fast service, helpful employees, and the food is amazing with a HUGE variety."}
{"text":"I've been going to Lazeez for about a year since I start dating the bf and he opened my eyes to this unassuming shawarma with no decade of history like ahem another one. 

Soooooooo good! I've tried their chicken, shish tawouk, falafel, many things on the rocks and on rice. 

Everything is delicious...making my mouth water!

Taste, size, meat vs veggie vs pita ratio is great!

The people are always nice and they are consistent across their 4 sauga locations!

Can't wait to watch them expand ^_^"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but it didn't go as plan. I order the beef tiki and the beef tasted old. Oh well"}
{"text":"Simple menu... Good food.. chicken on the rocks was a delight... Small seating space.. but good middle Eastern food made up for it"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed of the food here at Lazeez. I expected something fresh and vibrant but in the end was left with a soggy mess, lacking textures and flavors which was all muddled by the over excessive house sauce. 

We ordered a chicken shawarma platter and a medium lazeez on the rocks and just let me say that getting the platter alone is enough for two people. While the value is excellent and over the top here, there's plenty of salad, and potatoes, I just couldn't eat that much food because it was extremely heavy from all that sauce. I felt a bit sickish even. There's just too much sauce there, if I do return I'd request less sauce but the foundation of the food here wasn't up to par either. Spicy levels here is determined by how much (red spicy) sauce they add. The spicier, the more sauce there is. 

The rice was a bit too wet, and wasn't that fragrant, while the chicken was pretty flat and lacked a roastedness to it.The sauce could have been more garlicky and there wasn't any hummus in the platter! I didn't know they could serve middle eastern food without hummus. 

As I said they do give you a lot of salad and potatoes as well, but you're better of just sticking with the on the rocks option to maximize the value here. It didn't help that the person taking our order here input the wrong thing and had to fix it after telling him."}
{"text":"There may be something wrong with my taste buds as I find the two most popular shawarma restaurants in Mississauga (Osmows & Lazeez) wildly overrated.

Came here on a Monday at 8:30pm and it was uncomfortably packed.Every table was full with customers waiting for their food (few actually eating) and there was a line that went from the counter (back of the shop) to the front exit.

Okay, I thought, if people are willing to wait this long for some cheap shawarma then it must be good, right?

I ordered a chicken shawarma wrap. It took about 20-25 minutes. Your wait times will likely be longer than you'd expect because you have to wait for everyone ahead of you in line as well as everyone waiting at tables to get their food. While waiting, I took a look around and realized just how unkept everything felt - tables/booths falling apart, garbage bins overflowing, dark lighting. It caught me by surprise since the plaza has many other newer looking establishments.

I wasn't very happy with how the 6 people I dined with all received our orders at different times... Half our group was done eating by the time the other half got their orders. This shouldn't happen, especially given that we ordered together.

I was also unsatisfied with the variance in spice level among the wraps in our group. Three of us ordered a medium spice level, but mine wasn't hot at all, whereas my friend could barely eat hers. Surely enough, we took a bite out of her wrap and her medium was wayyy hotter than ours.

Lazeez is really popular - I was surprised when I saw lineups longer than Osmows'. There's a lot of hype around them that I personally believe is unsubstantiated. I don't think I'd dine here often if wait times were 5 minutes, but 25 minutes? That's just overkill. There are better places for shawarma, even if they're less popular."}
{"text":"Chicken samosas were delicious, significantly smaller than picture in menu.  Service was just ok.  Chicken shawarma was not as tasty as I was expecting, really tomato and oniony.  Fries were nice."}
{"text":"Awful place. Don't go here!! My first bite was a hard chicken bone that scratched my throat. I asked for the chef to come out so I could let him know that there was a chicken bone in my first bite and he denied there were any bones in the dish. Giving them the benefit of doubt, I took my next bite, and there again CHICKEN BONES! Chicken biryani also to be also made with white chicken meat, there meat was brown and made from thighs. They charge almost $12 for this crap too! They only refunded $8 for something when I asked for my money back. This was my worse Las Vegas food experience to date. DO NOT GO HERE!! THEY GET AN F-!!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. The atmosphere and the energy within this place was very pleasant. I received a discount coupon for doing surveys online and found this place which was right down the street from where we lived and so my husband and I decided to go out for new restaurant experience. I ordered the chicken curry and my husband got the famous chicken masala dish. The chicken curry was superb with turmeric and other Indian spices. I had it at a level five spicy which you can choose between 1-10 on the spice level. It was perfect! The chicken masala was creamy and remanescent to buttered chicken and was so good. I really love this place. They even have a rewards program which is worth getting. We will definitely visit again and bring friends!!!"}
{"text":"Lazeez is one of my all time favourite shawarma places in Mississauga. Their chicken on the rocks and chicken on the sticks are above par compared to most shawarma places, although their chicken shawarma wraps are sometimes slightly soggy. Still very good and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great taste and give you nice big portions so you don't feel cheated.! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"My go-to place for \"chicken on rice\" - shawarma chicken on a bed of rice (fries optional), doused in sauce. Delicious and great value for the portion size. Wait time can be a hassle though, and calling in advance for your order doesn't save any time. I love NYC's Halal Guys more, but this is the best alternative I've had in the GTA."}
{"text":"Be prepared to have your taste buds knocked off. Also, after having lazeez, all other foods will taste like steamed veggies. The chicken shwarma platter on the rocks is sooooooo mouth-gasmic. And super cheap!"}
{"text":"First time here based on all the reviews sounds like food is great however, having to wait 45 minutes for takeout is ridiculous---especially if it's because the service behind the counter to prepare an order that's already cooked.  There is no sense of urgency despite being standing room only.  It's one thing to have great food but another not to appreciate your customers paying the bills..."}
{"text":"Great place for a healthier spin on fast food! \"On the Rocks\" is my favourite- with both fries and rice. Yum!
It's like a better halal guys."}
{"text":"Used the Yelp Eat 24 service for the first time.  Very convenient!  Thanks Yelp!  

Meant to get kabobs as I promised myself last time, but wasn't feeling it today.  Instead lamb shawarma wrap fantabu-marvelistically deliciousrama excellent!!!  Firmly recommended.  Of course its spicyy ttsssss...
Falafels are okay a tad on the dry side; ordered with tzatziki sauce which helped.  Except the tzatziki was watered down in appearance and texture.  
Baba ganoush with pita is great.  I put some BG in my shawarma to make an unforgettable yep!  Ma il mio bel ama il cibo cinese.  Next time my sweetheart.
When in doubt, always get baklava.  Only sweet tooths understand this dilemma.  There is no counseling for being a sweet tooth except for silent therapy with sweets.

A lost star in rating though since I weigh on customer service.  At the time of using the Yelp Eat 24 method I had even tipped in advance.  When I picked up my food, I stood waiting cuz I thought I had to sign the receipt.  But only after I asked I learned it's prepaid. I can just take my bag and go.  Users of Yelp Eat 24 get an itemized email which serves as the receipt.  I trusted my order was prepared correctly and I'd forgotten to check the bag before I left.  I get home gladly to see order is correct and still hot.  But no napkins...

For the fact that they serve Indian and Mediterranean cuisines, I'll still order from them, but in person."}
{"text":"Came here with my pops today for lunch. We were supposed to go to Mint Leaf Bistro, but we ended up here on accident. 

As soon as we walked in around 1 pm, there was literally no one in the restaurant. We were hesitant on whether we should stay or go. I gave them a quick search on yelp, saw their 4 star rating, and decided to give them a shot. Their food looked pretty good from the pictures as well so why not. 

We each ordered the chicken curry lunch special (spicy level 6 for my dad and spicy level 8 for me on a scale of 4-10) and split a chicken tandoori and garlic naan. The chicken curry was super flavorful, and the chicken was really juicy and tender. The chicken tandoori was also a hit, and the garlic naan was soft and fluffy. The curry could have been spicier so I'll go with level 10 next time. The lunch specials also include rice and your choice of soda.

The only complaint I have is that the pre-set silverware was dirty (had some kind of food smear on them). I tried to replace them with the ones on the tables next to us, but they were also dirty. I hope they do a better job of washing and polishing their silverware. 

Oh and for real though, I straight up had some of the worst gas for a good 4 hours after this meal. I don't know what they put in that curry, but it's some potent stuff. 

All in all, it was a pleasant experience, and the food was a lot better than I expected. I'll definitely be back for that chicken curry and to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"The place is absolute chaos. First called for delivery because on Yelp said there was but actually don't. Then made an order to pickup which definitely did not help speed up the process as it still took a total of 35 min from when I ordered. I think they didn't actually put in my order until I got there. Ordered the mixed grill which was supposed to come with rice, hummus and fries but the container only included rice and some other kind of potato. Also got an order of fatoosh that was made almost entirely of shredded lettuce.

Also extremely annoying when I was handed my order I asked specifically if it contained utensils and was told yes, everything was in there. My poor experience was topped off by no utensils included in the bag when I got back to my hotel. I recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying curry and I was not disappointed! The food was great, the staff was fun and helpful. Definitely will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"We got 2 chicken shawarma plates. Quite a lot of food: rice, choice of salad, 2 whole potatoes like you get at a Greek restaurant and shredded white and dark meat chicken. Cashier/servers weren't too friendly but weren't un-friendly either. Good tingle from the hot sauce."}
{"text":"One of the closes Indian restaurants in my area. The food is always on point and amazing. The service could be slightly better and communication when calling on the phone, BUT literally the food makes up for all of that."}
{"text":"I ordered and started watching a movie with the family, before I knew it the movie was wrapping up and still no food nor phone call. Roughly an hour and a half had passed so I called the restaurant to see what was going on. The delivery guy calls back sounding frustrated and says he's lost and had been walking around the complex for 15 minutes trying to find my apartment. He hangs up and a few minutes later he pulls up and says \"this place is f**king confusing.\" Gave me my bags of food and turned back to his car. No, 'hey sorry about the mix up' or any kind of apology just another \"F**K!\" as he got into his car, I'm guessing because his phone started ringing? The food was cold, horrible customer service and over an hour and a half for food so I called the manager to explain the situation. She asked what would I like to do and I asked for a refund. She said that would not be a problem. I spoke to the Eat24 rep she said she was unable to start the refund because the manager told her she didn't have time to talk to her or give her permission for the refund and to call back tomorrow. Food was subpar, customer service was horrendous and communication was garbage. Will never eat here or order from here again and will tell everyone I know to stay FAR away from this place..."}
{"text":"So it's Saturday of the long weekend and we're spending the day shopping when we realize, it's WAY past lunchtime and we're starving!

Not being familiar with the area we were in, we hopped onto Yelp, as one does, and did a quick search. We found a Shawarma place and headed that way!

We found it, walked in, and to our surprise, there wasn't a menu to be found! The guy behind the counter told us how they had taken over from the previous place and that they didn't have their menus yet. He proceeded to tell us what they had and we opted for the chicken shawarma dinner plate. 

So here's the kicker, as they were preparing our meals, we get to talking... and find out... they're not even open for business yet. Apparently we didn't see the sign which clearly stated 'Coming Soon'. Oops! Thanks for feeding us anyway! :) 

The service was good, the portion size was good, the food was good and I highly recommend getting their hot sauce! A-OK in my books but an extra star for accommodating us!"}
{"text":"Walk through the door and you're automatically met with a wall of AMAZING smells. ThE AROMA ALONE will make you starving. I came at 3:45 pm and the establishment was completely empty besides myself and the employees. The staff was extremely pleasant while taking my order and gave me 10% off for checking in on yelp. I will definitely be coming back to test their other menu items. The prices are also pretty cheap/reasonable. Definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My girlfriend and I will always do the \"where should we eat...\" back and forth trying to think of a place we are both craving. One of us will suggest Lazeez and it's not long before we start placing our order. We always end up getting Lazeez. It's so perfect! We probably eat there on a weekly basis.

She always gets the aloo gobhi and I always get chicken vindaloo, can't recommend those enough. Great gyros as well! Staff is always helpful and friendly when I call in."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Naan is amazing and the curry seasonings are always on! Be careful when asking for a level 10 heat! They will make it a 10 for you! It's almost too hot in my opinion. I want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town! I would rate it 5 stars but the wait time puts it down. I love the owners both mr and mrs but they have to do something to lessen the wait time for each customer. Half an hour is the norm and the regulars (like me) never seem to bother. We still go no matter what!"}
{"text":"We (my wife and I) have been coming to Lazeez for a while. We enjoy the pleasant atmosphere and the consistently good service and food. Lola does a great job helping us feel comfortable and making sure that we enjoy our experience. Among our favorites are Chilli Chicken, Nihari, and Chicken Biryani."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everytime my family and I come here we have great food and great service. If you are in town visiting or are a local you cannot go wrong. My favorite dish here is the chicken tandoori. The appetizers are also amazing they have chicken and vegetable samosas which is what I usually get. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Big fan of Indian food and didn't really expect much on my first visit to the restaurant. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. The menu had a wide range of choices. The service was decent, but could be better. I ordered chili chicken for the first time to-go and it was fantastic. Great portion size for both dinner or lunch. Definitely would come back again. They also have lunch special!"}
{"text":"We were so impressed with the food here. It was fresh and delicious. The staff are friendly and helpful. The Mediterranean salad was amazing as was our entire dinner. It has a relaxing atmosphere and is well decorated and very clean."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, however you're going to wait about 15-20min to receive your order and it may not be your order,  but someone else's. So keep an open eye as they prepare it if you can keep track because the employees appear puzzled behind there. Get ready to kill 20 min waiting for your order. In addition, floor and tables are dirty. Keep an eye for who touches your food and how it's handled."}
{"text":"So i have been searching for Indian food close to my house for do long! I ordered the Falafel Vegetarian Appetizer plate and the poree. I also got the chance to try the Aaloo Cholay. Everything was perfect. The  spices were beautiful and the falafel were crunchy on the outside and had a lovely texture on the inside. Also, the  staff was amazing as well. I am excited to go back and try more of the food."}
{"text":"I don't like to be mean, but I have to tell the truth about my experience at this place. I LOVE Mediterranean food, especially Lebanese cuisine. I've had food from varying restos who create fusion to completely authentic so I know good Lebanese/ Mediterranean when I taste it- this was not it. Because of all the positive stars I was really looking forward to my visit and meal- what a huge let down! When I first walked in, it seemed ok, until you get to the back where the ordering happens. Place was run down and not clean. There were only 4 customers ordering (myself included) so they weren't busy at all. Behind the counter were more employees than customers and one was in plan view eating his lunch- so unappetizing! When it was my turn to order, there was no greeting at all- he just looked at me. So I placed an order for a large chicken shawarma. He took my money then walked away. Ok.. Then about 5 min later someone screams \"Who ordered the chicken?\" Why are you screaming... there is now only 2 customers waiting for food? Apparently the scream was to ask for my level of spiciness. I told him, he flat ironed my sandwich, took it out and just gave it to me like I wasn't even a paying customer. Seriously? I PAID to be treated like this? Unbelievable. On top of all this mistreatment, the sandwich didn't even taste like anything... Just very peppery hot. OMG a 20 min drive out of my way for absolutely nothing! I suspect the food is covered in sauce because it really is nothing special. Don't waste your time or money here. There are many many more restaurants in the city with better food, and who actually like customers!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. I am willing to go again and try something else. The server was nice!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Lazeez this weekend, and definitely will return. As mentioned in other reviews, the one bad side is the wait time.  I did not go inside, as GF went inside while I went to Tim's and thought we could meet up after, but I had to wait about another 15 mins. 

She bought 2 large beef shawarma and I was shocked at how big the Large is! There were plenty of beef in that big wrap! I don't have shawarmas as often these days, but this would have to be my go to place now, especially so close to me."}
{"text":"Rich, delicious, plentiful servings made me love this place!! My only wish is that I wanted onion chutney which was not on the menu. Other than that, loved it!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Garlic naan, Gyro and Chicken Biriyani were all delicious.  Loved the cucumber tzatziki sauce, thinner than most I have had and also the addition of shredded carrots was yummy.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch today. I didn't know they had buffet, I was starving so we opted in. 

The place is relaxing, well-lit, and clean.

The buffet is $12.99, all Indian dishes. They had a lot of chicken dishes such as
~Chicken Chilli, Chicken Curry, Chicken Tandoori.

Chilli Chicken was flavorful and the chicken cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. The Paneer tikka Masala were better than most restaurants. I loved the Samosas and the Garlic naan, the naan were crispy, fresh and thin.

I have to say that most people would love the level of spice in these dishes.  I do prefer my food on the hot side, and I could stand for more spiciness.

The waitress was very attentive.

Throw some Goat Curry, beef dishes or Mediterranean food on the buffet, I would keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! Great food, great atmosphere, great service! What more could you ask for?! Definitely our favorite halal spot in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"This was the first time my boyfriend and I ate at this establishment. the food was great and the waitress was very helpful, and The establishment was very clean. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is great, I've come here quite a lot and it's always a great experience from the food to the customer service. I've dined in and also done carry out. The lunch buffet is a great option to try a lot of options at the same time that maybe you normally wouldn't order. I'm a vegetarian so this place is a must. I'll definitely be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Lazeez tenth line.... This is my goto spot when I'm hungry and I want to get the most satisfaction out of my meal.. gladly my family feels the same way and it's a quick in and out sort of thing.. lazeez on the rocks with both Fries and rice is my favourite although all their food is outstanding... the good part is it's never too heavy on the pocket either... keep it rocking u guys"}
{"text":"I not Arab but I had these Lebanese sanwiches and food in many places. Nothing tops this place. Tried a few of their dishes and have been amazed. I highly recommend this place for a qick bite to eat and good value for your money."}
{"text":"Shawarma platter is a total bust,a whole bunch of french fries and rice with very little chicken.
On the other hand the sandwiches were nice,we tried their chicken shawarma and sheesh tawook.
It would be perfect if they added some garlic paste like true shawarma places do,but overall it was nice."}
{"text":"Seems like every time we have visited the prices have gone higher. The food is so-so. They don't honor their menu prices and tell you oh we changed the price. There are other better places to eat."}
{"text":"I usually get the Chili chicken with rice and it's always so juicy and amazing. The staffs here was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu as well. (I have a friend working here too!) It didn't take long for our food to come out so that's a plus! This place is usually pretty empty but it's huge! There's a lot of options to choose from in the menu and i'm going to come back here to try all the indian dishes. You can also check in using yelp to get a free soda! Also I don't know the name of this sauce that's white/green literally tastes like mouthwash! (so heads up don't try it!) They also offer a lunch buffet that i've been needing to try because it's looks so tasty. But overall, This place is pretty good and a great place to dine but there's other places to try that's way better, but i'll be back here to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  We just had lunch here and the food is really delicious!   Big plus...all their meat is 100% halal.  My husband and I each ordered the chicken masala and we had enough left over for dinner as well.  We were thinking of ordering the chicken curry instead with white meat, but decided on the masala.  A very nice woman (who I'm assuming was the owner) sent over a small plate of the curry at no charge so we could taste it.  The service is excellent, the food is excellent and the location is perfect as it's five min. away from our house.  We will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"We just moved to this area and checked this place out on our moving day.
Host is really nice. Gave us two more mango drinking as welcome to the neighborhood. Curry is great and my wife really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Chicken-on-the-rocks! That's all you need to know, that's all you need to order. Juicy pieces of chicken on tender rice all smothered with a delicious, garlicky sauce. Go with the hot sauce on it but only sparingly as anything beyond medium spicy level will burn up your stomach.

Tremendous value for your money, absurdly large portions.

This place is chaotic, confusing and slow - the perfect recipe for a place with great eats!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Great food with authentic Indian flavors and lots of menu options. The Mediterranean side of the menu is fairly basic but still delicious.
The spice level is on the mild side so if you like it hot order 8+
Chicken tikka masala is a household favorite. My 2 year old loves it! (Spice level 5).
Naan is a must have and the Raita is delicious (has a nice spicy kick)
Service is good, restaurant is clean, and prices are reasonable. 
If you are near the Summerlin area this is definitely a stop you should make."}
{"text":"Pretty solid, and definitely better than Osmows.  Been coming here for the last year or so, and while I do like it, there are some things not to like.  

Mostly:  too much sauce.  never have lentil rice lately.  chicken can be rubbery and fatty sometimes, also a huge pet peeve when it isn't finely chopped up and in huge chunks.  Not as tender

This being said, it's still better than Osmows which has just gone right to crap outside of their original Streetsville location..  And that one is way too slow.

My order is the 1/2 and 1/2

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The service was better some time back. Now they just do not care that you paid for the food. They just believe in sending you away after taking the money.

The chicken quantity has dramatically been reduced for on the rock servings. 

The hygiene is seriously questionable. Surprised as to why health officials have not shut down the location.

However the food taste great."}
{"text":"Whooooooo I have to say that's the # 1 costumer service and the food was delicious 
Will keep coming over with family and friends
We recommend that place to anyone that like good Food and healthy........"}
{"text":"Lazeez staff is always super friendly. It is kind of a far drive for me and the food is always ready promptly. I love that they have veggie pakora and the tikka masala is delicious. I want to try the Korma next. One sauce is too spicy for me and one too sweet, but it's a great restaurant with great food."}
{"text":"Lazeez is the best Indian mediterranean grill restaurant in Las Vegas. Authentic dishes and very friendly stuff. They also do DELIVERY :) , so top 3 on my favorite online restaurants list. Thanks you guys, more then 400 orders and not even one mistake. also busy all the time so thats a sign"}
{"text":"Ordered through Amazon Restaurants last night and it was delicious!!! The chili chicken was to die for and spicy! garlic naan was on point, rice perfectly fluffy and flavorful, veggie samosas were outstanding, tikka masala pretty good, raita was perfect to cool everything down. Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Before my walk in experience... I've only had this as take out at my friend's house who lives close by. we came during the dinner rush at 6pm and it was busy...but the line moves fast. I ordered the chicken platter and my friend ordered the chicken on the rocks (rice). Overall, portions here are generous. We both could gave share the chicken platter. It comes with rice, potatoe or fries, and chicken over top, then smothered with garlic and tahini sauce, with a side order of salad. The sauce was okay.. Wasn't amazing. It's actually kind of a turn off that they use so much sauce... Made it really unappealing... And maybe it's because they're trying to cover up the fact that their chicken is dry. What else do you do when your meat is dry? Drench it in sauce! Anyways, I only finished half of it. The tables are kind of dirty. Garage laying around from the previous people. They were also out of potatoes so it was either more rice or fries. Next time,  Ill only get chicken on the rocks -  half rice/fries. Overall, average flavour, big portions, relatively cheap and heavy eats. Comparable to osmow's."}
{"text":"I know this place is kinda new but it does need some work.. 

Small but clean establishment 

Unfriendly staff, not necessarily rude but the woman waiting on us was giving off a very \"I don't want to be here\" vibe 

She couldn't separate our payments which was very 
inconvenient 


Lunch buffet-
The food was ok, not amazing, not a big selection, maybe 7 dishes. The side sauces weren't labeled so I had to wing it, luckily i love I Indian so I knew what everything was, they do not have chili sauce out which was slightly annoying but I asked and they brought it out.. the garlic naan was very dry and crispy, some bites better than others."}
{"text":"I went with my mom to try some new food. But what I got was not up to my expectations. The service was slow and when we asked if the bread had gluten and the one waitress went in the back to ask. It took her 10 minutes to Anwser. Then once we finally ordered it was another 30 before we got it. Then since we had still not gotten our drinks we asked the girl. She said she would remind them and then left for another 10 before delivering the last of our food then getting our drinks."}
{"text":"I am someone who hasn't had Indian/Mediterranean food in a really long time! (5years) from the last time I remembered it I really enjoyed it and I remember the bread (naan?) was pretty crispy. Anyways this place is really good! The bread is definitely not crispy..but still good! I had chicken samosas, chicken tikka masala, and binyani raita. I loved the tikka masala of course.. because it isn't spicy!! I am unfortunately not in the club for spicy-Ness. It is pretty creamy and it comes with a side of rice! My second fav was the chicken samosas! Some pink sauce is sweet and the green sauce is...green hahaha i can't explain the taste but definitely worth trying! And the last one was the biryani with raita. This one is the some what spicy one. Keep in mind that I don't like spicy food so this might not even be spicy for someone who loves it. The bread (naan) is kind of chewy bread? Still really good! Everyone go try it once!..you might just like it (=


I ordered on the phone for pick up btw.. and the girl asked me the spicy-Ness level for the biryani and I said 0.. she laughed and said the lowest we have is level 4.. hahahhaha! Kind of pricy btw.. but portions are big!"}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of Osmows, I would almost go there every single day. However for the past year the service there has been horrible and the quality and taste of food has went absolutely down hill. All you taste is bland chicken and cartilage. 

Ever since Lazeez opened up my shawarma addiction has come back to life! AMAZING shawarma. The owner Rafat is very nice although he looks angry, hes not! Its just his face! He worked at Osmows for many years and now is taking over the shawarma market. 

Lazeez is a MUST try. From the chicken on the rocks, to the shawarma all the way to the beef donair.

Amazing food!"}
{"text":"Favourite shawarma place to eat in Mississauga. Consistent, good food. People in previous reviews complain about the service however you need to keep in mind this is an in and out place. The owner is nice enough to employee some immigrant/refugees so the language barrier may come off as rude. Highly recommend this place - and all locations!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here randomly with my daughter . So glad we did ! We love Indian and the food here is excellent . Clean - huge place with excellent service ! We will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent halal place in Las Vegas on the west side. While the drive for us was a bit lengthy, the food and ambiance was well worth it. I'd recommend the Nihari on the weekend for a truly memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"I don't know what Osmow's is. I keep hearing about it, and Tanya G. tells me that it's somewhat similar to Lazeez, but since I have no point of reference, I can't really say if it's better or worse. What I can say is: Lazeez was multiple kinds of amazing. Delightfully messy (more on that in a bit), but easily one of the spiciest, filling(est), and satisfying(est) meals I've had recently. 

Also, the sheer amount of food for the price is kind of crazy. The wraps were $5-$6 before tax, which was surprisingly cheap (to me), especially once my eyes beheld the size of said wraps. They're like... Babies. You could cradle the thing in your arms. Like an infant. Which is creepy on many levels. I probably could have eaten half of mine and been satisfied for a few hours, but portion control? Ain't nobody got time for that.

We ordered two wraps. The Chicken Shawarma, and the Lazeez Special. The Lazeez Special apparently has potatoes or something in it, and me being the fattie that I am, I take every opportunity to add potatoes to my food stuffs. Get extra garlic and extra spicy sauce on the wraps, but be warned: They will take your request seriously. The extra sauces resulted in a significantly messy, and challenging meal. You'll need a fork and knife. And maybe a bowl to catch everything as it falls. An entire tree gave its life so that I could wipe my mouth and hands during the course of our meal.

There was a bit of confusion when we ordered. The guy heard Lazeez Special, but he thought we were asking about their wrap specials. So we ended up with two Chicken Shawarmas despite our attempts to explain our choices. I realized something was up when no precious potatoes were to be found in my wrap, but I shrugged my shoulders and kept eating. Then the guy who made our wraps realized his mistake, and made us another wrap (the aforementioned Lazeez Special) and gave it to us (with an apology). At this point, I had already finished eating my wrap, and half of Tanya G.'s and I was dealing with a sizeable food baby. I can't tell you what the Lazeez Special tastes like because my food baby stopped me but it's safe to say it's just as delicious as the Chicken Shawarma. The fact that they threw in an extra wrap at no charge was some unexpected, yet appreciated customer service. We ended up giving the extra wrap away. I'm filled with so much regret about that.

Summary: Filling, unhealthy (I consider this to be a positive quality), delicious, cheap, along with excellent customer service. Again, I don't know if Osmow's is comparable, but Lazeez has certainly made a fan of me."}
{"text":"We just walked in to this restaurant to place an order for a shawarma plate  and a shawarma wrap. There was a big lineup and when they finally called our number to hand out our order, they gave us two containers in a bag. We came home to find they only gave us the platter and the shawarma wrap is missing. When my husband called them on the phone to ask why the wrap is missing, they were very unapologetic and said they called our order number twice, but found we had already left after taking the first parcel. We pointed out they should have told us that what they are giving is only part of the order, OR they should have kept BOTH Items and called our number, so the mistake could have been avoided..esp as we drove to the joint and were not within walking distance of this place. When we drove to collect the forgotten food item, they had the temerity to shake their heads and behave as if it was our fault that this incident happened. Mistakes like this can happen, but what astounds us is the lack of customer service and unapologetic way they had handled this situation. We only ordered 2 items, imagine if we ordered more. We are never coming back to this place again...very bad service on what was already a mediocre joint to start with."}
{"text":"As me and my wife like all the flavor of Indian food, Lazeez make that twisted with Mediterranean touch. We had few time their Kabob plates and the Salads they all taste great and good flavors. Great service and insider this place is nicely decorated. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I watched as this restaurant opened after the previous restaurant closed and when I found out it was an Indian/Mediterranean one, I was anxious to give it a try.  I stopped in for a late dinner a few nights ago.

The meal was good.  I was surprised when I saw an Indian restaurant serving a beef curry stew but I realized the Northern Indian cuisine and the Middle Eastern might be the reason for this.  I ordered the Nihari which the menu describes as a ... \"traditional spicy beef curry, another royalty from India.\"  With it, I got an order of garlic naan and some iced tea. On a spiciness level of 1 to 10, I ordered 8.

After ordering, you take a seat and put one of the posts holding your number so they know which table to deliver the food.  While waiting, I got my iced tea from a separate room where the fountain drinks and iced tea were kept.

The wait was no that long and it gave me a chance to get some photos of the interior.  When the dinner came, it was on a school-like lunch tray.  The nihari was in an aluminum foil 'bowl' and the naan was on the side.  In addition, the curry came with some thinly sliced ginger and some jalapeño slices.  The utensils were plastic.

The nihari was very tasty and nicely spiced.  I did dump all the ginger and jalapeño into the stew and it certainly cleared my sinuses before I was finished.  The naan didn't have much of a garlic flavor, but it was fresh and hot and made a good soaker for some of the curry.

A couple of things come to mind when reviewing Lazeez.  I really dislike paying normal restaurant prices to eat as if I'm in a school cafeteria.  Plastic utensils, get your own drinks, aluminum foil bowls--these are all the things that detracted from what was some good food.  If I were to return, it would be for takeout.  At least I'd have proper utensils.  

A couple of other things.  I asked what came with the meal and the person at the register said just rice.  There was never any rice.  The online menu shows the dish with naan.  I was charged for naan.  Maybe that was an additional charge because of the garlic naan.  

The restaurant is strange.  When you walk in, you have a choice of two ways to go--one through the beverage area which looks like it may be bar seating in the future or you can go to your left and past some tables to get into the place.  Walking straight ahead will take you into a divider which is an odd setup.  There are two distinct eating areas and they're completely different.  I can't figure out who designed the interior but I might have been able to do better.  I'm not sure how much the previous place figures in its current design but it is odd.

Altogether it was good food which was detracted by the way it's served especially that damned, little plastic spoon.  Oh, and spend a little extra and get some decent napkins instead of giving a customer 5 of thin small diner ones."}
{"text":"I love their chicken shawarma on the rocks; great for those that love big portions. The hot sauce is flavourful and sometime hot so be careful!"}
{"text":"Went there long time ago,  the food was okay. I guess it was just the beginning.  
I visited the place again and I was happy.  Food was good,  portion was good.  
A nice quick shawarma run. very good location.  
Keep it up. :)"}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place.
So ventured in at lunch time to be the only customer, followed any a few more tables. It was quiet.

I was greeted by a young lad, warm welcome must say. Was offered the menu right away and guided towards the veggie section, as I asked for it. 

Interesting menu, a mix of Middle-eastern and Sub-continent cuisine. Looking at the menu, I most certainly was confused, I could not figure out what kind of cuisine I should have - Middle-Eastern - Indian - Pakistani - North African

I finally made my choice of Samosa and Chan Chat - I as they seemed to be safe bets 

The Samosa is no way close to an Indian samosa, its good but I expected an Indian Samosa, The chana chat, was something weird. I have never tasted this kinda of chana flavor or presentation. Maybe a middle-eastern style. I am not a expert of that cuisine, so will not comment.

Overall its a interesting place, will surely try it again only with middle-eastern cuisines expert/s to truly understand what they are offering here."}
{"text":"This is my go-to rice and chicken on the rocks, I think it's better than Osmows. But, the line up is ridiculous, I waited close to 45 minutes at around 8pm on a Thursday!  Try to go before 5pm or call in to place your order. You would still have to line up but at least you have priority.

I always get their Lazeez on the rocks with half rice and half fries with extra sauce on the side! This is the closest thing to NY's Halal Guys mixed platter! I miss it so much...*sigh. But this really hits the spot and I love how they are not stingy with their sauce. Their chicken is not dry at all and the rice is cooked to perfection. I get mild and my boyfriend always gets his extra extra extra HOT!  The fries are soo crispy and goes well with the chicken and sauce (I'm drooling as I write this) I suggest eating at the resto so your fries won't get soggy.

I've been here a couple of times and it's never dead, this place is definitely poppin!"}
{"text":"We ordered food from here for a small gathering at Home. We ordered for 15 people but got food for 20-25! The portions were huge!
We ordered the salad which is so popular with the toasted pita on top. Dressing on the side so it didn't get soggy.
The rice with lentils was topped with fried onions and so flavourful and filling. It was a hit with everyone.
The chicken was liked by all the carnivores but the falafel wasn't a hit. The falafel was fried, too crispy and dry.
The garlic sauce, tahini and hot sauce were enjoyed by everyone but I found the hot sauce too spicy (I didn't have the garlic sauce due to dairy in it.
The meal was hot when we picked it up and served in aluminum trays. Easy clean up !"}
{"text":"The food was really good I had the chicken tiki masala with plain naan and I got it to go. I went during the day so it wasn't busy. The young lady at the counter was very nice. My lunch was ruined by my dog when I got home she dumped the chicken onto my carpet and the sauce got all over her just bathed paws. So yes I will have to go back and dine in. But the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine. My mom. Brother, and i just finished dining here. My mom travels the world and india is one of her stops frequently. This is the most authentic indian food she has had since leaving india. Only thing better than the food was the service.  Lola is so sweet and attentive. The combination of the excellent food and service is why this is going to be our regular restaurant when we meet for our regular dinners."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype about this place. The waits are so long and the garlic sauce they use in the shawarmas tastes like goo."}
{"text":"Extremely rude service. I think this place should be avoided overall for its rude service. They don't use high grade quality ingredient either. My pita was literally breaking apart as they don't use quality pita either."}
{"text":"Really delicious and the portions are huge ! I always get the chicken shawarma combo (shawarma, side rice, & a drink) for $8.50. The garlic sauce and hot sauce are amazing (careful tho, hot sauce is actually spicy !!). There are long lines but anyone that is complaining about that is stupid. The only way for them to be faster is to build an extension or become less busy! The wait time has to do with an overload  of orders and not lack of efficiency. Also, a quick tip for people who don't like waiting .. You can call ahead and place your order (give them 10-15 mins). They will work on it asap and when you get there the only line you will have to wait in is the one to the register."}
{"text":"Seriously, fuck this place. Rude people work there, I paid for 5 shawarmas and only got 4. When I talked to them on the phone they said come in whenever and we will give you a free shawarma. I go in a week later and they say they have never heard of me. They said come in the next day when our managers here and I did, when I got there they said we have resolved the issue the previous day and they can't do anything about. Fuck those people. The shawarmas maker is some dude who used to work at osmos, faggot copies them and he looks like he hates life. Go fuck yourself lazeez. Would not recommend to anyone and I warn you to stay away from these assholes"}
{"text":"Based on their reviews, we gave them a try.  You would think after being in business for so many years, their food would be over the top.  The staff was friendly and attentive; however, the food was no more than a 2-star and we are Mediterranean foodies.  The chicken and beef had an off flavor and aroma.  You can do much better at Poulet du Jour in Hermosa Beach."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I love it. 
Pros:
-the decor is really nice and well thought out
-the staff is nice (Jamie at the front counter was helpful and polite)
-the food is fresh and delicious 
-lots of menu options (my husband and I are vegan and they had lots to choose from)
-they bring your food to you 
-good music 


I was going to take away a star because the price is a little high for a self serve place, but after tasting the food, I understand why. I got the veggie burger and onion rings, the veggie burger seemed like it was house made fresh and very tasty. They even brought out ketchup and ranch for my onion rings without me having to ask. The onion rings did not taste frozen. My husband got a falafel wrap and we both loved it. We also got the baklava but were to full to eat it. But it looks good! :P Overall this place is solid and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I was in the area and saw I had this bookmarked on yelp...score! I am always down for a Shawarma! I had just come from an appointment and had nothing in my body... I was STARVING....I walked in at 11:30 am and from reading previous reviews I expected to wait. The restaurant was extremely busy.... most seats were taken and there was a line of about 5-6 people in front of me...at 11:30am people... on a thursday morning! After seeing the amount of people I thought to myself, \"this place has to be amazing!\" I browsed through my fellow yelpers suggestions and decided to go with the lazeez on the rocks 1/2 fries 1/2 rice mild (just incase medium was too spicy for me). I ordered the REGULAR size. This was jam packed to the brim with delicious chicken shawarma meaty goodness. The meat was high quality meat in my opinion and the rice and fries mix added a great change of texture to the meal. HOWEVER... the garlic sauce... not the best. This meal would've been 5 stars had the garlic sauce been a bit better... it was almost tasteless. I ate this regular size meal at 11:30 am and was still too full to eat dinner. So this was my only meal all day lol.... THATS how filling it was.

PS. I overheard the men in front of me talking about how the restaurant has a new, faster system... probably the reason why I was in and out of the place in under 5 mins. Great job for fixing the long wait times Lazeez!"}
{"text":"Good food. Chicken tikka masala 
made fresh, Not greasy. 
Chicken samosa's, first time trying 
them were Also good. Tamarind 
and green chutney were Also made 
fresh. Power salad also topped off
Course. Service was good. Vegan 
And gluten free options available.
I would recommend Lazeez."}
{"text":"Always great service, no Matter how busy the are, Best Shawarma! I go at least 3 times a month, never had anything but a great experience."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this restaurant immensely. The service and food were excellent - best Indian food we've had in a long time! We ordered the Chicken Tikki Masala, Goat Biryani, Goat Curry, all excellent & spiced to order. The Buttered Naan was noteworthy because it was fresh but not too doughy. Priced reasonably for the quality, the restaurant setting was charming & clean. The table next to us ordered the Lazeez Beef Burger, and told us that's their favorite (they frequent this restaurant). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Loveee the food, always go there since its close to my house,  but its awkward when the owners fight.. it looks like everyone that comes there often enough gets used to it lol."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I are Vegans and we really appreciate restaurants who have Vegan options and who clearly mark there menu for dishes that can be made Vegan or that are Vegan. The food was absolutely delicious! We enjoyed all of it very much. The only thing that I am surprised about when reading the other reviews here, is that some people said the Spice level was zero. That was not the case for us. In fact, one rice dish we ordered was the lowest spice level of 4 and it was much much too spicy for us and we LOVE spicy food. The owner was very kind and removed the dish from our bill since we could not eat it. I just saw another review and I do agree that the falafels were a bit too dry. I like mine a little more moist. But other than those things, it was a very friendly environment with very good food."}
{"text":"I love the employees! They're so nice and I love the food. I get all vegan and I just have to get different curries every week now. Great place that my coworker and I go for lunch 8)"}
{"text":"Great Falafal. Liked the place and taste of it. But the service was not good was extremely busy and dirty place. You can not eat there. It is just a take-out place. Be prepared to wait for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Went back and tried the tandoori chicken, samosas, chicken tikka masala.  It was excellent.   And I had the lentil soup (daal) which was so delicious as u could taste it was fresh and they used lots of spices.  Service was good and pretty quick for take out."}
{"text":"Expensive... 
Samosas reminded me of the frozen ones in the freezer section at trader joe's ..."}
{"text":"The owner of this place was a cook at Osmows in Streetsville so expect the same taste when you visit this place. Generally speaking the restaurant is usually very busy during weeknights and weekends. Due to the crowd that is there the quality of service is affected but that isn't a big deal since the food is usually \"worth the wait\"."}
{"text":"Finally! A restaurant that has mediterranean and indian food in one! There were plenty of choices to choose from. We ordered the beef shawarma combo and wrap w/ onion rings. You can tell our food was made fresh from the moment we ordered it.  Super clean and upscale decor. We would come back here again to check out their indian food."}
{"text":"I was super excited to find an Indian restaurant close to my home in Summerlin. I love Indian food...like in a manic, pregnancy craving even though I'm not pregnant kind of way. I was over the moon with this place. The chili chicken is to die for. The perfect amount of spice...just enough to cause a glow on my skin but not full blown meat sweats. The naan was delicious and the service was great. I hope this place sticks around...it's definitely my new go-to for delicious Indian food!"}
{"text":"Went for take-out at 8:15 PM yesterday (Thursday) and it wasn't busy at all.  I know that the place gets crazy busy so it's good to go during the off time hours.  

My co-worker Mariam introduced me to this place awhile back.  The nice lady took my order, a Chicken Shawarma platter ($10.62 or $12 even w/ tax), and called me \"Boss\" and asked me if I wanted onions on my salad.  I had bought the platter only a handful the times but most recently, been having a craving for it whenever I go back home to Mississauga.

I have to say, the platter is wonderful.  The meat has a rich shawarma flavour and the sauces (garlic & tahina), by golly, light (not over-powering), creamy and delicious.  Y'all who have visited Osmow's in Streetsville know what I'm talking about.  The hot sauce is HOT.    It makes my cheeks sweat and mouth blazin' but it's a great kick.  Greek salad made for me on the side which was for the most part, fresh with generous feta all around.  The wife loves it so that's a plus for me too.

If you went in the late evening like I did, the common trend is that they run out of their lentils rice so you have to settle for the plain yellow rice.  I went in the past when they ran out of that rice and potatoes too!  Best part about it is that I can never finish the platter and I always have leftovers the next day.

So check this place out if you are around the Heartland area and don't mind cruising 5 minutes West to Creditview and Britannia.  5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"I only order one thing here and it's Lazeez on the rocks. I get it with half fries for an additional 50 cents and half lentil rice. Lentil rice is usually available during lunch time as they do not make any batches for the dinner rush. I suggest only getting the regular order as the large is quite hefty and either way be prepared to take a nap afterwards. I suggest getting it with chicken only. They now offer beef and I asked for mixed shawarma and while it tasted good, I prefer the taste of the chicken only."}
{"text":"~3* for taste
~1* for the wait
~5* for the price

first off, the chicken on the rocks is VERY mediocre, doesn't have the ZING of flavor you'd expect in a shwarma. On top of that the garlic sauce is wayy too creamy and heavy, didn't have much of a garlic taste and kind of stuck to the roof of your mouth..

The price is fantastic for such a big meal which is around $5-6 for a small on the rocks (trust me, it ain't small!)

the queue time made me want to pull my hair out. We went around lunchtime and the line was MASSIVE, which resulted in a wait to order for about 5 minutes, and then another 15 minutes to get the food. After 15 minutes I was informed that they ran out of chicken (hah..) and so we waited another good 15 minutes for that to finish. I came here to get some fast lunch, and spent almost 40 minutes waiting, so its a huge two thumbs down for me."}
{"text":"This rating is based on Friday Buffet. I don't know about the menu food. We were 4 in the group. The restaurant was empty at around 12:00 pm. We came here based on the good ratings in Yelp aand wanted to try the Buffet. First of all, the buffet was very limited, with only Chicken items from meat. I was expecting to find atleast lamb or goat. Nevertheless, the chicken items all tasted the same. Food color was too much. There were dahl, veggie korma, pakora. They were average. The rice was simple plain rice. Did not expect. The naans were okay. And they only had 1 desert. That's it!!! I have eaten indian buffet in many states and this one goes to the bottom of the list. Service was okay. We were so upset with the food that we finished our food within minutes. 2 of our group members have only tried 2 things from thw buffet. I would not recommend the place."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up:
Babaganoush: I don't know if it's because it's Indian but their baba ghanoush has a deathly gray color and a weird bitter after taste. 

Chicken samosa: it's nice and crispy on the outside. The filling is okay, nothing exceptional. The minty sauce goes well with the samosa, the red sauce is too sweet for my taste.

Chicken tikka masala with side of rice: I really liked the tender chicken and the sauce which was delicious and creamy. I ordered it 5 out of 10 with spiciness level. I wish I ordered it spicier. 

Gulab jamun: the syrup was too sweet and watery. The texture is off, I didn't like it.

The place is spacious but only a couple of tables were occupied when I picked up my order. Decor is confusing, not Indian nor Mediterranean motif. At the cashier area, they have moldy desserts in the display case which was disgusting."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in town! My friend and I stumbled upon this place about a year ago and I haven't stopped coming. 
We truly get great service each and every time. The past couple of times in Lola has been our server and she's been devine! The food is always on point and I couldn't ask for anything better.
I've tried a few other Indian cuisine's around town and they didn't hold up to these standards. 
I alway's want to try something new...but tend to get the exact same thing everytime...Shrimp Tikka Masala n Garlic Naan... so im gonna have to come back for the all you can eat buffet to try other items now. Lol"}
{"text":"Came here got lunch with my wife while visiting from San Diego. We had the lunch special buffet. It was very good and the atmosphere and service were great too. Would definitely recommend. I wish I had a chance to try their burgers and shawarma sandwiches as well, but we were only in town for a few days. Definitely next time !"}
{"text":"They have a vegan menu! I ordered the Gyro; super flavorful and included the works. I also ordered a pina colada. Delicious! I crave it sometimes. This place is located right next to Violete's vegan and in the same parking lot as mad house coffee ( which has vegan options) and a pho place next door that also features vegan cuisine!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was so so good! We went back twice before leaving Las Vegas. The food tasted fresh, light and home made. The staff is very friendly. If you love Indian food try Lazeez lunch buffet it is a must!"}
{"text":"Came in from Chicago looking for some zabiha halal breakfast food. The place is nice and clean albeit a bit confusing the way the seating is laid out. We ordered cholay, halwa poori, and nihari. The food was bland and tasteless. The only item that was decent was the garlic naan. We haven't had any Desi chai. for a while so against our better judgment we ordered some chai. Fail again. $42.00 later we just had to write a review."}
{"text":"Great food great service! Lola was very helpful and super friendly . Pretty generous portions . Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered to go from Yelp menu. Their price was $4 higher.  The description said Kabob Platter will be served with rice. After I got home I realized there is no rice. I called them and again they said their menu doesn't say that. Yelp menu is not accurate about ptice and description of the platter. When was the last time you had Mediterranean food without rice. Had a container with 4 different meats and no rice and no bread. Way too expensive for what they give you. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Food was ok... Really expensive. Really pushy for a five star review. I would not go there again. Was not really nice to the deaf customer. Really pushy. Chicken was dry. But to each is their own. People want to enjoy a meal... Not be told review us. 

Asked for pickles and they were pissed off. Kept interrupting my friends conversation."}
{"text":"This was yum yum!  I loved the chicken samosas, but the falafel wasn't very good. The chicken biryani and tandoori skewers, delicious. The naan was tasty and the jasmine rice couldn't be better."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience. My family and I ordered two chicken tikka platters and after taking a few bites, we realized the chicken was clearly not fully cooked. We let the waitress know who at first took it as an insult. After 20 minutes, she brought out the same pieces of chicken reheated. She didn't even bother cooking a fresh new piece. After that terrible service and food, my sister and I had an upset stomachs the whole next day...customers beware."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! Deliciously fresh & tasty!!!! Beautiful ambience!! Very caring and friendly staff!! So far one of the best in town!!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I got Chicken Tikka Masala with 2 garlic naans and Lazeez Raita. While the food does take time to come (15 mins) the food was great at that price. It is less than a lot of other Indian restaurants and taste just as good. i would recommend this place and if you're not sure you should come in at lunch they have a lot of lunch specials at around $10.00."}
{"text":"This place really surprised me. It was sooo good and the staff was super friendly. The prices were great and the atmosphere was very welcoming and inviting. Overall this place was awesome and it's definitely going on our visit again list!!"}
{"text":"Arezoo was an absolute fabulous hostess. Her hospitality and intuitiveness was brilliant upon the naked eye. Can you say \"Lazeez\" was a local favorite now close to home. We loved the food and everything was served with love. I highly recommend and will be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time with my wife.  The chili chicken was spicy & delicious.
The lamb shwarma was tender & very tasty.  All entrees come with salad, basmati rice and flat bread.  The décor was very nice as well.  I also liked the fact that you
order at the counter and the food is brought out to you.
Looking forward to going back and trying some of the
other dishes."}
{"text":"At first when we walked in I thought \"uh oh\" this is going to be a very expensive restaurant.  The decor is beautiful. As it turns out, you order at a counter and they bring the food to you.  I got the Shawrma and we also go the chicken Boti. Both were so full of flavor. The service was exceptionally friendly. Lots of food, which is great because now I will have a delicious lunch tomorrow.  Lazeez is a wonderful place.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"The lazeez on the rocks here is the best!!! Whenever my husband and I are in the Heartland area, we usually decide to get it from here since we haven't found another place that has perfected the ratio of chicken, rice (yay for it not being the thick basmati rice!), garlic sauce and hot sauce as well as this place! The flavours blend perfectly together and it is consistently made well at this Lazeez location. We've been to the other Lazeez locations in Sauga and Osmow's locations but this location is the best one - service wise, efficiency despite line ups and of course, taste of their food! 

It's a no frills type of place so no fancy decor (minimal in fact) and cafeteria style set up where you order at the counter, then wait for your food to come. Reasonable prices for all items - under $11! Good place for take out or sitting in (about 25 seats or so). Enjoy this local gem!"}
{"text":"I ordered beef shawarma and a Chilli chicken with gravy. I also ordered naan bread. I had it delivered to my house. I ran to the store so my wife was home to give the guy the money. The guy was very rude to my wife. My wife has a disease called Diverticulitis and cannot eat seeds. The beef Shawarma had seeds in it. The naan bread was burnt and had no garlic. My chicken chili with gravy was very small and the rice was even smaller. I went back to the place with the food not even touched to get my money back. I was cursed out by a woman employee at the register. They wanted me to talk to the manager about getting my money back basically wanting me to beg. I refused and they didn't give me my money back. My wife could die from those seeds in her food so if they are shut down by a lawsuit don't be surprised. This was the worst customer service I've ever had in Las Vegas do not I repeat do not go to this place"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Their lazeez on the rocks is my personal favourite. Do take note that when they mention spicy it is actually spicy. Usually a long line up at certain hours and definitely late at night. But they keep things going fairly quickly. Have not been disappointed even once so far, and their rice is pretty amazing, alongside the meats and sauce? Too good. Their shawarma wraps are also really good and if you add in the deals of the days this is the best bang for your buck meal.

Do note they have limited seating, though most orders are for take out anyway."}
{"text":"Try the greasy-but-delicious \"Lazeez on the rocks\"- upgrade to the larger size for $2. Juicy chicken (boneless, skinless dark meat) on either rice/ fries/ salad. It's topped with a white sauce (garlic-laced, tangy) and optional hot sauce (mild/ medium/ hot) 

This is a grungy take-out place, some people may find it a bit dirty. The decor is dated, the service isn't the friendliest or quickest, and line-ups during busy times can be irritating. If you're looking for a greasy shawarma fix in Mississauga, this is the spot."}
{"text":"service, food, music, atmosphere was all amazing! We found our new Indian food place!! Price was $$ so it wasn't expensive at all. The hotness levels start at 4- & go to 10. My bf and I both got 5 and it wasn't too spicy. Next time we will do level 6 spice curry"}
{"text":"Price: Low/reasonable prices

Food: (of what we tried) good for what we paid. Not the best but certainly not the worst. Daal was on the salty side. The Beef Kabob was a bit dry and lacking in flavor, but it was a good portion and the sauces provided were ok. Salad was salad. Basmati rice was equally okay. We wouldn't get the mango lassi again. 

Service: Really great! Very attentive, nice, chill. We came in an hour before they were about to close yet they were still very nice. (Also sorry for coming so late)

Establishment: Good vibes and atmosphere. Clean establishment and bathrooms . 

Other: We will definitely come back to try their 12.99 lunch buffet. We're intrigued by other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Try the chicken on rocks with half rice and half fries...extraaaa spicy!!! SOOO good!!! I'd say its definitely better than that other place in streetsville."}
{"text":"Walking into this place I was super confused as to wether someone is supposed to seat me or if I go to the counter or really how to even place an order. I saw no one around anywhere for at least a good minute or two. Finally a worker came out and I let her know I'd like to place a take out order. The worker who helped me along with another worker who completed my payment were not super friendly or talkative.. maybe they're not used to walk in orders.

I ended up ordering the falafel wrap with fries. The portion size was huge which I always love, but the falafel itself was just alright to me. I felt like it needed to be a bit spicer or maybe just a bit more spice in general. I also would have liked more sauce since there was barely any. (3/5) The fries weren't really anything special either, just basic steak fries. 

I think if I ever tried anything else here I'd just get delivery since the whole resturant was like a sad ghost town and super confusing."}
{"text":"Best place to eat. Amazing seasoning and taste! They make your order quickly and efficiently."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Had the Power salad, Samosas and app plater. Wow taste wonderful and have plentyof leftover for later tonight!"}
{"text":"Love this place for Shawarma / Chicken on the rocks. The food has so much flavour.

The one major complaint as I'm sure many people have is the wait time. It took me almost an hour and a half the other day to get my order. 

At the end of the day you can't complain about their quality because the food is really good. Just wish they had better organization!"}
{"text":"I love it!!...  Great service. Nice music.  The food are so yummy with too many vegetarian and vegan options. I will definitely came back."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh and flavorful. We thoroughly enjoyed every bite. Chicken Tiki Masala, chicken samosas and the Mediterranean salad were all outstanding. 
The staff was very friendly and explained the menu. The restaurant is very clean and plays \"makes you want to dance\" Indian music in the background. We will be back. Loved it!"}
{"text":"When we were in Middle East, we loved eating Shawarmas. It came with chopped onion and tomatoes, hummus and tabbouleh.  Here we found a place, called Lazeez, means tasty,   Its a nice shawarma place. Lunch time is usually busy.  The lady and the guy taking orders (I think they are owners) they are courteous but quite stingy in  giving hummus or tabbouleh (popular green salad) which usually comes with a shawarma but they asked us to pay extra.  They should be a bit more generous."}
{"text":"I've always driven by this restaurant but decided to try out their lunch buffet.  The staff was really nice and welcoming.  Upon entering you have a choice to dine in the lunch buffet area or the regular dining room. The food was delicious and my favorite dish was the Chili Chicken.  We were a little bummed they didn't have saag or goat curry as part of the offerings but we were able to order from the menu a la carte.  We also tried the lassi but it came out too icy and watery. Overall, the food was not bad for $12.99 and the service was great."}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to love this place, the food was mediocre at best, and the atmosphere was interesting. I would say that the interior is not cohesive, and did not work too well for the setting.

Looking at the menu, it was definitely a little bit all over the place--there were Indian dishes, Greek dishes, salads, burgers... It was a little overwhelming. I do commend them for having vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. I always think it's important for restaurants to acknowledge these, because there are so many people with allergies and/or dietary restrictions.

Let's get right to the food--I wanted to try their veggie burger, because it was described as a popular Indian street food. This menu item was good! And it was probably my favorite out of everything I had ordered. It was at a good price, and a perfect handheld \"on-the-go\" type of food.

Another dish I tried was their paneer tikka masala, which is my favorite Indian dish, and one that I have ordered at numerous restaurants. Unfortunately, I found theirs to taste very different from the ones I've had and did not enjoy it very much. The samosas were decent! I liked the texture. I also had some naan at this restaurant and those were alright as well.

I've driven by the place numerous times and always think about coming back to try something else, but I just never got around to it and kept finding reasons not to. So, for now, this is it! If you're there, try it out!"}
{"text":"The food here is great I recommend the Chicken Shrawarma  or the Chicken on the rocks. Both are great if you're wondering Chicken on the Rocks is a Chicken Shawarma without the bread on a bed of rice. 
They arent cheap on fillings or sauces. They charge a fair price and I love the option to order a larger Shawarma. 

The place is always busy and that leads to a bit of a wait but its worth it. The staff isnt the friendliest but i can overlook that. Friendly staff is nice but it doesnt make or break a Resturant Im there for food not to make friends. 

Overall I recommend this place and I think they may be one of the best shrawarma places I've found so far. 

I will continue to find great Shrawarma places in Mississauga"}
{"text":"OMG! Terrible service... Poor food preparation. 4 of us ordered 2 salads and 2 sandwiches. The sandwiches came out before the drinks, when the salads finally came out, they came without dressing and we were never able to get waitress to help us. She was too busy watching a soccer game on TV along with the rest of the staff. Then, when I finally went to the counter to ask for me bill, it was wrong. I will NEVER go back, doubtful if I will recommend it to friends or family either. In fact, I will go out of my way to warn people away.."}
{"text":"Great food. Busy at lunch time, long lines but worth the wait. Wish they had more seating areas. Always get their shawarma wrap combo and I love it."}
{"text":"Man,

Food here is off the chain.  Massive portions, amazing value and unbeatable taste.  IMO best chicken on the rocks in the hood glad I revisited.

Damn!"}
{"text":"2.5*  Wait was approx. 15mins. not as long as I thought it would be as it was my first time here.

I'm pretty sure I experienced heartburn within the first few bites.  Lazeez is definitely not for the health conscious as there's soo much sauce, salt, & spice.  Pita pieces in fattoush and fries were at least double-fried, so waaay past golden yellow.  Pita pieces was a minute away from being black!  Dressing in fattoush consisted of just white vinegar and some kinda herb (sumac?).

Is the food edible?  Yes, it's ok.  Are the portions big?  They're alright, DEFINITELY 2-3Xs more rice than anything else.  Meat portions aren't that chunky especially the kebab chunks.

Atmosphere was probably what brings my rating down.  People behind the counter don't seem to care about the food.  No love here!  Each and every table was occupied...with people who were waiting for food.  Only 1 then 2 tables were actually eating.

During my wait, they ran out of rice from the rice cooker, so someone came with a large vat of rice and dumped it into the rice cooker, rice falling all over the counter.  Food was served in styro containers and garbage was almost to the brim in containers.  No recycling whatsoever.

Place is sorta dingy and as per the other reviews, desperately needs some updating or change of light fixtures.  Lighting doesn't really help boost the atmosphere any.

Overall, I was disappointed especially after reading all these overhyped reviews."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Ordered online via Eat 24 and went to go pick it up.  The order was supposed to be ready at 6:45pm and when I arrived they were very unorganized and the order still wasn't ready until 7:15pm. You could hear the staff arguing in the back.
The food was just okay, not great flavor or anything noteworthy not worth the wait honestly. The raita was not good and really runny. 
Would not order from again."}
{"text":"I think this place has a bit of an identity crisis. It's either a fast casual restaurant or its a sit down restaurant. Unfortunately they are charging sit down prices for a fast casual, serve yourself environment. 

The food was decent, but two kabobs dinners and a drink, which you have to get yourself was almost $28.  Wait, now that I think about it, one of the orders was a combo and we never got the onion rings (only choice because they ran out of fries).

For my liking, the music was a bit too loud. I also found the menu to be a little on the big side and pictures, as someone else mentioned would be a huge help.  A mediterranean/Indian place that serves great burgers could probably work, but you may want to advertise them a little more. Maybe a burger with these flavors and toppings could work to. 

Another suggestion, I saw that the owner felt  it necessary to respond. When you do respond in such a way, it comes off as negative and makes you and your restaurant look bad. There is nothing wrong about being passionate, but I would respond a little differently. Something like \"I am sorry your experience with us did not meet your expectations. We will take your feedback as we continually strive to make our restaurant a better dining experience.\"

I'm a fan of small business and I hope this one succeeds, but there are quite a few places in town to get good kabobs and Indian food.  I think once this place figures out exactly who they are, they can succeed."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review for this place for awhile , but oh my gosh I really loved this place :) great great food . I don't recall exactly what we had ordered . It a type of chicken with rice . I feel so bad that I don't remember exactly. The waiter helped us by giving us a recommendation. He was so so nice . I will be back !"}
{"text":"Service was not the best, Ice tea was watered down and chicken was a little too salty. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. Ordered the butter chicken, garlic naan and Nihari. Everything tasted amazing and was exactly the spice level we requested (on this visit, we ordered mild spiciness). Restaurant was also very clean and service was outstanding."}
{"text":"We went with family and ordered a lot of food .. Food was superb and the service as well.. Great place to surely visit and good atmosphere.. Superb clean place.. !! Do visit guys !!"}
{"text":"We got ours to go. The food was salty and nothing special. The goat curry which was a \"must try\" on the menu had three small pieces of goat meat and nothing else. For the price, the portion was also really small. It came with a small styrofoam bowl of jasmine rice. The other two orders were nothing special and overpriced for what we got. There were no napkins or plasticware in the bag either. The service was nonchalant to cold from the two people who helped us. There are better middle eastern places than this."}
{"text":"Back in 2014 i gave them a 5 STAR,  I was hyping this place up they can do no wrong. Oh i was wrong!!!! Oh how the mighty has fallen.

So yeah they opened other locations franchise wise. Yes the franchise's shouldn't be as good as the Original location but somehow the 10th line and Thomas location is doing it right old school wise. Dont go to Argentia i was there the other day ordererd a chicken on the rocks and the chicken was effing cold and the chicken shavings contained tendons and bones a first for me to experience such a thing.

Now back to this location, i came here today for redemption from my experience at the Argentia location.  But once again i was disappointed.  First off i asked the young cashier if they had lentil rice like 2-3 times and his response was him pointing to the containers saying this regular and large sizes WTF moment number 1.

Said eff it get me a chicken on the rocks regular size please.

Next the dude assembling my meal was a young buck too and he was a stingy mofo woth the rice and chicken lile WTF moment 2. Chicken on the rocks - lots of rice buried with chicken and sauce it up. Look at my picture its some rice and chicken and a lil bit of sauce.

I cant recommend this place anymore theyre inconsistent with quality and quantity.  Theyre shell of their former good times.  With that being said their Crown is up for the taking. If somebody can creat that magic they had 3-4 years ago slide my DM. In the mean time theres a lot of other options available around that area. $8 chicken on the rocks is not as a good deal like back in the days. 

I give them 2 stars cause i urge them to go back to their old ways.  For reals Christmas holidays and theyre living that scrooging it up
Yelpers if you know a good substitute holla at me"}
{"text":"One of the new Lazeez franchises that seem to be popping up everywhere.  I have gone to this location at least 5 times given that it's close to my lunch errands around Walmart, Toys R Us, Marshalls and Winners.

I'll give them a 1 Star - since the line ups aren't too long.

My last visit here, I have ordered a Lazeez's on the rocks 2 Go - Received my meal within a reasonable time frame.  i brought the meal to eat in the same parking lot as the location so i can enjoy it with my drink in the car.  Open the meal the usual standard now for on the rocks Rice and chicken barely filling the the half the container cup.  The amount sauce given on the meal wasn't as much.  Upon eating the rice was hot but the chicken was really cold.  i thought maybe it was the sauce on that bite was cold but thru out the whole meal the chicken was consistently cold on each bite.  

Not sure how this happened how do i get served cold chicken??? it was 12:40pm just passed the lunch time crazed you would imagine you would be getting served hot chicken.  couldn't be from the outdoor freezing temperature i only walked 1-2 mins to my car and started eating.

I really hope the ppl that are selling these franchises really go into their restaurants and make sure they're doing their food and customers right.  The owners of these places shouldn't be operating on their own.  With that said i will no longer going be visiting this location for a quick meal pick up.  they're not consistent on their meals.


Other thinks to take note of the place.

- They charge fees when you use your credit card for purchases under $10 - I've paid with my bank card and still got charged the extra fee.  Original location doesn't operate like that.
- when waiting in line to order noticed ppl behind worked at a place and the owner was quite familiar with them.  The owner started to make their meals in advance instead of working on the ppl that just lined up and paid for their meals.I like the Loyalty but that's quite disrespectful for the ppl lining up to order their food now.  FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS should apply.
- I order a wrap that i was planning to eat for dinner and i wanted my sauces on the side so it wouldn't make the wrap soggy during the duration of the day. As the owner was giving my wrap i told him i want my side sauce and he was complaining that i should be paying for extra sauce.  NEWS FLASH know your situation before you swear and complain to your employees on why i should be paying for sauce on the side.  Very disrespectful to talk smack about your customers in front of their faces.

that's my 2 cents on this location. if you're by this location and are hungry i would recommend you go there and give it a shot and see if this location holds up with the original location or not.
Keep Yelping everybody"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and was happy to see there were plenty of customers when I stopped in last night for dinner. I do think they place has some room for improvement, but the food is great!

We ordered the Samosas, Tiki Chicken and a falafal pita sandwhich. My friend and I were very please with the size of the portions and the tasty entrees. 

I feel that I would have enjoyed this place more if... 
-Actual servers waited on you. We were unaware that we needed to grab out drinks and own silverware. For $32.00 + tip I felt slightly annoyed that I had to do my own drink refills and get napkins. 
-The cups were pretty small. I had to refill my soda two times while I was eating. 
-It might be helpful if they had photos of the foods. One of my friends who was not familiar with this type of food was completely unsure on what to order. 

Overall, I probably will be back at some point. The food was tasty. But how often am I honestly going to treat myself to a take out type of meal that is the same price as a sit down place??"}
{"text":"Fiance brought a Groupon for this place. Didn't expect much based on a 3.5 star Yelp review (at the time, 3/7/15) - but we were very impressed. Very generous portions, lean meat (especially the beef), and friendly staff. Great place to get some food to-go. We had the Beef Tikka and Chicken Boti - both tasty.

Décor was nice and modern, though the trash was overflowing. Despite that, we'd come back again to try something else."}
{"text":"If you like Osmows you will like this place. Chicken shawarma taste just like Osmows because if I remember correctly the owners used to work at the streetsville location. It is a tiny bit more expensive at $5.50 but well worth it as I have never felt cramped like at Osmows. Location works for me and there is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Curries were good with right amount of spice. Quite reasonable prices. Good spread of Indian and Mediterranean.

We tried malai kofta, mix veg and paratha. All met or exceeded expectations.

Only flaw is away from strip. But easy parking is a plus"}
{"text":"Love the food here.  It's is delicious and portions are huge. I love the fact there is suitable sitting here so you can actually sit down with the family and eat. Unlike there competitors. *cough* Osmow's *cough*"}
{"text":"Worst location out of the 3 lazeez. Chicken is almost always dried out. Philly cheese is never in Stock. I recommend people just drive 5 mins to the Thomas and tenth line location. Service and quality is ten times better"}
{"text":"Came here with my two buddies based on my friend's recommendation. While there is a decent amount of seating, this place is more of a take out restaurant. It can also get quite busy so you may have to wait a bit in line to get your food but the line moves fast. For the price, the food is amazing and they provide quite big portions. I tried the chicken shawarma and it was great - definitely filling. Be careful with how you hold your container though since they definitely load it up heavy with sauce (learned the hard way). Needless to say I would come back to this place. Summary: Great food, large portion sizes, great price."}
{"text":"The food is not worth the wait. Absolutely disorganized. If this is their dig at the famous halal guys of NYC then they need a huge lesson in what food should taste like. 

I'm very disappointed at the way food tasted after an hour long wait. 

I for sure will not be trying this place in Mississauga again and would advise others to avoid as well."}
{"text":"Food was good but not worth the amount of money I paid for it. I got delivery and the were quick and but the food was small in portion size."}
{"text":"Food is good but it is VERY pricey. If you order a burger its 5.99 and fries would be 3 bucks on top of that. I just bought my burger and went across the street to mcdonalds and picked up the dollar fries. Besides the price, the food is just ok. In no way shape or form is it worth 11 and 13, which is their general price range. If you go for kabobs you are talking very small quantities for nothing less than 12 and anything decent costing an easy 16. Also every little chutney, sauce or dip is going to cost you between 2- 3 dollars. Pros: Nice and Clean
Cons: EXPENSIVE, Small quantities.
 
Final comment: I only come here when I dont want to go too far for halal. But Vegas is pretty small so I just drive most of the times :)"}
{"text":"Rice was dry, Nigari, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Chicken Makhani all have the spices but smell and taste like soy sauce....can't imagine how much soy sauce you need to use in order to cover up the aroma of Indian spices. Nigari was very salty, but not as bad as the Paneer Saag. It was so salty, bitter, and fiborus (should be creamy, right?) so it was simply inedible. Chicken Tikka tasted OK, but it was the size of two cornish hen legs. Garlic Naan, not garlicky.Worst Indian food I ever had....Not impressed!"}

{"text":"I ordered a pick up order for my lunch break and when I got back to work to eat my lunch there were several things wrong with it.

1. I ordered a kebab chicken and beef, I received just chicken. No beef at all. 

2. The sauce that came with the food was watered down. I can barely taste what it's supposed to be. 

3. I didn't receive a fork or any kind of utensil, and napkins. It's just the food inside the paper bag.


I would understand if the place was busy but I came in and it was empty. How can you get an order wrong and forget to provide utensils for a to-go order? What a waste of money. I should've paid $5 less cos I only received half of my order. Smh."}
{"text":"The food is OK, I used to be a regular and for whatever reason it's gone downhill. The behari kabab used to be succulent and juicy but they were extremely dry the last 2 times I've gotten them. My previous review was 5 stars because the food used to be of very high quality but they aren't even getting my order (which has never changed) right anymore. My old post is proof that I don't only post negative reviews and that I've been loyal.

On that note, the service has gotten really ridiculous. The wait times are astonishing and the staff is incredibly rude. I've gone to lazeez 20 some times and have ordered all my dishes a la carte. This time around, I called to place my regular order and the girl on the phone told me they don't do the curries a la carte. I replied that that's odd because I've both ordered out and dined in there several times and I've always gotten it a la carte with no issues. She had a very rude tone and basically snapped at me, saying that if I got it that one time (even though I specifically told her I've gotten it several times) it was probably out of the kindness of the owner's heart. I have gotten it this way SEVERAL times and my order has been taken by multiple people. She was extremely condescending.  Furthermore, last visit my mom commented that the raita seeming like less than before and the lady was ridiculously defensive, my mom didn't even use a rude tone, simply surprised. When you pay for raita you want to get a decent amount. So much for the customer always being right."}

I had the chicken makhani at a 6 spicy and it was just right but next time I will do an 8 because I love spicy . the chicken tandoori was perfect nice and tender and you can taste the lemon  which I enjoyed.

{"text":"Landed here for dinner while on travel with a couple of co-workers and had a great meal. 

Tried their chicken boti, Bihari kabob and sheek kabob and all three were good... Flavorful meat, well cooked and juicy. 

The staff was very courteous and decor is good. They called a cab for us and we're very helpful. I'm going back here when I'm in town next. 

Strongly encourage to try this place out when in mood for Indian, Mediterranean or halal food... You just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Really loved the atmosphere of Lazeez! The service was great. The waitress was extremely helpful. It is a great place to get a quick bite. The portion size is larger. I was surprised when they brought the food out in to go boxes, but it made it so much easier to take home! Food was still delicious the next day. I've had such a hard time finding a place with good Chicken Tikka and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, hate the lineups. Fix your system or make another Mississauga location!!! Eating in is also very informal and casual, I mostly do take out here."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience. Would recommend anyone visiting Las Vegas to try this Indian Restaurent"}
{"text":"Eat here fairly regularly, on average once a week. The chicken on the rocks and the philly cheese steak are always a great choice. Pricing is in keeping with what you'd expect from a shawarma joint, and the food has been consistently tasty every time I've been there. 

On the downside however because it's become so popular the wait can be a bit on the long side (sometimes approaching or exceeding 10 minutes) but that would be about the only complaint and in truth not a big issue at all. It seems to be mostly takeout although dining in would be fine as well I suppose. 

Very similar in menu and taste to Osmow's - was told the owner was a partner at Osmow's before (no idea if that's true or not)

The secret is in the consistent quality and freshness of the food (they're busy with a high turnover so you know the food is fresh and tastes that way) the sauces are also good but be mindful if you order something spicy if you're not prepared for it!

Great place and will continue to be a regular customer"}
{"text":"We had gyro, steak, chicken plates and all were excellent. Rice was delicious. Dressing for the salad also were great. Usually Greek good tends to be too sour for me, cause of lemon used. Their food had just right amount of lemon and olive oil."}
{"text":"Back then, lazeez on the rocks was drenched with all the sauces. It was amazing coz every rice bits was sauced!!!

Lately, sauce is just enough to get u a taste but thats what Osmows is for... im going to lazeez coz of the sauce and the chicken. 

I tried asking for more sauce and the lady just dropped the \"you have to pay extra\", no one wants to hear that!

Hot sauce was free back then too and now its EXTRA! 

Give us back the same service we had when it first started dont be like osmows!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place blew our minds!!! Came in just to try it out since we saw a vegan options sign in the window. Michell was our sever, she could tell we were not super familiar with the food and sweetly guided us with a few option recommendations.

She recommended we try the mixed veggie curry made vegan style. We also ordered veggie samosas and hummus. Everything that we tried was over the top amazing. My husband is not normally a curry fan and I had to fight him for every bite. We devoured everything. Can't wait to come back for more delicious food and wonderful service from Michelle. She defiantly made our experience memorable and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Had their lazeez half and half. Nice fresh ingredients, good portion size and delicious. Would highly recommend this place. They have great service. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean places in all of Mississauga. You have to try the Chicken on the rocks - it's the classic that everyone gets. I personally ask for half and half (rice and fries) and love it. The large is a crazy amount of food so only get it if you're really hungry.

There's almost always a line, but it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Learning that On the Rocks is their best seller, we order with Beef shawarma.
However, we were not impressed at all. The meat was not sliced as thin as thin expected, that is why it was not cooked well enough either. Our plates were filled with lots of rice that is more than enough for a person. The rice tastes just plain, not impressive at all. I had to throw half of the rice that made me just sorry.

As far their famous white sauce, I was not impressed either. 

Despite of their just regular food, I am amazed to see the never ending line. People keep coming, probably just because they cannot find a better place offering the same food.


An area with great opportunity for competition.

By the way, their prices are quite reasonable for the amount of food you get.
I did not say drinks, did I?"}
{"text":"Wow! I ordered the chicken boti and it was so delicious! I had planned on taking my food home but wanted to try a quick bite when I got into the car... well, I ate the whole thing in the parking lot (I'm not proud). It was so tasty! My birthday is next week and now I know where my husband will be taking me for dinner :)"}

I came here with my family for a late lunch. We were the only customers here. One young lady was serving us and did a decent job. She made sure she greeted us, promptly sat us down and took our drink order. She needed a reminder to refill our empty drinks but hey that happens. 

Anyways back to the food; it was like anticipating a Coca Cola but getting a flat store brand soda. That's the best analogy at the moment. You can't offer Indian and Mediterranean food and have it lack flavor. Of course I order the chicken tikka masala and it was almost like I could've made it better. Mind you, I hardly cook. I am willing to give it another shot dothe road since I do know they recently opened and I know this specific spot had had multiple unsuccessful restaurant. This restaurant could have a lot of potential. They could start by add serving their chicken bryani and chicken tikka masala with a serving spoon. It was a family size portion. We had to use the same forks and spoons from our meal. Also, I order a Tzatziki on the side because the waitress informed me it didn't come with the sampler. Of course it did though, as stated on the menu. So we had two but I mean the more Tzatziki the better but that's not the point. Regardless we paid $110 for our late lunch. It was nice to try but I would need my fellow yelpers to keep me updated before I ever stop by again. I'll definitely try the \"Mediterranean\" side of the menu. 

I asked my family what they rated their meal so check out the pictures! 

1st star for serving Halal
2nd star for the over tasty Chicken Tikka Tandoori
3rd star cleanliness and average service"}
{"text":"I am sad to say the falafel sandwich and accompanying sauces were tasteless. 

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Hey yelpers this place is outstanding. If you are halal grubbers check out review on Zabihah. For all others this place is so good. If you like grilled meats and curry or gyros check this place out. Clean and modern. Bathrooms clean. Food fresh and delicious. Order spice 10 for spicey flavor. We tried 8 first time but quite hot enough for our palate. We also asked for a side of fresh raw chili and onions which complemented our meal. We tried aloo saag, chicken curry, nihari, chicken gyro, tandoori roti and paratha. All fabulous. One suggestion to owners is to add lamb gosht and a beef curry would be fabulous. We look forward to visiting our next trip. Oh and the prices are good deal for quantity of food and taste."}
{"text":"Location, decor, theme, service, and menu are all strange. Not necessarily bad, just odd. Pleasantly surprised that the Indian food was actually very good. Had samosas, veggie korma and chicken saag. They also have grilled cheese and stuff for the kids which my kids liked. Will go again."}
{"text":"I got the chicken  boti mild  and it was flavorful and moist.  My husband got the chili chicken spicy and his was a  Equivalent to a Thai 5 but very good.   It also had some crunchy vegetables.    We give the food a 5 but  The bathroom was a 4 though since the floor was dirty."}
{"text":"Came for the newly introduced lunch buffet. Not at all happy with the selection and quality of the food.  Was a tad pricier than most for a less than satisfying meal.

If I return, it will be to order off the menu."}
{"text":"Good place, good shawarma, cheap price. 
fast order processing, but can get busy at lunch."}
{"text":"Bad. Had to return the food for a refund. First time in my life. Then she said to me \"I don't like you anyway\" 

Won't be back. Don't go."}
{"text":"SOO good!!! My favorite cuisine would probably be Indian food so I've tried a lot of places (mostly in California since that's where I'm from) and know the difference between good and bad Indian food.. this was definitely GOOD! Great actually. Only thing is I ordered a few sides of Raita and got the wrong kind but it wasn't their fault.. I didn't realized they have 2 different kinds of raita so if you're like me and love that stuff, make sure you get the right one! Again, not their fault. I ordered delivery and it came in the time they said it would so points for that also! I'll definitely be ordering again :)"}
{"text":"I ususally go to Osmows but my friend was ranting and raving about the garlic sauce at Lazeez. I am a huge fan of garlic (and onions mmmhmm give me a kiss!) so I had to try it. It was definitely worth the trip. There was a line full of ethnic people, so that was a clear indication that the food was good and authentic. The meat was moist, the salad was fresh and the fries were crispy. The portion was more then enough, we all had left overs. I don't have any complaints in regards to food, I will be back when I am in the area. The previous reviewers are right I did wait about 15 minutes for my food, the service wasn't bubbly or engaging and they could spruce the place up a bit. I don't mind waiting for my food especially when you see them individually dressing each salad and cutting meat for every order.  This isn't Ruth Chris Steakhouse so don't go in expecting a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I feel bad writing a negative review because this place and the staff were so nice. It's beautifully decorated inside. When you go in, you go up to the counter and order your food. The owner even helped me decide what I wanted to order. Yet, when the food came out, it was a huge disappointment. This is Mediterranean food fused with Indian food. There was nothing special about the food at all!!!!

Maybe this kind of fusion is not for me."}
{"text":"Decided to head over to Lazeez on my lunch break one day after reading these reviews.  Decided to try the Lazeez on the rocks with half rice half fries as mentioned by a previous poster.  So glad I did, was definitely filling, mountains of chicken on top, lots of sauce and I loved the variety of rice and fries.  Would definitely go back again (on a cheat day lol)"}
{"text":"Lola has been my server the last two times and she is lovely. Tonight we ordered the butter chicken and it was much hotter than we expected. When we asked her about it, it was clear it was not her mistake as we saw her write down the proper order. She got our order fixed and we loved the food and great service. Thanks Lola!!"}
{"text":"We love Lazeez! We go there to eat or have food delivered from there at least once a week. The Chana chat is the best in town & the Veggie Korma is delicious. 

When you go, don't forget the garlic naan!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for Indian food!!! Try it you'll love it! Best lamb gyro in a long time!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and we really appreciated there being kid friendly options here!! Good find!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times for lunch. First off, the food is awesome. It tastes fresh, and is beautifully seasoned. There is usually a line, especially around lunch time. However, both times I went, there were huge delays in getting my food. I waited on average 15-20 min for my food to be prepped. If the food was made in a quick period of time, I'd be giving 5 stars"}
{"text":"HALAL

I heard a lot about this place so I decided to give it a try. Very busy place. If you have been to Osmow's then this is very similar to that. They have their special which is exactly what Osmow's calls \"chicken on the rocks.\" The flavor of the food is good but nothing great. Their shawarma is ok but not authentic tasting. Chicken does not have the full flavor that you would expect, They base their taste on the sauces they use. 

There is no use in calling ahead and placing an order. When you go in, you will still have to wait in the long lineup and when you get to the register to pay, that's when they will place your order. So then I ask, what is the point of calling ahead and accepting my order? Seriously!!!!

Nothing special. Unless you like that kind of taste."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food!!! Best shawarmas in town with the best sauce. You guys really need to try this!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  The place has an odd set up, with self service drinks in the front and having to go around to the back to place an order.  Wish the pita bread was softer, but it was still good.  Eyes were bigger than the stomach, we brought most of our Meal home after filling up on the appetizer platter.  But I have to sy that was the best falafel I have ever had.  It was smooth, not dry.  We finished them all off.  The lamb was so tender, they must have cooked it on low for days!  The leftovers the next day were so good,my husband mentioned that we have to go back.  Now that is a complement."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean & quasi-Indian food in the Valley!!!

Had the veggie burger(bunkabob). Worth a double order!!  The Paneer saag is the best i have ever eaten.

Do yourself a favor....order the falafel wrap & lazeez power salad. You will leave healthy, happy & FULL!!!"}
{"text":"Every since December the owner has become really stingy. Including the workers. They have substantially decreased the amount of chicken that is put on the rocks. (Plus have now increased the prices).The chicken has become rougher and salty. As before it was tender and flavourful when mixed with the sauces. 

Further, the owner has the dexterity to question my authority to ask for more chicken. He answers comes grumpily that no one asks for more chicken. Well no one has the will to ask unlike me when their on the rocks is being made. (I recommend that you all do the same). If they put small amount of chicken on your rocks just tell them straight that they should put more. You are paying for the chicken not the ice. 

As a reminder to all this place has fallen down as it has become a franchise. They are trying to reduce as much cost to themselves cause they have made a name now. Just to remind them folks you made it possible for their success. If they don't treat you right remember how we left Osmows we can leave them as well. 

Stay strong and fight for the good count for the rocks is calling!"}
{"text":"Winter Blues? Back to mundane routine and life after the Christmas season? Post-breakup hunger indulgences? This is THE place to turn that frown upside down!!! This has  become my Barakat (Yelp London review) close to home. The sauces are sinful but ohhh so good! The meats are seasoned perfectly. The prices are cheap and food aplenty! We've tried pretty much everything on their menu and to date have never been disappointed. As with most other smaller establishments that are this good, be prepared for a line-up (usually to the door), an efficiently run chain of commands to get you your order and out the door (fast but not overly friendly)....they are on a Mission no matter what day or time! Although you may not necessarily always get a smile or friendly chitchat session, you'd best believe the food will make you way happy (ier) than they ever could :D"}
{"text":"I had previously raved about how 'Wrap-a-bite' is my favourite shawarma place in Mississauaga, but oh was I wrong once I tried the shawarma at Lazeez. 
Upon entering I noticed that it's really popular, as people kept coming in non-stop and creating a long line. What I appreciated was that they created an organized system whereby you place your order and make your choices on the toppings, sauces, and spice levels according to the options on a list right by the area where you place your order and pay altogether.
Then you wait until they call out your name. I got my chicken shawarma (after around 5-7 minutes of waiting) with all the toppings and asked for it to be hot. All I can say is that the first bite ruined every single previous shawarma experience I've had in the past.
I now get dreams of this place."}
{"text":"They've made a name in Mississauga for making one of the best shawarmas and chicken on the rocks in town. It's nice that they have several restaurants across the city without sacrificing their menu items like a lot of chain restaurants had.

This place looks a bit old and seems like it needed some upgrades or renovations inside. Don't be mistaken by the looks however because their food makes up for it! I ordered a Lazeez on the rocks with a large shawarma. He shawarma was LARGE and was packed with a nice assortment of toppings (i.e. onions, pickles, turnips, olives, lettuce, tomato). The chicken on the rocks had a generous portion of chicken and was loaded with their delicious sauce on top. Seriously, you need to try their sauce! I absolutely love chicken on the rocks and I think this is probably the best place to get it if you're also a fan."}
{"text":"My husband and I are always on lookout for good  food. We happened to be in Vegas and this place looked promising in terms of reviews and the menu variety that they offered so I made it a point to make a stop here and I think that was a GREAT decision. The food was probably the best I have had in North America so far! I like my desi food to be authentic and this place did a great job with that. We ordered chicken biryani and beef bihari platter and the taste was superb. Everything was cooked to perfection and had a genuine Pakistani taste. The owner personally took our order and ensured that the spice level is tailored to our preference. The paratha and the garlic naan was freshly baked and made a great combination with the beef bihari. The portion size was great for the price as well. Highly recommended. Really wish we had something similar in east coast. Can totally take a trip to Vegas to just eat here!"}
{"text":"Good shawarma good price. You can get a HUGE chicken shawarma for only 5 dollars, and the spicy sauce creamy sauce made it just perfect for a fast food"}
{"text":"My buddy recommended this place a couple months back and figured I would give it a try. Im usually an Osmows guy but Im very glad I tried this place.

Their shawarma is bar none some of the best I've ever had. The sauce tastes great, their rice isn't greasy, and their chicken portion is very generous!!

Absolutely love their chicken on the rocks. I would give 5/5 stars but their service tends to be somewhat slow. I've had to wait 10, sometimes 15 minutes for a single order. And a couple times I've been there they have run out of menu items like Tabouli. However none of that matters because their chicken on the rocks is what I come for.

Seriously some kick-ass Shawarma. Keep killing it Lazeez!"}
{"text":"pros:
great prices. different daily special every day
fresh ingredients and meat
best tasting chicken shawarma meat in sauga

cons:
place is not ideal for a date as it is a tad unclean and seats are worn out 
due to the lineups, it is quite a wait to get your shawarma
high turnover- staff usually are new and dont understand all the menu items"}
{"text":"Lamb and beef are the same so dont bother asking for any of em specifically 
The manager one of the worst people I've ever met 
Food is 3/10 staff members really nice
Dont go there with ur family if u respect them cz the chefs are perverts
If u want a good Indian authentic restaurant i would recommend kabob n more on the strip next to wynn casino
The prices are way beyond what they are actually worth"}
{"text":"We went in thinking the chicken on the rocks will be similar to osmow's; chicken, rice and soupy sauce. Nope! Sauce is not soupy so it was a nice change and the lentil rice was really tasty. The chicken could have been fresher but overall large chicken on the rocks was filling for the two of us! (Or one if you eat more) 
I'd come back."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and kind, attentive employees. The samosas were fresh, crispy and flavorful. The curry was not so delicious--it tasted old and watery. I was comp'd rice for the trouble. Decent selection for vegetarians. Price seemed a little high, but worth it for a first time visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this place one day when we went next door for lunch. We love Indian food so decided right away that we'd be back to try it out. And we are so happy we did! This place is quality food in a take out/fast food style. You order with the cashier and pay. Then the food is delivered to your table in disposable containers. When you're done, you throw away your trash and out your tray away. Easy peezy. 

We ordered a chicken tikka masala (of course.. our main go-to for Indian). But instead if ordering one each, we shared it and also ordered a Paneer chili and garlic naan. The paneer chili was good, with onions and peppers, but I'm sorry, the tikka masala just can't be beat. Esp with the garlic naan to compliment it! 

The prices are more than fair. Only downfall is their service is a bit slow. I remember thinking we waited a long time for our food. Which I don't mind if I'm not in a hurry. Since that first time, we have also ordered it again about 3 days later for take out. And now that I've talked about it, I kind if feel like it again.. Maybe for tonight!

Go try it for yourself. I loved it.."}
{"text":"Food was ok but very nothing special.  The kabob plate is kind of a mess.  Salad with no dressing, tandoori chicken, pita bread and rice.  It just didn't work.   The hummus was the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"The food here was incredible. After mooching off of my friends Curry dish at a sushi place, I had ridiculous craving for Curry. This place certainly didn't disappoint when it came to that. In fact it's probably the best Mediterranean food I've ever had. Having said that, be cautious when asking for a spicy dish. You will get a whoopin. Our server Natalie was also amazing to top it off. I'll definitely be back here again soon."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic, the servers were super nice.  
The inside is beautiful and clean. 

The food was delicious!!!  We got the chicken kabobs and the veggie pakora.  I seriously have the best taste left in my mouth."}
{"text":"2nd time here and we Love love love the food we got. We had a chicken Chile, the

Ok so I had an unpublished draft that I need to finish. 

This restaurant is my favorite for a quick go to Indian bite and if my kid isn't down for Indian they have some goodies for her too. 

So options are great here but the flavors and the foods they give are delish. The staff I love them. I love talking to this one waiter about Bollywood films and actors.  

That being said the atmosphere, the pricing it's all great for me. They were closed tonight so I went else where to Mint Indian and I was so disappointed after being used to the flavors of this place. 

Great food.  Great staff. Great selection. I wish more people ate here because after reading reviews of other places I'm a bit baffled.  Even my Indian friends don't understand why Lazeez
Doesn't have more of a following ... you gotta try this place. I do recommend it. 


They do not over cook their meats so when I do want to have a flesh of an animal it's nice to not have to fight the dead meat just chew it."}
{"text":"Family style Indian food which has great food but needs to a little polish on the service.  The Mediterranean food is also tasty.  I enjoyed the spinach saag, naan bread, chicken tikka marsala and the appetizers with some green tea with honey.  Traditional Indian recipes are given a flavorable spin.  Spice scale of 4-10 so bring your appetite.  Generous portions."}
{"text":"This place is consistent! I got the chicken masala and last time the vindo, if you are looking for true Indian dishes go to this place! Also lots of vegan options as well :)"}
{"text":"I found hair in my food before and the place is unsanitary the few times I've been there."}
{"text":"Having gotten food a few times since the terrible dinner experience (for which the owner inexplicably contended that I simply didn't know the cuisine), I was ready to bump the review up, because subsequent meals were a return to being solid.

And then I went for lunch today, and waited for ten minutes while servers did everything except seat me for a meal. Seriously, leaving someone waiting for ten minutes? Greeting a customer who came in 8 minutes after me before me? Yeah, well here is your one star, which is one more than you deserve because my experience today was the literal absence of service."}
{"text":"Nice airy, open, modern, yet comfortable environment and decor. 
The staff are very professional, polite, and prompt.
The dining experience overall: Fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok for me. The service was good, but the food was just okay. The hummus was super bland, which was disappointing. The restaurant itself didn't seem super clean either. Not sure if I would come back, maybe I would give it one more try. The meals my friends got looked amazing, the rice was good, and cooked perfectly, so it's worth another shot."}
{"text":"So here's the thing. I actually come here quite regularly. Food is very good but service is just as important. If you order a dish, they will ask you how spicy you'd like it - mild, medium or hot. No charge for choosing more and no discount for choosing less. 

Today I chose medium but when I opened the box it was less than I had wanted. No issues I thought so I sent my son to get some extra hot sauce from the guys. They said he needed to pay an extra 50 cents so he came back. I then went back because I was surprised. The person behind the counter confirmed the same. I said you guys don't charge for sauce upfront and if the customer wants a bit more, what's the issue. She understood but said it was a \"management decision\". Odd to be nickel and diming customers like this.

Recommendation: management (owner) should listen to the guys behind the counter. They're great and know their customers - solicit their inputs before rolling out these odd nickel and diming policies."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.

Second time getting food here. 1st time was a Gyro and fries and it was great.

This time Chicken Tikki Marsala with Garlic Naan and Baklava. 

They have a nice setup inside, very nice. The girl that helped was was nice. This is definitely my go to spot. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is not a shawarma at all its just sauce on rice and the beef meat was cold i don't recommend this place for anyone"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Will need to come back here again- everything looked so good.  I wanted to order the whole left side of the menu!"}
{"text":"We were visiting a cousin who moved to Las vegas recently and had time for a quick dinner before our flight. He took us to this place. I walked in with zero expectations, what can one expect from an Indian place tucked away in a quiet Las Vegas suburb? Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised. This is not your quintessential Indian restaurant, it serves Indian/Mediterranean food, so you expect some kind of fusion food. I was suffering from an upset tummy that day and so decided to play it safe and ordered the dal soup with some rice. The dal and rice combination was so uplifting that I started feeling better almost instantly. I started trying other dishes that our group ordered including the chicken biryani. It is not an authentic biryani from any angle but tasted amazing. We also tried the sheekh kebab, boti kebab and palak chicken. Every dish was great and looked as if it was crafted with great care. The service was slow though the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"My first dining experience here was absolutely fantastic! The customer service was fairly well, and the food was nothing short of delicious. If you plan on dining I recommend the chicken panini sandwich. Besides the food, they have the most enjoyable atmosphere yet. It was very zen. They also have very decent prices for full portioned meals. If you are looking for a place with lots a flavors and spice; Lazeez is the place to be! Living up to the expectations of their motto \"Fresh, Healthy, Tasty, Halal\""}
{"text":"Poor!! Poor!!!  Very bad indian. Chix tikka masala was perfectly diced cubes of chix. Not chunks of chix in a wood fire clay oven. Falafel was dry. Tsaki was very watery n no flavor. And on top of it the amount of rice they give u wasnt enough for a baby. Delivery was $6 r u kidding.  Redic!!!  Not tasty. Bland. Learn how to cook!!!"}
{"text":"Lazeez was such a surprise hit! We were in the area and craving Indian food (as is the case with me like 90% of the time) and decided to check this place out. HOLY CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA BATMAN! It was SO good! We ordered the saag chicken and the Bihari kabob roll. Both were excellent. The best part was the saag chicken came with parantha. You need to understand that growing up, getting parantha was a big deal. It was usually only on Sunday morning and mom fed you parantha and then you didn't eat again until dinner. Yes, it's heavy, but it's heavenly too. The ones we got were yummy and flaky and brought back so much nostalgia for me. The serving portions were huge and we had plenty to take home. It was just as yummy the next day reheated. Lazeez (the Indian food part of it) is definitely authentic and maybe not the best for new palates to Indian food. This is definitely for people who LOVE them some Indian food. The dishes are not generic \"Indian restaurant\" food and not for the faint of heart. The weekend lunch buffet is back as well. It's until 3PM on the weekends. I will 100% be frequenting it. If you see me in line, say hi. I apologize now for having food in my mouth when I wave back!"}
{"text":"Very good food. We came in for the buffet. There was Verity of food. Thier service was good too! I would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Mehhhh, decent but not memorable. Definitely confused with the place, the food, the interior, what is it? Indian Chicken and paneer were decent but exp dishes like any other restaurant. Would like to try the wraps and the med options next time..."}
{"text":"I've just tried this place last week and I've loved it so much that I had dinner twice from there last week. Pricing, quantity as well as quality is good. Hope it stays like that."}
