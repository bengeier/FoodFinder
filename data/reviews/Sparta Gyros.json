{"text":"Great gyros, nice authentic Greek menu and really reasonable prices. No delivery though."}
{"text":"Awful, may have used an entire bottle of white greek sauce on my chicken gyro.  Good luck tasting the meat, or finding it for that matter."}
{"text":"Good gyros, clean place, reasonable prices and friendly staff. Every time I go I get the Spartan Gyro- love the fries and feta cheese on it. Took our food to go today but there are plenty of tables available at lunch time."}
{"text":"Sparta is one of my favorite gyros in Pittsburgh.  The inside is always very clean and the service is fast and friendly.

I always go with the standard gyro and fries.  I also make sure to get an extra side of tzatziki because it is so good here.  It has a little different flavor than other gyro places, but works perfect.  The meat is fresh and hot and the pitas are delicious as well.  Their fries appear to be fresh cut fries and are a perfect side."}
