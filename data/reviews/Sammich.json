{"text":"Great, friendly service and a very tasty kubideh. I will be back to try out all the other options."}
{"text":"Two words: Hello Portobello. It's my favourite thing on the menu and I would highly recommend it! The sammich filling was flavourful and very generous with respect to the filling to bread ratio. The combination of veggies with the sauce just works so well! My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday evening and he got the Lemongrass Pork sammich which was also delicious. I like how they offer a variety of \"sammich\" options from italian to korean to vietnamese to persian to american. They also have a salad bar which I plan on trying out on my next visit. \"sammiches\" are a universal staple, who wouldn't be satisfied?!"}
{"text":"Wow cannot say enough good this things about the sandwiches. I had the \"I got Seoul\" sandwich.. best. thing. ever. So happy this is in the area now. A must try."}
{"text":"Not a traditional sandwich shop. They have a unique mix of options. We tried the Marciano (Italian) and Kirkland (roast beef). Both we excellent! Workers were super nice as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm torn. More like a 4.5 - it was delicious.  Here's the caveat - their menu says that the first two options are a bun or wrap. I assumed that meant the others are bun-based (after all, \"sammich!\") but alas it came in a wrap.  So - I had the Cluckin' Good. Was it really yummy? Yup. But as a warp, it just was not as appetizing (and again, the name is sammich).  I was really looking forward to trying to cheese steak option, but as a wrap? Boo."}

{"text":"Yummy yummy! Very good value, generous portions. The portobello sandwich is my favourite. Also try the daily soup! So good!! So far I've tried a beef and barley soup, a lentil and vegetable one, a chickpea one and a chicken one- all very tasty and filling. A lovely addition to the area."}
{"text":"Ordered the Diaz.  It's one of the bigger veggie sandwiches I've had at a sandwich shop. Full of pickled veggies and roasted cauliflower.  Shop per manager will be expanding soon to sell more produce and speciality good items.  Manager and server nice."}
{"text":"The Marciano was delicious. Everything was so fresh and made to order. Very cool concept and I expect to be a regular here. Great service and vibe from the staff. Another winner on 185th."}
{"text":"Went there for the first today for lunch today.  Food: I ordered CLUCKIN' GOOD WRAP for $8.50 plus tax.  The chicken was skewer pieces that seemed to be just grilled.  The taste was really good, however a bit on the smaller side.  For the price it a worthy investment.    Service (5 stars):  The restaurant seems to be family run, and everyone was very friendly.   Note that the food is made from scratch so it takes some time for it to be ready.  I would suggest using the online pickup option to save itme.   Ambiance (4 stars):  This was previously Chelo, and the place has not changed much (lookwise)  They did insert 2 flat screens on which they show the menu.   There are a handful of bar stools and a small table, but would not recommend eating there.  It is almost a kiosk.  Would recommend this place for takeout lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Jack Flaps and now am of Sammich as well. Great for the area and great food as well. I got the Lewis and can't wait to go back to try another"}
{"text":"A hidden gem on Queen St.. a fantastic family run business. My \"sammich\" is always freshly made and portions are astoundingly generous. Each \"sammich\" takes a unique spin on a cultural dish, and although not a huge selection, every single sandwhich I've tried has been amazing.  Highly recommended!"}
