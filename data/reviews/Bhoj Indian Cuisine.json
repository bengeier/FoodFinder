{"text":"Ordered take out last week, and it was amazing! As we were waiting we were treated to a nice little appetizer, and the service was quick and friendly! Really enjoyed the meal we had, particularly the samosas!"}
{"text":"Our favourite new Indian delivery spot...rich curries, tasty samosas, and fresh doughy naan!"}
{"text":"Me and wife were looking for something different food in Indian cuisine. Have eaten at number of places n wanted a change. In yelp came through this new restaurant with good reviews. It a small n cozy restaurant with authentic Indian ambience. People were very friendly. Service was great. We ordered goat curry n dhaba chicken Indian street style with kulcha n aaloo paratha. Should say the food was just amazing specially the goat curry. Spices was as if we were eating in India. Also we ordered jeera rice by the side n should say rice was also perfectly done. Great experience n would recommend all to try out this restaurant as it will remind you of eating at home."}
{"text":"Ordered the butter chicken and garlic naan for take-out last week. They said it would take a bit of time as all their meals are made to order. I didn't mind the wait as long as the food tasted good. As many have mentioned, the garlic naan was delicious. Very soft and and chewy, full of garlic flavour. It was perfect for dipping in the butter chicken sauce. The sauce was not up to my expectation but it was good enough, especially with the naan. 

However, the chicken they used in the butter chicken had some kind of unpleasant odour,  the second I bit into it I had to spit it out. I tried another piece of chicken and it tasted more yucky! I have never tasted any meat like that. It was so disgusting that I haven't been able to eat any chicken since then. 

Would love to give this place another chance and have their naan again, but I am still afraid to go back. Still traumatized by the whole experience and I actually regret writing this review because now I can actually taste that darn chicken in my mouth again!!"}
{"text":"One of the restaurants with unique appetizers which are so delicious to taste, spinach cheese kebab is really good, their in house sauce which they serve with their tikka's is amazing. Well i tried their vegetarian only and their platter is good, food is fresh and over all portions are good. Highly recommended and i am going to visit again."}
{"text":"It's really close to Toronto Library and workers are really kind! Taste and price were both satisfying"}
{"text":"We were drawn into this cozy unpretentious restaurant quite accidentally.
We were out for a walk one evening and an incredible fragrance peaked our interest 
and our appetite,
We were surprised and pleased to discover that the food both in quality and taste didn't disappoint.
It was fresh and unique and the best Indian  food that we've tasted in a very very long time.

The attention to detail was exemplary. Our server was warm helpful and enthusiastic.

I don't usually write reviews but I want to let others know about Bhoja so that it doesn't remain a secret.
Do yourself a favour and give it a try."}
{"text":"I am posting this review after ordering take-out from Bhoj Indian Cuisine over a dozen times. Since my hubs & I moved nearby, we have ordered from here weekly (in fact, we JUST finished our latest take-out meal). We've never eaten IN the restaurant.

PROS:

- Hubby & I both agree that this is the BEST Indian food we've had in the gta. Delicious! I'm sure there are other gems out there, but this is definitely our gem.
- Food is ready in 20-30 minutes; it is hot (temperature), fresh, & seasoned very well.
- Spiciness can be adjusted to your taste. Just ask.
- Decent portions.
- Recommendations - garlic naan (sooo good, eat it hot!), dal maharani (lentils in cream sauce), samosas, butter chucken, jeera rice.
- Less than a 10 minute walk from Bloor/Yonge subway or Bay subway station.

CONS:

- Price is moderate (but worth it, in my opinion!) and comparable to other Indian restaurants I have been to.
- Limited parking options, but paid street parking is available & nearby Green P.

Overall, I feel incredibly lucky that this gem is so closeby. I will be back... next week! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Always fresh. Highly recommended. Tried all the vege dishes - fantastic. Beef bhuna is usually great if chef does not over cook the meat. I am a happy return customer and love the staff - so helpful and friendly, even for delivery orders. So good."}
{"text":"We came for lunch/dinner based on other Yelp reviews. The restaurant is fairly new, small and midtown. I am sure by the summer reservations will be a must! Everything was fresh, flavourful and rich in taste. It has been a long time since I have been able to rave about an Indian restaurant. The service was excellent and the chef came out to introduce himself. We mentioned enjoying a whole fish prepared in the tandoori and he quickly told us to call a day ahead and he would have a fish to prepare for us. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Veggie appetizers on point, specialty butter chicken is the best I've had in Toronto, highly recommend"}
{"text":"Average at best food at ridiculous prices. I ordered the chef special butter chicken with white rice, the portions are small - a bowl of sauce with a few pieces of chicken. The flavours were very average, nothing to rave about. The most frustrating thing is that a $16 main dish does not even come with rice, and I only found out when I got the bill, they charged me $5 for rice. For a meal that costed $30 after tax and tips, I essentially had a bowl of sauce on white rice. Simply despicable. Never again."}
{"text":"Had the chicken tikka masala, it was really good however the naan breads were superb!! Def recommend :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! We had the bhel and bhoj salad to start - both portions were larger than we expected and yummy! The bhel was flavorful and had a fresh crisp texture. The salad was a tiny bit dry but had good flavor. For the main dishes we had the palak paneer and the hariyali chicken. The chicken was super tender and had the perfect flavor, and the palak paneer was creamy and satisfying. I actually think it was the best I've had yet, hahah. The atmosphere of this restaurant is relaxed but upscale. Our waiter was very kind and we could tell they really try to make the dining experience as pleasant as possible. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was a planned visit as I was going to be in the area. I have been exploring the spots in this locality lately so a recommendation from two friends moved this spot up the ladder. 
The place is cozy for starters and the interior is to the point. They do take reservations though  on the day we went it seemed like the evenings are geared towards take out.
The menu is well laid out IMO with section dedicated to appetizers, vegetarian dishes, curries, grilled items and desserts.
My DCs who had been here before recommended the Bhoj special butter chicken (I kind of dread the butter chicken as one rarely gets a decent one) and the chicken tikka. I added a papri chat appetizer as well as had built an appetite after a long day. I spotted a lacha pratha a not so common bread so ordered it as well with garlic naan and rice.
The papri chat is decent would fix a quick snack fix. Decent version of this app.
Now for the mains I am glad we ordered medium spicy as the flavor got a chance to bloom and I expect this level of spice from the dishes of this region.
The butter chicken: the sauce was good and not the watery kind one gets at most places. Smooth yet flavorful. I ended up mopping the sauce of with bread.
Chicken tikka: they used white meat here but it was cooked properly. Well marinated so nice soft and juicy and not overcooked as in most cases. It comes on a sizzling platter of onions. 
I think we have a winner here for this cuisine and at this price point in this area worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Bhoj is a somewhat hidden, somewhat small Indian restaurant just a bit north of downtown. The service is really good, friendly and quick. However everything about them is just average. Quality, price, interior. So it would struggle to be anyone's favorite. It is just a regular option. However I think the prices are too high to be that option for most people."}
{"text":"The food is great here, but I'd probably do take out next time. 

We had the lamb kebabs, garlic naan, and palak paneer. Each dish was super flavourful, and portions were generous - we even took a bit home.  The dessert which was like some kind of frozen custard had ice crystals in it. Service was friendly.

The dining room was pretty small and the ventilation wasn't good so I'd come back to either pick up or for a casual bite."}
{"text":"Picked up an order from this place...service was a bit slow but later I realized it was worth the time. Food is absolutely delicious. Ordered goat curry, haryali chicken which was cooked in tandoor plus the usual naan and rice. Very impressed!!! They also give you an option of mild or spicy for each dish. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was optimal, perhaps in the top 3 in gta. It was served hot, as was the plate to retain the heat afterwards. Good attention to detail. Spiciness can be modified by customer. Great service by the waitress; was attentive in providing details of the dishes. But the spiciest option wasn't spicy enough. Overall, a great Indian restaurant worth a visit for anyone living in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"I have had food from Bhoj twice now. The first time the food was great, it all came out quickly and the flavones were fantastic. This was about a week after they had opened. 

My second time with Bhoj, I was so terribly disappointed. I ordered UberEATS (and yes I know delivery is never going to be as good as when you receive the food fresh) and each of the dishes were lacking, we had saag paneer, daal, butter chicken, as well as basmati rice, garlic naan, and the vegetarian sampler platter. This is essentially what we had ordered the first time, only this time there was a layer of grease on top of each dish (about 3 centimeters). I was definitely repulsed, but still thought that the flavors could be there, honestly who doesn't love some grease now and then, I won't be deterred by that. However this time there was basically no flavor. About 2 pieces of paneer in the saag paneer, the daal was overly salted and yet lacked flavor. 

I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately after such a poor experience I can't say I do."}
{"text":"I had delivery and it was very good. I liked the samosa, the tikki masala, and the rice was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"We are spoiled having such great Indian food from England, so very happy to report this food was awesome too. Perhaps the best naan bread ever! Cute little quaint place, excellent service too. Do get a reservation, as it is tiny and they do not rush you at all. Lovely!"}
{"text":"Came here during my birthday as I always choose Indian for my choice of bday meal if I can. Their stuffed cheesy naan is delicious. Quite filing so one is enough to go with your curry choice. I asked for extra spicy masala chicken and they did a good job getting the spice right with still being flavourful.

Service can be improved by being more speedy. Seems like they were fulfilling lots of take out orders at the same time."}
{"text":"$55 delivery arrived 3 min ago (see Photos)
2 chicken dishes
2 rice sides
1 naan bread
6-7 pieces of chicken cubes 2/3 soup for Dhaba chicken.
Lababdar slightly better.
During weekday we have Touch Indian restaurant underground in the PATH across from staples. Two to three times portion for 60% price. Same quality."}
{"text":"Lovely little restaurant in an unexpected location. We ordered all vegetarian on a rainy Friday evening and enjoyed our pakoras with chai. Everything was freshly prepared and served with a lot of care. My favourite part was the kindness of the staff. They genuinely wanted us to enjoy the food and our time here - and we did!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout and it was ready quickly and was delicious. I usually end up throwing out extra rice and naan when I order Indian food, but portions of naan and rice at this establishment are not large, so you may want to order an extra portion. I will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Doesn't serve nan with curries, somewhat affordable compared to Yorkville area, thali is only 2 curries and the chef picks one. Food is good depending on what you get, it's always fresh!"}
{"text":"This place has two solid things going for it - take out and customer service.

As a large group, I always wonder how a small space is able to execute a generally take your time cuisine. 

I can say, for the most part the Indian food we ordered lacked the depth of flavour familiar to most Indian spots I've experienced here. We ordered the chicken tikka masala, palak paneer and lamb biryani 

The onion bhaji- a deep fried appetizer was the highlight. Crispy and flavourful. The naans were good.

The masala tea which took time to prepare had no spices we were anticipating. We ordered in total 3 cups and the resounding review of it was steeped orange pekoe. 

However all that being said, the customer service was endearing. She always checked on us. Though forgetful and somewhat all over the place she was so friendly. Really made my experience much better."}
{"text":"This is a tiny place in an unlikely location on a busy street. It only seats about 22 diners and appears to do a good takeout business.

I ordered the lunch special, advertised on a chalkboard on the curb - 2 curries, rice, naan, salad, dessert.It was priced at whatever curry I chose from the menu. The other curry was the chef's choice. I found that a bit odd. Suppose I was served something that I'm allergic to or don't like? I wasn't offered a choice or asked for a preference.

Luckily, the chef chose chickpeas to go with my choice of butter chicken. I found the chicken a bit salty and the chickpeas lacking salt. Mixed together, it was balanced. It tasted okay but the portions were a little small. The naan was very good."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner at Bhoj and it was great. Started with samosas and then the Special Butter Chicken (spicier than the normal butter chicken). Super friendly and fast service. Highly recommend this gem just outside of Yorkville."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch and the food was outstanding! Had vegetable pakoras and chicken vindaloo and Dahl. Everything was great. 
The service was very good and the chef came out at the end to see how we liked it and we told him it was amazing!
Can't wait to go back! Best Indian food that I have had in a long time !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food. The spinach patties filled with goat cheese were delicious and very unique. Some of the classics: the paneer tikka, the chicken tikka and garlic naan were all very well done. Will definitely be returning here regularly!"}
{"text":"Very nice surprise of a restaurant. Delicious Indian. Tastes authentic. I had the lunch special which comes with naan, rice, lentils, dessert and butter chicken, all in one tray. 

I chose mild medium, but could've gone medium on the special butter chicken. It's got some cream so it's not spicy. 

Server was very nice and helpful. Food is 5 stars but the lunch tray was a bit odd. Kind of cheapens it even though it's kind of cute.  Perhaps dinner is different?

I would come back for dinner for sure."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Indian restaurants! Authentic Indian food with cooked spices and amazing presentation. The service is prompt, friendly, totally A+++. This was our first time to Toronto and we have travelled world! This is definitely on top of the list for Indian food. Dishes were freshly cooked. We had maincourse and deserts here. 
Best items we tried: Karahi paneer and daal makhani. 
We were so impressed with the food we ordered one of each deserts. 
Deserts: Ras malai and mango kulfi was A+++
Kheer was ok, Gulaab jamun was sub-par to all the other dishes we tried!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tucked away in Yorkville, this is a little gem of an Indian restaurant. I assume many don't know its charms due to its size and location (small but quaint and on a side street) but it is well worth the trek downtown. Their butter chicken is the best in the city! My husband loves the special version of the dish as it has some spice to it. We almost always opt for the pakora platter as well as it's a great starter with sinfully delicious fried onion and sweet potato nuggets."}
{"text":"Have to say, feel pretty let down by his meal. Ordered take out, and had heard good things about Bhoj, but regretting my decision now.

I went with the house special Buttered chicken, and while the flavours were okay, they did not make up for the ridiculously small portion I received. In total, for a $16.30 dish, I got 6 small cubes of chicken. Six. As an Englishman, I have eaten at more than my fair share of Indian restaurants, and this is by far the stingiest I have come across.

The naan and rice were adequate, granted. 

My Fiancé went with the tandoori chicken, and it was on the dry side. The flavours were overly salty and lacked any sort of kick you'd expect from the dish.

Again, the food isn't terrible, but is definitely not memorable."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town! The food is super tasty and their service is great too."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service + tasty food = one happy couple! Will definitely return because of those reasons!

My bf and I were looking for a late night bite and this Indian restaurant was able to fulfilled all of our criterias. Their dining area is separated from the entrance, which is very thoughtful considering the fact that there are a lot of take-out and foodora orders at night. Cute decor and very clean.

The waiters were attentive and dropped by a few times to refill our water. They confirmed the closing hours are 10pm on weekdays and 11pm on weekends, however they will happily accommodate if you arrive near the closing time."}
{"text":"Excellent. We came here for dinner and it was a very nice surprise. Very good quality. I loved the butter chicken and the lamb was also really good. The place was quite and fast and friendly serve. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Oh.em.gee their special butter chicken. Had a solo dinner with some wine, butter chicken, garlic naan and basmati rice. I dont think I have enjoyed food in this manner before! Place is small, quaint. Service was exceptional. Will be my goto in Toronto"}
{"text":"We had chicken tandoori, the signature butter chicken, and beef curry... everything was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"What can I say? I'm impressed. I frequent Little India and many of the Indian restaurants in Toronto and the GTA. This place is really good. I ordered take out. Butter chicken, tandoori chicken, bhindi  (okra), aloo gobi, onion salad, samosas, and onion kulcha bread. The bread was to die for. The bhindi was top notch and that's really hard to find. Really hard. The aloo gobi was great. The chicken dishes were great as well. I prefer dark meat across the board so my only critique would be that the butter chicken would be better and juicier if they used dark meat. The sauce was great. And for white meat it was still enjoyable for me and that never happens. There's only one place that does better tandoori chicken and it's in Little India. I requested the veg dishes be done adhering to strict allergies, which we always request and NEVER get. We are told that they will be modified and every time my husband gets sick. This time that didn't happen.  We are still in disbelief. So this place not only offers incredible quality of food, but also respects food allergies. I've found a new favorite restaurant. Pure comfort food and peace of mind. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Their special butter chicken and the fish tikka are both amazing dishes here. Best in GTA."}
