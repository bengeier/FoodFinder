{"text":"Jerk whole chicken is very tasty but the rice and peas was very dry. Great customer service though."}
{"text":"There are so many better options for jerk chicken near by (sunrise,shandras).  I would say the coleslaw is the best part of the meal.  However fairly priced and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Was in a hurry and decided to give this place a try ,  Ordered the small jerk chicken with white meat. The chicken was so dry and hard almost like a jerky, as if it had been re-heated multiple times after a few days of not being sold .  Bill came to $11.02 , and cashier decided to round up to $11.05 which is unethical since vendors are required to round down.  This establishment does not care about the quality of product they sell . Stay away"}
{"text":"Pay $9 for a box of rice, two small pieces of chicken, and a shot glass of coleslaw. I think the chicken tasted okay but it was hard to tell by the three bites I had."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken very juicy got two dinners for me and my brother the coleslaw was my favourite addition to he meal and the jerk chicken had a nice smokey taste to it recommend this place"}
{"text":"Worst jerk chicken roti I've ever had!  I bit into bones and it was so dry. I've never had a roti that didn't have sauce in it. It was literally just chunks of chicken and bones and potatos and carrots!? So weird!  Will definitely not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"just ordered this from ubereats. I got the ackee and saltfish with rice and peas and a side order of jerk chicken. Portion - huge - enough for two meals. Flavours - delicious! well seasoned and spiced and without being overly hot. The jerk chicken is moist and well spiced with a nice grill to it. The ackee and saltfish was tender and flavourful.  Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Solid soup, jerk and bbq chicken. I paid 6 for the value meal and it was terrific  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered from here one night last week. We ordered two large jerk chicken, one small jerk pork and two large oxtail. We recieved all the same small portion size and two jerk pork instead ine of them being chicken. The pork was so fatty and almost inedible. The chicken was dry and not meaty at all. The oxtail was almost $20 with tax and was still a small (repeating myself because it's unbelievable, Carribean spots usually give you more than you can eat). Wouldn't go back. Don't recommend at all"}
