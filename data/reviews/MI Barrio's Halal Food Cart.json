{"text":"When I first moved to the UNCC area I was driving down the road when I smelled the delicious scent of this place. The spices they cook their food with in this tiny 6x9 foot trailer can be smelled all the way down the road from the university. I ordered the lamb and chicken combo over rice, per suggestion of a buddy. It was pretty good, both meats were tender and flavorful, as well as the bed of rice below. I deffinitely will be back to better explore the menu soon!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte to visit my friends and they took me to this spot. The food was very tasty. They are open very late, so if you need a quick bite late in the night, I would recommend this palace."}
{"text":"Spectacular! The chicken and lamb over rice is my go to. You can't beat the quality (and quantity) of food for the price. Make sure to ask for some of the red sauce to go with your dish! Delicious, but I would recommend getting it on the side, it's rather spicy."}
{"text":"Best food in the university area by far, eat here as much as I can, fire. It's just fire"}
{"text":"*screech, U-turn!* Boy this cart looks REAL familiar! 

If you're an Uptown regular, you'll probably do a double-take when you see this cart. That's right, Mi Barrio's Latin Grill has opened up a second cart that currently sits in the parking lot Grey's bookstore near UNC Charlotte!

So the food? Go ahead and echo in the dozens of reviews from the first cart. I got the chicken lamb combo plate which is my usual at the Uptown cart and it's was nearly indistinguishable! The rice was cooked right and had the same lovely, aromatic spiciness. Chicken and Lamb were delicious, moist, and covered in that tangy white sauce famous from NY carts.

One downside, the guy running the cart today didn't seem all there. I asked him about Mi Barrio's and he wasn't even aware of what I was talking about (it's their commissary restaurant!). He donned gloves, took my cash, and then went to prepare my plate without re-washing w/ new gloves. I called him on it and he apologized and threw the gloves and styrofoam container away. At least it wasn't a big issue and it seemed like it was just an oversight, things happen and people aren't perfect! 

A few minutes later another guy pulled up who was looking over everything and looked like he was in charge. They really need to keep a manager there at all times watching over new/uninformed employees to ensure quality and food safety. Otherwise the food was fantastic! Will return."}
{"text":"Best food ever! Try the Philip cheesesteak and obviously the lamb chicken combo! Friendly people, excellent food!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend has ate at this cart a few times, and I don't usually eat halal but I tried it today. It was delicious and I am in love with their chicken over rice. Oh, and the rice was perfect, not grainy at all. Moist, not overdone and juicy. I did not expect this but I will return as long as I live in university. It doesn't break the bank either. Cash only y'all"}
{"text":"Chicken and lamb combo is my fav here! Also tried the chicken over rice which is good. Hot might be little spicy, so I'd recommend going medium spicy.

There's absolutely no difference in taste when compared with their food cart in uptown. Really good substitute option if you want to branch out from your routine."}
{"text":"Something has gone terribly wrong.  I want this place to do well and be great but it seems there has been a massive shift in how they operate.  The hours they operate seem to shift often and they open later and later.

The cleanliness isn't what is used to be.  I am concerned that they sometimes handle money with gloved hands and then use the same gloves to handle food.

Please read this review and ask them to get thibgs back on the right track."}
{"text":"Yummy. Everything I've eaten here has been very good. I would eat here everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"They get orders wrong often. If you have an dietary allergy I would avoid this place completely, I don't eat dairy and informed them to remove any cream or cheese based sauce and they made the order wrong three times. If you're into white sauce the food is decent, very unclean food truck and nice staff.

{"text":"I got the chicken and lamb combo over rice with white and hot sauce and it was absolutely delicious.  The meat and sauces were very flavorful and they give a large quantity. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Worked late and went here last night with my husband. Fantastic! Another busy day today, took my teen son, another hit! Can't beat the price. Busy even on a rainy night, so it must mean the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"I never would have thought to order here, but had to try it after seeing the reviews. It did not disappoint!  The chicken and lamb was delicious!  The portion was great for the price!  The only thing is it's cash only so have that handy."}
{"text":"This is the best food I've ever had around the University area. If you're a fan of meat, I would recommend you to try this place. Moderately priced, well cooked meat and spicy(if you're a fan). My choice is the Lamb over rice. I would always go back home happy with a wonderful meal. Best way to end your day I would say."}
{"text":"This is sooooo good, I always get the Chicken & Lamb over rice. My boyfriend loves it too!"}
