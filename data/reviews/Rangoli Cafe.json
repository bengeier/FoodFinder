{"text":"This resturaunt has gone through several name changes, and I've always noticed it on my way to work.  I love unusual or ethnic foods, so I'm actually pretty ashamed that it took me so long to finally have a meal here.    To be quite honest, I was a little taken aback when I walked in - it was dinnertime on a Friday night, and the place was completely empty.  All the tables were set, the lights were low, it looked like it was closed.  But it was open, and my friend and I were crazy hungry so we sat down anyway.  I saw an application for a liquor license on the front door, so hopefully that'll help their business pick up.   Service was prompt and friendly, and we were given thin crackers and a variety of dips/spreads/I don't know what they were, but they were delicious thingies to munch on while we made our selections (lamb saag, tandoori shrimp, garlic naan).  And then we settled in to wait. And wait. And wait. Honest to god, I don't know if I was just really, really hungry or if I really did wait as long as I felt like I did, but by the time the food showed up, it could have been utter crap and I still would have wolfed it down.  Luckily, it wasn't crap - it was AMAZING.  There were no survivors on this meal - we ate the entirety of everything we ordered.  The shrimp were enormous, the lamb was tender, and the flavors were intense and complex.  And the naan - ohhhh, the naan!  Frankly, the servings could have been a bit larger for what the prices were (our meal ran $20 each), but for the taste, it was well worth it.   Rangoli Cafe would have gotten 5 out of 5 if the food had been a bit quicker to arrive, and if the liquor license was already approved.  I will absolutely be returning here, and soon.  I only wish the lunch buffet was open on weekends so I could actually attend!"}
{"text":"The good: I have been here many times, for buffet and dinner. If you order Nothern Indian Food, its GREAT. Southern Indian Food is NOT that great, don't order any Biriyani...what I had was certainly not worthy of being called Biryani :). Dosa for lunch buffet was ok.  Very Spacious, good for conversations and privacy. Nice and tasteful Interiors. Looks new and very clean.  Apart from food, I like the songs bollywood songs playing in the background which I dont get to listen a lot these days.  The owner is a very hospitable person, hence this review :)  The bad: If you go alone, it can be a little expensive, they just raised the prices by a dollar for everything :(. All the times I have been there, there isn't much crowd and so for people who enjoy, people watching, not the best option, but if you like quiet and private kind of evening, its great.  Would have liked more TVs.   Overall, its worth a try and a great option"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet!  It's $7.99 per person on weekdays, a bit higher on the weekends.  The selection is terrific especially if you are a novice to Indian food - you get the benefit of trying a bunch of well prepared foods at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Indian food and often have cravings, so imagine my pleasant surprise when I discover this place is only minutes away from where I am staying by the Pittsburgh airport.  They've been open for 2+ years, but recently gone through a name change so that's perhaps why there are not that many reviews.  Lemme preface by saying that while I LOVE Indian food and have eaten from almost every type of \"establishment\" (or lack there of) from food carts, to fast-casual Indian food to nice classy restaurants and every buffet in between, I'm not sure if I'm a good arbitrator of the authenticity - I just know what tastes good, and this place hits the spot!  Only downside is that it is a bit pricey (have had comparable for less) and the prices quoted on the website are slightly different ($12.95 for many entrees vs. $13.95 actually)  Here's what I chowed on:  - Papadum, or the crispy thin crackers (complimentary) served with 3 different dipping sauces: spicy tomato chutney, tamarind and mint sauces (mild-spicy). Nice variety in the sauces, and good to munch on as you ponder what to order from their pretty full menu  - Vegetarian Samosas - 2 came out along with a light side salad. I do not often get samosas, but these were tasty with the perfect balance of crispy outside and soft, starchy goodness inside  - Mango lassi - delicious as always!  - Chicken Tikka Masala - asked them to make a milder version since I can't do spicy and it was deee-lish.  Cilantro sprinkled on top and just the right size chunks of chicken. Usually get Chicken Makhni (which they have too) but this did not disappoint.  - Garlic Naan - the BEST part of the meal and probably the best Garlic Naan I have ever had. Fluffy, melt in your mouth and crispy on the bottom with just the right amount of garlicky goodness.  Total bill for 1 + tax and tip came out to be approx $30, but I had plenty of leftovers.  The place was empty when I arrived - tucked back in the bottom of what is a motel/hotel on the side of University Dr, but beautifully decorated inside with classical(?) Indian music playing. The owner, Tony is real friendly and stopped by to chat.  Food was prepared fairly quickly and boxed up quite nicely to go!  Needless to say, my Indian food craving was quickly appeased!  Happy eating!"}
