{"text":"I love the Lox Bagel... First time I had a Bagel from here was 2 years ago, I left went back to the Bay Area with them on my mind. I am back 2 years later with them still on my mind. When I got back this was my first stop. I got my Lox Bagel!!! Ohhh and their jalapeno cream cheese is Hella Good!!!"}
{"text":"So I've been here a couple times over the last few years. Today was my third visit. I had a toasted spinach bagel with egg and cheese-yummy. I was sitting on the front patio when I noticed a bird struggling in a high branch of the palo verde tree nearest the building. The little sparrow had it's foot caught on the branch and was hanging upside down. It would flutter it's wings valiantly every few minutes trying to right itself, then hang helpless again. I wanted to help, but it was so high up I knew I couldn't climb all the way up. One of the staff members came out to see if everyone was happy so I pointed out the little bird and asked her if they had a long pole of some kind. She went back inside and came out with a ladder and a broom. So she set up the ladder and I was preparing to climb up with the broom stick to see if I could help free the bird.  Meanwhile everyone on the patio and passing by had stopped to see what was happening. I was about to climb up when another staff member came out to assess the situation. He quickly came up with a better solution and disappeared inside. Shortly he returned with an extendable pole that would easily reach the sparrow. After gently trying to nudge the bird free we all realized the entaglement was more serious. This kind man climbed the tree and with the help of another volunteer on the ground pulled the branch close enough to reach. He then gently captured the bird and brought it down. Both of its feet were badly tangled with some sortof stringy moss. The bird's thrashing had twisted ithe string so badly he would surely have died before breaking free. Everyone helped to untangle his feet and then we set the tiny sparrow free. High fives all around!
I will go out of my way to eat here and tell others about the awesome people who work at Hot Bagels and Deli. 

Moral of the story: They are really nice here-and the food is great too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch today. Long line but it moved quickly. They serve Boar's Head meats here on fresh bagels which make yummy sandwiches!!  Could use a bit more seating but then there wouldn't be any room for the line to order food!"}
{"text":"First time here and love this place already!!  The sausage, egg and cheese bagel was so good! The food also came out quick and was fresh. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great quick breakfast!  The bagel sandwiches were really good.  The chorizo burrito was fantastic!!!!!  Very friendly staff.  Would for sure stop by here again."}
{"text":"Love it. Perfect for a quick breakfast stop, love the bagel sandwiches! My two boys love to share a bacon, egg, and cheese. It can get crowded, and you have to listen up for your order when they call them out, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Everyones favorite in this neck of the woods! Wraps are tasty. I can get egg/cheese wrap all day too, not just in the AM! You can even call ahead your order too and skip the line. Don't forget to ask for the salsa too for your wrap or bagel, its tasty."}
{"text":"Can't give wrong with Hot Bagels. Just moved into the area and been here 3 times already. We bring guests since we know they'll enjoy the food."}
{"text":"After eating lunch with my family at this deli I saw a woman in the back cutting ready to eat food with her bear hands. When i aked to talk to the the food manager i was told there was nobody there with a food managers card. This is a huge violation of the health code! Handling ready to eat food with bear hands is a critical violation and there is supposed to be a food manager presant at all times. When i brought this to their attention their responce was \"Oh, you can call later and the manager might be in\".
Too bad because the food was pretty good and at a decent price. I just hope she washed her hands after using the bathroom"}
{"text":"Every time I'm here the line is practically out the door. What is that a good thing ? Because it's always amazing and who doesn't love seeing a family owned local business do well? Moving to a smaller town like Anthem smaller authentic places like these are somewhat hard to come by. This bagel shop is consistently staffed with pleasant people who want to please, incredible smells, and fresh food. There isn't a day I walk in and am not instantly taken back to my home town in New Jersey. I don't make it here half as much as I should, but after writing this tonight I think I'll go back for breakfast tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Fantastic bagels,crusty ,with the right amount of chewiness as well as texture and flavor.Delicious cream cheese ,hot breakfast sandwiches as well as deli.Just talked to a New Yorker friend of mine and she called it\"the only place besides New York that can serve a great bagel\"!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A.mazing...  Seriously. Just swing by and you'll see why. I always order the bacon egg and cheese bagel and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This bagel shop it great! The staff is nice and friendly. There bagels are always fresh. Great place for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The bagels are tasty, they have a good selection of cream cheese, good fresh brewed iced tea and a friendly staff.  They have a good selection of both bagels and cream cheese and do put the cream cheese on pretty thick."}
{"text":"Hot Bagel has the best bagels in town! It gets a little crowded sometimes and seating is often limited, but the wait time is generally short and you can always get a bagel to go if needed. They also have a great variety of pastries that are delicious. I would 10/10 recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Okay so my family and I have been coming here sporadically for a while now and the bagels and sandwiches have always been great. But, the most recent time that we were there they were almost completely out of bagels. I tried to order like 5 different types of bagels and all of them were gone, so I was forced to settle for plain. The staff wasn't rude or anything but they just seemed like they didn't really care and weren't super kind or helpful. I also specified multiple times, and they asked me a few times as well, for the bagel to be not toasted, and it came out toasted. Last little nit-picky thing that could very well just be me, is that the strawberry cream cheese looks and tastes like strawberry frosting. But still rating it three stars because they do have good food and great prices, it was most likely just one bad experience."}
{"text":"This is the best bagel shop in AZ! Excellent customer service and the bagels are to die for! The staff is super friendly and you're in and out w/ your order very quickly!"}
{"text":"Bagels are fresh, big, and yummy! Service is fast and friendly. A great place to grab breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I love hot bagel a little  pricy but DEFIANTLY worth the money I defiantly recommend this place for both breakfast and lunch, for lunch I typically get a turkey sandwich and they are great. They do put a lot of cream cheese on the bagels so if you don't like a bunch of cream cheese maybe just ask for light cream cheese everyone is super friendly their all in all I definitely recommend the place if your around the valley"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Excellent food, fast service, and a friendly staff. The use of fresh meats really completes the quality of the meal."}
{"text":"They have great bagels at a great price!  The place is small, so not much seating, but is worth stopping to pick up to go:)"}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing. Sent us out while crowded with untoasted (after asking for well toasted) bagels! And then to add insult to injury- the wrong bagel on our sandwich! We have much better lick with Starbucks - i have no idea how they have so many popular reviews! We are passing thru heading east and we were really looking forward to enjoying breakfast at this 5star location- 6 people cant be wrong and thats how many of us there were! Everyone of us - disappointed and no way to recover because hey are so crowded! 

If you want to try this place i would recommend going at whatever their least busy time is as they are a very small location! Or skip it and head to einstein bagels - crappy customer service but killer good bagels."}
{"text":"The staff is rude, and they were out of a lot of bagels everything by 1pm. I would not come back again, ever."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Breakfast burritos are SO good!  We always order Chorizo and egg and bacon and egg but they have other varieties.  You have to ask for no cheese though.  Otherwise, they put a ton on.  My kiddos of course don't mind but I'm not a fan of cheese on my eggs.   Also, they make their own fresh salsa and it's really good but you have to ask for it.  Kind of should be a given with burros but none the less, really good food!  They are also very quick and friendly so don't let long line scare you away. Oh, and their bagels are good too."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Growing up one of my favorite meals was having Taylored Ham for breakfast and this is this first place that I've found that serves it. The Taylored Ham/Egg/Cheese on everything bagel is a dream come true.

Another reason why I like this place is because unlike Einstein Bros. they really know how to load up a bagel with cream cheese.

The only fault is they really do not toast the bagels really well so you have to ask to have it double toasted."}
{"text":"Just the right amount of crusty-but-soft, warm, fresh bagels to be found in the Valley!  Very friendly, prompt service.  This will be our only stop if we want a REAL bagel!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here for the first time today. We tried the lox and bagel. So delicious. The staff was friendly too. They even allowed my modifications, and It was reasonably priced only $7.75. Great service great food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Fresh bagels, and a nice deli place. The service is great."}
{"text":"The sausage, egg and cheese bagel sandwiches are the best!!!  Get there early to claim a seat outside!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels and great service! Very friendly and very fast"}
{"text":"The absolutely best bagels in AZ. I like a hard shell and the staff always complies with my wishes. The line is always out the door but the staff quickly and efficiently eliminates any delays and always with a smile. This place has brought NJ & NY to AZ. If only they served pizza that drips down your chin."}
{"text":"Love to hit up a bagel place every once in a while and when we moved to the area would have drive miles to get any bagel. Now that we have Hot Bagels I hate to go anywhere else. The bagels are delicious and they put on a lot of cream cheese. If you like bagels you have to try this place."}
{"text":"Stopped here Tuesday morning for bagels and coffee. The place was filthy. Tables had food debris and floors and windows disgusting. But the worst part were the flies. I had to cover the part of the bagel that I wasn't eating so a fly wouldn't land on it. There was also a huge flying insect (not sure what it was) that almost landed on my husband. We ate fast and left. Never again. They need to clean up or shut down. One star because the bagel tasted good."}
{"text":"Awesome bagels. One of the best I've ever tasted. Place is small, but with ample chairs and tables both inside and al fresco. Service is super fast. Well except for us. Our server was quite taken by the young golfer gentleman ahead of us that we had to repeat our order 3x before she finally got it. Lol."}
{"text":"Stopped here with a group of 9 people on our way to Grand Canyon. Really good and fast service. Great Philly Sandwich. Bagels were also very good."}
{"text":"NY BAGELS!  Only ones I know of in AZ.  LOVE THEM!  Gotta have the breakfast special sandwich or the lunch special rare roast beef with mayo and hoagie juice!  We go every weekend if not more often!  Once  you try them you won't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos and sandwiches. I love that the lunch meats are all Boars Head brand. I sometimes buy my sliced sandwich meat by the pound here, too. Customer service is always good. Busy local spot for lunch. Line to the doors some of the time. They close at 4, which is a bummer sometimes."}
{"text":"The only legit deli in north Phoenix. The owners are from New Jersey and they know what they're doing! Great prices and amazing sandwiches."}
{"text":"Hot bagels has been a favorite of ours for many years. Everyone is always friendly. The food is always hot and made correctly for us. The cream cheeses are amazing. Everything seems to be pretty fresh. When I call and order and it is always ready when I show up to pick it up. We enjoy this place and will continue to go back"}
{"text":"My family just recently moved from New Jersey to Prescott. Up in Prescott there are only chain bagel places that are no where near as good as NJ bagels. On our way home from Scottsdale, we discovered this bagel shop. They are the best bagels we have found in all of Arizona. Next time we are down in the valley we will get 3 dozen bagels and freeze them because they are so good!"}
{"text":"Everything they have is delightful even their tea! Staff is friendly and personable! Favorite bagel place for sure"}
{"text":"Best bagel place I have ever been to.  I wish they had a cinnamon and sugar bagel.  But their hot bagels or croissants are delicious. Can't complain,  so fresh and great service. They'll need a bigger place eventually."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! This is my favorite location too. The best bagel sandwich you can buy. They use boars head meats and the bagels are always fresh, do yourself a favor and try this place if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Hot Bagels regularly for 7 years. In that time I've only got to try relatively few items on the menu. This is because I just can't get over some of the items that I keep eating for years. Their lunch sandwiches are bodacious. Their dessert items are scrumptious. The coffee is pretty good too. When friends come to visit from out of town, we are sure to go to Hot Bagels and Deli!"}
{"text":"1st time and the sandwich did not disappoint. Awesome.... the Philly cheesesteak is what i recommend.."}
{"text":"Love the lox bagels here but the last two times no decaf coffee and staff doesn't know when they'll have it again. Some people cant do caffeine for health reasons; theres something wrong with management when they don't think its important to offer it. Will amend the two star rating if and when they offer decaf again"}
{"text":"Another fantastic bagel and coffee this morning! So glad to have this place just down the street! Absolutely great! Rumor has it they are building a new location at 67th and happy valley! Very cool! Can't wait to try that one out! My favorite bagel is the traditional plain toasted with butter. So good!"}
{"text":"Normally this is a great place to get breakfast, great portions but today I got a jalapeño bagel with butter and cream cheese and I'm extremely dissatisfied with the amount of cream cheese. There's not even enough to cover the bagel."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today (once we found it) - loved it!  The sandwiches are delicious and a super good deal.  The bagels are great too!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Fast service, good food, hot coffee. The bagel breakfast sandwiches never disappoint. They have a good combo deal during the week with drink. I like that is a deli too so you can get meat, breads and cream cheese to go if you need it. The place is usually packed and they are very quick to roll orders out."}
{"text":"Bagels hot fresh .the help wow great on the ball get you in out and have a nice day can't say any thing bad"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite bagel shops around the valley. I like the fact that they have a couple different locations to go to. Not only that, but they have a variety of bagel options to choose from. Every time I walk into one of the bagel shop locations there are a variety of staff working. The bagels are delicious and I also enjoy their selection of cream cheeses."}
{"text":"Recently moved in this area and found this place. It's a great bagel shop and has a really wide variety of spreads and bagels. They offer other breakfast goods and sandwiches. Great customer service, friendly cashiers and fast service. Only waiting about 3 minutes for four bagels! Good atmosphere. Over all a great place If your wanting bagels. Try the honey walnut spread! It's the best!"}
{"text":"Why would anyone want to have a bagel loadedddd with sodium ??!!! There bagels are way too salty !!!!! Plus jalapeños bagels should not be pink ?!! I'll stick to Einstein bagels or a different breakfast place !!! No Thank you !!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre with very low stock. Didn't have most of what I wanted on the menu. However, I did to closer to the end of the day, and all the locals say it's their favorite little place. Must've caught them on a bad day?"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. 
Try the jalapeño bagel with garlic cream cheese with egg."}
{"text":"Great place hidden in a strip mall! Tasty breakfast bagel sandwiches & even breakfast burritos. Delicious coffee cake pastry, too. Love that they have Boar's Head deli meat..you can even buy some to take home for sandwiches during the week. 

Lines pretty long on weekends, but line moves pretty quick. Service is good & not a long wait to get your food."}
{"text":"This is part of a three or four store chain, mostly in North Phoenix area. This location is bigger and has a few more weird flavors, like blueberry/choc chip. The bagels are equally good at any locations and this comes from a true NY Bagel guy. The bakers Dozen is 10 bucks and the cream cheese is good too. The lunch sandwich special is a great deal as well. Very crowded on weekends, but worth a small wait. No freezer bags offered - minus one star."}
{"text":"Love this place. Bagels are great. Sandwiches are great. Bagel dogs are good. The Chorizo burritos are good. 

They have a frequent Bagel buyer Club.

Love this place"}
{"text":"Coffee and bagels are delish!"}
{"text":"You gotta stop going to Einsteins, this place is the real deal. So good--try the egg, cheese and bacon breakfast sandwich on a toasted sesame, you may never be the same again. For lunch, buffalo chicken boars head with cheddar on toasted sesame will surprise you. Really good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great breakfast and lunch specials! Bagels are always fresh and love that it is a family owned business as well :) The owner is so sweet, one time I had come in for a dozen bagels and left my debit card at home, but he let me take the bagels anyway with the promise to come back and pay!  I of course ran home with bagels in tow and came right back and paid, he was almost disappointed I came back so quickly, but there is NO place I know that would have been so kind!"}
{"text":"Amazing that every time I go into this place to give it a chance they are out of bagels except for Chili or everything. Can no one take inventory or understand sales numbers. Complete waste of time and gas."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time on a Saturday morning and the place was packed! Rightfully so as the food was amazing! We did have to wait for our food for awhile but there were 5 of us and they were busy. Food came out piping hot and smelled great. I ordered the sausage egg and cheese on a garlic bagel. I added cream cheese and it made it better in my opinion. Not too overpowering with the garlic either. My girlfriend got the chorizo burrito and it was one of the best. The salsa is spicy just FYI"}
{"text":"Paid $9 for a bagel with lox. Only had cream cheese and lox on it and was $9. Wanted it toasted and got it cold. Not even good. Not worth the money or time. They're too concerned about getting it out quickly than reading the ticket."}
{"text":"Being from New York I am Very picky about bagels. Hot bagels And deli has quickly become my go to bagel shop in the area! There bagels are house made and they are big and delicious! Try the nova lox it brings me right back to New York every time I have it! Staff is also very friendly. The owner thanks me every time I'm in. I definitely recommend this place to all bagel lovers!"}
{"text":"Passing through came here on a friday afternoon, not crowded at all. Ordered a pastrami reuben which came out quickly and was very good. Would try again for bagels if im ever in the area for breakfast. Seems to be a popular spot with the younger crowd."}
{"text":"Such a great local place! I love walking in the morning to get my delicious everything bagel with lox cream cheese spread! Always fresh always delish. My only critique would be the occasional Doughy bagel."}
{"text":"EVERY TIME i come here they are almost or COMPLETELY out of bagels i mean come on it's called hot bagels and you don't have bagels??"}
{"text":"This has been my go to weekend spot for breakfast for over a year now. Never been disappointed with the food or service. If the lines are out the door you still have your food in no time at all. Best bagel joint in Arizona !"}
{"text":"Have to give this place five stars because there is nothing like it here in Phoenix!  I'm from back east and finding REAL bagels out here is near impossible, let alone a Taylor ham,egg, and cheese sandwich.  The coffee is great too and everyone that works there is friendly and courteous.

It has a real neighborhood feel.  I am a P90X coach and they let me leave my business cards out and notices about my local workouts.  When I walk in, I almost always see at least two or three people I know...just a great place all the way around!!!"}
{"text":"Hot Bagels is our favorite place in the area.  We probably go here at least once a week.  Always a line but they are quick.  Great bagels!  I always get the everything bagel, it's so good!  Love the lox sandwich and all the breakfast sandwiches.  My daughter loves their strawberry cream cheese.    They have Boars Head meat which is the best!  Can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"The best bagels I have found in the Phoenix area, especially North Phoenix. Comparable to New York bagels, plus an excellent selection which includes pumpernickel, rye, as well as salt, onion, egg, wheat, sesame, poppy seed, spinach, everything, blueberry, cinnamon, etc. They have a nasty habit of running out of bagels, sometimes entirely, so if is later in the day, I would call first."}
{"text":"The bagels here are perfect, and if you get a bagel and lox, they don't scrimp on the lox or cream cheese!  Coffee is great and staff courteous.  My only complaint is they give you a bag of plain lays chips with your order.  I think I'd rather get nothing or a pickle.  Just kind of a random thing to go with a bagel.  Besides that, this place is great!"}
{"text":"It's great... When they don't run out of bagels. How does a bagel shop, run out of bagels? It's like a car dealership running out of cars. 30 minutes of my life that I won't get back driving here. Might want to call and check to see if they have inventory before you go."}
{"text":"I don't want to give this place a 5 star review because I don't want this place to get anymore crowded, but it is amazing and deserves every star! Always tastes fresh! Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always great tasting bagels, fast and quality service. Love to start my day with their breakfast sandwiches. Bardha the owner and her crew are on top of everything."}
{"text":"I've eaten here four times. The staff has so far been friendly, the meals have come in a timely manner, and the prices are pretty good. You get a sandwich, chips, and a fountain soda for around $7.

The bagels are above average, the meat is freshly sliced, and they use Boar's Head mustard. I don't like mayo or cheese on my sandwiches and these are still good enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Ex New Yorker always on the hunt for a good bagel. I would say the closest I've found in Phoenix. Staff is nice. Did not eat there but certainly would give it a try. You won't bother going any where else for bagels if you live Dove Valley/Sonoran Foothills."}
{"text":"How does a bagel place have no bagels?!!!! Over three hours left until the end of their business hours and they are completely out of bagels. Not one single bagel!! This is not the first time. Don't even bothering going after 10am, if you want any variety or any bagels! I live in the area, in which restaurant variety is lacking and one of the few restaurants, in the area, I can't even order their main menu item."}
{"text":"This place is the best I've ever had ! And the cinnamon rolls.....omg that are to die for ! Bagels are amazing and service is dead on .... a hidden gem"}
{"text":"So stingy with the Bacon, specifically order extra for my sandwich. They charge a $1.35 for extra and I get two pieces if that. They have great food but c'mon man, killing me with the bacon! If I lived closer I'd bring back probably more than half my sandwich's because of the petty amount of bacon. This happens literally every time."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  Best breakfast bagels in town, no more Einstein's for me!!"}
{"text":"Quality bagels made in-house. Located on Carefree Highway just east of I-17, Hot Bagels is good place to stop for a quick breakfast or lunch when traveling either way on I-17."}
{"text":"Best Bagels in Arizona hands down.  Serves Boars Head Deli meats and their sandwiches are fantastic.  They open EARLY! 5:30am so I make it a point to buy them on the weekends to bring home fresh warm bagels.  OH - they do a fantastic bagel dog as well ..."}
{"text":"The name says it all. This is one hot bagel shop! This could be one of the best bagel shops I've found in Phoenix and I would have never expected to find it way up in North Scottsdale. This bagel shop is delicious. The bagels are large, hot, soft and extremely delicious. This local eatery has a line out the door on weekends and it's for a reason. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are to-die-for. The cheese, egg and bacon combo sandwiched between a hefty bagel makes it worth waking up early on a Sunday morning! I will be visiting again soon for the deli because I hear that it's a must to stop by and experience their lunch."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Had a Taylor ham egg and cheese and pretty impressed scarfed it down!! Reasonably priced, 6 bucks for a sandwich and a coffee! Sign me up. My significant other got a lox with cream cheese and she said it was DELISH me personally not a fan of lox so I'll just take her word for it. Oh and you gotta try the crumb cake. Yum yum in my tum tum"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday morning while being a hot mess from Saturday nights festivities in hopes for a cure. A cure from a tequila overdose. Oh geeze... bagels galore! So fresh... so soft and chewy. So many choices. It reminds me I am a fat kid at heart. Wish it was closer to me... then I'd really be a fat kid. I swear it cured my hangover."}
{"text":"I am a bagel snob.

Bagel was quite large and when I saw it I expected it to be dense but it was rather light.

I got a salt bagel which had plenty of salt (particularly on the bottom of the bagel) with veggie cream cheese. I would rate it 5/5. 

I went on a Wed mid morning so there was not a crowd."}
{"text":"Driving from Phoenix to Vegas and needed a quick stop for some coffee and breakfast. I saw this place and decided to give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious bagel sandwich I had. The service was efficient and our food was ready quickly and the coffee was delicious (go figure). 
I'd consider driving out of my way to come and get bagels from here--they were that good! 
Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Rude employees. Not ever going back there. I'll goto a different location in hope that it will be better than this one."}
{"text":"Ok, forget the smoked white fish and the black/white cookies... this place doesn't need them!   This Hot Bagels and Deli is one of the Best places you will find anywhere around Phoenix for tasty bagels!  They are bagelicious!   If you don't believe me, then just stop by on a Saturday or Sunday morning and watch all of the bagel seeking peeps come into this place by the droves!  Yes, it's a great people watching place too :-)

A good bagel must be somewhat light and yet chewy on the inside and boiled and crisp on the outside.  This place knows how to make bagels better than most hands down. I hope you will give them a try.  Maybe I will see you there?!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in AZ.
Friendly Staff, clean store, GREAT food.
I'm there 2-4 times a week...if they weren't there I'd be at a loss for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Food's ok, but everyone that works there is a moron. Mess up the order every single time. I'm done with giving them chances."}
{"text":"Great bagels, staff for the most part is friendly with occasionally testy associates , however, it is early in the morning so I will cut them some slack."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of our favorite hometown bagel shop back east! Fresh yummy bagels, yummy breakfast made on the grill right in front of you! Great friendly staff. Seating inside & out! My favorite is a fried egg, bacon on a everything bagel! They get your order out to you fast also! But no rush to get you out if you want to sit with a friend and chat over breakfast & tea."}
{"text":"We love this place for a Saturday morning treat. They're seemingly always busy, which is always a good thing. The service is always fast and courteous and the bagels are great. We love the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on a spinach bagel. Also, try their various cream cheeses! So many to choose from!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad breakfast here. Fresh bagels and friendly staff, excellent experiences."}
{"text":"I got food.  That's the best I can say.  I waited 40 min.  The girl handed me my bag, matched my number with my receipt and said have a nice day.  Got home and it wasn't my order.  When I went back to complain there was the person who was in front of me originally...getting a refund.  The woman asked what I needed.  I told her my order was wrong, after I had to wait 40 min and went all the way home.  I wanted a refund.  She said it was my fault and I should have checked the bag.  I explained the girl matched the numbers, handed me the bag.  She told me it was fault, laughed it off and another girl got me a refund.  The food isn't that good, but not much to choose from in north gateway area."}
{"text":"Bought a Baker's dozen of bagels and was pretty disappointed by them. I was thinking based on reviews that they would be amazing. They were dry and hard. Maybe it was an off day and I'll have to try again."}
{"text":"My hubby went to pick up fresh bagels. He returned home with Onion and Everything. Both were delicious. The bagels are very big. They fit in our toaster. The cream cheese spread was every good too."}
{"text":"While I didn't have a bagel my sandwich was delish! I made a quick pit-stop here on the way to Flagstaff and ordered a turkey sandwich to go. Really, it was basic and super simple sandwich, but it all good quality. Boars Head meats and cheeses and they bake their bagels in house. Plus, it was super fast! This was especially convenient since I was on the go. I'd definitely stop here again. The service was fast and friendly and the food was good."}
{"text":"Awesome family bagel shop! Fresh bagels daily. Moderately priced (everything is $5-$8) and includes drink and chips. They use great quality meats and cheeses, and offer a loyalty program. I stop in almost every day that I am home for lunch. Open at 5:30am and close at 4pm. 

Weds tend to be busy due to the local high school getting out of class early- tends to be crowded and not a lot of seating for eating on site."}
{"text":"the week of thanksgiving, g and i were home, doing home improvement all week. so, after my daily trip to home depot i stopped in. they were busy, and service was curt but capable. i gave my order:  one normal, plain, as-it-is bagel with plain cream cheese on the side and a wheat bagel with veggie cream cheese. 

g does not like his bagel molested in any way. most places, even after i explicitly tell them not to, molest the bagel. hot bagels and deli didn't. g was surprised and happy. they  the bagels were tasty - a little crispy? on the outside and soft on the inside. bagel perfection. the cream cheese was rich and luxurious. i loved it, g loved it and we powered through the baseboard fueled by bagels."}
{"text":"Cheap quick breakfast, how can you go wrong?  Had an egg, sausage, and cheese on a sesame seed bagel.  I think it was like $4 or $5 and came out in a flash.  Definitely didn't expect a place like this off Carefree Highway.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Perfect way to start the day!! Make sure to get there earlier in the day for the best bagel selection."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years of and on and will say that the lunch special is amazing you can't beat the price and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Staff isn't always pleasant but the jalapeno cream cheese is awesome so I just take it to go!"}
{"text":"The best place I've ever found! They are so friendly, precise, quick and detailed! For the long lines, they make them move really fast! Plus you can call ahead and order, by time u pick it up it's ready! Their food is exceptional! Bagels are fresh, but usually by the afternoon their limited to very few types of bagels. The other small downfall they close so early (3pm) but they upside they also open super early so u can call put your order in and pick it up on the way to work no hassle! Their different options are great and their is an option for everybody! We've been going here since they've opened and their a family owned business and they show it!"}
{"text":"The best bagels I have had outside of NY.  Chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside, the way a bagel should be.  The service is fast and friendly and the prices are reasonable.  I wish they had a location in L.A., like within a block of my house.  OK, just come to my house and bring me bagels."}
{"text":"My bagel was very good and so was service. I sat inside and ate my bagel and then realized there were flies every where. I had also noticed a nat on one of the bagels in the case. I don't think I would go back here because of all the flies. They should keep the door shut. With flies comes other bugs..."}
{"text":"My favorite place for bagel with cream cheese or sandwiches!! They put healthy helpings of cream cheese which I like!! Absolutely the best"}
{"text":"Okay Brett P. Is an idiot. I live in Southern California and I stopped here for lunch while visiting family, this is the best bagel lunch I've ever had. The staff is very accommodating and the place is busy as hell. Those are all good things! I wish I had this place close to my house. Some people can never be pleased like ANYONE who leaves a one star review for this fine establishment."}
{"text":"Had a great bagel sandwich here today. The bagels are always fresh with a soft chewy inside you only get with a fresh bagel. Got the Boars Head turkey and Swiss which were both sliced thin and tasted very fresh. Been here a few times for the bagels and while they are very good, my only wish is they started making NY style bialis!"}
{"text":"Love their bagels and cream cheese! My favorite is the rye bagel with veggie cream cheese."}
{"text":"Double ham, egg, and cream cheese on an everything bagel; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this deli , it is the best on this side of town for sure . The bagels are fresh made every morning like you would get on the east coast . They have a Taylor ham breakfast sandwich , what else do you need ? If you don't know what it is , get it anyway ! It's like a mild salami and they fry it on the grill with the fresh egg (whole not that carton egg bs) . Fresh , affordable , super fast . Eat here !"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best bagel and deli shop ever. I grew up next to it so I may be a little biased. My favorite combo is a everything bagel with jalapeño cream cheese or a bacon, egg, and cheese on a jalapeño bagel... if you are ever there for lunch the BLTs are great!"}
{"text":"LOVE that we found this place heading up to Sedona. I ordered the lox/cream cheese/ caper bagel. AMAZING! Seriously, it was stacked super high with salmon! The bagels themselves were awesome- NO HOLES! we wondered, are people selling bagel holes now also?? BF had the ham/cheese sandwich. He devoured it! It was super fresh, fast, and delicious! 

would defientely come back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic bagel place! The bagels are big and fresh and their menu is HUGE. They make everything including their own cream cheese which is delicious. They have a great selection of deli meats and even pastry items."}
{"text":"i'm a late sleeper so i have to call and ask them to put whole wheat bagels aside for me.    the last few times they have been so hard.   i got some the other day and it took my sharpest knife to cut it in half.    i threw the rest out.    had that same experience with their bialys -- hard as a rock -- into the garbage.   i'm from NYC so i know how bagels should be.   i call around 10am -- even if they were made at 6am i don't think they should be so hard.   i wonder if they make more later.    they run out of whole wheat and pumpernickel fast.    i just bought a few poppy seed bagels in albertson's and they feel like bagels are supposed to."}
{"text":"If this place ever shuts down, you will find me curled up in the fetal position rocking myself outside their locked doors. I love this place more and more each time I go. Now, mind you, this place will never shut down because each time I've been there it is PACKED. It doesn't matter when you go, even today at 10am on a Thursday, there were easily twenty people inside the tiny shop. Apparently none of these people have real jobs. Whatever, I don't care about them. I care about my fabulous bagel-liciousness. Yes. I made that word up. I think Webster should pay me royalties, in the form of hot bagels. 

This place makes all their bagels from scratch each morning. Get there at the right time and you can have one hot out of the oven. Mmm. It is heaven in a paper bag. The bagels are hand rolled, then boiled and baked. The end result is a crispy exterior and soft, chewy inside. 

I suggest the breakfast sandwich. They will whip up the best bagel sandwich with your choice of breakfast meat, cheese and egg in no time. (Seriously, I have no idea how they cook it so fast, but I know they don't cook them ahead of time, because the cook top is out in the open for everyone to see.) 

Once, my husband and I were in a hurry to get to the airport. It was some ungodly hour in the morning, and we were starving. I couldn't bring myself to do the drivethru at the McDonald's across the street. Just couldn't do it when I knew my bagel-liciousness was just a few hundred feet away. So we called them on our way and asked if they could make the sandwiches ahead of time. They were more than happy to. When we ran in, our bagel sandwiches were wrapped up and in a bag, ready for us to run off to the airport. The family that runs this place is great. 

I'll never look at another bagel the same. I love this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! I used to be annoyed with how rude/hasty the staff was and how they would always run out of the good bagels early, but the last few times I've gone I've noticed overall improvement. The jalapeño bagels are on point, as are the cinnamon rolls. Jessica is a doll!"}
{"text":"My husband and I travel over 20 minutes for bagels at this shop! We were just driving by one day after a dr appt. and found it on a fluke. Everything bagel and jalapeno bagels are our favorite. Also love the cream cheese with chives spread. Coming from NY I know a good bagel and this place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"They have really good breakfast sandwiches at a great price.  The bagels are always fresh & tasty."}
{"text":"Really tasty sandwiches here and good service (polite, clean, fairly quick) . My only knock on this place is that the lunch rush is so busy sometimes bc everyone else seems to enjoy tasty sandwiches as well. Great lunch place, moderately priced, but well worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has taken me here three times since we've been back home for the Winter and I LOVE IT. The first time was a weekday morning and we had their breakfast special. Sausage and egg on croissant. Totally melt in your mouth perfection. The second time I had to try the lox and cream cheese with capers and onion. They hit it out of the park again! I had it on the everything bagel, but chose not to toast it. You also get potato chips and a drink with the sandwich. Last time we went I got the lox again but this time on the onion bagel, and toasted. It was somehow even more amazing.

We can't leave here without getting a handful of their hot sauce packets, I don't even know why but they are delicious. Also one of their chocolate danish pastries that are mouth watering.

Everyone here is super friendly and your food comes out lighting fast and super fresh no matter how packed they are. Can't give it more than 5 stars or else I would."}
{"text":"Great place run by great people!  I know the bagels are killer, but I always go for the toasted croissant with two fresh eggs, taylor ham, sausage and Swiss cheese.   Service is lightning fast most days even when there is a line.  Best breakfast sandwich in the area by far."}
{"text":"This place is solid. My favorite is their bacon,egg, and cheese on a toasted everything bagel. As for people saying it's sold out whenever they go what do you expect? They open at 5:30am! It's a little store that is very popular in the mornings. If you want a specific type get there earlier- otherwise don't be so picky! Had a chicken salad sandwich today which was decent but not the best ever- hence the 4/5 star review."}
{"text":"This place has old school pretzel dogs that seem homemade.  Even if they came out of a box in the back, they are amazing!  I'm pretty sure they must be homemade.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I have been to many sandwich places in the valley over many years, but this place is without a doubt the best. We used to live nearby, and would go here for breakfast and lunch regularly. Since we moved to the east valley we only make it up occasionally, but it's worth the 1 hour drive...honestly it is. New York bagel enthusiasts, GO HERE. This is the closest thing to true New York bagels I've found in the entire Phoenix area. My only wish is it was a bigger place with more seating. They are always crowded when I go, and they deserve the business. The bagels are made right, the eggs, bacon, etc. are made on a grill, and the deli meats are always good. We often plan our weekend errands around excuses to end up in the north valley because of this place."}
{"text":"Store baked bagels in a wide variety.  Boar 's Head cheeses and meats.  Very reasonable prices.  This is the place.   Need I say more.   Don.t miss this place!"}
{"text":"Super friendly, quick service and the BEST bagels EVER!!!Lots of different bagel choices to choose from. I happened to be in the area for work but will be stopping at the other locations closer to home for our bagel fix."}
{"text":"Just as an FYI Lox on a bagel is not cooked salmon with egg and onion.  After you make the wrong sandwich and charge me the wrong amount don't proceed to tell me I ordered the wrong thing and then tell me to come back in to pay the difference after. Just because you write the word \"LOX\" on the board don't tell me that means cooked salmon and eggs.     Don't proceed to keep telling me I am wrong.  All you had to say was sorry and not add insult to injury.  I will not be back in over this incident.  Heres an idea if I write the red apples for sale in green lettering you should expect to get green apples right? Totally moronic! I would expect a bagel place to know what LOX is.  That was my mistake.  First mistake was giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep giving this location a chance. I know it's a busy Sunday morning. I work in customer service as well. I know how crazy Sundays can be after church. But when u have two people standing and doing nothing along with it taking 25 min after ordering to get food. Unacceptable. Also, one half of the bagal had NO cream cheese. When a small child sees that they flip out. It wasn't good at all. All the other locations do so well, but not this one"}
{"text":"Love their food. Awesome sandwiches and bagels. Wish they had better coffee though. All around great place. Friendly and nice staff. I love coming here and would recommend it to all."}
{"text":"Average at best.  Bagels are very salty every time and service is not very friendly.  It will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"One of... If not the best bagel place I've been too! This place has amazing breakfast bagels and not only a great price but also very delicious. They also have add-ons like an extra egg or cheese or even meats.. A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for Brunch today. Quick, friendly service. Lots of different flavor bagels to choose from. Hot, delicious food!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is best sandwiches and bagels ever! I frequent this place often and its never a let down! The rueben sandwich is amazing!"}
{"text":"Bagels are authentic... meats and cheeses are Boar's Head.  We've never had anything less than wonderful!   The folks who run the place are courteous and personable.  All kinds of patrons and everyone is welcomed.  I get a bakers dozen of bagels and freeze them for later use- they are great then too."}
{"text":"I don't like this place, but since it's the only place in the neighborhood to go for a bagel, I end up here too often.

The cinnamon-raisin bagel might have a total of 3 raisins in the entire bagel.  This has happened to me sooo many times, that I have stopped ordering it.  I feel like I'm just eating a cinnamon bagel. 

You have to ask them to double toast your bagel.  If not, you will find that you have a luke-warm bagel with butter on it.  Ick.  I like my bagel browned just a little bit.

But I'm sure I will continue to come here until something better opens up nearby."}
{"text":"fast became our favorite breakfast spot.  love the breakfast special-even more when we found out we could have the gyro meat.  good coffee and our grandkids would rather eat there than just about any place else!"}
{"text":"Chorizo burrito was a decent size and well-priced. Great tasting place with a short wait, even during breakfast rush."}
{"text":"First, Let me say Boar's head meat.  The best!  Price is very reasonable.  Each sandwich comes with chips and drink.  Ice tea is very good.  Service is great and fast!  seating is inside and outside, now that the weather is getting good it was nice to sit outside.  You can get your sandwich on a bagel or different types of bread."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches! Stopped by here on our way back to California returning from Sedona. It had great Yelp reviews and pictures, so we automatically decided on stopping for lunch.

Since it was our first time, we asked the lady taking our order what the most popular bread choice for their sandwiches. She responded by simply naming every bread they have. That did not help and did not answer my question. 

We ordered turkey sandwiches and they were awesome (wish they offered avocado). But I don't like it when sandwich joints don't stack their meats and toppings evenly. Makes it difficult to eat and shows that they don't put care and time into building your sandwich."}
